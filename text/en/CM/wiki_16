<text>Sabah Parks () is a conservation-based statutory body established in 1964 with the purpose of conserving the scenic, scientific and historic heritage of the state of Sabah, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. The organisation is also responsible for the management and promotion of the various protected reserves in Sabah, in particular those designated as national parks. It is also mandated to develop tourism-friendly facilities to accommodate tourist arrivals to these reserves and ensure that the state of the reserves is not compromised. The first choice for inclusion in a park system was Mount Kinabalu. As a result, Kinabalu Park was gazetted in 1964, and today it is designated as a World Heritage Site.

Sabah Parks is managed by a board of trustees also known as Sabah Parks Trustees, which consists of a chairman, deputy chairman, three &quot;ex officio&quot; members, four other members, and a director.

<doc id="1196215" wikidata="Q218898" url="?curid=1196215" title="Elongated triangular cupola">
<text>In geometry, the elongated triangular cupola is a polyhedron constructed from a hexagonal prism by attaching a triangular cupola. It is an example of a Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated triangular cupola is constructed from a hexagonal prism by attaching a triangular cupola onto one of its bases, a process known as the elongation. This cupola covers the hexagonal face so that the resulting polyhedron has four equilateral triangles, nine squares, and one regular hexagon. A convex polyhedron in which all of the faces are regular polygons is the Johnson solid. The elongated triangular cupola is one of them, enumerated as the eighteenth Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area of an elongated triangular cupola formula_2 is the sum of all polygonal face&#x27;s area. The volume of an elongated triangular cupola can be ascertained by dissecting it into a cupola and a hexagonal prism, after which summing their volume. Given the edge length formula_3, its surface and volume can be formulated as:
formula_4
It has the three-dimensional same symmetry as the triangular cupola, the cyclic group formula_5 of order 6. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of a triangular cupola and a hexagonal prism:
* the dihedral angle of an elongated triangular cupola between square-to-triangle is that of a triangular cupola between those: 125.3°;
* the dihedral angle of an elongated triangular cupola between two adjacent squares is that of a hexagonal prism, the internal angle of its base 120°;
* the dihedral angle of a hexagonal prism between square-to-hexagon is 90°, that of a triangular cupola between square-to-hexagon is 54.7°, and that of a triangular cupola between triangle-to-hexagonal is an 70.5°. Therefore, the elongated triangular cupola between square-to-square and triangle-to-square, on the edge where a triangular cupola is attached to a hexagonal prism, is 90° + 54.7° = 144.7° and 90° + 70.5° = 166.5° respectively.

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated triangular cupola is one of the Johnson solids (&quot;J&quot;22). It can be constructed by attaching a hexagonal antiprism to the base of a triangular cupola (&quot;J&quot;3). This is called &quot;gyroelongation&quot;, which means that an antiprism is joined to the base of a solid, or between the bases of more than one solid.

The gyroelongated triangular cupola can also be seen as a gyroelongated triangular bicupola (&quot;J&quot;44) with one triangular cupola removed. Like all cupolae, the base polygon has twice as many sides as the top (in this case, the bottom polygon is a hexagon because the top is a triangle).

==Formulae==
The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length &quot;a&quot;:

:formula_1

:formula_2

== Dual polyhedron ==

The dual of the gyroelongated triangular cupola has 15 faces: 6 kites, 3 rhombi, and 6 pentagons.

<doc id="1196224" wikidata="Q1112661" url="?curid=1196224" title="Legal Drug">
<text>is a manga series by Clamp. The main artist in this serialization is Tsubaki Nekoi. It is published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten and it is published in English by Tokyopop who have currently released 3 volumes as of 2005. The series is also known as &quot;Lawful Drugstore&quot; or &quot;Gouhou Drug&quot; in Japan. Since then, however, the license has lapsed, and Dark Horse Comics picked up the publishing rights in 2014.

The series was put on hold in 2003, as the magazine it was serialized in ceased its publication. It resumed serialization in November 2011 in Kadokawa&#x27;s &quot;Young Ace Magazine&quot; under the new title, .

The four leading characters of Legal Drug appear in &quot;CLAMP in Wonderland&quot; 2, which is the first time Kakei and Saiga are seen animated; Kazahaya and Rikuo had been previously animated during a brief appearance in the &quot;xxxHolic&quot; anime, episode 6, and &quot;xxxHolic Kei&quot; episode 13.

==Plot==
When Kazahaya Kudo collapsed in the snow one night and on the verge of death, he is rescued by a mysterious young man, Rikuo Himura, who takes him back to a pharmacy named the Green Drugstore.

Kazahaya, apparently running from his past, takes up work at the Green Drugstore alongside Rikuo. He comments that although Rikuo rescued him, he really feels indebted to the store&#x27;s owner, Kakei, whom he thanks for his current accommodation and job. While their day job is quite simple, the boys are persuaded and, in some cases, practically forced by Kakei to take on strange extra jobs outside the store, which make use of their supernatural powers.

==Characters==
:
:The main protagonist of the series. Above all else, Kazahaya does not want to die - a fact which seems to be linked to a girl from his past named Kei, his twin sister. In his thoughts, he has indicated that he and Kei lived a secluded life, effectively trapped on a single property where no other children lived, and also indicates that neither he nor Kei ever finished their schooling even at the elementary level.
:At the very start of the series, Kazahaya is found lying in the snow, having apparently run away from his former home and very nearly freezing to death, before being found by Rikuo, who brings him back to the Green Drugstore. Since then, he has always been trying to earn money so that he might live alone, which is the main reason why he accepts the &#x27;extra&#x27; jobs offered by Kakei. He has a supernatural power which is something like psychometry in that he can see the &quot;memories&quot; of things or persons when he touches them; he may also possess some empathic ability as he seems capable of absorbing emotions as well as memories, and on at least one occasion has channeled the present visual perspective of another person (Rikuo).
:While at times he may seem rather helpless, or at least hopelessly naive, he has many skills and abilities which make him highly capable in certain tasks. Specifically, some of his behaviors and abilities seem remarkably similar to a cat, including a heightened sense of smell and vision, several demonstrations of cat-like agility and speed, and his tendency to look like an angry kitten when upset. Kazahaya is noted to be seventeen-years-old at the start of the series, and is smaller, slimmer and has a much more feminine appearance than Rikuo, to the point that he can be accurately described as &quot;pretty&quot;. He gets emotional easily, and frequently plays into Rikuo&#x27;s hands when teased due to his quick temper.
:In &quot;Drug &amp; Drop&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that he is related by blood to Shuichiro Kudo from &quot;Wish&quot; and that their family is a very powerful one.
:
:The second protagonist of the series, Rikuo is Kazahaya&#x27;s current co-worker and roommate, as well as the one who found Kazahaya lying nearly dead in the snow. Similarly to Kazahaya, his mysterious past is also centered on a woman, this one named Tsukiko. It appears that they lived together at some point, though at present the exact nature of their relationship remains unknown. Rikuo often comes across as being cold and insensitive, sometimes even sarcastic, and takes great pleasure in teasing Kazahaya. However, in spite of his nature, he is always the one who comes to Kazahaya&#x27;s rescue when certain jobs go wrong. He has powers similar to telekinesis, as he can break things like cups, locks and branches.
:Kazahaya claims that he and Rikuo are the same age, meaning Rikuo is also 17. Of the two protagonists, Rikuo is much calmer and quieter, and in appearance is taller and more masculine - high-school girls appear to come to the store often specifically to ask Rikuo where some random item is as an excuse to talk to the handsome boy. Rikuo has tattoos on his right shoulder and back, which has been implied to have a connection to Tsukiko. An interesting quirk about Rikuo is that he likes sweet things such as chocolate, which is considered unusual and un-masculine in Japanese society.
:The owner of the Green Drugstore, Kakei is the one who sends the two boys out on missions, usually without telling them everything first. He seems to know exactly how things will turn out due to his power of precognition, however it has been noted that this power cannot be used on someone more powerful than himself, as in the case of his failures to find Tsukiko for Rikuo.
:Kakei is a very beautiful person and has a gentle, kindly air about him. However, he is also very mysterious, and his expression often changes quickly from gentle and kindly to eerie and perhaps even dangerous. He is also noted to have a cruel, and even sadistic side to his nature, although this side of his personality is mostly actualized in almost-subtle teasing. It turns out that the reason he opened the Drugstore is in order to protect Kazahaya and everyone he cares about.
:It is later revealed that Kakei and Saiga&#x27;s true forms are Hisui and Kokuyo from &quot;Wish&quot;, but many years after the events that took place in that story. 
:Saiga is often seen hanging around in the Green Drugstore - usually napping, smoking, or both. He also always wears a pair of dark sunglasses which he never seems to take off. While it is unknown whether he has any supernatural powers like the rest of the cast, it was mentioned that he is extremely good at pickup souls, finding people, and is currently working on helping Rikuo find Tsukiko. He is Kakei&#x27;s lover and is skilled in domestic areas, such as sewing and making food.

===Minor characters===
:Kei is Kazahaya&#x27;s sister and not much is known about her, although Kazahaya mentioned that she has &quot;cat-like&quot; qualities. The reason Kazahaya left her has not yet been clarified; his only explanation is a guilty, &quot;But if we had stayed together, it would have been either you or me.&quot; It is revealed in Drug and Drop that she can see the future of objects by touching them, similar to Kazahaya&#x27;s ability to see the past.
:Tsukiko is a woman from Rikuo&#x27;s past who has gone missing. It is thought she may be dead as when she went missing Rikuo found her room &quot;all splattered with blood&quot;. Her relationship with Rikuo is unknown; he is determined to find her and is certain that she is still alive. It has been implied that Tsukiko cannot swim and that Rikuo once saved her from drowning. In recent chapters it is clarified that Tsukiko is Rikou&#x27;s elder sister, and also his only living blood relative. She appears in one of Kazahaya&#x27;s dreams and speaks to him, suggesting an ability to enter dreams. She can also see the future, albeit only a day or so ahead. 
:Satoru is a student at an all-boys private school. He is Vice President on the student-body government and was a victim of attempted rape. Unbeknown to his classmates and himself, he has the ability to project a piece of his soul out of his body in order to fulfill the desires of his subconscious.

==Crossover with other CLAMP works==
In the second volume of &quot;Legal Drug&quot;, Kakei purchases clothes from &quot;Piffle Princess&quot; for Kazahaya to give to a girl from Ohto High in exchange for her uniform. In &quot;Angelic Layer&quot;, this was a store selling &quot;Angelic Layer&quot; merchandise where people could practice fighting with their Angels. In &quot;Suki&quot;, Piffle Princess appears as Caffe Piffle Princess, a café frequented by the main characters. Piffle Princess also appears in other CLAMP works, including &quot;Chobits&quot;, &quot;xxxHolic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Kobato&quot;, and &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;.

In the world in which &quot;Legal Drug&quot; occurs, Piffle Princess appears to be a popular clothing store. A dress from Piffle Princess is given to a student at also known as (the Japanese word for vomit (謳吐) is also spelled Ohto). Hinata Asahi from &quot;Suki&quot; — Hinata, her teacher Shiro Asou, and Ohto High all appear in &quot;Suki&quot; as well.

The Atashi character from &quot;Chobits&quot; appears, such as on a clock in the Green Drugstore.

Rikuo and Kazahaya have appeared in &quot;xxxHolic&quot;; Watanuki is sent out to purchase a hangover remedy and enters the drugstore where the two work. He sees ghostly images around them (Tsukiko and Kei) and observes that there is some strong bond between the two. Furthermore, the High Moon Urn Yūko Ichihara has obtained in volume 5 from the &quot;anything store&quot; is actually the same vase retrieved by Kazahaya and Rikuo in volume 2 of &quot;Legal Drug&quot;. In volume 2, Kazahaya walks through the space between a telephone pole and a wall, as does Watanuki in &quot;xxxHolic&quot;. Watanuki, after inheriting the shop from Yuko, appears as Kakei&#x27;s customer in &quot;Drug &amp; Drop&quot;.

The Green Drugstore and its staff have made small appearances in &quot;Kobato&quot;. The Green Drugstore, Kakei, Rikuo and Kazahaya are identifiable in the background of &quot;Drop 5&quot; and two characters who look like Rikuo and Kazahaya walk past Kobato in &quot;Exam 9&quot;.

Kohaku from &quot;Wish&quot; has appeared recently in this series.

==Release==
Written by Clamp, the chapters of &quot;Legal Drug&quot; appeared as a serial in the manga magazine &quot;Mystery DX&quot; from

<text>Pekan is a town in Pekan District, Pahang, Malaysia. It is also the royal capital of the state. Its name comes from a flower, the &quot;Bunga Pekan&quot;. Pekan is also the name of the district the town is situated in, and a parliamentary constituency in its own right. It is the home of the state&#x27;s royal family headed by Sultan Abdullah of Pahang. It is also the hometown of the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak Hussein.

The Masjid Abdullah, a landmark in Pekan which dates from the 1920s, and the newer Abu Bakar Royal Mosque is near the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum. The stretch by the river bank from the Abu Bakar Royal Mosque heading towards the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum is Pekan&#x27;s Heritage Route.

==History==
According to local lore, a flowering plant named &quot;Bunga Pekan&quot; used to grow wild along the banks of Pahang River, and the town was therefore so named. The flower is said to be white like jasmine, although the particular plant species is also said to have become extinct. The river at the Pekan town (near Mengkasar village) is also called Pekan River, however there is no evidence that Pekan derived its name from this river. Other sources say the name &quot;Pekan&quot; came from &quot;Pekan Sehari&quot; (Pekan Sehari or Sunday Market still exists today), and the word &quot;Sehari&quot; was eventually omitted and the locals simply called it &quot;Pekan&quot;.

Pekan is thought to have been in existence since the time of Old Pahang Kingdom. The old name was Inderapura, although it was also commonly known with the short form &#x27;Pura&#x27;, which some Malays called Pekan. The old capital was located on both the left and right banks of Sungai Pahang and Sungai Pahang Tua up to Tanjung Langgar. The town was divided into Pekan Baharu and Pekan Lama (New and Old Pekan), and the old name for Pekan Baharu used to be Kampung Cina. Several Arab and Chinese writers mentioned Pekan.

During the late 19th century, relations between the sultan and local villagers were close. For example, when a gong in the palace was struck, local villagers would assemble to the palace for the sultan&#x27;s service such as accompanying him on a hunting expedition.

The villagers at Kampong Mengkasar, about one kilometre from Pekan in the direction of Kuantan, are said to be direct descendants of Tok Tuan from Makassar in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Among the well-known figures, Tun Abdul Razak was recognised as having a Sulawesi heritage.

==Transport==

===Car===
From Kuantan, Pekan is accessible by 3 routes, namely Tanjung Lumpur Highway (Federal Route 183) which runs through Tanjung Lumpur, Penor and Ceruk Paloh, Jalan Pekan (Federal Route 3 and ) and also through Gambang, Pahang by Tun Razak Highway (Federal Route 12). From Kuala Lumpur, one may travel to Pekan by the East Coast Expressway, exiting at the Gambang Interchange to the Tun Razak Highway. From Johor, a scenic coastal road passes through Kuala Rompin. Alternatively, the Tun Razak Highway can be taken, which links Segamat and Kuantan.

===Public transport===
The rapidKuantan bus route 400 connects Pekan to Kuantan.

==Places of interest==

=== Sultan Abu Bakar Museum===

The Sultan Abu Bakar Museum displays many artefacts which are important in the state&#x27;s history and the local Malay culture. The museum was officially opened by Sultan Ahmad Shah in October 1976. It is located in the former residence of the British Resident, which was built in 1929. It was acquired by the Sultan of Pahang in 1948 and was renamed Kota Beram Palace. In 1965, the Sultan moved his residence to a new palace (the Abu Bakar Palace), where the current Royal Palace is situated.

The museum was officially opened to the public in October 1976, in conjunction with the birthday celebrations of the Sultan of Pahang. The first chairman of the museum was the late YBhg. Dato&#x27; Haji Mohd Mokhtar bin Haji Daud, and the first director/curator was YBhg. Dato&#x27; Mohamed Mokhtar bin Haji Abu Bakar. The museum expanded its collections of artefacts very actively during this era up to 1997. The locals eagerly surrendered and provided as gifts certain unique artefacts to the museum. One example of these is a keris (a type of Malay dagger) which was found by a young man in a river about 20 km from the town of Pekan. This particular keris drew a lot of attention, coupled with strange stories of its mystical prowess. The keris is still on display at the museum.

The museum has dedicated galleries focusing on water transportation, personal belongings of the late Sultan Abu Bakar and the late Tengku Ampuan Pahang Tengku Afzan.

As of October 2008, the museum has been undergoing renovations. Visitors are advised to call the museum first for more information.

===The Chiefs&#x27; Rest House===
Pekan is home to the Chiefs&#x27; Rest House. This wooden structure was completed in 1926 and is featured in the &#x27;Lonely Planet&#x27; Travel Guide as a must-visit site in Pekan. It was originally built by the British as a guest house for the Chieftains in Pahang who visited Pekan to attend meetings and events at the Istana. Until today, the Chiefs&#x27; Rest House offers good, clean and reasonable accommodation to travellers.

Most of the furnitures adorning this building were brought over from the Istana. It is advisable to reserve your room in advance, as it can be packed during school holidays, weekends and whenever there are functions in the Istana. The Chiefs&#x27; Rest House is located along Jalan Istana Abu Bakar in Pekan. It is along the road approaching the Istana area.

Pekan offers a variety of delicious food. Being a Royal Town, Pekan enjoys the best kuih-muih (Malay delicacies) which are prepared by the same people or their descendants who used to prepare the same delicacies for the palace. Breakfast menu is aplenty to choose from. One particular novelty for breakfast is the &#x27;roti naik&#x27; (a heavenly treat. Looks similar to small buns sold in supermarkets, but with a completely different taste, especially when it is hot). This particular bread can only be found in very few places, Pekan being one of them. Other delicacies are nasi dagang, kuih bakar, ikan bakar (fresh grilled fish) and others.

Kampong Mengkasar is also well known of its Murtabak. It is a unique variant of the original Indian dish that can only be found in Pekan. The &quot;Murtabak Pekan&quot; was not started in Kampong Mengkasar, but it is available here throughout the year.

<text>Langley or Langley-on-Tyne is a small village in Northumberland, England, located to the west of Hexham.

The village is on the A686 about south of Haydon Bridge. The skyline of Langley on Tyne is still dominated by the lead smelting chimney with its underground flue leading to the old smelt works, now a sawmill, where the old tracks for the ore wagons can still be seen. There are currently just over 100 residents.

== Governance ==
Langley is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Joe Morris of the Labour Party is the Member of Parliament.

For Local Government purposes it belongs to Northumberland County Council a unitary authority, with Langley lying in the &quot;Tynedale Division&quot;. Prior to the 2009 structural changes to local government in England it was part of Tynedale Council.

== Landmarks ==
Langley Castle is a restored medieval tower house, and a Grade I listed building. It was built in the middle of the 14th century as a great H-shaped tower of four storeys. Before this the site was the seat of the Barons of Tynedale in the 12th century, from whom descend the Tyndall family. It was attacked and severely damaged in 1405 by the forces of Henry IV in the campaign against the Percys and Archbishop Scrope. It remained as a ruin until it was bought and restored by a local historian, Cadwallader Bates, in the late 19th century. He died in 1902 and his wife Josephine continued the restoration. After she died in 1932 the building remained empty until it was used as a barracks in the Second World War, following which it was used as a girls&#x27; school. Inside Langley Castle are some of the best preserved Garderobes in Britain and these can be viewed from the main staircase. It has since been converted into a luxury hotel.

Staward Manor has an old Roman altar stone and, in 1999, a Roman road was discovered nearby.

Staward Gorge is a Victorian garden in a gorge of the River Allen. There are the remains of a medieval Pele tower. It is an area of Special Scientific Interest and the most northerly habitat of dormice in Britain, and while walking in the National Trust-owned Allen Banks and surrounding area, visitors may encounter deer and red squirrels.

<doc id="1196238" wikidata="Q43374" url="?curid=1196238" title="Dunollie Castle">
<text>Dunollie Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Dhùn Ollaigh) is a small ruined castle located on a hill north of the town of Oban, on the west coast of Scotland in Argyll and Bute. The site enjoys views over towards the island of Kerrera and a view of the town, harbour, and outlying isles. The castle is open to the public as part of the Dunollie Museum, Castle and Grounds.

==History==

There was a fortification on this high promontory in the early Middle Ages, when Dunollie was the royal centre of the Cenél Loairn within the kingdom of Dál Riata. The Irish annals record that &quot;Dun Ollaigh&quot; was attacked or burned down three times, in 686, 698, and in 701. It was subsequently rebuilt in 714 by Selbach mac Ferchair (died 730), the King of Dál Riata credited with destroying the site in 701. Excavations in the 1970s suggest that this early fortification was abandoned some time in the 10th century.

The area around Dunollie subsequently became part of the semi-independent Kingdom of the Isles, ruled over by Somerled in the 12th century. On his death the MacDougalls became Lords of Lorne. Dougall, Somerled&#x27;s son, held most of Argyll and also the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and many others in the 12th century.

Excavations show that Dunollie was refortified with an earthwork castle in the 13th century or potentially the late 12th century. The builder may have been Dougall, or his son Duncan. Ewan MacDougall, great-grandson of Somerled and the third chief of the MacDougalls, switched the clan&#x27;s allegiance in the mid 13th century: initially allied with Haakon IV of Norway, from the 1250s Ewan remained loyal to the kings of Scotland.

In the 14th century Ewan&#x27;s grandson John MacDougall, along with his kinsmen the Comyns, sided with the Balliols against the interests of Robert the Bruce. John MacDougall&#x27;s army defeated the Bruce at the Battle of Dalrigh in 1306, but Bruce returned in 1308 and crushed the MacDougalls at the Battle of the Pass of Brander. The MacDougall lands of Lorne were subsequently forfeit and were given to the Campbells, though Dunollie and other estates were regained later in the 14th century.

The existing castle ruins date largely from the 15th century.

The Marquis of Argyll captured the castle in 1644, but it was returned to the MacDougalls in 1661. In 1746, the MacDougalls abandoned Dunollie Castle and built Dunollie House just downhill from the castle ruins.

In recent years, a charitable trust was formed titled The MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust, who are responsible for the care of the historic buildings and collections held in this an ancestral site. Today, the Dunollie Preservation Trust operates Dunollie Museum, Castle &amp; Grounds - a visitor attractions and social enterprise. Through the running of this organisation, all funds raised contribute to ongoing conservation and development efforts as well as education and learning. Remains of a historical herb garden have recently been discovered in the castle grounds.

<doc id="1196245" wikidata="Q435936" url="?curid=1196245" title="Terentia">
<text>Terentia (; 98 BC – AD 6) was the wife of the orator Marcus Tullius Cicero. She was instrumental in Cicero&#x27;s political life both as a benefactor and as a fervent activist for his cause.

==Family background==

Terentia was born into a wealthy plebeian family by the name of Terentius. She may have been a daughter of the Terentii Varrones, who were the most important senatorial branch of that family. This is suggested by the fact that Cicero had a cousin with the cognomen Varro and a friend by the name of Marcus Terentius Varro. This Varro owned a house near Arpinum not far from Cicero&#x27;s own birthplace. Therefore, if Terentia was indeed the daughter of a Varro, Cicero&#x27;s links to this family may have influenced his marriage to Terentia.

Terentia had one half-sister named Fabia, who was a Vestal Virgin and the daughter of a patrician named Fabius. If Terentia&#x27;s mother married the plebeian Terentius first, then Terentia was the older sister and probably the sole inheritor of her father&#x27;s estate. Upon her father&#x27;s death, Terentia became very wealthy.

She was endowed with a huge dowry, which included at least two blocks of tenement apartments in Rome, a plot of woods in the suburbs of Rome, and a large farm. The apartments and farm generated a considerable annual income. There is evidence that Terentia had much land in her own name. In addition to the public land she possessed, Terentia acquired a large woodland property among many other investments. She also owned a village which she intended to sell in the crisis of Cicero&#x27;s exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;s:Letters to friends/14.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her total dowry was 400,000 sesterces, which was the exact amount needed for a man to run for senator. Since Cicero was still under the authority of his father, the &quot;paterfamilias&quot;, he had not yet inherited anything. Therefore, Terentia&#x27;s dowry was probably used to finance his political career.

==Marriage, family life, and children==

Terentia was around 18 years old when she married Cicero in 80 or 79 BC. Besides the connections between Cicero and the Terentii, Terentia probably married him because Cicero was an up-and-coming &quot;novus homo&quot; (new man) with a promising political career. She married Cicero in a &quot;sine manu&quot; marriage (see manus marriage), bringing with her the dowry and her private property. While the dowry passed into the control of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;paterfamilias&quot; and later to Cicero himself, Terentia herself conducted the affairs of her private property with the aid of her guardian Philotimus.

Terentia was responsible for conducting family affairs as well. Besides assigning slaves to complete tasks such as weaving and cooking, Terentia was serious about making offerings to the gods and demonstrating proper piety. Cicero refers to her regular worship in several correspondences; in one letter he describes her piety as an act of pure devotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;s:Letters to friends/14.4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In another, Cicero jokes that Terentia should sacrifice to the god that made him ill enough to expel his anxiety. Cicero&#x27;s jest indicates that he left much of these household responsibilities in the hands of his wife. She was also involved in supporting important relations with Cicero&#x27;s friends and family. In 68, Cicero and Terentia invited Cicero&#x27;s brother Quintus Tullius Cicero and his new wife Pomponia (a sister to Cicero&#x27;s friend Atticus) in order to improve and solidify the marriage. In a letter of that time, Cicero writes that Terentia is just as devoted to Atticus and his family as Cicero is.

Tullia, the daughter of Terentia and Cicero, was born in 78 BC. Since at this time they had already been married for two years without children, it is likely that the couple was not very fertile. Their son Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor was not born until 65 BC. Lack of fertility is also suggested by the fact that Tullia herself had problems conceiving children later in life.

In 51, when Cicero departed for his proconsulship in Cilicia, Tullia was unmarried and in need of a third husband. Since Cicero could not make a match for her except through letters, Terentia was instrumental in finding a suitable husband for Tullia. Cicero himself writes that he allowed the pair to make the decision without his further approval. Therefore, Cicero must have given his consent for a marriage in advance, for a Roman citizen could not get married without the approval of the &quot;paterfamilias&quot;. Terentia was also responsible for paying Publius Cornelius Dolabella the second installment of Tullia&#x27;s dowry in 48 BC, when Cicero was having financial trouble.

Since Cicero was a Pompeian and Dolabella a Caesarian, any decisive news of the civil war meant that the situation was getting worse for one of them. Terentia and Tullia had a strong relationship that helped them persevere through the tumultuous time of the civil war.

==Cicero&#x27;s exile and family crisis==
In 58 BC, Cicero was exiled from Rome for the allegedly illegal execution of Roman citizens in the Catiline conspiracy. Publius Clodius Pulcher enacted the bill with the purpose of getting revenge on Cicero for the fact that he had nullified Clodius&#x27; alibi in the Bona Dea affair. Plutarch, in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, tells us that Cicero was compelled to testify against Clodius by Terentia, in order to prove that he was not having an affair with Clodia (Clodius&#x27; sister). However, this story is most likely conceived either by Plutarch himself or a slanderer of Cicero. Plutarch&#x27;s intentions were to show Terentia as an oppressive wife and thus to show Cicero as a weak man under the control of his wife.

Upon his exile, Cicero left his estate in chaos. Terentia was thus left in charge of the affairs concerning Cicero&#x27;s houses, villas, revenues, and his slaves. The responsibility of Cicero Minor&#x27;s upbringing, the welfare of the household, and the safety of Tullia also fell to Terentia. She continued to act as a wife to Cicero even though his exile legally ended their marriage.

Both Tullia and Terentia protested the exile publicly. They wore their hair unkempt and put on black mourning clothes. In this fashion they visited the houses of their friends in Rome in order to gain sympathy and support for Cicero&#x27;s return. After Cicero&#x27;s house on the Palatine Hill was burned down by Clodius&#x27; mob, Terentia took refuge in the house of the Vestal Virgins. Although she may have also stayed at the home of Tullia&#x27;s husband Piso, it is likely that Terentia spent the entire duration of Cicero&#x27;s exile living with Fabia and the Vestals.

During this time, Cicero himself was depressed and at times suicidal. He writes that he is wretched and that he should no longer live. He asks frequently what he should do and despairs that he cannot ask Terentia to come to him for she is an exhausted woman; meanwhile, Terentia was very busy with her efforts to arrange Cicero&#x27;s return to Rome.

In an earlier letter, Cicero commends Terentia&#x27;s relentless courage and fortitude. He says that he has heard how active Terentia is from many of his friends. This indicates that Terentia was able to rally widespread support on behalf of Cicero. Furthermore, Cicero reassures Terentia that he has given proper thanks to those who she has told him to recognize because they have helped her. This shows that Terentia was not only keeping Cicero up to date on her progress, but she was also delegating him a role to play in the whole effort. Cicero admits that the hope of his return depends on Terentia and so he worries for her health and ability to take on her many labours.&lt;ref name=&quot;s:Letters to friends/14.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Terentia did not reveal the worst details to Cicero, probably so as not to encourage his depression. He found out from P. Valerius that Terentia was dragged from the Temple of Vesta to the Valerian Bank. Terentia may have also suffered physical abuse in this incident, as indicated by Cicero&#x27;s later orations.

Thus, even though others such as Atticus, Tullia, Piso and Quintus were also lobbying for Cicero&#x27;s return, Terentia was one of the most fervent activists in the crisis. Cicero was able to return to Rome in 57 BC.

==Civil war and divorce==

At the beginning of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompeius Magnus in 49 BC, both Terentia and Tullia remained at the Palatine house (which was already rebuilt). Tullia was pregnant at the time and she stayed with her mother because her third husband Dolabella had gone to join Caesar. It was up to Terentia and Tullia to decide whether or not they would remain in Rome during the war, even though Cicero worried about their safety.

During the remainder of 49 and much of 48 BC, Terentia was once again responsible for managing the family&#x27;s finances. However, now Cicero was displeased with the way she was handling things and he was especially critical of Philotimus&#x27; work. In , Plutarch tells us that Terentia was at fault for the lack of funds that Cicero required to pay for his journey. Although Plutarch was hostile to the record of Terentia, his account supports a letter by Cicero in which he may be blaming Terentia - someone &quot;he has trusted too much&quot;.

Their time apart and the strained atmosphere of the civil war caused the letters of Terentia and Cicero to become increasingly emotionless and reserved. While Cicero was staying in Brundisium, he often found time to write Terentia. However, his letters were terse and ineloquent, which was unlike most letters between the two. The pair had further disagreement over Terentia&#x27;s will in 47 BC, specifically about what should be left to their children. At the same time, Tullia&#x27;s marriage to Dolabella was going badly as his infidelity and neglect of her became more prominent. Cicero avoids blaming Terentia for making the match in the first place (despite Cicero&#x27;s misgivings at the time), but it is clear that he wishes the decision had been made differently. Despite the lack of affectionate feelings and the growing resentment and suspicion of Terentia, Cicero continued to trust her with the administration of their household.

The strain on their marriage led to divorce in 47 or 46 BC. Terentia was around 52 years old at the time. According to Hieronymus Stridonensis, Terentia later remarried two times, her second husband being the historian Sallust and her third the writer and general Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus. But Hieronymus lived much later, in the fourth century AD, and his assertions are not confirmed by any other ancient writer. Prominent scholars of Roman prosopography such as Ronald Syme refute the possibility of those two marriages (for instance, both actual wives of Messala Corvinus are known). She outlived her ex-husband by many years, dying at the age of 103 in 6 AD. Susan Treggiari has pointed out that the later historian may have confused Terentia with Cicero&#x27;s second wife Publilia.

<doc id="1196247" wikidata="Q535381" url="?curid=1196247" title="Palladium Books">
<text>Palladium Books is a publisher of role-playing games (RPGs) best known for its &quot;Rifts&quot; series (1990–present). Palladium was founded April 1981 in Detroit, Michigan, by current president and lead game designer Kevin Siembieda, and is now based in Westland, Michigan. The company enjoys the support of a small but dedicated fanbase who praise its various game series for their innovative settings and ease of adaptability to various personal preferences, play styles, and power levels.

==History==
The first game released by Palladium Books was &quot;The Mechanoid Invasion&quot; in 1981, followed by the first-editions of &quot;The Palladium Role-Playing Game&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Heroes Unlimited&quot; in 1984, with &quot;The Valley of the Pharaohs&quot; released between the two.

Other popular titles include adaptations of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1985) and &quot;Robotech&quot; (1986). Palladium was also one of the major distributors of &quot;Robotech&quot; merchandise for several years. Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, all of Palladium&#x27;s licenses lapsed and were not pursued for renewal. In September 2007, Palladium finalized negotiations with Harmony Gold USA to produce &quot;&quot;, an RPG based on &quot;&quot;. This license was discontinued in 2018.

Palladium claims that it was the first publisher in the RPG industry to adopt the practice of perfect binding its books, a move that has since been emulated by many other companies. Palladium also releases most of its titles in paperback, whereas other major RPG publishers mostly publish hardback editions. This format choice has allowed Palladium to provide full sourcebooks at a lower cost than many other game lines.

Although Palladium did not establish the use of universal game mechanics, it was one of the first companies to successfully create role-playing games in multiple genres; for this reason, its house system may be described as &quot;Megaversal&quot; – &quot;not universal, but more than just one world&quot;.

===Licensing===
Palladium has licensed several of their intellectual properties to third-party developers.

The first book ever published by another company under license from Palladium was &quot;Rifts: Manhunter&quot; from Myrmidon Press, released December 1994. Palladium cancelled the license in May 1996.

In October 2000, &quot;Rifts&quot; was licensed to the now defunct Precedence Entertainment for a collectible card game. In May 2004, &quot;Rifts&quot; was licensed to create the &quot;&quot; video game for the failed Nokia N-Gage gaming platform.

In May 2003, Palladium announced that Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Walt Disney Pictures had optioned the rights to make a film based on &quot;Rifts&quot;. At the time, Bruckheimer was said to be developing the movie in conjunction with screenwriter David Franzoni. An April 19, 2006, press release asserted that &quot;until Jerry Bruckheimer has a script he loves, the movie can&#x27;t get the green light.&quot; In the April 14, 2011, weekly update, Siembieda said that the film option would be renewed for a ninth year.

In 2015, Palladium entered into an agreement with Pinnacle Entertainment Group to publish &quot;Rifts&quot; material under the &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; game system. Multiple books, maps, and other supplements for &quot;Savage Worlds: Rifts&quot; have been released in the years since.

===Embezzlement case and financial difficulties===
On April 19, 2006, Siembieda issued a statement that revealed Palladium&#x27;s critical financial difficulties due to alleged embezzlement and theft resulting in losses from $850,000 to $1.3 million, coupled with a series of delays in negotiating license deals for their properties in other media (the Nokia N-Gage game, the Jerry Bruckheimer movie, a massively multiplayer online game license, and other potential deals). They raised money to continue operations by selling a signed and numbered – but not, strictly speaking, &quot;limited edition&quot; – art print by Siembieda, as well as by urging fans to buy directly from their online store if their financial situations would allow for it.

An April 26, 2006, article in the &quot;Kingsport Times-News&quot; revealed that Steve Sheiring, Palladium&#x27;s former sales manager, had been sentenced in a plea bargain to a misdemeanor conviction, one year of probation, and ordered to pay $47,080 in restitution to Palladium Books in connection with these thefts. It also provided more information about the thefts, which took place from 2002 to 2004, and were only discovered when Palladium took inventory.

== Criticisms ==
Palladium is entirely controlled and owned by Siembieda. Some writers who have been published by Palladium have stated that Siembieda&#x27;s method of management was too centralized and not adapted to the size the company had reached (no delegation of responsibilities, lack of open dialogue with employees, bad interpersonal relationships), which they cited as a reason they were no longer working for the company. One of the writers later apologized for the manner in which he made his statements, but did not retract his claims.

=== &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; ===
Palladium and Siembieda continue to receive criticism regarding the handling of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; after a successful Kickstarter campaign raising $1,442,312 from 5,342 backers, ending on May 20, 2013. During the campaign, Palladium specified an intended release date of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; as early as 2013 Holiday Season. Shortly before expected release, Palladium shifted the projection to Spring/Summer of 2014; later the date was shifted again, to late Summer/Autumn 2014, with international backers several months after. Siembieda and Palladium attributed these shifting dates to a number of unforeseen issues including Chinese New Year causing production to start later than expected.

On September 25, 2013, Update #113 echoed the intention of a holiday release and promised Kickstarter backers receipt of product prior to retail distribution. This was followed by an update in November 2013 listing several unforeseen issues holding up production and further delay. On September 8, 2014, several Kickstarter backers indicated receipt of their copies of the game, while the remainder of rewards were awaiting delivery from China via cargo ship. There were six cargo ships containing backer rewards, as indicated in Update #156 to Kickstarter backers. This same update also provided some clarification on delivery schedules and outlined Palladium&#x27;s &#x27;two wave&#x27; product release schedule designed to offset additional delay in providing promised products. Some backers perceived the update implied the second wave of items were nearing production. Citing no specific dates however, Palladium estimated mid to late October 2014 as the general time Kickstarter rewards would be available for delivery to backers.

On July 14, 2014, Palladium issued a plea to backers seeking permission to sell any available copies of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; to attendees of Gen Con 2014, a perceived divergence from an earlier promise to make copies unavailable to the public until backer rewards were fully delivered. Siembieda wrote:

Ultimately, Palladium proceeded with the sale despite disputes over the results of the survey. Several days before Gen Con, Palladium received word the shipping containers containing &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; had been tagged for inspection by US Customs, subsequently blocking any opportunity to take the game to Gen Con and further delaying shipment to backers, projected at the time to arrive in early to mid-September 2014 for US residents.

International backers had not received their backer rewards prior to April 2015, nor had report of backer rewards shipping outside of the US been made by Palladium, despite reports of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; boxed-sets appearing in shops outside the United States. International backers began receiving items mid April 2015.

At Gen Con 2014, an attendee received one unopened core box game used for display at Gen Con and recorded an unboxing video of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; to allow backers to see the final production quality. Subsequently, many fans expressed concern over several production oversights and issues. Notably, included game pieces were missing paint, paper materials used to play the game were missing altogether from all units shipped, game pieces contained manufacturing errors such as injection mold seams and pitted surfaces, and assembly instructions were vague or inaccurate with context to materials shown to backers throughout the Kickstarter campaign.

In Update #154 to Kickstarter backers, Palladium issued a brief apology to backers and fans, &quot;Oh, and we only recently realized that the plastic blast template is not painted, and it is too late to do anything about it now. This detail slipped past all of us – Palladium, Ninja Division, the factory, everyone. Sorry. It still looks great, is a quality piece of plastic and is easy to use.&quot;

Printed materials missing from initial backer rewards were later released in low resolution watermarked PDF format on the website DriveThru RPG for backers to print copies along with updated assembly instructions to all game pieces requiring assembly, free of charge.

In September 2015, several backers openly discussed filing a complaint with the Attorney General and Better Business Bureau in Michigan, with claims of filing becoming more public in December 2015 during speculative discussions from Siembieda&#x27;s comments regarding the game.

Palladium made few statements regarding &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; through 2015, particularly regarding specific release dates. However, in January 2016, Siembieda released a statement on the Kickstarter project page remaining silent regarding the second portion of backer rewards:

...As I have stated, for strategic and business reasons we have been unable to share with you everything Palladium has been exploring, considering and working on. As you know, one of the things we have been doing is looking into and considering possible ways to reduce part counts and make the game pieces easier to put together. As we get into actual production and manufacturing for Wave Two this year, we will share plenty with you. And we think you&#x27;ll be pleased. Considering all the delays and frustration of the past, we do not want to even speculate on release dates and other details until we have hard, solid information we are confident with ourselves.

As of February 2016, only 176 backers of over 5000 had claimed receipt of their full backer rewards, and more than 1000 days had passed since the initial Kickstarter project ended. The Better Business Bureau had 14 complaints directed toward Palladium Books between July 2014 and February 2016.

On February 27, 2018, Siembieda announced that they were unable to fulfill the Wave 2 rewards, and that due to the end of the Robotech license, Palladium Books would no longer try to produce and support &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; after March 31, 2018, although the game was still announced at Adepticon and Anime North, both events happening after the end of license. Furthermore, Siembieda claimed that the production of Wave 1 items had cost $1.5 million and so Palladium was not able to produce Wave 2 since 2015, at which time, Wave 1 was shipping. As way to liquidate the overstock of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; products before the license ended, Palladium offered a rewards swap process with arbitrary valuation heavily in favor of Palladium Books. They also required that Backers who wished to receive Wave 1 items in lieu of Wave 2 pay the shipping to their location in advance as well as renouncing any and all legal claims against Palladium Books. The manner the project and mostly its end has been criticized by backers and heavily voiced on multiple platforms. Some questioned the handling of the funds, to which Palladium Books responded with a pie chart missing a certain number of pertinent information (% tax paid, % of funds received as part of the BackerKit in September 2013...)

A certain number of backers requested cash refunds as per the Terms of Services signed by Palladium at the time of the launch and their position in 2014. As of today, Palladium has yet to respond to questions regarding the usage of the funds and the refund due as stated by Siembieda and his staff as well as the Kickstarter Terms of Service.

=== Loss of the &quot;Robotech&quot; license ===

On February 27, 2018, Palladium Books announced they had lost the Robotech IP as it was not renewed by Harmony Gold, the current IP owner. Palladium had announced that &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics Wave Two&quot; kickstarter had been canceled.

Siembieda went on to announce on their kickstarter page:

So it is with sadness and tremendous heartbreak that I announce that, despite our best efforts, we are unable to produce the &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics Wave Two&quot; rewards. Moreover, after proudly carrying the legacy of Robotech in the role-playing games medium for 30 years, our license has expired and is not being renewed.

...As part of our license agreement, Palladium has a short window (from now until the end of March) to liquidate our stock of &quot;Robotech RPG Tactics&quot; (RRT) products, &quot;Robotech Shadow Chronicles&quot; Role-Playing Game books, and the PDFs of the original &quot;Robotech RPG&quot; series currently available

Palladium&#x27;s &quot;Robotech&quot; license ended on March 31, 2018.

=== Conversions ===
Palladium is aggressive in preventing wide distribution of fan-made conversions of their games to other systems (such as the D20 System), and also strongly discourages converting the intellectual property of others into their system; while they cannot prevent it, doing so is not allowed in venues owned by Palladium Books. Palladium also routinely threatens legal action against fans who distribute conversions in other venues by issuance of cease and desist orders. When asked why Palladium was so much stricter in regard to conversions than other game companies, Siembieda stated that the policy had been adopted due to advice from Palladium&#x27;s lawyers, to shield Palladium from liability for conversions of other parties&#x27; intellectual property. The sole exception to this policy is the licensing agreement held with Pinnacle Entertainment Group for conversion of the &quot;Rifts&quot; line to the &quot;Savage Worlds&quot; system.

== Game lines ==
:&quot;The Rifter&quot; is a magazine published for all lines.
* &quot;After the Bomb&quot;, a post-apocalyptic RPG that began as an alternative campaign setting for &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness&quot;, but soon developed into its own series. In it, mutant animals struggle for survival, often against human supremacist nations.
* &quot;Beyond the Supernatural&quot;, a modern horror RPG along the lines of &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. An incomplete second edition core rulebook was released in January 2005, with more information about the world, which is assumed to be similar to the real world, but with supernatural happenings which no one notices.

* &quot;Systems Failure&quot; is a post-apocalyptic game in which the Y2K bug heralded the collapse of the power and telecommunications grids with the arrival of extra dimensional energy &quot;bugs&quot;.
* &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness&quot; was based on the original comic books. However, due to waning sales (blamed on the childish nature of the original television cartoon), the license was not renewed when it expired in 2000.

* &quot;Valley of the Pharaohs&quot; is an historical RPG set in Ancient Egypt.

==&quot;Weapons&quot;==
&quot;Weapons&quot; is a 1981 fantasy role-playing game supplement published by Turtle Press.

===Contents===
&quot;Weapons&quot; is a compendium of virtually every edged or impact melee weapon used in any medieval or primitive culture. &quot;Weapons&quot; is an indexed sourcebook describing hundreds of different melee weapons, each illustrated. Weapons are covered in six sections: Swords, Knives, Hafted Weapons, Spears, Pole Arms, and Miscellaneous.

===Publication history===
&quot;Weapons&quot; was written by Matthew Balent and published in 1981 by Turtle Press, and was later revised and included in &quot;The Compendium of Weapons, Armour &amp; Castles&quot;.

Matthew Balent was one of a few future Palladium writers who Siembieda met through the Detroit Gaming Center. At the time, Balent was working on a reference book that could be used in fantasy roleplaying games. Balent was a Library Sciences graduate, and had the skill and knowledge required to pick through hundreds of books to create a general overview of medieval armor and armaments. &quot;The Palladium Book of Weapons &amp; Armor&quot; (1981) was the first of several books Balent compiled for Palladium. Balent also compiled &quot;The Palladium Book of Weapons &amp; Castles&quot; in 1982. He also worked on &quot;The Palladium Book of Weapons and Castles of the Orient&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Palladium Book of European Castles&quot; (1985).

===Reception===
Lewis Pulsipher reviewed &quot;Weapons&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 43. Pulsipher commented that &quot;In my view there is no need to add weapons to those already in most FRPG; but if you must, you&#x27;ll need to look them up in a good source to get some detail. Ten times as much information about a tenth as many weapons, presented more professionally, would have been much more useful. In short, &quot;Weapons&quot; is virtually useless.&quot;

<doc id="1196250" wikidata="Q940483" url="?curid=1196250" title="Triangular orthobicupola">
<text>In geometry, the triangular orthobicupola is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by attaching two triangular cupolas () along their bases. It has an equal number of squares and triangles at each vertex; however, it is not vertex-transitive. It is also called an &quot;anticuboctahedron&quot;, &quot;twisted cuboctahedron&quot; or &quot;disheptahedron&quot;. It is also a canonical polyhedron.

The &quot;triangular orthobicupola&quot; is the first in an infinite set of orthobicupolae.

== Construction ==
The &quot;triangular orthobicupola&quot; can be constructed by attaching two triangular cupolas onto their bases. Similar to the cuboctahedron, which would be known as the &quot;triangular gyrobicupola&quot;, the difference is that the two triangular cupolas that make up the triangular orthobicupola are joined so that pairs of matching sides abut (hence, &quot;ortho&quot;); the cuboctahedron is joined so that triangles abut squares and vice versa. Given a triangular orthobicupola, a 60-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a cuboctahedron. Hence, another name for the triangular orthobicupola is the &quot;anticuboctahedron&quot;. Because the triangular orthobicupola has the property of convexity and its faces are regular polygons—eight equilateral triangles and six squares—it is categorized as a Johnson solid. It is enumerated as the twenty-seventh Johnson solid formula_1

== Properties ==
The surface area formula_2 and the volume formula_3 of a triangular orthobicupola are the same as those with cuboctahedron. Its surface area can be obtained by summing all of its polygonal faces, and its volume is by slicing it off into two triangular cupolas and adding their volume. With edge length formula_4, they are:
formula_5

The dual polyhedron of a triangular orthobicupola is the trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron. It has 6 rhombic and 6 trapezoidal faces, and is similar to the rhombic dodecahedron.

<text>J.H. Whittaker &amp; Sons, Ltd (Whittaker&#x27;s) is a New Zealand confectionery manufacturer specialising in palm oil-free chocolate, based in Porirua. Whittaker&#x27;s is the largest chocolate brand in New Zealand. Approximately 30% of their production is now exported. The company controls its entire manufacturing process in its facility in Porirua, identifying itself as a &quot;bean-to-bar&quot; manufacturer. James Henry Whittaker (1868–1947) started the business in Christchurch in 1896 and it was later moved to Wellington.

==History==
James Henry Whittaker (1868–1947) worked in the British confectionery industry from the age of 14 and moved to New Zealand with his wife Leah Alice in 1890. He was a salesman for Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate before and after his move to New Zealand. In 1896 he started manufacturing chocolate confectionery, selling it directly to customers using a horse and van. In 1913, he established a partnership with his two sons, Ronald and James, based in Wellington. The business became a limited liability company in 1937, with third-generation Whittakers still the sole shareholders in the company. In 1969 the company moved from Wellington to Porirua, because they needed more space and their premises at 167 Vivian Street were under threat from motorway development. The Peanut Slab was invented in the 1950s and Whittaker&#x27;s began exporting it in 1985. In the 1970s and 80s they also produced Santé Bars, Toffee Milk Bars and K-Bars. The company began producing large blocks of chocolate in the 1990s. In 1992 the company formed J. H. Whittaker New Zealand Ltd.

The company has provided commercial sponsorship for motor sports in New Zealand and for the All Blacks.

The company&#x27;s marketing phrases include &quot;A passion for chocolate since 1896&quot; and &quot;Good honest chocolate&quot; and also &quot;from bean to bar&quot;. In 2011 it was listed as New Zealand&#x27;s third most trusted brand by a Bradley Colman survey. From 2012 to 2023 Whittaker&#x27;s was voted New Zealand&#x27;s most trusted brand, benefitting from Cadbury&#x27;s 2009 bad publicity surrounding palm oil and changes in product size, and further fallout from Cadbury&#x27;s closure of its Dunedin factory in 2017. In 2023, Whittaker&#x27;s also won &#x27;Most Trusted Confectionary&#x27; and &#x27;Most Trusted New Zealand Iconic Brand&#x27;. Organisers of the 2023 survey stated that Whittaker&#x27;s success stemmed from its engagement with its customers, integrating their ideas into the business. Whittaker&#x27;s was also transparent about aspects of their products, including price changes, which helped build trust with consumers.

In May 2014, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson filmed an advert for Whittaker&#x27;s in the 1930s Wellington railway station. Later, in 2022, Karl Urban appeared in an advert as a fictionalised time-travelling James Whittaker, appearing in Wellington&#x27;s Civic Square.

In June 2014, Whittaker&#x27;s expanded its market to Malaysia.

In 2014 Whittaker&#x27;s set up a programme to support and improve cocoa bean production in Samoa, and in 2017 expanded the programme to include New Zealand&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In 2019 Whittaker&#x27;s admitted that while some bars have ethically-sourced cocoa beans, the sugar is primarily sourced from Thailand. Thailand is known to have child labour in the sugar cane industry. In 2020 Whittaker&#x27;s announced that its 116 products made with Ghanaian cocoa beans would now be &#x27;Rainforest Alliance Certified&#x27;. The company also uses small amounts of beans from Samoa and Nicaragua. 

Apart from being named as New Zealand&#x27;s most trusted brand, the company has won other awards including &#x27;Exporter of the Year&#x27; at the 2021 ExportNZ ASB Wellington Export Awards and Supreme Award in the 2022 Wellington Gold Awards, which are awarded to recognise businesses in the Wellington region.

In 2020, Whittaker&#x27;s produced a limited-release Māori language label for its &#x27;Creamy Milk&#x27; chocolate block for social media engagement purposes. In August 2022 the company distributed chocolate with a Māori label nationwide for Māori Language Week. The label had the chocolate variety &#x27;Creamy Milk&#x27; written in Māori as &#x27;Miraka Kirīmi&#x27;. The initiative was met with both praise and hostility from the public. In 2024 Whittaker&#x27;s announced that it would no longer produce the Māori label, but would be supporting Māori Language Week in other ways.

Singer Ed Sheeran visited New Zealand in February 2023 and said via Instagram that he liked New Zealand chocolate. Whittaker&#x27;s responded by sending Sheeran a block of Creamy Milk with Sheeran&#x27;s face on the label, calling it the &#x27;Ed Block&#x27;. Whittaker&#x27;s then teamed up with Sheeran to auction signed T-shirts and a supply of chocolate to raise funds for victims of the 2023 Auckland Anniversary Weekend floods.

In March 2024 Whittaker&#x27;s announced the discontinuation of Toffee Milks.

<doc id="1196263" wikidata="Q15515916" url="?curid=1196263" title="Waite Phillips">
<text>Waite Phillips (January 19, 1883 – January 27, 1964) was an American petroleum businessman who created a fully integrated operation that combined petroleum producing, refining and marketing. With headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he also developed several office complexes and engaged in banking and ranching. Phillips was a philanthropist for both local Tulsa institutions and national causes. In Tulsa he built a 72-room mansion for his residence, which he later donated to the city; it became the Philbrook Museum of Art. He gave of his favorite ranch in New Mexico to the Boy Scouts of America, together with an office building as part of its endowment. The ranch is now Philmont Scout Ranch, one of the largest youth camps in the world. Phillips also made a substantial bequest to the University of Southern California, which named a building after him.

==Early life and education==
Waite Phillips and his identical twin brother Wiate were born near Conway, Iowa to Civil War veteran Lewis &quot;Lew&quot; Franklin Phillips and Lucinda Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; Faucett Phillips. Waite, the younger twin, was the seventh of ten children born into the Phillips family.

In 1899, at age 16, Waite and Wiate left the farm they called home, boarded a train and headed west. Their travels took them to most of the western and midwestern United States and parts of Canada. To support themselves, they worked a variety of jobs in fields such as railroad building, mining and lumbering, and spent one winter trapping fur animals in the Bitterroot Mountains. Their adventure came to an end in Spokane, Washington on July 16, 1902, when Wiate died as a result of acute appendicitis.

==Career==
Waite returned home to Iowa and, after six months of college studies, launched into an active business career. Under the guidance and help of his elder brothers, Frank and L. E. Phillips, he moved from a short period of coal mining in Iowa to petroleum operations in 1906, centered on Bartlesville, Oklahoma. His brothers created the business which became known as Phillips Petroleum Company.

In 1914, Phillips sold his oil interests to his elder brothers. He started out on his own as an individual oil producer, refiner and marketer. His fully integrated and extensive oil operations lasted almost 40 years. After 1918, he had his headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While in Tulsa, Phillips built several office complexes, such as the Philtower and Philcade Buildings. He also had a mansion built, the 72-room Italian Renaissance-style Villa Philbrook. In 1938 during the Great Depression, Phillips donated his immense home to the city of Tulsa, which adapted it into the Philbrook Museum of Art. Each of these buildings has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After donating the mansion to the city, Phillips and his wife Genevieve moved into a 23-room penthouse residence that he had added to the Philcade in 1937. That became their primary residence in Tulsa until Waite sold the building in 1942.

In addition to his oil business, Phillips was actively engaged in banking, city real estate developments and the operation of ranches in several Rocky Mountain regions. His first choice of ranches were lands in the western foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains near Cimarron, New Mexico, acquired in 1922. After disposing of his other ranches, he developed the UU Ranch into diversified farming and livestock operations. Waite built the Villa Philmonte as his summer house. On the ranch, he also built mountain trails, a hunting lodge and a fishing lodge, all of which he found to be restful retreats from business pressures in Tulsa.

==Philanthropy==
Phillips sometimes allowed others to visit his ranch, including a few Boy Scout troops. In 1938 and in 1941, Phillips donated of his Ranch to the Boy Scouts of America, complete with water, mineral and timber rights. The only condition was that it be used &quot;for the benefit of the members of the Boy Scout organization&quot; and the second larger donation had only the condition that it pay its fair share of taxes on any portion devoted to competitive commercial operations. As an endowment, he donated the 23-story Philtower Building in Tulsa. These donations were made without any rights of management reserved by the donor. All equipment and livestock was included in the gift with the idea that diversified ranch operations would provide educational benefits to Boy Scouts and would add to the endowment income. In honor of Phillips, the Boy Scouts of America renamed the newly donated land Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp. Later the property was renamed Philmont Scout Ranch. His son Chope visited frequently, until his passing in 2015 at age 97.

Phillips died in 1964 and a primary beneficiary of his estate was the University of Southern California. USC built a 12-story building, named the &quot;Waite Phillips Hall&quot;, which was dedicated in 1968.

In 1943, Phillips was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.

==Marriage and family==
In 1909, he married Genevieve Elliott in Knoxville, Iowa. Waite and Genevieve had two children, Helen Jane (July 1, 1911 – May 19, 1963; age 52) and Elliott &quot;Chope&quot; Waite (January 11, 1918 – April 26, 2015). Helen Jane married baseball player and attorney William R. Breckinridge.

Waite Phillips died on January 27, 1964, at age 81. Waite and Genevieve Phillips are buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Grandfather Mountain is a mountain, a non-profit attraction, and a North Carolina state park
near Linville, North Carolina. At 5,946 feet (1,812 m), it is the highest peak on the eastern escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains, one of the major chains of the Appalachian Mountains. (Nearby Mt. Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River, is on the western escarpment.) The Blue Ridge Parkway passes by the south side of the mountain and also passes over the nearby Grandmother Gap. It is located at the meeting point of Avery, Caldwell (highest point), and Watauga (highest point) counties.

==Era of private ownership==
Until 2008, Grandfather Mountain was privately owned and operated as a nature preserve and tourist attraction. It was and still is best known for its mile-high swinging bridge, the highest in America, built in 1952 by Hugh Morton. The bridge links two of the mountain&#x27;s rocky peaks, and is known as the &quot;swinging&quot; bridge due to its tendency to sway in high winds. Morton inherited the mountain from his grandfather and developed the tourist attractions. He died on June 1, 2006, at the age of 85. After Morton&#x27;s death, he donated all of his photographs, including many of Grandfather Mountain, Mildred the Bear, and many other aspects of life on the mountain to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Grandfather Mountain State Park==
On September 29, 2008, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley announced that the state had agreed to purchase of the undeveloped portions of Grandfather Mountain from the Morton family for $12 million. The area has been added to the North Carolina State Park system, becoming the 34th North Carolina state park. The Morton family established the Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation to continue to operate the travel destination as an educational nature park. Grandfather Mountain State Park was officially established in 2009. The &quot;backcountry&quot; portion of the mountain that comprises the state park is now regularly (in favorable weather) patrolled by state park rangers and other state law enforcement personnel.

As part of the purchase agreement, the state acquired part of the mountain commonly referred to as the &quot;backcountry&quot; in fee simple, and it also acquired a conservation easement and right of first refusal over the remaining &quot;attraction side&quot; of the mountain. In addition, the Morton family agreed to form a new non-profit organization and transfer ownership of the attraction to it. This arrangement was made as an alternative to the state acquiring the entire mountain, because some of the traditional activities at Grandfather Mountain conflict with state park management policies.

On September 18, 2011, the park had a grand opening celebration for its first office area, which is from the Profile Trail-head on NC 105.

==Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation==
The Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation is the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established by the Morton family in 2009 to operate the scenic travel attraction Grandfather Mountain in Linville, N.C.

The Foundation manages the roughly property that includes the Mile High Swinging Bridge, Nature Museum and Animal Habitats. All proceeds from sales of tickets and souvenirs go toward preserving Grandfather Mountain and sharing its wonders in ways that deepen visitors&#x27; appreciation of nature and inspire good stewardship of the Earth.

The mission statement of the Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation, adopted in 2014, is: &quot;Inspiring conservation of the natural world by helping guests explore, understand and value the wonders of Grandfather Mountain.&quot;

The Stewardship Foundation is managed by a seven-member Board of Directors, which in turn employs the leadership and staff of the Grandfather Mountain attraction.

==Physical features==
Grandfather Mountain rises above sea level, and due to the considerable elevation gain the mountain boasts 16 distinct ecological communities. The mountain is famous for its rugged character, and is home to many hidden caves and significant cliffs.

It has been reported that Grandfather Mountain has experienced some of the &quot;highest surface wind speeds ever recorded,&quot; with unverified speeds in excess of . More recently, Grandfather Mountain has upgraded their wind equipment in order to help resolve controversy over these high wind recordings. Notably however, the new equipment is located on the Swinging Bridge of the attraction. The new instruments may not record the highest wind speeds on the mountain, which extends another above the current location of the equipment.

The primary massif (ridge) of the mountain is oriented roughly north to south, and features four named peaks: Calloway Peak (5,964 ft.), Attic Window Peak (5,949 ft.), MacRae Peak (5,844 ft.), and Linville Peak (5,295 ft.). Although not as high as the adjacent Calloway and Attic Window Peaks, MacRae is much more difficult to reach due to difficult and exposed approaches from both the north and south.

Two rivers have headwaters on Grandfather Mountain, the Linville River, flowing east, and the Watauga River, flowing west. Many lesser streams originate on the slopes of Grandfather, including: Upper Boone Fork, Little Wilson Creek, Wilson Creek (North Carolina), Stack Rock Creek, and others.

On top of Grandfather Mountain, like many mountain peaks above 5000&#x27; in North Carolina, grows an &quot;island&quot; of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Though the forest was largely devastated during the 20th century by the introduction of the non-native balsam wooly adelgid, a remnant of this biome still exists on Grandfather Mountain. Many of these fir trees have been permanently bent by the high winds that often prevail from the west. In addition to fir trees, these &quot;mountaintop island&quot; biomes are a valuable and threatened habitat for many other flora and fauna suited to survival at higher elevation.


==Access==
The attraction side of the mountain, which includes the Mile High Swinging Bridge, is accessed via Grandfather Mountain Entrance Road. Admittance fees are charged at the main gate. Part or all of the attraction is sometimes closed due to frequently inclement weather in the late fall, winter, and spring.

Hiking and camping are free in the &quot;backcountry&quot; area now designated as a state park; the required permits are available at all trail heads. Those intending to enter or leave the park via the attraction must still pay admittance, however. In years previous when the whole mountain was privately owned, hikers and campers were required to pay fees. Park regulations are enforced by patrolling state park rangers. Fire is prohibited at many of the higher elevation campsites, due to high winds.

The 11 trails on the mountain vary in difficulty, from strolls through the woods to some of the most rugged and intense hiking found in the Eastern U.S.

The east side trails can be accessed at Boone Fork parking area, at milepost 300 of the Blue Ridge Parkway. When the parkway is closed in winter, this trailhead can still be accessed via the Asutsi trail, beginning at Serenity Farm on highway 221. The easiest east side route to Calloway Peak is to follow Tanawha Trail to the Daniel Boone Scout trail. This includes two large fixed ladders that traverse rock faces. Alternatively, a steeper but more scenic option is the Cragway trail, which is narrower and boulder strewn, but offers excellent views of the Boone Fork bowl, or &quot;medicine valley.&quot;

The west side trails are accessed via NC 105, north of the intersection with NC 184. There is a wooden sign with yellow lettering that reads &quot;Profile Parking.&quot; This references the Profile trail, which climbs steadily for before intersecting the Grandfather trail at a point south of Calloway Peak, and north of Attic Window Peak. It is named for the famous &quot;Profile View&quot; it passes, which is a rock feature resembling a human facial profile.

The Grandfather trail traverses the of ridgeline between Calloway Peak and the Swinging Bridge (Linville Peak), attaining Attic Window and MacRae Peaks along the way. This trail is among the most difficult and technical in the region. In addition to significant steep elevation gain and loss, trail conditions include frequent exposure to very high winds, contiguity to several large cliffs, crossings of cracked boulders, and multiple traverses aided by fixed ladders and cables. This is normally covered at below half of normal hiking pace. In favorable weather conditions this trail is considered advanced. In poor weather, (throughout the winter and much of spring), this trail should only be attempted by experienced, expert hikers, due to significant formation of ice sheets, accumulation of snow, frequent low visibility, and commonly sub-zero wind chill factors. Significantly, in the early months of 2011, the state park service closed trail access to MacRae peak, something very seldom if ever done under private ownership. The closure notice threatened violators with prosecution under a section of the NC General Statutes.

==Attractions==

One of North America&#x27;s largest Highland games events, the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games are held here each year, drawing in visitors from all over the world. The Highland Games celebrate the Scottish ancestry of many of the pioneers who settled around the mountain and feature traditional Scottish games and music. The Grandfather Mountain games have been called &quot;the best&quot; such event in the United States because of the spectacular highland setting (reminiscent of Scotland) and the great percentage of people who attend in kilts and other Scottish regalia. It is considered the largest &quot;gathering of clans&quot; because more different family lines are represented at this event than any other in North America.

A paved road leads to one of the mountain&#x27;s several peaks (Linville Peak), and there visitors will find a museum, the famous &quot;mile-high swinging bridge&quot;, and views of up to - on a clear day, it is possible to see the city skyline of Charlotte. The view also overlooks the Grandfather Mountain Golf and Country Club, which lies at the base of Grandfather Mountain. It has two 18-hole golf courses, one championship and one executive, each designed by Ellis Maples. The championship course is consistently ranked as the finest mountain course in the Carolinas.

On the road to the summit there are wildlife exhibits and picnic areas. Grandfather has six environmental habitats for black bear, river otters, cougars, bald eagles, and elk.

Mildred the Bear came to Grandfather Mountain in 1968 at age 2 from the Atlanta Zoo. She was named by Ralph Smith, a cast member of &quot;The Arthur Smith Show&quot;, which filmed Mildred for one of their songs. A habitat for Mildred was added in 1973. Mildred died in 1993 at age 26.

Grandfather Mountain and its surrounding communities were served by the narrow gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (The &quot;ET&amp;WNC&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Tweetsie&quot;) until the flood of 1940. The railroad helped make the mountain a favorite vacation spot for excursionists during the early 20th century.

The scene in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; where the title character runs on a curvy mountain road was filmed here.

==Climate==
Grandfather Mountain has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), cooler than most of the rest of North Carolina. Winters are cold and snowy, while summers are mild. The mountain receives abundant precipitation throughout the year, with a slight peak in June and September. The average snow depth peaks in February at 3 inches.

The earliest and latest snowfalls of the season have occurred on the dates September 10, 1964, and May 27, 1967, respectively.

<text>Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a term used to refer to several kidney diseases (usually affecting both kidneys). Many of the diseases are characterised by inflammation either of the glomeruli or of the small blood vessels in the kidneys, hence the name, but not all diseases necessarily have an inflammatory component.

As it is not strictly a single disease, its presentation depends on the specific disease entity: it may present with isolated hematuria and/or proteinuria (blood or protein in the urine); or as a nephrotic syndrome, a nephritic syndrome, acute kidney injury, or chronic kidney disease.

They are categorized into several different pathological patterns, which are broadly grouped into non-proliferative or proliferative types. Diagnosing the pattern of GN is important because the outcome and treatment differ in different types. Primary causes are intrinsic to the kidney. Secondary causes are associated with certain infections (bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens), drugs, systemic disorders (SLE, vasculitis), or diabetes.

==Signs and symptoms==
Glomerulonephritis refers to an inflammation of the glomerulus, which is the unit involved in filtration in the kidney. This inflammation typically results in one or both of the nephrotic or nephritic syndromes.

===Nephrotic syndrome===
The nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the finding of edema in a person with increased protein in the urine and decreased protein in the blood, with increased fat in the blood. Inflammation that affects the cells surrounding the glomerulus, podocytes, increases the permeability to proteins, resulting in an increase in excreted proteins. When the amount of proteins excreted in the urine exceeds the liver&#x27;s ability to compensate, fewer proteins are detected in the blood – in particular albumin, which makes up the majority of circulating proteins. With decreased proteins in the blood, there is a decrease in the oncotic pressure of the blood. This results in edema, as the oncotic pressure in tissue remains the same. Although decreased intravascular oncotic (i.e. osmotic) pressure partially explains the patient&#x27;s edema, more recent studies have shown that extensive sodium retention in the distal nephron (collecting duct) is the predominant cause of water retention and edema in the nephrotic syndrome. This is worsened by the secretion of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal gland, which is secreted in response to the decrease in circulating blood and causes sodium and water retention. Hyperlipidemia is thought to be a result of the increased activity of the liver.

===Nephritic syndrome===
The nephritic syndrome is characterised by blood in the urine (especially Red blood cell casts with dysmorphic red blood cells) and a decrease in the amount of urine in the presence of hypertension. In this syndrome, inflammatory damage to cells lining the glomerulus are thought to result in destruction of the epithelial barrier, leading to blood being found in the urine. At the same time, reactive changes, e.g. proliferation of mesangial cells, may result in a decrease in kidney blood flow, resulting in a decrease in the production of urine. The renin–angiotensin system may be subsequently activated, because of the decrease in perfusion of juxtaglomerular apparatus, which may result in hypertension.

==Nonproliferative==
This is characterised by forms of glomerulonephritis in which the number of cells is not changed. These forms usually result in the nephrotic syndrome. Causes include:

===Minimal change disease===

Minimal change disease is characterised as a cause of nephrotic syndrome without visible changes in the glomerulus on microscopy. Minimal change disease typically presents with edema, an increase in proteins passed from urine and decrease in blood protein levels, and an increase in circulating lipids (i.e., nephrotic syndrome) and is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in children. Although no changes may be visible by light microscopy, changes on electron microscopy within the glomeruli may show a fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes lining the basement membrane of the capillaries of glomerulus. It is typically managed with corticosteroids and does not progress to chronic kidney disease.

===Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis===
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterised by a sclerosis of segments of some glomeruli. It is likely to present as a nephrotic syndrome. This form of glomerulonephritis may be associated with conditions such as HIV and heroin abuse, or inherited as Alport syndrome. The cause of about 20–30% of focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis is unknown. On microscopy, affected glomeruli may show an increase in hyalin, a pink and homogeneous material, fat cells, an increase in the mesangial matrix and collagen. Treatment may involve corticosteroids, but up to half of people with focal segmental glomerulonephritis continue to have progressive deterioration of kidney function, ending in kidney failure.

===Membranous glomerulonephritis===
Membranous glomerulonephritis may cause either nephrotic or a nephritic picture. About two-thirds are associated with auto-antibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor, but other associations include cancers of the lung and bowel, infections such as hepatitis B and malaria, drugs including penicillamine, and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Individuals with cerebral shunts are at risk of developing shunt nephritis, which frequently produces MGN.

Microscopically, MGN is characterized by a thickened glomerular basement membrane without a hyperproliferation of the glomerular cells. Immunofluorescence demonstrates diffuse granular uptake of IgG. The basement membrane may completely surround the granular deposits, forming a &quot;spike and dome&quot; pattern. Tubules also display the symptoms of a typical Type III hypersensitivity reaction, which causes the endothelial cells to proliferate, which can be seen under a light microscope with a PAS stain.

Prognosis follows the rule of thirds: one-third remain with MGN indefinitely, one-third remit, and one-third progress to end-stage kidney failure. As the glomerulonephritis progresses, the tubules of the kidney become infected, leading to atrophy and hyalinisation. The kidney appears to shrink. Treatment with corticosteroids is attempted if the disease progresses.

In extremely rare cases, the disease has been known to run in families, usually passed down through the females. This condition, similarly, is called Familial Membranous Glomerulonephritis. There have only been about nine documented cases in the world.

===Thin basement membrane disease===

Thin basement membrane disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by thin glomerular basement membranes on electron microscopy. It is a benign condition that causes persistent microscopic hematuria. This also may cause proteinuria which is usually mild and overall prognosis is excellent. 

===Fibronectin glomerulopathy===

Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare form of glomerulopathy characterised by enlarged glomeruli with deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial space. The deposits have been shown to be fibronectin. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. About 40% of cases are due to mutations in the fibronectin (FN1) gene located on chromosome 2 (2q34).

==Proliferative==
Proliferative glomerulonephritis is characterised by an increased number of cells in the glomerulus. These forms usually present with a triad of blood in the urine, decreased urine production, and hypertension, the nephritic syndrome. These forms usually progress to end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) over weeks to years (depending on type).

===IgA nephropathy===
IgA nephropathy, also known as &quot;Berger&#x27;s disease&quot;, is the most common type of glomerulonephritis, and generally presents with isolated visible or occult hematuria, occasionally combined with low grade proteinuria, and rarely causes a nephritic syndrome characterised by proteinuria, and visible blood in the urine. IgA nephropathy is classically described as a self-resolving form in young adults several days after a respiratory infection. It is characterised by deposits of IgA in the space between glomerular capillaries.

Henoch–Schönlein purpura refers to a form of IgA nephropathy, typically affecting children, characterised by a rash of small bruises affecting the buttocks and lower legs, with abdominal pain.

===Post-infectious===
Post-infectious glomerulonephritis can occur after essentially any infection, but classically occurs after infection with the bacteria &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. It typically occurs 1–4 weeks after a pharyngeal infection with this bacterium, and is likely to present with malaise, a slight fever, nausea and a mild nephritic syndrome of moderately increased blood pressure, gross haematuria, and smoky-brown urine. Circulating immune complexes that deposit in the glomeruli may lead to an inflammatory reaction. 

Diagnosis may be made on clinical findings or through antistreptolysin O antibodies found in the blood. A biopsy is seldom done, and the disease is likely to self-resolve in children in 1–4 weeks, with a poorer prognosis if adults are affected or if the affected children are obese. 

===Membranoproliferative===

Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), also known as &quot;mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis,&quot; is characterised by an increase in the number of cells in the glomerulus, and alterations in the glomerular basement membrane. These forms present with the nephritic syndrome, hypocomplementemia, and have a poor prognosis. Three subtypes have been proposed:
* Type 1 MPGN is caused by immune complex deposition in the mesangium and subendothelial space, typically secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis B and C, or other chronic or recurring infections. Circulating immune complexes may activate the complement system, leading to inflammation and an influx of inflammatory cells.
* Type 2 MPGN, also known as &quot;Dense Deposit Disease&quot;, is characterised by an excessive activation of the complement system. The C3 Nephritic Factor autoantibody stabilizes C3-convertase, which may lead to an excessive activation of complement. Type 2 MPGN is a subgroup of C3 glomerulopathy, a newly proposed diagnosis which also encompasses C3 Glomerulonephritis (C3GN).
* Type 3 MPGN, which is caused by immune complex deposition in the subepithelial space.

===Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis===

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also known as &quot;crescentic GN&quot;, is characterised by a rapid, progressive deterioration in kidney function. People with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may present with a nephritic syndrome. In management, steroid therapy is sometimes used, although the prognosis remains poor. Three main subtypes are recognised:
* Type 1 is Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease also affecting the lung. In Goodpasture syndrome, IgG antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane trigger an inflammatory reaction, causing a nephritic syndrome and the coughing up of blood. High dose immunosuppression is required (intravenous methylprednisolone) and cyclophosphamide, plus plasmapheresis. Immunohistochemistry staining of tissue specimens shows linear IgG deposits.
* Type 2 is characterised by immune-complex-mediated damage, and may be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, post-infective glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and IgA vasculitis.
* Type 3 rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also called &quot;pauciimmune type&quot;, is associated with causes of vascular inflammation including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis. No immune deposits can be seen on staining, however blood tests may be positive for the ANCA antibody.

Histopathologically, the majority of glomeruli present &quot;crescents&quot;. Formation of crescents is initiated by passage of fibrin into the Bowman space as a result of increased permeability of glomerular basement membrane. Fibrin stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells of Bowman capsule, and an influx of monocytes. Rapid growing and fibrosis of crescents compresses the capillary loops and decreases the Bowman space, which leads to kidney failure within weeks or months. 

==Diagnosis==

Some forms of glomerulonephritis are diagnosed clinically, based on findings on history and examination. Other tests may include:
* Urine examination
* Blood tests investigating the cause, including FBC, inflammatory markers, and special tests (including ASLO, ANCA, Anti-GBM, Complement levels, Anti-nuclear antibodies)
* Biopsy of the kidney
* Renal ultrasonography is useful for prognostic purposes in finding signs of chronic kidney disease, which however may be caused by many other diseases than glomerulonephritis.

==Treatment==
Antibiotic therapy to prevent streptococcal infection (prophylaxis). Steroids to suppress inflammation. Provide high calories &amp; low protein, sodium &amp; potassium diet. Monitor for sign of kidney failure, heart failure, and hypertensive encephalopathy.

<text>Daniel Milton Rooney (July 20, 1932 – April 13, 2017) was an American professional football executive and diplomat best known for his association with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL), and son of the Steelers&#x27; founder, Art Rooney. He held various roles within the organization, most notably as president, owner and chairman.

Rooney implemented a philosophy and management style that emphasized open, practical and efficient management. The Steelers were very successful during his tenure, winning 15 division championships, eight AFC Championships, and an NFL record six Super Bowl Championships. In 2000, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his contributions to the game. He was also credited with spearheading a requirement that NFL teams with head coach and general manager vacancies interview at least one minority candidate, which has become known as the &quot;Rooney Rule&quot;.

Outside of football, Rooney served as the United States Ambassador to Ireland, from July 2009 until his resignation in December 2012. He was also co-founder of the Ireland-related fundraising organization The Ireland Funds.

==Early life and college==
Daniel Milton Rooney was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Kathleen (née McNulty) and Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; owner Art Rooney. In the Steelers organization, Rooney was involved in many aspects of the franchise from the time he was a young boy, often assisting his father at Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field. He grew up in the North Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh and attended North Catholic High School where he excelled as the team&#x27;s quarterback. He was also the coach for the St. Peter&#x27;s Elementary school football team, which was quarterbacked by future CIA Director and lifelong friend Michael Hayden. Rooney was mentored by Fran Fogerty, Joe Carr and Ed Kiely. These men assisted in teaching him the business of football. After graduating from Duquesne University, with his major in accounting, he knew football was what he wanted to pursue.

==Executive career==

In 1960, Rooney originally worked as director of personnel for the Steelers. By early 1969, Rooney was managing the day-to-day operations of the team and personally selected the coaching hire of Chuck Noll. Rooney was appointed team president in 1975 and was officially given full operational control of the franchise. His father remained chairman and President Emeritus, as well as the public face of the franchise, until his death in 1988. Rooney oversaw all six championship teams for the Steelers between Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl XLIII and played a role in hiring all three of the Steelers&#x27; head coaches in 1969, 1992 and 2007. 

Rooney generally avoided the spotlight, but he was a very active owner behind the scenes. Rooney helped lead the negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement of 1982, and is largely credited both by owners and players for ending a strike that lasted half of the season. He was also one of the main architects of the salary cap, which was implemented in 1993. Rooney became the patriarch and controlling owner of the team, following the death of his father. In 2003, Rooney followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by slowly ceding day-to-day operations of the franchise to the next generation of the family. While Rooney was still chairman, and to many fans, the public face of the team, his son Art Rooney II assumed full operational control of the Steelers.

In 1995, Rooney tried to stop the Steelers&#x27; biggest rival, the Cleveland Browns, from moving to Baltimore. He and Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson were the only owners to vote against the move and he was a driving force in ensuring the Browns return to Cleveland in 1999.

The Steelers&#x27; selection of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger in the 2004 NFL draft is often credited to Rooney. According to Bill Cowher, Cowher originally wanted to select offensive lineman Shawn Andrews with the 11th overall pick as he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with incumbent quarterbacks Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. Rooney made the final call on the pick, not wanting to miss out on another opportunity draft a franchise quarterback after the team passed on Dan Marino in 1983. Roethlisberger&#x27;s selection ended a quarterback drought for the franchise that persisted since Terry Bradshaw&#x27;s retirement in 1983 and led to three Super Bowl appearances between 2005 and 2010. 

Rooney was considered to be patient with the team. In 1969, head coach Chuck Noll led the team to a record of 1-13, the worst in franchise history. Rooney chose to retain Noll for the 1970 season and gave him a slight raise for his efforts during the season. Rooney never waned on his faith in Noll, retaining him despite several poor seasons near the end of his tenure and allowed him to retire in 1991 rather than firing him. Throughout the 1998 and 1999 seasons, Rooney retained Bill Cowher as the team&#x27;s head coach despite recording a combined record of 13-19 with two consecutive losing seasons. Rooney dismissed the notion of firing Cowher in February 2000 amidst rumors he would not return in 2000 stating &quot;We all recognize that we have a lot of hard work to do in the months ahead, and I am concerned that ongoing speculation about these meetings could get in the way of what we are trying to accomplish.&quot; Cowher would later lead his team to two consecutive AFC Championship appearances in 2004 and 2005, winning Super Bowl XL following the latter.

===Sale of the Steelers===
On July 7, 2008, Rooney and his son, team president Art Rooney II, announced that they were seeking to buy out his brothers&#x27; shares in the team. The team initially said that some of Rooney&#x27;s four brothers want to &quot;get out of the NFL and focus their business efforts on their racetracks and other interests.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the Steelers had &quot;been secretly shopped to potential buyers amid continuing divisions among the five sons of the team&#x27;s founder, Art Rooney Sr.&quot; This forced the Steelers to announce that prolonged, ongoing negotiations were under way concerning the &quot;restructuring&quot; of ownership, which could have resulted in the sale of the franchise or a consolidation of control within the Rooney family. Discussions had supposedly been taking place for the last two years. The use of the phrase &quot;ensure compliance with NFL ownership policies&quot; referred to the family&#x27;s gambling operation. At the time of publication, they owned Yonkers Raceway, a harness racing track outside of New York City, and Palm Beach Kennel Club, a greyhound racetrack in West Palm Beach. The New York racetrack had been owned by the family since 1972, and the Florida racetrack had been owned since 1970. The team said &quot;these facilities have added forms of gaming that are inconsistent with NFL gambling policy.&quot;, relating to the then-recent installation of slot machines. According to league policy, no NFL owner may own, directly or indirectly, any interests in a gambling casino. The NFL defines any facility with slot machines as a casino.

The Steelers&#x27; statement said that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell asked former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to &quot;serve as a league representative in discussions with the family in order to reach an agreement on the separation of the gambling interests and on a restructuring of ownership if the team is sold.&quot; Any sale involving an NFL team is subject to a league review and must be approved by 75% of member clubs. The Steelers were valued at $929 million by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in September 2007. However, Rooney&#x27;s brothers: Art Jr., Tim, Patrick and John released a statement confirming that they retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to put a price tag on the franchise, and analysts in New York placed its value between $800 million and $1.2 billion. Their shares were likely worth more than Dan and Art II had offered in the initial buyout, and it could have raised even higher and still remain under the NFL&#x27;s ceiling of $150 million in ownership debt. Each Rooney brothers&#x27; stake was worth about $160 million, or less than Dan was believed to be offering. Art Jr. was the brother who might have determined if the majority of the team remains in the Rooney family. He was formerly a Pro Football Hall of Fame nominee for his drafting skills, and was fired by Dan in 1987. The brothers likely would not have retained Goldman Sachs if they felt they could soon work out a deal with Dan. The move also reflected their fears that selling to Dan, coupled with the ensuing taxes, could leave their children and grandchildren with far less money than their shares are worth. There was also concern if any of the brothers were to die without a change in ownership, their heirs would face estate taxes of up to 45% of the shares&#x27; value. Rooney worked with Morgan Stanley and PNC Financial Services to attempt to bring in additional investors who might prop up his buyout attempt.

According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Duquesne Capital Management chairman Stanley Druckenmiller was apparently interested in acquiring the team. On July 8, The Associated Press reported that a deal could be reached within days to sell a majority interest in the Steelers to Druckenmiller, taking control of the franchise away from the Rooney family. However Rooney, stopped short of guaranteeing that he and his son, would be able to stay at the helm of a team. He hinted that &quot;many people,&quot; not just Druckenmiller, might be interested in the NFL franchise. Later, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello stated that the NFL would continue to support the Rooneys in their efforts to retain control of the Steelers, and maintained the franchise would not relocate to another city, only that the ownership will either change or be consolidated.

On November 21, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported that Tim and Pat planned to sell each of their 16% stakes in the Steelers, so they could remain involved in racetracks and casinos in Yonkers and West Palm Beach. John and Art Jr. each planned to keep a little less than half of their 16% stake, and Dan and Art II, were trying to acquire 30% of the team to abide by NFL policy and compiled a list of investors who, in essence, would become their new partners in the franchise.

==Controversies==

===James Harrison vs. Cedrick Wilson===
On March 19, 2008, Rooney released wide receiver Cedrick Wilson from the Steelers, after he was arrested for punching his former girlfriend. However earlier that month, on March 8, Rooney failed to offer any type of discipline to linebacker James Harrison for slapping his girlfriend. When asked about the incident involving Wilson, Rooney stated that &quot;the Steelers do not condone violence of any kind, especially against women&quot;. However, he was then confronted about this by Ed Bouchette and Michael A. Fuoco of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, who asked why Harrison was not punished for committing the same crime. Rooney said that the cases were different and stated that &quot;I know many are asking the question of [why] we released Wilson and Harrison we kept. The circumstances—I know of the incidents, they are completely different. In fact, when I say we don&#x27;t condone these things, we don&#x27;t, but we do have to look at the circumstances that are involved with other players and things like that, so they&#x27;re not all the same. What James Harrison was doing and how the incident occurred, what he was trying to do was really well worth it. He was doing something that was good, wanted to take his son to get baptized where he lived and things like that. She said she didn&#x27;t want to do it.&quot;

Rooney later said that Harrison had no intention of harming his girlfriend when he went to her house to pick up his son. &quot;The situation angered him. He didn&#x27;t go there with intent.&quot; Meanwhile, Rooney stated that the Wilson case was different. According to Rooney &quot;[Wilson] knew what he was doing. He knew where his [former] girlfriend was and went to the bar looking for her. When he got there he punched her. That&#x27;s different and I understand he expressed no regret.

Afterwards, Rooney was criticized by the Women&#x27;s Center and Shelter of Pittsburgh as a result of his comments. ESPN&#x27;s Matt Mosley later wrote that Rooney&#x27;s attempt to &quot;explain that Harrison&#x27;s heart was in the right place ... had to be one of the worst Public Relations moments in club history.&quot;

===Steelers taxes and taxpayer funding===
In August 2004, &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; writer Bill Steigerwald reported that Rooney&#x27;s team received $5 million in state funds for a new, $12 million amphitheater. This was in addition to the $158 million in public subsidies the organization received to build Heinz Field. Steigerwald wrote that: Since the Steelers don&#x27;t own any taxable property, the Rooneys dodge city and county real estate taxes. Heinz Field, which the Steelers operate and profit from in myriad ways, is owned by taxpayers through the Sports and Exhibition Authority. The team offices, practice field and workout facilities are leased from UPMC&#x27;s tax-exempt Sports Performance Complex. Steelers players pay payroll and occupation taxes like everyone else. Fans pay the 5 percent city amusement tax on each ticket. But the Steelers - like a few other profit-making corporations - aren&#x27;t exempt from paying both a city mercantile tax (3 mills on concessions, etc.) and a city business privilege tax (6 mills on gross receipts). Tax officials say these taxes are highly complicated to compute – and the final amounts the Steelers pay are top secret.

==Ambassador to Ireland==

On March 17, 2009, President Obama announced he had nominated Rooney to become the next U.S. ambassador to Ireland, citing the owner&#x27;s longstanding support for Irish-American charitable causes. In 2008, Rooney gave $30,000 to a Democratic Party committee that aided Obama&#x27;s campaign, according to CQ MoneyLine, a non-partisan group that tracks political contributions. According to David Lewis, a Vanderbilt University political scientist and the author of &quot;The Politics of Presidential Appointments&quot;, &quot;giving coveted ambassadorships to political supporters is a relatively low-risk way for presidents to repay campaign debts.&quot;

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swore him in as the new ambassador to Ireland on July 1, 2009. Rooney presented his credentials to Irish President Mary McAleese on July 3, before making his first official speaking engagement at a lunch hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland. In a leaked diplomatic cable to Clinton in 2009 Rooney described Irish politics as having an &quot;often unaccountable political class&quot; which allows itself &quot;perks&quot;.

In an April 2011 interview with &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Rooney mentioned that he would consider resigning his ambassadorship in order to campaign for Obama&#x27;s re-election. In a prepared statement released after that interview was published. Rooney stated, &quot;I was asked what I could do to help [Obama] in the next election and I responded that the best thing I could do would be to help him campaign. Were I to do so, it would require my resignation as ambassador to Ireland. However, I am very pleased with my accomplishments to date and I intend to continue to carry out my duties.&quot; On December 14, 2012, he resigned as ambassador to Ireland and returned to Pittsburgh. He would eventually be replaced in June 2014 by Kevin O&#x27;Malley.

==Personal life==

Rooney was married to his wife Patricia Regan for sixty-five years. They first met in the office of the Steelers where she was working, and got married soon after. The couple had nine children together, although he was predeceased by two of his daughters. Rooney was also the maternal great-uncle of actresses Kate Mara and her sister Rooney Mara.

In 2008, he surprised many with his public endorsement of Barack Obama for president. The family had traditionally been very private on politics, even being rumored to have a Republican bent. Rooney responded to his public endorsement with: &quot;When I think of Barack Obama&#x27;s America I have great hope. I support his candidacy and look forward to his Presidency.&quot;

Rooney was the benefactor of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature and vice-chairman of The American Ireland Fund. He was also a founding chairman of The Mentoring Partnership of Southwestern Pennsylvania. He was named to the PoliticsPA list of most influential individuals in Pennsylvania politics in 2002. In 2008, Rooney became an honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He won the 2009 &quot;Jack Horrigan Memorial Award&quot;, presented by the Pro Football Writers Association to honor a league or club official &quot;for his or her qualities and professional style in helping the pro football writers do their job.&quot; He was recognized in 2016 with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation.

===Death===
Rooney died at the age of 84 on April 13, 2017. Attendees at his funeral in Pittsburgh included former president Barack Obama and former secretary of state John Kerry. His burial was in Christ Our Redeemer Catholic Cemetery, Ross Township, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1196276" wikidata="Q420192" url="?curid=1196276" title="Aklilu Habte-Wold">
<text>&quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; Aklilu Habte-Wold (; 12 March 1912 – 23 November 1974) was an Ethiopian politician under Emperor Haile Selassie. He was foreign minister from 1947 to 1958 and prime minister from 1961 until his overthrow and execution by the Derg in 1974.

== Life ==
Aklilu Habte-Wold was the son of a rural Ethiopian Orthodox priest from the Bulga district of Shewa Province . He and his brothers, Makonnen Habte-Wold and Akalework Habte-Wold benefited from the patronage of Emperor Haile Selassie, who had them educated. Aklilu Habte-Wold attended the French &quot;lycee&quot; in Alexandria, then afterwards studied in France.

Upon returning to Ethiopia, Aklilu became the protégé of the powerful &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; (&quot;Minister of the Pen&quot;) Wolde Giyorgis Wolde Yohannes, another man of humble birth, who had become a powerful figure in Ethiopian government, and a close advisor to the Emperor, with his appointment as &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot;. Wolde Giyorgis recommended the sons of Habte-Wold to the Emperor, who promoted them through the ranks so that the two eldest, Makonnen and Aklilu, became particularly influential with the monarch. Their humble origins, and the fact that they owed their education and advancement solely to the Emperor, allowed Emperor Haile Selassie to trust them implicitly and to favor them and other commoners of humble origin in government appointments and high positions at the expense of the aristocracy, whose loyalty to his person, rather than to the institution of Emperor he suspected. The Emperor&#x27;s preference for such men as Aklilu Habte-Wold over the high nobles created resentment among the aristocracy, who believed they were being displaced by these new western educated &quot;technocrats&quot;.

When Ethiopia was defeated in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Aklilu Habte-Wold was in France with his brother Makonnen; upon the defection of the head of the Ethiopian legation to France, &quot;Blatengeta&quot; Wolde Mariyam Ayele, Aklilu was made &quot;charge d&#x27;affairs&quot;. Aklilu lived in Paris and married a French woman, Collette Valade. With the fall of Paris in June 1940, Aklilu managed to escape on a forged passport, and with the help of the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs he was able to reach Cairo. Following the restoration in 1941, Aklilu served as a representative to the Peace conference after the end of World War II, then served as Foreign Minister. During this time, Aklilu played a key role in the complex process that brought Eritrea into federation with Ethiopia.

===Premiereship===

Following the fall from favor of &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; Wolde Giyorgis in 1958, the Emperor appointed Aklilu to replace him as &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot;. In April 1961, four months after the previous prime minister Abebe Aragai had been killed in a failed coup, the Emperor promoted Aklilu Habte-Wold to that office, while retaining the powerful office of &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; in his portfolio. These two posts gave Aklilu a level of confidence with the Emperor that no one outside of the Imperial Family shared.

This appointment, and the following increase of commoner &quot;technocrats&quot; in positions of power and influence greatly disturbed the more conservative elements in the Imperial Family, the aristocracy, and the Ethiopian Church. Two camps evolved at court, with Prime Minister Aklilu and his fellow non-noble &quot;technocrats&quot; on one side, who dominated the various ministries and the Imperial Cabinet, against the nobility who were represented by the Crown Council, and led by &quot;Ras&quot; Asrate Medhin Kassa. Although the Emperor forbade party politics, the two rival camps behaved as such, and maneuvered against each other rather vigorously. Many issues such as land reform and constitutional change were blocked largely because of this rivalry. On the other hand, Bahru Zewde is of the opinion that &quot;Aklilu&#x27;s impact on Ethiopian politics is not so easily identifiable. He lacked the capacity for political manipulation shown by his predecessor as &quot;tsahafe t&#x27;ezaz&quot;, Walda-Giyorgis, and his own brother, Makonnen. Aklilu was more of a leading functionary than a power-broker.&quot; Former diplomat Paul B. Henze supports this view that Aklilu was not interested in reform, but repeats Aklilu&#x27;s rival &quot;Ras&quot; Asrate&#x27;s opinion that &quot;Aklilu was the primary reactionary influence on the Emperor.&quot; On the other hand, John Spencer, who knew Aklilu personally, described him as &quot;a remarkably clear and logical thinker and a formidable antagonist in encounters with foreign representatives.&quot; Spencer further explains that Aklilu&#x27;s ability was limited due, to the favoritism Emperor Haile Selassie showed him, which led to resentment and isolation from his compatriots. &quot;In that isolation his power and stature declined in direct ratio to that of His Majesty,&quot; Spencer notes, concluding that with his brother Makonnen&#x27;s death in the 1960 Ethiopian coup attempt, he lost a vital window into the psychological reactions and secret movements of his peers.

===1974 revolution===
When student protests, military mutinies and an economic downturn caused by the oil embargo erupted in 1973 into a popular uprising against the government, calls went out for Prime Minister Aklilu to be dismissed. On 23 February, then the next day, the Emperor made a number of concessions to the various groups of protesters.

Meanwhile, Aklilu had grown frustrated and weary of holding a position with much responsibility but no authority. John Spencer offers one example, only a few months prior to this crisis, of Aklilu&#x27;s loss of power:
: In foreign affairs where, for decades, his views were uncontested, he was now confronted by Minister of Foreign Affairs Minassie Haile, who did not share his views on foreign policy. For Minassie, it was sufficient to go to His Majesty to obtain a compliant authorization of an opposite line of action. A case in point ... was whether or not the Emperor should make an urgent visit to Riyadh to consult with King Faisal. Ill-advisedly, Aklilou accepted a show-down in front of His Majesty. Aklilou lost. Without a constituency, with only a vacillating monarch to turn to, Aklilou expressed to me his concern for the future.

By the time of the popular uprising, Aklilu Habte-Wold had resolved to resign, a decision opposed by Lt. General Abiye Abebe and &quot;Leul Ras&quot; Asrate Kassa. Both criticized him for abandoning the government without first having safeguarded authority, law and order in this situation. Nevertheless, Aklilu persisted in his decision, although he recommended Lt. General Abiye be his successor; however when he resigned it was Endelkachew Makonnen who became the new prime minister. Aklilu&#x27;s resignation, instead of placating the protesters, this resignation only emboldened them to make further demands.

The Crown Council had pushed the Emperor to appoint a nobleman to the position, and initially Lt. General Abiye Abebe was favored to be named the new prime minister. However and when General Abiye&#x27;s request that he be made responsible to the elected parliament rather than the Emperor was presented, the Council balked and the General asked to be dropped from consideration. Lij Endelkachew Makonnen, son of the late former prime minister, was appointed. The new Premier attempted to address the many demands being put forward by the proponents of reform, and Ethiopia seemed to be on the verge of transforming itself into a democracy and a modern constitutional monarchy. However, a committee of low ranking officers called the Derg, who had been empowered to investigate corruption in the military, arrested &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; Aklilu and most of the men who had served in his cabinet, as well as the new prime minister and his cabinet. The Derg deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on 12 September 1974 and assumed power as the Marxist military junta that would rule the country for almost two decades.

On the evening of 23 November, &quot;Tsehafi Taezaz&quot; Aklilu Habte-Wold, and his brother Akalework Habte-Wold were removed from Menelik Palace and taken to Akaki Central Prison where they were summarily executed with 60 other ex-officials of the Emperor&#x27;s government. This act led to protests around the world, not only from Europe and the United States, but also from a number of African countries who expressed their concern for the well-being of the deposed Emperor.

<text>A superzoom or ultrazoom lens is a type of photographic zoom lens with unconventionally large focal length factors, typically ranging from wide angle to extreme long lens focal lengths in one lens. There is no clear definition of a superzoom lens, but the name generally covers lenses that have a range well above the 3× or 4× (e.g., 28-85 mm or 70-210 mm) of a standard zoom lens, with lenses being 10×, 12×, 18×, or above considered superzoom.

Advantages of a superzoom lens include compositional flexibility, reduced need to swap lenses, and enhanced portability by consolidating the functionality of multiple lenses into one. Due to trade-offs in the optical design, superzoom lenses are noted for having poorer optical quality at the extreme ends of their zoom ranges, often due to distortion. The longer focal lengths are usually accompanied by optical image stabilization in order to be usable handheld.

<text>CSS &quot;Florida&quot; was a sloop-of-war in the service of the Confederate States Navy. She served as a commerce raider during the American Civil War before being sunk in 1864.

==Service history==
&quot;Florida&quot; was built by the British firm William C. Miller &amp; Sons of Toxteth, Liverpool. Launched in December 1861, she was purchased by the Confederacy from Fawcett, Preston &amp; Co., also of Liverpool, who provided her engines. Known in the shipyard as &quot;Oreto&quot; and initially called by the Confederates, the ship was the first of several foreign-built commerce raiders commissioned as into the Confederate States Navy as CSS &quot;Florida&quot;. Union naval records often referred to her as &quot;Oreto&quot; or confused her with , another Confederate vessel.

&quot;Florida&quot; departed England on 22 March 1862, bound for Nassau in the Bahamas. To avoid suspicions that she was destined for Confederate service, the ship was only loaded with enough coal to reach Nassau. However, once in Nassau she planned to meet with a Confederate ship, take on a portion of that ship&#x27;s coal, and use the additional fuel to steam to the nearest Confederate port. However, having been built under foreign licence, she was the subject of much diplomatic and intelligence correspondence. The governor of Nassau prevented &quot;Florida&quot; from attempting a rendezvous with her planned tender in Nassau harbor, so the two ships met instead near the more isolated Green Cay. There, stores, armaments, and coal were taken aboard the ship. While anchored off Green Cay, she was officially commissioned into the Confederate States Navy as CSS &quot;Florida&quot; on August 17, with Lieutenant John Newland Maffitt in command.

During her outfitting, yellow fever raged among her crew, in five days reducing her effective force to one fireman and four deckhands. In desperate plight she ran across to the Spanish colony of Cuba. In Cárdenas, Lieutenant Maffitt too was stricken with the disease.

In this condition, against all probability, Maffitt sailed her from Cárdenas to Mobile, Alabama. In an audacious dash, the &quot;Prince of Privateers&quot; braved a hail of projectiles from the Union blockaders and raced through them to anchor beneath the guns of Fort Morgan in Mobile Bay, where she was received with a hero&#x27;s welcome by the war-weary citizens of Mobile. &quot;Florida&quot; had been unable to fight back not only because of sickness but because rammers, sights, beds, locks and quoins - necessary to use her guns - had, inadvertently, not been loaded in the Bahamas. Having resupplied her stores armed with the gun accessories she lacked, along with added crew members, &quot;Florida&quot; escaped to sea on January 16, 1863 under (now) Captain John Newland Maffitt.

After coaling at Nassau, she spent six months off the coasts of North and South America and in the West Indies, with calls at neutral ports, all the while making captures and eluding the large Federal squadron pursuing her.

&quot;Florida&quot; sailed on July 27, 1863 from Bermuda for Brest, France, where she lay in the French naval dock from August 23, 1863, to February 12, 1864. There, broken in health, Maffitt relinquished command to Commander Joseph Nicholson Barney, whose ill health prompted an additional handover to Lieutenant Charles Manigault Morris. Departing for the West Indies, &quot;Florida&quot; bunkered (reloaded her coal bunkers) at Barbados, although the three months specified by British law had not elapsed since her last coaling at a British Empire port. She then skirted the U.S. coast, sailed east across the Atlantic Ocean to Tenerife in the Canary Islands and thence back southwest to Bahia, Brazil, arriving on October 4, 1864.

Anchored at Bahia on October 7, &quot;Florida&quot;, while her captain was ashore with half his crew, was caught defenseless in an legal night attack by Commander Napoleon Collins, of the U.S. Navy steam sloop-of-war . Towed to sea, she was sent to the United States as a prize, despite the Empire of Brazil&#x27;s protests at the violation of its sovereignty. Commander Collins was court-martialed and was convicted of violating Brazilian territorial rights, but the verdict was set aside by United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Collins won fame and eventual promotion for his daring capture of the raider.

At Newport News, Virginia, on November 28, 1864, &quot;Florida&quot; reached the end of her career when she sank under dubious circumstances after a collision with the United States Army Transport , a troop ferry. &quot;Florida&quot; could therefore not be delivered to Brazil in satisfaction of the final court order, and could not rejoin the Confederate States Navy.

&quot;Florida&quot; captured 37 prizes in her impressive career. Two of her prizes were absorbed into the Confederate States Navy as and and in turn took 23 more prizes.

Today, many of the artifacts from CSS &quot;Florida&quot; are at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.

<text>Coppull is a village and civil parish in Lancashire, England. It is part of the Borough of Chorley, lies around above sea level. Its population is around 8,000, having been counted at 8,300 in the 2021Census. It is bounded by Whittle Brook, Clancutt Brook, the River Yarrow, Eller Brook, Hic-Bibi Brook and Stars Brook. Coppull is located between Chorley and Standish, Greater Manchester, to the east of the A49 road near Charnock Richard.

==History==
It is possible that a Roman road between Wigan and Walton-le-Dale passed over Coppull Moor according to the Chorley and District Historical and Archaeological Society after excavating a site there in 1959 and 1985.

The settlement has an Anglo Saxon name describing its topography derived from the Old English &quot;copp&quot; a hill top and &quot;hyll&quot; a hill. The township was variously recorded as Cophull and Cophulle in 1277, Copphull in 1351, Copthull in 1374 and Coppull from 1444.

The township was originally held by the lords of Worthington until the manor of Coppull was granted to a family of that name under them. Richard of Coppull granted land to Burscough Priory. In the reign of Edward IV, Sir Thomas Stanley bought the manor and it descended with the Stanley property at Lathom until 1600 when William, Earl of Derby sold it to Edward Rigby of Duxbury. In 1755 the owners were named Livesey and John Hodson of Ellerbeck bought it in 1820. The Worthingtons were recusants who kept the old faith, Roman Catholicism. Thomas Worthington became a priest at the English College, Douai and was sent to the Tower in 1584.

Chisnall was held by a family of that name. Roger and John de Chisnall are mentioned in 1277 and 1292. Roger de Chisnall settled land and property on Roger and his brothers Robert, John and Thomas in 1347. John Chisnall, when he died in 1525, held land and property in Coppull and Worthington of the Earl of Derby. Richard Worthington was a Member of Parliament for Wigan between 1688 and 1689 and sat for Preston as a Tory in 1690. Blainscough belonged to the Worthingtons who lived there until after the Civil War.

===Industrial Revolution===
A water mill at Birkacre was leased by Richard Arkwright for cotton spinning in 1778 but was set on fire by machine wreckers in 1779. The mill was rebuilt and used for calico printing, dyeing and bleaching. Water power was replaced by steam. Birkacre Colliery opened in 1880 to supply the works which employed more than 800 people in 1883. The works and colliery closed in the 1930s and many of the buildings demolished in the 1960s.

The North Union Railway between Wigan and Preston opened in 1838. Coppull Colliery was owned by John Hargreaves. On 20 May 1852 was an explosion of firedamp, found to be caused by a lighted candle, 90 men suffering from chokedamp or burns escaped but 36 men and boys died. The colliery was renamed Hic Bibi Colliery in the 1860s. It had several owners and after it closed in the 1880s, fireclay was used at a brickworks started and operated by the Ellerbeck Collieries Company until it closed in 1959. Chisnall Hall Colliery on Coppull Moor was owned by Pearson and Knowles Coal and Iron Company in 1896 when it employed 135 underground and 48 surface workers. After 1850 Coppull grew rapidly, many rows of houses were built to house coal miners and factory workers. There were several collieries and deep shafts were sunk for the John Pit, Springfield Pit, Blainscough, Hic Bibi, Darlingtons, Ellerbeck Colliery, Birkacre and Pearsons mines. Mineral lines carried coal tubs to the main railway.

Two large red brick spinning mills, Coppull Mill in 1906, and Mavis Mill were built in the early 20th century. Coppull Mill has been converted for other uses and is a Grade II listed building.
The last surviving collieries were Chisnall Hall and Ellerbeck.

==Governance==

Coppull was a township in the ecclesiastical parish of St Wilfrid, Standish in the Hundred of Leyland. It was a member of the Chorley Poor Law Union formed in 1837 that took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law. Coppull became part of Chorley Rural Sanitary District from 1875 to 1894, and part of Chorley Rural District from 1894 to 1974. Since 1974, it is a civil parish and electoral ward in the Borough of Chorley.

==Economy==
Since the decline in manufacturing and the end of the coal industry, the village has been converted into a satellite town for commuters to Chorley and Wigan. Notable industries today include The Yew Tree Dairy, Morris&#x27; Bakery and Staveley&#x27;s egg producer.

==Transport==
Intersecting the village is the B5251 road, which connects Chorley to the Wigan-Preston Road. The village&#x27;s closest motorway connections are the M6 Junction 27 at Standish and the M61 Junction 8 at Chorley.

Coppull is served by regular Bee Network services to Wigan (the 632) and Chorley Interchange and Stagecoach bus services to Chorley. Network Chorley service operated within the village until the early/mid 2010’s. 

The village was previously served by the Blackpool to Liverpool Line which stopped at Coppull railway station but the station was closed in 1969. Recently there has been a campaign from locals to re-open the station.

==Religion==
There was a chapel in Coppull before the Reformation. After it fell into ruin, it was replaced in 1654 and was probably served from the parish church in Standish but was later used by Presbyterians. It was closed in 1715 and secured for the Church of England. A grant from Queen Anne&#x27;s Bounty in 1716 led to the appointment of a perpetual curate. It was rebuilt in 1758 and again in 1861.

The village has several places of worship, Coppull Parish C of E Church, St John the Divine C of E Church, St Oswald&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church and Spendmore Lane Methodist Church.

==Sport==
Owing to Coppull&#x27;s coal mining history and proximity to Wigan, the sport of rugby league has had a strong presence in the village. Chorley Panthers is a successful youth and amateur club based at Chisnall playing fields. Coppull is also home to Coppull United F.C, an amateur football team who currently play in the West Lancashire Premier Division.

An amateur and professional boxing club is based at Coppull Mill.

Coppull also has a long tradition of Martial Arts with both Karate and Kung Fu clubs in the district. Red Sun Shotokan Karate Club has been based at St. John&#x27;s Church Hall in Coppull since 1986 and was founded by P.A.J. Handyside, 9th Dan.

Coppull is also home to Springfield Park Leisure Centre which holds classes for all age groups including freestyle, trampolining and indoor rock climbing.

<doc id="1196304" wikidata="Q3051595" url="?curid=1196304" title="Elongated triangular orthobicupola">
<text>In geometry, the elongated triangular orthobicupola is a polyhedron constructed by attaching two regular triangular cupola into the base of a regular hexagonal prism. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated triangular orthobicupola can be constructed from a hexagonal prism by attaching two regular triangular cupolae onto its base, covering its hexagonal faces. This construction process known as elongation, giving the resulting polyhedron has 8 equilateral triangles and 12 squares. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular is Johnson solid, and the elongated triangular orthobicupola is one among them, enumerated as 35th Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
An elongated triangular orthobicupola with a given edge length formula_2 has a surface area, by adding the area of all regular faces:
formula_3
Its volume can be calculated by cutting it off into two triangular cupolae and a hexagonal prism with regular faces, and then adding their volumes up:
formula_4

It has the same three-dimensional symmetry groups as the triangular orthobicupola, the dihedral group formula_5 of order 12. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of the triangular cupola and hexagonal prism. The dihedral angle of a hexagonal prism between two adjacent squares is the internal angle of a regular hexagon formula_6, and that between its base and square face is formula_7. The dihedral angle of a regular triangular cupola between each triangle and the hexagon is approximately formula_8, that between each square and the hexagon is formula_9, and that between square and triangle is formula_10. The dihedral angle of an elongated triangular orthobicupola between the triangle-to-square and square-to-square, on the edge where the triangular cupola and the prism is attached, is respectively:
formula_11

==Related polyhedra and honeycombs==

The elongated triangular orthobicupola forms space-filling honeycombs with tetrahedra and square pyramids.&lt;br&gt;

<text>In geometry, the elongated triangular gyrobicupola is a polyhedron constructed by attaching two regular triangular cupolas to the base of a regular hexagonal prism, with one of them rotated in formula_1. It is an example of Johnson solid.

== Construction ==
The elongated triangular gyrobicupola is similarly can be constructed as the elongated triangular orthobicupola, started from a hexagonal prism by attaching two regular triangular cupolae onto its base, covering its hexagonal faces. This construction process is known as elongation, giving the resulting polyhedron has 8 equilateral triangles and 12 squares. The difference between those two polyhedrons is one of two triangular cupolas in the elongated triangular gyrobicupola is rotated in formula_1. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular is Johnson solid, and the elongated triangular gyrobicupola is one among them, enumerated as 36th Johnson solid formula_3.

== Properties ==
An elongated triangular gyrobicupola with a given edge length formula_4 has a surface area by adding the area of all regular faces:
formula_5
Its volume can be calculated by cutting it off into two triangular cupolae and a hexagonal prism with regular faces, and then adding their volumes up:
formula_6

Its three-dimensional symmetry groups is the prismatic symmetry, the dihedral group formula_7 of order 12. Its dihedral angle can be calculated by adding the angle of the triangular cupola and hexagonal prism. The dihedral angle of a hexagonal prism between two adjacent squares is the internal angle of a regular hexagon formula_8, and that between its base and square face is formula_9. The dihedral angle of a regular triangular cupola between each triangle and the hexagon is approximately formula_10, that between each square and the hexagon is formula_11, and that between square and triangle is formula_12. The dihedral angle of an elongated triangular orthobicupola between the triangle-to-square and square-to-square, on the edge where the triangular cupola and the prism is attached, is respectively:
formula_13

==Related polyhedra and honeycombs==

The elongated triangular gyrobicupola forms space-filling honeycombs with tetrahedra and square pyramids.&lt;br&gt;

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated triangular bicupola is one of the Johnson solids (). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a triangular bicupola (either triangular orthobicupola, , or the cuboctahedron) by inserting a hexagonal antiprism between its congruent halves.

The gyroelongated triangular bicupola is one of five Johnson solids which are chiral, meaning that they have a &quot;left-handed&quot; and a &quot;right-handed&quot; form. In the illustration to the right, each square face on the bottom half of the figure is connected by a path of two triangular faces to a square face above it and to the right. In the figure of opposite chirality (the mirror image of the illustrated figure), each bottom square would be connected to a square face above it and to the left. The two chiral forms of are not considered different Johnson solids.

==Formulae==
The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length &quot;a&quot;:

<doc id="1196322" wikidata="Q1340013" url="?curid=1196322" title="Nine Lives (Aerosmith album)">
<text>Nine Lives is the twelfth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on March 18, 1997. The album was produced by Aerosmith and Kevin Shirley, and was the band&#x27;s first studio album released by Columbia Records since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot;. In the United States, it peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold over two million copies. One of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Pink&quot;, won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Until &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;, &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was their longest album, at 63 minutes.

==Production==
Early recordings took place at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, where the band worked with producer Glen Ballard. There, Steven Tyler and Ballard co-wrote the lyrics for &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot;, &quot;Taste of India&quot; and &quot;Pink&quot;. Other collaborators, including Desmond Child and Taylor Rhodes, joined Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry to write songs. Child previously collaborated with Aerosmith on such hits as &quot;Angel&quot;. &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Dude (Looks like a Lady)&quot;.

Only a week before rehearsals, drummer Joey Kramer was suffering from depression, having grieved the loss of his father a few years prior. With Kramer unavailable, rumors began to circulate that the band would disband. Steve Ferrone was brought in to play drums until Kramer was able to return. &quot;I came back with a nice perspective on what I bring to the table in Aerosmith,&quot; Kramer reflected. &quot;That was healthy for me. We ended up rerecording because people were listening to the tracks and were saying some negative stuff about it and saying the band didn&#x27;t sound the same.&quot;
Originally set for a summer release in 1996, the album was delayed, because Columbia Records felt dissatisfied with the nine tracks that Aerosmith and Ballard had produced. Further issues occurred in July that year, when the band asked their manager Tim Collins to step down after almost twelve years of partnership. In his 2014 autobiography &quot;Rocks: My Life In and Out of Aerosmith&quot;, Perry recounted that Aerosmith felt betrayed by Collins, as he would pit the members against one another. With their longtime manager gone, the band decided to hire in-house producer Kevin Shirley, and set up at Avatar Studios in New York City. Shirley, who had also worked with Journey, helped with the album&#x27;s overtones and instruments, particularly the guitar sounds. In a 1997 MTV special promoting the making of &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, Tyler declared: &quot;He&#x27;s got it somewhere stuck between &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot;.&quot;

The new sessions began in September 1996, and continued to November. Following the shift in production, Kramer recovered from his depression, and returned to the studio. Instead of playing his tracks over Ferrone&#x27;s, the band rerecorded from scratch on all of the completed tracks with Kramer.
John Kalodner, Columbia&#x27;s A&amp;R executive was brought back to supervise the project, after he had been pushed off the production in Florida by Collins. He helped trim the twenty-four songs that had been written to thirteen. Initially, the band called the album &quot;Vindaloo&quot; after adding in elements of Indian music throughout some of the songs, including a sarangi intro by Ramesh Mishra on the song, &quot;Taste of India&quot;. But upon completing the track &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, the band felt that would make the perfect title, serving as a metaphor for the album&#x27;s troubled conception.

==Artwork==
The booklet for &quot;Nine Lives&quot; contains 12 pieces of album art (including the cover). Each picture contains a smaller version of the previous picture within itself. The final picture is included in the first, creating an infinite loop. It was designed by Stefan Sagmeister.

The original cover art, inspired by a painting in a book by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, features Lord Krishna (with a cat&#x27;s head and female breasts) dancing on the head of the snake demon, Kāliyā. The Hindu community protested, feeling the artwork was offensive. The band had been unaware of the source of the artwork, and the record company apologized, leading to the next prints removing the art from the cover and booklet. The new cover features a cat tied to a circus knife-thrower&#x27;s wheel.

==Reception==

In his AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine compared &quot;Nine Lives&quot; to previous Aerosmith albums stating, “&quot;Nine Lives&quot;, in contrast, is overlabored, with Aerosmith making a conscious effort to sound hip and vibrant, which ironically simply makes them sound tired.&quot; He also criticized the album&#x27;s troubled production saying, &quot;Not only are the performances perfunctory, but the songs aren&#x27;t catchy -- no matter how hard it tries, &#x27;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&#x27; never develops a hook, and it is not an exception&quot;. Elysa Gardner from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more favorable in her 1997 review concluding, &quot;For those who simply can&#x27;t abide a collection of Aerosmith tunes without its share of power ballads, &quot;Nine Lives&quot; doesn&#x27;t disappoint&quot;.

==Outtakes==
Some releases of &quot;Nine Lives&quot; feature different track listings, most notably the two Japanese editions which both feature the song &quot;Fall Together&quot;. The song was included as a B-side on the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot;. The track &quot;What Kind of Love Are You On&quot; was originally titled &quot;What Kind of Lover You Want&quot;, and was one of many outtakes left from the recording sessions in Florida. The song was re-titled &quot;What Kind of Love Are You On&quot; and features in the 1998 movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;, as well as its associated . The track was later featured on the European re-release of the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Pink&quot;. Unfinished tracks that were discarded during the recording sessions in Florida include, &quot;Bacon Biscuit Blues&quot;, &quot;Bridges Are Burning&quot;, &quot;Heart of Passion&quot;, &quot;Loretta&quot;, and &quot;Trouble&quot;. Tyler also mentioned a song called &quot;Where the Sun Never Shines&quot; during an MTV interview shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

<text>James Douglas Graham Wood (born 1 November 1965) is an English literary critic, essayist and novelist.

Wood was &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s chief literary critic between 1992 and 1995. He was a senior editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot; between 1995 and 2007. , he is Professor of the Practice of Literary Criticism at Harvard University and a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Early life and education==
James Wood was born in Durham, England, to Dennis William Wood (born 1928), a Dagenham-born minister and professor of zoology at Durham University, and Sheila Graham Wood, née Lillia, a schoolteacher from Scotland. 

Wood was raised in Durham in an evangelical wing of the Church of England, an environment he describes as austere and serious. He was educated at Durham Chorister School (on a music scholarship) and at Eton College (with the support of a bursary based on his parents&#x27; &quot;demonstrated financial need&quot;; his older brother attended Eton as a King&#x27;s Scholar). He read English Literature at Jesus College, Cambridge, where in 1988 he graduated with a First.

==Career==
===Writing===
After Cambridge, Wood &quot;holed up in London in a vile house in Herne Hill and started trying to make it as a reviewer&quot;. He began his career by reviewing books for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 1990, he won Young Journalist of the Year at the British Press Awards. From 1991 to 1995, Wood was the chief literary critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and in 1994 he served as a judge for the Booker Prize for fiction. 

In 1995, he became a senior editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot; in the United States. In 2007 Wood left his role at &quot;The New Republic&quot; to become a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Wood&#x27;s reviews and essays have appeared frequently in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; where he is a member of its editorial board. He and his wife, the novelist Claire Messud, are on the editorial board of the literary magazine &quot;The Common&quot;, based at Amherst College.

===Teaching===
Wood began teaching literature in a class he co-taught with the late novelist Saul Bellow at Boston University. Wood also taught at Kenyon College in Ohio, and since September 2003 has taught half time at Harvard University, first as a Visiting Lecturer and then as Professor of the Practice of Literary Criticism.

In 2010–11, he was the Weidenfeld Visiting Professor of European Comparative Literature in St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford.

===Ideas===
Like the critic Harold Bloom, Wood advocates an aesthetic approach to literature, rather than the more ideologically driven trends that are popular in contemporary academic literary criticism. In an interview with &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; Wood explains that the &quot;novel exists to be affecting... to shake us profoundly. When we&#x27;re rigorous about feeling, we&#x27;re honoring that&quot;. The reader, then, should approach the text as a writer, &quot;which is [about] making aesthetic judgments&quot;.

Wood coined the term hysterical realism, which he uses to denote the contemporary conception of the &quot;big, ambitious novel&quot; that pursues vitality &quot;at all costs&quot;. Hysterical realism describes novels that are characterised by chronic length, manic characters, frenzied action, and frequent digressions on topics secondary to the story. In response to an essay Wood wrote on the subject, author Zadie Smith described hysterical realism as a:
Wood coined the term &quot;commercial realism&quot;, which he identifies with the author Graham Greene, and, in particular, with his book &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;. He clarified it as attention to the minutiae of daily life, taking in mind elements of the everyday that are important owing to their supposed lack of importance. He believes it to be an effective style of writing because it captures reality by depicting banal features as well as interesting ones.

Wood emphasises throughout the book &quot;How Fiction Works&quot; (particularly in the final chapter) that the most important literary style is realism. He states:
Wood additionally attests to the significance of Flaubert in developing the form of the novel:
==Reception==
In reviewing one of his works, Adam Begley of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that Wood &quot;is the best literary critic of his generation&quot;.

Martin Amis described Wood as &quot;a marvellous critic, one of the few remaining.&quot; Fellow book reviewer and journalist Christopher Hitchens was fond of James Wood&#x27;s work, in one case giving his students a copy of Wood&#x27;s review of the John Updike novel &quot;Terrorist&quot;, citing it as far better than his own.

In the 2004 issue of &quot;n+1&quot;, the editors criticised both Wood and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, writing: Wood wrote a reply in the Fall 2005 issue, explaining his conception of the &quot;autonomous novel&quot; and pointing out the editors&#x27; hypocrisy in criticizing negative book reviews in an essay that was &quot;itself a wholly negative attack on negativity&quot;:

In response, the &quot;n+1&quot; editors devoted a large portion of the journal&#x27;s subsequent issue to a roundtable on the state of contemporary literature and criticism.

Harold Bloom, in a 2008 interview with &quot;Vice&quot; magazine, stated: Oh, don&#x27;t even mention [Wood]. He doesn&#x27;t exist. He just does not exist at all. [...] There are period pieces in criticism as there are period pieces in the novel and in poetry. The wind blows and they will go away. [...] A publisher wanted to send me [Wood&#x27;s] book and I said, &quot;Please don&#x27;t.&quot; [...] I told them, &quot;Please don&#x27;t bother to send it.&quot; I didn&#x27;t want to have to throw it out. There&#x27;s nothing to the man. He also has—and I haven&#x27;t ever read him on me—but I&#x27;m told he wrote a vicious review of me in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, which I never look at anyway, in which he clearly evidenced, as one of my old friends put it, a certain anxiety of influence. I don&#x27;t want to talk about him.

==Awards==
He was a recipient of the 2010/2011 Berlin Prize Fellowship from the American Academy in Berlin.

== Personal life==
In 1992, Wood married Claire Messud, an American novelist. They reside in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and have a daughter, Livia, and a son, Lucian.

<doc id="1196332" wikidata="Q2892113" url="?curid=1196332" title="Bavius">
<text>Bavius and Maevius (or Mevius) were two poets in the age of Augustus Caesar, whose names became synonymous with bad verse and malicious criticism of superior writers. Both are named together in Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues (3.90). Maevius is also the object of Horace&#x27;s tenth Epode, which invites the gods to drown him as he embarks on a sea voyage. The name M(a)evius is attested of several historical individuals, but whether Virgil&#x27;s Bavius and Maevius are real writers or literary inventions is unclear.

Alexander Pope mentions Bavius in his 1729 &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot; and explains, in a note, that he drew the reference from Virgil. Pope draws a parallel between these two critics and his own dunces by quoting John Dennis who thought it likely that Bavius &quot;and Maevius had (even in &quot;Augustus&#x27;s&quot; days) a very formidable Party at &quot;Rome&quot;, who thought them much superior to &quot;Virgil&quot; and &quot;Horace:&quot; For (saith he) I cannot believe they would have fix&#x27;d that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit&quot; (&quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot;). Bavius and Maevius are also like the &quot;dunces&quot; in Pope&#x27;s own &quot;Dunciad&quot; in that little is remembered of them except for their bad reputations. In the &quot;Dunciad,&quot; Book III, Pope has Bavius dip the transmigrating souls of poetasters in Lethe, making them doubly stupid before being born as hack writers. In his &quot;An Essay on Criticism,&quot; Pope writes of Maevius:

:Some are bewilder&#x27;d in the Maze of Schools,
:And some made Coxcombs Nature meant but Fools.
:In search of Wit these lose their common Sense,
:And then turn Criticks in their own Defence.
:Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write,
:Or with a Rival&#x27;s or a Eunuch&#x27;s spite.
:All Fools have still an Itching to deride,
:And fain wou&#x27;d be upon the Laughing Side;
:If Maevius Scribble in Apollo&#x27;s spight,
:There are, who judge still worse than he can write...

Maevius also features in the Earl of Roscommon&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Translated Verse&quot; as a symbol of poetic failure:
:&quot;Whoever vainly on his strength depends,
:Begins like Virgil, but like Maevius ends.&quot;
:(in J.E. Spingarn, ed., Critical Essays of the Seventeenth Century, II, p.299)

<doc id="1196342" wikidata="Q385356" url="?curid=1196342" title="Sri Guru Ram Das Ji International Airport">
<text>Sri Guru Ram Das Ji International Airport is an international airport serving Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is located at Raja Sansi, northwest from the city centre. It is named after Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru and the founder of Amritsar. The airport is the largest and the busiest airport of Punjab. It is the third-largest airport in Northern India after Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi. The airport was the 3rd fastest-growing airport in India during the fiscal year 2017–18. It is a hub of cargo movements, domestically and internationally. The airport is ranked the 6th-best regional airport in India and Central Asia in 2019 and 2020 by Skytrax. The airport is awarded as the best airport in Asia-Pacific in 2020 (2 to 5 million passengers per annum) by Airports Council International. The airport also featured in the top 10 airports in India and South Asia with Best Airport Staff for the year 2024 by Skytrax.

==History==
In 1930, the airport was established during the British era, and was used for VVIP movements. After independence, it got connected with Delhi and Srinagar. The first international flight to Kabul was launched in 1960. In January 1982, Air India started a flight from Bombay to Birmingham that stopped in Delhi, Amritsar and Moscow. The service aboard Boeing 707s linked the large North Indian population in the West Midlands to its homeland. The airline terminated it in October 1984 amid the Punjab insurgency.

In May 2005, Air India commenced service to Toronto via Birmingham using Boeing 777s. The stopover changed to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport three years later. In October 2010, the carrier replaced the route with a direct flight from its Delhi hub to Toronto. The following month, the airport&#x27;s name was changed to Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport. British Midland International (BMI) launched a flight to London-Heathrow via Almaty in October 2011. The company flew the route with an Airbus A330. The link ceased in October 2012 as a consequence of the merger between BMI and British Airways. In February 2018, Air India resumed nonstop service to Birmingham on Boeing 787s.

==Facilities==
In July 2001, the construction of the first phase of the terminal building started, along with the extension of the existing runway, construction of a new Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower and other works. The construction of all Phase-1 works was completed in June 2006. The arrivals section of the terminal building was inaugurated in September 2005, and the departures section was made operational in March 2006. Over the years, the old terminals (existing and Phase-1) were systematically razed, paving way for a new integrated terminal building (Phase-2). The terminal is made with built-in glass and steel and is equipped with an in-line X-ray baggage inspection and conveyor system, Flight Information Display System (FIDS), Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE), and CCTV surveillance, which were inaugurated on 25 February 2009, with an area of approximately , marking an improvement over the earlier facility. The integrated building is a blend of modern and Indian designs, constructed in glass and steel with Indian style arches and colours. In June 2016, the airport registered a 59.6% growth of international passenger traffic.

The integrated terminal building has four jetbridges, an annual capacity of 2.5 million passengers with a peak hour capacity of 1,200 passengers. It has 30 check-in counters, 4 X-ray scanners (for baggage), 26 immigration counters, 10 custom counters, 12 security check booths, and 4 conveyor belts for arrivals. The apron has been extended to cater for parking of a total of 25 aircraft (8 Category &#x27;E&#x27;, 3 Category &#x27;D&#x27; and 13 Category &#x27;C&#x27; types of aircraft &amp; 1 category &#x27;E&#x27; for cargo) from the earlier capacity of 15 aircraft and strengthened for parking of Category &#x27;C&#x27; type of aircraft. An additional apron has also been constructed in between the taxiway and the runway. The departure and arrival halls operate duty-free shops, foreign currency exchange service, restaurants and other shops for the convenience of departing passengers. The airport registered India&#x27;s highest passenger growth of over 48% for the year 2017–2018.

==Terminal==

The airport is spread over an area of 40,000 sq.m., with 30 check-in counters, 26 immigration counters, 12 custom counters, and two security check booths, and can handle 600 passengers at arrivals and 600 passengers at departures. It has the capacity to serve more than 2.5 million passengers per year. It has four jetbridges.

==Runways==
The airport&#x27;s runway is equipped with CAT III-B ILS, which makes the airport suitable for aircraft landing in poor weather conditions and visibility. It was installed in 2016–17, when the runway underwent a mass upgrade, at a cost of ₹ 150 crore, and in October 2017, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) issued low visibility procedures (LVP), thus allowing landing at within 50 m visual range. Before the installation of CAT III ILS, CAT II ILS was installed in December 2011 and reduced the visibility requirement for an aircraft landing at the airport on Runway 34, from the existing 650 metres to 350 metres, thus benefiting airlines in increased safety and avoiding diversions to other airports, resulting in better operational and environmental efficiencies.

== Airlines and destinations ==


;Note:

== Statistics ==
==Future plans==
To meet the growing demands and future traffic, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has proposed to expand the current integrated passenger terminal at a cost of ₹ 240 crore, which will increase the existing handling capacity of 2.5 million passengers per year to 5.5 million passengers per year. Along with this, an additional ₹ 60 crore were invested for the construction of another apron, taxiways and upgrading of the terminal, which are now completed. 
The airport is also proposed to be leased out for privatization on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis, along with 5 other major airports operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). With privatization, the infrastructure at the airport is expected to rapidly improve further.
With the completion of the under-construction Delhi–Amritsar–Katra Expressway, the travel time from Amritsar to Delhi Airport will be cut in half from the current over 8 hours to about 4 hours. This may result in reduction in passenger growth on this route, but will give better road connectivity between the city and the National Capital.

==Ground transport==
===Road===
The airport is connected by the four-lane National Highway 354, which runs from Amritsar to Ajnala. Both Ola Cabs and Uber are available in the city. Auto rickshaws and local buses also connect the city to the airport. The under-construction Delhi—Amritsar—Katra Expressway will have the first branch from Delhi to the airport, and the second branch to Katra in Jammu and Kashmir, which will improve the connectivity further.

===Metrobus===
The airport was connected by Route 501 of Amritsar Metrobus, which connected it directly to Amritsar Junction, Golden Temple and many other locations in the network of Amritsar Metrobus. This route used to operate at a frequency of every 10–15 minutes but it is not functional these days.

<text>The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a 2003 novel by Mitch Albom. It follows the life and death of a ride mechanic named Eddie (inspired by Albom&#x27;s uncle), who is killed in an amusement park accident and sent to heaven, where he encounters five people who had a significant impact on him while he was alive. It was published by Hyperion and remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 95 weeks.

== Plot ==

On his 83rd birthday, amusement park ride mechanic Eddie is killed in an accident when a ride breaks down. During the accident, he makes a desperate attempt to save a little girl&#x27;s life.

Eddie arrives in Heaven, where he meets &quot;the Blue Man.&quot; The Blue Man explains that Eddie is about to journey through Heaven&#x27;s five levels, meeting someone who has had a significant impact upon his life or someone on whom his life had a significant impact. Eddie asks why the Blue Man is his first person, and he informs Eddie that, when Eddie was very young, he caused the car accident that killed him. From this, Eddie learns his first lesson: there are no random events in life and all individuals and experiences are connected in some way.

Eddie meets his former captain from the army, who reminds Eddie of their time together as prisoners of war in a forced labor camp in the Philippines. Their group burned the camp during their escape and Eddie, while running away, remembers seeing a shadow move in one of the huts. The Captain confesses that he shot Eddie in the leg to prevent Eddie from chasing the shadow into the fire. This saved Eddie&#x27;s life despite leaving him with a lifelong severe limp. Eddie then learns how the Captain died: he stepped on a land mine that would have killed all the men had he not set it off.

Eddie finds himself outside a diner, where he sees his father through a window. A well-dressed woman named Ruby appears and introduces herself to him. Ruby explains that Ruby Pier was named after her by her husband Emile, who built it in tribute to her. Ruby shows Eddie the true cause of his father&#x27;s death, which is different from what he had always believed. She tells Eddie that he needs to forgive his father.

Eddie meets his late wife, Marguerite. They remember their wedding, and Marguerite teaches Eddie that love is never lost in death; it just moves on and takes a different form.

Eddie awakens to see children playing along with a riverbed. A young Filipina girl named Tala comes up to him. Tala reveals that she was the little girl from the hut that Eddie set on fire. Distraught, Eddie breaks down both cursing and asking God &quot;why?&quot; Tala hands him a stone and asks him to &quot;wash&quot; her like the other children in the river are doing to one another. Eddie is puzzled, but dips the stone in the water and starts to scrape off the injuries he had inflicted on her. Tala&#x27;s wounds begin to clear until she is freed of all the scars. Eddie asks Tala if she knows if he was able to save the little girl before his death. Tala tells him he did manage to push her out of the way. In this way, Tala explains, he also managed to atone every day for her unnecessary death.

In the end, it shows that Eddie&#x27;s Heaven is the Stardust Band Shell, where he met Marguerite.

== Major characters ==

* Eddie: The protagonist; at the start of the story, he is killed on his 83rd birthday.
* Marguerite: Eddie&#x27;s wife whom he met at Ruby Pier and married after returning from World War II.
* Joseph Corvelzchik, The Blue Man: Joseph is the first man Eddie meets in Heaven. His skin had been turned blue when he was a boy because of the repeated ingestion of silver nitrate, thought to be an effective medication at the time.
* The Captain: Eddie&#x27;s commanding officer during the war.
* Ruby: A middle-aged widow for whom Ruby Pier is named by her fiancé Emile.
* Emile: Ruby&#x27;s husband, who also created the original Ruby Pier.
* Mickey Shea: An alcoholic Irishman, the longtime close friend of Eddie&#x27;s mother and father. Mickey is impulsive, festive, and lonely. Mickey helps Eddie&#x27;s father get his job at Ruby Pier, and when Eddie is born, he gives his parents money to help with their financial struggles.
* Tala: Eddie&#x27;s fifth person in heaven, a little Filipino girl who Eddie unknowingly killed while he and his unit are escaping captivity during the war. Tala is affectionate, trusting, and wise. Following her mother&#x27;s instructions, Tala hides from Eddie and his men in one of the abandoned village huts.
* Nicky: Mentioned only briefly, a teenage boy who frequently visits Ruby Pier. Nicky turns out to be the grandson of Ruby, for whom the amusement park was named. Nicky loses his car key on the ride &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Free Fall&quot; a few weeks before Eddie dies.

== Reception ==
Janet Maslin, writing in &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;, gave a cynical review, calling the story &quot;a string of reassuring verities.&quot; While she thought the story manipulative, she acknowledged its power to comfort people. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;&#x27;s review was far more positive, comparing the book favorably to &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and saying it would be &quot;cherished by a vast readership.&quot;

== Adaptation ==
A made-for-television film adaptation of the novel, produced by Hallmark Entertainment, directed by Lloyd Kramer, and filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, premiered on ABC in 2004. Jon Voight starred as Eddie, with Ellen Burstyn as Ruby and Jeff Daniels as the Blue Man. &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, calling it too slow-paced and overly sentimental. The review suggested the film was only made due to the success of &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot;, another film based on an Albom novel.

<text>Field-Marshal Shree Maharaja Sir Mohan Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana (), GCB, GCIE, GBE (23 December 1885 – 6 January 1967) was the prime minister and foreign minister of Nepal from 30 April 1948 until 12 November 1951.

He was the last prime minister from the Rana family, which had controlled Nepal for more than a century and reduced the monarchy to a figurehead. He was the son of the 5th Rana Maharaja of Nepal Chandra Shumsher and Bada Maharani Chandra Loka Bhakta Lakshmi Devi. He became prime minister at a time when the king, Tribhuvan was attempting to assert himself. Tribhuvan wanted to establish a stronger monarchy and some democracy, which Mohan Shumsher opposed.

In 1950, Mohan Shumsher&#x27;s policies against the monarchy forced Tribhuvan and his son Mahendra to flee to India with the help of the Indian Residency and the Indian government, which led Mohan Shumsher to proclaim Mahendra&#x27;s three-year-old son Gyanendra the king of Nepal.

Later in the revolution of 1951, Tribhuvan returned to Nepal after signing the Delhi Treaty between Mohan Shumsher, Tribhuvan, and Congress thus restoring his throne and bringing the stately power back to the monarch. By the end of 1951, the King and his allies in Congress had triumphed, and Mohan Shumsher and the rest of the Rana family lost power. The Ranas were removed from all the hereditary offices and privileges conferred by King Surendra Bikram Shah on Jung Bahadur even though Mohan Shumsher still held the office of the prime minister, several demonstrations by Rana supporters in an attempt to reestablish their rule and the opposition of the monarchy and Congress forced him to resign from his position.

==Death==
On 14 December 1951, Mohan Shumsher went into self-imposed exile in India, and died in Bangalore in 1967, aged 81.

==Legacy==
Despite the family&#x27;s loss of their grip on the position of Prime Minister, his and his brother&#x27;s descendants still hold considerable power and wealth in Nepal.

<text>Chater Garden, located in the Central District of Hong Kong, is a public park directly east of the Legislative Council building. It is named after Sir Paul Chater, as is the adjacent Chater Road.

==History==

In the early days of British rule in Hong Kong, the site was part of the Murray Parade Ground. Then in 1851, it was opened as a sports and recreation area and became home to the Hong Kong Cricket Club and its ground. In 1975, Chater Garden took up the space left by the club when it moved to Wong Nai Chung Gap. The garden was developed in the 1970s, and formally opened on 20 October 1978.

Due to its proximity to the seat of government, the garden has been used as a location for political rallies and demonstrations by groups in Hong Kong such as Falun Gong.

<doc id="1196369" wikidata="Q7566983" url="?curid=1196369" title="South Dakota School of Mines and Technology">
<text>The South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology (South Dakota Mines, SD Mines, or SDSM&amp;T) is a public university in Rapid City, South Dakota. It is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents and was founded in 1885. South Dakota Mines offers bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees.

==History==
The cornerstone of the first School of Mines (then known as the &quot;Dakota School of Mines&quot;) building was dedicated on August 19, 1885, with the first classes being held February 21, 1887. John W. Hancher received the first bachelor of science degree at the first commencement on May 31, 1888. The school became known as the &quot;South Dakota School of Mines&quot; in 1889 after admission of South Dakota as a state to the United States.

The School of Mines presented exhibits during the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair and the first licensed radio station in the state of South Dakota was established on campus in December 1911, a full decade before WCAT (the precursor the current campus station KTEQ-FM). The first &quot;M-Day&quot; homecoming celebration occurred on October 5, 1912 with the construction of the &quot;M&quot; on M-Hill, the school&#x27;s mountain monogram. The school&#x27;s ROTC battalion was formed in 1918 in response to World War I. The football stadium began construction in 1931, and was completed as &quot;O&#x27;Harra Field&quot; in 1938.

The school formally became the South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology in February 1943.

In September 2012, South Dakota Mines made national news when Bloomberg announced that it had passed Harvard in the category of starting salaries for graduates. On September 19, Tech President Robert A. Wharton died due to complications of cancer treatments. During the presidential search, Duane C. Hrncir was the interim president.

On April 25, 2013, the School of Mines announced that Heather Wilson would become the first female president in the school&#x27;s 128-year history, starting in June 2013. She resigned in 2017 after being appointed to the office of Secretary of the United States Air Force.

In October 2017, the School of Mines announced that the next president would be James (Jim) Rankin, Ph.D. He retired in 2024. 

==Academics==
South Dakota Mines offers degrees in 20 engineering and science fields, as well as 18 master&#x27;s degree programs and 9 Doctorate programs. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Mechanical Engineering (64)
*Computer and Information Sciences (47)
*Civil Engineering (47)
*Industrial Engineering (41)
*Chemical Engineering (31)
*Electrical and Electronics Engineering (23)

The South Dakota Mines placement rate for graduates with a bachelor’s degree is 97 percent, with an average starting salary of more than $66,500.

==Campus==
The campus is located in the center of Rapid City, on the northern slope of small foothills of the Black Hills.

The APEX Gallery is located in Classroom Building 211, and hosts a new exhibit every four to six weeks. The gallery hosts contemporary works of artists and scientists, many of whom are nationally and internationally recognized.

===Museum of Geology===

Opening the same year as the school, the &quot;Museum of Geology&quot; collects, conserves, curates, interprets, and exhibits paleontologically, mineralogically, and geologically significant objects and serves as the repository for such objects from South Dakota and the Northern Great Plains. The public exhibits of the museum have been housed since 1944 in the second floor of the then newly completed O&#x27;Harra Building, while the preparation laboratories and collections are held in the James E. Martin Paleontology Center, constructed in 2009.

==Student organizations==
Active fraternities on campus include Alpha Chi Sigma, Delta Sigma Phi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Chi Psi, Theta Tau, and Triangle. Sororities include Alpha Delta Pi and Beta Delta Mu. Student government organizations include the Student Association Senate.

Student media organizations include KTEQ-FM (the campus radio station) and &quot;the Aurum&quot; (the campus newspaper, formerly known as &quot;the Tech&quot; and then &quot;the Raver&quot;). &quot;The Aurum&quot; is the original name of the school newspaper, first published in November 1901. The newspaper changed its name back to &quot;The Aurum&quot; in January 2010. The campus radio station, KTEQ, was started in 1922 as a low-powered AM station, left the air in 1955, and returned as the FM-station KTEQ in 1971 and airs a freeform programming format.

Amplify College Ministries, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Lutheran Campus Ministry, the Newman Center, and United Campus Ministries are some of the many Christian and religious groups operating on campus. Service organizations on campus include Circle K and Gamers for Service.

==Athletics==
South Dakota Mines athletic teams are called the &quot;Hardrockers&quot;, coming from its mining background. The history of the athletic programs stretch back to 1895 when the first school football team formed, originally named the &quot;Longhairs&quot;. The school host a variety of college sports which include: football, basketball, volleyball, track, cross country, golf, and men&#x27;s soccer. The athletic mascot name is Grubby the Miner. The school is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and competes at the Division II level. The school joined the Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference in January 2014 for the majority of its sports (effective beginning the 2014–15 school year), except for men&#x27;s soccer which joined the Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) for men&#x27;s soccer in 2013 and football beginning in 2014.

The Hardrockers formerly competed as members of the Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2000–01 to 2010–11, and were former members of the South Dakota Intercollegiate Conference (SDIC) (also from the NAIA) until after the 1999–2000 school year.

<text>Dumitru Burlan (born May 11, 1939) is a Romanian former Securitate officer.

==Biography==
Dumitru Burlan was born on May 11, 1939, in Licurici, Gorj County, in a family of poor peasants with seven children. In 1950, after graduating from primary school in his native village, his father brought him to Bucharest. In the capital, he was enrolled into the military school.

In August 1960, at the age of 21, he was ranked as junior lieutenant in the State Security Department. In the 1960s, his hierarchical bosses were Soviet advisers or close-knits, such as Gheorghe Pintilie, alias Pantiusha Bondarenko.

In 1965, when Nicolae Ceaușescu was elected head of the Romanian Communist Party, Dumitru Burlan worked in the 7th Directorate (Surveillance and Investigations) with the rank of lieutenant-major. In 1989, he had the lieutenant colonel rank, Specialist Officer I at the 5th SSD Directorate. He worked for 30 years in the Securitate, including 22 years in the 5th Directorate.

During the communist period, he worked for the Securitate. He was the chief of bodyguards of President Nicolae Ceaușescu, and served once as his stand-in (double), but was not able to protect Ceaușescu from arrest and execution during the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Ten years after the revolution, he published his understanding of the revolutionary events and his beliefs about Ceaușescu. After publishing details about the coup, he received several death threats. He declared himself proud of having served Ceaușescu, and he considers Ceaușescu to have been one of the most intelligent and greatest leaders in history.

Burlan published his memoirs in 2003.

<text>The Halifax Panthers are a professional rugby league club in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. They play home games at The Shay and compete in the Championship, the second tier of British rugby league.

Halifax Panthers have won the League Championship four times and the Challenge Cup five times.

They have rivalries with neighbours Bradford of the Championship, Huddersfield of Super League, fellow Championship side Featherstone Rovers, and Pennines rivals Oldham and Rochdale. The club&#x27;s traditional home colours are blue and white hoops, white shorts, and blue and white socks.

== History ==
===1873–1939: early years===

The club was founded as Halifax in 1873 when a group of young men from the Halifax Rifle Volunteers put an advert in the local press to invite anyone interested in &quot;football&quot; to a meeting at the Upper George Hotel.

A year later, Halifax played their first inter-club rugby football game when they played Leeds Athletic Club in a match held at Woodhouse Moor in Leeds on the 21st of November 1874. This first game resulted in a draw. The first home game was played a month later against Wakefield Trinity on a cricket field in King Cross Street, which again resulted in a draw. In these early years, matches were played at Ovenden, Savile Park and Hanson Lane.

After winning the first Yorkshire Cup in 1878 beating York in the final at Leeds, they went on to win it on another four occasions. Several players were picked for the Yorkshire County side in these years, and five were for the England rugby union team. In 1886, the club moved to Thrum Hall, which would be their home ground for the next 112 years. The first game there was played on 18 September 1886 against Hull F.C. and drew 8,000 spectators.

After the 1890-91 season, Halifax along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge, Manningham and Wakefield decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs.

Halifax were founding members of the breakaway Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895 when leading rugby clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire left the Rugby Football Union over issues related to leglising payments to players and playing in competitive leagues. In 1896, Halifax lost out on winning the first ever Rugby Football League Championship by a single point, with Manningham becoming the inaugural champions. In 1902–03, they achieved the &#x27;double&#x27; by winning the Challenge Cup and finishing top of Division One. They won the cup again the following season, and were the first ever Championship play-off winners in 1906–07.

Halifax won their first Wembley Challenge Cup final in 1931, beating York F.C. 22–8. An estimated 100,000 people lined the route to a civic reception at the town hall.

Towards the end of the 1937 season, Streatham and Mitcham folded after just one full season in the league. The club had made a number of high-profile signings from the New Zealand All Blacks, including George Nēpia and Charles Smith, and these players now joined Halifax.

In 1938, Halifax reached the semi-final of the Challenge Cup, after winning three replays in a row, before they were knocked out by Barrow at Fartown, Huddersfield in the dying seconds of the game.

In 1939, Halifax became the last team to win the Challenge Cup final before the war. Favourites Salford were beaten 20–3 in front of a record 55,453 spectators.

During the Second World War, Halifax reached the Challenge cup finals in 1941 and 1942, but lost both times to Leeds in matches held at Odsal.

===Post–Second World War===

In 1947, Halifax&#x27;s Hudson Irving died from a heart attack while playing at Dewsbury.

In 1949, Halifax&#x27;s David Craven died after breaking his neck playing against Workington Town.

The 1949 Challenge Cup final was sold out for the first time as 95,050 spectators saw Bradford Northern beat Halifax.

In the 1950s, Halifax were Championship runners-up three times, beat Hull F.C. in Yorkshire Cup finals in 1954 and 1955, and were Yorkshire League winners in 1950, 1953, 1954 and 1956. Halifax were unbeaten at their home ground of Thrum Hall between December 1952 and November 1956. They played in a Wembley final of the 1953–54 Challenge Cup, featuring in the first ever drawn final against Warrington in 1954, losing in the replay at Odsal Stadium, Bradford in front of what was then a world record rugby league crowd officially given as 102,569, although estimates suggest another 20,000 plus entered unofficially.

After securing a Yorkshire league and cup double in 1955–56, the club was in sight of winning &quot;All Four Cups&quot;. Wembley was reached after an 11–10 Challenge Cup semi-final victory over Wigan at Odsal and Halifax beat St. Helens 23–8 in the Championship semi-final. However, St Helens ran out 13–2 winners in the Challenge Cup and a week later, Halifax lost in the Championship match against Hull at Maine Road, Manchester, a last minute penalty goal securing a 10–9 victory for Hull.

In 1959, Halifax hosted Wigan before a club record 29,153 people in the third round of the Challenge Cup.

Halifax won their third Championship in 1964–65 after finishing 7th in the league table and progressing through the new 16-team play-offs. They became Champions by beating St Helens 15–7 in the Championship Final held at Station Road, Swinton. Terry Fogerty of Halifax was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy for man-of-the-match.

In 1965–66 Halifax again reached the Championship Final through the play-offs, after finishing 10th in the league table. Their opponents were again St Helens who this time ran out comfortable winners by 35–12.

===1960–1996: financial difficulties===

Halifax was hit hard by revenue shortfalls during the late 1960s, and 1970s. Fortunes on the pitch suffered as the shortfall was met by selling players. In 1970, a concert was held at Thrum Hall in an attempt to alleviate these financial troubles. Horrific weather conditions meant that only around 3,000 arrived to watch the Halifax Pop and Blues Concert which made a loss of £6,000.

Despite victory in the inaugural Regal Trophy Final (called the Players No. 6 Trophy for sponsorship purposes) in 1971–72, financial problems continued for the next decade. In 1983, local businessman, David Brook provided much needed investment in the club.

The 1977–78 season saw Halifax hit rock bottom with a losing streak of 24 consecutive defeats, including a game against amateurs Cawoods. Fax won only two matches all season and finished bottom of the rugby league pyramid.

Chris Anderson was player-coach of Halifax from November 1984 to May 1987, then he retired from playing but remained as coach in 1987–88. He brought over Australian internationals such as Graham Eadie and Tony Anderson. The team climbed out of the Second Division, won the League Championship in 1985–86, the 1986–87 Challenge Cup against St. Helens and made a second successive appearance in the Challenge Cup final in 1988 when they lost to Wigan. Despite this on-field success, Halifax were banned from signing new players by the RFL after complaints of non-payments in November 1988.

In 1989, John Dorahy took up a position as captain-coach of Halifax for the 1989–90 season. Halifax players threatened strike action over unpaid wages in April 1990. The club sold Neil James for £20,000 to pay wages but were still in financial trouble including an unpaid tax bill of £70,000. Halifax went into the hands of receivers, £760,000 in debt, a take-over bid having failed after the players refused to take a pay cut. The club was re-formed and the assets were purchased by the Marsland/Gartland consortium of local businessmen.

Peter Roe was appointed as head coach at Halifax for 1990–91, during which the team achieved promotion to the First Division along with Salford, who were their opponents in the Second Division Final at Old Trafford. During this season, in October 1990, the club set its still current record victoryan 82–8 win over Runcorn Highfield at Thrum Hall.

Roe was removed from office 24-hours after the 1991 Final, when he refused to a demand that he re-apply for his own job; the Halifax board had told him that he did not have the required experience for a club in the top division, and would have to stand against other new applicants. Roger Millward took the coaching job at Halifax, but was only there 17 months before resigning. Mal Reilly became the coach in 1992. In August 1993, in financial trouble again, Halifax put seven players on the transfer list for a total of £170,000.

===1996–2002: summer era===

In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. In the lead-up, the Halifax President, Tony Gartland, and former Chairman, Peter Marsland, left the board over plans to merge with rivals Bradford Northern and join the proposed Super League as single club.

Halifax joined the Super League in 1996, the local newspaper did a poll of suggested nicknames for the club with Halifax Bombers topping the list. But the Board upon the recommendation of Chief executive Nigel Wood chose &quot;Halifax Blue Sox&quot;. However, this proved to be unpopular with most supporters who continued to refer to them as &#x27;Fax&#x27;. Halifax finished third in Super League in 1998 under John Pendlebury.

Halifax sold Thrum Hall for £1.5 million to Asda for a supermarket development in 1998, and moved across town to their present home, the Shay stadium, which they share with the town&#x27;s football club Halifax Town. The proceeds from the sale were supposed to enable Halifax RLFC to make a contribution to the costs of a redevelopment of the Shay stadium, but the money was swallowed up by debts.

Under Chief Executive Nigel Wood, Halifax went to Jacksonville University, Florida, in 2000 to help develop American rugby league, along with Salford.

Steve Linnane joined the club as assistant coach from Rochdale Hornets and took full charge after Gary Mercer&#x27;s resignation. With the club threatened again by financial problems and the danger of relegation Halifax sacked coach Steve Linnane in August 2002, the morning after a 64–0 loss to St. Helens, which came after nine losses from ten games which put the club at risk of relegation. Replacement Tony Anderson signed a deal that covered the four remaining matches of this season.

===2003–2008: relegation and financial difficulties===
The club returned to their traditional Halifax RLFC name at the start of 2003. At the end of the 2003 season they were relegated from Super League to National League One. Halifax&#x27;s financial troubles meant they were unable to retain a full-time team and they struggled in the new league. In 2004 having been saved from insolvency by their new chairman Howard Posner they narrowly avoided a second relegation to National League 2, with a last-gasp victory in a play-off with York City Knights.

Anthony Farrell was asked to become temporary coach until the end of the year following the sacking of Tony Anderson. After saving the club from relegation the following season and taking the club within a whisker of a place in the grand final, they lost out to Castleford. The year after was less successful and after a poor series of results including a club record loss to Hull Kingston Rovers, Farrell lost his job. Martin Hall took over the role of head coach in June 2006.

In August 2006, Halifax was on the verge of going bust. The club announced that it needed to raise £90,000 or it would go into liquidation. Rugby league fans nationwide rallied behind &#x27;Fax&#x27;, and through visits to the ground during home fixtures and other fund-raising events, were able to raise £55,000. Howard Posner then came forward and announced that he would loan the club the remaining £35,000 in order to keep Halifax alive, repayment of the loan was waived. Posner and the new board of directors subsequently invested further sums to ensure the club could survive and that Halifax would be playing in National League One during 2007. Howard Posner, again became club Chairman and Martin Hall took up the post of director of football in October 2006. Assistant coach Matt Calland was then named the new head coach of Halifax.

===2009–present: rebuilding and championship success===
In the 2009 Challenge Cup Halifax came within moments of reaching the quarter-finals, losing by one point in extra time to Castleford. They also lost the final of the Co-Operative Championship to Barrow 26-18. However, Barrow were later stripped of the title due to salary cap breaches. In April 2010, with the club on a sound financial footing, Howard Posner stepped down as chairman and was replaced by long time supporter and director Michael Steele. In 2010, Halifax won the Co-Operative Championship, beating Featherstone Rovers 23–22 in the final after extra time. It was the first trophy Halifax had won in 23 years. But the club were not promoted back to Super League as promotion to super league was on a franchise basis at that time.

In 2011, Halifax reached the Northern Rail Cup Final at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool, losing narrowly to Leigh in the last minute. They were also unable to defend their Championship title, losing heavily to Sheffield Eagles in the play-offs. Karl Harrison took over as head coach at the end of the season.

The following season, Halifax made it to the final of the Northern Rail Cup but this time were victorious over favourites Featherstone Rovers beating them 21–12 in a match watched by over 7,000 spectators. In 2015 Halifax finished the regular season in the top four of the Championship, earning them a place in the qualifiers. Despite being the lowest ranked team in the competition, and part-time, they beat promotion favourites Leigh and Sheffield Eagles to finish 6th out of 8, and secured improved central funding for 2016.

After a disappointing 6th place finish in 2016, the club again reached the qualifiers in 2017 and 2018 finishing 3rd and 4th respectively. This made the club the most successful part-time team in the RFL. Long serving director and chairman Michael Steele stepped down from the Board at the end of 2017.

In December 2020, Halifax RLFC adopted the name &quot;Halifax Panthers&quot;. 
In the 2021 Championship season, Halifax Panthers finished in third place and qualified for the play-offs. After defeating Whitehaven in the first week, Halifax travelled to Featherstone with the winner to play Toulouse Olympique in the Million Pound Game. Halifax would lose the match 42-10 which ended their season. It was also the final game for the retiring Scott Grix.
In the 2022 RFL Championship season, Halifax finished third and qualified for the play-offs. However, they would be eliminated in the first week of the play-offs by York City losing 26-24.

In September 2024, the club was threatened with closure due to an outstanding bill to HMRC.
On 11 September 2024, the club managed to stave off liquidation after paying their outstanding debt to the HMRC.

==Stadiums==
===1886–1998: Thrum Hall===

Shortly after they were founded in 1873, Halifax bought some land in Halifax from a farmer with the aim to build a multipurpose sports venue. Thrum Hall hosted rugby league finals and test matches as well as speedway. Halifax played at Thrum Hall for 112 years, until they sold the land for £1.5 million to ASDA to move to a new stadium in the Super League era.

Thrum Hall was notable for its distinctive slope. As it was built on the side of a hill, the ground had a four yard slope from the main grandstand side to the outer wing.

Thrum Hall had a spectator capacity of 9,832 when it closed as a sports venue.

=== 1999–present: the MBi Shay ===
Halifax first played at the Shay in the 1998 Super League season and ground shared with association football team Halifax Town. The Shay has a current capacity of 14,061 (5,830 seated).

The Shay hosted games during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup.

==Colours and badge==

===Colours===
Halifax have traditionally played in blue and white. Their home jersey is blue and hoops and their away colours have been in recent seasons a combination of red, black and white, replacing their traditional red and white hoops.

===Badge===
Since its formation in 1873, Halifax used the town&#x27;s coat of arms as a crest as many other clubs did until the advent of Super League, Halifax and many other clubs, changed their names and badge thus becoming known as the Halifax Blue Sox from the 1996 season. This however was unpopular with fans and the name was reverted to &#x27;Halifax&#x27; and the town coat of arms was reintroduced with Halifax under it.

==Kit manufacturers and sponsors==
In 2022, a consortium named PK 2022 Ltd took control of the club.

==Youth and community development==

Activities:

Blue Base Study Support Centre was a community sporting initiative sponsored by Halifax, and part of the national Playing For Success educational scheme launched for school pupils to interact with professional sports teams, to help provide motivation to young people. Locally, Blue Base was working with an initiative established by the DfES, in partnership with Calderdale Children and Young People&#x27;s Services and Halifax. The funding ceased in March 2011, when the Blue Base Centre closed.

The centre existed to support Calderdale schools in their drive to raise attainment levels with their pupils. This is achieved by developing young peoples&#x27; levels of motivation, self-esteem and helping them to have a more positive attitude towards learning by concentrating particularly upon literacy, numeracy and the use of ICT.

Retired player, Frank Watene, leads Calderdale Community Coaching Trust which is the club&#x27;s Foundation providing a wide range of educational programmes designed to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles amongst people of all ages in the Calderdale area. Activities include Touch Rugby League, healthy heart circuit training and an &#x27;Over 50s Club which plays Kurling at the Shay stadium.

<text>Monique Bégin (March 1, 1936 – September 8, 2023) was a Canadian academic and politician.

== Early life ==
Bégin was born in Rome to a Canadian-born sound engineer Joseph Lucien Bégin (1895–1964) and Belgian-born accountant Marie-Louise Vanhavre (1906–1967) and raised in France and Portugal before emigrating to Canada at the end of World War II. She received an MA degree in sociology from the Université de Montréal and a PhD degree from the Sorbonne. She described her early life in Montreal as challenging, but credited community groups and her childhood role as a Girl Guides of Canada member as &quot;sav(ing) her life&quot;.

== Political career ==
In 1967, Bégin became executive secretary of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, which published its report in 1970. She won election to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal candidate in the riding of Saint-Michel in Montreal in the 1972 election. Bégin, Albanie Morin and Jeanne Sauvé, all elected in 1972, were the first women ever elected to the House of Commons from Quebec.

Bégin was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as Minister of National Revenue from 1976 to 1977, and served as Minister of Health and Welfare from 1977 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984 during which she introduced the Canada Health Act in Parliament which was passed by the House of Commons and is still in force today. She declined to run again in the 1984 election and retired from politics.

== Post-politics ==
In 1986, she joined the University of Ottawa and Carleton University as the first joint Ottawa-Carleton Chair of Women&#x27;s Studies. From 1990 to 1997, she was the University of Ottawa&#x27;s dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences and continued teaching as a professor emeritus. From 1993 to 1995, she also served as co-chair of Ontario&#x27;s Royal Commission on Learning with Gerald Caplan.

In 1997, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Bégin served as the Treasurer for the International Centre for Migration and Health.

In 2015, she was a recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case.

In 2018, she published the memoir &quot;Ladies, Upstairs!: My Life in Politics and After&quot;.

Bégin was elevated to a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2020.

==Death==
Monique Bégin died in Ottawa on September 8, 2023, at the age of 87.

==Electoral record==










== Archives ==
There is a Monique Bégin fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<doc id="1196376" wikidata="Q5093340" url="?curid=1196376" title="Chess pie">
<text>Chess pie is a dessert with a filling composed mainly of flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and sometimes milk, characteristic of Southern United States cuisine.

Jefferson Davis pie is similar to chess pie, but Jefferson Davis pie may also contain spices, nuts, or dried fruits and is usually topped with meringue.

==History==

It&#x27;s unknown where the name chess pie came from, although there are several well-known theories. The most likely is &quot;chess-cake pie&quot;, as in cheese cake pie, became chess pie over time. Martha Washington&#x27;s Chess Cake recipe is very similar to today&#x27;s chess pie. The 1881 cookbook &quot;Buckeye Cookery—With Hints on Practical Housekeeping&quot; included a recipe submitted by Mrs. J. Carson of Glendale, Minnesota. The recipe maintained the basic custard ingredients of eggs, butter, and sugar, but the egg whites were whipped into a meringue and spread on top.

One of the most popular theories is that it is an eggcorn of &quot;It&#x27;s just pie&quot; due to a misinterpretation of the pronunciation &quot;It&#x27;s jes&#x27; pie&quot; in Southern American English. The pie was thought to be so simple any home cook with eggs, butter and sugar would know what to do.

It is the South&#x27;s most searched for Thanksgiving Pie. Despite the pie&#x27;s iconic status in the South, no recipe for &quot;Chess Pie&quot; appears in the first Southern cookbook, Mary Randolph&#x27;s 1824 &quot;The Virginia Housewife&quot;. One food historian explains the early recipes for transparent pudding, such as &quot;Mary Randolph&#x27;s Transparent Pudding&quot; (containing no milk) in the 1825 edition are &quot;for all intents and purposes chess pie&quot;. Recipes for &quot;Chess Pie&quot; made without milk can be found in early 20th-century cookbooks.

Variations of the chess pie include transparent pie, molasses pie, brown sugar pie, syrup pie, and vinegar pie.

==Composition==
The basic chess pie recipe calls for the preparation of a single crust and a filling composed of flour, butter, sugar, and eggs and milk or condensed milk. Some variations call for the addition of cornmeal as a thickener. Many recipes call for an acid such as vinegar, buttermilk, or lemon juice.

Recipes dating from the 19th century typically including eggs, butter, sugar, and vinegar baked in a pie crust, with regional variations.

In addition to standard chess pie, other flavor variations include lemon, coconut, and chocolate chess pie. Some nut pies, including some pecan, fall under the category of chess pies. Traditional pecan pie recipes do not include milk or condensed milk in the filling, and are typically regarded as a type of sugar pie similar to British treacle rather than a milk-containing custard (see ).

<doc id="1196394" wikidata="Q14592146" url="?curid=1196394" title="John Newland Maffitt (privateer)">
<text>John Newland Maffitt (February 22, 1819 – May 15, 1886) was an officer in the Confederate States Navy who was nicknamed the &quot;Prince of Privateers&quot; due to his success as a blockade runner and commerce raider in the U.S. Civil War.

==Early life==
Maffitt was born at sea on a ship bound for New York City, his parents having emigrated from Ireland. Maffitt&#x27;s parents, Reverend John Newland Maffitt and his wife Ann Carnicke, settled with their son in Connecticut. When Maffitt was about five years old, he was adopted by his uncle, Dr. William Maffitt who traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with them, and moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina to live at the Ellerslie Plantation.

Maffitt was a slave owner, and sold Cornelia Williams Read in 1857. During the American Civil War, while commanding the Confederate States Navy cruiser , he was chased by the United States Navy steam frigate to Europe. On board &quot;Niagara&quot; was William B. Gould, who married Read after the war.

==United States Navy service==
Maffitt entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in February 1832, at the age of thirteen. He first served aboard USS &quot;St. Louis&quot; in the West Indies, and was later assigned to the Pensacola Navy Yard. In 1835 he was assigned to USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, serving as an aide to Commodore Jesse Elliott in the Mediterranean; his service aboard &quot;Constitution&quot; would later become the basis for a novel, &quot;Nautilus; or, Cruising under Canvas&quot;, published in 1871. He also served on the frigate USS &quot;Macedonian&quot;, becoming its acting Master in 1841.

Maffitt was ordered to the United States Coast Survey in 1842, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1843. He spent more than fourteen years in the hydrographic survey, chiefly in Nantucket, Massachusetts, Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. A channel in Charleston Harbor still bears his name.

In 1857, Maffitt was placed in command of the brig USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; and ordered to capture pirates and slavers in the West Indies. On August 21, 1858, &quot;Dolphin&quot; captured the slaver &quot;Echo&quot; with 318 Africans on board and sent her into Charleston; the liberated slaves were later sent back to Africa. Maffitt became commander of USS &quot;Crusader&quot; in 1859 and continued his assignment to suppress slavers in the West Indies until February 7, 1861.

==Confederate States Navy service==
In May 1861, with the coming of the U.S. Civil War, Maffitt resigned his U.S. Navy commission and became a First Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy. He served as a naval aide to General Robert E. Lee while preparations for the defense of Savannah were in progress. In early 1862, Maffitt was ordered to the civilian steamer &quot;Cecile&quot; to run the blockade with supplies for the Confederacy.

On August 17, 1862, he became the first commanding officer of the cruiser CSS &quot;Florida&quot;, taking her through a difficult outfitting period during which most of the ship&#x27;s company was stricken with yellow fever. While in port in Cuba, Commander Maffitt himself contracted the disease. In this condition, Maffitt sailed &quot;Florida&quot; from Cárdenas, Cuba to Mobile, Alabama. With the way into Mobile Bay blocked by Union warships, &quot;Florida&quot; braved a hail of projectiles from the blockaders and raced through them to anchor beneath the guns of Fort Morgan. The bombardment from the blockaders was severe and the damage to &quot;Florida&quot; was so great that Maffitt did not return to sea for more than three months. To prevent his escape, the Union Navy increased the blockading force near Mobile.

Having taken stores and gun accessories the ship lacked, along with added crew members, Maffitt waited for a violent storm before setting out on January 16, 1863. He used trickery to lose six pursuing blockaders. After coaling at Nassau, Bahamas, &quot;Florida&quot; spent 6 months off North and South America and in the West Indies, with calls at neutral ports, all the while making captures and eluding the large Federal squadron pursuing her. It was during this period that he acquired the nickname &quot;Prince of Privateers&quot; (which was somewhat inaccurate, since he was a naval officer and not an actual privateer.)

Maffitt was promoted to the rank of Commander in May 1863 &quot;for gallant and meritorious conduct in command of the steam sloop &quot;Florida&quot;.&quot; Ill health due to the lingering effects of yellow fever forced him to relinquish command of &quot;Florida&quot; at Brest, France on February 12, 1864.

In the summer of 1864, after returning to the Confederate States, Maffit was given command of the ironclad ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;. Under Maffit&#x27;s command, &quot;Albemarle&quot; dominated the Roanoke River and the approaches to Plymouth, North Carolina throughout the summer. In September, he was given command of the blockade runner CSS &quot;Owl&quot;. On October 3, &quot;Owl&quot; escaped to sea from Wilmington; the blockaders wounded her captain and several crewmen but 9 shots failed to stop them, and &quot;Owl&quot; arrived in Bermuda on October 24 with a large and valuable cargo of cotton. Maffit made several more successful runs through the Union blockade in &quot;Owl&quot; before the war ended.

During his service to the Confederacy, Maffitt repeatedly ran the blockade to carry needed supplies and captured and destroyed more than seventy prizes worth $10 to $15 million. Maffitt recognized the importance of a strong navy, for as he said, &quot;The grand mistake of the South was neglecting her navy&quot;.

==Later life==
At the end of the war, he refused to surrender his ship to the United States. Instead, he returned &quot;Owl&quot; to agents in Liverpool. He chose to remain in England, and, after passing the British naval examination, he served for about two years in command of the British merchant steamer &quot;Widgeon&quot; running between Liverpool and South America. He returned to the United States in 1868 and settled on a farm near Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1870, Maffit commanded a warship for Cuban revolutionaries during the Ten Years&#x27; War.

Maffit died in Wilmington in 1886, leaving an unfinished manuscript about piracy in the West Indies. His collected papers are in the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<doc id="1196405" wikidata="Q313426" url="?curid=1196405" title="Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria">
<text>Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria (Linz, 14 June 1529 – 24 January 1595, Innsbruck) was ruler of Further Austria and since 1564 Imperial count of Tyrol. The son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was married to Philippine Welser in his first marriage. In his second marriage to Anna Juliana Gonzaga, he was the father of Anna of Tyrol, future Holy Roman Empress.

== Biography ==

Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was the second son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary. He was a younger brother of Emperor Maximilian II.

He grew up in Innsbruck, where his father governed the Austrian hereditary lands on behalf of Ferdinand&#x27;s uncle Charles V.

Ferdinand was said to be the favorite son of his father. He was described by a visiting dignitary to court as &quot;handsome and friendlier&quot; than his brother Maximilian.

Ferdinand and his siblings were raised very strictly and given a thorough education. Among his teachers were Kaspar Ursinus Velius and Georg Tannstätter. Ferdinand and his brother were educated in languages, and other young noble boys were invited to court to be educated alongside the two archdukes. They were not to speak to them in German, only in Latin, Czech or other foreign languages.

Ferdinand was also instructed in the Catholic religion and their God-given right to rule, and that this was a gift based on the condition that they were to fear and love God.

At the behest of his father, he was put in charge of the administration of Bohemia in 1547. He also led the campaign against the Turks in Hungary in 1556.

In 1557, he was secretly married to Philippine Welser, daughter of a patrician from Augsburg, with whom he had several children. The marriage was only accepted by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1559 under the condition of secrecy. The children were to receive the name &quot;of Austria&quot; but would only be entitled to inherit if the House of Habsburg became totally extinct in the male line, and thus the marriage had many qualities of a morganatic marriage. The sons born of this marriage received the title Margrave of Burgau, an ancient Habsburg possession in Further Austria. The younger of the sons, who survived their father, later received the princely title of &quot;Fürst zu Burgau&quot;.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1564, Ferdinand became the ruler of Tyrol and other Further Austrian possessions under his father&#x27;s will. However, he remained governor of Bohemia in Prague until 1567, according to the wishes of his brother Maximilian II.

In his own lands, Ferdinand made sure that the Catholic Counter-Reformation would prevail. He also was instrumental in promoting the Renaissance in central Europe and was an avid collector of art. He accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose, making Ambras Castle the oldest museum in the world, and as the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle represents an unrivalled cultural monument. The collection was started during Ferdinand&#x27;s time in Bohemia, and he subsequently moved it to Tyrol. In particular, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities, the gallery of portraits, and the collection of armor were very expensive, leading Ferdinand to incur a high level of debt. Part of the collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

After the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married his niece, Anna Caterina Gonzaga, a daughter of William I, Duke of Mantua, in 1582.

Archduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595. Since his sons from the first marriage were not entitled to the inheritance, and the second produced only surviving daughters, Tyrol was reunified with the other Habsburg lands. His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became Empress Anna, consort of Mathias, Holy Roman Emperor, who received his Further Austrian inheritance.

==Children==

He and his first wife Philippine Welser were parents of four children:
* Margrave Andrew of Burgau (15 June 1558 – 12 November 1600). Became a cardinal in 1576, Margrave of Burgau in 1578, Bishop of Constance in 1589 and Bishop of Brixen in 1591. He had two illegitimate children.
* Charles, Margrave of Burgau (22 November 1560 – 30 October 1618), Margrave of Burgau. He married his first cousin, Sibylle (1557–1627), the youngest daughter of daughter of William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (28 July 1516 – 5 January 1592), and Maria, Archduchess of Austria, daughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. They had no legitimate children. He and his mistress Chiara Elisa di Ferrero had three illegitimate children.
* Philip of Austria (7 August 1562 – 9 January 1563), twin of Maria.
* Maria of Austria (7 August 1562 – 25 January 1563), twin of Philip.

On 14 May 1582, Ferdinand married his niece Anna Caterina Gonzaga. She was a daughter of William I, Duke of Mantua, and Eleonora of Austria, younger sister of Ferdinand. They were parents to three daughters:
* Archduchess Anna Eleonore of Austria (26 June 1583 – 15 January 1584).
* Archduchess Maria of Austria (16 June 1584 – 2 March 1649), a nun.
* Archduchess Anna of Austria (4 October 1585 – 14 December/15 December 1618); married her first cousin Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor.

He had at least two illegitimate children:

With Anna von Obrizon:
*Veronika von Villanders (1551–1589). Married Giovan Francesco di Gonzaga-Novellara, Lord of Campitello.

With Johanna Lydl von Mayenburg:
*Hans Christoph von Hertenberg (c. 1592 – 2 September 1613). Married Ursula Gienger.

<text>An urban oasis is a public open space, park, or plaza which is located in between buildings or formed by surrounding buildings in an urban setting. It can exist in any kind of culture. There are various sizes of urban oases. Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s park in New York City, can be considered as a very large urban oasis. The Los Angeles Central Library’s plaza can be considered to be a small scaled oasis.

The oasis is used by residents, workers, and visitors during everyday activities. The urban oasis offers many benefits to the community by inviting people to stop, sit, eat, play, and relax. Plant material provides shade and screens the noise of vehicular traffic while fountains help to drown out the noise pollution. The oasis adds value to cities and neighborhoods while providing identity, economic benefit, environmental benefit, and a site for cultural activities in cities.

==Role in the community==
Identity is one of the most significant roles of an urban oasis. Great public icons like Rockefeller Center&#x27;s ice-skating rink, and Central Park’s woodlands, open fields, and fountains are good examples of identifiable places in New York City. Both are well known and visited often, allowing tourists and residents to take advantage of an urban oasis.

Another role of the urban oasis is to provide economic benefit to the community. Land values in a city are considerably affected by parks and surrounding attractions. The highest land values in New York City tend to be around Bryant Park, Central Park, and Gramercy Park. The green-market has been a major catalyst in revitalizing the surrounding neighborhoods. Parks revitalize streets for walking, gathering, and shopping and provide economic benefits to a city.

Plaza-like urban oasis features provide settings for cultural activities like farmers&#x27; markets, art galleries, and music events. They not only provide for cultural activities, but plazas also provide economic activity to the communities. One good example is the WaterFire night event in Providence, Rhode Island. During the summer and early fall, bonfires are placed just above the surface of the three rivers that pass through the middle of downtown Providence, which give out pleasing smells of aromatic wood. This, combined with live music, creates a public cultural event that brings people into a central urban area after dark while engaging the senses and emotions of those who stroll the paths and bridges of Waterplace Park.

==Environment==
Environmental benefits including the perception of a landscape as naturally beautiful, increasing plant reliability and decreasing costs, improving planting success, richer living environment, or preventing habitats, are gained from urban oases. Our appreciation of the natural environment is enhanced by vegetative parks that add open spaces and create animal and bird habitat areas. Central Park is a significant example, as it lends enormous environmental benefits to New York City.

<text>Sir [[Chaudhry]] Mohammad Zafarullah Khan (6 February 1893 – 1 September 1985) was a Pakistani diplomat and jurist who served as the first foreign minister of Pakistan. After serving as foreign minister he continued his international career and is the only Pakistani to preside over the International Court of Justice. He also served as the President of the UN General Assembly. He is the only person to date to serve as the President of both UN General Assembly and the International Court of Justice.

Khan became one of the most vocal proponents of Pakistan and led the case for the separate nation in the Radcliffe Commission which drew the countries of modern-day South Asia. He moved to Karachi in August 1947 and became a member of Pakistan&#x27;s first cabinet serving as the country&#x27;s debut foreign minister under the Liaquat administration. He remained Pakistan&#x27;s top diplomat until 1954 when he left to serve on the International Court of Justice and remained on the court as a judge until 1958 when he became the court&#x27;s vice president. He left the Hague in 1961 to become the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations, a position he served until 1964.

Before he served in The UN he fought for Palestinian Interest thus it made him a hero well respected by the Arab Masses. In 1963, he became president of UN General Assembly State of Palestine in a &quot;de facto&quot; capacity. He left the UN in 1964 to return to the ICJ and, in 1970, he became the first and only Pakistani to serve as the President of the International Court of Justice, a position he maintained until 1973. He returned to Pakistan and retired in Lahore where he died in 1985 at the age of 92. Khan is considered a prominent figure in Pakistan. He authored several books on Islam both in Urdu and English.

==Family and early life==

===Family===

Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan was born on 6 February 1893 in the City of Sialkot in Sialkot District. His family were Zamindars of Sahi Jat extraction based around Daska and were of the headman of their village the other being a Sahi Sikh Sardar. Khan&#x27;s family had suffered a decline during the Sikh era due to government favoritism towards Sikhs and the early death of his Great Grandfather which resulted in his grandfather, Chaudhry Sikandar Khan to become the village headman in his adolescence. However, over time, Chaudhry Sikander Khan regained much of the family&#x27;s status and became a widely respected around Daska. Sikandar Khan&#x27;s son and Zafarullah Khan&#x27;s father, Chaudhry Nasrullah Khan became part of the first wave of Landed Gentry of Sialkot to receive a western education and became one of the most prominent lawyers of Sialkot district. Both of his parents were deeply religious members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim movement.

Khan&#x27;s mother, Hussain Bibi, belonged to a well to do Zamindar family hailing from the Bajwa tribe of Jats. She was his father&#x27;s maternal first cousin. Hussain Bibi and Zafarullah Khan were incredibly close and Khan called her the most powerful influence in his life. Hussain Bibi was deeply religious and was known for her exceptionally firm belief in God. Hussain Bibi had lost her first two children in their infancy. Relatives thought it was because she had refused to give offerings demanded by Jai Devi, a self acclaimed village witch, who villagers thought delved in black magic. They urged her to appease Jai Devi, however, Hussain Bibi bluntly refused even after mounting pressure from the family after the second infant&#x27;s death. Arguing that she would gladly give charity to Jai Devi but since Jai Devi had claimed to control her infants ability to live or die she could not as it violated her faith. Stating that it would be tantamount to Shirk as only Allah controlled who lived or died.

===Education===

He studied at Government College, Lahore and received his L.L.B. from King&#x27;s College London in 1914. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London. He practised law in Sialkot and Lahore, became a member of the Punjab Legislative Council in 1926.

==Career==

Muhammad Zafarullah Khan practiced law in Colonial India. He was the counsel for the Ahmadiyya cause in two landmark judgements. In 1916, the Patna High Court gave a verdict on the case &quot;Hakim Khalil Ahmad Vs. Malik Israfil&quot; which gave Ahmadis the right to use religious places of Islam for prayers. In 1922, the Madras High Court acknowledged Ahmadiyya as being a part of Islam in its verdict on the case &quot;Narantakath Avullah v. Parakkal Mammu&quot;.

Zafarullah was elected a member of the Punjab Legislative Council in 1926 and presided at the Delhi meeting of the All-India Muslim League in 1931, where he advocated the cause of the Indian Muslims through his presidential address. He participated at the Round Table Conferences held from 1930 to 1932 and became the Minister of Railways in May 1935. In 1939, he represented India at the League of Nations. He was appointed the Agent General of India in China in 1942 and represented India as the Indian Government&#x27;s nominee at the Commonwealth Relations Conference in 1945, where he spoke on India&#x27;s cause for freedom.

From 1935 to 1941, he was a member of the Executive Council of the Viceroy of India. Sir Zafarullah Khan prepared a note on the future of the dominion status of India analyzing the future prospects of the &quot;Dominion Status&quot;. It took into account concerns of Muslims and ultimately proposed a plan to divide the subcontinent. This note was sent to Lord Zetland, Secretary of State for India, as referred in a letter by Lord Linlithgow dated 12 March 1940.

Lord Linlithgow, however, had not a complete grasp of contents in the analytic note prepared by Sir Zafarullah Khan at the time it was sent to the Secretary of India. A copy of this note was sent to Jinnah. Sir Zafarullah Khan&#x27;s proposal of a two-state solution for the Indian Federation was adopted by the Muslim League with a view to give it full publicity in the forthcoming session at Lahore 22–24 March.

In September 1941, Zafarullah Khan was appointed a Judge of the Federal Court of India, a position he held until June 1947. At the request of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, he represented the Muslim League in July 1947 before the Radcliffe Boundary Commission and presented the case of the Muslims in a highly commendable manner. Zafarullah Khan advised the Nawab of Junagadh that if he decided to join his state with Pakistan, it would be both moral and legal. The Nawab then proceeded to announce his decision.

In October 1947, Zafarullah Khan represented Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly as head of the Pakistani delegation and advocated the position of the Muslim world on the Palestinian issue. On October 28, he was appointed chairman of Subcommittee 2 of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question upon the resignation of the previous chairman. That year, he was appointed Pakistan&#x27;s first Foreign Minister, a post he held for seven years. Between 1948 and 1954, he also represented Pakistan at the United Nations Security Council where he advocated for the liberation of occupied Kashmir, Libya, Northern Ireland, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Indonesia.

As Foreign Minister, he represented Pakistan at the Manila Treaty Conference in September 1954. Support for the Manila Pact in Pakistan was divided, with West Pakistan dominated army and a handful of leaders in favour of this, while most elected members of the Constituent Assembly from West Pakistan and all of the Assembly members from East Pakistan opposed it. Zafarullah signed the Manila Pact, committing to Pakistan&#x27;s accession to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).

In 1954, he became a Judge at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, a position he held until 1961. He was the vice-president of the International Court of Justice from 1958 to 1961. Between 1961 and 1964, he was Pakistan&#x27;s Permanent Representative at the United Nations. From 1962 to 1964, he was also the President of the UN General Assembly. He later rejoined the ICJ as a judge from 1964 to 1973, serving as president from 1970 to 1973.

In 1982, the first ever Provisional World Parliament (PWP) met in Brighton, U.K. at the Royal Pavilion was presided over by him.

==Religion==

As an Ahmadi, Zafarullah Khan held the office of Ameer (president) of the Lahore, Pakistan chapter of the Community from 1919 to 1935. He served as Secretary to Khalifatul Masih II, the second successor of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, at the &quot;Majlis-e-Shura&quot; (Consultative Council) for the first time in 1924, and continued to do so for 17 more sessions. In addition, he was a member of the delegation which represented the Ahmadiyya Community at the All Parties Conference held in 1924. In 1927, he acted successfully as representative counsel for the Muslims of the Punjab in the contempt of court case against the &quot;Muslim Outlook&quot;.

As Pakistan&#x27;s first Foreign Minister, Zafarullah Khan addressed the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan in the days leading up to the passing of the Objectives Resolution. The Objectives Resolution, which combined features of both Western and Islamic democracy, is one of the most important documents in the constitutional history of Pakistan. It was designed to provide equal rights for all citizens of Pakistan, regardless of their race, religion or background. Zafarullah Khan was quoted as saying:

In March 1958, Zafarullah Khan performed Umrah and, at the same time, visited the shrine of Muhammad in Medina, Saudi Arabia. During his visit, he met with the King of Saudi Arabia Saud of Saudi Arabia, and stayed at the Royal Palace as a personal guest of the King. In 1967, he returned to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj, a religious duty that must be carried out at least once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to do so.

==Legacy==

Khan&#x27;s legacy has been hailed and his paramount role in the creation of Pakistan has been celebrated in the history of Pakistan. He is popularly known by his title Sir Zafarullah Khan, and openly acknowledged that he belonged to the Ahmadiyya Community. He was selected by Muhammad Ali Jinnah as the first Foreign Minister of Pakistan. He was one of the most influential, skilled, and passionate diplomats of his time.

In a personal tribute, King Hussein bin Tallal of Jordan said:

Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali, a former Prime Minister of Iraq, in a tribute on his death, wrote:

<doc id="1196425" wikidata="Q3437854" url="?curid=1196425" title="Rock music in Italy">
<text>Italian rock is a form of rock music produced primarily in Italy. The music genre has roots in the country as it spread in the early 1960s from the United States with the earliest versions of rock and roll during this period being cover versions or interpretative covers of already existing songs.

==History==

===1960s and 1970s===
The first distinctively Italian singer-songwriter was Piero Ciampi, whose style was reminiscent of the French chansonniers. The United States and United Kingdom during the 1960s were in the midst of the psychedelic rock boom, which inspired Italian psychedelic bands such as Mario Schifano and Le Orme. At the time of the 1968 student uprisings, many young and educated Italians began to identify with the counterculture in France, Mexico, the US and across the world. Young Italians still had a well-educated familiarity with classical music composers like Bach. The result was an influx of classically influenced rock bands which fit right into the international move towards progressive rock. Italian progressive bands include: 
*Banco del Mutuo Soccorso 
*Celeste
*Devil Doll 
*Goblin
*Jacula 
*Latte e Miele 
*New Trolls 
*Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM)
*Reale Accademia di Musica 
*Saint Just
*Le Orme

Some bands, like Osanna, Area, Perigeo and Arti &amp; Mestieri (Arti e Mestieri), fused progressive rock with jazz, fusion and world music. Il Balletto Di Bronzo&#x27;s &quot;YS&quot; is one of the most debated Italian prog-rock albums; Some calling it trash and others extolling it as one of the greatest progressive albums ever made. Another important album of the time was &quot;Arbeit macht frei&quot; by Area. They merged agit-prop lyrics, jazz-rock jamming, raw electronics, middle-eastern scales and psychotic warbling, creating an original mixture of different music styles. Area were fronted by Demetrio Stratos, one of the most original singers of his age, who recorded experimental albums entirely devoted to the human voice such as &quot;Cantare la Voce&quot;. The same period, the early 1970s, also saw the rise of Italian singers and songwriters like Lucio Battisti, Fabrizio De André, Franco Battiato, Paolo Conte and Francesco Guccini.

By the end of the 1970s, Italian punk and comedy rock pioneers Skiantos had released 1978&#x27;s &quot;Monotono&quot;, which kickstarted the Italian punk scene. Later bands like The Confusional Quartet and Gaznevada fused new wave and Italian varieta with punk and other influences.

===1980s===
In the 1980s, Italy boasted one of the most vibrant new wave, hardcore and thrash metal scenes. In the late 1980s, more extreme heavy metal bands appeared. Of these bands include:

*Afterhours
*Ataraxia
*CCCP Fedeli alla linea
*Diaframma
*Kirlian Camera
*Litfiba
*Monumentum
*Necrodeath
*Negazione
*Opera IX
*Raw Power
*Vanadium
*Vasco Rossi
*White Skull

===1990s and beyond===

In the 1990s, Italian avant-garde, alternative rock and metal bands gained international notoriety, at least among critics. In general, the sonic model was a mixture of Big Black, Sonic Youth and Fugazi, while the themes coined a sort of neo-existentialism, very much concerned with the psychodramas of ordinary kids. Italy, the homeland of melodic music, turned out to be one of the major international centers for post-rock. Gianna Nannini in the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s was the first Italian rocker who achieve real popular success outside of Italy, especially in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Benelux and later in Mexico. While Francesco De Gregori was well appreciated by critics and well-informed fans outside of Italy it was Nannini who was first Italian pop icon to stick and to shift between pop and rock with ease and to stay the course through trends and upcoming generations. Zucchero, Eros Ramazzotti and Jovanotti (later: Nek and Laura Pausini) all went on to become huge international pop names in the late 1980s and 1990s.

Other artists to emerge in the 1990s and beyond include:

<doc id="1196436" wikidata="Q7309663" url="?curid=1196436" title="Regulation of Railways Act 1889">
<text>The Regulation of Railways Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 57) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is one of the Railway Regulation Acts 1840 to 1893. It was enacted following the Armagh rail disaster.

==Safety==
It empowered the Board of Trade to require any railway company to:

* adopt the block system of signalling on any passenger railway;
* provide for the interlocking of points and signals on such railways;
* provide for and use on all passenger trains continuous brakes; the brakes must be instantaneous in action; self applying in the event of any failure in continuity; capable of being applied to every vehicle of the train; and in regular use in daily working.

Provision was made to enable the railway companies to issue debentures to pay for the capital cost of the equipment.

There were also provisions regarding reporting the number of persons in safety-related employment who worked more than a specified number of hours.

==Tickets==
The Act also requires passengers to show tickets and to pay a penalty if travelling without a ticket. It also gives powers to agents of the railway to request a name and address and to make it an offence not to provide these details when requested. Prosecutions are still brought under the Act today.

===Misuse of the Act===

Several rail companies from 2020 privately prosecuted cases of alleged fare evasion under the Act using the Single justice procedure (SJP), whereby a lay magistrate can try cases without a court hearing. However, the SJP cannot be used for the 1889 Act, and in August 2024 the UK&#x27;s chief magistrate declared six test cases as void, as the process should never have been used. This led to plans to void over 74,000 other similar cases. At least some of the prosecutions were clearly not intentional evasion, which could not be tested in the SJP procedure; for example a man prosecuted for trying to pay a £3.50 fare at his destination as the ticket machine at the station he boarded from was not working, and there was no guard on the train.

<doc id="1196439" wikidata="Q2478169" url="?curid=1196439" title="A Little South of Sanity">
<text>A Little South of Sanity is a live album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released on October 20, 1998, by Geffen Records. The two-disc album features recordings taken while the band was on the Nine Lives Tour, which began in 1997 and was still ongoing at the time of the live album release, and the Get a Grip Tour, which the band was on tour with from 1993 to 1994.

This release was the only Aerosmith album to receive the Parental Advisory sticker, primarily due to lead singer Steven Tyler shouting profanities in between songs and modifying some song lyrics to racier ones, although some other song lyrics had profanity in their original studio versions as well.

== Production ==
Shortly after the band reunited in 1984, they signed a contract to generate six albums for Geffen. Three of these, the studio releases &quot;Done With Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, and &quot;Pump&quot;, were finished before Aerosmith agreed to a contract with Columbia Records in 1991. The contract was not due to take effect until after Aerosmith&#x27;s obligations to Geffen were fulfilled, but after the 1993 album &quot;Get a Grip&quot; was released, the band did not record another studio album for the label. Instead, a compilation of their hits from the Geffen era, titled &quot;Big Ones&quot;, was put together and plans for a live album were conceived as Aerosmith went to Columbia.

== Artwork ==
Filmmaker Patrick Connolly claims that he inspired, and is depicted on, the album cover. As a teenager, Connolly was the gas station attendant for Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer when Kramer&#x27;s Ferrari caught fire while refueling. At the time of the incident and for a time after, Joey Kramer was convinced that the fire was Patrick Connolly&#x27;s fault. Connolly maintains that the album&#x27;s cover, released in October 1998, features an image of a gas attendant who bears a resemblance to a teenage Connolly. He is convinced that the album cover artwork was intended to mockingly blame him for the July 15, 1998 incident. The fire was later found to be caused by a defective fuel line in the vehicle&#x27;s gas tank.

== Live sources ==
There are no official listings to support where or when each performance was culled from; the CD booklet only mentions they were recorded during the Get a Grip and Nine Lives world tours. However, the recordings of &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; each have Tyler calling out to the live crowd, revealing where they were recorded. The first song has him mentioning the crowd in State College, Pennsylvania, the second a crowd in West Palm Beach, Florida, and the third a crowd in Seattle, Washington.

<doc id="1196449" wikidata="Q706439" url="?curid=1196449" title="Sinshih District">
<text>Sinshih District (), alternatively spelled Xinshi, is a rural district in central Tainan, Taiwan, about 11 km north of Fort Provintia. As &quot;Sincan&quot;, it was one of the most important stations of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the 17th century. Missionary work formally began and the largest amount of inland trade occurred at Sinkan.

==Name==
The village name of Sincan has also been recorded as Sinckan, Cinckan, Xincan, and Zinckan. The place shares the same namesake as the Sinckan language and Sinckan Manuscripts. After the Kingdom of Tungning, the name was Sinicized into &quot;Sin-kang&quot; ().

==History==
Located about north of Sakam (see Fort Provintia), &quot;Sinkan&quot; was one of the most important stations of the Dutch during the 17th century. &quot;Sinkan&quot; was the smallest of four main aboriginal villages near the Dutch base at Tayouan, with around 1,000 inhabitants. This fact led them to seek friendship and protection from the Dutch; Sinkan was the VOC&#x27;s closest ally. During the governorship of Pieter Nuyts, Sinkan unsuccessfully pursued protection from Tokugawa Iemitsu.

In 1861 Consul Robert Swinhoe arrived at Taiwan-fu (modern-day Tainan) and became the first European writer to come into contact with the Taiwanese aborigines after Maurice Benyovszky in 1771. Swinhoe wrote that he was informed by a &quot;thoroughly Chinese-looking&quot; military officer that his ancestor was one of 3,000 Dutch soldiers remaining in the island during the reign of Koxinga (and after Dutch rule), and that his village of Sinkang was chiefly composed of the soldiers&#x27; descendants.

Sinshih Township was created in 1945 as part of Sinhua District, Tainan County. In 1946, Sinshih Township was transferred to direct administration by Tainan County and in July, the villages of Dashe and Tanding, originally part of Shanshang, were transferred to the administration of Sinshih Township.

The former Sinshih District Office at No. 3, Jhongsing Street was demolished in 1983. The current Sinshih District Office at No. 12, Jhongsing Street was completed in March 1984.

On December 25, 2010, Tainan City and County were merged. At the same time, Sinshih Township was renamed as Sinshih District.

In May 2019, the Taiwan Power Company announced plans to build a large solar energy power facility in Tainan. At that time, the Tainan city government had recently finished a bidding process to determine contracts in several areas including Sinshih District for roof-top solar power generation.

==Geography==
* Area: 49.51 km2
* Population: 35,883 people (January 2016)

==Administrative divisions==
The district consists of Xinshi, Xinhe, Shenei, Dazhou, Fenghua, Sanshe, Daying, Dashe, Tanding, Gangqi and Yongjiu Village.

==Economy==
Part of Tainan Science Park, which was founded in 1996, lies within Sinshih.

<doc id="1196453" wikidata="Q14707787" url="?curid=1196453" title="William Howard Taft High School (New York City)">
<text>William Howard Taft High School is a former New York City high school in the southwest section of the Bronx, whose building now houses small specialized high schools. The school was operated by the New York City Department of Education.

The Taft school campus is located on Sheridan Avenue and 172nd Street in the Bronx.

== History ==
Founded in the 1940s, Taft originally served the largely homogeneous population of the surrounding area. In the post-war years of the forties, fifties and sixties. Notable graduates included director Stanley Kubrick, producer Jerry Weintraub, novelist Judith Rossner, and singers Eydie Gormé, Chuck Negron, Luther Vandross, Alan Merrill and Joanna Russ.

Demographic and the advent of specialized magnet schools brought about shifts in enrollment. During the Abraham Beame (1974–1977) and Edward Koch (1978–1989) administrations, citywide, crime rates were high and unfavorable publicity accelerated the decline of the school. By the early 1970s, Taft H.S. earned a reputation as a &quot;failing school&quot; with many of the problems of other high schools in poor, marginalized neighborhoods in New York City.

Entering the 1990s, as a non-selective high school, it was unable to compete with the newer schools housing magnet programs that attracted prime students from throughout the borough. Crime intimidated vibrant young professionals from teaching at the high school. The danger was highlighted in May 1997, when Jonathan Levin, an English teacher at the school and the son of former Time Warner chairman Gerald M. Levin, was murdered by a former student in his Manhattan apartment.

Of the 629 students attending Taft in the 1990s, the majority were Hispanic and African-American. On any given day, attendance hovered around 86%. The impoverished community, lacking in political clout or a cohesive PTA, was provided 10 truancy officers, rather than improved education strategies. The last graduating class of Taft High School was in June 2008.

== Transformation ==
Within the same building, the previously identified &quot;failing school&quot; has been transformed into a series of small specialized high schools to meet modern career needs. The specialty schools are:

* Bronx Collegiate Academy (formerly Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School)
* Claremont International High School
* DreamYard Preparatory School
* Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications
* The Urban Assembly Academy for History and Citizenship for Young Men
* New Directions Secondary School

==History==
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School opened in 1967. The building was designed by the firm of Eggers &amp; Higgins. It was built for $7.571 million, and it was designed for a capacity of 3,213 students. In 1968, the Queens Chamber of Commerce gave Cardozo High School an award for excellence in design and civic value.

In March 1970, the Black Students Union gave Principal Benjamin Michaelson a list of ten requests. The students wanted Black History and Art to be added to the curriculum, they wanted several racist teachers to be fired, and they wanted to have more input on which classes they took. They also wanted more teachers who were black, as there was only one at that time. The following month, the students had a sit in. A week later, twelve members of the Black Students Union met with Michaelson about the list. When Michaelson tried to postpone the discussion to another time, the students would not allow Michaelson to leave the office and prevented others to enter the room. The principal&#x27;s assistant called the police, and four students were arrested.

In March 1992, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton met with Cardozo students and answered their questions. He returned in January 1998 and helped paint classrooms in Cardozo, along with many volunteers from Americorps.

Students of the school took to the athletic field in October 2013 to fight cuts to AP science and math classes.

<text>In healthcare, an orderly (also known as a ward assistant, nurse assistant or healthcare assistant) is a hospital attendant whose job consists of assisting medical and nursing staff with various nursing and medical interventions. These duties are classified as routine tasks involving no risk for the patient.

==Job details==

Orderlies are often utilized in various hospital departments. Orderly duties can range in scope depending on the area of the health care facility they are employed. For that reason, duties can range from assisting in the physical restraint of combative patients, assisting physicians with the application of casts, transporting patients, shaving patients, and providing other similar routine personal care to setting up specialised hospital equipment such as bed traction arrays.

Orderlies are typically found in emergency departments, operating rooms, psychiatric wards, long-term care facilities, and orthopaedics departments.

Orderlies are described as nonlicensed hospital assistants who are instructed to perform delegated functions under the direct supervision of a licensed practitioner in the healthcare setting.

In the United States, orderlies have been phased out of healthcare facilities in recent years, their functions having been replaced by patient care assistants and certified nursing assistants.

Orderlies in United Kingdom hospitals were known as &quot;attendants&quot; (primarily in lunatic asylums), but that role has been phased out. The nearest role left to a male hospital assistant is that of porter, but that is more a logistical role, moving patients and equipment around the hospital. This is not to be confused with healthcare assistants, who are essentially carers for patients (not qualified or licensed health care professionals), and may be of both sexes.

A common setup among hospitals in Australia is seen at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. At the RAH, the orderly service is contracted to Spotless, a national corporation. There are around eighty orderlies employed by Spotless at the Royal Adelaide alone. They are tasked with the movement of patients and equipment between wards and departments, the movement of patients from ambulances in triage, the movement of patients from MedStar retrieval helicopters that land at the hospital, the movement of deceased patients to the mortuary, and various other tasks. They respond to every medical emergency team call that originates within the hospital to provide extra oxygen and so that the patient is able to be moved to another area (such as the intensive care unit) as soon as is required. Some orderlies are stationed in particular departments, but most remain in the &quot;pool&quot; and are dispatched throughout the hospital. 

In The Royal Brisbane and Womans Hospital in Queensland, orderlies known as patient support officers not only handle patients but are also required to do all cleaning within the hospital.

<text>Peter Michael Pitfield (June 18, 1937 – October 19, 2017) was a Canadian Senator and senior civil servant.

Pitfield was the youngest son of the Canadian financier Ward C. Pitfield and Grace MacDougall Pitfield, daughter of Canadian ice hockey player Hartland MacDougall. His brother, Ward C. Pitfield Jr., was Chairman of the family Investment Banking firm, Pitfield, MacKay, Ross, which later merged with Dominion Securities, now the investment arm of the Royal Bank of Canada. Another brother, stockbroker Robert Hartland Pitfield (d. 2004), was father-in-law of former Toronto city councillor Jane Pitfield. His nephew, Ward Elcock is the former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and former Deputy Minister at the Department of National Defence (Canada).

== Biography ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, Pitfield graduated from St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, at the age of 16. His SLU degree, in science, was followed by a degree in law from McGill University. He went to Ottawa to join the civil service in 1959 where he worked as an administrative assistant to Justice Minister E. Davie Fulton.

Pitfield subsequently obtained a postgraduate degree in public law, and held various positions in the civil service. In 1966, he became assistant secretary to the Privy council and in 1969 secretary of the Division of planification. He became Clerk of the Privy Council of Canada and Secretary to the Cabinet under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1980 to 1982. Because of his perceived close association with Trudeau and the Liberals, he was replaced during the ministry of Joe Clark, but returned following the 1980 election that returned Trudeau to power.

The diplomat John G. H. Halstead described Pitfield as an &quot;evil influence&quot; on the Trudeau government, describing him as a schemer who was always seeking to promote his own interests at the expense of others by preventing other officials from having access to Trudeau. Halstead accused Pitfield as having thrown Canadian foreign policy into chaos by creating a gratuitously convoluted bureaucratic structure that caused much bureaucratic in-fighting as a way to enhance his power.

As head of the public service, Pitfield played a senior role in the government&#x27;s successful efforts to patriate the Canadian Constitution. In recognition of his service, he was appointed to the Canadian Senate as an independent at Trudeau&#x27;s recommendation on December 22, 1982. The appointment was controversial and seen as emblematic of the growing financial, partisan and cultural issues surrounding the Ottawa civil service.

Pitfield served from the mid-1980s until 2002 as vice chairman of Power Corporation, and then was Director Emeritus of the company.

Pitfield&#x27;s two decades of service to the University of Ottawa Heart Institute Foundation were recognized by the establishment of the Michael Pitfield Chair in Cardiac Surgery at the Institute. In later years, he developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease and worked to raise awareness of the condition.

Pitfield resigned from the Senate on June 1, 2010.

He fathered three children (Caroline, Thomas and Kate) before his death on October 18, 2017, and was predeceased by his wife Nancy in 1999. He lived in Westmount, Quebec, for many years. His daughter-in-law Anna Gainey is now a Member of Parliament.

<text>Walter Peeler, (9 August 1887 – 23 May 1968) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. He was decorated following his actions during the Battle of Broodseinde in October 1917. Then a lance corporal in the Australian Imperial Force, he repeatedly took the lead in the 37th Battalion&#x27;s advance on well-defended German positions, destroying four machine gun posts and killing more than 30 German soldiers during the battle.

Born near Castlemaine, Victoria, Peeler worked at various jobs in his home town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916. Posted to the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, he arrived on the Western Front during November. In June 1917, his battalion participated in the assault on Messines ridge, where he was lightly wounded. Eight days after his Victoria Cross action, Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm and spent the next seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom. Following the armistice with Germany, he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918.

Peeler re-settled with his family in Victoria, and was appointed the inaugural custodian of Melbourne&#x27;s Shrine of Remembrance in 1934. In May 1940, Peeler enlisted for service in the Second World War, understating his age by fourteen years to avoid the upper age limit imposed on volunteers. He was posted to the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and initially saw action in the Syria–Lebanon campaign. However, with the entry of Japan into the war, his unit was one of the first sent to the Netherlands East Indies in early 1942. The unit arrived in Sumatra and was disembarking when it was diverted to Java where it assisted in the Dutch defence of the island. When Dutch resistance collapsed in March, allied forces in Java signed a formal surrender with British, Australian and American troops becoming prisoners of war. After three-and-a-half years as prisoner of war, Peeler was freed in August 1945 and returned to Australia in October, resuming his duties at the Shrine of Remembrance. He retired in 1964 and, aged 80, died at his home in South Caulfield in 1968.

==Early life==
Walter &quot;Wally&quot; Peeler was born at Barker&#x27;s Creek, near Castlemaine, Victoria, on 9 August 1887. He was the eighth child of William Peeler, a farmer and miner, and his English-born wife Mary Ellen (née Scott). As a youth Peeler worked in his parents&#x27; orchard, before gaining employment with Thompson&#x27;s Foundry in Castlemaine. On 10 July 1907, he wed Emma Hewitt; the couple were to have five children. An active sportsman, Peeler was a member of the Castlemaine Cricket Club and, briefly, secretary of the Wesley Hill Football Club.

==First World War==
By 1916, Peeler was living in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond with his wife and three daughters. On 17 February, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. Posted as a private soldier to the machine gun section of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, Peeler underwent his initial training in Victoria, before departing from Melbourne headed for England aboard HMAT &quot;Wandilla&quot; on 6 June. The battalion arrived in Plymouth seven weeks later. During the three months Peeler&#x27;s unit spent in England undergoing additional training, he was charged with being absent without leave for six hours on 3 July, and fined a day&#x27;s pay. He was nevertheless promoted to lance corporal on 6 November.

Two weeks later, the 3rd Pioneer Battalion was posted to the Western Front. Sent to the Armentières sector, the battalion spent several months working on trench and railway construction. In mid-December, Peeler attended a week-long course at the Machine Gun School in Le Touquet, and in early 1917, accompanied the battalion north in preparation for the upcoming Messines offensive. However, on 8 May 1917, one month before the offensive, Peeler found himself the subject of a court-martial in the field. Following an incident that occurred during a training session on 26 April, he was charged with &quot;careless and negligent handling of a Lewis Gun whilst instructing&quot; that led to &quot;grievous bodily injury&quot; to Private John Martin Fife. Found guilty of the charge, Peeler was stripped of his lance corporal stripe.

On 7 June 1917, Peeler participated in the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a Lewis gun during the action, he was injured twice, suffering shrapnel wounds to his face and eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.

===Victoria Cross===
As part of the third stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer&#x27;s Passchendaele offensive, an attack against Broodseinde was scheduled for 4 October 1917. The 3rd Australian Division&#x27;s 10th Australian Infantry Brigade was one of the assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion&#x27;s machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade&#x27;s 37th Battalion.

The attack on Broodseinde began at 06:00 under the cover of an artillery barrage. Armed with a Lewis Gun, Peeler advanced with the initial wave. The Australians rapidly crossed the first before becoming pinned down by a party of nine German soldiers, who were situated in a shellhole and sniping at the advancing troops. Firing his machine gun from the hip, Peeler dashed forward across the exposed ground and shot the group of Germans, &quot;clearing the way for the advance&quot;. He performed similar feats on two subsequent occasions, killing several German soldiers and emerging unscathed.

The Australian force continued to press their assault, encountering pillboxes and machine gun positions as they pushed forward. One such machine gun position, situated in the open, held up the advance. Firing a single burst from his Lewis Gun, Peeler killed the gunner and caused the remainder of the gun&#x27;s defenders to seek cover in a nearby dugout. One of the Australians then lobbed a &quot;well aimed&quot; grenade into the dugout, driving out ten soldiers whom Peeler then shot. Described as being &quot;particularly prominent in the advance&quot; by historian Charles Bean, Peeler &quot;almost single-handedly&quot; destroyed four German posts in an hour, accounting for more than 30 soldiers.

By 07:15 the following morning, the 37th Battalion had captured its objective, having seized eight pillboxes, several concrete dugouts, 20 machine guns and 420 prisoners. Two hours later, the Australians were in possession of Broodseinde Ridge. For his actions during the battle, Peeler was awarded the Victoria Cross; one of two Australians to be so decorated that day. On 12 October, eight days after Peeler&#x27;s actions, the men of the 10th Brigade returned to the front line in an effort to exploit the success of the previous week. The ground in front of their position was dominated by a series of German pillboxes and had been turned into a quagmire by heavy rain. The brigade&#x27;s attack was soon subject to a &quot;torrent of machine gun fire&quot;, and Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm. Initially evacuated to the 11th Australian Field Ambulance casualty station, it was decided that his wound necessitated treatment in England so he embarked for the Northampton War Hospital on 15 October, arriving the following day.

While recuperating in England, the announcement and accompanying citation for Peeler&#x27;s Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 26 November 1917, reading:

===Recuperation and repatriation===
As news of Peeler&#x27;s decoration spread, it prompted a &quot;wave of celebrations&quot; in his hometown of Castlemaine; flags flew in his honour, and one of his daughters was cheered by fellow pupils at her school. On 8 January 1918, Peeler was formally conferred with his Victoria Cross by King George V in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Having sufficiently recovered from his wound, Peeler rejoined the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in France on 17 May; he was promoted to temporary corporal two weeks later.

On 22 June 1918, Peeler was posted to the Corps Gas School for eight days. He was promoted to sergeant on 30 July. Around this time, Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes invited Australia&#x27;s Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive. Among the group who accepted the offer, Peeler was one of ten who embarked for Melbourne aboard HMAT &quot;Medic&quot; on 24 August, arriving in Melbourne seven weeks later. He would not return to France; on 11 November 1918 an armistice with Germany was declared, effectively ending the war. Peeler was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 10 December.

==Inter-war years==
Following his discharge, Peeler gained employment with the soldier-settler branch of the Victorian Department of Lands. He remained with the department for six years, before acquiring an orchard in the Castlemaine district. However, this venture proved short-lived and he soon returned with his family to Melbourne, joining the H.V. McKay Sunshine Harvester Works at Sunshine. Also on the company&#x27;s staff was a fellow Victoria Cross recipient, Dominic McCarthy. When Melbourne&#x27;s Shrine of Remembrance was completed in 1934, Peeler was appointed as the memorial&#x27;s first custodian. He occupied this post for next 30 years, coming to regard the Shrine as &quot;his second home&quot;.

==Second World War==
===Enlistment and Syrian Campaign===

On 27 May 1940, Peeler enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force for service in the Second World War, giving his date of birth on his enlistment forms as 9 August 1901, thus understating his age by fourteen years. At 52, Peeler was twelve years over the maximum age limit, although he later claimed he was not the &quot;oldest fellow in my unit&quot;. Granted the acting rank of sergeant, he was allotted to the newly raised 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion. The battalion completed its initial training at Puckapunyal,&lt;ref name=&quot;2/2nd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; during which time Peeler was made acting staff sergeant and Company Quartermaster Sergeant of D Company on 1 August.

On 7 April 1941, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion embarked aboard HMT &quot;Queen Mary&quot; at Sydney, bound for the Middle East; Peeler&#x27;s rank of staff sergeant was confirmed as substantive on the same day. After just under four weeks at sea, the troopship disembarked at Port Tewfik in Suez, where the battalion entrained for Palestine. There it was attached to the 7th Division in support of the Syrian campaign against Vichy French forces.

The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was initially divided up, with each company attached to a different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler&#x27;s D Company—assigned to the 25th Brigade—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area in an effort to prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a costly assault against the Vichy French at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July.

After the Vichy French defeat in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was relocated to Tripoli, Lebanon where it headquartered itself in an olive grove while carrying out training and garrison duties over the next four months. During November, the battalion was moved to Qatana in Syria, but with the entry of Japan into the war in late 1941, the 1st Australian Corps including the 6th and 7th Divisions were directed to move to the Netherlands East Indies for service in the Pacific theatre. In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard HMT &quot;Orcades&quot; for Sumatra but later diverted to Java. He was promoted to Warrant Officer Class II during this time.

===Defence of Java and prisoner of war===
The 1st Australian Corps with the 6th and 7th Division were moving from the Middle East to Dutch East Indies. Sailing far ahead of the 7th Division ships, the fast liner &quot;Orcades&quot; with 3400 men including the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion without its heavy equipment, reached Sumatra at midday of 15 February. &quot;Orcades&quot; was disembarking troops just hours before the fall of Singapore when ordered to reembark troops and divert from Sumatra to Batavia in Java. Disembarking at Batavia on 18 February, Peeler&#x27;s battalion was combined with the other units aboard &quot;Orcades&quot; to form Blackforce. This ad hoc grouping, under the command of fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier Arthur Blackburn, was tasked with defending a series of airfields and supporting the Dutch. Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation, consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions—the men of the 2/2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce&#x27;s 2nd Battalion.

On 28 February 1942, elements of the Imperial Japanese Army landed on Java. Blackforce was stationed at Buitenzorg, poised to advance west to confront the invaders. However, rapid Japanese progress pushed the defending Dutch forces in the opposite direction, and Blackforce was assigned the defence of Buitenzorg and Leuwiliang. As the situation deteriorated further, Blackburn was forced to withdraw his men east on the night of 4/5 March, and again on 7/8 March. On 8 March, the Dutch surrendered, ordering all men to lay down their arms. With supplies running low and unable to contact the Australian Government, Brigadier Blackburn announced the surrender of Blackforce four days later. Peeler and his fellow soldiers thus became prisoners of war. At the time, he was one of three Australian Victoria Cross recipients of the First World War serving overseas, all of whom were &quot;swept up in the Japanese advance&quot;; Blackburn surrendered with Peeler at Java, while Walter Brown was caught up in the fall of Singapore, where he is believed to have been killed attempting to evade capture.

Peeler was among a contingent of Australian captives transported to work on the Burma Railway. Despite the &quot;harsh treatment&quot; meted out by the Japanese, he later played down his ordeal, stating: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t treated too badly, apart from nearly starving ... But what the Japs did to the others on the railway was pretty horrifying&quot;. After three-and-a-half years incarceration, he was freed following the Japanese capitulation in August 1945 and the subsequent liberation of prisoner-of-war camps in the Pacific. On 6 October, Peeler embarked for Australia aboard HMS &quot;Highland Brigade&quot;; he arrived in Melbourne fifteen days later. Back in Australia, he learned that his son, Donald, by his second marriage, had been killed in action on the island of Bougainville on 31 December 1944, while serving with the 15th Battalion. Donald Peeler was posthumously mentioned in dispatches for his &quot;distinguished service in the South-West Pacific Area&quot;. Warrant Officer Class II Walter Peeler was discharged from the Second Australian Imperial Force on 12 December 1945.

==Later life and legacy==
Peeler resumed his duties as custodian of the Shrine of Remembrance on his discharge, guiding visitors around the memorial. In the 1961 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, his &quot;long and dedicated service&quot; at the Shrine was recognised with the award of the British Empire Medal. He retired three years later at the age of 76, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s time I had a rest.&quot; In 1966, Peeler was interviewed for a newspaper article; when queried on his Victoria Cross exploit, he recalled:


Peeler died at his home in South Caulfield, Victoria, on 23 May 1968. Survived by his second wife, Kathleen, and his four remaining children, he was buried in Brighton Cemetery. Kathleen died the following year. Peeler is commemorated in the Victorian Garden of Remembrance, and a soldiers&#x27; club in Casula, New South Wales, bears his name. His Victoria Cross and other medals are on display in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

<text>Ricardo Álvarez-Rivón (born c. 1950) is the creator of &quot;Turey el Taino&quot;, Puerto Rico&#x27;s most successful locally produced comic book-magazine.

==Early life==
Álvarez-Rivón, who drew comics since his childhood years, was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and studied art and drawing in the University of Puerto Rico. Álvarez-Rivón wanted to come up with a different concept in comics, a comic which would entertain as well as educate children and adults alike. He then worked on an idea about a Taino and his adventures.

==Turey el Taino==
On October 26, 1989, &quot;Turey el Taino&quot;, published by Editorial Manos, made its debut in the news and magazine stands in stores all over Puerto Rico. &quot;Turey el Taino&quot; is what is known as a &quot;comic magazine&quot;. Instead of the regular comic format, this comic comes in the form of a magazine. It was first printed in black and white. Turey is a lovable chubby guy with two sons and a very dominating wife. Turey goes on all kinds of adventures, accompanied by his best friend &quot;Batu&quot;, the tribe witchdoctor &quot;Baracutey&quot; and &quot;Tureycito&quot;, one of his sons. They either face the &quot;ferocious&quot; Caribs or fight evil spirits. The comic book is education-oriented, as it teaches how the Tainos must have lived before the arrival of the Spaniards. The comic book also contains a section where the letters and drawings from the fans are published. The first newspaper to publish the adventures of Turey was &quot;El Mundo&quot; of Puerto Rico. Soon, the adventures of Turey were being published in color in the Sunday newspaper pages of &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;.

==Recognitions and honors==
The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture honored &quot;Turey&quot; by publishing a book on the character, which included a collection of the comic strips. &quot;Turey&quot; is also the principal figure on an educational pamphlet published by &quot;ENDE&quot; (&quot;El Nuevo Día Educador&quot;). The U.S. Postal Service honored &quot;Turey el Taino&quot; and his creator in 1999, by presenting a cancelled postal stamp and renaming the postal station in &quot;Plaza Las Americas&quot; in Puerto Rico, the &quot;Turey Postal Station&quot;.

On November 10, 1999, The Puerto Rican House of Representatives, honored &quot;Turey&#x27;s&quot; creator Ricardo Álvarez-Rivón and presented him with a plaque. Álvarez-Rivón continues to write and illustrate the &quot;Turey&quot; comic strips with the collaboration of his wife, Magali Álvarez-Rivón.

<doc id="1196520" wikidata="Q1970025" url="?curid=1196520" title="Space Crusade">
<text>Space Crusade is an adventure board game produced by Milton Bradley together with Games Workshop and was first made in 1990. It was produced in the UK and available in some other countries including Finland, Ireland, France, Spain, Denmark, Australia, Hellas and New Zealand. In Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, it is known as Star Quest.

It is a sister game to &quot;HeroQuest&quot;, which was also produced by Milton Bradley and Games Workshop. It uses many of the concepts of the Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Space Hulk&quot; and &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; games, but at a much simpler level of game play.

The game was designed by Steven Baker. The original box artwork was by Jim Burns, and the later edition had a cover by David Sque.

==Gameplay==
The game is designed to be played with 2 to 4 players, taking turns until one wins. One player takes the role of the aliens, controlling all the aliens and monsters on the space hulk, which were a mixture of Chaos, Orks, Genestealers and other aliens from &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. The alien player takes on a significantly reduced role compared with that of a Game Master in traditional role-playing games, with its sole role being to stop the marine players from accomplishing their missions.

The other players are marine players, and each controls a squad of 5 Space Marines in standard power armour, one of whom is a Commander. Each squad is further equipped with order commands as well as equipment cards. Marines can be armed with different weapons: light weapons allow marines to move faster at the cost of reduced firepower. Heavy weapons operate in special ways, such as being able to hit all units in a horizontal line, or attacking multiple targets.

The blue squad represents the Ultramarines, the red squad represents the Blood Angels, and the yellow squad represents the Imperial Fists. All three are founding chapters of the Space Marines, and the chapter can be recognized by the insignia on the slider board, and accurately represents the standard colors of the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; versions. Each of the chapters are identical, although the equipment cards for the Blood Angels are specialised in close combat, and the Imperial Fists in use of ranged heavy weapons.

Close range combat rules are enforced when two units engaging are next to each other; the controlling player of the two units in combat roll whatever number of dice allowed for that unit, and the highest wins. Otherwise, ranged combat rules are followed so long as there is line of sight between the two squares that each unit is occupying: the firing player rolls dice for the weapon being fired, and if the die total is above the armour value of the target, it is dealt hit points.

The squad-based system gives each player greater access for strategy and planning. Most of the game is careful calculations of avoiding line of sight, and rushing to attack either from around the corridor, through open doors, or close in with close combat. The mission based system sometimes allows a player to sacrifice units to score points in order to win.

The marine players have the advantage of heavy weapons, special equipment and high armour point values due to their power armour, while the alien player has the advantage of large numbers of pieces and random &quot;Alien Event&quot; cards which may be detrimental to his opponents. The marine Commanders have multiple hit points and special weapons, making them harder to kill.

Each game consists of the marine players receiving their primary mission, docking and entering the space hulk (and later dreadnought factories), completing their mission before the other marine players, and returning their team back to the docking claw. Points are scored for units killed and missions completed, deducted for units lost. Players with sufficient points at the end of the game (including the Alien Player) can be promoted to the next rank, which gives them access to additional order or equipments for the subsequent games.

== German Edition ==
The German version of the game was published under the name &quot;StarQuest&quot; to tie-in with &quot;Hero-Quest&quot;, which, at that time, was very popular amongst German children.

Due to the country&#x27;s stricter censorship laws (see Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons), the translation tones down most of the violent game elements: The aliens are &quot;chaos robots&quot;, not living creatures. A player does not kill a robot, the robot is merely removed from this dimension or gets caught by the effects of the weapons and is not harmed at all. Although for example the &quot;Assault Cannon&quot; can quite easily be recognized as a type of machine gun, in the German version it is called &quot;Zero Time Gun&quot; and its effect is explained as &quot;time bubbles&quot; slowing down the enemy.

==Expansion games and sequels==

===&quot;Eldar Attack&quot;===
A boxed expansion set that introduced Eldar with special abilities including psychic powers.

This expansion pack allowed one extra player to control the Eldar miniatures, thus allowing the game to be played by 2-5 people.

===&quot;Mission Dreadnought&quot;===
A boxed expansion set.

This expansion pack gives the marine player access to additional space marine miniatures, boosting the squad to 6 space marines and the commander. Space marines may carry extra heavy weapons or the tarantula mobile turret.

The alien player gains extra heavy dreadnoughts, which are extremely powerful and capable of wiping out an entire squad. The last mission in the additional mission book allows the alien player to continuously construct additional dreadnoughts for more firepower from the dreadnought factory board.

The additional bulkhead doors and corridor tiles allow players to build more interesting board constructions, whereas the initial game is quite limited to either the square 2x2 mode or the long 4x1 mode.

===&quot;White Dwarf&quot;===
Two articles about &quot;Space Crusade&quot; were published in &quot;White Dwarf&quot;: one for using Terminators, Space Marine Scouts, Ork Mobs, Tyranids and Genestealer Hybrids (&quot;White Dwarf 134&quot;, 1991), allowing players to use &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; miniatures, and one campaign called &#x27;Renegade&#x27; (&quot;White Dwarf 145&quot;, 1992).

===&quot;Advanced Space Crusade&quot;===
&quot;Advanced Space Crusade&quot; was a modular board game published in 1990 by Games Workshop. The premise of the game is that a number of Space Marine scout squads are boarding a Tyranid ship in order to sabotage its delicate internal &quot;organs&quot;. The game is superficially similar to &quot;Space Hulk&quot; in that it uses 28 mm plastic Citadel Miniatures as play pieces, uses modular board pieces to represent the innards of the Hive ship, and has one player controlling the Marines while the other controls waves of Tyranids, but has no greater relationship to &quot;Space Crusade&quot; than any other game set in the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe. Without the license from Milton Bradley, many of the components of &quot;Advanced Space Crusade&quot; were released in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Tyranid Attack&quot;, a substantially different game.

==Video game==

Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. released the &quot;Space Crusade&quot; video game version of the game in early 1992. It was available on Atari ST, IBM PC (MS-DOS), Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad and later received an expansion, &quot;The Voyage Beyond&quot;. It is considered a faithful conversion of the boardgame, with a board that could be viewed in 2D or isometric projection views (Barker, 1992). The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 24 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="1196523" wikidata="Q3437827" url="?curid=1196523" title="Rock music in Denmark">
<text>Danish rock is rock music played in Denmark. Starting in the 1950s, rock music was inspired by the United States of America, where it was becoming extremely popular, although records could be difficult to obtain in the country. Danish jazz artists began adopting the rock genre. Towards the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Danish rock was heavily influenced by British music, one of the genres being R&amp;B. By the late 1960s, Danish rock was again influenced by American rock. During the 1980s, the Danish rock consisted mainly of pop-rock bands, until the rock subgenre grunge broke through to the mainstream in the 1990s. In the late 1990s and early 21st century Indie rock was very popular.

==Historical development==
While American rock and roll music was influential, it remained difficult to obtain in Denmark in the 1950s; Elvis Presley records were not officially released there until 1958. This left ample room for both Danish and British artists to gain mindshare.

Danish jazz and dance bands and soloists like Ib Jensen, Otto Brandenburg, Peter Plejl and Ib Glindemann brought the style to Danish listeners. At the end of the decade, the English band The Shadows was a major influence on the first pioneers of the era, The Cliffters and The Rocking Ghosts.

In the early 1960s, British R&amp;B and beat bands inspired Danish counterparts like The Hitmakers, Sir Henry &amp; His Butlers, The Defenders and The Beefeaters, as well as the breakthrough band Steppeulvene, whose 1967 LP &quot;Hip&quot; revolutionized the field of Danish rock by fusing American folk rock. Young Flowers was the first rock trio; some of their songs were in Danish language, but several others were adaptions of Walt Whitman lyrics. Alrune Rod and Savage Rose were among the popular bands in Denmark throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Still, Danish rock and pop music in those days resembled more of German schlager than American or British rock. Jazz bands like Blue Sun, Burnin Red Ivanhoe, Secret Oyster and Maxwells also moved towards rock. At the close of the decade, much of the rock world was incorporating sociopolitical lyrics, along with the rise of the counterculture. Denmark&#x27;s contribution to this field included Gasolin, Gnags, Jomfru Ane Band and Røde Mor.&lt;br&gt;
Among middle-aged and older Danes, schlager-resembling Danish folk rock was gaining popularity those days, chiefly artists like John Mogensen, Otto Brandenburg and Kim Larsen.

By the 1980s, however, pop-rock bands like Sneakers, Anne Linnet, Sebastian and Lis Sørensen were popular, alongside punk-influenced Miss B. Haven, TV-2, Sort Sol and Kliché. Best selling was the cowpunk band, D-A-D, who in the late eighties turned into a Ronnie James Dio inspired Heavy Metal band. The following decade saw the rise of pop bands like Michael Learns to Rock, Safri Duo and Aqua, guitar rock bands like Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, Kashmir and Psyched Up Janis.

The current Danish rock scene is dominated by indie influences in bands such as The Raveonettes, and Mew. Other popular Danish rock groups include Iceage, Sort Sol (Black sun), VETO, Figurines, Kira and The Kindred Spirits, Carpark North, Saybia, Tim Christensen, The Floor Is Made of Lava and the Danish folk metal band Svartsot. Some hard rock bands to come out of Denmark are Volbeat, Red Warszawa, Mercenary, Mercyful Fate (later King Diamond), Artillery, Pretty Maids, Freak of Nature / Mike Tramp (former singer of White Lion) and Royal Hunt. For alternative rock, Cryoshell started out in affiliation with LEGO, gaining it some market. A popular newer Danish band is Nephew, who play a blend of indie and electro rock and utilize a mixture of Danish and English lyrics.

Famous Danish rock musicians are among other Lars Ulrich, the drummer and co-founder of Metallica, and Mike Tramp, the vocalist and co-songwriter of White Lion.

More extreme Danish metal bands include Mnemic, Illdisposed, Illnath, Corpus Mortale, Panzerchrist, Konkhra, Hatesphere, Marodium, Nortt and Iniquity.

==Festivals==
The annual Roskilde Festival is held in Danish city of Roskilde. The festival is the second-largest in Europe with ticket sales normally running from 70,000 to 100,000. The festival has featured many prominent artists (mainly rock), such as Nirvana, Guns N&#x27; Roses, U2, Bob Dylan, Black Sabbath and Green Day, and there has also been an emphasis on world music, alternative genres and Danish music at the festival. In 2000, the festival suffered a terrible accident during a Pearl Jam concert where 9 people were crushed by the wild crowds, making security a primary issue of the following festivals. The festival has since avoided any other incidents of this kind.

<text>César Augusto Guzzetti (6 September 1925 – 1988) was an officer in the Argentine Navy who rose the rank of vice admiral. After the 1976 coup d&#x27;état that overthrew the government of Isabel Perón, Guzzetti became the first foreign minister of the military government presided by Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla.

Guzzetti was appointed as foreign minister on 30 March 1976. In October of that year he met with Henry Kissinger, the United States Secretary of State, who expressed support for the new military government of Argentina and its efforts to root out leftist insurgents (&quot;Dirty War&quot;). On 7 May 1977, operatives of the leftist guerrilla group Montoneros ambushed Guzzetti in a hospital waiting room in Buenos Aires, shot him in the head, and left him for dead. Guzzetti received extensive medical treatment and survived, but he was left mute and quadriplegic. On 27 May he was replaced as foreign minister by another vice admiral, .

<doc id="1196541" wikidata="Q3437841" url="?curid=1196541" title="Rock music in France">
<text>French rock is a form of rock music produced in France, primarily with lyrics in the French language.

French rock was born as early as mid-1950s, when writer, songwriter and jazz player Boris Vian wrote parody rock songs for Magali Noël or Henri Salvador. Although Vian despised rock and wrote these songs as attacks, they are highly acclaimed by French critics today and considered precursors.

The first real French rock acts emerged at the end of the decade and in the beginning of the 1960s, with Johnny Hallyday achieving the most long-lasting success, while other acts like Les Chaussettes noires, led by other French rock star Eddy Mitchell, and Les Chats sauvages (led by Dick Rivers) contributed to the emergence of the genre, the last band writing the first real classic French rock song, &quot;Twist à Saint-Tropez&quot;. The emergence of the yé-yé movement slowed the commercial success of French rock, although some names like Antoine, Jacques Dutronc, Nino Ferrer and Michel Polnareff emerged in the middle of the 1960s and did have success, while others like Ronnie Bird or Les Variations (who are commonly considered forerunners of French hard rock) achieved cult status.

In the 1970s, France saw the arrival of rock bands such as Téléphone, and Alan Stivell&#x27;s Breton folk-rock as well as a wave of progressive rock bands like Ange, Afterlife, Bottom Blues, Magma, Gong (whether they are actually a French band is debatable), Triangle, Dynastie Crisis, Shylock, Eskaton, Atoll and Pulsar. There was also some glam rock acts, like The Frenchies or the controversial and cult artist Alain Kan. Jacques Higelin&#x27;s album &quot;BBH 75&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t fit in these categories and is more of a transitional album between the classic era rock sound (à la Rolling Stones) and punk rock, is considered a seminal milestone by French critics, while ex-yé-yé star Christophe became a successful pop-rock artist, especially with his seminal albums &quot;Les Paradis perdus&quot; and &quot;Les Mots bleus&quot; (which title song is considered a major classic). French punk rock also appeared, including bands like Starshooter, Stinky Toys, Asphalt Jungle, Electric Callas, Oberkampf and Métal Urbain. It was during this period that variety music artists - like Catherine Ribeiro, Bernard Lavilliers and others - flirted with rock, but without completely changing over. However, French singer Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s 70s output, which included the classic &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot;, the less accessible &quot;L&#x27;Homme à tête de chou&quot; and the reggae &quot;Aux armes et cætera&quot;, transitioned completely from chanson to rock (a move he started earlier in the 1960s) and offered French-language rock new classics. Another name to know is that of Gérard Manset, a cult artist who deliberately live in maintained obscurity, but whose ballad &quot;Il voyage en solitaire&quot; is a major song and progressive album &quot;La Mort d&#x27;Orion&quot; is a reference, and who has continued to collaborate with high-profile artists up to this day. French hard rock and heavy metal took off by the end of the decade, spearheaded by Trust.

Things changed course in the 1980s with the arrival of the left in power. The notable changing of the political culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture. This helped the emergence of a distinct French rock that could match the lucrativeness of American and British rock music and bands. French progressive rock continued in the 1980s in relative obscurity, with the bands Dün, Minimum Vital, Terpandre and Emeraude achieving some underground success (but were met with critical indifference). The success of Téléphone (pub rock), which started in the 1970s but peaked in the 1980s, also took French rock to new levels. The new wave was dominated by Indochine, who sold enormously, as well as the romantic Alain Chamfort, overshadowing the works of critical darlings Taxi Girl or Jacno, but the genre also later saw the emergence of Étienne Daho, who would remain a major figure in French music up to this day. Another notable artist from the early 1980s is Axel Bauer, who scored a massive hit with the song &quot;Cargo&quot;. Charlélie Couture also marked its time with &quot;Comme un avion sans aile&quot;. The post-punk scene, although commercially unsuccessful, also featured critically acclaimed acts, such as Marquis de Sade, Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine, Orchestre rouge or Kas Product. The art rock band Les Rita Mitsouko enjoyed international success, while the decade also saw the emergence of Alain Bashung, who had been around since the 1960s but only started to have his first hits in the new wave era. Bashung would become the most critically acclaimed French rock singer in his home country, with several of his albums being now hailed as classics. There was also a second wave of French punk rock which included such acts as Lucrate Milk, Bérurier Noir, Ludwig Von 88, Les Shérifs, Les Négresses Vertes, Les Garçons Bouchers, Les Wampas, Les Satellites or the seminal Mano Negra, which would make the genre evolve towards worldbeat (and whose leader Manu Chao would later have a worldwide successful solo career). The first major French indie rock act appeared: Les Thugs, who are considered a major reference of the scene up to this day. Finally, French hard rock and heavy metal really took shape in this decade, with the continuing success of Trust or that of other bands like ADX, Warning, Shakin&#x27; Street, Sortilège or Vulcain, and some early thrash-death metal acts like Agressor, Loudblast or Morsüre.

The 1990s, still dominated by Bashung&#x27;s aura and output (including &quot;Osez Joséphine&quot; and the major classic &quot;Fantaisie militaire&quot;), also saw the emergence of Noir Désir (their first classic album, &quot;Veuillez rendre l&#x27;âme (à qui elle appartient)&quot; dated back from the late 80s), whose sound fitted well in the grunge movement, and their 1992 album &quot;Tostaky&quot; was a huge popular and critical success, still selling solidly decades after its release. French rock was dominated by punk (No One Is Innocent), funk (-M-, FFF, Sinclair) and Noir Désir-soundalikes like Aston Villa or Saez (a trend which would continue in the 2000s with Luke, Eiffel or Déportivo, for instance). The very popular Louise Attaque refined the Noir Désir sound to fit a more indie folk approach, which would still allow them to achieve enormous sales. More on the indie scene, Diabologum and later its offshoots Expérience and Programme would become leaders, with a sound influenced by Pavement&#x27;s approach. Other notable artists include Dominique A and Miossec who would sport a more minimalistic approach, pop bands Billy ze Kick et les Gamins en Folie, Les Innocents or L&#x27;Affaire Louis&#x27; Trio, and post-rock band Kat Onoma. Pop-rock artists Alain Souchon, Laurent Voulzy and Francis Cabrel, although they had been around since the 1970s, enjoyed major commercial success during this period. French heavy metal saw the emergence of the cult black metal scene of the Légions Noires with Vlad Tepes, Mütiilation, Belkètre or Torgeist and other acts not associated with it like Blut Aus Nord and Belenos, and some nu metal acts on the course of the decade, including Mass Hysteria, Lofofora, Eths or Pleymo.

The 2000s would see, alongside bands still influenced by Noir Désir, a dilution of the rock sound, with acts like Benjamin Biolay or Phoenix incorporating rock in their music, while being closer to chanson for the former (in a Dominique A-influenced approach) and French touch for the latter. Other chanson-affiliated artists flirting with rock include Jeanne Cherhal, Keren Ann, La Grande Sophie, Camille, Anaïs, Cali, Raphael, Bénabar and ex-Les Innocents leader J. P. Nataf, and artists more specifically influenced by Biolay include Florent Marchet, Arman Méliès, Bertrand Belin and Albin de la Simone. It also saw the reemergence of ex-new wave patriarchs Indochine as an emo-influenced band, with their album &quot;Paradize&quot; selling enormously and becoming a new classic. The decades-old French heavy metal would enjoy an international emergence, with acts like Gojira or AqME, while the underground black metal scene would keep on striving with bands like Deathspell Omega, Peste Noire or the more experimental Alcest. On the indie rock scene, Dionysos would become extremely popular with their hit &quot;Song for Jedi&quot; from their best-seller &quot;Western sous la neige&quot;, while other acts like A.S. Dragon or Ultra Orange would have more confidential success. Indie acts Yelle and M83 would achieve most of their success abroad. The second half of the decade would see the emergence of a French garage rock revival scene, with BB Brunes, Plastiscines, the Cheeraks, Crash Normal, the Normals, Naast, Izïa, Alister, Mademoiselle K or Stuck in the Sound.

In the 2010s, notable acts include the art rock/new wave outfit La Femme and Christine and the Queens, and electro-rock band Shaka Ponk also started to achieve major hits, alogside bands such as Skip The Use. Other notable acts include indie rock band Frànçois &amp; the Atlas Mountains (who were active since 2005 but started to obtain critical acclaim this decade, although achieving most of their success abroad), Britpop-influenced Archimède, pop artist Arnaud Fleurent-Didier, art rock band Moodoïd, and Gnawa-inspired combo Bab L&#x27; Bluz. Following in the footsteps of their big brothers from the 70s, some militant and/or culturalist groups like Les Ramoneurs de Menhir and Matmatah also enjoyed great success, particularly in their region of origin, French Brittany.

<doc id="1196543" wikidata="Q1456851" url="?curid=1196543" title="Oprah's Book Club">
<text>Oprah&#x27;s Book Club was a book discussion club segment of the American talk show &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, highlighting books chosen by host Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey started the book club in 1996, selecting a new book, usually a novel, for viewers to read and discuss each month. In total, the club recommended 70 books during its 15 years.

Due to the book club&#x27;s widespread popularity, many obscure titles have become very popular bestsellers, increasing sales in some cases by as many as several million copies. Al Greco, a Fordham University marketing professor, estimated the total sales of the 70 &quot;Oprah editions&quot; at over 55 million copies.

The club has seen several literary controversies, such as Jonathan Franzen&#x27;s public dissatisfaction with his novel, &quot;The Corrections&quot;, having been chosen by Winfrey, and the incident of James Frey&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;, being outed as almost entirety fabricated. The latter controversy resulted in Frey and publisher Nan Talese being confronted and publicly shamed by Winfrey in a highly praised live televised episode of Winfrey&#x27;s show.

On June 1, 2012, Oprah announced the launch of Oprah&#x27;s Book Club 2.0 with &quot;&quot; by Cheryl Strayed. The new version of Oprah&#x27;s Book Club, a joint project between and &quot;O, The Oprah Magazine&quot;, incorporates the use of various social media platforms and e-readers.

On March 25, 2019, Apple Inc. and Oprah announced a revival of Oprah&#x27;s Book Club that aired on Apple TV+.

==History==
The book club&#x27;s first selection on September 17, 1996, was the then recently published novel &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; by Jacquelyn Mitchard. Winfrey discontinued the book club for one year in 2002, stating that she could not keep up with the required reading while still searching for contemporary novels that she enjoyed. After its revival in 2003, books were selected on a more limited basis (three or four a year).

Winfrey returned to fiction with her 2007 selections of &quot;The Road&quot; by Cormac McCarthy in March and &quot;Middlesex&quot; by Jeffrey Eugenides in June. Shortly after its being chosen, &quot;The Road&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Winfrey conducted the first ever television interview with McCarthy, a famously reclusive author, on June 5, 2007.

The October 2007 selection was &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, a 1985 novel by Nobel Prize laureate Gabriel García Márquez, greatly furthering not only the influence of the author in North America, but that of his translator Edith Grossman. Another work by Márquez, &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, was a previous selection for the book club in 2004.

The last club selection was a special edition of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. It had disappointingly low sales figures.

==Influence==
In &quot;Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America&quot;, Kathleen Rooney describes Winfrey as &quot;a serious American intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and the Internet, to take reading—a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act—and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of non-readers to pick up books.&quot;

&quot;Business Week&quot; stated:
Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that Jon Stewart of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot; could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include Fox News&#x27;s Sean Hannity, National Public Radio&#x27;s Terry Gross, radio personality Don Imus, and CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. But no one comes close to Oprah&#x27;s clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.

In 2009, it was reported that the influence of Winfrey&#x27;s book club had even spread to Brazil, with picks like &quot;A New Earth&quot; dominating Brazil&#x27;s best-seller list.

The club generated so much success for some books that they went on to be adapted into films. This subset includes &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; and &quot;The Reader&quot;.

At the show&#x27;s conclusion in May 2011, Nielsen BookScan created a list of the top-10 bestsellers from the club&#x27;s final 10 years (prior data was unavailable). The top four with sales figures as of May 2011:

#Eckhart Tolle, &quot;A New Earth&quot; (2005), 3,370,000 copies
#James Frey, &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;, 2,695,500 copies
#Elie Wiesel, &quot;Night&quot;, 2,021,000 copies
#Cormac McCarthy, &quot;The Road&quot;, 1,385,000 copies

In a 2014 paper by economist Craig L. Garthwaite published in &quot;American Economic Journal: Applied Economics&quot;, it was reported that while the book club increased sales of individual titles in the list, it caused a short-term overall decrease in sales for the book industry as a whole after each selection was announced. Since Oprah&#x27;s selections were longer and more difficult classics that demanded greater time and energy to read, those people who were reading Oprah&#x27;s books were not buying their usual fare of genre books: &quot;there were statistically significant decreases for mysteries and action/adventure novels. Romances also saw a sales decline,&quot; following an Oprah endorsement. In the 12 weeks following an endorsement, &quot;weekly adult fiction book sales decreased by a statistically significant 2.5 percent.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The club has received critical commentaries from the literary community.

Scott Stossel, an editor at &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, wrote:

==Controversies==
=== Jonathan Franzen ===
Jonathan Franzen felt conflicted about his book &quot;The Corrections&quot; being chosen as a book club selection. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being in the company of other Oprah&#x27;s Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had &quot;picked some good books, but she&#x27;s picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think she&#x27;s really smart and she&#x27;s really fighting the good fight.&quot; Franzen added that his novel was a &quot;hard book for that audience.&quot;

Following the criticism Franzen was uninvited from the televised book club dinner, and he apologized profusely. When Franzen was not invited back, he suggested that perhaps he and Winfrey could still have dinner but not on TV, but Winfrey was all booked up, and her spokesperson said she was moving on.

Other writers were critical of Franzen. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, author Verlyn Klinkenborg suggested that &quot;lurking behind Mr. Franzen&#x27;s rejection of Ms. Winfrey is an elemental distrust of readers, except for the ones he designates.&quot; Author Andre Dubus III wrote that, &quot;It is so elitist it offends me deeply. The assumption that high art is not for the masses, that they won&#x27;t understand it and they don&#x27;t deserve it – I find that reprehensible. Is that a judgment on the audience? Or on the books in whose company he would be?&quot;

In 2010, Oprah chose another of Franzen&#x27;s books, &quot;Freedom&quot;, for her book club. She said that after she read a copy of the book Franzen had sent her with a note, she called the author and gained his permission. Oprah said, &quot;we have a little history this author and I&quot;, but called the book &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, and according to an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, she &quot;seems to have forgiven the bestselling author after their 2001 kerfuffle&quot;.

=== James Frey ===

In late 2005 and early 2006, Oprah&#x27;s Book Club was again involved in controversy. Winfrey selected James Frey&#x27;s &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; for the September 2005 selection. &quot;Pieces&quot; is a book billed as a memoir—a true account of Frey&#x27;s life as an alcoholic, drug addict, and criminal. It became the Book Club&#x27;s greatest selling book up to that point, and many readers spoke of how the account helped free them from drugs as well. But the additional attention focused on Frey&#x27;s memoir soon led to critics questioning the validity of Frey&#x27;s supposedly true account, especially regarding his treatment while in a rehabilitation facility and his stories of time spent in jail. Initially, Frey convinced Larry King that the embellishments in his book were of a sort that could be found in any literary memoir; Winfrey encouraged debate about how creative non-fiction should be classified, and cited the inspirational impact Frey&#x27;s work had had on so many of her viewers. But as more accusations against the book surfaced, Winfrey invited Frey on the show to find out directly from him whether he had lied to her and her viewers. During a heated live televised debate, Winfrey forced Frey to admit that he had indeed lied about spending time in jail, and that he had no idea whether he had two root canals without painkillers or not, despite devoting several pages to describing them in excruciating detail. Winfrey then brought out Frey&#x27;s publisher Nan Talese to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book&#x27;s veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey&#x27;s staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as &quot;brutally honest&quot; in a press release.

The media commented on the televised showdown. David Carr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs.&quot; &quot;Oprah annihilates Frey,&quot; proclaimed Larry King. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Maureen Dowd wrote, &quot;It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into Swift boating and swift bucks, into W.&#x27;s delusion and denial, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying,&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Richard Cohen was so impressed by the confrontation, that he crowned Winfrey &quot;Mensch of the Year.&quot;

<text>Nar Nar Goon railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Nar Nar Goon, in Victoria, Australia. Nar Nar Goon station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 1 April 1881.

==History==
In 1953, the line between Nar Nar Goon and Tynong was duplicated. In 1954, the line to Pakenham was duplicated, electrification of the line between Pakenham and Warragul occurred, and a signal panel was provided. In 1958, the present island platform was provided.

In 1993, siding &quot;A&quot; was abolished, as was a crossover and the up end connection to the former goods yard, with No.2 road baulked at the down end of the Koo Wee Rup Road level crossing. In 1996, No.3 road was abolished, and No.2 road was shortened in length. In 1999, all remaining points were removed.

In 1998, electrified services between Pakenham and Warragul ceased, with de-electrification between those stations occurring in 2001.

On 28 April 2006, the signal panel at the station was abolished.

==Platforms and services==

Nar Nar Goon has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by V/Line Traralgon and selected Bairnsdale line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale

==Transport links==

Warragul Bus Lines operates two routes via Nar Nar Goon station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<doc id="1196560" wikidata="Q5545544" url="?curid=1196560" title="George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates">
<text>Speculation abounded over potential nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States by President George W. Bush since before his presidency.

In the summer of 2005, this speculation became newsworthy due to the announcement of the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor on July 1. President Bush announced federal appellate judge John Roberts as O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s replacement on July 19.

On September 5, two days after the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Bush renominated Roberts as the 17th chief justice of the United States. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, Bush nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to succeed O&#x27;Connor. However, Miers withdrew her nomination on October 27 after facing significant opposition.

On October 31, Bush nominated another federal appellate judge, Samuel Alito, as his new choice to replace O&#x27;Connor. Alito was confirmed as the 110th justice of the Supreme Court on January 31, 2006.

== Overview ==
Throughout much of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States was clearly the least powerful branch of the government, and nominations to that body, although important, were not the source of great political controversy as they are today. Until the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist in 2005, the composition of the Supreme Court had remained unchanged since 1994, the second longest time period without a membership change in U.S. history (the longest having been from 1812 to 1823).

Furthermore, the current court has been sharply divided on a number of high-profile issues, including abortion rights, affirmative action, the extent of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, eminent domain, gay rights, the separation of church and state under the Establishment Clause, sovereign immunity, and states&#x27; rights. The number of close votes in cases involving these areas suggests that a change of one or two key justices could completely shift the thinking of the Court on such issues.

==Politics==
When asked about the kind of justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court, President George W. Bush responded:
&quot;I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. We&#x27;ve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. Legislators make law. Judges interpret the Constitution. ... And that&#x27;s the kind of judge I&#x27;m going to put on there.&quot; In more detail, Bush in 1999 told reporter Fred Barnes of the conservative magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; that he would nominate judges to the court in the mold of originalist Justice Antonin Scalia.

===The filibuster===
Soon after President Bush&#x27;s first inauguration in January 2001, many liberal academics became worried that he would begin packing the federal judiciary with conservative jurists. Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman, writing in the February 2001 edition of &quot;The American Prospect&quot;, encouraged the use of the filibuster to stop Bush from placing any nominee on the Supreme Court during his first term. In addition, law professors Cass Sunstein (University of Chicago) and Laurence Tribe (Harvard), along with Marcia Greenberger of the National Women&#x27;s Law Center, counseled Senate Democrats in April 2001 &quot;to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.&quot; Specifically, they said, &quot;there was no obligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly or erudite.&quot;

On May 9, 2001, President Bush announced his first eleven court of appeals nominees in a special White House ceremony. There was immediate concern expressed by Senate Democrats and liberal groups like the Alliance for Justice. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said that the White House was &quot;trying to create the most ideological bench in the history of the nation.&quot;

From June 2001 to January 2003, when the Senate was controlled by the Democrats, the most conservative appellate nominees were stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee and never given hearings or committee votes. However, after the 2002 mid-term elections in which the Republicans regained control of the Senate by a 51–49 margin, these same nominees began to be moved through the now Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee.

With no other way to block confirmation, the Senate Democrats started to filibuster judicial nominees when they came before the full Senate for final consideration. This forced supporters of the nomination to move to invoke cloture, which, if agreed to by a three-fifths supermajority vote, would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation. On February 12, 2003, Miguel Estrada, a nominee for the D.C. Circuit, became the first court of appeals nominee ever to be filibustered. Later, nine other conservative circuit court nominees were also filibustered. These nine were Priscilla Owen, Charles W. Pickering, Carolyn Kuhl, David McKeague, Henry Saad, Richard Allen Griffin, William H. Pryor Jr., William Myers III and Janice Rogers Brown. Three of the nominees (Estrada, Pickering and Kuhl) withdrew their nominations before the end of the 108th Congress.

===The “nuclear option”===
As a result of these ten filibusters, Senate Republicans began to threaten to change the existing Senate rules by using what Senator Trent Lott termed the &quot;nuclear option&quot;. This change in rules would eliminate the use of the filibuster to prevent judicial confirmation votes. However, with only a two-vote majority, the Republicans were in a weak position to implement this procedural maneuver.

Circumstances changed in 2005, due to the 2004 elections. With President Bush winning re-election and the Republicans increasing their Senate majority to 55—45 for the 109th Congress, the &quot;nuclear option&quot; became a more viable strategy to ensure confirmation. On May 24, 2005, seven moderate senators of each party, called the Gang of 14, in a deal to avoid the use of the &quot;nuclear option&quot;, agreed to drop the filibuster against three of the seven remaining affected court of appeals nominees (Owen, Brown, and Pryor) but not two others (Saad and Myers). In addition, the senators in the group agreed to block future judicial filibusters except in cases involving &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;.

As a direct result of the deal, the two filibustered nominees not mentioned in it (McKeague and Griffin) were confirmed. Despite these agreements, however, some observers noted that the chances were still high that the Democrats would filibuster any of the ten originally filibustered nominees if subsequently nominated to the Supreme Court, especially Owen, Pryor or Brown. There was also speculation that the Democrats would filibuster any Supreme Court nominee who would change the ideological composition of the court.

Historically, although there have been several unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations, only one has been defeated because its opponents were able to successfully maintain a filibuster. This occurred in 1968, when Senate supporters of incumbent Associate Justice Abe Fortas’ nomination to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice lost a vote to invoke cloture by a 45—43 vote, prompting President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw the nomination.

When conservative judge John Roberts was nominated to succeed conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist in September 2005, the confirmation process went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Four months later, the filibuster conjecture was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate Associate Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked (72—25) on his nomination. The next day, January 31, 2006, the Senate confirmed the Alito nomination 58—42.

===Consultations with the U.S. Senate===
As the 2004–2005 term of the Supreme Court ended, there was a flurry of rumors that Rehnquist, who was undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer, would soon retire. On June 27, 2005, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid suggested that the next appointment to the Court should come from outside the judiciary. Reid suggested the appointment of one of four Republican Senators, none of whom possessed previous judicial experience: Mel Martinez, Mike DeWine, Mike Crapo and Lindsey Graham. The list did not include the name of Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a former justice on the Texas Supreme Court. Reid declined to address the omission.

Unexpectedly, on July 1, 2005, it was not Rehnquist who announced his retirement, but O&#x27;Connor. On July 12, Bush met at the White House with the party leaders and ranking Judiciary Committee members from the two major parties – Republicans Bill Frist and Arlen Specter, and Democrats Reid and Patrick Leahy – to discuss the nomination process. During the meeting, the Democrats offered the President the names of three &quot;moderate&quot; Hispanic federal judges that they could accept: Sonia Sotomayor of the Second Circuit, Edward Prado of the Fifth Circuit, and Ricardo Hinojosa, a district court judge from Texas. Reid later told the press he was disappointed that the President had not chosen to discuss his own choice of possible candidates with the Democrats. In the conservative magazine &quot;National Review&quot;, the three candidates suggested by the Democrats were quickly dismissed as being offered in bad faith because they were too liberal for a conservative president to seriously consider. Sotomayor was later nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama (a Democrat) and confirmed as an associate justice in 2009.

On the same day as the president&#x27;s bi-partisan leadership meeting, First Lady Laura Bush stated in a &quot;Today&quot; show interview during an official visit to South Africa a preference for her husband to nominate a woman to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s seat. Bush was surprised at his wife&#x27;s public comments about selecting a replacement for O&#x27;Connor, but said he would be open to hearing her advice when she returned from her trip.

===John Roberts nomination===

On the evening of July 19, 2005, Bush announced his first Supreme Court nominee, choosing John Roberts, a highly regarded former Supreme Court litigator and conservative judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to succeed retiring Associate Justice O&#x27;Connor. During the day leading up to the announcement, there had been much media speculation that one of either two female judges on the Fifth Circuit would be selected: moderate Edith Brown Clement or conservative Edith Jones. Clement was considered the frontrunner. About an hour before the televised announcement, however, information was leaked to the press concerning the choice of Roberts.

On September 3, 2005, Chief Justice Rehnquist died. Three days later, on September 6, Bush officially nominated Roberts to be the next chief justice, and simultaneously withdrew Roberts&#x27;s then-pending nomination to be an associate justice, once again leaving no nominee to replace O‘Connor. Hearings on the Roberts associate justice nomination, set to begin on September 6, were cancelled, and rescheduled hearings, on the chief justice nomination, began on September 12.

===Possible O&#x27;Connor replacements===
On September 6, Specter encouraged the President to fill O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s position with a woman, saying that the Supreme Court should have a minimum of two female justices. On September 9, Laura Bush reiterated her previous wish to also see a female nominee.

On the Thursday before Roberts&#x27; confirmation hearing commenced, one of Reid&#x27;s aides said that the nomination of several candidates said to be on the president&#x27;s short list to replace O&#x27;Connor—conservative appellate Judges J. Michael Luttig, Emilio Garza and Edith Jones—would be unacceptable to the Democrats, implying that any of them would be filibustered. Several days later, Specter made it known that he felt that it was too early for Bush to elevate Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to the Supreme Court.

Roberts&#x27; confirmation hearing for chief justice was held from Monday, September 12, to Friday, September 16. During the week of the hearing, there was much talk that Priscilla Owen would be the next nominee, but columnist Robert Novak reported that by Friday, Reid had told Frist that Judge Owen would also be filibustered if chosen.

On Wednesday, September 21, Bush had another meeting with Senators Frist, Specter, Reid and Leahy to discuss possible Supreme Court nominations. On the day before, Laura Bush mentioned publicly for the third time that she would like to see a female nominee. At the same time, Reid stated that the nomination of any of the previously filibustered appellate nominees would be viewed by the Democrats as &quot;a poke in the eye with a sharp stick&quot;. He restated this position during the meeting with the President when he warned against nominating either Brown or Owen. Again, Reid and Leahy offered the names of appeals court Judges Sotomayor and Prado along with district court Judge Hinojosa. Again, Bush did not offer any names of his own to discuss. On Thursday, September 22, Roberts&#x27; nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 13–5.

During a press conference on Monday, September 26, Bush implied that his next nominee would be either a woman or a minority. In making his decision concerning O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s replacement, he said he would keep in mind that, &quot;diversity is one of the strengths of the country&quot;. John Roberts was confirmed by the United States Senate on Thursday, September 29, by a vote of 78—22 and was sworn in both privately and publicly later the same day.

During the evening of Sunday, October 2, John Fund, a columnist for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, announced on the radio show of blogger Matt Drudge that his sources had told him that the nominee would be moderate Hispanic Judge Consuelo M. Callahan of the Ninth Circuit. The website &quot;ConfirmThem.com&quot;, however, reported on the same evening that the selection had been made in favor of conservative Fourth Circuit Judge Karen J. Williams. On Monday, October 3, President Bush unexpectedly chose little-known White House Counsel Harriet Miers as O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s replacement.

===Harriet Miers nomination===
There was immediate and intense opposition to Miers’ nomination, primarily from conservative Republicans. Principal complaints included:
* That her credentials under objective standards were not sufficient to qualify her for the position.
* That her nomination was the result of political cronyism. Because her legal career did not compare to those of other possible conservative female candidates (like federal appellate judges Edith Jones, Karen J. Williams, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown), many thought that President Bush probably nominated Miers for her personal loyalty to him rather than for her qualifications.
* That there was no written record to demonstrate that she was either a strict constructionist or originalist in her approach to constitutional interpretation. Some conservatives feared that she would support abortion, affirmative action and gay rights if ever confirmed to a seat on the Supreme Court.

On the morning of Thursday, October 27, 2005, President Bush &quot;reluctantly&quot; accepted Miers’ request to withdraw her nomination.

===Samuel Alito nomination===

Bush moved quickly to find an alternative nominee to Miers, a nominee who would have both the credentials that Miers lacked and a conservative judicial philosophy that could be well documented. On the morning of Monday, October 31, Bush announced the nomination of well-known conservative Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., a fifteen-year veteran of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

Alito&#x27;s confirmation hearing was held from Monday, January 9, 2006, to Friday, January 13. On Tuesday, January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10—8 party line vote. Debate on the nomination began in the full Senate on Wednesday, January 25. Despite a last minute effort by Democratic Senator John Kerry to filibuster, which was joined by, among others, Sens. Barack Obama, Joseph Biden, Hillary Clinton, Charles Schumer, and Harry Reid, a cloture vote to end debate passed 72–25 on Monday, January 30. On the morning of Tuesday, January 31, Alito was confirmed to the Supreme Court by a vote of 58–42. Justice Alito was sworn in privately later that same day, and publicly sworn in the following day.

===Epilogue===
At the end of the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook control in the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51–49 majority in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had died or chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, it would have been easy for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow came to that. As it happened, no Supreme Court justice died or retired during the 110th Congress.

<text>Tynong railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Tynong, in Victoria, Australia. Tynong station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 12 February 1880.

== History ==
In 1953, the line from Nar Nar Goon was duplicated, with electrification between Pakenham and Warragul occurring in 1954. In 1956, the line to Bunyip was duplicated, and in 1957, the present island platform was provided, when duplication of the line was provided through the station.

Rail sidings were once provided at Tynong, however they were withdrawn in 1978/1979. On 1 October 1979, freight services to and from the station were withdrawn. A further siding was removed in 1982.

In 1998, electrified services between Pakenham and Warragul ceased, with de-electrification between those stations occurring in 2001.

==Platforms and services==

Tynong has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by V/Line Traralgon and selected Bairnsdale line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale

==Transport links==

* Garfield station – Nar Nar Goon station
* Pakenham station – Garfield station

<text>Orient Beach State Park is a state park located in Southold, New York. The park is situated at the tip of the North Fork of Long Island.

Long Beach, located within the park, was designated a National Natural Landmark in April 1980 for its sand spit beach demonstrating plant succession from salt marsh to maritime red cedar forest.

The Orient Long Beach Bar Light, commonly known as Bug Light, is located inside the park.

==Recreation==

The park offers of bay frontage, and includes a beach, picnic tables with pavilions, a playground, recreation programs, a nature trail, hiking and biking (rentals available), fishing and a food concession. The park is open throughout the year for day-use only.

===Restrictions on boat access===
In 1997, park rangers began enforcing an existing no boating policy on Long Beach, leading to controversy and ticketing in 2000. State officials contended that renewed enforcement was enacted to protect the beach&#x27;s value as a protected sanctuary for endangered birds such as the piping plover, in addition to preserving the beach&#x27;s unusual maritime red cedar forest and other rare plants.

==Flora and fauna==
There is a common and roseate tern nesting area in the park. There are also eelgrass beds offshore.

<text>In Canada, the principal secretary is a senior aide, often the most senior political aide, to a head of government. Formerly, the position of principal secretary was the most senior one in the Canadian Prime Minister&#x27;s office (PMO). However, since 1987, it has been second to the chief of staff position.

The Leader of the Official Opposition and most Premiers also have a principal secretary.

The role of the principal secretary may vary, depending on how the prime minister or premier structures the workflow in their office. This has sometimes led to ambiguity in clearly defining the distinction between the roles of principal secretary and chief of staff to the general public.

==List of principal secretaries to the prime minister==
The organizational structure of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office has traditionally been hierarchical. Depending on the personal approach of the Prime Minister, the duties of managing, administrating and co-ordinating the activities of the PMO may belong to the Principal Secretary, the Chief of Staff, or another key advisor.

The Government of Canada does not maintain an official, complete list of persons that have held leadership positions in the PMO. The following list includes persons that have held the position of Principal Secretary, Private Secretary, Principal Private Secretary, Personal Secretary, or Secretary.

<doc id="1196591" wikidata="Q4781366" url="?curid=1196591" title="Appleseed (EP)">
<text>Appleseed is an EP by American hip hop musician Aesop Rock. It was originally self-released in 1999, and reissued via Rhymesayers Entertainment in 2021. Produced by Aesop Rock himself, Omega One, and Blockhead, it features a guest appearance from Doseone. It peaked at number 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Album Sales chart.

==Release==
The EP was originally self-released on CD-R in 1999. Aesop Rock said: &quot;The first &quot;Appleseed&quot; CD&#x27;s were CD-R&#x27;s I duped at home and sold from my backpack at an MF DOOM show at Brownies, which was right below my apartment at the time.&quot; He added: &quot;I continued to sell hand-to-hand in NY, while Blockhead started fielding some mail orders from a young internet. People would send us cash or a check, and he&#x27;d cut the covers out and mail them off.&quot; In 2021, the official reissue version of the EP was released via Rhymesayers Entertainment.

==Critical reception==

Paul Simpson of AllMusic gave the EP 3.5 stars out of 5, commenting that &quot;&quot;Appleseed&quot;″s lyrics are more introspective than they might seem at first, even if they&#x27;re not quite as autobiographical as later Aesop albums like &quot;Skelethon&quot; and &quot;The Impossible Kid&quot;, and he hadn&#x27;t developed his knack for storytelling yet, so the songs are less narrative and closer to aggravated bursts.&quot; He added: &quot;Musically, the tracks are relatively laid-back and uncomplicated, barely hinting at the grand leap Aesop would take with the more polished production of his 2001 breakthrough &quot;Labor Days&quot;, but they serve as a neat time capsule of the late-&#x27;90s backpacker rap era.&quot; Thomas Quinlan of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; called it &quot;an amazing collection of songs that may end up being the best EP of the year.&quot;

In 2014, Joseph Schafer of &quot;Stereogum&quot; named it the 7th best Aesop Rock record.

In 2021, Eddie Ugarte of &quot;Ghettoblaster Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;The story of &quot;Appleseed&quot; is also the story of a burgeoning independent hip hop scene that began to flourish in the wake of technological innovations of the era, including quality affordable home recording equipment and the rising availability of CD-R drives, which gave artists the freedom to write, record, and manufacture albums outside of the constraints of a label system.&quot;

<doc id="1196601" wikidata="Q137778" url="?curid=1196601" title="Mekosuchinae">
<text>Mekosuchinae is an extinct clade of crocodilians from the Cenozoic of Australasia. They represented the dominant group of crocodilians in the region during most of the Cenozoic, first appearing in the fossil record in the Eocene of Australia, and surviving until the arrival of humans: the Late Pleistocene on the Australian continent and during the Holocene in the Pacific islands of Fiji, New Caledonia and Vanuatu.

Mekosuchine crocodiles are a diverse group displaying a great variety of shapes and sizes. Some taxa, like &quot;Baru&quot; and &quot;Paludirex&quot;, were large semi-aquatic ambush hunters, though the two genera likely differed significantly in their hunting methods. The medium-sized &quot;Australosuchus&quot; may have been relatively cold-resistant and taxa like &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; are renowned for their small size. One of the most distinct mekosuchines was &quot;Quinkana&quot;, with its altirostral (deep) skull and blade-like serrated teeth.

There is some question around the lifestyle of mekosuchines. Based on skull shape, many taxa are semi-aquatic and most mekosuchines have relatively conservative hip morphology, although other factors might indicate greater terrestrial capabilities. The humeri are straighter than in modern crocodiles, allowing them to perform the so-called &quot;highwalk&quot; more easily. &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; and &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; are commonly regarded as more terrestrial, perhaps similar to dwarf caimans and dwarf crocodiles, while &quot;Quinkana&quot; displays a skull shape very similar to terrestrial crocodylomorphs like sebecids and planocraniids. In the case of &quot;Quinkana&quot;, this interpretation is mostly hindered by the near complete lack of l material, with the exception of some isolated hip bones which suggest the presence of a mekosuchine with erect limbs in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, where &quot;Quinkana&quot; was found.

Mekosuchines were historically considered to be true crocodiles (of the family Crocodylidae), but modern research favors the idea that they either diverged before the split between gharials and crocodiles or that they are a sister group to Crocodylidae. Some recent studies have even played with the idea that Orientalosuchina, a clade of small crocodilians from the Cretaceous to Paleogene of Asia, might be a part of Mekosuchinae. Regardless of their origins, mekosuchines rapidly diversified between their first appearance during the Eocene and the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, when as many as five different genera of very different morphology all inhabited the freshwater environments and forests of the Riversleigh.

Mekosuchines underwent a decline in post-Miocene Australia, with most genera believed to have gone extinct due to an especially severe period of aridification. While mekosuchines recovered during the Pliocene, the continuous decline of inland freshwater systems and the associated terrestrial biomes gradually lead to the decline of the family. By the Pleistocene only the genera &quot;Quinkana&quot; and &quot;Paludirex&quot; still inhabited mainland Australia, alongside the more recent true crocodiles. After the demise of the last mainland mekosuchines, the group survived on Vanuatu and New Caledonia until the Holocene. In both instances the extinction of mekosuchines happens around roughly the same time as the arrival of humans, though it is unclear how much of a part, if any, they played in these events. For the mainland taxa it is argued that their disappearance was entirely related to climate change, with the pattern of extinction matching the disappearance of river basins but not the appearance of humans. Things are more complex for the island forms, with some researchers questioning how much &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; and humans truly overlapped. If humans played a role in the extinction of the last mekosuchines, it could have been either directly due to overhunting or more indirectly through habitat destruction and invasive species like rats.

==History of discovery==
===Early finds===
Although the family Mekosuchinae was not established until the 1990s, fossil material belonging to members of this clade had been known from the Australian continent for a long time. The first material now recognised as belonging to this group of crocodilians was described in 1886 by English zoologist Charles Walter De Vis. The fossils, discovered in the Darling Downs in Queensland, consisted of skull and postcranial fragments that De Vis dubbed &quot;Pallimnarchus pollens&quot;. De Vis himself only coined the name &quot;out of convenience&quot;, admitting that he was too unfamiliar with the Cenozoic crocodilian fossil record to be certain that his find represented an animal distinct from any other taxa known at the time. Later research has even shown that the material belonged not only to multiple individuals but multiple different genera, with various bones since then having been referred to &quot;Paludirex&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot; respectively. Regardless of De Vis&#x27; caution regarding the taxon, the name &quot;Pallimnarchus&quot; eventually came to be widely used by other authors.

===Renaissance===
Despite these early finds, research on genera that we now classify as mekosuchines would grow quiet during the first half of the 20th century, with the lack of published research focused on Australasian crocodilians during the middle of the century leading to a 40-year hiatus. This period would come to an end in 1977 with the publications of Max Hecht, Michael Archer and Ralph Molnar, all of which reported on fossil material collected from cave deposits in northern Queensland. This material encompassed both more fragmentary remains as well as better preserved ones, including a nearly complete rostrum recovered from the Tea Tree Cave. The material was quickly noted for its distinct morphology, bearing some resemblance to terrestrial crocodylomorphs like sebecosuchians and planocraniids. Following the discovery of even more fossil fragments, the taxon was named &quot;Quinkana&quot; in 1981, though early interpretations linked it to the Paleogene planocraniids rather than the already established &quot;Pallimnarchus&quot;.

In 1982, just a year later, Molnar published a paper focused on &quot;Pallimnarchus&quot;, attempting to revise the genus by establishing a lectotype specimen to compensate for the fact that De Vis did not establish a holotype. Around the same time, reports of crocodilian fossil material came out of New Caledonia, these leading to the description of &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; by French paleontologists Jean-Christophe Balouet and Eric Buffetaut in 1987. Like with &quot;Quinkana&quot;, the distinct morphology of &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; initially obscured its relationship to modern crocodilians, with the team placing it in the newly named family Mekosuchidae, which they placed as an early branch of Eusuchia and the sister group to the three extant groups of crocodilians (crocodiles, gharials, alligators and caiman).

===Recent work===

The 1970s and 1980s set the groundwork for what would be a period of increased interest in Australasian crocodilians during the 1990s and early 2000s. In addition to Hecht, Archer and Molnar, a variety of other authors would publish on crocodile fossil material during this time, many of which going on to become quite prolific in the study of mekosuchines. These include Paul Willis, Steven Salisbury and Dirk Megirian. Following the description of &quot;Baru&quot;, scientists began to recognize shared traits among the fossil crocodiles of Australia, with Willis and colleagues proposing the presence of what they dubbed the Australian Tertiary crocodylian radiation. This concept initially included the three mainland taxa &quot;Baru&quot;, &quot;Quinkana&quot; and &quot;Pallimnarchus&quot; and was later expanded to include &quot;Australosuchus&quot; as well, named a year later in 1991.

The concept of the Australian Tertiary crocodylian radiation would come to be replaced by the subfamily Mekosuchinae in 1993, defined by Willis, Molnar and John Scanlon as a subfamily of the Crocodylidae. The name was intentionally carried over from the monotypic Mekosuchidae of Balouet and Buffetaut, with Willis and colleagues meaning to preserve the seniority of the name while adapting it to more accurately reflect their supposed position among crocodilians at the time. In terms of composition, the only new taxa included were &quot;Kambara&quot;, named in the same paper, and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;, the namesake of the clade. Other mekosuchines recognized during the 1990s were &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, named not long after the family was described in 1993, as well as three additional species of &quot;Quinkana&quot;, two species of &quot;Baru,&quot; and one species each of &quot;Kambara&quot;, &quot;Pallimnarchus,&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;.

This trajectory more or less carried over into the 2000s and 2010s, seeing the description of two more &quot;Kambara&quot; species, two more &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; species were described, alongside entirely new genera such as &quot;Volia&quot;, &quot;Kalthifrons,&quot; and &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;. Another spike in research occurred during the late 2010s and early 2020s with the publication of multiple papers helmed by Jorgo Ristevski, whose work includes a complete overhaul of the genus &quot;Pallimnarchus&quot;, coining the new name &quot;Paludirex&quot; in its place to bring stability to the taxon, two studies on the cranium of &quot;Trilophosuchus,&quot; and a summary of Australasian crocodylian research co-authored with several other researchers previously involved in mekosuchine research. 2023 saw the description of &quot;Baru iylwenpeny&quot;, previously only known as the &quot;Alcoota &quot;Baru&quot;&quot;, while the year 2024 saw a reinterpretation of &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, concluding that it was synonymous with &quot;&quot;Baru&quot; huberi&quot;.

== Species ==
Though sometimes included within Mekosuchinae, the Miocene taxon &quot;Harpacochampsa&quot; is regarded as a type of gavialoid in recent research.

===Unnamed forms===

In addition to the many named genera and species, scientists also recognize a plethora of distinct taxa that have not been scientifically described or named yet. Among these is the so-called &quot;Darling Downs taxon&quot;, which is represented by multiple bone fragments that bear some resemblance to species of the genus &quot;Paludirex&quot; while also being visibly distinct from both named species. While too fragmentary to conclusively assign to the genus or erect as a new species, the material has been tentatively regarded as a third species of &quot;Paludirex&quot;, with the possibility that it might be a different genus altogether. Another example would be the &quot;Bullock Creek taxon&quot;, a small mekosuchine long known to share affinities with &quot;Ultrastenos&quot; and which likely belongs to the genus, but as of yet unnamed.

Unnamed species are also known for the genus &quot;Quinkana&quot;, notably in the form of the Ongeva &quot;Quinkana&quot; from Alcoota. The &quot;Floraville taxon&quot;, meanwhile, may represent a separate genus of ziphodont mekosuchine rather than another &quot;Quinkana&quot; species. Ziphodont crocodilian teeth have also been recovered from Australia&#x27;s Mount Etna Caves National Park.

Remains of a ziphodont crocodilian have been known from the Pliocene Otibanda Formation of Papua New Guinea since 1967, but were initially referred to Sebecosuchia before the discovery of ziphodont mekosuchines. Given that they were not figured nor described in detail, the affinities of these teeth remained largely mysterious in the following 50 years. This changed in late 2024, when the teeth were described in greater detail by Ristevski, Molnar and Yates. The study identifies the remains as ?Mekosuchinae gen. et sp. indet., reasoning that the geography and age would be very unusual for any of the other Cenozoic ziphodont crocodylomorph, yet its morphologically not possible to distinguish it from sebecosuchians or planocraniids. Similarly, it&#x27;s not possible to distinguish it from species of the genus &quot;Quinkana&quot; until a better understanding of the variation between ziphodont crocodilian teeth is achieved.

Another geographically significant putative mekosuchine is the &quot;Bannockburn Formation taxon&quot;, a crocodilian that lived in New Zealand during the Early Miocene. While the material is too fragmentary to be tested for mekosuchine affinities, field work near St. Bathans has recovered more material that could help resolve the matter. Additionally, these finds also seem to suggest that at least two different crocodilians inhabited New Zealand during this time period.

Much like the &quot;Bannockburn Formation taxon&quot;, the &quot;Runcorn taxon&quot; (named after a suburb of Brisbane) is too fragmentary to be conclusively assigned to Mekosuchinae, but is often speculated to have been a part of the group regardless, with Paul Willis even suggesting it may have been a species of &quot;Kambara&quot;.

==Description==
===Skull shape===
One of the most noticeable traits of mekosuchines is the wide range of skull shapes found across the family. At their simplest mekosuchines greatly resemble modern crocodiles, with taxa such as &quot;Kambara&quot;, &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, and &quot;Australosuchus&quot; having triangular platyrostral skulls, meaning that they are flattened, with both the nostrils and eyes mostly facing upwards. The specifics of this morphotype differ among taxa, as seen between the contemporary &quot;Kambara implexidens&quot; with its relatively narrow snout and the much more wide-snouted &quot;K. murgonensis&quot;. As with many modern crocodilians, the skulls feature various degrees of festooning, which describes the patterns of constriction that give the rostrum a somewhat outline. Especially prominent is a notch formed just behind the premaxillae that received the fourth tooth of the lower jaw when the jaws were closed. In this regard, &quot;Australosuchus&quot; stands out in having this fourth dentary tooth almost entirely enclosed, with the notch being more accurately described as a semi-enclosed pit. Another deviation from the platyrostral morphotype is seen in &quot;Paludirex&quot;, which, although still platyrostral, has a much deeper and more robust skull shape with a rostrum that is proportionally much wider than that of other platyrostral mekosuchines.

Members of the genus &quot;Baru&quot; combine the wedge-shaped triangular skull and strong festooning seen in many generalist forms with a more altirostral skull morphology, making their heads much deeper than those of other mekosuchines. The festooning is especially strong in &quot;Baru&quot; and the teeth are described as enlarged and laterally compressed. The teeth of two of the species, &quot;B. darrowi&quot; and &quot;B. iylwenpeny&quot;, bear fine serrations along the cutting edges of the teeth. This led some early publications to refer to them as , although later papers prefer the term &quot;&quot; to distinguish them from truly ziphodont teeth.

True ziphodonty, as well as an even more developed altirostral skull, are hallmarks of the genus &quot;Quinkana&quot;. Like in &quot;Baru&quot;, the skull of &quot;Quinkana&quot; is distinctly trapezoid in cross-section and noticeably deeper than those of more generalized mekosuchines and modern crocodiles. The skull of &quot;Quinkana&quot; is generally compared to those of sebecosuchians and planocraniids, with that of &quot;Q. fortirostrum&quot; distinctly broader and resembling the former and that of &quot;Q. timara&quot; being closer to the latter. Festooning is almost nonexistent in &quot;Q. fortirostrum&quot;, with the lower margin of the rostrum almost straight, save for a notch behind the premaxilla. The teeth are blade-like, laterally compressed and ziphodont in most species, the being adorned by a series of prominent serrations. Unlike the crenulations seen in &quot;Baru&quot;, the denticles that form the serrations on &quot;Quinkana&quot; teeth are separated by distinct . The number of denticles differs, with &quot;Q. timara&quot; having finer serrations due to having more denticles relative to &quot;Q. fortirostrum&quot;, while &quot;Q. meboldi&quot; lacks them altogether.

The fourth major skull morphotype seen in mekosuchines is displayed by the dwarf taxa &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; and also falls into the category of altirostry, while at the same time being shortened (brachycephalic). These taxa had boxy skulls with large eyes that bear some resemblance to dwarf caimans and dwarf crocodiles, as well as extinct animals like &quot;Theriosuchus&quot;, &quot;Protosuchus&quot; and various notosuchians. No teeth are known from &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, while the teeth of &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; seem to have had different morphologies depending on the species. The continental &quot;M. whitehunterensis&quot; and &quot;M. sanderi&quot; display blade-like teeth, while at least the posterior teeth of the island species &quot;M. inexpectatus&quot; were blunt and rounded.

===Size===
Mekosuchines come in a wide range of sizes, with the smallest known genus &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; measuring an estimated long. &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; is one of several small-bodied taxa placed in a clade of dwarf and insular mekosuchines, with other notable dwarf taxa including &quot;Mekosuchus whitehunterensis&quot;, estimated to reach lengths around , &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, which possibly reached a length of around , and &quot;M. inexpectatus&quot;, which has been estimated to have grown to lengths of around by Holt and up to by Balouet.

Species of &quot;Quinkana&quot; have been estimated between for &quot;Q. meboldi&quot; and for &quot;Q. fortirostrum&quot;, pushing it into the range of the medium-sized members of the family. Some larger reports exist, but these concern remains that are poorly understood and fragmentary. Other mekosuchines in this range include &quot;Kalthifrons&quot;, &quot;Australosuchus&quot; and &quot;Kambara&quot;, with the latter reaching between depending on the species.

The largest well understood mekosuchines belong to the genera &quot;Baru&quot; and &quot;Paludirex&quot;, reaching lengths of and respectively.

==Phylogeny==
===Internal relationships===
Mekosuchinae is cladistically defined as a node-based taxon composed of the last common ancestor of &quot;Kambara implexidens&quot;, &quot;Mekosuchus inexpectatus&quot;, and all of its descendants. Beyond this definition, which necessitates the inclusion of &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; in the clade, various different interpretations of the members of the group and their internal relationships exist. These interpretations differ in a multitude of ways, but also share certain topologies. For instance, taxa such as &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Australosuchus&quot; are typically regarded as being basal offshoots of the family, sometimes joined by the much younger genus &quot;Kalthifrons&quot;. Ristevski and colleagues recovered &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; as the first mekosuchine to split from the clade, followed by &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Australosuchus&quot;, in 2023. This is contrasted by a 2023 publication by Yates, Ristevski &amp; Salisbury, who found &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Australosuchus&quot; to form their own small clade at the base of the group with &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; diverging at a slightly later time. Meanwhile, a publication by Lee &amp; Yates in 2018 recovered &quot;Australosuchus&quot; as the basalmost mekosuchine, followed by &quot;Kambara&quot; and finding &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; in a much more derived position among the members of mekosuchinae.

Modern phylogenies commonly see more derived members of the family split among two branches that diverge from another after taxa like &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Australosuchus&quot; do. Ristevski &quot;et al.&quot;, 2023, sees the family split into two clades: one containing the large bodied forms &quot;Baru&quot;, &quot;Paludirex&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot;; and one clade of insular and dwarf taxa, which features &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, &quot;Volia&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;. Lee and Yates also recovered this split in 2018, although the makeup of the clades differs slightly. In their study, &quot;Baru&quot; still clades with &quot;Paludirex&quot; (here still &quot;Pallimnarchus&quot;), but in place of &quot;Quinkana&quot; the clade instead includes &quot;Kalthifrons&quot;. The other clade is likewise similar to what has been recovered by later studies, featuring &quot;Ultrastenos&quot; (then known as &quot;&quot;Baru&quot; huberi&quot; and clading with the undescribed Bullock Creek taxon), &quot;Volia&quot;, &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot;. Yates, Ristevski and Salisbury did not recover this distinct branching of clades in their 2023 study, however, their phylogeny also did not include several taxa present in the other studies.

The phylogenies mentioned above can be seen here:
Lee &amp; Yates, 2018
Yates, Ristevski &amp; Salisbury, 2023
Ristevski &quot;et al.&quot; (modified by Yates &amp; Stein, 2024)

A stark contrast to these comparably similar phylogenies can be found in a 2021 study by Jonathan Rio &amp; Philip D. Mannion. The most notable differences from the above phylogenies are the placements of &quot;Australosuchus&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot;, neither of which were recovered as mekosuchines in this study. &quot;Australosuchus&quot; was placed just outside of Crocodylidae and &quot;Quinkana&quot; was recovered as a proper crocodyline, sister to &quot;&quot;Crocodylus&quot; megarhinus&quot;. In exchange, the Chinese taxon &quot;&quot;Asiatosuchus&quot; nanlingensis&quot; was placed within an offshoot of mekosuchinae alongside a paraphyletic &quot;Kambara&quot;. Other elements are however more similar to the studies of Yates, Ristevski and colleagues. &quot;Kambara&quot; remains a basal mekosuchine and a distinct dwarf clade can be observed, formed in this case by &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; and &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;. Notably, this study predates the 2024 reinterpretation of &quot;Ultrastenos&quot; and thus also includes &quot;&quot;Baru&quot; huberi&quot; as a separate taxon, although both fall within the dwarf clade.

===Orientalosuchina===

In addition to the more standard topology recovered by Ristevski and colleagues, they also produced two phylogenetic trees that represent the two most novel interpretations of the group. These trees prominently feature the clade Orientalosuchina, crocodilians that lived during the Cretaceous and Palgeogene in Asia, as being deeply nested within Mekosuchinae. In both trees Mekosuchinae is divided into two clades, a feature they share with other analyses. The more traditional of these clades includes various medium- to large-sized taxa from continental Australia, namely &quot;Kalthifrons&quot;, &quot;Quinkana&quot;, &quot;Baru&quot; and &quot;Paludirex&quot;, not dissimilar to the other trees recovered by Ristevski &quot;et al.&quot;. Meanwhile, the other clade includes Orientalosuchina and small-bodied as well as insular taxa, in other words: &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, &quot;Volia&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;.

Within this topology, orientalosuchins are mostly grouped together to form their own monophyletic clade that acts as the sister-group to the small-bodied mekosuchines. This clade includes the genera &quot;Krabisuchus&quot;, &quot;Orientalosuchus&quot;, &quot;Jiangxisuchus&quot; and &quot;Eoalligator&quot;, but not &quot;Dongnanosuchus&quot;, which is closer to the traditional mekosuchine taxa. &quot;Protoalligator&quot; also wasn&#x27;t part of the clade, but unlike &quot;Dongnanosuchus&quot; this is related to the animal being recovered as a basal eusuchian instead of a mekosuchine. Another notable divergence from the traditional interpretation of Mekosuchinae concerns &quot;Australosuchus&quot; and &quot;Kambara&quot;, which are both recovered as non-mekosuchines. In addition to changing the internal composition of the clade, the phylogenetic trees recovering Orientalosuchina within Mekosuchinae also shuffle how the group relates to other crocodilians. While mekosuchines as a whole are more distantly related to true crocodiles in these trees, &quot;Australosuchus&quot; and &quot;Kambara&quot; remain closely allied to Crocodyloidea. Specifically, &quot;Australosuchus&quot; is recovered as the basalmost crocodyloid in both analyses, while &quot;Kambara&quot; was recovered as the direct sister taxon to Crocodylidae.

However, there is little evidence that actually supports this grouping. Five possible synapomorphies were identified in the trees that feature Orientalosuchina as members of Mekosuchinae, although none of them are exclusive to these groups nor identified in all included members. Various other morphological features are shared between certain mekosuchines and orientalosuchins as well, but these are also either inconsistently present or widespread amongst crocodilians, especially among alligatoroids. Additionally, the remainder of the eight analyses all recovered a more traditional Mekosuchinae, while members of Orientalosuchina claded with alligatoroids. Ristevski and colleagues conclude that the evidence to support this hypothesis is weak, both phylogenetically and morphologically, but should nonetheless be explored in greater detail.

===External relationships===

The relationships between mekosuchines and other groups of crocodilians is another matter that has seen repeated shifts across time. When Mekosuchidae was established in 1987 for &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;, the then monotypic family was placed within Eusuchia. However, around that time crocodile phylogenetics were still poorly studied and Eusuchia was considered a subgroup of Crocodylia, unlike today. By 1993, when Mekosuchinae was coined to include all other Australian Cenozoic crocodilians known at the time, the clade was placed in the family Crocodylidae and regarded as a mere subfamily, a view that remained prominent in literature in subsequent years.

Today however this view is no longer supported, with modern phylogenetic analysis generally agreeing that the clade does not represent a subfamily of crocodylids, but rather a more basal clade. While it is not exactly agreed upon where the group splits off, two main hypotheses exist. In their 2018 study, which incorporates morphological, molecular (DNA sequencing), and stratigraphic (fossil age) data, Lee and Yates recover mekosuchines as the sister group to Longirostres, which is formed by modern gharials (and false gharials) together with true crocodiles. Similar results were yielded by two phylogenetic trees recovered by Ristevski and colleagues in 2023, with the better resolved of the two suggesting that mekosuchines (including Orientalosuchina) split from other crocodilians at some point after planocraniids but before the split between crocodyloids and gavialoids.

The more widely accepted hypothesis is the notion that mekosuchines, while not members of the Crocodylidae itself, are still crocodyloids. Following this hypothesis, which was also recovered by Ristevski &quot;et al.&quot; in 2023, they are nested deep within Longirostres as the immediate sister group to crocodylids, with the African &quot;&quot;Crocodylus&quot; megarhinus&quot; as the sister taxon to the clade formed by crocodylids and mekosuchines. The same topology was previously reported by Rio &amp; Mannion in 2021, and was later repeated in a 2023 publication by Yates, Ristevski and Salisbury.

==Evolutionary history==
===Origins===

The shifting phylogenetic position of mekosuchines as well as the poor record of crocodylomorph fossils from Australia have long obscured the origins of the clade. The Mesozoic crocodylomorph record from the continent is solely represented by &quot;Confractosuchus&quot; and &quot;Isisfordia&quot; which, depending on the publication, may either be highly derived non-eusuchian members of Neosuchia or among the basalmost eusuchians. Regardless, this renders them notably more basal than the later mekosuchines, which are confidently placed among crown crocodilians. Following the most common trees in which orientalosuchins are not mekosuchines, the clade at the latest originated during the late Danian, approximately 66 million years ago and around 10 million years before their first confirmed appearance in the fossil record through &quot;Kambara&quot;. However, if Orientalosuchina is indeed a subclade of mekosuchines, this would push the origins of the clade back into the Cretaceous.
The second hypothesis in particular would place the origin of the group in Asia, with the earliest mekosuchines then arriving in Australia before the Eocene. However, Ristevski and colleagues note that the gap between the two continents was substantially greater than it is today, meaning that such a journey would have required the crocodiles to traverse large stretches of ocean, or at the very least do a significant amount of island hopping (though the presence of islands in this time period is not certain). This manner of travel would in turn profit from at least some form of osmoregulation being present in early mekosuchines, which is known to be present in gharials and true crocodiles. However, the presence of salt glands as seen in these clades cannot be determined from fossils and with the exception of the insular taxa of the Quaternary all mekosuchines are exclusively known from inland environments. Still, Ristevski and colleagues note that certain extant alligatoroids venture into marine environments, to a lesser extent than true crocodiles, although they lack salt glands. Given that these hypothetical ancestral mekosuchines were likely to have been generalized animals similar to &quot;Kambara&quot;, it is very possible that they traversed long distances by swimming, possibly with at least some degree of salt tolerance.

There are still other possibilities for the origin of Mekosuchinae in Australia. For instance, mekosuchines could have hypothetically arrived via land if dispersing from Asia into Europe and then the Americas or directly from Asia into North America. From there, they could have moved to South America, dispersed into Antarctica and entered Australia from the south. However, a key issue with this idea is the complete lack of mekosuchine fossil material from the Americas and Antarctica, rendering dispersal from Asia directly into Australia (or via India) the more likely of the two origins.

===Diversification and faunal shift===

While the range and diversity of mekosuchines was still relatively restricted during the Eocene, by the Late Oligocene the group had rapidly diversified into a plethora of different morphotypes ranging from semi-aquatic generalists to large prey specialists, dwarf forms and potentially terrestrial predators. The origin of this diversification is unclear due to the absence of mekosuchine fossils in the 30 million year gap between the Late Oligocene forms and the earlier &quot;Kambara.&quot; However, it is thought that the ancestor of this radiation appeared no later than the middle Eocene. Despite their enormous taxonomic diversity, the range of mekosuchines during this time period was still somewhat limited, with Miocene records primarily stemming from localities in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

Initially, the transition from the Miocene to the Pliocene was regarded as somewhat of a drop in diversity among mekosuchines as it saw the disappearance of both the large macropredatory &quot;Baru&quot; as well as dwarf forms like &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;. The reasons for this wave of extinction may be tied to widespread changes in climate, with both global cooling and the Middle Miocene climate optimum coming to an end. This may have led to an especially harsh but brief period of aridity that saw a retreat of the Australian rainforests and the destruction of the biomes preferred by Miocene mekosuchine groups. &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; specifically represents somewhat of an outlier, as it only went extinct on the mainland and continued to survive into the Holocene on various Pacific islands. Subsequently, Ristevski and colleagues point out that future finds might show that these animals could have survived for a little longer on the mainland as well.

While the Miocene-Pliocene transition saw the disappearance of many of the established mekosuchine groups, it did not cause the extinction of the family. &quot;Quinkana&quot; survived the initial period of aridification as did other mekosuchines, which in turn gave rise to forms like &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; and &quot;Paludirex&quot;. Despite the fact that mekosuchines bounced back, they were joined by other groups of crocodilians that made their way to Australia, such as the as of yet unnamed Tirari Desert species of &quot;Crocodylus&quot;. While it was initially hypothesized that the appearance of &quot;Crocodylus&quot; in Australia was part of the reason mekosuchines went extinct, there is no actual evidence to suggest a direct link between the two events, with the Tirari Desert taxon likely being entirely unrelated to the crocodiles inhabiting Australia today.

===Island populations===

Almost as mysterious as the origins of the group is the presence of mekosuchines on distant Pacific islands during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Although multiple examples are known; &quot;Volia&quot; from Fiji, &quot;Mekosuchus kalpokasi&quot; from Vanuatu, and &quot;Mekosuchus inexpectatus&quot; from New Caledonia; there is no agreement on how these animals got there from mainland Australia. Just like in discussions about the original colonisation of Australia by the clade, the question of osmoregulation and salt tolerance comes into play when speculating on how these distant islands were colonised. Salisbury and colleagues have previously suggested that &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; might have been more salt tolerant due to the lack of permanent freshwater sources on New Caledonia, however, assuming that the genus was more terrestrial as frequently speculated, the absence of fresh water might have been less crucial.

An alternative hypothesis suggests that mekosuchines arrived on Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia through the act of rafting (being carried there by clinging to drift wood and similar structures) or island hopping. The latter would have especially profited from lower sea levels during this time period, connecting island chains and providing potential stops along the way. While this dispersal could have happened as early as the Oligocene, it is likely that island mekosuchines were a much more recent development.

===Extinction===

Despite the fact that mekosuchines initially recovered from the aridification that caused the Miocene-Pliocene faunal turnover, the group continued to suffer from the effects of global cooling and Australia&#x27;s continuous drift north throughout the Pleistocene. This gradual change in climate was felt across most groups of megafauna that inhabited Australia at the time, with the semiaquatic mekosuchines like &quot;Paludirex&quot; suffering the most from the disappearance of inland river systems. Hocknull and colleagues write that the Lake Eyre Basin was among the first systems to rapidly deteriorate some 48.000 years ago, followed shortly by other systems in the next eight thousand years. Rainfall fell to levels far below those of today, deriving the systems of their water supply. This did not change until 30.000 years ago, when it was too late for the systems to recover. While it has been speculated that members of the genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot; could have retreated to coastal waters, surviving due to their osmoregulation, while the more freshwater dependant mekosuchines like &quot;Paludirex&quot; would have died out as their habitats dried up.

This drying may have also affected more terrestrial forms like &quot;Quinkana&quot;. Despite its inferred lifestyle, members of the genus are still commonly found in close proximity to freshwater and likely inhabited more forested environments. The aridification of Australia led to the collapse of the continents rainforest systems approximately 50.000 years ago and by 44.000 years ago fires had begun to crop up more frequently than before. Even before these events, authors note a shift from vine scrubland to more open environments during the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene, coinciding with a decrease in known &quot;Quinkana&quot; material.

In both the instances listed above, human involvement appears to not have been a factor, with Hocknull and colleagues arguing that the two events simply coincided, citing the fact that the megafaunal extinctions on the Australian mainland seemingly ran in the opposite direction of what would be suspected if humans were the driving cause.
While mainland mekosuchines died out during the Pleistocene, isolated insular taxa continued to survive, possibly even into the Holocene. The extinction of &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; is frequently linked to the arrival of the Lapita people in the South Pacific, supported by the fact that the range of the genus overlapped with human settlements and by the association of &quot;M. kalpokasi&quot; remains with human tools at the Arapus archaeological site on Efate. Factors contributing to the disappearance of island mekosuchines range from direct hunting of the crocodiles to habitat destruction and the introduction of invasive species like pigs and rats. However, this idea is not entirely uncontested, as Anderson and colleagues point out that most remains of &quot;M. inexpectatus&quot; appear to have been deposited prior to human arrival. They further highlight that no direct evidence for crocodile-human interactions (like butchery marks) exist. The last mekosuchines likely died out approximately 3.000 years ago, with some disputed material suggesting that &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; might have even lived until as recently as 1,720 years ago.

==Paleobiology==
===Terrestriality===
Although most mekosuchines exhibit hallmark traits of being semi-aquatic animals, possessing flattened skulls with nares and eyes directed more upward, there are some genera which might suggest that a more land-based lifestyle arose in some branches of the family.
The earliest hints at these derived terrestrial mekosuchines can actually be found in the oldest known member of the family: &quot;Kambara&quot;. Despite being widely recognized as semi-aquatic with a classically crocodilian head suited for such life, &quot;Kambara&quot; also featured certain peculiar adaptations to its limbs that could have facilitated much easier travel across land relative to modern crocodiles. Study of the humerus has shown that the upper forelimbs could have been swung with much greater force and would have provided greater stability when walking, helping the animal keep its torso off the ground while performing the so-called high walk. At the same time, these adaptations would have positively affected both stride length and walking speed as well. The range of motion of the forelimbs was likewise greater than what is seen in the true crocodiles that inhabit Australia today.

A later study focused on mekosuchines in general; examining material assigned to &quot;Kambara&quot;, &quot;Baru&quot;, the &quot;Floraville Taxon&quot; and what might have either been a juvenile &quot;Baru&quot; or &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;; suggests that the group as a whole had collumnar humeri than modern crocodylids with an elliptical rather than rounded cross-section. These factors significantly affect the stress the bones are put under when the animals lift their bodies of the ground, either for a sprawling gait or for the highwalk. The study suggests that the curved humeri of modern crocs serve to provide a more constant core of neutral stress regardless of what gait is assumed by them and provide greater safety when sprawling. Mekosuchines meanwhile appear to have had a lower baseline stress that does not spike as much when switching from one gait to the other, effectively making the highwalk much more viable. The anatomy also seems to support the idea that mekosuchines would have been able to perform the highwalk even after reaching a certain size, while many modern crocodiles cease to move this way after growing too large.

All these adaptations, while advantageous for walking on land, do not necessarily show that mekosuchines as a whole were terrestrial, rather they show that they were better adapted to walk on land while not negating any of the adaptations for aquatic life. This is somewhat highlighted by the anatomy of the shoulder girdle and hips, which although favouring terrestrial habits in one instance, generally appear very close to those of modern crocodilians. In the case of &quot;Kambara&quot; specifically, the hips represent the plesiomorphic condition and greatly resemble those of gharials and alligators, with later mekosuchines seemingly either diverging into more terrestrial forms or converging with modern crocodiles. Regarding the limbs of &quot;Kambara&quot;, the same adaptations useful for movement on land also bring advantages for swimming. Lucas A. Buchanan, who described &quot;Kambara taraina&quot;, notes in his PhD thesis that the animal does not show any other notable adaptations for terrestrial life and sticks close to the anatomy of modern salt- and freshwater crocodiles in many aspects. The notion that &quot;Kambara&quot; could have possessed a fibular condyle and thus had more hinge-like movement of the knee is entertained, but could not be confirmed due to the preservation of the fossil material. A final clue against overly terrestrial habits in &quot;Kambara&quot; is the fact that most individuals are known from a mass death site that preserves the results of a lake drying out, killing the crocodilians that previously inhabited it.

More commonly regarded as terrestrial, albeit not uncontested, are species of the genera &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot;, each of them supported by multiple lines of reasoning. One key aspect in favour of terrestrial habits is the skull shape. Unlike most other mekosuchines including &quot;Kambara&quot;, all three of these taxa had altirostral skulls, meaning the head was comparably boxy and deep rather than flattened.
In Mekosuchus the eyes are large and directed towards the side of the skull while the nostrils open more towards the front, whereas both open more towards the top of the skull in semi-aquatic crocodiles, allowing them to see above the water&#x27;s surface even if otherwise submerged. Habitat has also been a factor, with the island of New Caledonia, where &quot;M. inexpectatus&quot; lived, lacking in large bodies of freshwater, while Balouet and Buffetaut further point to the well developed muscular insertions. &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; has a similar skull to &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;, though the position of the nares is unknown. Study of muscle attachment sites have suggested that &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; held its head much higher than typical for crocodilians, more akin to what is seen in agamid lizards or basking caimans today. Historically, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; has been compared to both protosuchids and notosuchians, two famously terrestrial groups of Mesozoic crocodylomorphs. Scans of the brain also seem to give clues towards terrestrial life, with brain pneumaticity in particular seemingly correlating with the animals lifestyle. According to Ristevski and colleagues, &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; displays a blend of features of crocodylians and more basal groups. The overall shape of the endocast resembles &quot;Araripesuchus&quot; and the ratios between the inner ear elements bears resemblance to baurusuchids and sphenosuchians. The highly pneumatized skull is compared favorably to notosuchians and, notably, modern dwarf caimans and dwarf crocodiles of the general &quot;Paleosuchus&quot; and &quot;Osteolaemus&quot;. This comparison was not novel and had previously been proposed by Holt in 2007, who suggested that &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; may have inhabited small rainforest streams and came out during the night to hunt near the waters edge or on land.

More unconventional is the hypothesis that &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; specifically was an arboreal animal, however this idea, first introduced by Willis in 1997, was later argued against by Scanlon and is entirely absent in recent literature including the 2023 work by Jorgo Ristevski (which Willis participated in).
Much like with &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;, the idea that &quot;Quinkana&quot; was terrestrial is primarily based on the outward appearance of the skull, which is deep and houses rows of ziphodont teeth (meaning they were blade-lake compressed with prominent serrations along the cutting edge). This anatomy drew immediate comparison to sebecids and planocraniids, two much better understood groups of Cretaceous to Paleogene crocodylomorphs famous for their terrestrial lifestyles. Though the precise use of ziphodont teeth is unclear, several authors have come forward to propose that they may be linked to taking terrestrial prey, chasing prey on land or more broadly that &quot;Quinkana&quot; filled a nische similar to modern Komodo dragons. A key issue with the inferred terrestrial habits of &quot;Quinkana&quot; is the lack of postcranial material that would be crucial in confirming or debunking these ideas. In the case of planocraniids, the presence of a rounded tail cross-section (rather than laterally flattened) and hoof-like toes both clearly point to terrestrial habits, but no such material is confidently assigned to &quot;Quinkana&quot;. The closest to &quot;Quinkana&quot; postcrania to be found consists of some pelvic remains described as &quot;pelvic form four&quot; by Stein and colleagues in 2017. This pelvis from the Riversleigh WHA is tentatively assigned to &quot;Quinkana meboldi&quot; primarily due to its specialized anatomy. Unlike the other pelvic forms discussed by Stein and colleagues (like those of &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Baru&quot;), pelvic form four indicates that the animal it belonged to had a pillar-erect stance and only a limited sprawling gait, similar to what is observed in sebecosuchians. However, while this interpretation would be a dead ringer for the habits inferred for &quot;Quinkana&quot; based on its skull, the lack of overlapping material means that the material cannot be confidently assigned to the genus until a skull is actually found in association with postcranial material.

The primary argument against a terrestrial lifestyle for &quot;Quinkana&quot; stems from a 2002 publication by Stephen Wroe. In this work, Wroe first argues against a prior argument by Molnar and Willis that reptiles were the top predators of Australia, highlighting the relative rarity of &quot;Megalania&quot; and &quot;Quinkana&quot; remains to those of marsupials. Wroe further argues that &quot;Quinkana&quot; would have been highly dependent on water for protection, mating or thermoregulation and claims that the hoof-like toes of planocraniids were an artifact of preservation. While the former point could still be applicable, the latter was eventually combated by Christopher Brochu, who confirmed the authenticity of that morphology. Naturally, Wroe&#x27;s arguments do not fully account for Stein&#x27;s &quot;pelvic form four&quot;, described 15 years later.

Overall, current consensus leans towards &quot;Quinkana&quot; having had more terrestrial habits, though postcranial material would be needed to fully confirm the hypothesis. Most researchers acknowledge the limited information that can be gathered from skull material alone.

===Ecology===
Across their existence mekosuchines filled a plethora of different niches in the freshwater ecosystems of Australia, evolving different skull shapes to exploit various food sources and minimize competition. This would have been especially valuable in environments such as the Oligocene and Miocene Riversleigh, where multiple different mekosuchines all inhabited the same areas at the same time.
Some mekosuchines, most prominently &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Australosuchus&quot;, possessed platyrostral mesorostrine skulls, meaning their heads were flattened and neither especially elongated nor shortened. This morphology, also seen in many modern crocodilians, is generally suited for a more generalist lifestyle, with these animals generally being thought to feed on a wide variety of prey items. &quot;Kambara&quot; is among the better studied of the two, with researchers having proposed that the differing types of tooth occlusions seen between species of this genus correlate to slightly altered prey preferences. Lucas A. Buchanan suggests that among the four &quot;Kambara&quot; species, those with interlocking teeth (&quot;K. implexidens&quot; and &quot;K. taraina&quot;) might be better adapted to grasp and restrain large struggling prey whereas the overbite seen in &quot;K. murgonensis&quot; could be employed to cut and slice. Buchanan further notes that among the species with interlocking dentition, &quot;K. taraina&quot; had an exceptionally well developed retroarticular process, corresponding to strong pterygoid muscles and thus a stronger bite. Additionally, the musculature used in holding and crushing were also well developed, leading to the hypothesis that &quot;Kambara taraina&quot; was especially well suited to tackle larger prey than its relatives. Despite this, little direct evidence of &quot;Kambara&quot; feeding habits exists, the one exception being a turtle shell bearing the distinct tooth marks of a crocodile found in the same sediments as the remains of &quot;Kambara&quot;. The patterns left on the turtle&#x27;s carapace suggest that &quot;Kambara&quot; engaged in behavior known as juggling, the act of repeatedly biting prey in a fashion that would align it with the teeth in the back of the jaw, allowing the animal to break through the robust shell. In the case of this particular fossil, the turtle appears to have survived the initial encounter only to die of an infection later.

This general bauplan is taken a step further by the large &quot;Paludirex&quot;, which also features a broad and flattened skull, although one that is notably more robust than those of &quot;Australosuchus&quot; and &quot;Kambara&quot;. Given that fact and the shere size of the larger of the two species, &quot;P. vincenti&quot;, it has been proposed that this genus was specialised in taking larger prey items than its relatives.

Another genus of mekosuchine specialised in taking larger prey is &quot;Baru&quot;, although its anatomy is strikingly different. Unlike the flattened skulls of &quot;Paludirex&quot;, &quot;Kambara&quot; and &quot;Australosuchus&quot;, the skull of &quot;Baru&quot; is described as deep (altirostral) and cleaver-like with long teeth bearing fine crenulations. These robust jaws, slicing teeth and the pronounced festooning might have aided &quot;Baru&quot; in tackling large prey items and dispatching it quickly by inflicting massive amounts of trauma. This hunting method contrasts strongly with the more typical approach of grabbing and drowning, possibly indicating a preference for shallower waters that would render the latter tactic less effective and more risky. Willis and colleagues speculate that &quot;Baru&quot; may have been able to tackle prey up to in weight and fossil evidence suggests that &quot;Baru&quot; fed on marsupials like &quot;Neohelos&quot; and flightless birds like &quot;Emuarius&quot; and &quot;Bullockornis&quot;.
Some of the most specialised anatomy can be seen in &quot;Quinkana&quot;, suggesting that the genus had a lifestyle drastically different from other mekosuchines. The teeth of &quot;Quinkana&quot; are ziphodont, resembling those of terrestrial sebecosuchians, planocraniids and monitor lizards, although their precise function is unclear. Molnar has argued that ziphodont dentition indicates an ability to tackle larger prey, terrestrial prey or possibly other crocodilians. Busbey and Willis both draw comparison to modern komodo dragons while Stein and colleagues suggest that ziphodont dentition might be tied to cursorial hunting habits, chasing after prey rather than ambushing it. Murray and Vickers-Rich take a similar approach, but conclude that &quot;Quinkana&quot; could have still ambushed prey on land, possibly by lying in wait near game trails.

Possibly the most enigmatic mekosuchines in terms of ecology are the dwarf taxa &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus&quot;. In the case of &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, the study of muscle attachments seems to indicate that rapid sideways movement of the head did play a part in its feeding method, but also showcases that it did not have to face the same resistances as semi-aquatic crocodilians, causing the muscles to be somewhat weaker. Similarly, &quot;Mekosuchus whitehunterensis&quot;&#x27; musculature has been in interpreted as an adaptation to rip flesh from carcasses, either through the same sideways movements as inferred for &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot; or by using the traditional crocodilian death roll, although it would have been notably less effective due to the small size of the animal. This would match the fact that shaking seems to be favored by small and juvenile individuals of modern crocodiles. This is further supported by specific adaptations to the muscle attachments in &quot;M. whitehunterensis&quot; and the simple fact that the inferred terrestrial habits of the animal would render a death roll much more dangerous if performed on land relative to in the water. Pulling and lifting might have also been a strategy employed by this animal, whether that be to strip the kills of other predators or to dismember its own kills is unclear.
There are further important differences between the Neogene mainland species like the aforementioned &quot;Mekosuchus whitehunterensis&quot; and the much more recent insular taxa like &quot;Mekosuchus inexpectatus&quot;. While the former possessed bladed teeth well suited for cutting flesh, the more recent forms appear to have developed more robust cheek teeth that appear more suited for dealing with hard-shelled prey items. This would include various crustaceans, insects and even molluscs like the snail &quot;Placostylus&quot;, which is especially common on New Caledonia. Drawing parallels to dwarf crocodiles and dwarf caimans, Holt and colleagues have suggested that these island forms could have been nocturnal animals, foraging at night near the edge of small streams and on land.

The posterior dentition of &quot;Volia&quot; from Fiji might have also been suited to cracking small molluscs and insect cuticles, tho its just as possible that it was a terrestrial hunter, employing its slender, compressed teeth to dispatch of the local giant iguanas and flightless birds.

Despite the broad spectrum of skull forms seen across mekosuchines, not a single taxon has yet been confidently identified as a narrow-snouted fish eater akin to modern gharials or freshwater crocodiles. While this morphology was once applied to &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, subsequent fossil finds have shown it to have been a much more generalized animal. &quot;Harpacochampsa&quot; meanwhile, historically placed within the family at times, has been more recently interpreted as a type of gharial not dissimilar to the later &quot;Gunggamarandu&quot;. There are multiple possible answers to this. On the one hand, it is simply possible that the presence of gharials prevented mekosuchines from trying to compete for this nische, which would not open until the disappearance of gharials during the Pliocene or Pleistocene and be filled by the narrow-snouted freshwater crocodiles. Another possibility is that piscivory and the associated adaptations would simply not have been a very viable ecology during the time. In the original description of &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, it is highlighted how despite the abundance of freshwater biomes, the Riversleigh WHA is poor in fossil fish, with the authors proposing that a narrow rostrum could have been used to catch frogs and other small vertebrates. Notably, the rostra of neither Australian gavialoid are known in full, making the extent of their presumptive longirostry unclear. Finally, a third hypothesis proposes that mekosuchines were simply incapable of developing long and narrow jaws. This may find its reason in the ontogeny of the animal. A similar situation is seen in alligators, in which certain constraints during development prevent them from evolving this type of head-shape.

== Paleoenvironment ==
Though the presence of salt glands has been used to explain both the spread of mekosuchines into Australia and their later appearance on islands in the Pacific, genera of this family are generally associated with freshwater environments. This is already apparent in the earliest members, with both &quot;Kambara murgonensis&quot; and &quot;K. implexidens&quot; having been recovered from the lacustrine Tingamarra Local Fauna. Given the relatively small size of the local fish, none of which exceed a meter in length, it is thought that the deposits represent a shallow lake, possibly a billabong. Though it is believed that &quot;Kambara&quot; was dependent on freshwater, evidence shows that the environment was subject to dry conditions, in once instance leading to a mass death event. The younger species &quot;K. taraina&quot; and &quot;K. molnari&quot;, although not sympatric like their relatives, inhabited the Rundle Formation, interpreted to represent lagoonal mudflats. Though the similarity has been used as an indicator for the fact that &quot;Kambara&quot; was restricted to freshwater, the genus may have nonetheless been more widespread, with Holt and colleagues speculating that the animal might have been common across the inland waterways of Queensland.

=== Riversleigh and Lake Eyre ===

Australian mekosuchines had spread much further inland by the late Oligocene, inhabiting the Riversleigh World Heritage Area of Queensland and Pwerte Marnte Marnte in the Northern Territory, as well as various other parts of the Lake Eyre Basin in southern Australia. The type of environment present within the Riversleigh has historically been a controversial subject, but seems to represent some type of woodland that appears to have undergone multiple shifts throughout the regions history. It has been suggested that Late Oligocene and Early Miocene localities (like Low Lion and Whitehunter, home of taxa like &quot;Ultrastenos&quot;, &quot;Mekosuchus whitehunterensis&quot;, &quot;Baru wickeni&quot; and &quot;Quinkana meboldi&quot;) would fall into a dry period, and were thus dominated by open forests and woodlands, possibly also featuring sclerophyllous vegetation and deciduous vine thickets. It is thought that the climate grew wetter during Faunal Zones B and C, leading to a more prominent lowland rainforest environment being present during the deposition of the Ringtail Site (home to &quot;Trilophosuchus&quot;, &quot;Baru darrowi&quot; and &quot;Mekosuchus sanderi&quot;). This interpretation of the environment is supported by various factors like the high number of arboreal taxa, overall species richness and the presence of certain rainforest taxa like bubble nesting frogs, lyrebirds and certain bats. Eventually, the environment appears to have returned to drier open woodlands and forests by the time the Riversleigh transitioned into Faunal Zone D.

The geology of Late Oligocene and Early Miocene sites heavily features lacustrine and fluviate calcarenites, which together with the fauna (featuring not only crocodilians but also turtles and lungfish) suggests an important aquatic component, though other studies have argued for the absence of extensive rivers and wetlands. Still, other bodies of water were clearly present, possibly in the form of forest ponds and lakes. Similar pools are also known from later sites within the Riversleigh, such as the Ringtail Site, which in addition to crocodilians also preserves the fossils of the extinct platypus &quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot;, lungfish and turtles, with the primary terrestrial component of the sites fauna consisting of arboreal possums that give the locality its name.
Other major Late Oligocene localities yielding mekosuchine material include the Etadunne, Namba and Wipajiri Formation of the South Australian Lake Eyre Basin. Like with the Riversleigh, the terrestrial environment has been described as tropical rainforest that was later replaced by dry sclerophyll forest. The aquatic environment was represented by widespread shallow lakes, which were home to a diverse assemblage of waterfowl. However, despite the environmental similarities to the Riversleigh and extensive bodies of freshwater, these southern formations only preserve a single mekosuchine: &quot;Australosuchus clarkae&quot;.

The stark contrast between the diverse mekosuchine fauna of the Riversleigh relative to the &quot;Australosuchus&quot;-dominated southern localities has led to some researchers to speculate on the reason for this divide. Initially, Willis hypothesized that this divide was caused by the localities being situated in different drainage basins, with the crocodilians unable to traverse enough land to spread from one to the other. This hypothesis however would later be debunked by Adam Yates, who described fossil material of &quot;Baru wickeni&quot; from the locality of Pwerte Marnte Marnte within the northern Lake Eyre Basin. Given that this proves the fact that both taxa did at least inhabit the same basin, another hypothesis for the apparent divide was proposed. Yates suggests that rather than being separated by some geographical barrier, the reason why &quot;Baru&quot; is restricted to the northern parts of Australia and vice versa lies in the climate of the continent. Yates notes that &quot;Baru&quot; is found no further south than 25°S while &quot;Australosuchus&quot;&#x27;s northernmost occurrence lies at 27°S. Furthermore, the southernmost records of &quot;Australosuchus&quot; stem from localities at a latitude of 31°S, which accounting for continental drift, would correspond to a latitude of 45° to 50°S during the Oligocene. This is a notably higher latitude than inhabited by any modern crocodilian and may suggest that &quot;Australosuchus&quot; was uniquely cold resistant.

=== Middle Miocene-Pleistocene sites ===
The Middle and Late Miocene record of mekosuchines is primarily known from the localities of Bullock Creek (Camfield Beds) and the Alcoota Fossil site respectively. The former has been interpreted as possible dry vine forest surrounded by scrublands and more open woodlands, situated amidst a larger floodplain that featured various freshwater systems such as slow-moving rivers, seasonally shallow lakes, ponds and oxbow sloughs, home to an extensive fauna of small fish and freshwater gastropods. Crocodilians were seemingly separated by habitat preferences, with the gavialoid &quot;Harpacochampsa&quot; found in deeper waters like parts of the meandering river and the oxbow sloughs while the mekosuchine &quot;Baru&quot; seemingly preferred slow-moving streams in accordance with the hunting style proposed by Willis and colleagues. Alcoota shares much of its fauna with Bullock Creek, but is notably younger and shows a noticeable drop in freshwater and streambank taxa, which went from making up about half of the Bullock Creek fauna to only about a fourth of Alcoota&#x27;s, a decline likely tied to the continuous aridification of Australia during this time. Still, the locality is thought to have been lacustrine in nature, featuring permanent bodies of water fed by springs that in times of increased rainfall may have expanded to form an enormous but very shallow lake. The terrestrial biomes of Alcoota may have featured savannah and localized forests according to Murray and Megirian, while Mao and Retallack propose that the environment was primarily composed of open woodlands and gallery forest, with grasses being fairly rare.
One thing showcased by both localities is the impact of the climate change that Australia faced during the Miocene. The presence of certain minerals, namely evaporites and lithoclastic carbonate deposits, seems to suggest that Bullock Creek underwent periods of dry, possibly even semi-arid conditions. The deposits further indicate that these minerals were not formed in a single event, but rather sequentially, possibly due to seasonally changing conditions causing droughts. Similarly, though spring-fed, the freshwater systems of Alcoota were likewise ephemeral and threatened by droughts. The fossil preservation supports this idea, with some remains at Alcoota seemingly deposited during &quot;waterhole tethering&quot;, when animals would concentrate and die around slowly shrinking bodies of water, with survivors crushing the remains of the deceased. It is hypothesized that one especially severe period of aridification was responsible for the extinction of most Oligocene and Miocene mekosuchine groups towards the end of the Miocene.

Mekosuchines did however survive this period in less affected areas of Australia and diversified once more during the Pliocene. Taxa of this time period include &quot;Paludirex&quot; and &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; as well as &quot;Quinkana&quot;, which survived the Miocene-Pliocene faunal turnover. However, with the exception of the potentially more terrestrial &quot;Quinkana&quot;, these new forms remained highly dependent on freshwater. Pliocene mekosuchines are known from Bluff Downs (Allingham Formation) in Queensland, among other places. Bluff Downs has been interpreted as preserving an environment similar to today&#x27;s Kakadu National Park, with Thomson and Mackness proposing suggesting the presence of riparian rainforests or vine thickets. Aquatic environments possibly consisted of rivers, creeks and lagoons as indicated by the presence of several species of chelid turtles, anhingas and pygmy geese. Further south, the Lake Eyre Basin also continued to support mekosuchine populations, sharing &quot;Quinkana&quot; with Bluff Downs and also preserving the bones of &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; as the regions semi-aquatic crocodilian. The Tirari Formation is noticeably drier than the environment of the underlying Miocene formations inhabited by &quot;Australosuchus&quot;, but nonetheless much wetter than the region is today. It may have housed fan-deltas, lakes and floodplains, and was home to many freshwater taxa beyond the crocodilians, including ducks, flamingos, anhingas, cormorants, egrets and pelicans. Still, the Tirari Formation exemplifies the aridification of Australia, with its freshwater bodies less extensive than the lakes of the Etadunna and Namba Formations that preceded it. The Tirari Formation and &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; are furthermore key examples for the threat that aridification continued to pose to mekosuchines, with the type locality of &quot;Kalthifrons&quot; representing a watering hole that dried up in a drought, killing the aquatic taxa that lived in it.

During the Pleistocene, aridification caused another extinction event among mekosuchines. Given the groups preference for the inland freshwater systems of Australia, the collapse of said systems and associated change to more open environments wiped out both semi-aquatic taxa like &quot;Paludirex&quot; as well as the more terrestrial &quot;Quinkana&quot;. Though rainfall eventually increased again, settling on the levels of precipitation seen today, this was too late to save &quot;Australia&quot;&#x27;s inland freshwater systems.

Animals like &quot;Mekosuchus inexpectatus&quot; were the last mekosuchines, and inhabited the tropical islands of the South Pacific like Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia. They may have lived in the rainforests of these islands, spending their life in or close to small rainforest streams.

<doc id="1196618" wikidata="Q12058359" url="?curid=1196618" title="Robert Garran">
<text>Sir Robert Randolph Garran (10 February 1867 – 11 January 1957) was an Australian lawyer who became &quot;Australia&#x27;s first public servant&quot; – the first federal government employee after the federation of the Australian colonies. He served as the departmental secretary of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department from 1901 to 1932, and after 1916 also held the position of Solicitor-General of Australia.

Garran was born in Sydney, the son of the journalist and politician Andrew Garran. He studied arts and law at the University of Sydney and was called to the bar in 1891. Garran was a keen supporter of the federation movement, and became acquainted with leading federalists like George Reid and Edmund Barton. At the 1897–98 constitutional convention he served as secretary of the drafting committee. On 1 January 1901, Garran was chosen by Barton&#x27;s caretaker government as its first employee; for a brief period, he was the only member of the Commonwealth Public Service. His first duty was to write the inaugural edition of the &quot;Commonwealth Gazette&quot;, which contained Queen Victoria&#x27;s proclamation authorising the creation of a federal government.

Over the following three decades, Garran provided legal advice to ten different prime ministers, from Barton to Joseph Lyons. He was considered an early expert in Australian constitutional law, and with John Quick published an annotated edition of the constitution that became a standard reference work. Garran developed a close relationship with Billy Hughes during World War I, and accompanied him to the Imperial War Cabinet and the Paris Peace Conference. Hughes, who was simultaneously prime minister and attorney-general, appointed him to the new position of solicitor-general and delegated numerous powers and responsibilities to him. He was knighted three times for his service to the Commonwealth, in 1917, in 1920 and in 1937.

In addition to his professional work, Garran was also an important figure in the development of the city of Canberra during its early years. He was one of the first public servants to relocate there after it replaced Melbourne as the capital in 1927. He founded several important cultural associations, organised the creation of the Canberra University College, and later contributed to the establishment of the Australian National University. Garran published at least eight books and many journal articles throughout his lifetime, covering such topics as constitutional law, the history of federalism in Australia, and German-language poetry. He was granted a state funeral upon his death in 1957, the first federal public servant to receive one.

==Early life==
Garran was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the only son (among seven children) of journalist and politician Andrew Garran and his wife Mary Isham. His parents were both devout and committed to social justice, Mary campaigning for issues such as the promotion of education for women. Andrew had studied to become a church minister before becoming a journalist, with one biographer summing him up as &quot;Congregationalist, Conservative, Liberal Reformer.&quot; He advocated free trade and Federation while editor of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and later promoted these ideas as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council.

The family lived in Phillip Street in central Sydney. Garran&#x27;s mother &quot;had a deep distrust, well justified in those days, of milkman&#x27;s milk&quot; and so she kept a cow in the backyard, which would walk on its own to The Domain each day to graze and return twice a day to be milked. The Garrans later lived in the suburb of Darlinghurst, just to the east of the centre of the city.

Garran attended Sydney Grammar School from the age of ten, starting in 1877. He was a successful student, and became School Captain in 1884. He then studied arts and law at the University of Sydney, where he was awarded scholarships for classics, mathematics and general academic ability. Garran graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1888 and subsequently won the University&#x27;s Medal in Philosophy when he was conferred with a Master of Arts with first-class honours in 1899.

After graduating, Garran began to study for the Bar examination. He was employed for a year with a firm of Sydney solicitors, and in 1890 served as associate to Justice William Charles Windeyer of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Windeyer had a reputation for being a harsh and inflexible judge, particularly in criminal cases, where he was said to have &quot;a rigorous and unrelenting sense of the retribution that he believed criminal justice demanded, [and] a sympathy verging on the emotional for the victims of crime.&quot; Garran however offered a different view, saying that &quot;those who knew him well knew that under a brusque exterior he was the kindest of men&quot;, and his reputation had to some degree been created by misrepresentation. In 1891, Garran was admitted to the New South Wales Bar, where he commenced practice as a barrister, primarily working in equity.

==Federation movement==

Garran, like his father, was strongly involved in the Australian Federation movement, the movement which sought to unite the British colonies in Australia (and, in early proposals, New Zealand) into one federated country. The first Constitutional Convention was held in 1891 in the chamber of the Legislative Council of New South Wales in Macquarie Street, Sydney, around the corner from Garran&#x27;s chambers in Phillip Street; Garran regularly attended and sat in the public gallery to see &quot;history... in the making under my very eyes.&quot; Garran later recalled with approval that the 1891 convention was the first with the courage to face the &quot;lion in the path&quot;, the issue of customs duties and tariffs, which had previously divided states such as Victoria, who were in favour of protectionism, and states such as New South Wales, who were in favour of free trade. In Garran&#x27;s view a clause proposed at the convention, which allowed for tariffs against international trade while ensuring free trade domestically (the predecessor to the final section 92 of the Constitution of Australia), &quot;expressed the terms on which New South Wales was prepared to face the lion.&quot;

On joining the bar soon became involved with Edmund Barton Q.C., later the first Prime Minister of Australia, and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the federation movement in New South Wales. Garran, along with others such as Atlee Hunt, worked essentially as secretaries to Barton&#x27;s federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, Barton expressed the phrase &quot;For the first time, we have a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation&quot;; Garran later claimed that the now famous phrase &quot;would have been unrecorded if I had not happened to jot it down.&quot;

In June 1893, when Barton&#x27;s Australasian Federal League was formed at a meeting in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined immediately and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League&#x27;s four delegates to the 1893 Corowa Conference and a League delegate to the 1896 &quot;People&#x27;s Convention&quot;, or Bathurst Conference, a conference attended by Barton, Reid, League members, the Australian Natives&#x27; Association (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling for a directly elected Constitutional Convention to be charged with drafting the Bill for the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which came to be known as the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers&#x27; Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.

In 1897, Garran published &quot;The Coming Commonwealth&quot;, an influential book on the history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the Premier of New South Wales George Reid, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton&#x27;s request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.

Garran recorded in a letter to his family during the convention&#x27;s Melbourne sitting that:

The committee professes to find me very useful in unravelling the conundrums sent down by the finance committee... The last two nights I have found the drafting committee fagged [tired] and despairing, and now they have pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out algebraic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.

Garran joked that the long work of the drafting committee breached the &quot;Factory Acts&quot;, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O&#x27;Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working late into the night preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention&#x27;s last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, became the Constitution of Australia.

Throughout 1898, following the completion of the proposed Constitution, Garran participated in the campaign promoting Federation leading up to the referendums at which the people of the colonies voted whether or not to approve the Constitution. He contributed a daily column to the &quot;Evening News&quot;, and had humorous poems critiquing opponents of federation published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. The following year, he began working with Quick on the &quot;Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth&quot;, a reference work on the Constitution including a history, and detailed discussion of each section analysing its meaning and its development at the Conventions. Published in 1901, the &quot;Annotated Constitution&quot;, commonly referred to simply as &quot;Quick &amp; Garran&quot;, soon became the standard work on the Constitution and is still regarded as one of the most important works on the subject.

==Public service==
On the day that Federation was completed and Australia created, 1 January 1901, Garran, feeling like &quot; a junior barrister suddenly promoted to the final court of appeal&quot;, was appointed secretary and Permanent Head of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department by the first Attorney-General of Australia, Alfred Deakin. Garran was the first, and for a time the only, public servant employed by the Government of Australia. Garran later said of this time that:

I was not only the head [of the department], but the tail. I was my own clerk and messenger. My first duty was to write out with my own hand Commonwealth Gazette No. 1 proclaiming the establishment of the Commonwealth and the appointment of ministers of state, and to send myself down with it to the government printer.
In this role, Garran was responsible for organising the first federal election in March 1901, and for organising the transfer of various government departments from the states to the federal government, including the Department of Defence, the postal and telegraphic services (now part of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) and the Department of Trade and Customs (now part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). As parliamentary drafter, Garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation. As head of the Attorney General&#x27;s department, Garran was also responsible for advice on the consistency of legislation with the Constitution, including the &quot;Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902&quot; which by disenfranchising Aboriginals appeared to offend the Constitution&#x27;s Section 41, which guaranteed the right to vote federally of anyone entitled to vote in a state. Garran advised that the Section could be neutered by interpreting it as no more than a grandfather clause of the right to vote of existing Aboriginal voters. The Act also conferred the right to vote on women federally, a cause Garran was, in private, gently mocking of.

Garran and his fellow staff aimed for a simple style of legislative drafting, a goal enabled by the fact that there was no pre-existing federal legislation on which their work would have to be based. In Garran&#x27;s opinion the approach, which was put into practice many years before the similarly principled plain English movement became popular in government in the 1970s, was intended &quot;to set an example of clear, straightforward language, free from technical jargon.&quot; Subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that Garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style, and that it was not until the early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re-emerged.

However, Garran himself admitted that his drafting could be overly simplistic, citing the first customs and excise legislation, developed with the Minister for Trade and Customs Charles Kingston and Assistant Parliamentary Draftsman Gordon Castle, as an example of the style taken to excess. The style was also once parodied by foundation High Court Justice Richard O&#x27;Connor as follows:

Every man shall wear –
  (a) Coat
  (b) Vest
  (c) Trousers
Penalty: £100.
The Attorney-General&#x27;s Department also managed litigation on behalf of the government. Initially the department contracted private law firms to actually conduct the litigation, but in 1903 the office of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor was established, with Charles Powers the first to hold the job. The other Crown Solicitors that Garran worked with were Gordon Castle (with whom he had also worked as a drafter) and William Sharwood. In 1912, Garran was considered as a possible appointee to the High Court, following the expansion of the bench from five seats to seven and the death of Richard O&#x27;Connor. Billy Hughes, Attorney-General in the Fisher government at the time, later said Garran would have been appointed &quot;but for the fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose. We cannot spare him.&quot;

Garran worked with eleven Attorneys-General as Permanent Head of the Department. Garran regarded the first Attorney-General, Alfred Deakin, as an excellent thinker and a natural lawyer, and on occasion &quot;[spoke] of Deakin as the Balfour of Australian politics.&quot; He was also very much impressed with the fifth Attorney-General, Isaac Isaacs, who was an extremely diligent worker, and two time Attorney-General Littleton Groom, who was &quot;probably one of the most useful Ministers the Commonwealth has had.&quot;

===Solicitor-General===
In 1916, Garran was made the first Solicitor-General of Australia by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister as well as Attorney-General. The creation of the office and Garran&#x27;s appointment to it represented a formal delegation of many of the powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.

Garran developed a strong relationship with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the World War I conscription plebiscites and on the range of regulations which were made under the &quot;War Precautions Act 1914&quot;. The &quot;War Precautions Regulations&quot; had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to the reach of the Commonwealth&#x27;s defence power during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran&#x27;s work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy Central Powers living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a German man, the band had played &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot;, Hughes asked Garran &quot;By the way, what is this tune?&quot; to which Garran replied that it was Haydn&#x27;s melody to &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser&quot;, and as it was used as the tune to several hymns &quot;it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday.&quot; Hughes then said &quot;Good Heavens! I have played that thing with one finger hundreds of times.&quot;

The partnership between Garran and Hughes is regarded by some as unusual, given that Garran was &quot;tall, gentlemanly, wise and scholarly&quot;, and patient with his staff, whereas Hughes was &quot;short of stature [and] renowned for bursts of temper.&quot; Nevertheless, the partnership was a successful one, with Hughes recognising the importance of Garran&#x27;s constitutional expertise, remarking once about the World War I period that &quot;the best way to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at [my] elbow, with a fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper, and the &quot;War Precautions Act&quot;.&quot; Likewise, Garran respected Hughes&#x27; strong leadership style, which had been important in guiding the country through the war, although in describing the Nationalist Party&#x27;s loss in the 1922 federal election, Garran later said that &quot;Hughes also overestimated his own hold on Parliament [although] his hold on the people was probably undiminished.&quot;

Garran accompanied Hughes and Joseph Cook (then the Minister for the Navy) to the 1917 and 1918 meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet in London, United Kingdom, and was also part of the British Empire delegation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference in Paris, France. There he was on several of the treaty drafting committees, and contributed to many provisions, notably the portions of the League of Nations Covenant relating to League of Nations mandates. Though focusing mainly on League of Nations matters, Garran and John Latham (the head of Australian Naval Intelligence) had the status of technical advisers to Hughes and Cook, and so could attend the main conference and any of the associated councils. Observing the proceedings, Garran admired the &quot;moral and physical courage&quot; of French premier Georges Clemenceau, whom he regarded as determined to protect France from Germany but in a measured and temperate way; in Garran&#x27;s words, Clemenceau &quot;always withstood the excessive demands of the French chauvinists, of the French army, and of Foch himself&quot;. Garran viewed some similarities between British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and United States President Woodrow Wilson where others saw only differences, since Lloyd George &quot;also had a strong vein of idealism in his character&quot;, and Wilson could be pragmatic when the situation called for it, such as in discussions relating to American interests. Garran also met other political and military leaders at the conference, including T. E. Lawrence, &quot;an Oxford youth of 29 – he looks 18&quot;, who was modest and &quot;without any affectation... in a company of two or three [he] could talk very interestingly, but at a larger gathering he was apt to be dumb.&quot;

Following the war, Garran worked with Professor Harrison Moore of the University of Melbourne and South Australian judge Professor Jethro Brown on a report about proposed constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put forward in the 1919 referendum. Garran attended two Imperial Conferences, accompanying Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister James Scullin and Attorney-General Frank Brennan, chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as merchant shipping. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in Geneva, Switzerland. At the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1927, Garran gave evidence over five days, where he discussed the history and origins of the Constitution and the evolution of the institutions established under it.

Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Garran prepared annual summaries of legislative developments in Australia, highlighting important individual pieces of legislation for the &quot;Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law&quot;.

Towards the end of his time as Solicitor-General, Garran&#x27;s work included the preparation of the Debt Conversion Agreement between the Government of Australia and the governments of the states, which involved the federal government taking over and managing the debts of the individual states, following the 1928 referendum. In 1930, he was asked by the Scullin government to provide an opinion on whether Norman Lindsay&#x27;s novel &quot;Redheap&quot; was indecent and obscene within the terms of section 52(c) of the &quot;Customs Act 1901&quot;. He concluded that it was, and the Department of Trade and Customs subsequently banned the book from being imported into Australia, the first book by an Australian author to suffer such a ban. It has been suggested that Frank Forde, the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, had already decided to ban the book, and sought Garran&#x27;s advice primarily as a buffer against political criticism.

==Personal life and retirement==
In 1902, Garran married Hilda Robson. Together they had four sons, Richard (born 1903), John (1905), Andrew (1906) and Isham Peter (1910). At this time the family lived in Melbourne, and the boys all attended Melbourne Grammar School and later studied at the University of Melbourne, attending Trinity College there.

In 1927, Garran had moved from his home in Melbourne to the newly established capital Canberra, one of the first public officials to do so (many government departments and their public servants did not move to Canberra until after World War II). He also worked within the Government to facilitate housing in Canberra for officials who needed to move there from other cities, and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in the city. In 1928 he was the inaugural President of the Canberra Rotary Club. In 1929, he formed the Canberra University Association in order to promote the formation of a university in Canberra, and in 1930 organised the establishment of Canberra University College (essentially a campus of the University of Melbourne) which taught undergraduate courses, chairing its council for its first twenty-three years. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Garran &quot;consistently advocated the establishment of what he prophetically called &#x27;a National University at Canberra&#x27; &quot;, which would be primarily for specialist research and postgraduate study, in areas particularly relating to Australia, such as foreign relations with Asia and the Pacific region. This vision was evidently influential on the establishment of the Australian National University (ANU) in 1946, the only research-only university in the country (although in 1960 it amalgamated with Canberra University College to offer undergraduate courses).

Garran retired from his governmental positions on 9 February 1932, a fixed retirement date on the day before his sixty-fifth birthday. He soon returned to practise as a barrister, and within a month he was made a King&#x27;s Counsel. However, he occasionally carried out more prominent work. In 1932, he was selected on the advice of the then Attorney-General John Latham to chair the Indian Defence Expenditure Tribunal, to advise on the dispute between India and the United Kingdom regarding the costs of the military defence of India. In 1934, along with John Keating, William Somerville and David John Gilbert, he formed a committee which prepared &quot;The Case for Union&quot;, the Government of Australia&#x27;s official reply to the secessionist movement in the state of Western Australia.

Garran served on ANU&#x27;s council from 1946 until 1951. Garran was also involved with the arts; he was a founding member of the Australian Institute of Arts and Literature and its president 1922-1927. He was the vice-president of the Canberra Musical Society, where he sang and played the clarinet, and in 1946 won a national song competition run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Garran also published translations of Heinrich Heine&#x27;s 1827 work &quot;Buch der Lieder&quot; (&quot;Book of Songs&quot;) in 1924, and of the works of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann in 1946. 

He was known to be a great lover of poetry and languages. Geoffrey Sawer, the ANU Law professor, believed Garran had brought his quiet religious faith to bear in his life of service:&quot;The Commonwealth was fortunate in having through so much of its early history the services of such a man—superbly intelligent, with great practical commonsense, a Christian both in moral rectitude and in loving-kindness, selfless, devoid of any faintest touch of arrogance, priggishness or conceit, with a sense both of humour and of fun.&quot;Garran died in 1957 in Canberra. He was granted a state funeral, the first given to a public servant of the Government of Australia, and was buried at St John&#x27;s, Reid. He was survived by his four sons; his wife Hilda had died in 1936. His memoirs, &quot;Prosper the Commonwealth&quot;, were published posthumously in 1958, having been completed shortly before his death.

==Legacy==
Garran&#x27;s &quot;personality, like his prose, was devoid of pedantry and pomposity and, though dignified, was laced with a quizzical turn of humour.&quot; His death &quot;marked the end of a generation of public men for whom the cultural and the political were natural extensions of each other and who had the skills and talents to make such connections effortlessly.&quot;

Garran&#x27;s friend Charles Studdy Daley, a long time civic administrator of the Australian Capital Territory, emphasised Garran&#x27;s contribution to the early development of the city of Canberra, particularly its cultural life, remarking at a celebratory dinner for Garran in 1954 that:

&quot;There has hardly been a cultural movement in this city with which Sir Robert has not been identified in loyal and inspiring support, as his constant aim has been that Canberra should be not only a great political centre but also a shrine to foster those things that stimulate and enrich our national life... his name will ever be inscribed in the annals, not only of Canberra, but of the Commonwealth as &quot;clarum et venerabile nomen gentibus&quot;.
However Garran is perhaps best remembered as an expert on constitutional law, more so than for his other contributions to public service. At his death, Garran was one of the last remaining of the people involved with the creation of the Constitution of Australia. On his experience of Federation and the Constitution, Garran was always enthusiastic:

&quot;I&#x27;m often asked &#x27;has federation turned out as you expected?&#x27; Well yes and no. By and large the sort of thing we expected has happened but with differences. We knew the constitution was not perfect; it had to be a compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the unforeseen [sic] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much as we thought it would. I think it now needs revision, to meet the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of six disunited Australian colonies.&quot;
Former Prime Minister John Howard, in describing Garran, said:

&quot;I wonder though if we sometimes underestimate the changes, excitements, disruptions and adjustments previous generations have experienced. Sir Robert Garran knew the promise and reality of federation. He was part of the establishment of a public service which, in many ways, is clearly recognisable today.&quot;
At one level, Garran&#x27;s remarkable career epitomises the hay day, or Indian Summer, of the meritocratic bourgeois elite born in Australia in the third quarter of the 19th century. At another level, his exceptional influence as an eminence grise bespeaks his fluency in construction, be it in poetry translation or legislative drafts, even if always out of commonplace materials. He lacked the imagination to range beyond the stock assumptions of the day regarding race, sex and Empire, assumptions he fully shared. This, inevitably, only made his influence stronger.

==Honours==
Garran was made a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on the day that Federation was completed and Australia created, 1 January 1901, &quot;in recognition of services in connection with the Federation of Australian Colonies and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;,

Garran was first knighted in 1917, and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920. He was knighted a third time in 1937 when he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

Shortly after the establishment of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952.

=== Memorials ===
Garran&#x27;s influence on Canberra is remembered by the naming of the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, established in 1966, after him. Garran&#x27;s link with ANU is remembered by the naming of a chair in the university&#x27;s School of Law, by the naming of the hall of residence Burton &amp; Garran Hall, and by the naming of Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with that school. The Garran oration, established to honour his memory, has been given yearly since 1959.

In 1983, the former Patent Office building – then occupied by the Federal Attorney General&#x27;s Department – was renamed Robert Garran Offices. It was renamed the Robert Marsden Hope Building in 2011.

<text>Garfield is a town in Victoria, Australia, 79 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Cardinia local government area. Garfield recorded a population of 2,114 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The area was originally called Cannibal Creek, but was renamed to Garfield in memory of the U.S. President James A. Garfield.

The Post Office opened as Cannibal Creek on 1 May 1886 and was renamed Garfield in 1887, though this had not been the first choice of the local community.

==Garfield today==

Garfield has a primary school with approximately 150 students. There is a church at the top end of the schoolgrounds. Local businesses include a newsagency, a sourdough bakery, women’s clothing shop, an opportunity shop, gifts and homewares shop, butcher, hairdressers, and several cafes. 

It is also home to the Garfield Picture Theatre, Cardinia Shire’s first cinema in the region. The theatre was built in 1924, and was the town’s first source of electricity. Today, it’s one of the few picture theatre buildings remaining in the shire and hosts monthly concerts. 

The town has an Australian Rules football team playing in the Ellinbank and District Football League. Garfield has an undulating golf course on Thirteen Mile Road run by the Garfield Golf Club.

As at 2021, the population of Garfield was 2,114 (50.6% male, 49.4% female). The median age was 39. 

Garfield hosts two annual community festivals: the Garfield Christmas Festival in December, and the West Gippsland Railtowns Food and Wine Festival in March. Both events bring thousands of visitors to the town to enjoy local food and entertainment.

<text>Garfield railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Garfield, in Victoria, Australia. Garfield station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 17 December 1884.

Initially opened as Cannibal Creek Siding, the station was given its current name of Garfield on 28 March 1887, after other suggested names from locals were rejected.

==History==

The station was destroyed by fire on 20 February 1924. In 1954, electrification of the line was provided between Pakenham and Warragul, and in 1956, the line between Tynong and Bunyip was duplicated, with a new down platform (Platform 2) provided.

In 1971, a crossover at the station was abolished, and in 1978, the up end connection to the siding was abolished. The siding was abolished altogether in 1987.

In 1998, electrified services between Pakenham and Warragul ceased, with de-electrification between those stations occurring in 2001.

==Platforms and services==

Garfield has two side platforms. It is serviced by V/Line Traralgon and Bairnsdale line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale

==Transport links==

Warragul Bus Lines operates three routes to and from Garfield station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
*to Nar Nar Goon station
*to Pakenham station
*to Traralgon Plaza

<doc id="1196630" wikidata="Q3454432" url="?curid=1196630" title="Hysterical realism">
<text>Hysterical realism is a term coined in 2000 by English critic James Wood to describe what he sees as a literary genre typified by a strong contrast between elaborately absurd prose, plotting, or characterization, on the one hand, and careful, detailed investigations of real, specific social phenomena on the other. It is also known as recherché postmodernism.

==History==
Wood introduced the term in an essay on Zadie Smith&#x27;s &quot;White Teeth&quot;, which appeared in the July 24, 2000, issue of &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Wood uses the term pejoratively to denote the contemporary conception of the &quot;big, ambitious novel&quot; that pursues &quot;vitality at all costs&quot; and consequently &quot;knows a thousand things but does not know a single human being.&quot;

He decried the genre as an attempt to &quot;turn fiction into social theory,&quot; and an attempt to tell readers &quot;how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something.&quot; Wood points to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon as the forefathers of the genre, which continues, Wood says, in writers like David Foster Wallace. In response, Zadie Smith described &quot;hysterical realism&quot; as a &quot;painfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own &quot;White Teeth&quot; and a few others [Wood] was sweet enough to mention&quot;. Smith qualified the term, though, explaining that &quot;any collective term for a supposed literary movement is always too large a net, catching significant dolphins among so much cannable tuna.&quot; She also noted: David Foster Wallace&#x27;s mammoth beast &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; was heaved in as an exemplum, but it is five years old, and is a world away from his delicate, entirely &#x27;human&#x27; short stories and essays of the past two years, which shy away from the kind of totalizing theoretical and thematic arcs that Wood was gunning for. If anyone has recently learned a lesson about the particularities of human existence and their separation from social systems, it is Wallace.

Wood&#x27;s line of argument echoes many common criticisms of postmodernist art generally. In particular, Wood&#x27;s attacks on DeLillo and Pynchon clearly echo similar criticisms other critics had already lodged against them a generation earlier. The &quot;hysterical&quot; prose style is often paired with &quot;realistic&quot;—almost journalistic—effects, such as Pynchon&#x27;s depiction of 18th century land surveys in &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, and Don DeLillo&#x27;s treatment of Lee Harvey Oswald in &quot;Libra&quot;.

Yet as Zadie Smith notes, People continue to manage this awesome trick of wrestling sentiment away from TV&#x27;s colonization of all things soulful and human, and I would applaud all the youngish Americans—Franzen, Moody, Foster Wallace, Eggers, Moore for their (supposedly) small but, to me, significant triumphs. They work to keep both sides of the equation—brain and heart—present in their fiction.
Even if you find them obtuse, they can rarely be accused of cliché...

== Works ==
Some books described as examples of hysterical realism are:
* 
* 
* 
* Eggers, Dave (2000). &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;.
* Fuguet, Alberto (2000). &quot;The Movies of My Life.&quot;
*

<text>Bunyip railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Bunyip, in Victoria, Australia. Bunyip station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 October 1877, with the current station provided in 2024.

A substation and a short section of the overhead wiring, both of which are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, have been retained to the west of the station. 

==History==
The line through Bunyip was electrified in July 1954, but the electrification was switched off between Bunyip and Warragul in December 1998, and between Pakenham and Bunyip in 2005, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project. The track up to the western (up) end of the station was duplicated in 1956.

On 26 August 1988, the electric staff system between Bunyip and Longwarry was abolished, and was replaced with automatic three-position signalling. The signal box, interlocking, and all two-position signals, were also abolished.

The station was de-staffed on 26 May 1991.

In 2022, as part of the Regional Rail Revival project, the former goods and stock platform and crane were removed to make way for duplicated track and a new second platform. The siding for the goods platform was removed in April 1988.

In April 2017, the Victorian state government announced an upgrade project to the Gippsland line as part of the Regional Rail Revival package. A second platform would be constructed at Bunyip, along with duplicated track from Bunyip to Longwarry. However, it was reported in May 2022, that track would not be duplicated over the Bunyip River. The new platform, renumbered to Platform 1, opened on 13 June 2024. The original platform was renumbered to Platform 2.

==Platforms and services==
Bunyip has two platforms both served by V/Line Traralgon and selected Bairnsdale line trains.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale

<doc id="1196634" wikidata="Q1764511" url="?curid=1196634" title="G7">
<text>The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental political and economic forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States; additionally, the European Union (EU) is a &quot;non-enumerated member&quot;. It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government. G7 members are major IMF advanced economies. 

Originating from an &quot;ad hoc&quot; gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change. Each member&#x27;s head of government or state, along with the EU&#x27;s Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.

The G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group&#x27;s priorities and hosting the summit; Canada presides for 2025. While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence; it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness. The rise of BRICS+ for example, with its expanded membership and focus on South-South cooperation, reflects a broader shift in global power dynamics, with emerging economies gaining greater influence in international affairs.

The G7 countries have together a population of about 780 million people (or almost 10% of the world population), comprise around 50% of worldwide nominal net wealth and as of 2024 about 30% of world GDP (as by purchasing power parity) and more than 44% of nominal gross domestic product.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The concept of a forum for the capitalist world&#x27;s major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the United States secretary of the treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, DC. United States president Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor; the original group of four consequently became known as the &quot;Library Group&quot;. In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted. The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the &quot;Group of Five&quot;.

In 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in leadership. French president Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a fresh presidential election that was closely won by Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. West German chancellor Willy Brandt, American president Richard Nixon, and Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon&#x27;s successor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group&#x27;s new leaders to learn about one another.

=== First summit and expansion ===

At the initiative of Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the &quot;Group of Six&quot; (G6). Taking place at the Château de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession. The result was the 15-point &quot;Declaration of Rambouillet&quot;, which, among other positions, announced the group&#x27;s united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc. The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.

In 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the first G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group needed an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for inviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight yearssignificantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest advanced economy after the G6 members. The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later that year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).

In 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year&#x27;s summit, invited the European Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has attended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union. Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the President of the European Council, who serves as the Union&#x27;s principal foreign representative, also regularly attends the summits.

=== Rising profile ===

Until the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments&#x27; finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqué issued afterward. The 1980s also marked the G7&#x27;s expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.

Following the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the &quot;Political 8&quot; (P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a full participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the next meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight (G8). Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national wealth and financial weight of other members, and at the time was not an established liberal democracy. Its invitation, made during a difficult transition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international engagement.

Russia&#x27;s membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea. Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country, and in subsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian participation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave the G8, which came into effect June 2018. In 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia&#x27;s return; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no interest.

== Renewed calls for expanded membership ==
There have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls &quot;leading democracies&quot; which support a &quot;rules-based democratic order&quot;, consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countriesincluding India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain participate as observers. Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group; This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.

In 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.

In 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia. The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.

Also in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a &quot;T-12&quot; of &quot;Techno Democracies&quot;. Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI&#x27;s initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.

Boris Johnson invited representatives of Australia and the Republic of Korea to the June 2021 G7 summit. India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an aim to &quot;deepen the expertise and experience around the table&quot; along with the other guests, according to a U.K. government statement.

In 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Garner de Béville, a member of the &quot;Cercle Montesquieu&quot;, proposed Spain&#x27;s membership to the G7. American Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States &quot;enthusiastically supports&quot; a &quot;greater&quot; role of Spanish leadership at the international level.

In April 2022, Germany confirmed it would be inviting India, against rumours to the contrary.

In March 2023, Japan&#x27;s prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, the Comoros (African Union president from February 2023 to February 2024), the Cook Islands (Pacific Islands Forum president from February 2021 to May 2024) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.

Ronald A. Klain writing for the Carnegie Endowment, proposed creating the G9 by adding South Korea and Australia due to the Eurocentrism of the current alliance and rising challenges posed by China in Asia.

==Activities and initiatives==

The G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession. Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency; since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.

Beginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC); provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl; and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in &quot;managing the international monetary system&quot;.

At the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the developing world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a similar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including the European Union), in order to &quot;promote dialogue between major industrial and emerging market countries&quot;; the G20 has been touted by some of its members as a replacement for the G7. Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90% of bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7 announced debt reductions of &quot;up to 100%&quot; to be negotiated on a &quot;case by case&quot; basis.

Following the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, which was the worst of its kind since the 1970s, the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008 and in Rome, the following February. News media reported that much of the world was looking to the group for leadership and solutions. G7 finance ministers pledged to take &quot;all necessary steps&quot; to stem the crisis, devising an &quot;aggressive action plan&quot; that included providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of failing. Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that individual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather than cohere around a united effort.

In subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility, or propose its replacement by the G20. On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its &quot;violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine&quot; through its military intervention. The group also announced its commitment to &quot;mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges&quot;, while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country&#x27;s finances and economy.

In response to Russia&#x27;s subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7 convened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen because all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting neither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader participating in the meeting. The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was moved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned Moscow for its &quot;continuing violation&quot; of Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty and stated they were prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia. This meeting was the first since Russia was suspended from the G8, and subsequently it has not been involved in any G7 summit.

The G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia&#x27;s &quot;destabilising behaviour and malign activities&quot; in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world, following the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K. The group also called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched from within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The June 2021 summit also saw the G7 commit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action against climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote &quot;shared values&quot; of pluralism and democracy.

In 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO called in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In April 2024, the G7 countries agreed to close all coal power plants in 2030-2035 unless their greenhouse gases will be captured or the countries will find another way to align their emissions with the 1.5 degree pathway.

=== 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil ===

The G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a &quot;relatively small amount&quot; given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation. Soon after, Germany and the United Kingdom criticized the threat.

=== Summit organization ===
The annual G7 summit is attended by each member&#x27;s head of government. The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year&#x27;s summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series. Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.

Besides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4–5 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3–4 June 2021), trade (27–28 May 2021), interior (7–9 September 2021) digital and technology (28–29 April 2021), development (3–5 May 2021) and foreign ministers.

====Friction with the United States====
The 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump&#x27;s position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump&#x27;s economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump&#x27;s behaviour as a &quot;depressing withdrawal&quot;, while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him &quot;to be serious&quot;. In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.

==Member country data==
The G7 is composed of the seven wealthiest advanced countries. The People&#x27;s Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth, but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index. As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth; including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.
The combined population of the G7 countries is about 10% of world population.

==Reception==
According to the group hegemony theory, the G7 has helped stabilise and perpetuate an inequitable world economic order.

===2015 protests===

About 7,500 protesters led by the group &#x27;Stop-G7&#x27; demonstrated during the 2015 summit in Bavaria, Germany. About 300 of those reached the 3 m high and 7 km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.

<text>Longwarry railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Longwarry, in Victoria, Australia. Longwarry station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 1 July 1881.

==History==
The track east of the station to Drouin was duplicated in 1952, but the section between Bunyip and Longwarry remains single track, because the bridge over the Bunyip River has not been duplicated. The line through Longwarry to Warragul was electrified in July 1954, but electrification was removed in December 1998.

On 26 August 1988, the electric staff safeworking system between Longwarry and Bunyip was abolished, and was replaced with automatic three-position signalling. The double line block system between Longwarry and Warragul was also abolished, along with the signal box and all two position signals. At the same time, boom barriers were provided at the Yannathan Road level crossing, replacing hand-operated gates. By October 1989, the connections to the former goods siding was abolished, as was the overhead wire above the siding.

As part of the Regional Rail Revival project, a second platform will be built at the station, and the line between Bunyip and Longwarry was scheduled to be duplicated, with the project to be completed in late 2022. However, it was reported in May 2022, that the duplication of the Bunyip-Longwarry track would not go ahead.

==Platforms and services==
Longwarry has two platforms. The second of which commenced operations in 2024. It is served by V/Line Traralgon and selected Bairnsdale line trains.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross in the morning and early afternoon
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale in the late afternoon and evening

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale in the morning and early afternoon
* services to Southern Cross in the late afternoon and evening

==Transport links==
Warragul Bus Lines operates one route via Longwarry station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
*Garfield station – Traralgon Plaza

<text>The Progressive Labor Party (PLP) is an anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist communist party in the United States. It was established in January 1962 as the Progressive Labor Movement following a split in the Communist Party USA, adopting its new name at a convention held in the spring of 1965. It was involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement of the 1960s and early 1970s through its Worker Student Alliance faction of Students for a Democratic Society.

The PLP publishes a fortnightly newspaper, &quot;Challenge&quot;.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===

The PLP began as an organized faction called the Progressive Labor Movement in January 1962. It was formed in the aftermath of a fall 1961 split in the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) that saw the expulsion of left-wing labor activists Milt Rosen (1926–2011) and Mortimer Scheer. Before his expulsion, Rosen was a prominent CPUSA functionary, serving as District Organizer for upstate New York from 1957 and Industrial Organizer for all of New York state from 1959. An initial organizational meeting was held in December 1961, attended by 12 of the approximately 50 current and former CPUSA members identifying themselves as the &quot;Call group&quot;. Rosen delivered a political report to the Cuban Revolution-inspired group urging the establishment of a new communist party in the United States to replace the CPUSA, which was characterized as irredeemably &quot;revisionist&quot;.

The organization remained amorphous in its first months, publishing &quot;Progressive Labor&quot;—initially a monthly newsletter—and engaging in small-scale discussions. An organizational conference was called by the editors of &quot;Progressive Labor&quot; to be held in New York City in July 1962. This gathering, held at the Hotel Diplomat, was attended by 50 people from 11 different cities and served to launch a formal organization, the Progressive Labor Movement. Rosen again delivered the main political report to the gathering, calling for the writing of a program and development of a network of clubs and affiliated mass organizations in order to win supporters for a new revolutionary socialist movement. Given the small size of the fledgling organization, formation of a political party was deemed unpropitious. The name &quot;Progressive Labor Movement&quot; was selected to emphasize the organization&#x27;s early and transitional nature. The Progressive Labor Movement was finally reconstituted as the Progressive Labor Party at a founding convention held in New York City on April 15–18, 1965. A 20-member National Committee was elected, and Rosen became the party&#x27;s founding chair. Organizational headquarters were established in New York City.

=== 1960s ===

Although it disdains parliamentarism as an end, the Progressive Labor Movement was quick to make use of the electoral process as a vehicle for propaganda, launching an effort to gain the signatures of 5,000 registered voters in New York City to put a PLP candidate on the ballot for the November 1963 election of the New York City Council. Although it did not manage to place its candidate on the ballot, the proto-PLP distributed more than 100,000 pieces of party literature in conjunction with the electoral campaign.

The PLP remained of modest size throughout the decade. It did not publicize its membership, but federal income tax returns filed in 1967 and 1968 provide a reasonable proxy. The PLP formally existed as a publishing partnership listing Milt Rosen and the party&#x27;s 1965 candidate for New York State Senate, Bill Epton, as partners. These returns showed income and expenditures of about $66,000 in 1967 and about $88,600 in 1968, with the partners claiming no income from the ostensible business relationship.

During the 1960s, the PLP followed the international political line of the Chinese Communist Party and was described by commentators as &quot;Maoist&quot;. The organization carved out a niche in the anti-Vietnam War movement, with its Worker Student Alliance faction acting as rivals to the Revolutionary Youth Movement faction within Students for a Democratic Society, a part of which (RYM 1) later evolved into the Weather Underground.

The PLP made extensive use of mass organizations (front groups) from its earliest years, through which it spread its ideas, raised funds and recruited new members. Among these were the Student Committee for Travel to Cuba (1963–64), which organized travel to post-revolutionary Cuba; the Harlem Defense Council (1964), organized in response to racially oriented rioting in Harlem; the May 2nd Movement (M2M, established 1964), organized in opposition to the Vietnam War; and other short-lived, issue-driven front groups.

=== 1970s ===
The PLP ended its previous political line supporting the Cultural Revolution and broke with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the spring of 1971 with the publication of an internal discussion bulletin for party members detailing eight points of disagreement with the Chinese regime. These related to the softening of China&#x27;s foreign relations towards Cambodia, North Korea, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the United States, its &quot;complete elevation of the Black Panther Party as the revolutionary group in the United States&quot; and its &quot;total collusion with every nationalist fake the world over, from Nasser to Nkrumah&quot;.

During the 1970s, the PLP began to shape its activity around racism in the United States, forming a mass organization called the Committee Against Racism (CAR). A CAR convention held in New York City in July 1976 drew 500 participants. The organization made use of aggressive direct action tactics against its perceived opponents, disrupting presentations by the controversial psychologist Arthur Jensen and the physicist William Shockley in the spring of 1976. The CAR were the most vocal of the hostile critics of the sociobiologist E. O. Wilson. The organization picketed in Harvard Square and handed out flyers calling for demonstrations against sociobiology, which in their view was being used to defend individuals and groups responsible for racism, war, and genocide. In 1977, the organization, now renamed the International Committee Against Racism (InCAR), made headlines by disrupting an academic conference by pouring a pitcher of water on Wilson&#x27;s head while chanting &quot;Wilson, you&#x27;re all wet&quot;.

=== Structure ===

According to the constitution adopted at the time of the PLP&#x27;s formation in 1965, membership was open to anyone at least 17 years old who accepted the program and policies of the party, paid dues and required assessments and subscribed to party publications. Supreme authority within the organization was to be exerted by national conventions, held every two years. The convention was to elect a National Committee to handle matters of governance between conventions. The PLP&#x27;s primary party unit was the &quot;club&quot;, organized either on a shop, territorial, or functional basis. All party members were required to be active members of a club and bound by the principles of democratic centralism, in which decisions of higher bodies were considered binding on participants in lower bodies. During the 1960s, new members were additionally required to undergo three months of ideological training, usually in small group settings in individual houses.

Owing in part to the significant economic and extensive time requirements expected of its members, the PLP has since its inception been a small cadre organization, with an &quot;estimated hard-core membership&quot; of about 350 in 1970, supplemented by numerous sympathizers. Members during the 1960s were predominantly from white, middle-class backgrounds, shunned drug use, and tended &quot;to dress neatly and wear short hair&quot;, according to a 1971 House Internal Security Committee staff report.

=== Publications ===
During the 1960s and 1970s, the PLP published a magazine called &quot;Progressive Labor,&quot; which first appeared as a monthly before shifting to quarterly and later bimonthly publication. The press run of &quot;Progressive Labor&quot; circa 1970 was approximately 10,000. The party also published &quot;Challenge,&quot; a publication likewise issued at changing intervals over the years. In 1970, the press run of this publication was approximately 75,000, according to the estimates of government investigators, with many of these copies unsold.

&quot;Challenge&quot; remains in production today as a biweekly, issued under the same covers with its parallel Spanish language counterpart &quot;Desafío.&quot; The PLP also produces a semiannual theoretical magazine, &quot;The Communist.&quot;

During 1963 and 1964, the PLP also produced a theoretical magazine called &quot;Marxist-Leninist Quarterly.&quot; This publication was terminated and merged with &quot;Progressive Labor&quot; magazine in 1965. A West Coast publication called &quot;Spark&quot; was also produced from 1965 until early 1968.

<text>Drouin railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Drouin, in Victoria, Australia. Drouin station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 1 March 1878.

==History==

Drouin opened on 1 March 1878, when the line was extended from Bunyip to Moe. The station, like the township itself, was supposedly named after a Frenchman invented a chlorination process for the extraction of gold and metals from ore, or an Aboriginal word meaning &#x27;north wind&#x27;.

In 1950, the line to Warragul was duplicated, and in 1952, duplication of the line to Longwarry occurred. The present island platform was provided in 1958.

The signal box at Drouin closed in February 1988, with the block post abolished, all fixed signals covered and lights extinguished. The interlocked signal frame was also abolished. By October 1989, all former sidings and crossovers, and the associated overhead wire, were abolished, effectively leaving Drouin as a &quot;through&quot; station.

In 2006, the station building underwent a refurbishment. During this time, it received Viclink purple station signage, the first station on the regional rail network to receive this signage.

==Platforms and services==

Drouin has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by V/Line Traralgon and Bairnsdale line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross in the morning and early afternoon
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale in the late afternoon and evening

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale in the morning and early afternoon
* services to Southern Cross in the late afternoon and evening

==Transport links==

Warragul Bus Lines operates four routes via Drouin station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : to Warragul station
* : to Drouin North
* Garfield station – Traralgon Plaza
* Traralgon station – Drouin North

<text>The Community Chest of Hong Kong () is an independent, nonprofit organization established on 8 November 1968 in Hong Kong. The Community Chest serves as an umbrella organization to provide grants to a wide range of community projects.

==Vision==
The goal of The Community Chest is to work for the betterment of Hong Kong through the support by millions and to build a caring society through greater participation and giving by the Hong Kong community.

==Mission==
The mission statements of the Community Chest are:
* to obtain donations through community wide appeals on behalf of member social welfare agencies;
* to act as trustee of the donors and allocate funds raised prudently to member agencies to strengthen and maximize their services to the needy;
* to provide an integrated service for donors wishing to support a wide range of welfare services in Hong Kong.

==Administration==
The Community Chest is governed by a Board. Under the Board, there are four main committees: the Executive Committee, the Campaign Committee, the Public Relations Committee and the Admissions, Budgets and Allocations Committee. Over 300 volunteers serving on various sub-committees contribute to support the work of these committees. They also work with the 40 staff at the Chest office to accomplish their fundraising target each year and allocate these funds to over 140 social welfare agencies.

Each year, more than 1.7 million needy people benefit from the fundraising programs organized by the Chest. The Chest&#x27;s administrative costs are subsidized by an annual grant from The Hong Kong Jockey Club, and by returns on investments. Therefore, the Chest is able to allocate 100% of the donations it receives to the beneficiaries without any deduction for administrative expenses.

==Member agencies==
There are over 168 member agencies of the Chest in 2023. They are:

(Agency names are listed in alphabetical order)

==Services supported (baseline allocations)==

For family welfare services, there are 5 components: family support services, services for families with special needs, services for family reunion and new arrivals, services for women/men as well as parent education.

===Rehabilitation and aftercare services===
Eight groups of people are provided with aftercare and rehabilitation services from the Community Chest of Hong Kong. They are the visually impaired, the hearing impaired, the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped, people who are chronically ill, drug-abusers, ex-offenders and people with other disabilities.

===Children and youth services===
In services provided to children and youth, provision of after school care services is one of the major parts. Also, youth counselling and recreational services are provided in youth centres. While collaborating with organisations like The Hong Kong Award for Young People and The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, developmental and supportive services are provided. Furthermore, training is provided for the youth with collaborations of Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps and Boys&#x27; Brigade, Hong Kong, etc. Play-related services are also provided.

===Community development and other services===

==Major events==
===Dress Special Day===
&quot;Dress Special Day&quot; (公益服飾日, formerly named &quot;Dress Casual Day&quot; 公益金便服日), first launched in 1993, is a day when participants can dress in their favourite wear to work or to school and at the same time to raise funds for charity. It has run become a popular fund-raising event with an increasing number of participants every year. Each participant who raises/donates HK$60 can join the event while no minimum is set for student participants.

As more and more employers began to encourage their employees to go to work in their casual wear, &quot;Dress Casual Day&quot; was renamed &quot;Dress Special Day&quot; in 2006. In doing so, the theme of this activity can be more flexible and vivid. It is hoped that donation can reach a higher peak by drawing strength from more participants.

<doc id="1196672" wikidata="Q7969923" url="?curid=1196672" title="Warragul railway station">
<text>Warragul railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Warragul, in Victoria, Australia. Warragul station is a ground level premium station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 1 March 1878, with the current station provided in 2015.

Initially opened as Warrigal, the station was given its current name of Warragul on 1 May 1879.

==History==

The line between Pakenham and Warragul was duplicated in various stages between 1952 and 1956, and was electrified in 1954. Two years earlier, in 1952, the line to Yarragon was duplicated, and in 1955, electrification was extended to Moe.

It was the junction station for the branch line to Neerim South and Noojee, which closed in 1958.

Starting from 15 February 1987, and lasting until December 1998, the station was the terminus of a number of The Met/PTC electric passenger services from Flinders Street. The line was de-electrified beyond Warragul on 28 June 1987, and the overhead support structures were removed in 2005/2006, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project.

The former &quot;A&quot; siding was abolished in 1988, along with alterations to the points, signals and levers. Also during 1988, the double line block system between Warragul and Yarragon was abolished, with automatic three position signalling introduced. This introduction also resulted in the abolition of signal boxes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, both replaced by a signal panel in the station building.

The tracks in the former yard are now used as storage for concrete sleepers, old and new signals, and rail machines. Tracks on the northern side of the station were moved slightly, to reduce the radius of curves, and allow trains to travel at higher speed.

On 28 April 2006, the signal panel within the station building was abolished.

The station itself was upgraded in 2015. It included a new car park and a bus interchange, a new footbridge next to the Alfred Street overpass and a new road underpass at Normanby Place, located at the eastern end of the station.

==Platforms and services==

Warragul has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by V/Line Traralgon and Bairnsdale line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Southern Cross in the morning and early afternoon
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale in the late afternoon and evening

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale in the morning and early afternoon
