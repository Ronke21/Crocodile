<text>Hult Ashridge Executive Education (also known as the Hult Ashridge) is the executive education arm of Hult International Business School, based in London, Dubai, and Hult&#x27;s flagship executive education campus on the Ashridge Estate.

Formerly an independent business school, known as &quot;Ashridge Business School&quot;, Ashridge completed an operational merger with Hult in 2015. It offers teaching leadership and organisational development.

==History==
The college was conceived at Ashridge House in 1921, when the house was acquired by a trust established by Bonar Law, a future UK Prime Minister; in 1929 it became a &quot;College of Citizenship&quot;, established to help the Conservative Party develop its intellectual forces in struggles with left-wing organisations such as the Fabian Society. It became a cross between a think-tank and a training centre and had Arthur Bryant as its educational adviser.

After the Second World War, the &quot;College of Citizenship&quot; was briefly re-established but in 1959 it was re-launched with a new focus on management training, taking the name Ashridge Management College.

In 2015 the then Ashridge Business School operationally merged with Hult International Business School, an international business school with campuses in seven cities around the world. As part of the merger, &quot;Ashridge Business School&quot; changed its name to Ashridge Executive Education.

==Organization and administration==
===Constitution===
Ashridge Business School is constituted as a registered charity, formally named the Ashridge (Bonar Law Memorial) Trust, and is one of the 150 largest UK charitable organisations ranked by annual expenditure. The trust has the following goals: (a) honouring the memory of a great statesman, (b) the preservation of the house and grounds as an historic building, (c) to create an educational centre (d) to train lecturers, speakers and writers to further the study of the subjects outlined above (e) provide lectures and/or discussions on these subjects open to the public or for those who had paid fees to attend, (f) provide a supporting staff, (g) to allow boarding by those attending the lectures and discussions.

===Faculty===
Ashridge employs approximately 95 full-time academic staff and has a further 100 associate faculty members. Faculty members are not traditional academics – the majority combine significant academic qualifications with extensive international business experience, enabling them to become fully involved with the issues and challenges faced by clients and individual participants. Academic staff regularly serve on the councils of international educational and advisory bodies, including the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) and Association of MBAs (AMBA). They also share their expertise as visiting professors at many international business schools and universities.

<text>Longyan (; Hakka: &quot;Liùng-ngàm&quot;; Longyan dialect: &quot;Liông-nâ [liɔŋ˩nã˩]&quot;) is a prefecture-level city in south-western Fujian Province, China, bordering Guangdong to the south and Jiangxi to the west.

==History==
In 736 AD (during the Tang dynasty), the prefecture of Tingzhou was established in western Fujian, or &quot;Minxi&quot; (), administering Changting, Huanglian and Xinluo counties. Six years later Xinluo was named Longyan for the nearby cavern, a famous scenic site.

Due to the ancient conflicts in central China and aggression from northern tribes, many Han people moved from central China to Longyan.

in 1734, the Hokkien-speaking counties of Longyan city and Zhangping were ceded from Zhangzhou to form the Longyan Prefecture within the Hakka peasant Tingzhou prefecture, a typical Hakka peasant society culturally distinct from the Minnanese by the imperial court. In 1913, it reverted to its former name Longyan County and in 1981, Longyan City was established.

Minxi was a strategic base during the Chinese Civil War.

It is said that tens of thousands of people were recruited from the Hakka peasantry from the western Longyan to join the PLA during the Chinese Civil War, and nearly every Hakka family had someone sacrificed lives on behalf of CCP side especially during Mao&#x27;s early purges in Tingzhou and Ganzhou which killed roughly 700,0000 Hakka people and some ethnic minorities. There are more than 26,000 locals that took part in the Long March which in total was carried out by 86,000. Moreover, during 1955 and 1968, 68 people from Longyan were awarded Brigadier General or above, which accounts for 82% of all generals from Fujian province at the time, therefore, Longyan is also named as &quot;The Home of Generals&quot;.

==Environment==
Unlike many Chinese cities, the forest coverage of Longyan reaches an unusually high 77.9%, which is unparalleled in Fujian province. Meihuashan National Nature Reserve, a part of the China Biosphere Reserve Network, is located in Longyan.

Goby &quot;Rhinogobius longyanensis&quot; was first described from Longyan and named after it. Presumably also the prehistoric bivalve &quot;Claraia longyanensis&quot; got its name from Longyan.

==Geography and climate==
Longyan is situated in the upper reaches of the Jiulong and Ting Rivers. It borders the prefecture-level cities of Sanming to the north, Quanzhou to the east, Zhangzhou to the southeast, Meizhou (Guangdong) to the southwest, and Ganzhou (Jiangxi) to the west and northwest.

Longyan has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with short, mild winters, and long, hot and humid summers. Despite its inland location, the city&#x27;s summers rank among the mildest in the province, averaging lower than even Xiamen and the islands of Pingtan County, both of which receive significant maritime moderation. Rainfall is greatest in spring and early summer and at its least in autumn and early winter.

==Demographics==
The prefecture-level city of Longyan had a population of 2,559,545 inhabitants as of 2010, according to the 2010 National Census. The population of Longyan in 2010 was 4.65% inferior than in 2000 (when the inhabitants of the city stand at 2,684,310), giving an average annual rate of growth of -0.47%.

==Administration==
The municipal executive, legislature, and judiciary are in Xinluo District (), together with the CPC and Public Security Bureau. The information about population uses the 2010 Census data.

==Culture==
Longyan is inhabited by Hoklo people and Hakka peasants. The Hoklo people live in the urban areas and cities of Xinluo and Zhangping districts in the eastern Longyan prefecture and speak Longyan Min while Hakka peasants live in rural village areas of the countryside of the western part of the prefecture, making western Longyan famous for being named as the &quot;Home of Hakka People&quot;. The rural county of Changting is often referred to as the home of the Hakka, while the Ting River is known as the &quot;mother river&quot; of the Hakka people.

Longyan is a recent artificial construct of the Chinese government, having never been united together before the creation of Modern China. The two culturally distinct and separate Hoklo eastern city areas and Hakka western rural peasant areas have almost nothing in common in terms of language, culture and living habits, and were only forcibly merged into a single administrative region recently in history by the communist government.

==Economy==
Longyan serves as a strategic center for the distribution of goods to Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. It also acts as a gateway for trade with Guangdong and Jiangxi province. It is the main connection between the inland and coastal area.

Longyan is rich in natural resources such as important mineral deposits and forest zones. The Septwolves tobacco business is an important contributor to the local economy, as is the Zijin Mining group. The largest construction equipment maker Lonking Holdings is based in the city.

<text>Vector control is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds, insects or other arthropods (here collectively called &quot;vectors&quot;) which transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is mosquito control using a variety of strategies. Several of the &quot;neglected tropical diseases&quot; are spread by such vectors.

== Importance ==
For diseases where there is no effective cure, such as Zika virus, West Nile fever and Dengue fever, vector control remains the only way to protect human populations.

However, even for vector-borne diseases with effective treatments the high cost of treatment remains a huge barrier to large amounts of developing world populations. Despite being treatable, malaria has by far the greatest impact on human health from vectors. In Africa, a child dies every minute of malaria; this is a reduction of more than 50% since 2000 due to vector control. In countries where malaria is well established the World Health Organization estimates countries lose 1.3% annual economic income due to the disease. Both prevention through vector control and treatment are needed to protect populations.

As the impacts of disease and virus are devastating, the need to control the vectors in which they carried is prioritized. Vector control in many developing countries can have tremendous impacts as it reduces mortality rates, especially among infants. Because of the high movement of the population, disease spread is also a greater issue in these areas.

As many vector control methods are effective against multiple diseases, they can be integrated together to combat multiple diseases at once. The World Health Organization therefore recommends &quot;Integrated Vector Management&quot; as the process for developing and implementing strategies for vector control.

== Methods ==
Vector control focuses on utilizing preventive methods to control or eliminate vector populations. Common preventive measures are:

===Habitat and environmental control===
Removing or reducing areas where vectors can easily breed can help limit their growth. For example, stagnant water removal, destruction of old tires and cans which serve as mosquito breeding environments, and good management of used water can reduce areas of excessive vector incidence.

Further examples of environmental control is by reducing the prevalence of open defecation or improving the designs and maintenance of pit latrines. This can reduce the incidence of flies acting as vectors to spread diseases via their contact with feces of infected people.

===Reducing contact===
Limiting exposure to insects or animals that are known disease vectors can reduce infection risks significantly. For example, bed nets, window screens on homes, or protective clothing can help reduce the likelihood of contact with vectors. To be effective this requires education and promotion of methods among the population to raise the awareness of vector threats.

===Chemical control===
Insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, Lethal ovitraps and repellents can be used to control vectors. For example, larvicides can be used in mosquito breeding zones; insecticides can be applied to house walls or bed nets, and use of personal repellents can reduce incidence of insect bites and thus infection. The use of pesticides for vector control is promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has proven to be highly effective.

===Biological control===
The use of natural vector predators, such as bacterial toxins or botanical compounds, can help control vector populations. Using fish that eat mosquito larvae, the use of Catfish to eat up mosquito larvae in ponds can eradicate the mosquito population, or reducing breeding rates by introducing sterilized male tsetse flies have been shown to control vector populations and reduce infection risks.

== Legislation ==

=== United States ===
In the United States, cities or special districts are responsible for vector control. For example, in California, the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District is a special district set up by the state to oversee vector control in multiple cities.

<doc id="1205021" wikidata="Q912936" url="?curid=1205021" title="Castaway (film)">
<text>Castaway is a 1986 British biographical-drama film directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring Amanda Donohoe and Oliver Reed. The screenplay was by Allan Scott, adapted from the eponymous 1984 book by Lucy Irvine, telling of her experiences of staying for a year with writer Gerald Kingsland on the isolated island of Tuin, between New Guinea and Australia.

== Real life inspiration ==
In 1981, Lucy Irvine responded to an advertisement placed by writer Gerald Kingsland, and they became self-imposed castaways for a year on the isolated and uninhabited island of Tuin, in the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia. Chosen by Kingsland from over 50 applicants, Irvine agreed to marry him to satisfy immigration restrictions before they travelled to Tuin. She was 25 years old, and he was 49. After a year, they returned home, and in 1983, she published her account of the experience in &quot;Castaway&quot;, which was later used as the basis for the film.

When Irvine met director Nicolas Roeg, he felt her story was perfect material for telling a relationship between an older man and a younger woman. It never was intended to be exactly like her experience, as Roeg felt Irvine would be too personally involved then. Irvine was positive about the film, stating she was pleased with Donohoe, Reed and Roeg.

== Cast ==
In 2011, Donohoe recalled her experience working with Reed, stating: &#x27;Well, naked on a desert island with Oliver Reed – it was a tabloid fantasy, wasn&#x27;t it? He was an alcoholic and his behaviour was erratic, but he was always a courteous and good actor. His personal life wasn&#x27;t working but he never crossed any lines professionally.&#x27;

== Soundtrack ==
The film opens with a song by English artist Kate Bush, &quot;Be Kind to My Mistakes&quot;. A slightly edited version later appeared on the 1997 re-release of her album &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;. The soundtrack begins with a different version of the same song, which was also released as a 7-inch single. The rest of the soundtrack album is instrumental and composed by Stanley Myers. It received a limited CD release in 2013.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
The film grossed £440,281 in the United Kingdom. Including its gross from the United States, the film grossed over $1 million.

===Critical response===
The movie received a mixed reception from critics.

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Extended absurdity uncharacteristic of its director.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: &quot;Both Amanda Donohoe and Oliver Reed cope well with their roles as the castaway and the sex-mad, middle-aged man who is her companion, but in the end you can&#x27;t help feeling the nudity is only there to spice up a tale of two selfish people who probably deserved each other.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Newcomer Amanda Donohoe spends most of the pic displaying the absence of bikini marks on her body (palm trees always seem to obscure the vital parts of Oliver Reed as Gerald Kingsland), and she copes well with a character whose motives and methods for going to the tiny desert island remain dubious. Reed gives the performance of his career as a sexually frustrated middle-aged man in search of sun and sex, and is admirably complemented by Amanda Donohoe as the determined but fickle object of his lust. Photography is excellent (especially underwater scenes) but though Castaway is a great ad for the tropical Seychelles, it won’t be remembered as a Nicolas Roeg classic.&quot;

<doc id="1205022" wikidata="Q489946" url="?curid=1205022" title="Hyeongsan River">
<text>The Hyeongsan River is a river in southeastern South Korea. It flows from Baeyanggol Valley (), Wolpyeong-ri (월평리/), Dudong-myeon (두동면/), Ulju County in Ulsan to the Sea of Japan, covering a distance of about 62 km. The Hyeongsan watershed covers roughly 1,167 km2 (Jo 1987:35).

The Hyeongsan flows north from near the northern border of Greater Ulsan into Gyeongju, where it enters the Gyeongju Basin and is joined by the Bukcheon stream (북천/), a major tributary. It continues north into Pohang, and in Angang-eup of Pohang it is joined by the Gigyecheon flowing from the north and turns abruptly eastward. From there runs east and slightly north until it meets the Sea of Japan at Pohang Harbor. The estuary of the Hyeongsan has been covered by the massive industrial development around the port of Pohang, including the POSCO steel mill.

==History==
The Hyeongsan is primarily notable for the Silla civilization which arose within its valley, centered at Gyeongju.

Middle Jeulmun Pottery Period potsherds have been unearthed in the Hyeongsan Basin. Several significant Mumun settlements arose along the river after 1100 BC, notably Wolsan-ri and Hwangseong-dong (FPCP 2005; GNRICH 2003).

==Economy==
Today the Hyeongsan continues to play a role in local transport, as it has for thousands of years. Although very little boat traffic is found on the river, the river valley still provides an important transportation corridor. Highways connecting Ulsan, Gyeongju and Pohang follow the river&#x27;s course, as does the Donghae Nambu Line passenger railway from Gyeongju to Pohang.

The sprawling industrial facilities of Pohang Iron and Steel (POSCO) and INI Steel are located in Pohang just south of the mouth of the Hyeongsan. The eastern bank of the river in the suburbs north of the old city of Gyeongju are the home to many industrial facilities.

<text>Rush ( ), officially An Ros, is a small seaside commuter town in Fingal, County Dublin, Ireland. Rush lies on the Irish Sea coast, between Skerries and Lusk, and has a small harbour. It had a population at the 2022 census of 10,875.

Rush was once known as the &quot;market garden of Ireland&quot; for the large role market gardening played in its economy and culture. In the 21st century, Rush is no longer a major centre of national horticulture and has instead evolved into a growing commuter town on the northern fringes of the Greater Dublin Area.

==Geography==
Rush lies on the Irish Sea coast, on the angle where the R128 regional road turns from running east–west from Lusk to go north–south to Skerries. It has a small harbour.

Rush is in a slightly hilly coastal area. Four streams come to the sea in the vicinity, St. Catherine&#x27;s Stream, Kenure Stream, the Rush Town Stream, and a combined flow at the western edge of the town; some occasionally cause flooding. The middle two cross Rush&#x27;s North Strand beach.

Rush is also a townland in the civil parish of Lusk in the barony of Balrothery East.

== History and historic features ==
There is evidence of settlement in the Rush area dating back to Neolithic times. Flint tools have been found in the area and there is a passage grave and cist located off the Skerries Road on the headland to the north of North Beach.

In medieval times Rush was a manor of the Earl of Ormond.

In 1744 a description of Rush by a traveller runs as follows:
This town is near an English mile in length [and] lies upon a sandy bank. Most of the houses are built of mud and covered with straw and exceedingly well peopled. By a modest computation &#x27;tis said there is between 300/400 souls. The men are all employed by the fishing and smuggling trade...the quay lies eastward below the town, which is in [the] form of an L. The entrance is very dangerous from S.E. and by E. between two ledges of rocks on the port and larboard side.

In November 1920, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) officer, Lieutenant John (or &#x27;Jack&#x27;) &#x27;Rover&#x27; McCann, was shot by the Black and Tans after being taken from a house in Rush. The next morning, his body was found in a field 100 yards away. Today he is commemorated by a roadside monument on Quay Road. On 29 April 1920 the Naul Battalion of the IRA attacked the Rush RIC Barracks which resulted in the death of a policeman.

=== Drumanagh ===
A large promontory fort is located on the headland of Drumanagh, near Rush. It is surrounded on three sides by cliffs and a large rampart encloses the fourth side.

An article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in January 1996 claimed that Roman coins, brooches and copper ingots were found at the site and that there was &quot;clear evidence...of a Roman coastal fort of up to 40 acres...a significant Roman beachhead, built to support military campaigns in the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D.&quot;. This claim is disputed by many archaeologists who see this simply as evidence of trade between Ireland and the Romans. The artefacts were illegally excavated after being discovered with metal detectors, so they were not available for further study.

The land was acquired by Fingal County Council in 2016 and is of significant interest following the recovery of Romano-British artefacts, rarely found in Ireland. It has been characterised as the place where Roman traders may have landed.

A range of finds was made in the course of a &quot;community archaeology&quot; dig along two trenches by the Martello Tower at the Iron Age site. Fingal Community Archaeologist and excavation director, Christine Baker, said: “Growing up down the road and having been a scholar under the late Iron Age scholar, Prof Barry Raftery, I always dreamed of digging Drumanagh. Artefacts such as a belt brace of the Royal Downshire militia and Royal Artillery brass buttons were found alongside fragments of wine glasses, clay pipes and a range of pottery and food particles, adding to the story of the Martello.”

Evidence of earlier activity was also recovered during the dig including shards of pottery which have their origins in the Roman era, and two decorated Iron Age combs. Also found were two fragments of human bone which have been identified as part of a female skull dating back to BC170-AD52, as identified by osteologist Dr Linda Lynch and radiocarbon dated by Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

A conservation plan for the Drumanagh fort has been developed by Fingal County Council. Following a process of public consultation, the Drumanagh Conservation Study &amp; Heritage Plan 2018-2023 contains accessible historical, archaeological, folkloric, and cartographic evidence.

It also sets out policies and objectives for the future protection and management of the site.

=== Saint Maur&#x27;s church ===
The ruins of the original St. Maur&#x27;s chapel lie in Whitestown cemetery, about a mile west of the centre of Rush. These date back to Anglo-Norman times and are named after Saint Maurus, a follower of St. Benedict. There is a legend connected with these ruins that some French navigators, who may have been crusaders, got caught in a storm. They made a vow to St. Maur that if they survived they would build a chapel in his honour on the first point of land they reached. They subsequently landed at Rogerstown and built a chapel there in his honour. The area became known as Knightstown and later Whitestown.

In 1776, a church was built closer to the centre of Rush to replace the old chapel. It was also dedicated to St. Maur and is one of the earliest examples of a penal Catholic church in the Fingal area. It now houses Rush library.

The current Catholic church of Saint Maur is beside the 1776 building. It was dedicated in 1989 and is in the new, post-Vatican II style.

=== Kenure House ===
Two miles north from the centre of Rush village lies a magnificent portico which is all that remains of Kenure House, a large mansion which had many acres of an estate around it. The name is an anglicised version of &quot;Ceann Iubhair&quot;, meaning &quot;headland of the yew trees&quot;. There is a nearby ruined church which was dedicated to St. Damnan and also nearby are the ruins of a small Norman keep.

Kenure formed part of the ancient manor of Rush, which was vested in the Earls and Dukes of Ormonde in 1666. They held on to their lands in Rush until 1714 when the Echlins took over. They remained there until 1780. Elizabeth Echlin married Francis Palmer of Castlelacken Co Mayo. Colonel R H Fenwick-Palmer, the last of the line, sold the estate to the Irish Land Commission in 1964. The portico of Kenure House was added to the house in and about 1840, by George Papworth, an English architect who practised in Ireland during the 19th century. Many films were made on location at the great house. These include &quot;The Face of Fu Manchu&quot; (1965), &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (1965 film which features the great house extensively as the main setting for the story, with some fleeting glimpses of the outside portico) and &quot;Jules Verne&#x27;s Rocket to the Moon&quot; (aka Rocket to the Moon) (1967). The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1978, when the housing estate Saint Catherines was built on part of the former estate. A number of Rush people did protest at the time, and managed to prevent at least the portico from being destroyed.

=== Smuggling ===
Rush was notorious for smuggling in the 18th century after the British imposed excise duties on a large number of goods. It was home to the famed smuggler, Jack Connor (aka &quot;Jack the Batchelor&quot; and also &quot;Jack Field&quot;) and was the birthplace of the pirate Luke Ryan on 14 February 1750. Ryan is said to have been a privateer for the French government during the American Revolutionary War. He was reportedly arrested and tried as a pirate at the Old Bailey. He was arrested on 25 February 1789 and supposedly died in prison on 18 June 1789 aged 39 due to septicaemia during his imprisonment for failing to pay a debt of £200.

Jack Connor was a popular Robin hood type figure who is mentioned in an old ballad:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
&quot;The lover may sigh&quot;
&quot;The courtier may lie&quot;
&quot;And Croesus his treasure amass,&quot;
&quot;All these joys are but vain&quot;
&quot;They are blended with pain&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;ll stand behind Field and my glass&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Jack operated out of the &quot;Smugglers Cave&quot; between Loughshinny and Skerries. He died in 1772 and was buried in Kenure cemetery, on the outskirts of Rush. His namesake is used for Jack the Bachelors, a steakhouse and bar on Main Street.

Luke Ryan was born in Rush in 1750. He emigrated to France when he was young and became a Lieutenant in Dillon&#x27;s Irish Regiment. He later became a smuggler after returning to Rush. He was commissioned by Benjamin Franklin to run a privateer, &quot;The Black prince&quot;, to plunder English ships. He accumulated great wealth from his smuggling, but it was taken from him by the French. He eventually died in a debtors&#x27; prison in 1789 owing a debt of 200 pounds.

=== Martello towers ===
Rush is home to 2 of the 29 Martello Towers in the Greater Dublin Area; they are on the headland near the North Beach and at Drumanagh, and were built in 1804 as a defence against Napoleon.

== Amenities ==

Rush has two sandy beaches, called the &quot;North Beach&quot; and &quot;South Beach&quot;, which are separated by the rocky head of the peninsula and a small tidal harbour, Rush Harbour. The peninsula is the closest point of land to the privately owned Lambay Island. The prevailing winds and tides make Rush South Beach an extremely popular kitesurfing location while its sand and dunes attract many visitors. Close to the south shore is 9 hole golf links. In the past, Rush had many caravan sites which were popular for summer holidays. It still has some caravan sites close to its beaches.
Rush sailing club is also located near the south shore and operates from a second harbour, Rogerstown harbour, situated on the Rogerstown Estuary, known locally as &#x27;the pier.&#x27; This harbour is also used by a supply boat, &quot;The Shamrock&quot;, which provides supplies for the inhabitants of Lambay island.

Rush has several pubs and clubs together with a small number of restaurants. The local Millbank Theatre, home to Rush Dramatic Society is respected for its quality plays and dramas. Rush Musical Society is well respected for its annual productions also.

===Education===
Rush has three primary schools, Gaelscoil Ros Eo, Rush National School, and St. Catherines National School.

There is also a secondary school, St.Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School.

== Transport ==
Rush and Lusk railway station, opened on 25 May 1844, is served by Commuter (formerly &quot;Arrow&quot;) suburban trains between Dublin and Drogheda.

Fingal Express is the privately owned, premium coach service from Skerries, Rush and Lusk to Dublin City Centre and UCD. It is a division of Eirebus.

==Sport==
Rush is home to several sports clubs, including Naomh Maur GAA club, Rush Athletic F.C. Rush Sailing Club, Rush Cricket Club, Elite Taekwon-Do Academy, Rush Fight Academy, Rush And Lusk Karate Club and the Benny Murphy darts tournament.

<doc id="1205025" wikidata="Q1016801" url="?curid=1205025" title="Burning Heart Records">
<text>Burning Heart Records is an independent record label formed in 1993 in Fagersta, Sweden, and currently based in Örebro. It has a close affiliation with Californian label Epitaph Records, who own the rights to distribute Burning Heart&#x27;s output in North America. It also started a German office in Berlin in the end of 2003.

<doc id="1205027" wikidata="Q936425" url="?curid=1205027" title="A Very Long Engagement">
<text>A Very Long Engagement () is a 2004 romantic war drama film, co-written and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel and Marion Cotillard. It is a fictional tale about a young woman&#x27;s desperate search for her fiancé who might have been killed during World War I. It was based on the 1991 novel of the same name by Sébastien Japrisot. The film is a co-production between France and the United States. It was released theatrically in France on 27 October 2004 and in the United States on 26 November 2004.

The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography at the 77th Academy Awards. Marion Cotillard earned the César Award for Best Supporting Actress, while Gaspard Ulliel won the César Award for Most Promising Actor.

==Plot==
Five French soldiers are convicted of self-mutilation in order to escape military service during World War I. They are condemned to face near-certain death in no man&#x27;s land between the French and German trench lines. It appears that all of them were killed in a subsequent battle, but Mathilde, the fiancée of one of the soldiers, refuses to give up hope and begins to uncover clues as to what actually took place on the battlefield. She is all the while driven by the constant reminder of what her fiancé had carved into one of the bells of the church near their home, MMM for &quot;Manech aime Mathilde&quot; (Manech loves Mathilde; a pun on the French word &quot;aime&quot;, which is pronounced like the letter &quot;M&quot;. In the English-language version, this is changed to &quot;Manech&#x27;s marrying Mathilde&quot;).

Along the way, she discovers the brutally corrupt system used by the French government to deal with those who tried to escape the front. She also discovers the stories of the other men who were sentenced to no man&#x27;s land as a punishment. She, with the help of a private investigator, Germain Pire, attempts to find out what happened to her fiancé. The story is told both from the point of view of the fiancée in Paris and the French countryside—mostly Brittany—of the 1920s, and through flashbacks to the battlefield.

Eventually, Mathilde finds out her fiancé is alive, but he suffers from amnesia. Seeing Mathilde, Manech seems to be oblivious of her. At this, Mathilde sits on the garden chair silently watching Manech with tears in her eyes and a smile on her lips.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; was filmed in France over an 18-month period, with about 30 French actors, approximately 500 French technicians and more than 2,000 French extras. Right before the film&#x27;s New York City and Hollywood debut, the film&#x27;s production company, 2003 Productions, which is one-third owned by Warner Bros. and two-thirds owned by Warner France, was ruled an American production company by a French court, denying the studio $4.8 million in government incentives.

The film had a production budget of €45 million (US$58 million), and earned $69.4 million in theaters worldwide.

Joséphine Japy auditioned for the role of a child in the film. She did not get the role but she credits her encounter with Jean-Pierre Jeunet as being decisive in her desire to become an actress. Following the audition, Jeunet came up to Japy and standing at her height, said: &quot;Joséphine, can I talk to you like an adult? Today, it won&#x27;t be you, but one day, we&#x27;ll meet again...&quot;. Japy said that Jeunet&#x27;s words had a real resonance and made her &quot;want to hang on, believe and keep going&quot;, and if Jeunet had not taken the time to say that to her that day, she might not be here [talking to the interviewer].

== Release==
Warner Independent Pictures released the film theatrically in the US, followed by VHS and DVD release on July 12, 2005. It was Warner Independent Pictures&#x27; final VHS release. A Blu-ray region B disc from Warner Home Video was released in France.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, 78% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 148 reviews, and an average rating of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A well-crafted and visually arresting drama with a touch of whimsy&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 39 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised &quot;miracle worker&quot; Jean-Pierre Jeunet and called the film &quot;an emotional powerhouse&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Jeunet brings everything together—his joyously poetic style, the lovable Tautou, a good story worth the telling—into a film that is a series of pleasures stumbling over one another in their haste to delight us.&quot;

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a negative review, stating that &quot;Mr. Jeunet shows no interest in animating the characters in his dollhouse world&quot;.

===Awards===
The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography at the 77th Oscars, losing both to &quot;The Aviator&quot;. It was not selected as the French submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, in favor of &quot;The Chorus&quot;. Marion Cotillard won the César Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance, while Audrey Tautou was nominated for Best Actress.

<doc id="1205029" wikidata="Q488627" url="?curid=1205029" title="Marin Headlands">
<text>The Marin Headlands are a hilly peninsula at the southernmost end of Marin County, California, United States, located just north of San Francisco across the Golden Gate Bridge, which connects the two counties and peninsulas. The entire area is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Headlands are famous for their views of the Bay Area, especially of the Golden Gate Bridge.

==Climate==

The Headlands sometimes create their own clouds when moist, warm Pacific Ocean breezes are pushed into higher, colder air, causing condensation, fog, fog drip and perhaps rain. The hills also get more precipitation than at sea level, for the same reason. However, despite being relatively wet, strong gusty Pacific winds prevent dense forests from forming. The many gaps, ridges, and valleys in the hills increase the wind speed and periodically, during powerful winter storms, these winds can reach hurricane force. In summer, breezes can still be very gusty, when the oceanic air and fog crosses the hills.

The weather from November through February in the Headlands is dominated by periodic rainstorms that blow in from the Pacific, often originating in the Gulf of Alaska, and give the area the majority of its rainfall for the year. These cloudy, gray, and rainy days often are interspersed with cool but extremely clear ones. As winter turns to spring, the April-to-June weather tends to be dominated by powerful winds, less rain, and clearer skies. Summer days alternate between clear and warm intervals, giving way to foggy and cool periods. September and October bring the highest average temperatures of the year and the longest stretches of clear skies.

==Hawk Hill==

The centerpoint of the Marin Headlands skyline is the Hawk Hill, the lookout point for the largest known flight of diurnal raptors in the Pacific states.

Each autumn, from August into December, tens of thousands of hawks, kites, falcons, eagles, vultures, osprey, and harriers are funneled by the peninsular shape of Marin County into the headlands. Hawks avoid flight over water since warm thermals that provide lift are rare. Abundant populations of small mammals protected by the park are one resource that helps maintain the large number of visiting raptors in the Headlands during the fall, but the strong onshore winds hitting the hills of the Headlands provide cold updrafts and hot late-summer days provide warm thermals that allow these birds to fly more efficiently.

Volunteers with the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory count and track this fall migration using bird-banding and radio-tracking techniques, all in cooperation with the National Park Service.

==Wildlife==

The Marin Headlands are also home to black tail deer, mountain lions, bobcats, two types of foxes, coyotes, wild turkeys, hares, rabbits, raccoons, and skunks. In 2003, there was a reported sighting of a black bear in the Headlands; the report was lent credence by a 2012 finding of bear scat on a hiking trail in the Kent Lake watershed, and another sighting on the Point Reyes National Seashore in 2011. River otters inhabit the freshwater lagoons and streams. Large numbers of water birds also migrate through the Headlands, including brown pelicans from May through October; and grebes, egrets, and great blue herons in the spring, summer, and fall. The Headlands&#x27; status as a park protects the habitat and populations of these animals within just a few miles of San Francisco and its suburbs.

In the waters surrounding the Headlands, harbor seals can be found year-round, gray whales can be seen in the spring and fall, and seabirds such as common murres and surf scoters swim within sight of shore.

When Richard Henry Dana Jr. visited San Francisco Bay in 1835 he wrote about vast elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;) herds on the Marin Headlands on December 27: &quot;...we came to anchor near the mouth of the bay, under a high and beautifully sloping hill, upon which herds of hundreds and hundreds of red deer [note: &quot;red deer&quot; is the European term for &quot;elk&quot;], and the stag, with his high branching antlers, were bounding about...&quot;

==Geology==

The Marin Headlands are underlain by geological formations created by the accretion of oceanic sediments from the Pacific Plate onto the North American Plate. The process of subduction of ocean floor, followed by tectonic underplating to the underside of the over-riding plate, was first described here by Clyde Wahrhaftig in 1984. The primary rock types of the Marin Headlands include graywacke sandstone, radiolarian chert, serpentinite, pillow basalts, and shale. These rocks began their migration over one hundred million years ago from as far south as present-day Los Angeles. The erosion of the hillsides and construction activities during the military era have exposed some dramatic examples of these rock types for easy viewing, and the folding caused by tectonic action is visually evident in many places throughout the Headlands.
The Marin Headlands are one of the featured field trips found in the Streetcar 2 Subduction online field trip guide series released in December 2019 by the American Geophysical Union.

==Cultural history==
===Native Americans===
The Marin Headlands are home to the Coastal Miwok tribe. Before colonization, western expansion, and gentrification, the Miwok freely moved between the bay side of the peninsula and the ocean side, seasonally, for thousands of years. The growth of the San Francisco Bay Area has negatively impacted Miwok sacred sites, culture, and tribal visibility. Miwok continue to seek federal recognition.

===Ranchos===
In the 18th century, Spanish and Mexican ranchers occupied the Headlands, eventually giving way to Portuguese immigrant dairy farmers (often from the Azores) during the American period following the U.S. acquisition of California in the Mexican–American War.

===Military sites===
The Marin Headlands are the site of a number of historic military settlements and fortifications, including Fort Cronkhite, Fort Barry, a large number of bunkers and batteries, and the SF-88 Nike Missile silo. In the 1890s, the first military installations were built to prevent hostile ships from entering San Francisco Bay. The batteries at Kirby Cove, above Black Sands Beach, south of Rodeo Beach, and at Battery Mendell are examples of fortifications from the pre–World War I period. During World War II, Batteries Wallace, Townsley, and 129 on Hawk Hill were built into the hills to protect them from aerial bombardment and the high-caliber shells that would be fired by Axis battleships. The emplacements at the top of Hawk Hill were used for a radio station. During the Cold War, the gun batteries were decommissioned, but antiaircraft missile sites were built on the northern and southern sides of Rodeo Lagoon. Radar sites were placed atop Hawk Hill and Hill 88. At several locations, shelters were built into the hillsides to protect the military personnel from the use of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.

Observation posts known as base end stations can also be found in the Headlands. A well-preserved example can be seen near the northern end of Rodeo Beach, and others are located near the Point Bonita Lighthouse and on Wolf Ridge as it slopes down to the sea.

All military sites in the Headlands are now decommissioned and returned to civilian use. Some military facilities, such as SF-88, have been preserved as historical sites. Many historical buildings are now used by non-profit organizations, but maintained in their historical condition.

Other historic landmarks in the Headlands include Point Bonita Lighthouse.

===Development===
In the 1960s, the government sold over of land in the Marin Headlands to a private developer who planned to build a city named Marincello. The development was to house 30,000 people in 50 apartment towers, vast tracts of single-family homes, a shopping center, and a hotel along the Headlands&#x27; pristine shoreline and hills. In 1970, the developer lost a lawsuit claiming the land was illegally zoned. The thousands of acres that would have been developed were sold to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, allowing the open space to stay intact as a park.

==Recreation==
===Views===
The area has views of San Francisco and, as such, is a tourist destination. One of the most common photographs of San Francisco is the view of the city from the Headlands with the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge just reaching out of the fog. On clear days, the site offers views of the bay, including the Farallon Islands, Angel Island, Alcatraz, the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge and the East Bay.

Where Conzelman Road runs along the southern shore of the Headlands and becomes one-way, a pedestrian path leads upwards to Hawk Hill. A short distance further on the right, in a grove of Monterey pines, is a bench from which it is possible to view the Golden Gate, ship traffic passing beneath the bridge, and the city just beyond.

===Beaches===

The Headlands offers a number of beaches including Rodeo Beach (a pebble-covered, dark sand beach), Kirby Cove, Pirates&#x27; Cove, Black Sands Beach, Tennessee Beach, Muir Beach. Rodeo and Muir Beaches are accessible by car, while the others require hikes of varying length and difficulty.

===Hiking/biking===
There are many hiking and biking trails in the Headlands, several of which pass through coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and riparian areas.

===Birding===
The raptor migration attracts birdwatchers to Hawk Hill, and waterfowl and seabirds can sometimes be seen on Rodeo Lagoon.

==Facilities and notable places==
The National Park Service maintains a visitor center near the intersection of Field Road and Bunker Road about a mile from Rodeo Beach. The visitor center contains historical and natural history displays as well as a small bookstore/gift shop. Hiking maps and Park Service program information are available as well.

Facilities include Presidio Fire Department Fire Station No. 2, located at building 1045 Fort Cronkhite. This fire station is operated by the National Park Service and houses one fire engine with cliff rescue capabilities.

Public restrooms are available in the Headlands at the visitor center parking lot, the parking lot near Rodeo Beach, and portable toilet facilities are available at the trailhead leading to the Point Bonita Lighthouse, along Conzelman Road near Black Sands Beach, at Battery Alexander dug into the hillside between Rodeo Beach and the Lighthouse, and at Battery 129 on Hawk Hill.

Conference center facilities are located in former military buildings maintained by the Point Bonita YMCA, NatureBridge, and the Headlands Center for the Arts. The Cavallo Point conference center is in East Fort Baker on the eastern side of the peninsula.

Other areas within Marin Headlands include Kirby Cove, Rodeo Lagoon, and Tennessee Cove.

Various nonprofit organizations have facilities in Marin Headlands. These include the Marine Mammal Center, the Foundation for Deep Ecology, and the NatureBridge campus (formerly known as the Headlands Institute), all in Fort Cronkhite; the Headlands Center for the Arts and the Marin Headlands Hostel at Fort Barry; and the Marin Headlands and Tennessee Valley Native Plant Nurseries.

<doc id="1205031" wikidata="Q4956324" url="?curid=1205031" title="Brancepeth, County Durham">
<text>Brancepeth is a village and civil parish in County Durham, in England. It is situated about from Durham on the A690 road between Durham and Weardale. The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 414.

==Name origin==

The name likely derives from &quot;Bran&#x27;s Path&quot;, after St Brandon, the parish church&#x27;s patron saint. According to another story, the village&#x27;s name is said to derive from &quot;Brawn&#x27;s Path&quot;. There is a legend that Brancepeth was once terrorised by an enormous brawn (boar), which was eventually killed by a knight named Sir Roger de Ferie in 1208. A commemorative stone marks the traditional location of the brawn&#x27;s death.

==History==

Brancepeth Castle was until 1570 the fortress of the Neville Earls of Westmorland. The castle was extensively modified and rebuilt in the 19th century by Viscount Boyne (later Baron Brancepeth). It was later a military hospital.

St Brandon&#x27;s Church was famed for its exceptional 17th-century woodwork, until it was destroyed in a major fire in 1998; the church has since been restored and reroofed.

In 1924, Harry Colt laid out a golf course on the deer park which formed part of the estate surrounding the castle. A club house was created from the old coach house and stables and remains in use by Brancepeth Castle Golf Club.
==Notable residents==

* Frederick William Sanderson (1857–1922)

J.L. Thompson and Sons built &quot;Thistlegorm&quot; in Sunderland, County Durham, as yard number 599. She was launched on 9 April 1940 and completed on 24 June. Her registered length was , her beam was and her depth was . Her tonnages were and . The North Eastern Marine Engineering built her engine, which was a three-cylinder triple-expansion engine rated at 365 NHP or 1,850 IHP.

&quot;Thistlegorm&quot; was built for Albyn Line, who registered her at Sunderland. Her UK official number was 163052 and her wireless telegraphy call sign was GLWQ.

The Ministry of War Transport partly funded &quot;Thistlegorm&quot;. She was a defensively equipped merchant ship (DEMS) with a mounted on her stern and a heavy-calibre machine gun for anti-aircraft cover.
The ship completed three successful voyages in her career. The first was to the US to collect steel rails and aircraft parts, the second to Argentina for grain, and the third to the West Indies for rum. Prior to her fourth and final voyage, she had undergone repairs in Glasgow.

==Final voyage==

She left Glasgow on her final voyage on 2 June 1941, destined for Alexandria, Egypt. The ship&#x27;s cargo included: Bedford trucks, Universal Carrier armoured vehicles, Norton 16H and BSA motorcycles, Bren guns, cases of ammunition, and 0.303 rifles as well as radio equipment, Wellington boots, aircraft parts, railway wagons and two LMS Stanier Class 8F steam locomotives. These steam locomotives and their associated coal and water tenders were carried as deck cargo intended for Egyptian National Railways. The rest of the cargo was for the Allied forces in Egypt. At the time &quot;Thistlegorm&quot; sailed from Glasgow in June, this was the Western Desert Force, which in September 1941 became part of the newly formed Eighth Army. The crew of the ship, under Captain William Ellis, were supplemented by nine naval personnel to man the machine gun and the anti-aircraft gun.

Due to German and Italian naval and air force activity in the Mediterranean, &quot;Thistlegorm&quot; sailed as part of a convoy via Cape Town, South Africa, where she bunkered, before heading north up the East coast of Africa and into the Red Sea. On leaving Cape Town, the light cruiser joined the convoy. Due to a collision in the Suez Canal, the convoy could not transit through the canal to reach the port of Alexandria and instead moored at Safe Anchorage F, in September 1941 where she remained at anchor until her sinking on 6 October 1941. HMS &quot;Carlisle&quot; moored in the same anchorage.

There was a large build-up of Allied troops in Egypt during September 1941 and German intelligence (Abwehr) suspected that there was a troop carrier in the area bringing in additional troops. Two Heinkel He 111 aircraft of II &quot;Staffeln&quot;, Kampfgeschwader 26, Luftwaffe, were dispatched from Crete to find and destroy the troop carrier. This search failed but one of the bombers discovered the ships moored in Safe Anchorage F. Targeting the largest ship, they dropped two 2.5 tonne high explosive bombs on &quot;Thistlegorm&quot;, both of which struck hold 4 near the stern of the ship at 0130 on 6 October. The bomb and the explosion of some of the ammunition stored in hold 4 led to the sinking of &quot;Thistlegorm&quot; with the loss of four sailors and five DEMS gunners. The survivors were picked up by HMS &quot;Carlisle&quot;. Captain Ellis was awarded the OBE for his actions following the explosion and a crewman, Angus McLeay, was awarded the George Medal and the Lloyd&#x27;s War Medal for Bravery at Sea for saving another crew member. Most of the cargo remained within the ship, the major exception being the steam locomotives from the deck cargo which were blown off to either side of the wreck.

==Discovery by Cousteau==
In the early 1950s, Jacques Cousteau discovered her by using information from local fishermen. He raised several items from the wreck, including a motorcycle, the captain&#x27;s safe, and the ship&#x27;s bell. The February 1956 edition of &quot;National Geographic&quot; clearly shows the ship&#x27;s bell in place and Cousteau&#x27;s divers in the ship&#x27;s lantern room. Cousteau documented diving on the wreck in part of his book &quot;The Living Sea&quot;.

==Rediscovery and recreational dive site==

Following Cousteau&#x27;s visit, the site was forgotten about except by local fishermen. In the early 1990s, Sharm el-Sheikh began to develop as a diving resort. Recreational diving on &quot;Thistlegorm&quot; restarted following the visit of the dive boat &quot;Poolster&quot;, using information from another Israeli fishing boat captain.

The massive explosion that sank her had blown much of her midships superstructure away and makes the wreck very accessible to divers. The depth of around 30 m (100 feet) at its deepest is ideal for diving without the need for specialist equipment and training.

The wreck attracts many divers for the amount of the cargo that can be seen and explored. Boots and motorcycles are visible in Hold No. 1. Trucks, motorcycles, Wellington boots, rifles, Westland Lysander wings, about twenty Bristol Mercury radial engine exhaust rings and a handful of cylinders and Bristol Blenheim bomber tailplanes are visible in Hold No. 2. Universal Carrier armoured vehicles, RAF trolley accumulators, and two Pundit Lights can also be found. Off to the port side of the wreck level with the blast area can be found one of the steam locomotives which had been stored as deck cargo and the other locomotive is off the starboard side level with Hold No. 2.
In 2007 &quot;The Times&quot; named &quot;Thistlegorm&quot; as one of the top ten wreck diving sites in the world. The wreck is rapidly disintegrating due to natural rusting. The dive boats that rely on the wreck for their livelihood are also tearing the wreck apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the wreck, leading to the collapse of parts of the wreck. For this reason, in December 2007 the non-governmental Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) installed 32 mooring buoys around the wreck and drilled holes in the hull to allow trapped air to escape. During this work, the ship was closed off to recreational diving. However, by 2009 none of these moorings remained as the blocks themselves were too light. Moored ships dragged them and the lines connecting the moorings to the wreck were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual wreck). All boats now moor directly to the wreck again.

Common interesting animals around the wreck are tuna, barracuda, batfish, moray eel, lionfish, stonefish, crocodilefish, scorpionfish, and sea turtle.

In February 2021 it was announced that Simon Brown was the winner of the General Science category of the Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Science Photographer of the Year for his orthophoto (aerial photograph adjusted to have uniform scale) of the submerged wreck of &quot;Thistlegorm&quot;, made from 15,005 merged frames.

<text>Sir James Ramsay Montagu Butler, (20 July 1889 – 1 March 1975) was a British politician and academic. He was a member of parliament for Cambridge University from 1922 to 1923. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge from 1947 to 1954, and vice-master of Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1954 to 1960. He also saw military service during both the First and Second World Wars.

==Early life and education==
Butler was born at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father, Henry Montagu Butler (1833–1918), Cambridge senior classic in 1855, was master of the college (1886–1918). His mother, Montagu Butler&#x27;s second wife, Agnata Frances Ramsay, attained the highest marks in the Classical Tripos at Cambridge in 1887. With this impeccable classical background, Butler attended Harrow School and then Trinity College. As an undergraduate he was a brilliant scholar, winning a number of prizes including the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal in Classics and the Craven Scholarship, and gaining a double first class in Classics and History. He was also president of the Cambridge Union in 1910.

==Career==
When the First World War broke out in 1914, he joined the Scottish Horse. This was a regiment in the Yeomanry, and it saw service in the Middle East, first in the Gallipoli Campaign and then Egypt. Butler next gained a position in the Directorate of Military Operations in the War Office and ended the war serving in the general staff of the British forces in France. His service led to him being appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and he was twice mentioned in despatches.

At the end of the war Butler returned to Cambridge. In 1922 he stood as a member of parliament for Cambridge University. His greatest achievement during his short tenure in the House of Commons was the passage of the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Act 1922, which put into law the proposals of the Royal Commission established in 1919 to review the organisation and constitutions of the universities and the statutes of their colleges. He was defeated in the 1923 general election by his cousin Sir George Butler. Promotion to tutor came in 1928, a lectureship in history in 1929 and then as senior tutor in 1931.

Another world war intervened in his academic career. During the Second World War, Butler returned to military service in the Army Intelligence Corps, recruiting many former students including Bernard Willson to work on code breaking at Bletchley Park. From 1942 he worked in the field of civil affairs and military government, with particular focus on France. After the conclusion of hostilities, he was appointed editor United Kingdom Military Series of the &quot;History of the Second World War&quot; by the Prime Minister Clement Attlee. He was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History in 1947, holding the chair until 1954. He wrote two of the volumes concerning grand strategy published in that series. In 1958 he was given a knighthood for his work on the books. Butler resigned his chair in 1954 and was then appointed emeritus professor. The following year he was elected vice-master of Trinity College, a post he held until 1960.

<text>Croxdale is a village in the civil parish of Croxdale and Hett, situated about south of Durham City, in County Durham, England and on the A167 road, formerly part of the Great North Road. It is on the route of the East Coast Main Line and at one time had a station. The railway crosses over Croxdale Viaduct, built in 1872, just north of the village. The Weardale Way long distance footpath passes through the nearby Croxdale Hall estate.

==History==

The village originates from a small settlement around Croxdale Hall which is about half a mile to the north east of the modern village. First mentioned in records as Crokesteil in 1195 the name may come from a Viking named Krokr and the shape of the river bends that meander like a tail.
Ownership of Croxdale dates back to 1291 when it was owned by a Roger Routhberi. By the 1350s ownership of Croxdale had passed to Robert de Whalton a treasurer of Brittany. De Whalton&#x27;s granddaughter Agnes married a Gerard Salvin in 1409 and the Croxdale estates passed to the Salvin family who still own Croxdale Hall and the surrounding estate to this day. For centuries the owner of Croxdale Hall has gone by the name Gerard Salvin, the family were noted Roman Catholics and had to keep a low profile for centuries due to Catholic persecutions. The original or old Croxdale consists of Croxdale Hall and surrounding buildings which include a chapel, farm houses and hay barn. Most of these buildings are listed and can be easily seen by following the Weardale Way public footpath across the estate.

Located just to the north of Croxdale (to the left of the A167) is Burn Hall which was designed and built in 1821 by Durham architect Ignatius Bonomi for the Salvin family. The cost of owning and maintaining two grand halls proved prohibitive and it was sold in 1926 to Roman Catholic missionaries who used it to train boys as missionary priests. In 1995 it was sold again and became luxury apartments.

The modern village of Croxdale exists because of coal mining coming to the area. Croxdale Pit was opened in 1845. This venture was carried out by the Salvin family of Croxdale Hall but lasted only a few decades, closing by 1870. At this time St. Bartholomew&#x27;s church was built by Salvin for the miners who were attracted to work in the colliery. In exchange for the ancient chapel situated on the nearby Croxdale Estate, Gerard Salvin, Esq., gave the site of this church, the old chapel now being used as a mortuary chapel for the Salvin family. St. Bartholomew&#x27;s churchyard is the final resting place of James Finlay Weir Johnston the founder of Durham Johnston School in nearby Durham City. 1875 saw a return of coal mining as the Weardale Iron and Coal Company opened Croxdale Colliery just to the south of Sunderland Bridge. This mine producing coal, fireclay and coke and employing, at its peak, over 900 workers. Housing was built to accommodate mine workers and their families, a Methodist chapel completed in 1877 and a school built in 1878-79 (now the community centre) as well as St. Bartholomew&#x27;s being extended in 1878. The main streets in the new mining village were named after the people who provided the finance to build the housing, Salvin Street and Rogerson, Johnson and Foster Terraces. So successful was the colliery that John Rogerson (one of the four directors of the Weardale Iron and Coal Company) rented Croxdale Hall from the Salvin family for a time. The colliery closed in 1934.

Until 1938 Croxdale had a railway station served by the North Eastern Railway.

During World War 2 the village was home to a munitions factory, after the war this became the NESS furniture factory. This closed in 2015. From 2017 the former factory was converted into a business hub with offices, service yards and storage and distribution facilities with planning permission to potentially add housing at a later date.

==Community==
The village has a corner shop (formerly the village post office), two public houses: The Daleside, a traditional English style pub and The Croxdale Inn/Penash, an Indian restaurant and bar. There is a play park for the children of the village which was funded by a series of summer fun days. The village also has a football pitch and allotments.

The church built in 1845 and dedicated to St. Bartholomew was built in the Norman style. It consists of nave, chancel, and western tower and is situated at the western extremity of the village of Sunderland Bridge.

The community centre is in the old school hall. It hosts various clubs and acts as the polling station on election days.

<text>The Jokhang (, ), or the Ra sa &#x27;phrul snang gtsug lag khang, or Qoikang Monastery, or Zuglagkang ( or Tsuklakang), is considered the &quot;heart of Lhasa&quot;. The Jokhang consists of a Tibetan Buddhist temple, its temple complex, and a Gelug school monastery. Located in Barkhor Square, it was built in c.640 by King Songsten Gampo to house the Jowo Mikyo Dorje, a statue of Akshobhya Buddha, brought to Tibet by his Nepalese queen, Bhrikuti. Another statue, the Jowo Shakyamuni, brought by his Tang Chinese queen Wencheng, is currently housed in the temple and the Jowo Mikyo Dorje is housed in the Ramoche, in Lhasa.

Many Nepalese and Indian artists and craftsmen worked on the temple&#x27;s original design and construction. Around the 14th century, the temple was associated with the Vajrasana in India. In the 18th century the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, following the Nepalese Gorkha invasion of Tibet in 1792, did not allow the Nepalese to visit this temple and it became an exclusive place of worship for the Tibetans. During the Chinese Cultural Revolution in Tibet, the Red Guards attacked the Jokhang temple in 1966 and for a decade there was no worship. During the Chinese development of Lhasa, the Barkhor Square in front of the temple was encroached. Renovation of the Jokhang took place from 1972 to 1980. In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Potala Palace, which has been a World Heritage Site since 1994.

==Location==
The temple, considered the &quot;spiritual heart of the city&quot; and the most sacred in Tibet, is at the center of an ancient network of Buddhist temples in Lhasa. It is the focal point of commercial activity in the city, with a maze of streets radiating from it. The Jokhang is east of the Potala Palace. Barkhor, the market square in central Lhasa, has a walkway for pilgrims to walk around the temple (which takes about 20 minutes). Barkhor Square is marked by four stone (incense burners), two of which are in front of the temple and two in the rear.

==Etymology==
&quot;Rasa Thrulnag Tsuklakhang&quot; (&quot;House of Mysteries&quot; or &quot;House of Religious Science&quot;) was the Jokhang&#x27;s ancient name. When King Songtsen Gampo built the temple, his capital city was known as &quot;Rasa&quot; (&quot;Goats&quot;), since goats were used to move earth during its construction. After the king&#x27;s death, the city became known as Lhasa (Place of the Gods). Later, the temple was called the Jokhang —&quot;House of the Jowo&quot;— derived from Jowo Mikyo Dorje, its primary image. The Jokhang&#x27;s Chinese name is &quot;Dazhao&quot; (Monastery of Great Distinction); it is also known as Zuglagkang, Qoikang Monastery Tsuglakhang (Chapel of Jowo Śākyamuni) and Tsuglhakhange.

==History==
King Songtsen Gampo (the first king of a unified Tibet) developed a plan to build twelve temples across the country. The temples were built in three stages. In the first stage central Tibet was covered with four temples, known as the &quot;four horns&quot; &quot;(ru bzhi)&quot;. Four more temples, &quot;(mtha&#x27;dul)&quot;, were built in the outer areas in the second stage; the last four, the &quot;yang&#x27;dul&quot;, were built on the country&#x27;s frontiers. The Jokhang temple was finally built in the heart of Tibet. 
To forge ties with neighboring Nepal, Songtsen Gampo sent envoys to King Amsuvarman seeking his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage and the king accepted. His daughter, Bhrikuti, came to Tibet as the king&#x27;s Nepalese wife (&quot;tritsun&quot;; in Tibetan). The image of Akshobhya Buddha known as Jowo Mikyo Dorje (or Mikyoba), which she had brought as part of her dowry, was deified in the Jokhang.

Songsten Gampo, wishing to obtain a wife from China, sent his ambassador to Emperor Taizong (627–650) of the Tang dynasty for one of his daughters. Taizong rejected the king&#x27;s proposal, considering Tibetans &quot;barbarians&quot;, and announced the marriage of one of his daughters to the king of Duyu, a Hun. This infuriated Songsten Gampo, who mounted attacks on tribal areas affiliated with the Tang dynasty and then attacked the Tang city of Songzhou. Telling the emperor that he would escalate his aggression unless the emperor agreed to his proposal, Songsten Gampo sent a conciliatory gift of a gold-studded &quot;suit of armour&quot; with another request for marriage. Taizong conceded, giving Princess Wencheng to the Tibetan king. When Wencheng went to Tibet in 640 as the Chinese wife of the king (known as &quot;Gyasa&quot; in Tibet), she brought an image of Sakyamuni Buddha, as a young prince. The image was deified in Ramoche temple in Lhasa. It was later moved to the Jokhang. The temple remains the holiest shrine in Tibet and the image, known as Jowo Rinpoche, has become the country&#x27;s most-revered statue.

The oldest part of the temple was built in 652 by Songtsen Gampo. To find a location for the temple, the king reportedly tossed his hat (a ring in another version) ahead of him with a promise to build a temple where the hat landed. It landed in a lake, where a white stupa (memorial monument) suddenly emerged over which the temple was built. In another version of the legend, Queen Bhrikuti founded the temple to install the statue she had brought. The lake was filled, leaving a small pond now visible as a well fed by the ancient lake, and a temple was built on the filled area. Over the next nine centuries, the temple was enlarged; its last renovation was carried out in 1610 by the Fifth Dalai Lama.

The temple&#x27;s design and construction are attributed to Nepalese craftsmen. After Songtsen Gampo&#x27;s death, Queen Wencheng reportedly moved the statue of Jowo from the Ramoche temple to the Jokhang temple to secure it from Chinese attack. The part of the temple known as the Chapel was the hiding place of the Jowo Sakyamuni.

During the reign of King Tresang Detsan from 755 to 797, Buddhists were persecuted because the king&#x27;s minister, Marshang Zongbagyi (a devotee of Bon), was hostile to Buddhism. During this time the image of Akshobya Buddha in the Jokhang temple was hidden underground, reportedly 200 people failed to locate it. The images in the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were moved to Jizong in Ngari, and the monks were persecuted and driven from Jokhang. During the anti-Buddhist activity of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Jokhang and Ramoche temples were said to be used as stables. In 1049 Atisha, a renowned teacher of Buddhism from Bengal who taught in Jokhang and died in 1054, found the &quot;Royal Testament of the Pillar&quot; &quot;(Bka&#x27; chems ka khol ma)&quot; in a pillar at Jokhang; the document was said to be the testament of Songtsen Gampo.
Beginning in about the 14th century, the temple was associated with the Vajrasana in India. It is said that the image of Buddha deified in the Jokhang is the 12-year-old Buddha earlier located in the Bodh Gaya Temple in India, indicating &quot;historical and ritual&quot; links between India and Tibet. Tibetans call Jokhang the &quot;Vajrasana of Tibet&quot; &quot;(Bod yul gyi rDo rje gdani)&quot;, the &quot;second Vajrasana&quot; &quot;(rDo rje gdan pal)&quot; and &quot;Vajrasan, the navel of the land of snow&quot; &quot;(Gangs can sa yi lte ba rDo rje gdani)&quot;.

After the occupation of Nepal by the Gorkhas in 1769, during the Gorkha-Tibetan war in 1792 the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty drove the Gorkhas from Tibet and the Tibetans were isolated from their neighbors. The period, lasting for more than a century, has been called &quot;the Dark Age of Tibet&quot;. Pilgrimages outside the country were forbidden for Tibetans, and the Qianlong Emperor suggested that it would be equally effective to worship the Jowo Buddha at the Jokhang.

In Chinese development of Lhasa, Barkhor Square was encroached when the walkway around the temple was destroyed. An inner walkway was converted into a plaza, leaving only a short walkway as a pilgrimage route. In the square, religious objects related to the pilgrimage are sold.

During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards attacked the Jokhang in 1966, starting on August 24, and for a decade there was no worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this and the end of persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple&#x27;s inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel.

Two flagstone &quot;doring&quot; (inscribed pillars) outside the temple, flanking its north and south entrances, are worshiped by Tibetans. The first monument, a March 1794 edict known as the &quot;Forever Following Tablet&quot; in Chinese, records advice on hygiene to prevent smallpox; some has been chiseled out by Tibetans who believed that the stone itself had curative powers. The second, far older, pillar is high with a crown in the shape of a palace and an inscription dated 821 or 822. The tablet has a number of names; &quot;Number One Tablet in Asia&quot;, &quot;Lhasa Alliance Tablet&quot;, &quot;Changing Alliance Tablet&quot;, &quot;Uncle and Nephew Alliance Tablet&quot; and the &quot;Tang Dynasty-Tubo Peace Alliance Tablet&quot;. Its inscription, in Tibetan and Chinese, is a treaty between the Tibetan king Ralpacan and the Chinese emperor Muzong delineating the boundary between their countries. Both inscriptions were enclosed by brick walls when Barkhor Square was developed in 1985. The Sino-Tibetan treaty reads, &quot;Tibet and China shall abide by the frontiers of which they are now in occupation. All to the east is the country of Great China; and all to the west is, without question, the country of Great Tibet. Henceforth on neither side shall there be waging of war nor seizing of territory. If any person incurs suspicion he shall be arrested; his business shall be inquired into and he shall be escorted back&quot;.

According to the Dalai Lama, among the many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was believed to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.

In 2000, the Jokhang became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as an extension of the Potala Palace (a World Heritage Site since 1994) to facilitate conservation efforts. The temple is listed in the first group of National Cultural Protection Relic Units, and has been categorized as a 4A-level tourist site.

On February 17, 2018, the temple caught fire at 6:40 p.m. (local time), before sunset in Lhasa, with the blaze lasting until late that evening. Although photos and videos about the fire were spread on Chinese social media, which showed the eaved roof of a section of the building lit with roaring yellow flames and emitting a haze of smoke, these images were quickly censored and disappeared. The official newspaper &quot;Tibet Daily&quot; briefly claimed online that the fire was &quot;quickly extinguished&quot; with &quot;no deaths or injuries&quot; at the late night, while The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published the same words online and added that there had been &quot;no damage to relics&quot; in the temple; both of these reports contained no photos. The temple was temporarily closed after the fire but were reopened to public on February 18.

==Architecture==
The Jokhang temple covers an area of . When it was built during the seventh century, it had eight rooms on two floors to house scriptures and sculptures of the Buddha. The temple had brick-lined floors, columns and door frames and carvings made of wood. During the Tubo period, there was conflict between followers of Buddhism and the indigenous Bon religion. Changes in dynastic rule affected the Jokhang Monastery; after 1409, during the Ming dynasty, many improvements were made to the temple. The second and third floors of the Buddha Hall and the annex buildings were built during the 11th century. The main hall is the four-story Buddha Hall. 

The temple has an east-west orientation, facing Nepal to the west in honour of Princess Bhrikuti. Additionally, the monastery&#x27;s main gate faces west. The Jokhang is aligned along an axis, beginning with an arch gate and followed by the Buddha Hall, an enclosed passage, a cloister, atriums and a hostel for the &quot;lamas&quot; (monks). Inside the entrance are four &quot;Guardian Kings&quot; &quot;(Chokyong)&quot;, two on each side. The main shrine is on the ground floor. On the first floor are murals, residences for the monks and a private room for the Dalai Lama, and there are residences for the monks and chapels on all four sides of the shrine. The temple is made of wood and stone. Its architecture features the Tibetan Buddhist style, with influences from China, Indian vihara design and Nepal. The roof is covered with gilded bronze tiles, figurines and decorated pavilions.
The central Buddha Hall is tall, with a large, paved courtyard. A porch leads to the open courtyard, which is two concentric circles with two temples: one in the outer circle and another in the inner circle. The outer circle has a circular path, with a number of large prayer wheels (&quot;nangkhor&quot;); this path leads to the main shrine, which is surrounded by chapels. Only one of the temple murals remains, depicting the arrival of Queen Wencheng and an image of the Buddha. The image, brought by the king&#x27;s Nepalese wife and initially kept at Ramoche, was moved to Jokhang and kept in the rear center of the inner temple. This Buddha has remained on a platform since the eighth century; on a number of occasions, it was moved for safekeeping. The image, amidst those of the king and his two consorts, has been gilded several times. In the main hall on the ground floor is a gilded bronze statue of Jowo Sakyamuni, tall, representing the Buddha at age twelve. The image has a bejeweled crown, cover around its shoulder, a diamond on its forehead and wears a pearl-studded garment. The Buddha is seated in a lotus position on a three-tiered lotus throne, with his left hand on his lap and his right hand touching the earth. A number of chapels surround the Jowo Sakayamuni, dedicated to gods and bodhisattvas. The most important bodhisattva here is the Avalokiteshwara, the patron saint of Tibet, with a thousand eyes and a thousand arms. Flanking the main hall are halls for Amitabha (the Buddha of the past) and Qamba (the Buddha of the future). Incarnations of Sakyamuni are enshrined on either side of a central axis, and the Buddha&#x27;s warrior guard is in the middle of the halls on the left side.

In addition to the main hall and its adjoining halls, on both sides of the Buddha Hall are dozens of chapels. The Prince of Dharma chapel is on the third floor, including sculptures of Songtsen Gampo, Princess Wencheng, Princess Bhrikuti, Gar Tongtsan (the Tabo minister) and Thonmi Sambhota, the inventor of Tibetan script. The halls are surrounded by enclosed walkways.

Decorations of winged apsaras, human and animal figurines, flowers and grasses are carved on the superstructure. Images of sphinxes with a variety of expressions are carved below the roof.

The temple complex has more than 3,000 images of the Buddha and other deities (including an image of the Buddha) and historical figures, in addition to manuscripts and other objects. The temple walls are decorated with religious and historical murals.
On the rooftop and roof ridges are iconic statues of golden deer flanking a Dharma wheel, victory flags and monstrous fish. The temple interior is a dark labyrinth of chapels, illuminated by votive candles and filled with incense. Although portions of the temple has been rebuilt, original elements remain. The wooden beams and rafters have been shown by carbon dating to be original, and the Newari door frames, columns and finials dating to the seventh and eighth centuries were brought from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal.

In addition to walking around the temple and spinning prayer wheels, pilgrims prostrate themselves before approaching the main deity; some crawl a considerable distance to the main shrine. The prayer chanted during this worship is &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot; (Hail to the jewel in the lotus). Pilgrims queue on both sides of the platform to place a ceremonial scarf (&quot;katak&quot;) around the Buddha&#x27;s neck or touch the image&#x27;s knee. A walled enclosure in front of the Jokhang, near the Tang Dynasty-Tubo Peace Alliance Tablet, contains the stump of a willow known as the &quot;Tang Dynasty Willow&quot; or the &quot;Princess Willow&quot;. The willow was reportedly planted by Princess Wencheng.

==Buddhist scriptures and sculptures==
The Jokhang has a sizable, significant collection of cultural artifacts, including Tang-dynasty bronze sculptures and finely-sculpted figures in different shapes from the Ming dynasty. The book &quot;108 Buddhist Statues in Tibet&quot; by Ulrich von Schroeder, published in 2008, contains a DVD with digital photographs of the 419 most important Buddhist sculptures in the collection of the Jokhang .
Among hundreds of thangkas, two notable paintings of Chakrasamvara and Yamantaka date to the reign of the Yongle Emperor; both are embroidered on silk and well-preserved. The collection also has 54 boxes of Tripiṭaka printed in red, 108 carved sandalwood boxes with sutras and a vase (a gift from the Qianlong Emperor) used to select the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.

<text>Brian William Haw (7 January 1949 – 18 June 2011) was a British protester and peace campaigner who lived for almost ten years in a peace camp in London&#x27;s Parliament Square from 2001, in a protest against UK and US foreign policy. He began the Parliament Square Peace Campaign before the September 11 attacks, and became a symbol of the anti-war movement over the policies of both the United Kingdom and the United States in Afghanistan and later Iraq. At the 2007 Channel 4 Political Awards he was voted Most Inspiring Political Figure. Haw died of cancer in Berlin, where he had been receiving medical treatment.

==Early and personal life==

Haw was born on 7 January 1949, in Wanstead Hospital, in Woodford Green, Essex a twin and the eldest of six. He grew up in neighbouring Barking and in Whitstable, Kent.

His father, Robert William Haw (1925–1964), served as a sniper in the Reconnaissance Corps in the Second World War, and had been one of the first British soldiers to enter the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He later worked as a railway clerk, and also worked in a betting office. He took his own life when Haw was 13. Haw&#x27;s mother was Iris Marie Haw (née Hall).

Haw&#x27;s family were involved in an evangelical Christian church in Whitstable, which Haw joined when he was aged 11. Haw was apprenticed to a boat-builder from the age of 16 and then entered the Merchant Navy as a deckhand. He travelled widely before spending six months at evangelical college in Nottingham, after which he preached world peace. Haw visited Northern Ireland in 1970 during The Troubles, as well as the Killing Fields of Cambodia in 1989.

After returning to London, he worked as a removals man and as a carpenter, and later with youth in Redditch, Worcestershire. He married his wife Kay in Redbridge in June 1977. They lived in Redditch with their seven children until he left them in 2001 to begin his Parliament Square protest. The couple divorced in 2003.

==Parliament Square protests==
On 2 June 2001, he began camping in Parliament Square in central London in a one-man political protest against war and foreign policy (initially, the Economic sanctions against Iraq). By his own account, he was first inspired to take up his vigil after seeing the images and information produced by the Mariam Appeal, an anti-sanctions campaign. Haw justified his campaign on a need to improve his children&#x27;s future. He only left his makeshift campsite to attend court hearings, surviving on food brought by supporters. Support for Haw&#x27;s protest came from former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn and activist/comedian Mark Thomas. Among the artwork displayed was a Banksy stencil of two soldiers painting over a peace sign and Leon Kuhn&#x27;s anti-war political caricature &quot;3 Guilty Men&quot;, which, together with Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Proud Parents&quot;, Mark Wallinger later displayed in his recreation at the Tate in 2007.

He originally camped on the grass in Parliament Square, but the Greater London Authority took legal action to remove him, so he relocated to the pavement, which was administered by Westminster City Council instead. In October 2002 Westminster City Council attempted to prosecute Haw for causing an obstruction to the pavement, but the case failed as Haw&#x27;s banners did not impede movement. The continuous use of a megaphone by Haw led to objections by Members of Parliament who had offices close to Haw&#x27;s protest camp. The House of Commons Procedure Committee held a brief inquiry in summer 2003 which heard evidence that permanent protests in Parliament Square could provide an opportunity for terrorists to disguise explosive devices, and resulted in a recommendation that the law be changed to prohibit them. The Government passed a provision banning all unlicensed protests, permanent or otherwise, in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (sections 132 to 138); however, because Haw&#x27;s protest was on-going and residing on Parliament Square prior to the enactment of the Act, it was unclear whether the Act applied to him.

In the 2005 general election Haw stood as a candidate in the Cities of London and Westminster in order to further his campaign and oppose the Act which was yet to come into force. He won 298 votes (0.8 per cent), making a speech against the ongoing presence of UK troops in Iraq at the declaration of the result.

===Legal action===

As preparation for implementing the new Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 began, Haw won an application for judicial review on 28 July 2005, successfully arguing that a technical defect in the act meant it did not apply in his case. The act states that demonstrations must have authorisation from the police &quot;when the demonstration starts&quot;, and Haw asserted that his demonstration had begun before the passage of the act, which was not made retrospective. Although the commencement order made to bring the act into force had made reference to demonstrations begun before the act came into force, there was no power for the commencement order to extend the scope of the act.

The government appealed against the judgement, and on 8 May 2006 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and therefore declared that the act did apply to him. The court found that the intent of parliament was clearly to apply to all demonstrations in Parliament Square regardless of when they had begun, saying &quot;The only sensible conclusion to reach in these circumstances is that Parliament intended that those sections of the Act should apply to a demonstration in the designated area, whether it started before or after they came into force. Any other conclusion would be wholly irrational and could fairly be described as manifestly absurd.&quot;

In the meantime Haw had applied for permission to continue his demonstration, and received it on condition that his display of placards was no more than wide (among other things). Haw was unwilling to comply and the police referred his case to the Crown Prosecution Service; a number of supporters began camping with him in order to deter attempts to evict him.
In the early hours of 23 May 2006, 78 police arrived and removed all but one of Haw&#x27;s placards citing continual breached conditions of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 as their reason for doing so. Ian Blair (head of the Metropolitan Police at the time) later said that the operation to remove Haw&#x27;s placards had cost £27,000. The actions of the police were criticised by members of the Metropolitan Police Authority at its monthly meeting on 25 May 2006. Haw appeared at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court on 30 May, when he refused to enter a plea. The court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, and he was bailed to return to court on 11 July 2006. At a licensing hearing at Westminster City Council on 30 June 2006, Haw was granted limited permission to use a loudspeaker in the space allowed to him.

On 22 January 2007 Haw was acquitted on the grounds that the conditions he was accused of breaching were not sufficiently clear, and that they should have been imposed by a police officer of higher rank. District Judge Purdy ruled: &quot;I find the conditions, drafted as they are, lack clarity and are not workable in their current form.&quot; At the 2007 Channel 4 Political Awards Haw was voted Most Inspiring Political Figure.

===Documentary===
Haw was featured in several documentaries including 2003&#x27;s &quot;As Long As It Takes&quot; (Raj Yagnik). Haw was briefly portrayed in the 2007 drama &quot;The Trial of Tony Blair&quot;.

Haw was filmed for many months by independent documentary maker Senara Wilson during the buildup to war in 2003. Her film &quot;Life of Brian&quot; (produced and edited by Matthew Platts-Mills) was selected for the Commonwealth Film Festival. A short version of this documentary is available here. &quot;A Man Called Brian&quot; was a 2005 documentary film by Mahmoud Shoolizadeh about Haw and his ten-year, 24/7 anti-war protest in Parliament Square.

Haw was featured with activist Mick Meaney in a documentary by British independent news agency RINF, in which for the first time in the media he stated that he believed &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot;.

==&quot;Director of Public Prosecutions v Haw&quot;==
In the case of &quot;Director of Public Prosecutions v Haw&quot;, the judgement of the court, delivered by Lord Phillips CJ, included the following:
This was an adjourned hearing of an appeal by way of case stated by the Director of Public Prosecutions against a decision of District Judge Purdy in the City of Westminster Magistrates Court on 22 January 2007. The judge ruled that there was no case for the Respondent, Brian Haw, to answer on a charge of knowingly failing to comply with a condition imposed under Section 134 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (&#x27;SOCA&#x27;) in respect of a demonstration in Parliament Square. The hearing before the Administrative Court was adjourned because Mr Haw had not been served with relevant documents in time to give them proper consideration.

Haw sought a large number of directions from the court on 18 November 2008. After some delay the directions of the court were eventually published in March 2009:
* &quot;Haw, R (on the application of) v Southwark Crown Court &amp; Ors&quot; [2009] EWHC 379 (Admin) (3 March 2009) 
The court was un-persuaded that a full transcript of the hearing was necessary, even though Haw claimed that it would show that the court sidestepped the issue as to the legality of the seizure.

==&quot;Tucker v Director of Public Prosecutions&quot;==
The case of &quot;Tucker v Director of Public Prosecutions&quot;, 2007 was an appeal by way of case stated. The appellant, Barbara Tucker, was convicted under Section 132 (1)(c) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA), of being within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, and carrying on unauthorised demonstration by herself in a public place in a designated area, namely Parliament Square. Her defence was that Haw had invited her to join him in his demonstration. He gave evidence on her behalf to that effect.

The magistrate said: &quot;Had I accepted this evidence (which I did not) it would have been argued that the allegation that she had &#x27;carried on an unauthorised demonstration by herself ...&#x27; could not have been made out, and furthermore (in my view incorrectly) that it would provide a defence by saying that as Mr Haw is safe from prosecution anyone who joins him is also safe.&quot; The question posed by the magistrate was: &quot;Was it lawful under section 6 (1) HRA to convict the appellant?&quot; The Administrative Court held that SOCPA was not incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (specifically, Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 11 (freedom of assembly)), and that Tucker&#x27;s conviction was therefore lawful.

==January 2008 injury and arrest==
On 12 January 2008, Haw was observing a protest against the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act outside Downing Street. Seven people were arrested including Haw, who said &quot;I was filming the students lying down in the road when one officer stepped forward, as I was walking back, and pushed the camera with his hand. It struck my face.&quot; He used &quot;violent and humiliating force&quot;.

==2008 London mayoral elections==
In December 2007 press releases stated that Haw had declared himself a candidate in the London Mayoral Elections in May 2008, but eventually he did not stand. On 17 April 2008 he gave his support to the Christian Choice candidate Alan Craig.

==25 May 2010 arrest==
On 25 May 2010 the day of the State Opening of Parliament for the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, Haw was arrested at 8:30 am.

==Illness and death==
In September 2010 Haw was diagnosed with lung cancer. On 1 January 2011 he left England to receive treatment in Berlin. Haw, who was described as a chain smoker, continued to smoke cigarettes until his death. Haw died in Germany in the early hours of 18 June 2011 of lung cancer. He is survived by seven children.

Reacting to news of Haw&#x27;s death, Tony Benn said &quot;Brian Haw was a man of principle ... his death marks the end of a historic enterprise by a man who gave everything to support his beliefs&quot;. At his death Al Jazeera described him as an &quot;unsung hero&quot;. Mark Wallinger said &quot;I admired [Haw&#x27;s] single-minded tenacity. His rectitude was a mirror that the people in the building opposite couldn&#x27;t bear. ... Now that he&#x27;s gone, who else have we got?&quot;. The British MP John McDonnell has called for a statue of Haw to be assembled to celebrate peace. British artist Banksy honoured Haw with a tribute on his website. Banksy had previously described Haw as &#x27;the best inspiration in London&#x27; in a hand written dedication to him in a copy of the book &quot;Wall and Peace&quot;. 

in 2011 London Assembly Member Jenny Jones called for Westminster Council to erect a blue plaque for Brian Haw immediately, bypassing English Heritage&#x27;s criteria that the person commemorated should have been dead for two decades or passed the centenary of their birth, whichever is the earlier. 

In 2018, artist Guy Atkins sited an audio monument to Brian Haw in Parliament Square. Conceived within the tradition of countermonuments, the audio work - &#x27;And There Was Brian&#x27; - can only be heard in the Square through the monument&#x27;s GPS-restricted website, andtherewasbrian.uk. The monument gives an account of Brian Haw&#x27;s protest through the experiences of his longest-serving supporter, actor Michael Culver.

In 2023 Actor Sir Mark Rylance headed a crowdfunding campaign to erect a small bronze maquette on a plinth opposite the big guns of the Imperial War Museum in Lambeth.

==In culture==
In January 2007, former Turner Prize nominee Mark Wallinger recreated Brian Haw&#x27;s Parliament Square protest in its entirety as an exhibition at Tate Britain, titled State Britain. Running the length of the Duveen Gallery, &quot;State Britain&quot; was a painstaking reconstruction of the display confiscated by the Metropolitan Police in 2006. It included 500 weather-worn banners, photos, peace flags, and messages from well-wishers collected by Haw over the duration of the Peace Protest, as well as his self-constructed shelter. In December 2007 Wallinger&#x27;s work won the Turner Prize.

The London-based band XX Teens recorded a song &quot;For Brian Haw&quot;, which was included on their 2008 album &quot;Welcome To Goon Island&quot;. The track incorporated a statement by Haw himself about his motivations for the protest.

Haw was featured in the short length documentary &quot;Maria: 24hr Peace Picket&quot; by Iranian film director Parviz Jahed, about fellow peace campaigner Maria Gallastegui.

In 2009, Youth Music Theatre UK developed the music theatre production &quot;According to Brian Haw...&quot; based on reactions by young people to Haw&#x27;s life, 9/11 and the Iraq war. This was performed at the Barbican Theatre, Plymouth. This production was again performed in 2012 at Square Chapel Centre for the Arts in Halifax with a new cast of young people. It was developed from a concept by Eddie Latter, music by James Atherton, book and lyrics by Sarah Nelson, directed by Ellie Jones, movement by Eddie Latter, designed by Hannah Boothman.

Zia Trench&#x27;s debut play, &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot;, based on Haw&#x27;s life, was performed for the first time at the 2009 Edinburgh Fringe, featuring Michael Byrne in the lead role and directed by Justin Butcher.

<doc id="1205045" wikidata="Q585923" url="?curid=1205045" title="The Madcap Laughs">
<text>The Madcap Laughs is the debut solo album by the English singer-songwriter Syd Barrett. It was recorded after Barrett had left Pink Floyd in April 1968. The album had a lengthy recording history, with work beginning in May 1968, but the bulk of the sessions taking place between April and July 1969, for which five different producers were credited − including Barrett, Peter Jenner (1968 sessions), Malcolm Jones (early-to-mid-1969 sessions), and fellow Pink Floyd members David Gilmour and Roger Waters (mid-1969 sessions). Among the guest musicians are Willie Wilson from Gilmour&#x27;s old band Jokers Wild and several members of Soft Machine.

&quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;, released in January 1970 on Harvest in the UK but not released in the US until 1974, enjoyed minimal commercial success on release, reaching number 40 on the UK&#x27;s official albums chart. It was re-released in 1974 as part of &quot;Syd Barrett&quot; (which contained &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Barrett&quot;), which saw the first US issue of the two LPs. The album was remastered and reissued in 1993, along with Barrett&#x27;s other albums, &quot;Barrett&quot; (1970) and &quot;Opel&quot; (1988), independently and as part of the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; box set. A newly remastered version was released in 2010.

==Background==
In the second half of 1967 and through to early 1968, when still part of Pink Floyd, Barrett&#x27;s behaviour became increasingly erratic and unpredictable. Many report having seen him on stage with the group during this period, strumming on one chord through an entire concert or not playing at all. In August 1967, Pink Floyd were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Band manager Peter Jenner and bassist Roger Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist (an appointment he failed to attend), while a stay on the Spanish island of Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement in Barrett&#x27;s behaviour. A few dates in September were followed by the band&#x27;s first tour of the United States. At this point, Barrett&#x27;s condition grew steadily worse. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;, Barrett slowly detuned his guitar; the audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band&#x27;s consternation. Sometime in October, Jenner transferred tapes of &quot;In the Beechwoods&quot;, two takes of &quot;Vegetable Man&quot;, and a 5-minute backing track called &quot;No Title&quot;, which Jenner hoped Barrett would finish eventually.

Around Christmas 1967, guitarist David Gilmour, an old friend of Barrett&#x27;s from Cambridge, was asked by the other members of Pink Floyd to join as a second guitarist, initially not to replace Barrett, but cover for him, because his unpredictable behaviour prevented him from performing. For several shows Gilmour sang and played guitar while Barrett wandered around on stage, every now and then deciding to join in playing guitar and singing. Waters and fellow band members keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason soon grew weary of Barrett&#x27;s on-stage antics and, on 26 January 1968, when Waters was driving his bandmates from London to a show at Southampton University, they all agreed to go without Barrett: according to Gilmour&#x27;s recollection, one person asked, &quot;Shall we pick Syd up?&quot; and another said, &quot;Let&#x27;s not bother.&quot; Since Barrett had written or co-written 10 of the 11 songs on their debut album, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, as well as the band&#x27;s three singles up to this point, the original plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member − in a similar arrangement to what The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson − but this soon proved to be unworkable. At his last rehearsal with the band, he presented a new song entitled &quot;Have You Got It Yet?&quot;, which proved to be deliberately unplayable as the others attempted to join in, until they realised the joke of the title. On 6 April, the group officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member of Pink Floyd. Upon leaving the band, Barrett said to Melody Maker: &quot;I suppose it was really just a matter of being a little offhand about things&quot;.

==Recording==

===Peter Jenner sessions===
After Barrett left Pink Floyd in April 1968, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, from the band&#x27;s management, followed suit. Nick Mason later commented on Jenner &amp; King leaving with Barrett many years later: &quot;Peter and Andrew clearly felt that Syd was the creative centre of the band, a reasonable point of view given our track record up until that point. Consequently, they decided to represent him rather than us.&quot; In May, Jenner led Barrett into EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios), on Abbey Road in northwest London, to record some solo material, only part of which would later appear on &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;. Jenner thought Barrett would like to finish the tracks that Jenner transferred the previous October; Barrett on the other hand, had other plans. During these first, tentative sessions, Jenner failed to properly record any vocals at all for the tracks &quot;Golden Hair&quot;, &quot;Late Night&quot;, &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot; (later retitled &quot;Octopus&quot;), &quot;Silas Lang&quot;, or &quot;Lanky (Parts One and Two)&quot;. After recording had resumed in June and July, progress continued on these tracks, especially &quot;Swan Lee&quot;, and a new, improved version of &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot; was taped at this point also. Barrett wouldn&#x27;t commit to recording the track &quot;Rhamadam&quot; (sic) to tape properly, however.

Although Jenner claims he got on well with the singer, he would also state that the 1968 sessions had not gone smoothly, admitting: &quot;I had seriously underestimated the difficulties of working with him ...&quot; Shortly after the July dates, Barrett abruptly stopped recording, breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Corner and then going off on a drive around Britain in his Mini; he ended up in psychiatric care in Cambridge.

By the start of 1969, a somewhat recovered Barrett decided to return to his musical career and revisit the Jenner-produced recordings. He contacted EMI, and was passed on to Malcolm Jones, then-head of EMI&#x27;s new prog rock label, Harvest. After both Jenner and Norman Smith, Pink Floyd&#x27;s producer at the time, declined to work on the album, Jones agreed to take on the role.
===Malcolm Jones sessions===
Jones had little difficulty in persuading his boss, Roy Featherstone, and Ron White, authoriser of EMI recordings, to allow Barrett to record with the company again. In April 1969, the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material, while reworking the 1968 recordings. Jones would later comment that the sessions with Barrett had gone well: &quot;Syd was in a great mood, and in fine form, a stark contrast to the rumours and stories I&#x27;d been fed.&quot; Jones also explained the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again: &quot;What was decided was to see what was the strength of Syd&#x27;s new material, and plan accordingly. If it worked, then, O.K. we&#x27;d do an album. If not, we&#x27;d call it a day ...&quot; In a meeting at Barrett&#x27;s flat in Earls Court, unsure of Jenner&#x27;s production technique, Jones asked to hear some of the previous year&#x27;s tapes; Barrett played him &quot;Swan Lee&quot;, &quot;Late Night&quot;, &quot;Rhamadam&quot;, &quot;Lanky (Parts One and Two)&quot; and &quot;Golden Hair&quot;. Of these, &quot;Swan Lee&quot; had no vocals, but Jones saw potential in the song; &quot;Late Night&quot; did have vocals and, Jones remarked, &quot;a certain charm&quot;; while &quot;Golden Hair&quot; was &quot;great&quot;. After the playbacks, Barrett performed several songs on guitar for Jones: &quot;Opel&quot; and &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot; (both attempted during the sessions with Peter Jenner), and the newly written &quot;Terrapin&quot; and &quot;Love You&quot;.

The Jones-produced sessions commenced on 10 April 1969 at EMI&#x27;s Studio 3, with that day being dedicated to going through the 1968 tapes again to see what could be improved upon. The first track to be worked on was &quot;Swan Lee&quot;, which received vocal overdubs and a new guitar track, and several ideas for &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot; were considered; Barrett and Jones both felt that the results were superior to the previous versions. The following day, in about five hours, Barrett recorded vocal and guitar tracks for four recently recorded songs, starting with &quot;Opel&quot;, and two old ones. Barrett and his new producer were in agreement that &quot;Opel&quot; was among the best of the new recordings at this time; only two complete takes of the song were taped, though, after multiple false starts. The next song attempted was &quot;Love You&quot;, the first take of which featured a faster tempo than the officially released take 2. After &quot;Love You&quot;, they recorded &quot;It&#x27;s No Good Trying&quot;, which was similarly completed in just a few takes. Barrett was in &quot;great form, and very happy&quot;, Jones recalled, and &quot;very together&quot;. During the lunch break that day, they talked about improving some of the other songs from the Jenner sessions, particularly &quot;Golden Hair&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot;, the last of which was just a backing track at this point. After returning to the studio, they worked on &quot;Terrapin&quot;, with Barrett requiring just a single take, and added slide guitar and vocals to &quot;Late Night&quot;.
The following session took place on 17 April, in Studio 2 at EMI. Jones arrived there to find that Barrett had brought in friends of his as support musicians: Jerry Shirley, drummer with Humble Pie, and Willie Wilson, Jokers Wild&#x27;s drummer, although for this occasion he was playing bass. The problem with this new set-up, though, was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them live in the studio; on the released versions, a number of them have false starts and commentaries from Barrett. The first track Barrett and his fellow musicians worked on was &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, after Barrett had played through the song several times, to allow Shirley and Wilson to pick up the segments. Once the rehearsal was through, they went for a take, to check how the band sounded and to test the equipment from within the control room. After these tests, the band recorded three takes, the last of which became the master take for &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;; the bass, however, was re-recorded at a later date. Playing along with Barrett wasn&#x27;t easy, according to Jones: &quot;It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind ...&quot; Shirley said of Barrett: &quot;He gave the impression he knew something you didn&#x27;t. He had this music sort of giggle ...&quot;

Next, they recorded a song that Barrett had written in a few minutes, &quot;Here I Go&quot;, which required no overdubs at all. This session for &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; and &quot;Here I Go&quot; lasted just three hours. When asked if he had any new songs for the following week&#x27;s session, on 23 April, Barrett replied that he had &quot;a weird idea I want to try out&quot; and that other musicians would not be required. Afterwards, Barrett mentioned that he was interested in revisiting one of the Jenner tracks − &quot;Rhamadam&quot;. On the morning of the 23rd, Barrett arrived at the studio with a cassette player, on which he had recorded motorbike sounds; these, he told Jones, were &quot;all ready to [be] put onto the &#x27;Rhamadam&#x27; four track&quot;. The producer described the sound quality as &quot;terrible&quot;, an opinion that was confirmed once Barrett&#x27;s player had been hooked up to a 4-track machine. Instead it was decided that Barrett should source the motorbike sounds from EMI&#x27;s large sound effects library. The selection process took up to an hour, at which point Jones started to lose faith in Barrett. Later on, Barrett changed his mind and abandoned the idea.

The session on 25 April was almost cancelled, due to Jones becoming ill from colitis. Beforehand, it had been agreed that this session would be dedicated to transferring their previously recorded, 4-track recordings onto Studio 3&#x27;s newer 8-track machine, for further overdubs in later sessions. At Jones&#x27; suggestion, and despite warnings the producer had received that Barrett should not be in the studio unaccompanied, Barrett went in on his own to carry out the mixing. It had been decided that nearly all of the tracks that were recorded up to that point needed further overdubbing except for &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; and &quot;Here I Go&quot;. At this point, Barrett considered placing &quot;Opel&quot; on the album, Jones calls it among Barrett&#x27;s &quot;best and most haunting&quot; songs. On the session for 3 May, three tracks on the album were overdubbed by Robert Wyatt, Hugh Hopper and Mike Ratledge, all members of the band Soft Machine: The three songs were &quot;Love You&quot;, (now dropping &quot;It&#x27;s&quot;) &quot;No Good Trying&quot;, and &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot;. Even after the Soft Machine members added overdubs to &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot;, Barrett wished to add bass and drums to it.

Robert Wyatt had said that the musicians would ask &quot;What key is that in, Syd?&quot;, to which Barrett would simply reply &quot;Yeah&quot; or &quot;That&#x27;s funny&quot;. Wyatt had also offered the following comments on the sessions: &quot;Working with Syd Barrett&#x27;s a piece of cake, I think. I found him courteous and friendly. I can&#x27;t think of anything wrong with him. I really liked his songs. I liked them musically, I liked them lyrically, and I liked the way he sang them. [...] I just think that not everybody fits into the business. I know from personal experience, it&#x27;s not that easy.&quot; During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers&#x27; debut LP, &quot;Joy of a Toy&quot;, although his performance on &quot;Religious Experience&quot; was not released until the album was reissued in 2003. The next day&#x27;s session had Barrett adding backwards guitar to &quot;No Good Trying&quot;, and lead to &quot;Terrapin&quot; and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. It was around this time that Jones&#x27; involvement came to an end – during these last few sessions, Gilmour had started taking an interest in how Barrett was getting along with his album. Although Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off &quot;for an afternoon drive&quot;, he instead followed Pink Floyd out to Ibiza. During the trip, he asked David Gilmour for his help on the album, and, at the end of May, Malcolm Jones abandoned his production responsibilities.

===David Gilmour and Roger Waters sessions===
In his book &quot;The Making of the Madcap Laughs&quot;, Jones states that &quot;when Dave came to me and said that Syd wanted him and Roger to do the remaining parts of the album, I acquiesced&quot;. Roger Waters and David Gilmour were in the process of completing Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Ummagumma&quot; album when they got involved with &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; that July and helped Barrett finish his album − &quot;in a two-day sprint&quot;, according to &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; biographer Rick Sanders. &quot;We had very little time,&quot; Gilmour recalled in a May 2003 interview. &quot;Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it&#x27;s your fucking career, mate. Why don&#x27;t you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do.&quot;

In a different interview Gilmour expanded further on the rush to complete the album: 
“We were led to believe the project was going to be shelved. We were told that EMI had spent too much money on it and it was a long way from completion. An extension was negotiated on the basis that we get it finished in double-quick time. That meant not spending money. The fact that we [•••] were busy and Abbey Road’s other bookings both conspired to make the time available very short. Decisions had to be made.”
After the first session with new producers Gilmour and Waters, on 12 June, they had remade &quot;Clowns and Jugglers&quot; into &quot;Octopus&quot;, from the Soft Machine&#x27;s overdubbed version; then, they re-recorded &quot;Golden Hair&quot;, and recorded &quot;Long Gone&quot; and &quot;Dark Globe&quot;. As the following day&#x27;s session was dedicated to overdubbing &quot;Octopus&quot;, this became Barrett&#x27;s final session for over a month, due to a temporary halt while Gilmour and Waters mixed &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, to Barrett&#x27;s dismay, and a Floyd tour in the Netherlands. However, towards the end of July, on the 26th, they managed to record &quot;She Took a Long Cold Look at Me&quot;, &quot;Feel&quot;, &quot;If It&#x27;s in You&quot;, another version of &quot;Long Gone&quot;, an attempt at a re-make of &quot;Dark Globe&quot;, and even a medley of &quot;She Took&quot; / &quot;Feel&quot; / &quot;If It&#x27;s in You&quot;. Barrett would not allow the musicians to rehearse or to re-record their overdubs, insisting that they sounded fine. After several months of intermittent recording, the album was finally deemed complete. After the final recording sessions for the album had been completed, Gilmour and Waters mixed not just the tracks they had produced, but also the Jones tracks, in a matter of two days. Five tracks were mixed on 5 August: &quot;Long Gone&quot;, &quot;She Took&quot;, &quot;Feel&quot;, &quot;If It&#x27;s in You&quot;, and &quot;Octopus&quot;. The following day, three tracks, &quot;Golden Hair&quot;, &quot;Dark Globe&quot;, and &quot;Terrapin&quot;, were mixed in just three hours. The track order was sequenced by Barrett and Gilmour on 6 October.

==Release, reception, and aftermath==

&quot;Octopus&quot; was released as a single in November 1969 and &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; followed on 2 January 1970. The album was released by Harvest in the UK. It sold 6,000 copies in the first few months and reached number 40 in the UK and was fairly well-reviewed by music critics. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, reviewing the 1974 two-LP set which included &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot;, praised some of the music as &quot;funny, charming, catchy – whimsy at its best. I love most of side one, especially &#x27;Terrapin&#x27; and &#x27;Here I Go,&#x27;&quot; but opined that some of the material was &quot;worthy of the wimp-turned-acid-casualty Barrett is.&quot; Initial sales and reaction were deemed sufficient by EMI to sanction a second solo album.

Upon release, Gilmour said: &quot;Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like. But perhaps we were trying to punish him ...&quot; Barrett stated that &quot;It&#x27;s quite nice but I&#x27;d be very surprised if it did anything. If I were to drop dead, I don&#x27;t think it would stand as my last statement.&quot; Waters was more optimistic, declaring Barrett a &quot;genius&quot;. Malcolm Jones was shocked by what he perceived as the substandard musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs, however: &quot;I felt angry. It&#x27;s like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind ...&quot; Barrett later said of the album: &quot;I liked what came out, only it was released far too long after it was done. I wanted it to be a whole thing that people would listen to all the way through with everything related and balanced, the tempos and moods offsetting each other, and I hope that&#x27;s what it sounds like.&quot; In a bid to increase sales, Jones wrote a letter to music magazine, Melody Maker, under an alternate name, writing how great the album was.

On 6 June 1970, Barrett gave his one and only solo performance, held at the Kensington Olympia, backed by Gilmour and Shirley. They played &quot;Terrapin&quot;, &quot;Gigolo Aunt&quot;, &quot;Effervescing Elephant&quot;, and &quot;Octopus&quot;. From the start of the performance up to (but not including) &quot;Octopus&quot;, the vocals were near-inaudible. Barrett baffled the audience (and Gilmour and Shirley) when he abruptly took off his guitar after the fourth number and walked off stage. The performance has been bootlegged.

===Legacy===

Several notable musicians and bands have listed &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; as one of their favourite albums of all time: they include David Bowie, Genesis P-Orridge, Kavus Torabi, Jennifer Herrema, Viv Albertine, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Hey Colossus, Graham Coxon, Pete Astor, King Buzzo, John Frusciante, Will Hodgkinson, John Maus, and many others.

Many of the songs from the album have been widely covered since its release.

== Cover artwork==
For the album cover, Barrett painted the floor of his bedroom in Wetherby Mansions, orange and purple. with the help of the nude woman appearing on the back of the record sleeve, who was an acquaintance of his, Indian born, of English and Mizo parentage, Evelyn Rose, better known by the misnomers &quot;Iggy the Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Iggy the Inuit&quot;. Photographer Mick Rock says, &quot;When I arrived for &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; photo session, Syd was still in his underpants. His lady friend of two weeks, &#x27;Iggy the Eskimo&#x27;, was naked in the kitchen.&quot; Iggy met Barrett in March 1969, through Barrett&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Jenny Spires. Barrett had moved into Wetherby Mansions, and Jenny took Iggy there one evening. Iggy stayed on at the flat when Jenny left for The States a couple of weeks later. Iggy didn&#x27;t know who Barrett was or that he was previously in Pink Floyd. Iggy heard Barrett play several songs that would later appear on the album, one being &quot;Terrapin&quot;, which she called &quot;quite catchy&quot;. In October 2010 she was interviewed, revealing that her name was Evelyn. The album was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. The original sleeve featured no musician credits, barring producer credit; later issues contain musician credits. On the original release, track 10 is listed as &quot;She Took a Long Cold Look&quot;, although on the 2010 remaster the track is re-titled to &quot;She Took a Long Cool Look&quot;, in similar vein to &quot;An Introduction to Syd Barrett&quot;.

==Reissues==
As part of Harvest Records&#x27;s &quot;Harvest Heritage&quot; series of reissues − and to capitalise on the breakthrough commercial success of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; − &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; was re-released in September 1974 as record one of a double album, record two being Barrett&#x27;s second and last solo album, &quot;Barrett&quot;. (The cover of the double album was also designed by Storm Thorgerson.) In 1993, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; (along with &quot;Barrett&quot; and &quot;Opel&quot;) was reissued both independently and as part of the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; Barrett box set, on 26 April 1993. A remastered version was released in 2010. For release on &quot;An Introduction to Syd Barrett&quot; in 2010, Gilmour laid down a new bass track to &quot;Here I Go&quot;, and remixed &quot;Octopus&quot; and &quot;She Took a Long Cold Look&quot;.

<text>Sunderland Bridge is a bridge just outside the village also called Sunderland Bridge in County Durham, England. It lies close to the confluence of the River Wear and River Browney.

Sunderland Bridge originally carried the Great North Road (A1) across the River Wear, and probably dates back to the 14th century. It is built of dressed sandstone with four semicircular arches. The bridge has undergone several rebuilds, with the end arches being rebuilt in 1770, the parapets widened in 1822, and new end walls built in the 19th century. It is a Grade I listed structure.

When a new bridge was needed as the existing bridge was not wide enough to cope with traffic, Croxdale Bridge was constructed to the east of the existing bridge. The A1 at this point was later re-designated as the A167, and Croxdale Bridge continues to carry this road.

Sunderland Bridge now carries very little road traffic after Durham County Council closed off the old route of the Great North Road at local request. It allows access to the private Croxdale estate and a sewage works. The bridge also forms part of the Weardale Way long-distance footpath. The bridge straddles the parishes of Brandon and Byshottles and Croxdale and Hett.

<text>An agriculture ministry (also called an agriculture department, agriculture board, agriculture council, or agriculture agency, or ministry of rural development) is a ministry charged with agriculture. The ministry is often headed by a minister for agriculture.

Specific duties may relate to regulation, promotion, agricultural research, price supports and agricultural subsidies, plant diseases, invasive species and the management of biosecurity. Some countries have multiple agriculture ministries, devoting entire ministries to be more specific; policy areas such as: forestry and fisheries; rural affairs; food and food quality, security, and safety; consumer protection; and matters relating to the Environment.

<text>&quot;A Song for You&quot; is a song written and originally recorded by rock singer and pianist Leon Russell for his first solo album &quot;Leon Russell&quot;, which was released in 1970 on Shelter Records. A slow, pained plea for forgiveness and understanding from an estranged lover, the tune is one of Russell&#x27;s best-known compositions. Russell sang, played piano, and played tenor horn on the recording. It has been performed and recorded by over 200 artists, spanning many musical genres. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; wrote in 2012: &quot;In 1970 Russell released his self-titled debut solo album, including such enduring songs as &quot;Delta Lady&quot; and &quot;A Song for You&quot;, both written for versatile vocalist Rita Coolidge.

One of the first versions of the song that brought it broader attention was by Andy Williams, whose single peaked at number 29 on the adult contemporary chart and number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1971. Ray Charles recorded a version that earned him the 1994 Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Other notable versions were recorded by the Carpenters in 1972 and Herbie Hancock in 2005.

On January 17, 2018, &quot;A Song for You&quot; was added to Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Notable cover versions==
&quot;A Song for You&quot; has been covered many times since its release. The most notable versions include the following:
*1971 – Andy Williams recorded the song for his covers album, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. His version rose to number 29 on the Easy Listening chart (today&#x27;s Adult Contemporary) in September 1971. At the same time it hit number 82 on the main pop singles chart.
*1971 – Donny Hathaway recorded the song for his second album &quot;Donny Hathaway&quot;, featuring orchestral string and woodwind parts arranged by Arif Mardin. Hathaway&#x27;s producer Jerry Wexler wrote that this version revealed why Mardin was known for the &quot;fastest growing reputation among the new breed of arrangers...&quot; Hathaway&#x27;s gospel-inflected interpretation has been praised as redefining the song as his own. His live performances were electrifying, evoking a near-religious experience for the audience.
*1972 – The Carpenters used the song for the name of their hit album &quot;A Song for You&quot;, and included it as the first track and the last track (in the form of a reprise). The Carpenters took Leon Russell&#x27;s lyrical idea and expanded it to frame their whole album as a concept album. Though the song itself was not released as a single by the Carpenters, they performed it on a Bob Hope television special that aired on October 5, 1972. Their version is considered a standard of adult contemporary music.
*1972 – Peggy Lee recorded the song on her 1972 album &quot;Norma Deloris Egstrom from Jamestown, North Dakota&quot;.
*1972 – Cher recorded the song on her 1972 album &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;.
*1973 – Willie Nelson sang a solo acoustic guitar version for his album &quot;Shotgun Willie&quot;, using his famous guitar Trigger. With this stripped-down arrangement, Nelson brings the greatest degree of intimacy to the song. Nelson also performed the song in the 1980 movie &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, and it appears on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack. 
*1974 – Aretha Franklin recorded a version of the song for her album &quot;Let Me in Your Life&quot;. 
*1975 – The Temptations covered the song on their album &quot;A Song for You&quot;
*1993 – Ray Charles recorded a version of the song on his 1993 album &quot;My World&quot;. Released as a single, it reached number 104 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, and won him a Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. 
*2003 – Willie Nelson, Leon Russell and Ray Charles performed the song at New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre on April 9, 2003, as part of Willie Nelson&#x27;s 70th birthday tribute (released on CD and DVD as &quot;Live and Kickin&#x27;&quot; credited to &quot;Willie Nelson &amp; Friends&quot;). Leon Russell sang the first verse, Willie Nelson sang the second verse, and Charles sang the remainder of the song in this performance. Nelson, who stood nearby during Charles&#x27; performance, was visibly moved.
*2005 – Herbie Hancock featuring Christina Aguilera. This version charted at number 11 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Smooth Jazz Airplay chart in May 2006. It was also nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Hancock and Aguilera performed a live rendition at the ceremony.
*2008 – Bizzy Bone featuring DMX &amp; Chris Notez, rose to number 61 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
*2009 – Whitney Houston recorded an uptempo version of the song for her final studio album &quot;I Look to You&quot;. Houston also performed a slowed-down version of the song in 1991 at her Welcome Home Heroes with Whitney Houston concert. It was reported that Russell was so moved by the performance that he personally wrote her a letter expressing his admiration of her rendition of his song.
*2011 – Amy Winehouse recorded a version from her home that was included on the posthumous &quot;&quot; compilation album. She specifically covered the Donny Hathaway version and references him at the end of the recording.
*2023 - Suzanne Somers sung a version of the song in a video clip at her own memorial. She was 76. According to her husband Alan Hamel, he claims that it was &quot;our song&quot; as &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a dry eye in the room&quot;.

<text>Pannalal Nanalal Patel (7 May 1912 – 6 April 1989) was an Indian author known for his contributions in Gujarati literature. He wrote more than 20 short story collections, such as &quot;Sukhdukhna Sathi&quot; (1940) and &quot;Vatrakne Kanthe&quot; (1952), and more than 20 social novels, such as &quot;Malela Jeev&quot; (1941), &quot;Manvini Bhavai&quot; (1947) and &quot;Bhangyana Bheru&quot; (1957), and several mythological novels. He received the Jnanpith Award in 1985. Some of his works were translated as well as adapted into plays and films.

==Life==
He was born on 7 May 1912 in Mandli village (now in Dungarpur, Rajasthan) to Nanasha a.k.a. Nanalal and Hiraba, an Anjana Chaudhari family. He is youngest among his four siblings. His father was a farmer and used to recite &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Okhaharan&quot; and other mythological stories for his village. This earned his house a nickname &quot;abode of learning&quot;. His father died during his childhood and his mother Hiraba raised the children.
His education progressed with many difficulties due to poverty. He could study up to only the fourth standard at Sir Pratap High School, Idar. During school days, he befriended his schoolmate Umashankar Joshi. For a brief period, he worked as a manager in a liquor manufacturing company in Dungarpur. He wrote his first novel while working as a domestic help in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

In 1936, he accidentally met his old friend Umashankar Joshi who persuaded him to write. He wrote his first short story &quot;Sheth Ni Sharda&quot; (1936). Later, his stories were published in many Gujarati magazines. In 1940, he received recognition for his first novel &quot;Valamana&quot; (The Send-off), followed by &quot;Malela Jeev&quot; (1941), &quot;Manvini Bhavai&quot; (1947) and many other novels. In 1971, he started a publishing company Sadhana in Ahmedabad along with his two sons. During the later years, he mostly wrote novels based on Hindu mythology and epics.

He died on 6 April 1989 in Ahmedabad following brain haemorrhage.

== Works ==
He wrote 61 novels, 26 short story collections and many other works. He wrote his works mostly in the native idioms of Sabarkantha district in north Gujarat.

Love has been central theme of his many novels. He depicted in his works the rural life of Gujarat artificially. His novels are centered around the village, its people, their lives, hopes and aspirations, their problems and predicaments. &quot;Malela Jeev&quot; (1941), a story of unfulfilled love between Kanji and Jivi having been born in different castes, is considered as one of his best novels. His novel &quot;Manvini Bhavai&quot; (1947) is rated as most powerful portrayal of Gujarat&#x27;s rural life and the exploration of rural life during the early 1900s. His novel &quot;Na Chhutke&quot; (1955) is based on Satyagraha movements of Mahatma Gandhi and it enumerates Gandhi&#x27;s various endeavours for freedom of India and spiritual uplifting of Indian people. His other novels depicting rural life are &quot;Bhangyana Bheru&quot; (1957), &quot;Ghammar Valonu&quot; Vol. 1-2 (1968), &quot;Fakiro&quot; (1955), &quot;Manakhavatar&quot; (1961), &quot;Karoliyanu Jalu&quot; (1963), &quot;Meen Matina Manvi&quot; (1966), &quot;Kanku&quot; (1970), &quot;Ajavali Rat Amasni&quot; (1971). His novels depicting urban life are less entertaining than rural life. &quot;Bhiru Sathi&quot; (1943) was his first novel. His other novels depicting urban life are &quot;Yauvan&quot; Vol. 1-2 (1944), &quot;Padagha and Padchhaya&quot; (1960), &quot;Ame Be Baheno&quot; Vol. 1-2 (1962), &quot;Andhi Ashadhni&quot; (1964), &quot;Pranayna Jujva Pot&quot; (1969), &quot;Allad Chhokari&quot; (1972), &quot;Ek Anokhi Preet&quot; (1972), &quot;Nathi Paranya Nathi Kunwara&quot; (1974), &quot;Raw Material&quot; (1983). &quot;Galalsing&quot; (1972) is historical novel of love and valour.

His novels other than theme of love are &quot;Pachhale Barane&quot; (1947), &quot;Vali Vatanma&quot; (1966), &quot;Eklo&quot; (1973), &quot;Taag&quot; (1979), &quot;Pageru&quot; (1981). &quot;Angaro&quot; (1981) is his detective novel. &quot;Param Vaishanav Narasinh Mehta&quot; and &quot;Jene Jivi Janyu&quot; (1984) are his biographical novels of Narsinh Mehta and Ravishankar Maharaj respectively. &quot;Nagadnarayan&quot; (1967) and &quot;Marakatlal&quot; (1973) are his humorous novels.

During his later years, he wrote stories based on characters of epics, &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and Puranas and other Hindu mythological stories. He preserved the original story and its miraculous themes but gave new meanings at several instances. His such works include &quot;Parth ne Kaho Chadave Ban&quot; Vol. 1-5 (1974), &quot;Rame Seetan Marya Jo!&quot; Vol. 1-4 (1976), &quot;Krishna Jivanleela&quot; Vol. 1-5 (1977), &quot;Shivaparvati&quot; Vol. 1-6 (1979), &quot;Bhishmani Banshaiyya&quot; Vol. 1-3 (1980), &quot;Kach-Devyani&quot; (1981), &quot;Devyani-Yayayti&quot; Vol. 1-2 (1982), &quot;Satyabhamano Manushi-Pranaya&quot; (1984), &quot;(Manavdehe) Kamdev Rati&quot; (1984), &quot;(Mahabharatano Pratham Pranay) Bheem-Hidimba&quot; (1984), &quot;Arjunno Vanvas Ke Pranaypravas&quot; (1984), &quot;Pradyamna-Prabhavati&quot; (1984), &quot;Shri Krishnani Aath Pataranio&quot; (1984), &quot;Shikhandi Stree Ke Puraush?&quot; (1984), &quot;Revatighela Baldevji&quot; (1984), &quot;Sahdev-Bhanumatino Pranay&quot; (1984), &quot;Kubja Ane Shri Krishna&quot; (1984), &quot;(Narma Nari) Il-Ila&quot; (1986), &quot;(Amarlok-Mrityuloknu Sahjeevan) Urvashi-Pururava&quot; (1986).

He wrote more than 450 short stories.

<text>Prince Dimitri Zedginidze-Amilakhvari, more commonly known as Dimitri Amilakhvari (, ; 31 October 1906 – 24 October 1942) was a French military officer of noble Georgian descent and Lieutenant Colonel of the French Foreign Legion. Under the nickname &quot;Bazorka&quot;, he became an iconic figure who played an influential role in the Free French Forces fight against the Nazis in World War II.

Strategic Dialogue Format between France and Georgia bears his name.

== Early life and career ==
Amilakhvari was born in Bazorkino (now Chermen, North Ossetia–Alania, Russian Federation), where his family had moved from their ancestral estate at Gori, Georgia during the Russian Revolution of 1905. The house of Zedginidze-Amilakhvari had formerly served as hereditary Master of the Horse to the Georgian Crown (&quot;Amilakhvari&quot;) and retained their princely dignity during the Imperial Russian rule of Georgia. Dimitri&#x27;s grandfather, Ivane Amilakhvari (1829–1905), was an eminent general in the Russian army. His father, Colonel Giorgi Zedginidze-Amilakhvari, also served in the Russian military and transferred his loyalty to the short-lived Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918–1921. After the Russian SFSR occupied Georgia early in 1921, the family fled to Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, where Dimitri attended a local British School, and later, in 1922, emigrated to France.

In 1924, Dimitri Amilakhvari entered the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr and was commissioned as a second lieutenant after his graduation in 1926. At the same time, he was posted to the French Foreign Legion and promoted to lieutenant in 1926. He later served in French North Africa and took part in all important operations in the south of Morocco from 1932 to 1933. From 1934 to 1939, he was Head of the French military school in Agadir, being promoted to captain in 1937. Following his naturalisation as a French citizen, he married another member of the exiled Georgian nobility, Princess Irina, née Dadiani (1904–1944) in August 1927. Note that during his French service,
the spelling of his surname was modified, dropping the &#x27;h&#x27;.

By his wife, Amilakhvari had three children, sons Georges and Othar, and daughter Thamar Amilakhvar, all of whom married and had offspring.

== World War II ==

During the &quot;Phoney War&quot; before the German occupation of France, Amilakhvari was serving in Algiers in North Africa, but in the spring of 1940 he joined the French expeditionary force earmarked for the Norwegian Campaign. He fought at Narvik and was then evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he joined the Free French Forces. He then took part in the unhappy campaigns against the Vichy French forces in West Africa, at Dakar (in Senegal), and Equatorial Africa, in Cameroun. In a remarkable record of service, his war service in 1940 had thus taken him from Africa to the Arctic Circle and back again, as far as the Equator, all in the space of a few months.

Amilakhvari&#x27;s next move took him halfway round the continent to Eritrea, in East Africa, to join the East African Campaign against Italy in early 1941, but by the summer he was on the move again, to take part in another campaign against Vichy France (with units of the French Foreign Legion serving on both sides of the conflict), in Syria. This would be the closest he would come to the land of his birth. Amilakhvari then assumed command of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion on 6 September 1941.

In 1942, Amilakhvari was back in North Africa, facing the German and Italian forces in Libya as part of the North African Campaign. During the hard fighting at Bir-Hakeim (January) he wrote: &quot;We, foreigners, have only one way to prove to France our gratitude: to be killed ...&quot;. Nevertheless, he survived, and in June he was made a Companion of the Liberation, a decoration second only to the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1942 he was also awarded the &quot;Krigskorset med Sverd&quot; or Norwegian War Cross with Sword for his earlier service in Norway. This is Norway&#x27;s highest military decoration for gallantry and he was one of only 66 Frenchmen awarded this decoration during the Second World War.

In October 1942, the Allies began the final offensive in North Africa with the Second Battle of El Alamein. This battle took the Allied forces right across Libya and into French North Africa, where Amilakhvari had begun his operational service. However, Amilakhvari did not live to complete his great African odyssey, as he was killed in action on the second day of the battle.

In May 1940, Amilakhvari was awarded a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour (&quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;). Later, General Charles De Gaulle named him and his legionaries the &quot;Pride of France&quot; for their heroic defence of the Allies&#x27; positions.

<doc id="1205079" wikidata="Q1545344" url="?curid=1205079" title="Mount Stuart House">
<text>Mount Stuart House, on the east coast of the Isle of Bute, Scotland, is a country house built in the Gothic Revival style and the ancestral home of the Marquesses of Bute. It was designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson for the 3rd Marquess in the late 1870s, replacing an earlier house by Alexander McGill, which burnt down in 1877. The house is a Category A listed building.

==Background==
The house is the seat of the Stuarts of Bute, derived from the hereditary office &quot;Steward of Bute&quot; held since 1157. The family are male-line descendants of John Stewart, the illegitimate son of King Robert II of Scotland, the first Stuart King, by his mistress, Moira Leitch. By virtue of this descent, they are also descendants of Robert the Bruce, whose daughter Marjorie was mother of Robert II by her marriage to Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland.

==History==

The original house was built in 1719 for The 2nd Earl of Bute, but was rebuilt for The 3rd Marquess of Bute following a fire on 3 December 1877. After his earlier creations of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch in Cardiff, the Marquess used many of the builders and workman he had employed in South Wales, including William Burges and much of that architect&#x27;s team. Burges built an oratory at the house. The main part of the present house is a flamboyant example of 19th-century Gothic Revival architecture, built in a reddish-brown stone. Mount Stuart&#x27;s major features include the colonnaded Marble Hall at the centre of the main block and the Marble Chapel, which has an elaborate spired tower which is the tallest part of the building. Two earlier wings in a strikingly different style survive. They are much smaller in scale, have Georgian-style sash windows and are painted white.

Much of the furniture was custom-designed for the house by Robert Weir Schultz in the early years of the 20th century. He also laid out many sections of the gardens.

Mount Stuart House claims to have the first ever heated swimming pool to be contained within a house; it was also the first home in Scotland to be lit by electricity. 

The house holds The Bute Collection, a private collection of artwork and artefacts. The Collection also houses archives, books, furniture, and silverwork reflecting the interests of the Bute family&#x27;s various generations, including 25,000 books on topics including theology, botany, agriculture and Scottish history and literature. In April 2016 it was announced that a Shakespeare First Folio had been discovered in the House&#x27;s Library. The folio belonged to Isaac Reed.

The house is open to the public.

<doc id="1205084" wikidata="Q186726" url="?curid=1205084" title="Tetri Giorgi">
<text>Tetri Giorgi (, &quot;White George&quot;) is one of the local names of Christian Saint George in Georgia, specifically in the country&#x27;s northeastern highland districts.

Tetri Giorgi was used as a national symbol, as part of Georgia&#x27;s coat of arms in the years 1918–1921 and 1991–2004. 
The name of Tetri Giorgi has also been adopted by several political and non-political organizations, significantly by an anti-Soviet Georgian émigré group in Europe and a 1990s paramilitary unit.

== History ==
Saint George was venerated in Georgia since Late Antiquity.
The exonym &quot;Georgia&quot; was applied to the country from the 11th or 12th century,
probably by false etymology, but inspired by the great popularity of the saint there.

The cult of &quot;Tetri Giorgi&quot; is associated with the Kakheti region in particular.
It is syncretistic, combining the Christian saint with the cult of a local lunar deity.

A feast day of Tetri Giorgi (&quot;tetrigiorgoba&quot;) separate from the feast day of the Christian saint was once marked annually on 14 August, when many pilgrims from the eastern Georgian provinces attended an overnight feast at the saint&#x27;s chief shrine – a 14th-century church overlooking the village Atsquri in what is now Akhmeta Municipality, Kakheti.

== In heraldry ==
In May 1918, the Democratic Republic of Georgia – newly independent from the Russian Empire – chose the equestrian depiction of Tetri Giorgi as a centerpiece of its coat of arms. But the image was rendered more secular as its Christian symbolism was disfavored by Georgia&#x27;s Social-Democratic government, recalls Revaz Gabashvili, a critic of the contemporary Georgian government. 
In this design, Tetri Giorgi is shown as an armed horseman below a depiction of &quot;the Seven Celestials&quot; (the seven classical planets).

This coat of arms was in use until the Soviet takeover in 1921 and again in post-Soviet Georgia from 1991 to 2004.

<doc id="1205086" wikidata="Q2484481" url="?curid=1205086" title="Minnesota State Highway 5">
<text>Minnesota State Highway 5 (MN 5) is a highway in Minnesota, which runs from its intersection with MN 19 and MN 22 in Gaylord and continues east and northeast to its eastern terminus at its intersection with MN 120 in Maplewood. The route passes through downtown Saint Paul.

==Route description==
State Highway 5 serves as a northeast–southwest route between Gaylord, Norwood Young America, Chanhassen, Eden Prairie, Bloomington, Richfield, downtown Saint Paul, and Maplewood. The State Highway runs though 5 counties. The highway is officially marked as an east–west route by its highway shields from beginning to end.

Part of Highway 5 is designed as a freeway near the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. Just to the west of that segment, Highway 5 runs concurrent with I-494 for between its junction with I-494 near the Airport and the Minnesota River to its junction with I-494 and U.S. 212 in Eden Prairie.

Highway 5 is considered a significant transit corridor, known as the Riverview Corridor, to downtown Saint Paul from the airport and points farther south and west. There has been discussion of creating a bus rapid transit or light rail line along the highway, much like the METRO Blue Line currently runs rails into downtown Minneapolis along State Highway 55.

Highway 5 is also known as &quot;Fort Road&quot; and &quot;West 7th Street&quot; in the city of St. Paul.

 of Highway 5 is officially designated the &quot;Augie Mueller Memorial Highway&quot;. This designation is signed from its intersection with State Highway 101 in Chanhassen southwesterly to its intersection with State Highway 19 in Gaylord.

Legally, State Highway 5 is defined as legislative routes 45, 52, 102, 109, 111, and 121 in the Minnesota Statutes. The route is not marked with those numbers.

==History==
State Highway 5 was authorized in 1934. The route was completely paved by 1953.

When Highway 5 was slated for expansion in 1956, the construction threatened to demolish the remains of historic Fort Snelling, near the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. As a result of public outcry, the highway was built in a short tunnel underneath the Fort Snelling site, sparing the fort from destruction. This effort led to archaeological research into the remains of Fort Snelling and its eventual rebuilding as a state park.

From 1934 to 1982, the eastern section of the highway between Saint Paul and Stillwater was originally marked as &quot;Minnesota 212&quot;, as it once reached old U.S. 212 in Saint Paul, but that segment was re-numbered as an extension of Highway 5 . This segment is still marked with the mileposts from 212, which were a continuation of those from U.S. 212.

In the concurrency with I-494, the MN 5 shield is placed at most, but not all, interchanges. In 2007, new gore signs placed on &quot;France Avenue&quot; in Bloomington at its interchange with I-494 do not mention the Highway 5 concurrency, whereas the older signs they replaced did. The more recent interchange with Lyndale Ave (2009) displays the names of both highways.

In June 2015, it was announced that Highway 5 will be shortened by 8.3 miles by the state of Minnesota, giving the portion from Minnesota 120 to its eastern conterminous at Minnesota 36 to Washington County. The road is known as 34th St. between Jamaca Ave and Highway 120 and Stillwater Blvd. between Jamaca Ave. and Highway 36. The road is an extension of Washington County Roads 14 and 15. This road is designated from the county line to Manning Ave. as County Road 14 and from Manning Ave. to Highway 36 as County Road 15. This piece of the highway that will be returned to the county was originally marked as &quot;Minnesota 212&quot;. This portion of highway is now marked with county highway signs as well as Old Highway 5 signs.

In May 2023, a section of Highway 5 in the vicinity of Chanhassen was designated the Prince Rogers Nelson Memorial Highway in honor of musician Prince, whose Paisley Park Studios are located along the route.

==Major intersections==
All exits are unnumbered except for the I-494 overlap.

<doc id="1205107" wikidata="Q464338" url="?curid=1205107" title="EGL (programming language)">
<text>EGL (Enterprise Generation Language), originally developed by IBM and now available as the EDT (EGL Development Tools) open source project under the Eclipse Public License (EPL), is a programming technology designed to meet the challenges of modern, multi-platform application development by providing a common language and programming model across languages, frameworks, and runtime platforms.

==Overview==
The language borrows concepts familiar to anyone using statically typed languages like Java, COBOL, C, etc. However, it borrows the concept of stereotype from Unified Modeling Language (UML) that is not typically found in statically typed programming languages. In a nutshell, EGL is a higher-level, universal application development language.

EGL is similar in syntax to other common languages so it can be learned by application developers with similar previous programming background. EGL application development abstractions shield programmers from the technical interfaces of systems and middleware allowing them to focus on building business functionality.
EGL applications and services are written, tested and debugged at the EGL source level, and once they are satisfactorily functionally tested they can be compiled into COBOL, Java, or JavaScript code to support deployment of business applications that can run in any of the following environments:

*Platforms with a Java virtual machine, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and UNIX, for example in the context of a Java EE servlet container (IBM WebSphere Application Server, Apache Tomcat, GlassFish)
*IBM System z: CICS Transaction Server, IMS, z/OS Batch, UNIX System Services, WebSphere Application Server, z/VSE, Linux
*IBM Power Systems: IBM i, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Apache Tomcat, Integrated Web Application Server for i
*Web browsers supporting JavaScript, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, for Ajax rich web applications

== Code examples ==

=== Program ===
An EGL Program part is a generatable logic part with one entry point. Each Program part contains a main() function, which represents the logic that runs at program start up. A program can include other functions and can access functions that are outside of the program. The function main() can invoke those other functions. Program functions are composed of a set of EGL statements, variables, and constants.
Program HelloWorld

 const GREETING string = &quot;Hello, &quot;;
 function main()
 myName string = &quot;John&quot;;
 sayHello(myName);
 end

 function sayHello(name String in)
 SysLib.writeStdOut(GREETING + name + &quot;!&quot;);
 end

end
=== Record ===
An EGL Record part defines a set of data elements. In this example, a record with the name CustomerRecord is defined with 6 fields.
Record CustomerRecord type BasicRecord
 customerNumber INT; 
 customerName STRING;
 customerAddr1 STRING;
 customerAddr2 STRING;
 customerAddr3 STRING;
 customerBalance MONEY;
end
EGL has a specialized type of record called SQLRecord that is used to exchange data with a relational database.
record Employee type sqlRecord { tableNames =&quot;Employee&quot;, keyItems =[EMPNO]}
 EMPNUMBER string{ column = &quot;EMPNO&quot;, maxLen = 6};
 FIRSTNME string{ sqlVariableLen = yes, maxLen = 12};
 MIDINIT string{ isSqlNullable = yes, maxLen = 1};
 LASTNAME string{ sqlVariableLen = yes, maxLen = 15};
 DEPT string{ column = &quot;WORKDEPT&quot;, isSqlNullable = yes, maxLen = 3};
 PHONENO string{ isSqlNullable = yes, maxLen = 4};
 HIREDATE date{ isSqlNullable = yes};
end

* In this example, the record Employee is bound to a table (or view) named Employee.

=== Service ===
An EGL Service part contains public functions meant to be accessed from other applications or systems. In this example, a service with two functions is defined.
package com.mycompany.services;

service EmployeeService

 function getEmployees() returns(Employee[])
 records Employee[0]; // define an empty array of records
 get records; // retrieve records from the database
 return (records); // return the records 
 end
 function addEmployee(emp Employee in) returns (boolean)
 try
 add remp;
 return (true);
 onException (ex AnyException)
 return (false);
 end
 end

end
* In EGL, code is organized in packages (like Java (programming language))
* The first function, &quot;getEmployees&quot;, returns an array of records populated from the records in a database.
* The second function, &quot;addEmployee&quot; adds a new record to the database and returns a true or false depending on whether the record was added successfully.

=== RUIHandler ===
The main component of a Rich UI application is a Rich UI handler part. These parts are generated into JavaScript.
package com.mycompany.ui;

import com.mycompany.services.Employee;
import com.mycompany.services.EmployeeService;
import dojo.widgets.DojoGrid;
import dojo.widgets.DojoGridColumn;

handler EmployeeView type RUIhandler { initialUI = [ grid ], 
 onConstructionFunction = start, 
 cssFile = &quot;main.css&quot; }

 grid DojoGrid { behaviors = [ ], headerBehaviors = [ ], columns = [
 new DojoGridColumn { displayName = &quot;First Name&quot;, name = &quot;FIRSTNAME&quot; },
 new DojoGridColumn { displayName = &quot;Last Name&quot;, name = &quot;LASTNAME&quot; },
 new DojoGridColumn { displayName = &quot;Salary&quot;, name = &quot;SALARY&quot; }

 function start()
 svc EmployeeService { };
 call svc.getEmployees () returning to displayEmployees;
 end

 function displayEmployees(retResult Employee [ ] in)
 grid.data = retResult as any [ ];
 end
end
== Web 2.0 with EGL ==
In December 2008, IBM introduced new technology, EGL Rich UI, to simplify the creation of Web 2.0-style rich web applications. This technology simplifies development by hiding the complexities of Ajax, JavaScript, REST, and SOAP from the developer, which enables them to focus on the business requirement and not on the underlying technologies.

== Commercial products ==
EGL programming tools are available as an Eclipse-based commercial product, the Rational Business Developer and also in the EGL edition of Rational Developer for System z.

EGL is a target language for modernization of legacy applications because of the language semantics affinity with procedural languages and legacy 4th generation languages:
* a set of conversion tools available within the Rational Business Developer product provide automated the conversion from older and stabilized IBM and Informix 4th generation languages
* a set of IBM service offerings and complementary products (Rational Migration Extension for Natural, Rational Migration Extension for System i, Rational Migration Extension for CA-products) provide the ability to convert from Software AG Natural, IBM RPG, CA Cool:Gen and CA Ideal/Datacom to EGL

Tools for searching large EGL code bases, comparing individual EGL files for changes, and detecting duplicated code are available from Semantic Designs

<doc id="1205108" wikidata="Q3352071" url="?curid=1205108" title="Omnibus (broadcast)">
<text>An omnibus (or omnibus edition) is a compilation of several television or radio episodes into a single instalment. An omnibus is similar to, but distinct from, what is called a marathon in other countries; In an omnibus, individual episodes are edited together (with the first episode having its closing credits removed, the final episode having the opening credits removed, and each episode in between lacking any credits whatsoever) into a single programme, whereas in a marathon the episodes are aired separately but in sequence. The term has been most frequently used in the United Kingdom, though it has also been used in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. 

&quot;Brookside&quot; was the first television soap to have what was called an omnibus edition, in 1991; it continued until the series ended in 2003. &quot;EastEnders&quot; introduced the equivalent of an omnibus edition starting in the 1980s, but the term &quot;omnibus&quot; was not used until the 1990s.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, many soap operas have been regularly repeated in omnibus format; For example, both &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; air on weekends in an omnibus edition that compiles episodes previously aired during the week. Serials such as &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; and &quot;Dead Set&quot; have been presented as complete storylines in this format.

Omnibus formatting has also been used on home video; for example, the first home video releases of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from BBC Studios Distribution re-formatted each serial into a &quot;feature-length adventure&quot;.

Programmes that are or have been transmitted in omnibus format in the UK include:

Television:
Radio:
* &quot;The Archers&quot; on BBC Radio 4

Internet:
* &quot;&quot; (January 2010 on BBC Red Button and BBC iPlayer; April 2010 – October 2011 on BBC Three)

==Other countries==
* &quot;The Bill&quot; (from 1987 to 1999 on ABC Television (Australia)
* &quot;Coronation Street&quot; on CBC Television (Canada)
* &quot;Shortland Street&quot; on TV2 (New Zealand)
* &quot;Isidingo&quot; on SABC 3 (South Africa)
* &quot;Generations&quot; on SABC 1 (South Africa)
* &quot;7de Laan&quot; on SABC 2 (South Africa)

==United States==
SoapNet in the United States also utilized the omnibus format for weekend re-airings of their major soap operas until its December 2013 demise; however, the term used in that case is as a marathon (the more common term for omnibus used by North American broadcasters) as all five weekday programmes aired by a soap per week were aired consecutively without editing them together. As all four current American soaps also carry their episodes either via Hulu or through network websites, omnibuses and marathons are no longer maintained for the format on any cable or broadcast network.

In the 2006–07 television season, the new network MyNetworkTV launched with four telenovelas, formatted with five episodes airing each weekday (two in the fall, two in the winter), then a &#x27;highlights&#x27;, or &#x27;recap&#x27; omnibus episode on Saturday evenings. However, the entire debut format flopped, and by the time the network started its third cycle of telenovelas, they were reduced to weekly episodes, negating the need for an omnibus episode altogether.

<doc id="1205109" wikidata="Q4876465" url="?curid=1205109" title="Bear Island (novel)">
<text>Bear Island is a thriller novel by Scottish author Alistair MacLean. Originally published in 1971 with a cover by Norman Weaver, it was the last of MacLean&#x27;s novels to be written in first-person narrative. This novel is a murder mystery with the added twist that the scene of the crimes is Bear Island, an island in the Svalbard archipelago of the Norwegian Arctic.

==Plot summary==
A converted fishing trawler, &quot;Morning Rose&quot; carries a movie-making crew across the Barents Sea to isolated Bear Island, well above the Arctic Circle, for some on-location filming, but the script is a secret known only to the producer and screenwriter. En route, members of the movie crew and ship&#x27;s company begin to die under mysterious circumstances. The crew&#x27;s doctor, Marlowe, finds himself enmeshed in a violent, multi-layered plot in which very few of the persons aboard are who they claim to be. Marlowe&#x27;s efforts to unravel the plot become even more complicated once the movie crew is deposited ashore on Bear Island, beyond the reach of the law or outside help. The murders continue ashore, and Marlowe, who is not what he seems to be either, discovers they may be related to some forgotten events of the Second World War.

==Reception==
The &quot;Observer&quot; called it &quot;highly impossible, highly readable.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the best adventure MacLean has written for some time. It will make a whopping good movie.&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

The novel sold over 8 million copies. &quot;Bear Island&quot; was adapted to film in the 1979 movie directed by Don Sharp and starred Donald Sutherland, Richard Widmark, Vanessa Redgrave, and Christopher Lee. The film was shot in Canada and Alaska, and the scenery bears little resemblance to Bear Island. Furthermore, the plot and characterization of the novel were greatly altered by the scriptwriters, to the point of changing the name of the protagonist from &quot;Marlowe&quot; to &quot;Lansing&quot;.

<doc id="1205110" wikidata="Q477833" url="?curid=1205110" title="Mauritius national football team">
<text>The Mauritius national football team (), nicknamed Club M and Les Dodos (The Dodos), is the national team of Mauritius. They are overseen by the Mauritius Football Association, which is a member of FIFA, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA). The head coach is Guillaume Moullec.

Their most significant achievements are qualification for the 1974 African Cup of Nations, and winning the Indian Ocean Island Games football tournament in 1985 and 2003. They have also been a finalist in this competition in 1990, 2011 and 2019.

==History==

===Early years===
Mauritius played its first competitive international game in 1947 against Réunion, which they won 2–1. For the next twenty years, they would only play Réunion and Madagascar (probably due to the proximity of the three islands to each other) in friendlies and the Indian Ocean Games Triangulaire, which existed from 1947 to 1963. Mauritius won the competition ten times over that time period, were runners-up twice, and came in third once.

=== 1960s–1990s ===
Starting in 1967, Mauritius began competing against other countries, playing friendlies and entering in such competitions as the Africa Cup of Nations and the FIFA World Cup qualifiers, though they haven&#x27;t found much success. While they have never qualified for the World Cup finals, they have qualified once for the Africa Cup of Nations, in 1974, however, they were eliminated in the group stages. Mauritius did manage to win the resurrected Indian Ocean Games in 1985. In 1999, after deadly riots caused by supporters of Scouts Club (renamed as Port Louis Sporting Club) angry about a controversial penalty awarded to Fire Brigade Sports Club (now renamed as Pamplemousses SC&lt;ref name=&quot;Mauritius 2000/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) in the championship deciding game, which gave Fire Brigade a 1–0 win, all domestic football was suspended for 18 months, and only the national team was allowed to play. This is regarded as the point at which Mauritian football, both on the domestic and international stage, started on a downward slope.

=== 2000s–present ===

Throughout the new millennium, the national team&#x27;s performances progressively declined. From a high of the 116th place in the FIFA rankings in 2000, they tumbled down to an all-time low of the 195th place in the summer of 2011. 

A peak was reached in 2003, when Mauritius convincingly won the 2003 Indian Ocean Island Games, on home soil, under head coach Akbar Patel. They followed up with a 3-1 home win over Uganda in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualification (CAF) first round in November 2003, although Uganda progressed on aggregate. Mauritius then reached the quarterfinals of the 2004 COSAFA Cup, beating South Africa 2–0 in January 2004. Mauritius eventually lost out 3–1 to the tournament&#x27;s favorites Zambia. In the next few years, the team would go through a slump in performance, suffering their biggest defeats in the process and recording few official wins. Mauritius have also cycled through many head coaches, especially since the new millennium, but none have had true success. 

During the 2017 African Cup of Nations qualifiers, &quot;Les Dodos&quot; achieved their best results in a decade, defeating both Mozambique and Rwanda. However, they were unable to build on these wins, losing to Comoros and then São Tomé and Príncipe in the preliminary round of the next two editions. In the 2023 AFCoN qualifiers, Mauritius faced São Tomé again in the preliminary round and lost 1–0 in the first leg and drew 3–3 at home, failing to progress. Following the result, CAF ruled that one of the São Tomé players was not eligible, awarding Mauritius a 3–0 victory and sending them into the group stages for the first time since 2017. However, this decision was reversed, following an appeal by São Tomé. 

In 2023, Mauritius recorded impressive wins vs Kenya (1-0), who were in the FIFA rankings&#x27; top 100, and Angola (1-0; 0-0). However, in the 2025 AFCoN qualifiers, Mauritius lost to Chad in the preliminary round, marking four consecutive unsuccessful attempts to reach the group stage of the qualification round.

<text>Drastamat Kanayan (; 31 May 1884 8 March 1956), better known as Dro (), was an Armenian military commander and politician. He was a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. He briefly served as Defence Minister of the First Republic of Armenia in 1920, during the country&#x27;s brief independence. During World War II, he led the Armenian Legion, which consisted of Armenian POWs who opted to fight for Nazi Germany rather than face the brutal conditions of the Nazis&#x27; camps.

==Early life==
Drastamat Kanayan was born in Igdyr (present-day Iğdır, Turkey) in the Surmalu uezd of the Russian Empire in 1884. He was the son of Martiros Kanayan, the head of the Kanayan clan in Igdir, and his wife, Horom. At an early age, Martiros enrolled his son to the parish school of Igdir. Drastamat would skip school, preferring to visit the military barracks of Igdir because of his interest in its military exercises. Igdir at the time was an important military post where between 8,000 and 10,000 Russian troops were stationed (including infantry, Cossacks, cavalry and border guards). Most of the inhabitants of the village thrived by trading with the soldiers. Noticing that his son had no interest in books and learning, Martiros pulled him out of the village school and enrolled him to the Yerevan Gymnasium school.

Drastamat was no better in the Gymnasium school as the grades he achieved were barely enough for a promotion. Like all government schools in the provinces of Russia, there was a policy of Russification that limited education in the Armenian language to religion only. Inspired by stories of General Andranik&#x27;s triumphs in the Ottoman Empire and the spread of nationalism by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), Drastamat joined a secret youth movement in his school that opposed the tsar&#x27;s government and promoted Armenian nationalism.

===Edict on Armenian church property and Armenian-Tatar clashes===
On 12 June 1903, the tsarist authorities passed an edict to bring all Armenian Church property under imperial control. This was faced by strong Armenian opposition because it perceived the tsarist edict as a threat to the Armenian national existence. As a result, the Armenian leadership decided to actively defend Armenian churches by dispatching militiamen who acted as guards and holding mass demonstrations. This prompted Drastamat to join the ranks of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation in order to defend churches from confiscation through public demonstrations and guard duty. In May 1905, using a bomb he carried out the assassination of the governor of Baku, Prince Mikhail Nakashidze, whom the ARF blamed for inciting Tatar attacks against Armenians in Baku. During the Armenian–Tatar clashes of 1905–1907, Dro participated in the organization of Armenian defense militias in the regions of Kotayk, Nakhijevan, and Zangezur. In 1907, Dro assassinated Tsarist general Maksud Alikhanov in Alexandropol. Prior to the Russian Revolution, Dro had killed more than one Russian official.

==World War I==

He served as detachment commander in the Russian Caucasus Army during World War I. He was one of the commanders of the Armenian volunteer units and was decorated by the Tsar.

In November 1914, he commanded the second battalion of the Armenian volunteers. The second battalion of the Armenian volunteers engaged in battle for the first time near Bayazid during the Bergmann Offensive. In the course of a bloody combat which lasted twenty-four hours, Dro, commander of the battalion, was seriously wounded. From that day to March of the following year, he remained in critical condition, but his battalion participated in eleven battles near Alashkert and Tutak, until Dro recovered and returned to resume the command. Kanayan had already become a popular military leader after the victories over the Ottoman Empire at the Caucasus Campaign.

Between March 1918 and April 1918 he was appointed by the Armenian National Council military commissar to the occupation of Turkish Armenia of the Ararat region. He was the commander of the Armenian forces in the Battle of Bash Abaran. The Armenian victories at Bash Abaran, Karakilisa, and Sardarabad stopped the advance of the Ottoman Army and are credited with preventing the destruction of the Armenian nation and allowing the creation of the First Republic of Armenia.

==First Republic of Armenia==
Dro was one of the chief military commanders of the First Republic of Armenia. He commanded Armenian forces during the brief Armeno-Georgian War in December 1918 over the disputed Borchaly (Lori) and Akhalkalaki &quot;uezds&quot; (&quot;counties&quot;).

===Armenian–Azerbaijani War===

During much of 1919, Dro and his army fought Ottoman-backed insurrections by Muslims against the First Republic of Armenia, defending the area south of Yerevan in what is now Ararat Province of Armenia. In December 1919, Dro went to Goris with a force of 600 soldiers with the intention of establishing Armenian control over the Syunik and Nagorno-Karabakh regions, which were fiercely disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In a short amount of time, Dro, along with Garegin Nzhdeh and other commanders, drove out the Azerbaijani army and expelled most of the Turkic-speaking Muslims from Syunik, solidifying Armenian control over the region.

On the night from 21–22 March 1920, when the Azerbaijanis were celebrating Novruz Bayram, the Armenians of Artsakh revolted and organized a surprise attack. During these clashes thousands of people from both the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides were killed, with more than 7,000 houses burned and Shushi virtually cleansed of its Armenian population. Dro, who had not expected the Armenian uprising, arrived in Artsakh only in April, when many Armenian villages had already been destroyed by the Azerbaijani army.

On 27 April 1920, the Red Army invaded Azerbaijan and established a Soviet government there. The leadership of the Red Army demanded that Dro and his army leave Artsakh and Syunik. Dro knew that if he did not comply with this demand the Red Army and the armed forces of Azerbaijan would act jointly against Armenia and the Armenians of Artsakh. Dro withdrew from Artsakh after he was given assurances by the emissaries of Bolshevik leader Sergo Ordzhonikidze regarding a just solution to the Artsakh conflict. On 26 May 1920, the 10th Congress of the Armenian National Council of Karabakh, which took place in Taghavard village, proclaimed the establishment of Soviet power in Artsakh. The Armenian National Council of Artsakh was replaced with the Revolutionary Committee of Nagorno-Artsakh, headed by Sargis Hambardzumyan. That same day, Kanayan left Artsakh with his units and withdrew to Syunik.

In the July 1920, Dro and Minister of Defence Ruben Ter Minasian led a campaign against Ottoman-backed Muslim rebels supported by Azerbaijan in the Vedibasar and Zangibasar districts (around modern-day Vedi and Masis, respectively), resettling Armenian refugees in the abandoned Muslim villages.

In August 1920, Dro&#x27;s forces engaged in skirmishes with the Red Army, which made attempts to advance into Syunik. Despite some initial success, Dro was forced to leave Goris to the Red Army and withdraw to Daralayaz (modern-day Vayots Dzor).

=== Turkish–Armenian War and Sovietization of Armenia ===

On 24 September 1920, Kâzım Karabekir&#x27;s army invaded Armenia. Dro commanded the defence of his native district Surmalu. Although Dro successfully defended Surmalu, the fall of Kars and the further advance of Karabekir&#x27;s army forced Dro&#x27;s army to retreat to the other side of the Arax River into modern-day Armenia on November 12.

From 24 November to 2 December 1920, Kanayan was the Defence Minister of Armenia. On 30 November 1920, Soviet Russia issued an ultimatum to the leadership of Armenia to peacefully hand over power to a Soviet government. Dro was authorized to negotiate with Soviet representative Boris Legran about the conditions of the transfer of power. Dro ordered the Armenian army not to show resistance against the Red Army if it advanced into Armenia. He was one of the signatories of the declaration of the transfer of power to a Soviet government made by the government of Armenia on 2 December 1920, which also declared Dro de facto leader of Armenia pending the arrival of the Revolutionary Committee of Armenia to Yerevan.

Dro remained in the country and remained commander of Soviet Armenia&#x27;s army until January 1921, when he was exiled to Russia along with 1,200 Armenian officers. He stayed in Moscow until 1923, and traveled in Europe before finally settling in Bucharest, Romania in 1925. Dro&#x27;s second wife, Arpenik (whom he married in 1915), and their two children were sent into internal exile in Siberia and remained separated from him for the rest of his life.

==World War II==

During World War II, Dro was one of several members of the ARF who, without approval from the party leadership, entered negotiations with Nazi Germany with the hope of freeing Armenia of Soviet control in the event of Germany&#x27;s victory over the Soviet Union. The Armenian Legion was formed from Armenian POWs in the Nazi POW camps who opted to fight for Germany rather than face the brutal conditions of the camps. The Legion was placed under Dro&#x27;s command. The Legion was trained by Wehrmacht officers and participated in the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and the Caucasus.

With the end of World War II, Drastamat Kanayan was arrested by American forces in Heidelberg, but soon released. After World War II, Kanayan emigrated to the United States and continued his political activities. In 1947, at the World Congress of the ARF, he was forgiven for his collaboration with Nazis and was again elected a member of the party.

==Death, burial, and legacy==
Dro settled with the large Armenian community in Beirut, where he lived for several years with the former prime minister of the First Republic of Armenia, Simon Vratsian. He returned to the United States several times for medical treatment. Dro died in Boston, Massachusetts while there for medical treatment on 8 March 1956 and was buried there. He was survived by his third wife Gayane (whom he married in Bucharest in 1935), their son Mardiros (Martin) and Dro&#x27;s stepdaughter Olga. His remains were taken to Armenia for final burial in Aparan, on 28 May 2000, coinciding with the commemoration of the 82nd anniversary of the First Republic of Armenia.

In 2001, the Ministry of Defence of Armenia established the Drastamat Kanayan medal, which is awarded to military personnel and civilians who excel in military instruction. In 2005, the government of Armenia founded the Drastamat Kanayan Institute for National Strategic Studies, which in 2016 became a part of the National Institute of Strategic Studies under the Ministry of Defence. A street in the Kanaker-Zeytun District of Yerevan is named after Dro.

<text>In quantum physics, Regge theory ( , ) is the study of the analytic properties of scattering as a function of angular momentum, where the angular momentum is not restricted to be an integer multiple of &quot;ħ&quot; but is allowed to take any complex value. The nonrelativistic theory was developed by Tullio Regge in 1959.

==Details==

The simplest example of Regge poles is provided by the quantum mechanical treatment of the Coulomb potential formula_1 or, phrased differently, by the quantum mechanical treatment of the binding or scattering of an electron of mass formula_2 and electric charge formula_3 off a proton of mass formula_4 and charge formula_5. The energy formula_6 of the binding of the electron to the proton is negative whereas for scattering the energy is positive. The formula for the binding energy is the expression
:formula_7 
where formula_8, formula_9 is the Planck constant, and formula_10 is the permittivity of the vacuum. The principal quantum number formula_11 is in quantum mechanics (by solution of the radial Schrödinger equation) found to be given by formula_12, where formula_13 is the radial quantum number and formula_14 the quantum number of the orbital angular momentum. Solving the above equation for formula_15, one obtains the equation 
:formula_16
Considered as a complex function of formula_6 this expression describes in the complex formula_15-plane a path which is called a Regge trajectory. Thus in this consideration the orbital
momentum can assume complex values.

Regge trajectories can be obtained for many other potentials, in particular also for the Yukawa potential.

Regge trajectories appear as poles of the scattering amplitude or in the related formula_19-matrix. In the case of the Coulomb potential considered above this formula_19-matrix is given by the following expression as can be checked by reference to any textbook on quantum mechanics:
:formula_21
where formula_22 is the gamma function, a generalization of factorial formula_23. This gamma function is a meromorphic function of its argument with simple poles at formula_24. Thus the expression for formula_19 (the gamma function in the numerator) possesses poles at precisely those points which are given by the above expression for the Regge trajectories; hence the name Regge poles.

==History and implications==

The main result of the theory is that the scattering amplitude for potential scattering grows as a function of the cosine formula_26 of the scattering angle as a power that changes as the scattering energy changes:
:formula_27
where formula_28 is the noninteger value of the angular momentum of a would-be bound state with energy formula_6. It is determined by solving the radial Schrödinger equation and it smoothly interpolates the energy of wavefunctions with different angular momentum but with the same radial excitation number. The trajectory function is a function of formula_30 for relativistic generalization. The expression formula_31 is known as the Regge trajectory function, and when it is an integer, the particles form an actual bound state with this angular momentum. The asymptotic form applies when formula_26 is much greater than one, which is not a physical limit in nonrelativistic scattering.

Shortly afterwards, Stanley Mandelstam noted that in relativity the purely formal limit of formula_26 large is near to a physical limit — the limit of large formula_34. Large formula_34 means large energy in the crossed channel, where one of the incoming particles has an energy momentum that makes it an energetic outgoing antiparticle. This observation turned Regge theory from a mathematical curiosity into a physical theory: it demands that the function that determines the falloff rate of the scattering amplitude for particle-particle scattering at large energies is the same as the function that determines the bound state energies for a particle-antiparticle system as a function of angular momentum.

The switch required swapping the Mandelstam variable formula_36, which is the square of the energy, for formula_34, which is the squared momentum transfer, which for elastic soft collisions of identical particles is s times one minus the cosine of the scattering angle. The relation in the crossed channel becomes
:formula_38

which says that the amplitude has a different power law falloff as a function of energy at different corresponding angles, where corresponding angles are those with the same value of formula_34. It predicts that the function that determines the power law is the same function that interpolates the energies where the resonances appear. The range of angles where scattering can be productively described by Regge theory shrinks into a narrow cone around the beam-line at large energies.

In 1960 Geoffrey Chew and Steven Frautschi conjectured from limited data that the strongly interacting particles had a very simple dependence of the squared-mass on the angular momentum: the particles fall into families where the Regge trajectory functions were straight lines: formula_40 with the same constant formula_41 for all the trajectories. The straight-line Regge trajectories were later understood as arising from massless endpoints on rotating relativistic strings. Since a Regge description implied that the particles were bound states, Chew and Frautschi concluded that none of the strongly interacting particles were elementary.

Experimentally, the near-beam behavior of scattering did fall off with angle as explained by Regge theory, leading many to accept that the particles in the strong interactions were composite. Much of the scattering was &quot;diffractive&quot;, meaning that the particles hardly scatter at all — staying close to the beam line after the collision. Vladimir Gribov noted that the Froissart bound combined with the assumption of maximum possible scattering implied there was a Regge trajectory that would lead to logarithmically rising cross sections, a trajectory nowadays known as the pomeron. He went on to formulate a quantitative perturbation theory for near beam line scattering dominated by multi-pomeron exchange.

From the fundamental observation that hadrons are composite, there grew two points of view. Some correctly advocated that there were elementary particles, nowadays called quarks and gluons, which made a quantum field theory in which the hadrons were bound states. Others also correctly believed that it was possible to formulate a theory without elementary particles — where all the particles were bound states lying on Regge trajectories and scatter self-consistently. This was called &quot;S&quot;-matrix theory.

The most successful &quot;S&quot;-matrix approach centered on the narrow-resonance approximation, the idea that there is a consistent expansion starting from stable particles on straight-line Regge trajectories. After many false starts, Richard Dolen, David Horn, and Christoph Schmid understood a crucial property that led Gabriele Veneziano to formulate a self-consistent scattering amplitude, the first string theory. Mandelstam noted that the limit where the Regge trajectories are straight is also the limit where the lifetime of the states is long.

As a fundamental theory of strong interactions at high energies, Regge theory enjoyed a period of interest in the 1960s, but it was largely succeeded by quantum chromodynamics. As a phenomenological theory, it is still an indispensable tool for understanding near-beam line scattering and scattering at very large energies. Modern research focuses both on the connection to perturbation theory and to string theory.

<text>The Armeno-Georgian War was a short border dispute that was fought in December 1918 between the newly independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of the Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly (Lori) and Akhalkalaki.

In May 1918, towards the end of World War I, Armenia and Georgia both declared their independence, dissolving the short-lived union between them. Both Georgia and Armenia claimed Lori and Akhalkalaki, both of which were populated primarily by Armenians. The border dispute turned into an open military conflict on 7 December 1918. Armenian forces initiated coup de mains that brought them within 10 kilometers of the Georgian capital, Tiflis, before Georgian troops were able to organize counterattacks. Allied intervention forced a ceasefire. Battles continued until the ceasefire came into effect at midnight on December 31.

A neutral zone, under Allied supervision, was declared in the Borchaly district, which would later be split in between the two states. The large Armenian population of Tiflis and other Georgian-controlled regions was subject to mass arrests and other forms of persecution both during and after the war. Armenia did not succeed in the nearly-obtained original goal of gaining land up to the Khrami River, and the entire war took place on land that had been controlled prior by Georgia. The result of the war is considered inconclusive, with the Armenian side declaring a successful liberation of Armenian territories and the Georgian side declaring a successful defense against an invasion.

==Background==
===Russian Revolution===

After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government installed the Special Transcaucasian Committee to govern the area. However, after the October Revolution, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was replaced on 11 November 1917 by the Transcaucasian Commissariat, centred in Tbilisi. The Commissariat concluded the Armistice of Erzincan with the Ottoman Empire on 5 December 1917, which ended a localised armed conflict with the Ottoman Empire. The Commissariat actively sought to suppress Bolshevik influence and meanwhile to pursue a path towards Transcaucasian independence from Soviet Russia. That included establishing a legislative body, the Transcaucasian Sejm, to which the Commissariat surrendered its authority on 23 January 1918 after the dispersal of the Russian Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks. The secessionist and anti-Bolshevik agenda eventually brought Transcaucasian Sejm into conflict with the central government. On 3 March, the Russians signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, marking Russia&#x27;s exit from World War I. In the treaty, Russia agreed to return territory gained during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, despite the fact that the territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces. The Trebizond Peace Conference between the Ottoman Empire and the Sejm began on 4 March and continued until April. The Ottomans offered to surrender all of their ambitions in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the re-acquisition of the eastern Anatolian provinces awarded at Brest-Litovsk.
By then, leading Georgian politicians viewed an alliance with Germany as the only way to prevent Georgia from being occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Consequently, the National Council of Georgia declared the independence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia on 26 May and, two days later, signed the Treaty of Poti with Germany to place itself under German protection. The following day, the Muslim National Council announced the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Having been largely abandoned by its allies, the Armenian National Council declared independence on May 28. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasusian states, which brought the conflict with the Ottoman Empire to an end. The treaty awarded the southern half of the ethnically Armenian Lori subdistrict () and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans, but it did not firmly delineate the borders between the new Transcaucasus states. In order to deny the Ottomans a direct route to Tbilisi, Georgian units, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established outposts along the Dzoraget River. The Georgian prime minister Noe Zhordania assured the Armenian National Council that the occupation was a temporary measure. However, in a subsequent meeting Georgian representatives laid claim to all of the districts of the Tiflis Governorate, as well as the Pambak subdistrict of the Erivan Governorate, eliciting protests from the Armenian side.

===Initial clashes===

In early October 1918, the Ottomans pulled back from southern Lori, which eliminated the territorial buffer between Armenia and Georgia. The Armenian military quickly filled the void by taking control of much of southern Lori on 18 October and, in the absence of any resistance, probed further north. The first incident between Armenia and Georgia occurred the same day, when an Armenian army detachment seized the railway station in the village of Kober, near modern-day Tumanyan, and refused a subsequent demand from the Germans to withdraw. Another village, Korinj, was also seized. The Armenians withdrew when Georgia sent a detachment to confront them, but they later returned to Korinj and occupied Tsater. Armenia&#x27;s ambassador to Tbilisi, Arshak Djamalian, insisted that Armenian claims over Lori were indisputable, but that his government wished to pursue its claims solely by diplomatic means. the Armenian parliament sent a message to its Georgian counterpart declaring calling for an amicable solution &quot;in the name of the centuries-long brotherly relations of the two peoples&quot;. The Georgian government agreed with a peaceful settlement in principle. However, Armenian troops had to leave recently occupied villages, and further operations within the Tiflis Governorate would be considered an act of war. The commander of the German military expedition reminded Djamalian that Germany was obliged to defend its protectorate. On October 24 the Georgian government declared martial law in Lori, deployed General Tsulukidze and ordered him to deal with armed formations behind Georgian lines. He was, however, instructed to avoid direct confrontation with the Armenian troops, who were occupying Korinj and Tsater. On October 26 the invading Armenian forces were ordered to return and left the two villages amid the deployment of a Georgian contingent in the area.

In November and early December, the Armenians of Lori protested that Georgian troops, under the guise of &quot;conducting investigations&quot;, robbed food and supplies from the homes of Armenian peasants and molested women. Georgian troops were accused of similar crimes at Akhalkalaki. The historian Christopher J. Walker compared the Georgian occupation of Lori to a &quot;tsarist-style military bureaucracy&quot;. The historian Leo wrote:

The Armenian government made attempts to solve the dispute diplomatically on 9 and 12 December, which terms the Georgian government rejected. On 12 December, Armenian Prime Minister Hovhannes Kajaznuni sent the following message to his Georgian counterpart Noe Zhordania:

Georgia had begun to prevent railroads from transporting foreign supplies into Armenia, which resulted in famine.

=== Lori region ===
Armenian-American historian Richard G. Hovannisian in his book &quot;The Republic of Armenia&quot; describes the political history of the region of Lori:

==War==

===Order of Battle===
====Armenia====
To Armenia, the primary regional threat were the Ottoman Empire and other Turkic factions. For them, an Ottoman breakthrough at the Caucasian Front was equalled with the demise of the Armenian nation. Therein and the fear of foreign incursions was the basis of creating a national military corps, even before gaining independence in 1918. Such a proposal was approved on 11 July 1917 by the provisional government and High Command. The planned Armenian corps was structured not too differently to their later Georgian counterpart, also partially inspired by Russian military doctrines and organisation. Plans were already made in 1917 and roots lied in the Armenian units that had fought for the Russian Empire since 1914. The largest of those (1,500 men strong) was led by Andranik. In 1917 some 80,000 Armenians were serving in the ranks of the Imperial Russian Army. Nearly as many in the Caucasus. In the TDFR, the corps was to consist of two infantry divisions, one &quot;special division&quot;, one artillery division, one cavalry brigade and an engineer regiment, supplemented by six separate regiments deployed to different areas, including the Tiflis Governorate. One to be assigned for the protection of railroads. The special division was to draw manpower from Armenians who fled the Ottoman Empire. According to leaderships plans, each division would be made up of four infantry regiments with their own artillery and cavalry detachments. The cavalry brigade was to consist of two cavalry regiments and two artillery batteries. In addition several reserve units would be requested and some formed. Implemented, the Armenian army would have been of substantial size. Ultimately, the Armenians succeeded in creating an overall larger fighting force. On 1 January 1918, the Armenian Army comprised about 40,000 personnel and consisted of two rifle divisions, three volunteer brigades, one cavalry brigade and several militia battalions. Their main cadres were formed from people who had served in the period of 1914–1916. The formations were well equipped with machine guns, but lacking in artillery due to shortcomings of experienced and trained personnel in that particular area. The rifle divisions were each equipped with six heavy artillery batteries, while light guns were transferred to the volunteer forces. According to Denikin, during the summer of 1918, peacetime strength was at 22,000 men and more than 44,000 troops could be mustered in wartime. However those numbers fluctuated heavily and were more likely in the scale of 10,000–15,000. While Jones mentions three Armenian divisions by end of January and their disposition in detail. A problematic factor were ongoing conflicts like with Azerbaijan, that drew thousand of bodies in manpower, away from the mainland.

By June 1918, after establishing independence, the Armenian army at the time numbered some 12,000 men and gradually grew to 40,000. Its officer corps consisted of Armenians as well as Russians. However Allen and Muratoff note that the Armenian forces became weaker and less effective. Their 24 rifle and eight volunteer battalions didn&#x27;t exceed 16,000 riflemen, 1,000 cavalrymen and 4,000 militia. Battalion sizes ranged from 400 to 600. Because of the Treaty of Batum, the size of the Armenian corps was further reduced by the end of July 1918, to only one division. This restriction however did not touch separate formations not integrated in the corps and subordinated to the government, such as the volunteer brigade led by Andronik.
Despite those setbacks, Armenia was able to create a fully structured corps, beating Georgia to it by many months and into the upcoming war.

====Georgia====
From Georgian perspective, North-Eastern and Eastern advances of the Ottoman forces constituted an imminent threat not only to Akhaltsikhe and Akhalkalaki, but also to Tiflis. During its brief independence, Russia and Turkey remained the main threats to the Republic. In a session on May 25, 1918, the Menshevik government decided that all laws and resolutions established during the short-lived TDFR, would temporarily carry over to the newly formed Republic. Batumi was declared occupied. In June a Georgian army deployed to Abkhazia at request of the Abkhaz Council in order to quell Bolshevik revolts and in the process, took Sochi as well as Tuapse from the Red Army. By the time the Sochi conflict escalated, Georgia was effectively subjected to aggression by both Russian bolsheviks and the Ottoman Empire, which lasted until 1919. The ambitions of those two prompted creation of a cohesive armed force. A draft, which laid out the organisation structure, was presented by General Kvinitadze on 2 June 1918. Three days later on 5 June, official enlistment began on the basis of that new institution. At the time, only able bodies from the ages of 19 to 23 were allowed to serve. By June its German protector sent troops to aid in the training. The memoires of German general von Kressenstein speak of a stubborn Georgian government, that initially refused the implementation of a regular army accordingly to their demands. Pressure forced them to concede to a model with conscription. The governments original intention was to form two infantry divisions, one Border Guard division, three cavalry regiments and an artillery brigade, leaning towards Red Army structures. The peacetime strength was to be 30–40,000 soldiers. Kvinitadze wanted to create three divisions, so that one could at least defend against potential Ottoman thrusts towards and from the direction of Batumi, Artvin, Ardahan and Akhaltsikhe. Disagreement between German and Georgian officers delayed approval of a German inspired model until 20 August 1918. The first regular army, as per new law, was to consist of two infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, one artillery brigade, one support company, one engineer company, one motorized company, one armored company and a fighter group. However it never reached the envisioned size or quality at any time in the First Republics existence. By November 1918, the Georgian military&#x27;s manpower shortage lied at around 60%, while the army still lacked 80% of the required horses. Despite being in a terrible state, Georgian troops with the assistance of the People&#x27;s Guard, managed to stall and fend off further Ottoman and Bolshevik incursions.

Throughout 1918, the majority of Georgian forces consisted of militia type formations and only in critical events, such as the Armeno-Georgian war, a large ad-hoc force would be assembled to respond. Vital instruments, such as military intelligence, were lacking almost completely. Existing People&#x27;s Guard (also called Workers Guard) units were plagued by disorganisation and ill discipline, sometimes even disobedience. They were often accused of irresponsible behaviour and were being reformed. Its personnel were made up of ideology driven Menshevik party members and the Guard at large, wasn&#x27;t a cohesive fighting force. It comprised territorial battalions that would be consolidated and assigned competent military leadership, only in the case of war. The relationship between Guard and regular army was described as &quot;not ideal&quot;. The Guard enjoyed greater privileges and was heavily politicized, as de facto protector and &quot;sword&quot; of the Menshevik government. While the regular army was subordinated to the Defence Ministry, the entirety of the Guard was directly controlled by the Menshevik dominated parliament. The 2nd Division of the regular army completed its muster not earlier than the end of December 1918, when the war was in its final days. The cavalry brigade failed to form at all. Citations from officers often included remarks of poor quality in the majority rank and file, who were only called in for several days, when rewarding the few stand outs who committed commendable action. Exceptions were the 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments of the 1st Division, that enjoyed superior level of organisation.

===Unrest in Lori===
Following the Turkish retreat from southern Lori in October 1918, Armenian forces gained control of the region, resulting in a border between Armenia and Georgia. In response, the Georgian side bolstered it&#x27;s garrison in the northern parts. The local populace was required to provide quarters and supplies for Georgian troops and became subject to searches and undisciplined behaviour by the soldiers. In Uzunlar, the Armenian peasantry resisted the excessive search operations. In response, Georgian troops beat the village commissar and killed an official. A Georgian military investigation confirmed the Georgian soldiers had been the instigators and requested replacement of troops, but concluded that due to the organised nature of resistance, Uzunlar was to be searched and neutralized.

By early December, rebellion seemed imminent in northern Lori. Armenian emissaries from Uzunlar traveled to the Georgian headquarters near Sanahin to protest the violence. General Tsulukidze had the emissaries arrested and sent a detachment to deal with the unrests. His troops were reportedly attacked, while the Armenians of Uzunlar claimed their village was bombarded for two days, while the Georgians claimed the villagers had opened fire. According to Tsulikidze, Armenian troops of the 4th Infantry Regiment operating in disguise were instigating an insurrection. They had disarmed a cavalry unit and the garrison at Uzunlar. Subsequently, a relief force was met with a barrage of fire. The following day an Armenian force of 350 men attacked two Georgian units and partisans crushed several soldiers by boulders rolled down a mountainside. Tsulukidze was convinced that he dealt with regular Armenian army units because orders were submitted in Russian, which was the language used by the Armenian military command. In his view Sanahin itself was in danger. The Armenian side maintained that they had no regular troops involved until mid-December, when the oppression of the local peasantry had become too severe to continue tolerating. General Goguadze, who was in charge of the armoured trains, informed the Georgian government that rails between Sanahin and Alaverdi had been sabotaged, while Tsulukidze claimed his forces were suppressed by Armenian troops at Alaverdi. The Georgian side accused Armenian villages of harbouring Armenian army units.

===Armenian offensive===
On 13 December, with peaceful negotiations having failed, the government of Armenia ordered General Drastamat Kanayan to force the Georgian troops out of Lori. Captured documents revealed that Yerevan had made detailed plans to seize territories up to the river Khrami, into Georgia proper. Those seemed verified by the subsequent movements and activities of the Armenian troops. Kanayan commanded a force of 28 infantry companies, four cavalry squadrons, including reserves and was equipped with 26 machine guns and seven mountain cannons.
Armenia had fewer men, provisions, and ammunition than Georgia, however their troops held the decisive advantage of surprise and penetrating into friendly territory, enjoying the support from the local Armenian population and partisans. Armenian forces quickly made substantial gains. The 4th, 5th, and 6th Regiments advanced in three columns under Colonels Ter-Nikoghosian, Nesterovskii, and Korolkov, towards the line of villages, Vorontsovka-Privolnoye-Opret-Hairum. That afternoon, the Armenians had captured Haghpat, and General Varden Tsulukidze had been forced to evacuate from the Georgian headquarters at Sanahin. By 15 December, the Armenian army captured Vorontsovka, Privolnoye, Sanahin, Mikhayelovka, Alaverdi, and the heights between Haghpat and Akhova. The Georgians had left behind their dead and wounded. The Armenians had already captured almost a hundred Georgian soldiers, as well as many cavalry mounts, fifty freight cars, a locomotive, and several machine guns and mountain cannons.

On 16 December the Armenian left flank, commanded by Ter-Nikoghosian, now advanced from Lori into Georgia proper on Bolnis-Khachen and Katharinenfeld, while Korolov&#x27;s right flank captured Hairum. Georgian forces, that consisted mostly of People&#x27;s Guard units, offered poor resistance at Katharinenfeld and later at Shulaver, which put others forces in danger. The surprise attack at Hairum cost the Georgians an additional 500 men killed, wounded, or taken prisoner. On 17 December, the Georgian 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments were caught in a pincer movement by the two Armenian offensives and were able to escape, but suffered sixty extra casualties, as well as having to abandon two field guns and twenty five machine guns. The Armenians also captured two fully equipped Georgian armoured trains and Tsulukidze&#x27;s personal railway coach at the station of Akhtala. Tsulukidze had fled back to Sadakhlu, and by 18 December, the column under Ter-Nikoghosian had taken Bolnis-Khachen. Back in Tiflis, a state of emergency was declared.

Reinforcements of a thousand infantrymen, a cavalry squadron, and their final armoured train were sent by Georgian War Minister Grigol Giorgadze to Sadakhlu on 18 December. Nonetheless, the Armenian right flank continued pursuing the main Georgian force at Sadakhlu, and also captured Shulaver on 20 December. The Armenians had now approached the Khrami River. Other units moved on Sadakhlu, but came under fire within range of the armored train, and sustained their first heavy losses. However, the rails to the Georgian&#x27;s rear had been cut, and they were in danger of encirclement. On 22 December, the Armenians again attacked Sadakhlu and captured its station and the village outskirts, but were again forced back by the Georgian troops and their armoured train. Kanayan assembled twelve companies for a full-scale offensive. On 23 December, after hours of intense fighting, the Armenians occupied the strategic village. The Armenians took 132 Georgian POWs, over a hundred freight cars of food and munitions, 2 machine guns, and 3 trains. Casualties on the Armenian side were 7 killed and 11 wounded.

After the capture of Sadakhlu, Tsulukidze was relieved of his command and replaced by Major General Giorgi Mazniashvili. The Armenian army was now within 30 miles of the Georgian capital Tiflis. Armenian forces continued to advance on 24 December, but the next day the Georgians were reinforced by 1,000 new troops and airplanes, which bombed Shulaver. On 25 December, the Allied delegations in Tiflis had intervened to demand the war come to an end.

===Allied intervention===
An Allied military commission led by Lieutenant Colonels R. P. Jordan (Britain) and P. A. Chardigny (France) had been stationed in Tiflis. Georgian Foreign Minister Evgeni Gegechkori had appealed to them for intervention on 15 December. Jordan suggested all Armenian and Georgian forces withdraw from the disputed territory, which would be policed by British troops until its status was decided at the Paris Peace Conference. Gegechkori was in favor of a status quo ante bellum.

The Armenian representatives in Tiflis were not included in these early negotiations. The British and French had only messaged Premier Kajaznuni by 25 December, when diplomat Arshak Jamalyan was sent to negotiate. Jamalyan protested this one-sided treatment and objected to the annexation of any territories the Armenians controlled. The Allies wired a decision to Yerevan on 25 December. By this time, all of Lori and much of Borchaly had been controlled by Kanayan&#x27;s forces:

The decision was signed by Rycroft, Chardigny, and Zhordania, who called on both Armenian and Georgian military leaders to cease their activities. The Allies decided to impose the plan with or without the approval of the government of Armenia. Armenian officials decided to agree to the truce, on the condition that they be allowed to send a delegation to Tiflis to resolve any ambiguities in the settlement. A ceasefire was to take place on 31 December 1918.

===Georgian counteroffensives and final clashes===
Both sides attempted to maintain favorable positions before the ceasefire came into effect. The Armenian soldiers had marched for two weeks without rest. No reinforcements could be sent by the government. The supplies of Armenian troops now mostly consisted of bread and munitions captured from the Georgians. An outbreak of typhus had also occurred. Conversely, the Georgians were able to quickly send reinforcements and plan operations now that hostilities were so close to Tiflis.

Several skirmishes took place from 25 to 27 December. Though the Georgian efforts had become more brazen, positions changed little during these days. On 28 December, the Georgians had made a breakthrough when a force of 3,500 instructed by Mazniashvili overtook Shulaver, as well as a number of smaller villages. The Armenians suffered 200 casualties. Over the next two days, the Armenians and Georgians fought over Sadakhlu, which changed hands several times. Eventually the two armies entrenched themselves in a stalemate, with the Armenians in station and Georgians in the town.

The final confrontations took place on 31 December, before the ceasefire would come into effect at midnight. The Armenians made strategic gains at their center and right columns, but the typhus-infected left column was pushed back. Late in the afternoon, Armenian soldiers outflanked the Georgians and took the eastern heights of Sadakhlu. In addition, the Armenians had also cut the railway leading Shulaver in Mamai. At the end of the day, both armies were situated along irregular lines. The north, south, and east of Sadakhlu were controlled by the Armenians, while the Georgians had advanced a considerable distance southwest of the village.

==Persecution of Armenians in Georgia==

Throughout the war, Armenians in Georgia were heavily persecuted, and many were arrested without cause. Several organisations were shut down, including charities for refugees and orphans. Armenian newspapers were banned, and members of the Tiflis City Council with Armenian background were arrested. The governor of Tiflis proclaimed that every Armenian civilian was a technical prisoner-of-war. Many of the arrested Armenians were extorted and threatened with execution if they refused. Ransom prices varied between 50 and 50,000 rubles. Even after the ceasefire had been declared, thousands of arrests were made on 5 January 1919.

In January 1919, hundreds of arrested Armenian civilians were marched to Kutaisi, where they were paraded as prisoners-of-war. Georgia had actually captured few Armenian soldiers during the war. The parades were meant to prove the Georgian government&#x27;s official narrative of the war as being an astonishing Georgian victory.

The persecutions were even more severe in villages outside Tiflis. In the village of Bolnis-Khachen, Georgian militias committed several acts of murder, rape and looting. Armenian peasants had been robbed of grain, crops, fabrics, livestock and various other possessions. Several homes were also destroyed. In Belyi-Kliuch, Georgian soldiers went to an orphanage demanding women. After not finding any, the Georgians instead raped prepubescent girls. They returned to the same orphanage a few days later to commit more rapes. Appeals were made to the Georgian authorities, which went ignored.

==Aftermath and assessment==

The Allied, Georgian and Armenian officials met to discuss a final settlement from 9 to 17 January 1919. Diplomatic and trade relations were resumed between the two republics. Prisoners were also returned on 23 January. The British created a neutral zone, centred in the Borchaly uezd and reaching from Sadakhlu to the prewar border with Armenia. A commissioner general, eventually decided to be Captain A. S. G. Douglas, would administer the zone and have ultimate authority on the number of Armenian and Georgian troops stationed within it. The neutral zone was split into the districts of Uzunlar, Vorontsovka, and Alaverdi. There were 41–43 villages within the neutral zone with large Armenian populations.

The war caused Allied perception of both Armenia and Georgia to become more negative. Many argued that independence for the Transcaucasian states would result in conflict and instability for the region. That proved to be a critical time, as their fates would be decided at the Paris Peace Conference a few weeks after the ceasefire.

The outcome of the war is disputed. Both the Armenians and Georgians claimed victory. Both sides also felt that they would have had a decisive victory if it had not been for the ceasefire imposed by the Allies. The Armenians had succeeded in forcing the Georgians out of northern Lori, which became a neutral zone eventually split between the two republics. However, their goal had been to seize land up to the Khrami River. The Armenians had advanced during most of the war. Although the Georgians began a counterattack in the final days, they reached a stalemate before the ceasefire. However, the war took place entirely in lands formerly controlled by Georgia. The Armenian army also suffered fewer casualties. The historian Richard G. Hovannisian suggests that the result of the conflict was inconclusive.

In Soviet historiography, the war is portrayed as being instigated by &quot;Entente imperialists&quot; and that the Lori neutral zone was commanded by &quot;British imperialists&quot; and &quot;Georgian Mensheviks&quot;.

<text>The garmon (, from , cognate of English &quot;harmonica&quot;), commonly called garmoshka, is a kind of Russian button accordion, a free-reed wind instrument. A garmon has two rows of buttons on the right side, which play the notes of a diatonic scale, and at least two rows of buttons on the left side, which play the primary chords in the key of the instrument as well as its relative harmonic minor key. Many instruments have additional right-hand buttons with useful accidental notes, additional left-hand chords for playing in related keys, and a row of free-bass buttons, to facilitate playing of bass melodies.

The garmons can be of two major classes: unisonoric, meaning that each button plays the same note or chord when the bellows is being expanded as it does when compressed; and bisonoric, in which the note depends on the direction of the bellowswork. Examples of unisonoric type are (, after Livny, Oryol Oblast), (, &#x27;chromatic&#x27;), Tula accordion (, after Tula) and (, &#x27;Italian&#x27;)

Beside Russian folk music, the garmon is an important musical instrument for Caucasian (Ossetian, Georgian, Cherkess, etc.) and Mari people in the Volga and Ural regions, and in Slovenian music. It is also used in popular music.

== Keyboard arrangement ==
Although reduced and expanded versions are widely available, the standard arrangement (known as &quot;25 × 25&quot;) is as follows:
*25 treble buttons in two rows: three diatonic octaves plus three accidentals. There are versions with 27 treble buttons adding 2 more accidentals, and versions with 29 treble buttons adding 2 more high notes also exist.
*25 bass buttons in three rows: two rows of eight buttons, with bass notes and chords; one free-bass row.

The treble keyboard is arranged so that a scale may be played by alternating between the two rows. The low and high octaves have identical fingering, while the middle octave differs. The three accidental notes are arranged so as to mirror the position of the left-hand chords that contain them.

===Left hand===
The bass keyboard is arranged so that the principal chords for the major key are in the outer row, placed in circle of fifths order; the principal chords for the harmonic minor key are in the middle row; free bass notes are in the inner row. One free bass accidental note is included.
There are also 36*36 garmon accordions which have a third row of buttons including more accidentals and high notes, as well as more free bass notes.

== Russian types ==
Since the introduction of the accordion from Germany to Russia in the 1830s, Russian masters invented a lot of different types of local garmons during the 19th and 20th centuries.

=== Khromka ===

The () was invented in 1870 in Tula by Russian musician Nikolay Beloborodov. It was a unisonoric (like the bayan or piano accordion), diatonic accordion but on the right keyboard there were also two or three chromatic buttons, usually g1♯, d2♯, f2♯, hence the name &quot;khromka&quot;. It became the most popular and widespread button accordion in Russia, so almost all modern Russian (as well as Soviet) garmons (usually made in Tula and Shuya factories) are khromkas.

=== Tula garmon ===
Tula garmon () was the first Russian accordion, which began to be manufactured since the 1830s. It had five or seven buttons on the right keyboard, and like in the most Western diatonic accordions it produced different sounds on pull and push. So Tula garmon had two full diatonic octaves (from C4 to C6). The left bass keyboard had two buttons. Tula garmon was a base for all the Russian diatonic bisonoric garmoshkas (Saratov, Kasimov etc.)

=== Vyatka garmon ===

Vyatka garmon () first appeared on the factories of Vyatka governorate in the middle of the 19th century. It was chromatic unisonoric, it had a piano keyboard on the right side and two bass buttons on the left one. Vyatka garmon was a prototype for many different types of national accordions in the Volga region and the Caucasus (see below). Also after it there were made Russian diatonic and chromatic accordions: Elets &quot;royal&quot; (means with a piano keyboard, because in Russian a grand piano is called &quot;royal&quot;) garmon, Beloborodov&#x27;s royal garmon (made by Tula master Chulkov in the 1870s on the design of Beloborodov, it had a full chromatic right keyboard and resembled modern piano accordions) and others.

===Saratov garmon===

The &quot;Saratov garmon&quot; () is a diatonic, bisonoric garmoshka with bells which ring when the bass and chord keys are played. Lidia Ruslanova sang to the accompaniment of this garmonika.

=== Livenka ===

The &quot;livenka&quot; () or &quot;Livenskaya garmoshka&quot; () was developed in the 1860s and 1870s in the factories around the town of Livny (Oryol Oblast).

== Asian and Caucasian garmons ==
Russian garmons were popular not only among the Russians but also among the other nations of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Almost all the national garmons are based on the Tula, Vyatka and Khromka garmons, with modifications to fit the local national musical traditions. Some were professionally invented in music factories in the 20th century.

=== Volga, Ural and Siberian regions ===
* The Mari accordion (&quot;marla-karmon&quot;) is a seven-button, diatonic, bisonoric instrument based on the Tula garmon.
* The Mari &quot;koga-karmon&quot; and Chuvash &quot;kubos&quot; are based on the khromka.

=== Caucasian ===

The or &quot;Ossetian accordion&quot; was based on the European accordion. It was designed for the features of Ossetian folk music, and was adopted by other musicians from other Caucasian peoples, becoming popular all over the Caucasus.

=== Oriental accordion ===

The &quot;oriental bayan&quot; () was invented in 1936 in the Kazan musical factory, it has a right-hand piano keyboard but a little smaller, so in fact it imitates a piano accordion. In 1961 the Kazan revised it so that the left keyboard mirrored the right, though the left buttons are not rectangular but round, like in button accordions. This type is popular in the music of Azerbaijan, where it is known as the . It has been popularized in Azerbaijan by Aftandil Israfilov. It has been popularized in Turkey, too, through the recordings of Nejat Özgür.

=== Georgia and Armenia ===
The came to Georgia and Armenia from Europe, namely from Russia, in the 1830s, and immediately became popular among folk musicians. It is especially popular in Tusheti, where it is used as an accompanying instrument for vocals, and also as a solo instrument. The garmoni has two miniature variants, the and the .

The is widespread especially among the mountain inhabitants of Georgia, with its own distinct sound. It is considered a women&#x27;s instrument, and often a bride was presented with a buzik at the time of her engagement. It was widely used for national holidays, festivals, and parties, and is associated mainly with song and dance melodies. It is also sometimes used for performing solo melodies, or in an ensemble with a doli (drum), daira, diplipito, and panduri.

The , came to Georgia and Armenia from Europe in the 1830s, and mainly accompanies dances.

==Slovenia==
In Slovenia, the (see Steirische Harmonika) is popular in traditional and modern music. Some artists have achieved popularity in Europe and the United States of America. The Slovenian style of play differs from the Russian. There are over 300 popular ensembles in Slovenia, one ensemble often consisting of several singers and an accordionist.

<doc id="1205143" wikidata="Q4722705" url="?curid=1205143" title="Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain">
<text>Alfred George Gardyne de Chastelain, DSO, OBE (1906–1974) was a British-Canadian businessman, soldier, and secret agent, noted for his actions during World War II. He was the father of Canadian General John de Chastelain.

== Early life and stay in Romania ==

Born in London in February 1906, of Anglo-Scottish parents and of Huguenot background, he was educated in Scotland and the University of London, from which he received a First class degree in Engineering. On graduation, he moved to Romania and worked for Unirea (a British Petroleum branch) in Bucharest, rising to a managerial position towards the end of the 1930s. While in Bucharest, he married Marion Elizabeth Walsh, the daughter of Jack Walsh, an American accountant with Standard Oil of New Jersey in Romania.

== Wartime activities with the SOE ==
On the outbreak of war with Nazi Germany, de Chastelain was commissioned into the Artists&#x27; Rifles and became a member of Special Operations Executive (SOE), with which organisation he conducted sabotage operations in the Balkans and served in the North African campaign.

In late 1943, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he led a team of two other SOE members (Ivor Porter and Silviu Meţianu) by parachute into Romania (Operation Autonomous), to test the possibility of the country&#x27;s surrender to the Allies as the Axis was losing battles on the Eastern Front (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;). Captured by the Romanian Gendarmerie soon after their landing near Plosca, Teleorman County, he and his team were taken into custody as prisoners of war and held in a Bucharest apartment.

They were all released in August 1944, when &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu was overthrown and King Michael I assumed full powers (&quot;see King Michael Coup&quot;). Decorated, de Chastelain was demobilised after the war, joining a unit of the Special Air Service in the Territorial Army.

== Life in the post-war era ==
After the start of the Cold War, Soviet authorities alleged that he was keeping contacts with Iuliu Maniu, the leader of the National Peasants&#x27; Party; the latter had opposed both Antonescu&#x27;s regime and the Soviet occupation of Romania. During Maniu&#x27;s trial for treason (1947), the Minister of the Interior, Teohari Georgescu, was handed a report which indicated Maniu&#x27;s alleged contacts with de Chastelain as proof that the politician was a British spy.

Alongside a group of partners, de Chastelain started &quot;Griffin Enterprises&quot; (1945), a business centered in London and Kent, dealing in film processing, import and exports and other activities. In 1954, he left that business to accept a post as Vice-President of the Canadian branch of an American oilwell drilling and services company, H. J. Eastman, in Calgary, Alberta. Living for several years in Canada and then in Australia, he returned to Canada in the early 1970s and died in Calgary at the age of 68.

A book giving an account of the SOE Operation in Romania was written by one member of the team, Ivor Porter, later a British Ambassador (&quot;Operation Autonomous: With SOE in Wartime Rumania&quot;, Chatto and Windus, 1989).

He was a founding member of the Special Forces Club in Knightsbridge, and of the &quot;Food and Wine Society&quot; in Calgary.

<text>Sir William Keith Hancock, (26 June 1898 – 13 August 1988), also known as W. K. Hancock, was a prominent Australian historian and academic. Hancock was an Anglican and keen admirer of the British Empire.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Melbourne, Colony of Victoria, the son of Archdeacon William Hancock. At the age of nine, he won the Royal Humane Society&#x27;s medal for rescuing another child from drowning in the Mitchell River. He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and later the University of Melbourne where he was resident at Trinity College from 1917, winning the Perry Scholarship, Trinity&#x27;s most prestigious award. Too young to see service in World War I without permission from his parents, it was said that he always felt shame about the fact he could not fight; however, this age restriction did not apply after his 18th birthday in June 1916, less than halfway through the war.

As the Australia-at-large Rhodes Scholar for 1921, Hancock went to Balliol College, Oxford in 1922. He graduated in 1924 with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in Modern History. He was the first Australian to gain a Fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford in 1923.

== Academic career ==
He was Professor of Modern History at the University of Adelaide between 1924 and 1933. On his appointment he was aged only 25, the youngest professor in the British Commonwealth, and one who had held no previous teaching post. In 1930 he published &quot;Australia&quot;, a book which was well received and notable for its ironic tone, particularly in criticism of Australian institutions such as tariff protection, was highly influential, and is still frequently quoted today.

From 1934 to 1944 Hancock was the Professor of History at University of Birmingham and during this war period was also appointed to the War Cabinet Offices. His &quot;Survey of British Commonwealth Affairs&quot; was published in three volumes in 1937–42. In 1941 he was appointed Supervisor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of the History of the Second World War and was thereafter editor of the series. In 1943, he published &quot;Argument of Empire&quot;, he defended the British Empire.

In 1949, with Margaret Gowing, he wrote &quot;The British War Economy&quot;, the introductory volume to that series. Between 1944 and 1949, he returned to Oxford, becoming Chichele Professor of Economic History. During the War he also played a role in Civil Defence, serving as a firewatcher. He was knighted in 1953, partially for his services in writing and editing the histories.

In 1949 he left Oxford, taking up an appointment as the Director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies. He served as the Professor of British Commonwealth Affairs at the University of London until 1956. During this period he was sent as a government expert to examine constitutional questions in Uganda in 1954, at the height of the Kabaka crisis. At this time he began work on his authoritative biography of the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, which appeared in two volumes in 1962 and 1968, and editing for publication, with Jean van der Poel, the first four volumes of the Smuts papers.

Hancock returned to Australia in 1957 to take up an appointment as Director of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University, a position he held until 1961. He was Professor of History at the Institute of Advanced Studies, ANU until his retirement in 1965. On his retirement he was made Emeritus Professor (1968) and created the first University Fellow of the ANU. Other positions he held were Chairman of the Editorial Board of the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot; from 1958 to 1965 and inaugural President of the Australian Academy of the Humanities from 1969 to 1971.

In 1961 he was appointed to the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. In his honour, a library of science resources at the ANU was named after him.

He retired in 1965, having been appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1965 New Year&#x27;s Honours. In these later years he moved south of Canberra, becoming a firm supporter of environmental politics. He disliked American bases on Australian soil, and he was a very prominent but ultimately unsuccessful opponent of the construction of Black Mountain Tower in Canberra.

He married Theaden Brocklebank in 1925; she died in 1960. In 1961, he married Marjorie Eyre, who had been his research assistant for the previous 15 years. He died in Canberra on 13 August 1988.

The science library at the Australian National University was named in his honour.

<doc id="1205160" wikidata="Q1333801" url="?curid=1205160" title="Jackson Guitars">
<text>Jackson is a brand of guitars sold by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Jackson was originally an independent manufacturer of electric guitars and electric bass guitars named after its founder, the American luthier Grover Jackson. The company was acquired by Fender in 2002, which manufactures Jackson-branded guitars in its Corona, California, US, Fujigen and Tokyo Fender Japan and Ensenada, Mexico facilities. Low-priced &quot;budget&quot; models are produced by sub-contractors in Indonesia and China.

==History==
===Early years===
Grover Jackson obtained part ownership in Charvel&#x27;s Guitar Repair of Glendora, California in the 1970s. Wayne Charvel eventually filed bankruptcy and sold his interest to Grover Jackson on November 10, 1978, which gave Jackson control of the Charvel name.

Jackson Guitars originated in 1980 when guitarist Randy Rhoads approached the company with an idea for an individualized guitar. The collaborative design effort between Rhoads, Grover Jackson, Tim Wilson, and Jackson&#x27;s masterbuilder, Mike Shannon, resulted in the creation of the &quot;Concorde&quot;, an innovative revamp of the traditional Flying V. These designs were such a departure from Charvel&#x27;s Stratocaster-based models that Jackson elected to label them under a different brand name. He chose his own last name, and created the first Jackson guitar.

Throughout the heavy metal heyday of the 1980s, the Jackson brand was associated with high-quality, American-made, custom instruments, and was used by many popular guitarists of the period. In addition to the original, as they came to be known, Rhoads models, the 1980s spawned distinctively designed Jackson models such as the &quot;Soloist&quot;, &quot;King V&quot;, &quot;Kelly&quot;, and the &quot;Dinky&quot;, all of which remain icons of the brand.

===1990s–present===

The 1990s brought changes in musical trends. While still making the high-end American-made products, brands like Jackson began producing inexpensive, Asian-made versions of their staple designs in an effort to make their products more accessible to lower-end buyers.

Guitars made for Jackson by Chushin Japan could be of particularly high quality. An example the King V Pro Dave Mustaine signature model was equipped with the same pickups, hardware and materials as the Ontario Jackson Shop version.
( Chushin also produced some domestic market guitars under the Grover Jackson name.)

In the Fall of 2002, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation purchased Jackson from IMC, the company which had bought Jackson from Grover Jackson, and U.S. operations were moved to the Fender factory in Corona. Medium-high-end Jackson guitars were briefly made in Japan. Present day Fender-era Jackson and Charvel guitars are produced at Corona, California, Fujigen Nagano and Fender&#x27;s Ensenada facility. Low-priced &quot;budget&quot; models are produced by sub-contractors based in Indonesia and China.

After several years of running a successful company doing sub-contracting work for many well known guitar companies and extensive design consultancy, Grover Jackson is now co-owner of a new guitar brand, GJ2 Guitars, in Orange County, California. His partner in this venture is former Fender Senior Vice President Jon Gold.

== Design hallmarks ==

From the earliest beginnings until the present day, Jackson Guitars is known for its slender, elegant designs, and feature aggressive motifs that are popular with hard rock and metal musicians.

Traditionally, Jackson (and many Charvel) guitars share the typical pointed headstock that first appeared on Randy Rhoads&#x27;s prototype in 1980. This likely arose from trade dress infringement issues as a result of Charvel&#x27;s use of Fender Stratocaster shaped headstocks until the early 1980s. Fender&#x27;s 2002 acquisition of both the Jackson and Charvel brands has enabled the Strat-style headstock to be reintroduced (under license).

Another Jackson trademark is the &#x27;shark fin&#x27; inlays, which inspired other famous guitar companies such as Ibanez to follow suit with similar designs.

Jackson 2021 guitar models: Concert Bass, Demmelition Fury, Dinky, Dominion, Juggernaut, Kelly, Kelly Bird, King V, MF 1, Monarkh, PC 1, Rhoads, San Dimas, Shadowcaster, Soloist, Spectra Bass, Star, Warrior.

<doc id="1205177" wikidata="Q7988225" url="?curid=1205177" title="Western Region of British Railways">
<text>The Western Region was a region of British Railways from 1948. The region ceased to be an operating unit in its own right on completion of the &quot;Organising for Quality&quot; initiative on 6 April 1992. The Region consisted principally of ex-Great Western Railway lines, minus certain lines west of Birmingham, which were transferred to the London Midland Region in 1963 and with the addition of all former Southern Railway routes west of Exeter, which were subsequently rationalised.

== History ==

When British Railways was created at the start of 1948, it was immediately subdivided into six Regions, largely based upon pre-nationalisation ownership. The Western Region initially consisted of the former Great Western Railway system, totalling 3,782 route miles and with its headquarters at Paddington. To this was added some minor railways and joint lines in which the GWR had an interest:
*Brynmawr and Western Valleys Railway
*Clifton Extension Railway
*Easton and Church Hope Railway
*Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway – including the Banbury Junction Railway between Banbury and Culworth Junction
*Halesowen Railway
*Rhymney Joint Railway
*Severn and Wye and Severn Bridge Railway
*Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway
*Shrewsbury and Wellington Joint Railway
*Shrewsbury and Welshpool Railway
*Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway
*Tenbury Railway
*Vale of Towy Railway
*West Cornwall Railway
*West London Railway
*West London Extension Railway
*Weymouth and Portland Railway
*Wrexham and Minera Railway
Regional boundaries were adjusted several times in subsequent years. The first such adjustments took place on 2 April 1950, under which the WR gained
*Banbury Merton Street station &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
*Bicester to Oxford &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
*Broom to Byfield (excluding Byfield station) &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
*Cole to Bath, Bridgwater, Burnham and Wells &quot;from the Southern Region&quot;
*Exeter to Bude, Ilfracombe, Padstow, Plymouth and branches &quot;from the Southern Region&quot;
*Hadley Junction to Coalport &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
*Leamington Spa Avenue station &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
*Marylebone to Northolt Junction &quot;from the Eastern Region&quot;
*Neasden to Harrow (excluding Harrow station) &quot;from the Eastern Region&quot;
*Selly Oak to Bath and Bristol, and all branches from that route &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
*Warwick Milverton station &quot;from the London Midland Region&quot;
At the same time, the WR lost several lines:
*Crudgington to Nantwich &quot;to the London Midland Region&quot;
*Grafton &amp; Burbage to Andover Junction &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;
*Newbury to Winchester &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;
*Reading West to Basingstoke &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;
*Sparkford to Weymouth, including branches &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;
*Thorney &amp; Kingsbury Halt to Yeovil &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;
*Thornfalcon to Chard Central &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;
*Westbury to Salisbury &quot;to the Southern Region&quot;

The Great Western Railway (GWR) was established during the 19th century. Although run down by the Second World War, its management opposed its nationalisation into British Railways. Even after nationalisation under the Transport Act 1947 and amalgamation with the other railway companies as British Railways, the new Region continued its enmity with its powerful neighbour, the London Midland Region, which had been born out of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. There were few incomers to the Region at senior level: for example, the Chairman of the Regional Board from 1955, Reggie Hanks, came from the motor industry but had been a Swindon Works apprentice. In the 1956–1962 period, a range of express trains were named and their coaches given GWR-style chocolate and cream colours.

Major changes came on the appointment from outside as Regional Managers Stanley Raymond (in 1962) and Gerry Fiennes (in 1963); both worked hard to eliminate the Western Region&#x27;s large financial operating deficit.

Some revenues were increased, but most of the savings came from cuts. Adjusted for transfer of Banbury northward to LMR and Dorset, Devon and Cornwall from SR, the assets of WR reduced greatly over the decade 1955–1965 and especially from 1963 to 1965:

== Infrastructure ==
Major new investment in infrastructure did not go ahead substantially until after 1955. The earliest projects included the rebuilding of stations at Banbury and Plymouth, both postponed since the 1940s; of less long-term relevance were new facilities at Paignton for summer holiday passenger traffic and a marshalling yard at Margam in South Wales. Bristol Parkway station opened in 1972.

== Rolling stock ==
The Western Region built a large number of steam locomotives to GWR designs including 341 pannier tanks, even after the advent of diesel shunters. Both 2-6-0 tender and 2-6-2 tank engine variants of the BR Standard Class 3 were also built by the Western Region. It was the first region of BR to eliminate steam traction under the 1955 Modernisation Plan.

While the other BR regions introduced diesel-electric locomotives the Western Region went its own way by purchasing a complete range of diesel-hydraulic locomotives covering the type 1 to type 4 power requirements. These included the &quot;Warship&quot; locomotives, which were based on proven West German designs, the British-designed Class 14, &quot;Hymek&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; types; these were all eventually withdrawn and replaced with more standard British Rail diesel-electric classes such as the Class 37 and Class 47 upon the British Railways Board declaring diesel-hydraulic locomotives &quot;non-standard&quot; in an attempt to reduce costs.

One of the major improvements on the Western Region, and later on the Eastern Region East Coast Main Line, was the introduction on the Great Western Main Line of the InterCity 125 trains in 1976/7 bringing major accelerations to the timetables.

<doc id="1205180" wikidata="Q2631596" url="?curid=1205180" title="Georgian mythology">
<text>Georgian mythology () refers to the mythology of pre-Christian Georgians (; Georgian: ქართველები, romanized: kartvelebi, ), an indigenous Caucasian ethnic group native to Georgia and the South Caucasus. The mythology of the Kartvelian peoples is believed by many scholars to have formed part of the religions of the kingdoms of Diauehi, Colchis and Iberia.

Later influences include the mythologies of the Ancient Greeks, the Vainakh peoples and Iranians – the last-named comprising both the belief systems of the Northern Iranian nomad Scythians and Sarmatians (still preserved to some extent in the mythology of their descendants the Ossetians) and that of the Zoroastrian religion of the Ancient Persian empire, which has left an enduring legacy among the nations of the Caucasus. (See also Iranian religions)

Georgian myths and legends are preserved mainly as popular tales, many of them eventually fusing with Christian legends after the Christianization of Georgia seventeen centuries ago. The evangelizing of Georgia, however, was far from uniform. While the lowland populations embraced Christianity in the fifth century, the highlanders of the mountain valleys in the Greater Caucasus range were converted some ten centuries later – and only superficially. Survivals of pagan beliefs and practices in the Georgian plains are thus, understandably, heavily influenced by Christianity, lacking in mythological unity and essentially folkloric. 

==Khevsur/Pshav creation myth (northeastern Georgia)==
In the beginning, there existed only the head god (მორიგე ღმერთი) and his Sister. She made him unhappy, so he cursed her. The sister became a demon. For every good thing that the head god created, the Demon created an evil thing to mar it and oppose it. Women too was a creation of the Demon, as were the lesser demons ( – see below), while men and the lesser gods were creations of Morige Ghmerti. The lesser gods grew weary in their unceasing fight with the demons and fled to the upper world of Zeskneli (ზესკნელი), leaving behind the men. The men however lacked the power to resist the demons, so the lesser gods ( – see below) hunted down the demons and drove them underground to the netherworld of Kveskneli (ქვესკნელი). The demons left behind them the women who, like them, were part of the evil creation.

Men and women are thus only emanations of, or substitutes for, the gods above and the demons below, respectively. The same principle holds true for all created things: the entities and substances of the universe are divided into two antagonistic series, one wild and demonic, the other social and divine. The only entities or substances that are truly real are those of the upper world of Zeskneli and the lower world of Kveskneli. The middle world inhabited by humans is thus only a place of passage and meeting, and the beings who people it have no essence in themselves, being only emanations of the divine or subterranean worlds, or else their unions.

== Cosmology ==

In pre-Christian Georgian mythology, the universe is perceived as a sphere. It comprises three worlds or levels, known as &quot;skneli&quot; (სკნელი):

* &quot;Zeskneli&quot; (ზესკნელი) – the highest world, and the home of the gods. White is the color of Zeskneli.
* The Earth – the middle world, home of mortals. Its center is divided into two regions, anterior (&quot;tsina samkaro&quot;, წინა სამყარო; or &quot;tsinaskneli&quot;, წინასკნელი) and posterior (&quot;ukana samkaro&quot;, უკანა სამყარო; or &quot;ukana skneli&quot;, უკანასკნელი); – beyond which the lands of Earth are divided by seven or nine mountains (or seas), which a hero can traverse only by first undergoing a spiritual transformation (known as &quot;gardatsvaleba&quot; (გარდაცვალება) – which is also the word for &quot;death&quot;) and seeking the help of magical animals, such as the Paskunji, the Rashi and others. Red is the colour of this world.
* &quot;Kveskneli&quot; (ქვესკნელი) – the lowest world or underworld, inhabited by the ogres, serpents, and demons. Black is the colour of Kveskneli.

== Practices of Shamanic Type ==
The mountain Georgian equivalent of the shaman is the &quot;Kadagi&quot;, a person (of either gender) who has become permanently possessed by one of the class of minor (i.e. local / specialised) divinities known most often by the name of &quot;Hat&#x27;i&quot; (= &#x27;sign&#x27; ), but also by those of &quot;Dzhuar&quot; (= &#x27;cross&#x27;) and &quot;Saghmto&quot; (= &#x27;divinity&#x27;). The &quot;Hat&#x27;i&quot; numbered several hundred at the turn of the nineteenth century and the word &quot;Hat&#x27;i&quot; could designate not only a divinity of this class but also its manifestation ( as image, object or real or imaginary animal ) and the place (temple / sanctuary) where it was worshipped. The &quot;Kadag&quot; would go into trance, both at religious rituals and at events important in individual or collective life, and his or her indwelling &quot;Hat&#x27;i&quot; would foretell the future in a special secret or sacred &#x27;language of the &quot;Hat&#x27;i&quot; &#x27; (see also Spirit possession).

A second type of practitioner of shamanic type (exclusively female) was the &quot;Mesultane&quot; – the word deriving from Georgian &quot;suli&quot; &#x27;soul&#x27;. A &quot;Mesultane&quot; – usually a woman, although sometimes as young as a girl of nine – was a female who possessed &#x27;the faculty of visiting the beyond in spirit&#x27;. At certain times these females would plunge into &#x27;a lethargy broken by mutterings&#x27;, following which they would awaken and describe their &#x27;journey&#x27;, communicating the requests of the dead to particular individuals or to the community at large. From their ability to enter these trance states they would derive honours and prestige.

== List of supernatural beings from Georgian myth ==
===Gods===
*Adgilis Deda (ადგილის დედა) – A goddess of fertility and livestock revered by the inhabitants of the mountainous areas of northeastern Georgia (such as Khevsureti) as the patroness of certain places and of travellers. She is portrayed as a beautiful lady with silver jewellery. She later became associated with the Virgin Mary when the area was converted to Christianity. Her name means &quot;Mother of Locality&quot;.
*Ainina and Danina (აინინა და დანინა) – A pair of goddesses who are mentioned in &quot;The Conversion of Kartli&quot; and the mediaeval Georgian Chronicles.
*Elia (ელია) – The god of rain and thunder in Georgian mythology.
*Apsat (აფსათი) – A male god of birds and animals in Svan mythology.
*Shavkhan (შავხანი) – God of blacksmithing in Svan mythology.
*Bedis Mtserlebi (ბედის მწერლები) – Deities who write the fate of humans and all other spiritual beings with the help of their magic book. 
*Armazi (არმაზი) – Chief of the gods; central figure in the official religion of (Caucasian) Iberia (= Kartli) established by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia (4th century BC). According to the &quot;Life of Saint Nino&quot; an immense statue of Armazi – along with images of other deities and the temple that housed them – was destroyed by a storm of giant hailstones raised by the prayers of Saint Nino. Armazi is also the name of an ancient fortress near Mtskheta that dates from the same period. Various complementary strands of research suggest that the origins of this deity lie in a syncretism between conceptions of the Zoroastrian supreme being Ahura Mazda () and a native Georgian supreme lunar deity (see also Tetri Giorgi below) – a regional variant of the Hittite moon god Arma.
*Barbale (ბარბალე) – The goddess of cattle and poultry fertility, the sun, women&#x27;s fertility, and healing.
*Batonebi (ბატონები) – Spirits of disease. Their name means &quot;the masters&quot;. In modern use &quot;Batonebi&quot; is used as a term to refer to a small set of infectious diseases, that are often prominent among children (measles, chickenpox and few others) If anyone is infected by the Batonebi, following one tradition their family will prepare special food and candies, and place presents under trees to appease the Batonebi (Traditions vary, but general motif is for whole family to appease the sick child).
*Beri Bera (ბერი ბერა) – An agricultural god of fertility, harvests, and animals who is worshipped in eastern Georgia. His festival is held at the end of the year.
*Dali (დალი), Svanetian &#x27;Dæl&#x27; – the goddess of the hunt. She was believed to have extraordinary beauty, with long golden hair and radiant white skin. She dwells high up in the mountains, in a shining golden cave where she watches over and protects wild animals. She sometimes shares animals with hunters, as long as they respect her rules by not hunting more than their needed amounts or taking aim at animals that are her manifestations. In some myths, she will enter into a sexual relationship with a hunter, while warning him not to reveal their liaison upon pain of death by causing him to fall to his death from a cliff, usually during a hunt – the fate also of those who break promises they have made her. She is the mother of the hero Amiran.
*Gatsi and Gaim (გაცი და გაიმი) – Gods in the official Iberian pantheon according to the medieval annals.
*Ghmerti (ღმერთი) – The supreme divinity and the head of the pantheon of gods. He is the all-powerful Lord of the Universe and its Creator. He lives in the ninth sky, where he rules from a golden throne. His children include the moon (as his son), the sun (as his daughter), and the &quot;Ghvtis Shvilni&quot; who protect people against evil. He is also addressed as Morige Ghmerti (მორიგე ღმერთი, &quot;God the Director&quot;) and Dambadebeli (დამბადებელი, &quot;The Creator&quot;). His name is later used to refer to God the Father in Christian belief.
*Kamar (ყამარი) The daughter of the god of the sky. She is a symbol of divine fire. Her beautiful appearance caused Amiran to abduct her from heaven.
*Lamaria, also Lamara (ლამარია) – goddess of fertility, cattle, and the hearth
*Mamber (მამბერი) – The lord of wolves ( compare Ossetian Tutyr – see below under heading &#x27;Tevdore&#x27; ), who was worshiped in Svaneti and other mountainous regions.
*Michpa (მიჭპა) – The patron god of cattle and other domestic animals who was worshiped in Svaneti during winter.
*Mindort Batoni (მინდორთ ბატონი) – The god of valleys, fields, and wild flowers. Humans have to ask his permission before exploring or attempting to cultivate the fruitful lands that make up his domain. His daughter, Mindort Brdzanebeli, is the beautiful goddess of flowers.
*Mindort Brdzanebeli (მინდორთ ბრძანებელი) – The goddess of flowers. She is the daughter of the god Mindort Batoni. She flutters over plants, feeding on their pollen.
*Ochopintre (ოჩოპინტრე) – A spirit of the forest and protector of wild animals. The first part of his name (ocho, ოჭო) is connected to the ancient pagan god Bochi, the second part (pintre, პინტრე) to the Greek god Pan. Born with the legs and horns of a goat, he assists the goddess Dali in herding the animals. Hunters usually made sacrifice in his name since no one could hunt the animals without his help. The fate of a person entering his forest was believed to be fully in his hands.
*Samdzimari (სამძიმარი) – demon-born goddess of fertility and oracles, seducer of men.
*Tamar (თამარი) – Goddess who enslaved the Morning Star and controlled the weather patterns; was called &quot;eye of the earth&quot; and rode a serpent.
*Tetri Giorgi (თეთრი გიორგი, &quot;White George&quot;), form of Saint George venerated in Kakheti, variously identified as a reflex of the ancient lunar god, and as a reflex of the ancient storm/weather god (Kopala).
*Tevdore (თევდორე) – God of agriculture and horses. After Christianization, he became associated with St. Theodore. In feudal times the special festival of Tedoroba was organised to honor him and ensure a bountiful harvest.
*Tskarishdida (წყარიშდიდა) – A mermaid-like goddess of rivers, lakes and fish, in Mingrelian folklore. She uses magic powers against humans.
*Zaden (ზადენი) – God of fertility in the official pantheon established by Pharnavaz I. He was believed to be as powerful as Armazi. He was added into the official pantheon by Parnajom in the second century BC, and had a statue of him erected at a fortress near Mt. Zedazeni, near Mtskheta. His statue was said to have been destroyed with the statues of other gods through the prayers of St. Nino. The worship of him declined after Christianization.

===Demigods, heroes, and notable people===
*Amiran (ამირანი) – Mythic hero and titan, son of Dali. Equivalent of the Greek Prometheus.
*Iakhsar (იახსარი) – A mythic hero who aided Kopala in his adventures to slay demons and monsters, and was deified and venerated as a popular deity.
*Ghvtis Shvilni (ღვთის შვილნი, Children of God or Children of Gmerti) – A group of demigods who protected humans, assured good crops and milk yields, fought against devis and kudiani witches. Amiran, Giorgi, Iakhsar, and Kopala were among them, and they fought alongside Iakhsar and Kopala to drive out the devis from the land, and to help Giorgi to raid the impregnable fortress of the kajis to plunder their treasures, cattle, and women.
*Kopala (კოპალა) – A mythic hero, mighty warrior, and demon-killer – also a lightning god. He and Iakhsar lead a campaign to drive underground the devis who are persecuting humans in the middle realm. His weapons include a mace and an iron bow made for him by the blacksmith god Pirkusha (პირქუშა) (with whom compare Ossetian divine smith Kurdalægon and Circassian Tlepsh). He alone has the power to defeat the most stubborn demons, believed to seize a person&#x27;s soul and cause madness, and, by this means, he cures those afflicted by insanity.
*Kviria (კვირია) – A hero and a son of the gods who served as a mediator between Ghmerti and humanity. He is invoked as the protector of human society and an instrument of divine justice. In some regions of Georgia, he was also believed to be a deity of fertility and the harvest, while in the mountains of western Georgia he was worshiped as the supreme deity. The festival of Kviratskholovba (კვირაცხოვლობა) was celebrated to honour him, as also (Marshall Lang surmises) were the erotic and orgiastic cults and festivals, such as the &quot;Berikoba&quot; and &quot;Murqvamoba&quot;, celebrated regularly until recent times among the Pshavs, Khevsurs, Svans and other mountain Georgian tribes. The curious ithyphallic figurines discovered by G.D. Filimonov at the settlement of Kazbek on the Georgian Military Highway may also (Marshall Lang further surmises) relate to erotic aspects of the cult of Kviria. Such figurines have been the subject of much debate among archaeologists and anthropologists and examples continue to come to light in various parts of Georgia, as far east as central Kakhetia, in association with finds of bronze daggers of specific &#x27;Kakhetian type&#x27;, dating to between the thirteenth and eighth centuries B.C.E. Some of these ithyphallic figurines had been designed to be hung from drinking horns.
*Natsiliani (ნაწილიანი) – Humans who received magic gifts or divine signs () from the gods. Their signs are usually located on their shoulder-blades and glow with magic light, empowering their bearers. These signs must be kept hidden, as their bearers will lose their powers if they reveal them.

===Spirits, creatures, and other beings===
*Ali (ალი) – A type of Lilith-like demon that afflicts pregnant women, the elderly, and infants who happen to stumble into remote woods, caves, and ruins. Alis can be male or female (the females being known as &quot;alkali&quot;); male alis generally appear monstrous, while female alis can shift between tempting beauty and hag-like ugliness. Their name may be related to the word for &quot;flame&quot; (ალი). This supernatural being occurs not only in the folklore of the Caucasus, but also in the folk beliefs of Iran, Central Asia and Mongolia and conceptions of its appearance may derive from folk memories of relict hominins (see also Almas (cryptozoology)).
*Devi (დევი) – Many-headed ogres whose heads can regenerate if any of them are cut off (compare Lernaean Hydra). These malevolent giants live in the underworld or in remote mountains, where they hoard treasure troves and keep their captives. In Georgian mythology, they live in a family, consisting usually of nine brothers. Bakbak-Devi (ბაყბაყ-დევი) was the strongest and the most powerful of the devis. To defeat them, heroes would outwit them by means of various tricks and games. Their name (a borrowing into the Kartvelian (language family) Georgian language from Indo-European) is related to that of the daevas of Zoroastrian and Persian mythology, derived in turn from Proto-Indo-European *deiu̯ó &#x27;god&#x27;.
*Dobilni (translation: &#x27;the ones who became sisters&#x27;; დობილნი) – disease-spreading spirits, appearing usually in the form of women, children or animals. Dobilni towers () were built in Khevsurian shrines to keep them at bay. Some Dobilni are benevolent, such as Princess Samdzimar (სამძიმარი) of Khevsureti legend, who is invoked for an easy childbirth, the birth of healthy children, and women&#x27;s health in general. Benevolent Dobilni were also invoked at certain shrines in order to bless cattle and also for the protection of travellers.
*Gveleshapi (, in ancient sources გველ-ვეშაპი – Snake-whale) – Evil serpent that ruled and lived in lakes, rivers, and water sources (compare Nāga). In folklore, they were associated with water-related disasters, and heroes fought against them. (See also Serpent (symbolism).
*Kaji (ქაჯი) – A race of spirits who are often portrayed as magic-wielding, demonic metal-workers ( compare Sons of Ivaldi ). They lived in Kajeti (ქაჯეთი), and had magic powers that they used against humans. Land kajis were malevolent, while river and lake kajis were friendly to humans. Female kajis were beautiful, and they either seduced heroes or helped them in their quests. They appear prominently in Shota Rustaveli&#x27;s &quot;Vepkhistkaosani&quot; (ვეფხისტყაოსანი), in which the Kajis abduct Princess Nestan-Darejan and fight the heroes at Kajeti fortress, although Rustaveli euhemerises them, portraying them, not as a race of supernatural beings, but a tribe of human wizards (albeit wizards of awe-inspiring power). The Kajis also feature in &quot;The Snake-eater&quot; by another celebrated Georgian poet, Vazha-Pshavela, in which they appear as the preparers of a stew of snake-meat that confers occult wisdom on the hero, Mindia (compare The White Snake). Their name is related to the Armenian storm and wind spirits, the kaj (Armenian: քաջ, k&#x27;aǰ; plural: քաջք k&#x27;aǰk&#x27;).
*Kudiani (კუდიანი) – A type of hideous hunchbacked witch, having large teeth and a tail, from the latter of which her name is derived (kudi, კუდი, &quot;tail&quot;). Kudianis can disguise themselves as humans in order to bewitch them. The leader of the kudianis, Rokap (როკაპი), often summons them to a special mountain (compare Brocken, Łysa Góra, Lysa Hora (Kyiv) and Lysa Hora (folklore)) where they hold a festival similar to the European Walpurgis Night.
*Matsil (მაცილი) – Evil spirits from the underworld that plague travelers and hunters. Folk tales refer to Kopala&#x27;s efforts to defeat them.
*Mgebri (მგებრი) - From mountain regions of east Georgia, a spirit of a dying person&#x27;s passed male relative, sent from the afterlife back to the mortal world to be the first to greet their dying family member when they pass. Normally a Mgebri will be the person&#x27;s close family member, most often the mother&#x27;s brothers. The Mgebri appear as young lads, some on horses, some on foot. They have to lead the way into the spirit world, or the deceased person won&#x27;t be able to enter it. 
*Ochokochi (ოჩოკოჩი) – A forest being in Mingrelian folklore who comes into conflict with hunters. Instead of hair on his chest, he has a protuberance in the form of a pointed bone or a stone axe, which he uses to kill passersby by embracing them. He often chases Tkashmapa, the beautiful Queen of the Forest, out of lust, but his uncouth advances are just as often thwarted by mortal hunters (with the worthiest of whom she prefers, on occasion, to mate).
*Paskunji (ფასკუნჯი) – A phoenix-like being who helps heroes and humans. He lives in the underworld, and fights the serpents there. Heroes summoned him by burning one of his feathers, and he could transport them to other places and heal wounds and illnesses. In certain other myths, by contrast, paskunjis are portrayed as being hostile to humans and to have persecuted them.
*Q&#x27;ursha (ყურშა) – A legendary hunting dog associated with various mythological figures including Dali and Amirani.
*Rashi (რაში) – A magical winged horse (compare Pegasus, Buraq, Tulpar, Chollima and Rakhsh). There are three types of rashis: land rashis are well disposed to heroes and humans and could perceive the future; sea rashis are more hostile, but can take humans to the bottom of the sea, while their milk was believed to cure many illnesses; and heavenly rashis have wings and can breathe fire, and are difficult to subdue yet loyal to their owners. Kourkik Challaly, a similar magical, fiery, winged horse plays a large part (as the wise and faithful steed of successive generations of heroes) in the Armenian epic poem Daredevils of Sassoun. Like the sea rashis, Kourkik Challaly is first encountered underwater – in this instance at the bottom of an enchanted lake.
*Rokap (როკაპი) – An evil spirit, leader of the Kudiani (witches). Ghmerti punished him by chaining him to a column under the earth, where he devours human hearts brought to him by the Kudiani . Every year, he tries to free himself, but he always fails.
*T&#x27;q&#x27;ashmapa (ტყაშმაფა) is a forest entity in Mingrelian folklore. In most tales she appears as a pale woman with very long white hair, her dress and accessory (if she wears any) is also all white. She is very strong as well as vicious and violent when displeased. She seeks out men - has a preference for virgin lads - and tries to make them her lovers. Those who refuse will suffer heavy beating and other kinds of physical abuse at her hands.

<doc id="1205183" wikidata="Q318928" url="?curid=1205183" title="Lebanon national football team">
<text>The Lebanon national football team, controlled by the Lebanese Football Association (LFA), have represented Lebanon in association football since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) continentally, and FIFA worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the FIFA World Cup, they have qualified three times to the AFC Asian Cup: they first participated in 2000, when they hosted the event. Lebanon&#x27;s main venue is the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut; however they also play in other locations such as the Saida Municipal Stadium in Sidon.

In 1935, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side CA Timișoara (TAC), but it was not ratified by FIFA. Lebanon played their first FIFA-recognised game in 1940 against Mandatory Palestine. During their 2014 qualification campaign for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the final qualifying round for the first time thanks to a 2–1 victory against South Korea at home in 2011, but failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup finishing bottom of their group. At the 2019 Asian Cup, Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to Vietnam in the third-place ranking on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also compete in the Arab Cup, the WAFF Championship, and the Arab Games. As hosts, they have finished third—once at the Arab Cup and twice at the Arab Games.

Inspired by their national symbol, the Lebanese team is known as &quot;the Cedars&quot; () by fans and media. Their home kit is primarily red and their away kit white, a reference to their national flag. After a steady decline in their FIFA ranking from 1998 to 2016, Lebanon jumped 66 places (from 147th in 2016 to 81st in 2018) and reached their highest rank to date—77th—in September 2018. This came after a 16-game unbeaten streak, from 29 March 2016 to 9 September 2018, during which Lebanon won eight games and drew eight.

==History==
===1933–1957: Formation and early years===
Lebanon was one of the first nations in the Middle East to establish an administrative body for association football. On 22 March 1933, representatives of 13 football clubs gathered in the Minet El Hosn district in Beirut to form the Lebanese Football Association (LFA). The LFA was first headed by Hussein Sejaan, and joined FIFA in 1936.

On 3 February 1934, 22 players from Beirut were called up to a training camp by the LFA in view of a friendly game against the Romanian side CA Timișoara (TAC); the players were divided into two teams, and played against each other at the American University of Beirut&#x27;s (AUB) field. The match against TAC, scheduled to be played on 18 February, was cancelled due to financial disagreements between the LFA and the AUB, who organised the encounter. The Beirut select team eventually played against TAC on 21 November 1935 at AUB&#x27;s field, losing 3–0. Beirut XI played their first game against Syria&#x27;s Damascus XI in 1939 at the Habib Abou Chahla Stadium; the match ended in a 5–4 loss. The two teams played 16 unofficial games until 1963, winning seven, drawing two, and losing seven.
The national team&#x27;s first official FIFA game was a 5–1 loss to Mandatory Palestine on 27 April 1940. Camille Cordahi, assisted by Muhieddine Jaroudi, scored for Lebanon in the second half, becoming his team&#x27;s first official international scorer. Lebanon played their first official game against Syria on 19 April 1942; coached by Abed Traboulsi, Lebanon lost 2–1 in Beirut. In 1947 Lebanon played two more friendlies against Syria: a 4–1 defeat in Beirut on 4 May, and a 1–0 defeat in Aleppo on 18 May.

During the early-1950s, Lebanon were coached by Vinzenz Dittrich and Ljubiša Broćić. The side played five official games between 1953 and 1956, most notably hosting Hungary in 1956. Lebanon lost the match 4–1, with Hungary&#x27;s Ferenc Puskás scoring two goals. The team also played unofficial games against top-level European clubs such as Dynamo Moscow, Leipzig, and Spartak Trnava in 1957. Lebanon played Energia Flacăra Ploiești the same year in the opening game of the Sports City Stadium. The match ended 1–0 for Lebanon thanks to a Joseph Abou Mrad goal.

===1957–1988: Regional competitions and development===
From 19 to 27 October 1957 Lebanon hosted the second edition of the Arab Games, and were drawn with Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Jordan in the group stages. After two 1–1 draws against Saudi Arabia and Syria, Lebanon defeated Jordan 6–3 thanks to two braces by Joseph Abou Mrad and Mardik Tchaparian, and one goal each by Robert Chehade and Levon Altounian; this placed them first in their group. In the semifinals, Lebanon lost 4–2 to Tunisia. They finished in third place, however, since Morocco withdrew from the third-place match.

Joseph Nalbandian was appointed coach of the national team in 1958. He was one of Lebanon&#x27;s most successful coaches, winning nine of 26 official matches during his 11-year tenure. Under Nalbadian, Lebanon hosted the 1959 Mediterranean Games and were grouped with Italy B and Turkey B. They finished last in the group, after four losses to the two European teams.
Lebanon hosted the inaugural edition of the Arab Cup in 1963, and were grouped with Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait, and Jordan. They won their first match against Kuwait 6–0, thanks to a hat-trick by Tchaparian. After another win (against Jordan) and two losses (to Syria and Tunisia), Lebanon finished third in the tournament. In the 1966 edition, Lebanon were drawn with Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, and Bahrain in Group A. After three wins and a draw, they qualified to the semi-finals against Syria, where they lost 1–0. In the third-place match, Lebanon lost 6–1 to Libya, finishing the competition in fourth place. Lebanon had also played at the 1964 Tripoli Fair Tournament; in a group with Libya, Sudan, Morocco, and Malta, they finished in first place with seven points.

Having joined the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1964, Lebanon&#x27;s first Asian Cup qualifying campaign was in 1971, coached by Joseph Abou Mrad. In the first round they lost to hosts Kuwait 1–0, but defeated neighbours Syria 3–2 to qualify for the next round. In a decisive semi-final match against Iraq, Lebanon lost 4–1 and were eliminated.

Despite the country&#x27;s civil war, Lebanon appeared in the 1980 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers held in Abu Dhabi; with one win, one draw, and one defeat, the team came third in their group and were eliminated. Lebanon also initially took part in the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers; however, after playing four matches, Lebanon withdrew and their results were annulled. In the 1988 Arab Cup, Lebanon were drawn with Egypt, Iraq, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. They finished third in their group, with one win, two draws, and one defeat.

===1993–2004: Post-war era and Asian Cup hosts===
In 1993, Lebanon competed in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers, their first qualification campaign after the civil war, with Adnan Al Sharqi as their coach. Their gap of 57 years between the date of FIFA affiliation (1936) and their first full World Cup qualifying campaign (1993) was the highest to date; it was surpassed by the Philippines three years later with a gap of 68 years. After two wins, two losses, and four draws, Lebanon finished third in their group and were eliminated. Under Terry Yorath, the team&#x27;s first foreign manager since the war, Lebanon began their first post-war campaign to qualify for the 1996 Asian Cup. Despite winning twice against Turkmenistan and losing only once (at home, against Kuwait), Lebanon were eliminated from the competition with a one-point difference with Kuwait (the group leader).

Yorath helped Lebanon gain 10 places in the FIFA World Ranking thanks to a 3–3 draw against the Czech Republic and a 1–0 win against Jordan, both friendlies played in February 1997. Thanks to their performances, Lebanon were awarded the Asian Team of the Month award in February. Lebanon were drawn in a group which included Kuwait and Singapore in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, played between April and June 1997. Led by Yorath, the Cedars were eliminated with only four points. Despite the team&#x27;s elimination, the Welsh manager was one of the team&#x27;s most successful managers, winning 13 of 31 official matches during his two-year tenure.
Lebanon hosted the 2000 Asian Cup, despite FIFA&#x27;s concerns about stadium conditions. Under Croatian coach Josip Skoblar, Lebanon, captained by Jamal Taha, drew into Group A with Iran, Iraq, and Thailand. Out of the 23 called-up players for the tournament, five were Brazilians with Lebanese ancestry.

Lebanon played their first Asian Cup game against Iran on 12 October 2000 at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium with 52,418 spectators. Trailing by one goal at half time, Lebanon conceded three further goals in the second half to end their first group stage match in a 4–0 defeat. In the second match, against Iraq, two goals in the first 22 minutes gave the opposing team a comfortable lead. However, an Abbas Chahrour long-distance volley in the 28th minute, Lebanon&#x27;s first goal in the competition, and a goal by Moussa Hojeij in the 76th minute gave Lebanon their first point of the competition. Lebanon played Thailand in the final group stage match. With the opposing team gaining the lead in the 58th minute, Luís Fernandes equalised for Lebanon to end the match 1–1. The draw was not enough as they finished last in the group, with only two points.

Managed by Theo Bücker, Lebanon drew with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Thailand in the first round of the 2002 World Cup qualifications. The team, with good offense from Roda Antar, Haitham Zein, Vartan Ghazarian, and Gilberto dos Santos, finished second in their group with 26 goals in six games (the most in their group).

Under Richard Tardy, Lebanon drew into Group D of the 2004 Asian Cup qualifiers. Before the match away to North Korea, the Lebanese team were reportedly ill-treated; hotel conditions were poor, and their training field contained goats and sheep. Lebanon finished third in their group, with four points. For the second round of the qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup, Lebanon were grouped with South Korea, Vietnam, and the Maldives. Under Mahmoud Hamoud, they finished second in their group and were eliminated.

===2006–2014: Final round of World Cup qualification and match fixing===
Lebanon drew into Group D for the 2007 Asian Cup qualifying campaign with Australia, Bahrain, and Kuwait, played in 2006. The scheduled meeting between Australia and Lebanon made Buddy Farah, an Australian player of Lebanese descent, declare his return to the Lebanese national side. Before Lebanon&#x27;s match with Bahrain on 16 August, it was announced on 1 August that the Asian Football Confederation had accepted a withdrawal request from the Lebanon Football Association due to the 2006 Lebanon War, which forced several players to leave their homes to avoid the war. In 2007 Lebanon was seeded in the first round of the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup, where they faced India to qualify directly for the third round of the qualifiers. Lebanon won 6–3 on aggregate and advanced to the third round, with two goals by Mohammed Ghaddar in the second match. Lebanon, grouped with Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Uzbekistan, finished last with no points.

In April 2008, Lebanon and the Maldives (the two lowest-ranked teams in Asia) played home-and-away matches in the preliminary round of the 2011 Asian Cup; the winner would proceed to the next round. A 4–0 home win and a 2–1 victory in the away match advanced Lebanon to the qualifying round. Between 2009 and 2010, they drew into Group D with China, Syria, and Vietnam, finishing last. Emile Rustom, re-appointed as head coach in November 2008, led Lebanon into the second round of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers. They faced Bangladesh, winning 4–0 in Beirut on 23 July 2011, and losing 2–0 in Dhaka five days later. Lebanon advanced to the third round, where they were grouped with South Korea, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Rustom resigned less than a week later, citing internal administrative problems.

On 4 August 2011, Theo Bücker was reappointed as Lebanon&#x27;s head coach. The former national team manager took the reins nine years after leaving that position. Lebanon began the third round losing 6–0 away to South Korea. In the second match, they came back from one goal down to defeat the UAE 3–1 at home. The team then drew 2–2 to Kuwait in Beirut on 11 October. For the first time since 2005, when the LFA barred fans from the stadiums due to behavioural issues, spectators (32,000) were allowed at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. Bad fan behaviour (mainly fireworks-related) was again a problem against Kuwait, forcing referee Masaaki Toma to stop the game several times. A month later, Lebanon defeated Kuwait 1–0 in Kuwait City; it was Kuwait&#x27;s first home loss to Lebanon. On 15 November, Lebanon hosted South Korea at Beirut&#x27;s Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium before over 40,000 spectators. Ali Al Saadi gave Lebanon the lead after four minutes, however South Korea tied the score with a penalty kick. Lebanon regained the lead in the 30th minute through an Abbas Ali Atwi penalty; the match finished in a 2–1 victory. Lebanon&#x27;s first-ever win against South Korea qualified them for the fourth (and final) round of the World Cup qualifiers for the first time.
In 2012 Lebanon drew into Group A of the fourth round, with South Korea, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Qatar. In Lebanon&#x27;s fourth game, on 11 September against Iran, a first-half Roda Antar goal gave Lebanon the lead through a header. They held onto the lead and won 1–0; the three points were crucial to stay in contention for a spot at the 2014 World Cup. On 26 February 2013, team members Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud El Ali were involved in the 2013 Lebanese match-fixing scandal; they were accused of illegal betting on several matches involving Lebanese teams (including the national team), in addition to manipulating results. The players were fined $15,000 and banned from the Lebanon Football Association for life. Lebanon&#x27;s 1–0 defeat to Qatar was part of the scandal, with defender Dayoub purposely passing the ball to the Qatari striker, who netted the only goal of the game. The Lebanese team then lost to Uzbekistan 1–0 on the road. In the following match they hosted South Korea in Beirut and led 1–0, until South Korea scored the equaliser in the 97th minute, eliminating Lebanon.

In 2013 the team drew into group B with Iran, Thailand and Kuwait for the 2015 Asian Cup qualifications. After losing 5–0 to Iran, and winning 5–2 against Thailand, Giuseppe Giannini replaced Theo Bücker as head coach. During Giannini&#x27;s first game, on match day three, Mohammad Ghaddar scored the equaliser against Kuwait in Beirut to earn a point for Lebanon. Lebanon ended the qualifications in third place in their group, with two wins, two draws, and two losses. Lebanon and China were tied on points in the ranking of third-places teams; China had a better goal difference, however, and went on to play in the final tournament.

After the country&#x27;s failed attempt to qualify for the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia, the Lebanese Football Association decided to reform the national team in 2014 by modeling it on the Belgium national team (particularly Belgium&#x27;s performance in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil). Inviting new players from nations with a large Lebanese community (such as the United States, Germany, Denmark, and Norway) would, it was hoped, bring about a rebirth of Lebanese football. On 8 September 2014, Lebanon played an unofficial FIFA match against the Brazilian Olympic team in Doha for the first time; the match ended in a 2–2 draw. Hassan Maatouk scored a goal which would have given Lebanon a 3–1 lead, but the goal was incorrectly ruled offside; Brazil&#x27;s equalising goal was erroneously ruled onside. The match excited the Lebanese people, despite poor refereeing. After Lebanon&#x27;s 5–0 away loss to Qatar a month later, Giuseppe Giannini was fired.

===2015–2019: Continued development and first Asian Cup qualification===

Miodrag Radulović was appointed the team&#x27;s new coach in 2015, and led Lebanon in the 2018 World Cup qualifications, played between June 2015 and March 2016. The team were drawn in a group that included Asia&#x27;s runners-up South Korea, Kuwait, Myanmar, and Laos, the second time Lebanon faced South Korea and Kuwait in World Cup qualifiers. Lebanon finished second in the group and, although they were eliminated from the World Cup, they qualified to the 2019 Asian Cup qualification third round, played between March 2017 and March 2018.

The Asian Cup draw put Lebanon in Group B, with North Korea, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. With five wins and a draw, Lebanon topped the group and qualified for the cup for the first time (after qualifying as host in 2000, the country&#x27;s only previous participation). Hassan Maatouk (who succeeded Roda Antar as captain in 2016) was key to Lebanon&#x27;s success, scoring five goals in six games. Although Radulović failed to qualify the team for the 2018 World Cup, he helped Lebanon reach their first-ever Asian Cup through qualification in 2019; he was the first Montenegrin manager to help a team qualify for a major tournament. Radulović managed a 16-game unbeaten streak (from 29 March 2016 to 9 September 2018), winning eight and drawing eight, making Lebanon the second-most unbeaten national team by number of games at that point (16) after Spain (26). In September 2018, Lebanon achieved their best-ever FIFA ranking (77th).

Lebanon relied on their diaspora abroad for the 2019 Asian Cup, with nine of their 23 called-up players being born outside Lebanon. They started the campaign on 9 January 2019, with a 2–0 loss against Qatar. In the 37th minute, Ali Hamam scored a goal for Lebanon from a corner, only for it to be controversially disallowed for a foul. Two goals by Qatar in the second half secured all three points for the opposing team. Three days later, Lebanon played their second match of the tournament against Saudi Arabia. Two goals without reply brought Lebanon their second defeat of the tournament.

In the final group stage game against North Korea, played on 17 January, Lebanon needed to win by four goals to pass to the knock-out stages. The encounter ended in a 4–1 win, thanks to a brace by Hilal El-Helwe, which gave Lebanon their first ever Asian Cup win. However, they lost out to Vietnam in the third-place ranking on the fair play rule. Because they had received seven yellow cards against five by Vietnam, they were knocked out of the competition.

Liviu Ciobotariu was appointed for the joint qualifications for the 2022 World Cup and the 2023 Asian Cup. His first games took place at the 2019 WAFF Championship, where Lebanon were drawn with hosts Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Yemen. Lebanon finished fourth in their group with four points, after a win, a draw, and two defeats.

For the second round of qualification for the 2022 World Cup, Lebanon were drawn with South Korea, for the third time in a row, North Korea, who Lebanon had faced in both the qualifications and final stage of the 2019 Asian Cup, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka. Lebanon played five matches (two wins, two draws, and one defeat) between September and November 2019, before the remaining games were postponed on 9 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia.

===2020–2024: Post-COVID era and 2023 Asian Cup===

Former national team captain Jamal Taha was appointed head coach in summer 2020. North Korea withdrew from the World Cup qualifiers in May 2021, and their previous results were voided; this highly benefited Lebanon, as they had only gained one point in two games against them. Despite only winning only one of their following three games, other results went in Lebanon&#x27;s favour and they finished among the best runners-up, qualifying to the 2023 Asian Cup for the third time, and the final round of 2022 World Cup qualification for the second time.

Lebanon played in Group A of the final round of qualification under coach Ivan Hašek between September 2021 and March 2022, and were drawn with Iran, South Korea, the UAE, Iraq and Syria. Having earned five points in the first four games (all away from home), most notably via a 3–2 win against Syria, the team was noted as an &quot;early surprise&quot;, sitting in the play-off qualifying third place as the lowest-ranked team in the round. In the remaining six games (including five at home), Lebanon earned only one point and finished in last place with six points. The qualification campaign was partially covered by &quot;Captains&quot;, a docuseries released by FIFA and Netflix following six national teams and their respective captains in their 2022 World Cup qualification runs.

Between June and September 2023, Lebanon took part in various friendly tournaments in preparation ahead of the upcoming 2023 Asian Cup. The team finished runners-up in the 2023 Intercontinental Cup – losing 2–0 to hosts India in the final, reached the semi-finals of the 2023 SAFF Championship – also losing to hosts India on penalties, and finished in third place in the 2023 King&#x27;s Cup – defeating India 1–0.

Radulović was re-appointed head coach of Lebanon ahead of the 2023 Asian Cup, played in January 2024. They were drawn with hosts Qatar, China and Tajikistan in Group A. Lebanon played the opening game of the Asian Cup on 12 January in front of 82,490 spectators at the Lusail Stadium, which had hosted the 2022 World Cup final 13 months prior. Qatar comfortably won the encounter 3–0. Lebanon faced China five days later in a goalless draw. On 22 January, Lebanon headed into the final game against Tajikistan needing a win to progress. Lebanon&#x27;s Bassel Jradi gave them the lead early in the second half; however, Kassem El Zein&#x27;s red card reduced them to 10 men in the 52nd minute. Tajikistan scored twice late in the game and knocked Lebanon out of the competition, who finished last in their group with only one point.

Lebanon was drawn in Group I of the second round of qualification for the 2026 World Cup, alongside Australia, Palestine and Bangladesh. Played between November 2023 and June 2024, Lebanon won once, drew three times and lost twice. Despite not qualifying for the next round of World Cup qualification, Lebanon&#x27;s third-place finish advanced them to the final round of qualification for the 2027 Asian Cup. The World Cup qualifiers were also the last games of Lebanon&#x27;s captain Hassan Maatouk, who retired as the team&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer and most-capped player with 26 goals in 123 games.

==Team image==

===Nickname===
Lebanon is known as &quot;the Cedars&quot; () by fans and the media, since the cedar tree is the country&#x27;s national symbol.

===Kits===

The national team traditionally wear red as their primary colour and white as their secondary colour. The choices originate from the national flag of Lebanon (red, white, and green); green is sometimes reserved for the goalkeeper. At home, Lebanon usually wear a red shirt, shorts, and socks, with white details; the away kit is a white outfit with red details.

During their first unofficial match in 1935, Lebanon wore white shirts with the Lebanese cedar and the association&#x27;s name on the chest, black shorts, and white socks; the goalkeeper wore a black shirt and white trousers. In 1940, on the occasion of their first FIFA-sanctioned game against Mandatory Palestine, Lebanon wore a white kit with a black collar, along with black shorts and striped socks. During the 1960s, Lebanon wore a red shirt with a white horizontal band in the center, which included a green cedar tree in the middle; the shorts were white, and the socks were red-and-white-striped.

In the 2000 Asian Cup, Lebanon wore a red Adidas shirt with white details on the sides and a white collar, white shorts, and red socks. In the 2019 campaign, Lebanon wore a red kit with white details and a white collar, manufactured by Capelli Sport, a sports brand founded by Lebanese-born entrepreneur George Altirs. The Lebanese cedar, the country&#x27;s national symbol, was present under the team logo in a darker shade of red. Since 2023, the team kit has been manufactured by Kelme. Previous manufacturers include Diadora and Adidas.

===Home stadium===
The Lebanese national team play their home games in various stadiums throughout the country. The team&#x27;s main venue is the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium. Built in 1957 during the presidency of Camille Chamoun, it is the country&#x27;s largest stadium with 49,500 seats. Its inaugural game was in 1957, when the national team played Energia Flacara Ploiesti and won 1–0 thanks to a Joseph Abou Mrad goal. It was the main stadium used to host the 2000 Asian Cup held in Lebanon; six matches were played in the stadium including the opening match and the final. In 2011 the stadium hosted the famed 2–1 victory against South Korea in the 2014 World Cup qualification, sending Lebanon to the final round of qualification for the first time. Over 40,000 spectators were present to watch the match.

The national team, however, also play in other stadiums such as the Saida Municipal Stadium located in Sidon. Built over the sea, the stadium holds 22,600 people, and was one of the venues to host the 2000 Asian Cup. Other stadiums in which the national team play include the Tripoli Municipal Stadium and the Beirut Municipal Stadium.

===Media===
Produced by Fulwell 73, FIFA released &quot;Captains&quot; in 2022, an eight-part sports docuseries following six national team captains in their respective 2022 World Cup qualification campaigns. Hassan Maatouk, representing Lebanon, starred in the first season alongside Thiago Silva (Brazil), Luka Modrić (Croatia), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Gabon), Andre Blake (Jamaica) and Brian Kaltak (Vanuatu). It was released by Netflix, and also shown on FIFA&#x27;s own streaming platform, FIFA+.

===FIFA World Cup===

Although the Lebanese Football Association was formed in 1933, Lebanon&#x27;s first qualification campaign for the FIFA World Cup took place in the 1986 edition. However, after playing four matches, Lebanon withdrew due to the ongoing civil war, and their results were subsequently annulled. The country&#x27;s first full qualification campaign came two editions later, in 1994, where they finished third in their group with two wins, four draws, and two losses. Ever since, Lebanon have participated in every iteration of the World Cup qualifiers.

Lebanon first reached the final round of World Cup qualification during the 2014 campaign. After beating Bangladesh 4–2 on aggregate in the second round, Lebanon qualified to the third round, where they were drawn with South Korea, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. The team beat South Korea in a historic 2–1 win at home, coming second in their group and qualifying to the fourth (and final) round for the first time. Grouped with Iran, South Korea, Uzbekistan, and Qatar, Lebanon finished last in Group A and were eliminated with only one win and two draws in eight games.

===AFC Asian Cup===
Lebanon&#x27;s first qualification campaign for the Asian Cup came at the 1972 edition; drawn in Group B of the Western Zone, Lebanon came second thanks to a 3–2 victory over neighbors Syria and advanced to the next stage. In the decisive semi-final match against Iraq, Lebanon lost 4–1 and were knocked-out. Lebanon won a consolatory third-place match against Jordan.

The 2000 edition was Lebanon&#x27;s first participation in the finals, when the country hosted the event. Following a 4–0 defeat to Iran in the competition&#x27;s opening match, Lebanon came from behind to draw 2–2 against Iraq; Abbas Chahrour became Lebanon&#x27;s first goalscorer in the competition. Lebanon drew once again, 1–1 against Thailand, and were eliminated, finishing last in the group.

After finishing the 2019 third round of qualification unbeaten, Lebanon qualified to the Asian Cup for the first time in their history. In the finals, Lebanon lost the first group stage match 2–0 to eventual champions Qatar, before losing once again by the same score to Saudi Arabia. In the final match of the group, Lebanon needed a win by four goals or more against North Korea to qualify to the knock-out stage. Despite conceding an early free-kick goal, Lebanon went on to win the match 4–1 thanks to a brace by Hilal El-Helwe. However, they lost out to Vietnam in the third-place ranking due to having received more yellow cards, and were knocked out of the competition.

===FIFA Arab Cup===

Lebanon have taken part in all iterations of the Arab Cup, except the 1985 and 1992 editions. They hosted the inaugural edition in 1963, in a group containing Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait, and Jordan. After beating Kuwait 6–0 through a hat-trick by Mardik Tchaparian, Lebanon lost 3–2 to Syria, before winning 5–0 against Jordan. In a decisive match against Tunisia, Muhieddine Itani scored an own goal, and Lebanon lost 1–0, finishing third.

Lebanon finished in fourth place in the subsequent two editions (1964 and 1966); ever since, they have failed to pass the group stage.
===WAFF Championship===
Bar the 2008 and 2010 editions, Lebanon have participated in every WAFF Championship; they have failed to qualify past the group stage on all occasions. Their first participation in the WAFF Championship was in 2000, at the inaugural edition. Drawn with Iraq, hosts Jordan, and Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon finished third in their group with one win, one draw, and one loss.

===Summer Olympic Games===

Lebanon&#x27;s senior team have never qualified to the Summer Olympics final tournament; their first qualification campaign was for Rome 1960. After losing the first two group stage games against Iraq, Lebanon withdrew and the two remaining matches were awarded to their opponent Turkey. Lebanon participated in two more qualifications, in 1968 and 1972, failing to qualify to the final tournament on both occasions. Starting from the 1992 edition, the Olympic Football Tournament has been reserved for national under-23 teams.

===Asian Games===
The Lebanon national senior team only participated once at the Asian Games, at Bangkok 1998. Thanks to a 5–1 win against Cambodia, Lebanon qualified past the preliminary round and were drawn with Qatar, Thailand, and Kazakhstan in the second round. Following two 1–0 defeats, respectively to Qatar and Thailand, Lebanon won 3–0 against Kazakhstan in their final encounter of the group stage. However, the three points weren&#x27;t enough to qualify Lebanon to the knockout round.

===Arab Games===
After participating in the inaugural edition of the Arab Games, at Alexandria 1953, Lebanon hosted the 1957 edition. Topping a group containing Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, Lebanon reached the semi-finals where they lost 4–2 to Tunisia. Due to Morocco withdrawing from the third-place match, Lebanon finished the tournament in third place. Lebanon also came third in 1997, once again as hosts. With two draws and a win, Lebanon came second in their group and qualified to the semi-finals, which they lost after extra time to Syria. Lebanon finished in third place after beating Kuwait 3–1.

===Mediterranean Games===
Lebanon&#x27;s first participation at the Mediterranean Games was in 1959, when they hosted the event. They lost both legs against Italy and Turkey, finishing last with no points. Lebanon&#x27;s senior team participated two more times, in 1963 and 1987, failing to qualify past the group stage on both occasions.

===Other tournaments===
Lebanon won their first tournament—albeit unofficial—at the 1964 Tripoli Fair Tournament; with three wins and one draw, Lebanon finished first in a group containing Libya, Morocco, Sudan, and Malta. In 1998, Lebanon participated at the Friendship Tournament in the United Arab Emirates where, with two draws and a defeat, they finished in third place out of four. Lebanon also finished in third place at the 2009 King&#x27;s Cup in Thailand; after losing to the hosts in the semi-finals, they won against North Korea in the third-place match.

<text>The Royal African Company (RAC) was an English trading company established in 1660 by the House of Stuart and City of London merchants to trade along the West African coast. It was overseen by the Duke of York, the brother of Charles II of England; the RAC was founded after Charles II ascended to the English throne in the 1660 Stuart Restoration, and he granted it a monopoly on all English trade with Africa. While the company&#x27;s original purpose was to trade for gold in the Gambia River, as Prince Rupert of the Rhine had identified gold deposits in the region during the Interregnum, the RAC quickly began trading in slaves, who became its largest commodity. 

Historians have estimated that the RAC shipped more African slaves to the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade than any other company. The RAC also dealt in other commodities such as ivory, which were primarily sourced from the Gold Coast region. After William III of England rescinded the company&#x27;s monopoly in 1697 under pressure from the Parliament of England, the RAC became insolvent by 1708, though it survived in a state of much reduced activity until 1752, when its assets were transferred to the newly founded African Company of Merchants, which lasted until 1821.

==History==
===Background===
On the west coast of Africa the few Europeans lived in fortified factories (trading posts). They had no sovereignty over the land or its natives, and very little immunity to tropical diseases. The coastal tribes acted as intermediaries between them and the slave-hunters of the interior. There was little incentive for European men to explore up the rivers, and few of them did so. The atmosphere might have been one of quiet routine for the traders had there not been acute rivalries between the European powers; especially the Dutch, who made use of native allies against their rivals. Before the Restoration, the Dutch had been the main suppliers of slaves to the English West Indian plantations, but it was part of the policy of the English Navigation Acts to oust them from this lucrative trade. Between 1676 and 1700, the value of gold exports from Africa was similar to the total value of slave exports. After the Peace of Ryswick in 1697, the price of slaves in Africa and the number of slaves exported doubled; from then, until trade diminished after 1807, slaves were clearly the most valuable export of Africa.

===Company of Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa===

Originally known as the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading into Africa, by its charter issued on 18 December 1660 it was granted a monopoly over English trade along the west coast of Africa, with the principal objective being the search for gold. The company was to be run by a committee of six: the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Craven, George Caveret, Ellis Leighton and Cornelius Vermuyden.

In 1663, a new charter was obtained which also mentioned the trade in slaves. This was the third English African Company, but it made a fresh start in the slave trade and there was only one factory of importance for it to take over from the East India Company, which had leased it as a calling-place on the sea-route round the Cape. This was Cormantin, a few miles east of the Dutch station of Cape Coast Castle, now in Ghana. The 1663 charter prohibits others to trade in &quot;redwood, elephants&#x27; teeth, negroes, slaves, hides, wax, guinea grains, or other commodities of those countries&quot;. 
In 1663, as a prelude to the Dutch war, Captain Holmes&#x27;s expedition captured or destroyed all the Dutch settlements on the coast, and in 1664, Fort James was founded on an island about twenty miles up the Gambia river, as a new centre for English trade and power. This, however, was only the beginning of a series of captures and recaptures. In the same year, de Ruyter won back all the Dutch forts except Cape Coast Castle and also took Cormantin. In 1667, the Treaty of Breda confirmed Cape Coast Castle to the English.

Forts served as staging and trading stations, and the company was responsible for seizing any English ships that attempted to operate in violation of its monopoly (known as interlopers). In the &quot;prize court&quot;, the King received half of the proceeds and the company half from the seizure of these interlopers.

The company fell heavily into debt in 1667, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. For several years after that, the company maintained some desultory trade, including licensing single-trip private traders, but its biggest effort was the creation in 1668 of the Gambia Adventurers. This new company was separately subscribed and granted a ten-year licence for African trade north of the Bight of Benin with effect from 1 January 1669. At the end of 1678, the licence to the Gambia Adventurers expired and its Gambian trade was merged into the company.

===Royal African Company of England===
The African Company was ruined by its losses and surrendered its charter in 1672, to be followed by the still more ambitious Royal African Company of England. Its new charter was broader than the old one and included the right to set up forts and factories, maintain troops, and exercise martial law in West Africa, in pursuit of trade in &quot;gold, silver, negroes, slaves, goods, wares and merchandises whatsoever&quot;. Until 1687, the company was very prosperous. It set up six forts on the Gold Coast, and another post at Ouidah, farther east on the Slave Coast, which became its principal centre for trade. Cape Coast Castle was strengthened and rose to be second in importance only to the Dutch factory at Elmina. Anglo-Dutch rivalry was, however, henceforward unimportant in the region and the Dutch were not strong enough to take aggressive measures here in the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

===Slave trade===

In the 1680s, the company was transporting about 5,000 enslaved people a year to markets primarily in the Caribbean across the Atlantic. Many were branded with the letters &quot;DoY&quot;, for its Governor, the Duke of York, who succeeded his brother on the throne in 1685, becoming King James II. Other slaves were branded with the company&#x27;s initials, RAC, on their chests. Historian William Pettigrew has stated that this company &quot;shipped more enslaved African women, men and children to the Americas than any other single institution during the entire period of the transatlantic slave trade&quot;, and that investors in the company were fully aware of its activities and intended to profit from this exploitation.

Between 1672 and 1731, the Royal African Company transported 187,697 enslaved people on company-owned ships (653 voyages) to English colonies in the Americas. Of those transported, 38,497 enslaved people died en route. The predecessor Company of Royal Adventurers (1662–1672) transported 26,925 enslaved people on company-owned ships (104 voyages), of whom 6,620 died during the passage.

===Later activities and insolvency===
From 1694 to 1700, the company was a major participant in the Komenda Wars in the port city Komenda in the Eguafo Kingdom in modern-day Ghana. The company allied with a merchant prince named John Cabess and various neighbouring African kingdoms to depose the king of Eguafo and establish a permanent fort and factory in Komenda. The English took two French forts and lost them again, after which the French destroyed Fort James. The place appears to have been soon regained and in the War of Spanish Succession to have been twice retaken by the French. In the treaty of Utrecht it remained English. The French wars caused considerable losses to the company.

In 1689, the company acknowledged that it had lost its monopoly with the end of royal power in the Glorious Revolution, and it ceased issuing letters of marque. Edward Colston transferred a large segment of his original shareholding to William III at the beginning of 1689, securing the new regime&#x27;s favour. To maintain the company and its infrastructure and end its monopoly, parliament passed the Trade with Africa Act 1697 (9 Will. 3 c. 26). Among other provisions, the Act opened the African trade to all English merchants who paid a ten per cent levy to the company on all goods exported from Africa.

The company was unable to withstand competition on the terms imposed by the Act and in 1708 became insolvent, surviving until 1750 in a state of much reduced activity. In 1709 Charles Davenant published &quot;Reflections upon the Constitution and Management of Trade to Africa&quot;, in which he &quot;reverted to his normal attitude of suspicion and outright hostility towards the Dutch.&quot; This pamphlet advocated renewing the Royal African Company&#x27;s monopoly on slave trade on the basis that the Dutch competition &quot;necessitated the maintenance of forts, which only a joint-stock company could afford.&quot;

The company continued purchasing and transporting slaves until 1731, when it abandoned slaving in favour of ivory and gold dust.

From 1668 to 1722, the Royal African Company provided gold to the English Mint. Coins made with such gold are designed with an elephant below the bust of the king and/or queen. This gold also gave the coinage its name, the guinea.

==Members and officials==

* Edward Colston (1636–1721), merchant, philanthropist, and Member of Parliament, was a shareholder in the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692; from 1689 to 1690 he was its Deputy Governor, a senior executive position, the basis on which he is described as a slave trader.
* Charles Hayes (1678–1760), mathematician and chronologer, was sub-governor of the Royal African Company in 1752, when it was dissolved.
* Malachy Postlethwayt, director and propagandist of the company.

<doc id="1205207" wikidata="Q6291505" url="?curid=1205207" title="José Antonio Salcedo">
<text>General José Antonio Salcedo y Ramírez, known as &quot;Pepillo&quot; (1816 – November 5, 1864) was Dominican military leader who played a fundamental role in the Dominican Restoration War, which achieved the independence from Spain in 1865. A martyr, he was the first Dominican head of state to be assassinated in the history of the Dominican Republic. 

== Early life ==
Salcedo was born in Madrid, Spain from Criollo (white creole) parents of Spanish heritage who had been stationed in Spain for over a year, as part of the traditional Grand Tour of rich Latin American Criollos to Spain.

The names of his parents were José María Salcedo and Luisa Ramírez y Marichal, both Cuban-born Dominicans (many Dominicans fled the island due to the Napoleonic Wars, the Haitian Revolution and the political instability from 1795 to 1809: about 4,000 went to Cuba and 100,000 did so to Venezuela while scores exiled in Puerto Rico and Mexico; many Dominicans and their foreign-born children eventually returned to the island).

Leaving Spain, the family returned to Cuba when Salcedo was a year old before settling in the lands of their ancestors in the Cibao valley. He grew up near the border of Haiti where he managed large tracts of land, herds of livestock, and a rich timber business in the towns of Hatillo Palma, Estero Balsa, and Botoncillo in the northwest.

In 1844, when the First Dominican Republic was proclaimed, he joined the ranks of the Dominican Army and participated in the bloody battles of the Dominican War of Independence. He was said to have taken part In the Battle of Beler, in 1845, and the Battle of Sabana Larga, in 1856. He attained the rank of colonel for his services. 

== Civil war and presidency ==
Salcedo led a civil war which aimed at the restoration of the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Restoration War began on August 16, 1863, and by September 14, 1863 a Provisional Government was established, over which the general presided.

After he became the 1st head of state of the Dominican Republic, the general was opposed by the Nationalist movement, who viewed his policies as favoring those supporting the annexation of the country.

== Assassination ==
On October 15, 1864, Head of State Salcedo sent word to his wife (who lived in Guayubín) about the opposition, with a young soldier who was nearly in his mid-twenties named Ulises Heureaux. Later on the same day, he was assassinated by Coronel Agustín Masagó by order of General Gaspar Polanco.

== Personal life ==
Salcedo married Águeda Rodríguez of Guayubín, Monte Cristi. Together they had at least four children: José Tomás (born 1841 and married Rosa Elvira Brea in 1869), Antonia (born 1846), Cristina (born 1851), and Julia (married Rosendo Batista in 1888) Salcedo y Rodríguez. Antonia Salcedo married and had a daughter with another Restoration figure, Dionisio Troncoso (1834–1891), named Antonia María Troncoso y Salcedo. A great granddaughter of Pepillo, Genoveva Cruz, was 95 in 2017.She is still alive and celebrated her 101 birthday, I know this as she is my aunt grandmother, her sister Ana Mercedes Cruz was my grandmother. The descendants of Pepillo Salcedo are many.

== Honors ==
The town of Pepillo Salcedo, in Monte Cristi province, was named in his honor.

<doc id="1205219" wikidata="Q7550505" url="?curid=1205219" title="Social Credit Party of Ontario">
<text>The Social Credit Party of Ontario (SCPO) (also known as the Ontario Social Credit League, Social Credit Association of Ontario and the Union of Electors) was a minor political party at the provincial level in the Canadian province of Ontario from the 1940s to the early 1970s. The party never won any seats in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. It was affiliated with the Social Credit Party of Canada and espoused social credit theories of monetary reform.

==1940s and 1950s and early 1960s==
Social Credit appears to have been inactive in Ontario until 1945 when eight candidates stood in the province for the federal party in the 1945 federal election. The Ontario Social Credit party ran three candidates in the 1945 provincial election.

In 1946, the Ontario Social Credit movement split as a result of Ernest Manning&#x27;s growing hostility to Douglasites and anti-Semites in the movement.

The official Ontario Social Credit League was headed by John J. Fitzgerald and William Ovens. Ron Gostick, a far right propagandist, established the Union of Electors as a rival organization inspired by the more radical Quebec social credit organization, &quot;Union des electeurs&quot; led by Louis Even.

Like Even&#x27;s group, the Union rejected the party system and ran not as a partisan political party but as a citizen&#x27;s organization compelling their elected representatives to represent the will of the people. Like the Quebec-based Union, it also believed in a more orthodox application of social credit economic theory and was more openly anti-Semitic. In October 1947, the Ontario Social Credit League held an emergency convention which repudiated Gostick and the Union for infringing the League&#x27;s rights.

In the 1948 provincial election, the official Social Credit League ran no candidates but the &quot;Union of Electors&quot; ran fifteen candidates. The Ontario Union of Electors was accused by the Toronto Labour Council of &quot;disseminating racial hatred in its crudest form.&quot;

Both parties then went dormant running no candidates in the 1951 or 1955 provincial elections, though Mel Rowat ran as an &quot;Independent Social Credit&quot; candidate in 1955 in Stormont. The federal party continued to run candidates in Ontario during federal elections throughout the 1950s. In the 1959 provincial election the Social Credit party ran five candidates under the leadership of Edgar Shipley Birrell. Birrell, a Toronto furrier, Social Credit member since 1944, and Leaside town councillor from 1955 to 1960 had been elected party leader in February 1959, and stood as the party&#x27;s candidate in York East Birrell remained party leader until March 1962. Philip Kelly, a former minister of mines in the Ontario government of Leslie Frost, was elected the party&#x27;s leader in March 1962 but quit several months later over a policy dispute.

==1963 schism==

In 1963, the party split into two factions. &quot;Social Credit Action&quot; was established by Neil Carmichael, a stamp and coin dealer, who was chosen the group&#x27;s leader, Carmichael&#x27;s membership in the Ontario Social Credit Party had not been renewed after he made anti-Semitic statements. Other founders of the splinter group were James Audy, an accountant, who became party president, and David Hartman of Toronto. The group was formed when the official party refused to actively campaign in the 1963 provincial election. Audy had been the federal Social Credit Party&#x27;s candidate in Spadina riding in the previous election.

Carmichael, 45, a five-time federal Socred candidate, had been the focus of controversy earlier that year when he was a federal Social Credit candidate in St. Paul&#x27;s. He asserted at a public meeting that there was a Jewish conspiracy in which the Rothschilds were plotting to acquire all of Canada&#x27;s mines through non-Jewish third party operatives, and that the family was part of an international Jewish conspiracy to take over all of Canada&#x27;s businesses. Carmichael was cautioned by the Social Credit Party of Ontario that he was &quot;skating on thin ice&quot; and would not be permitted to stand as a candidate again. His promise that a Social Credit government would pay each Canadian $5,000 worth of goods and services was derided by the Ontario party as &quot;irresponsible&quot;. David Lewis of the New Democratic Party accused Social Credit of &quot;harbouring anti-Semites&quot; and stated that &quot;Carmichael is only a symptom. The disease goes much deeper.&quot; Carmichael denied he was anti-Semitic saying &quot;I am not anti-Semitic... I have many Jewish friends... Many of my customers are Jewish.&quot; At a subsequent meeting, he said that his comments were &quot;indiscreet&quot;, that had he known he was going to be quoted he would have &quot;cloaked them in nice phrases&quot;, and accused the Jews of persecuting him for his remarks, blaming a reporter with a Jewish-sounding name for quoting him. In the same meeting Carmichael declared that Adolf Hitler&#x27;s economic system was &quot;a very good and sound system of money&quot; and that the Nazis &quot;had it all figured out so that there was no unemployment.&quot; Carmichael&#x27;s Social Credit membership was not renewed prior to his formation of Social Credit Action.

Social Credit Action supported Réal Caouette when he took his Ralliement des creditistes out of the Social Credit Party of Canada in September 1963, while the official party remained loyal to federal party leader Robert N. Thompson. Audy accused the Ontario Social Credit Association of being dominated by Protestant clergyman who were prejudiced against Caouette because he was a Catholic. Richard Day, a spokesperson for the official Social Credit League of Ontario derided the views of Social Credit Action as being &quot;anti-Semitic, economic trash and hypocritical&quot;.
Social Credit Action nominated six candidates in ridings in Toronto in the 1963 provincial election, while the official party, leaderless since the resignation of Philip Kelly the previous year, nominated only three candidates in rural ridings. The Social Credit Action candidates included Carmichael, Audy, Hartman and fascist John Ross Taylor. However, when it was reported that &quot;the former leader of the Canadian Union of Fascists was running&quot;, the splinter group disassociated itself from Taylor on the eve of the election and he instead ran as a &quot;Natural Order of Social Credit Organization&quot; candidate. Audy was announced by Caouette as his Ontario lieutenant but did not end up running in the 1965 federal election.

Subsequently, Carmichael was accused of allowing the Social Credit Action headquarters to become a meeting place and organizing centre for neo-Nazis disseminating anti-Semitic material, such as David Stanley and John Beattie. Carmichael denied the charge saying &quot;we feel the Jews are trying to stir up hate this way to sell their Israel bonds.&quot; In October, the press reported that anti-Semitic leaflets were being distributed recruiting 14- to 21-year-olds to the right-wing &quot;Canada Youth Corps&quot; where they could be trained in explosives and weapons. The leaflets featured photographs of Carmichael and Stanley and promoted meetings at the Social Credit Action headquarters. Carmichael denied any knowledge of the leaflets or the Canada Youth Corps, and dissociated himself from Stanley. Carmichael and Beattie clashed in the press in April 1965 after Beattie announced the formation of the Canadian Nazi Party announcing that he intended to recruit the &quot;snivelling cowards&quot; in Carmichael&#x27;s Social Credit movement. Carmichael accused Beattie of trying to discredit his party.

By the 1967 provincial election, Social Credit Action had disappeared. The official Social Credit party had elected Wilmer F. Trefold as its new leader in October 1963, the month after the provincial election. In November 1966, Harvey Lainson was elected leader and he led the party in the 1967 election, in which it ran seven candidates.

==Fascist takeover and split==
In the early 1970s, the radical the Edmund Burke Society (EBS) infiltrated the party; Paul Fromm was elected as the party&#x27;s president and other EBSers to the executive. In the 1971 provincial election, three of five Social Credit candidates running in the election were avowed &quot;Burkers&quot;. The party had no identified leader, but Fromm acted as its media spokesman. By 1972, the party had been taken over by the EBS which now called itself the Western Guard. As a result, the party was put under trusteeship at the instigation of the federal party which declared membership in the Western Guard to be &quot;incompatible&quot; with membership in Social Credit. The federal Social Credit Party disavowed the Social Credit Association of Ontario led by John Ross Taylor of the Western Guard and instead recognized the &quot;Ontario Social Credit League&quot;, established in 1973 under the leadership of Bruce Arnold.

In the 1975 Ontario election, the &quot;Ontario Social Credit League&quot;, led by Alcide Hamelin, fielded 12 candidates, mostly in rural areas, but they were not officially recognized as such as the party did not run enough candidates or otherwise qualify for official party status under the newly passed &quot;Election Finances Reform Act, 1975&quot;. while the &quot;Social Credit Association of Ontario&quot; ran three candidates as independents in Metro Toronto who were disavowed by the League as supporters of the Western Guard. In the 1974 federal election, the Ontario Social Credit Association endorsed Martin Weiche as a candidate in Trinity co-endorsed by the Western Guard though because the party was not officially registered with Elections Canada their federal candidates were officially listed as independents.

The Social Credit League ran seven candidates in the 1977 provincial election and several candidates ran as &quot;Independent Social Credit&quot;. Also in 1977, Western Guard leader Don Andrews was convicted of plotting to bomb the Israeli basketball team and was forced to sever his ties with the Western Guard freeing the way for John Ross Taylor to become the group&#x27;s leader. He folded his Social Credit Association and became leader of the renamed Western Guard Party.

==Later years==
Reg Gervais was leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party in 1981 and announced prior to the March 1981 provincial election that he planned to run in Nickel Belt, but did not follow through. John Turmel claimed to be the interim leader of the Ontario Social Credit Party during the campaign running 5 candidates in the Ottawa area.

In October 1981, the Ontario Social Credit Party conducted a leadership convention. The eleven delegates, who represented about 100 party members throughout the province, elected former Toronto mayoral candidate Anne C. McBride as their new leader in a vote of 7 to 1 with 3 spoiled ballots. McBride was a Nova Scotia-born ordained minister in the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal Christian denomination. She vowed to run the party &quot;on Christian principles&quot;. At various times, McBride ran for mayor of Toronto, tried to form her own United Party of Canada in the early 1980s, and sought the leadership of the federal Social Credit Party of Canada at the 1982 Social Credit leadership convention, and was a perennial candidate in federal, provincial, and municipal elections. However, under her leadership, the party failed to run candidates for the Ontario legislature in any subsequent election and eventually became inactive.

By the 1985 provincial election, the party was defunct though Turmel still claimed to be a &quot;Social Credit&quot; candidate in at least one provincial by-election in the late 1980s. Turmel attempted to create a new Social Credit Party of Ontario in the mid-1980s but was unable to meet the criteria in place at that time for the registration of new political parties which included filing a petition signed by 10,000 qualified voters.

<doc id="1205233" wikidata="Q17118850" url="?curid=1205233" title="Otter Pops">
<text>Otter Pops are a brand of freeze pops sold in the United States. The product consists of a clear plastic tube filled with a fruit-flavored liquid and is one of the earliest brands of this dessert.

Some varieties claim to contain 100% fruit juice, mostly apple juice. This variety was clear, as it also removed any artificial colors. Otter Pops are a frozen treat, but stores generally sell them at room temperature for the consumer to later freeze at home.

==Background==
National Pax introduced Otter Pops in 1970, in competition with Jel Sert&#x27;s similar product, &quot;Fla-Vor-Ice&quot;. As of 1990, the product was manufactured by Merrytime Products Inc. of Marshall, Texas.

In 1996, Jel Sert acquired the rights to Otter Pops as well. During the 2000s, Jel Sert modified the Otter Pops recipe to add more fruit juice.
The company&#x27;s manufacturing facilities are in West Chicago, Illinois. Otter Pops come in 1-, 1.5-, 2- and 5.5-ounce serving sizes. They also come in 10 flavors, each named after a different character:

* Blue (blue raspberry): Louie-Bloo Raspberry
* Red (strawberry): Strawberry Short Kook
* Pink (fruit punch): Poncho Punch
* Yellow (lemon): Rip Van Lemon (discontinued in the late 1970s)
* Green (lime): Sir Isaac Lime
* Purple (grape): Alexander the Grape
* Orange ( orange (fruit)): Little Orphan Orange
* Gold (mango): Major Mango
* Yellow (pineapple) DJ Tropicool
* White (coconut) Cosmic Coconut
* Cyan (tropical punch) Anita Fruit Punch
* Red (cherry) Scarlett O&#x27;Cherry (discontinued in the mid 1990s)

==Sir Isaac Lime protest==

In 1995, National Pax had planned to replace the &quot;Sir Isaac Lime&quot; flavor with &quot;Scarlett O&#x27;Cherry&quot;. A fourth-grade student in Costa Mesa, California learned of the change on the company&#x27;s World Wide Web site, and organized a petition and picket with his cousins against it; a Stanford professor wrote in support, calling it &quot;Otter-cide&quot;. Told the change was final, the protest continued as planned, in the rain. The CEO relented, keeping it, despite it being the least popular flavour. The fourth-grader soon appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. An Internet fan site claims that National Pax packaged the cherry mix as strawberry.

==Other uses==
Over the generations, other uses of Otter Pops have been devised and shared in the US. They can be used as a colorful substitute for ice in a punch bowl or to flavor mixed drinks.

<doc id="1205234" wikidata="Q658100" url="?curid=1205234" title="Philip III, Latin Emperor">
<text>Philip III (1329 – 25 November 1373) of the Angevin house, was titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople, as well as Prince of Achaea and Taranto (as Philip II), from 1364 to his death in 1373.

He was the son of Philip, King of Albania and Prince of Taranto, and Catherine II, Latin Empress. Upon the execution of his cousin Charles, Duke of Durazzo, in 1348, he succeeded as King of Albania. Shortly after, his older brother Louis married their first cousin, Joanna I of Naples, and became king. In April 1355, Philip married Joanna&#x27;s younger sister, Maria of Calabria.

In 1364, Philip succeeded as titular Latin Emperor of Constantinople and Prince of Achaea and Taranto on the death of his oldest brother, Robert.

Maria died in 1366. On 20 October 1370, Philip married yet another Angevin, Elizabeth of Slavonia, former heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary. He died on 25 November 1373 in Taranto.

All his children had died young. His heir was his sister&#x27;s son James of Baux.

He had several illegitimate children.

==Family==
By his first wife, Maria of Calabria, Philip had three short-lived sons: Philip (1356), Charles (1358), Philip (1360). They also had two stillborn children, in 1362 and 1366. By his second wife, Elisabeth of Slavonia, Philip had a son named Philip (1371).

<text>Illinois Route 53 (IL 53) is an arterial north–south state highway in northeast Illinois. IL 53 runs from Main Street west of historic U.S. Route 66 (US 66) in Gardner to IL 83 in Long Grove, a distance of . It mainly cuts through the western suburbs of Chicago, passes through Bolingbrook, Romeoville, Crest Hill and Joliet, merging into I-55 at Gardner.

== Route description ==
IL 53 begins at the County Road 29 (CR 29) and I-55 interchange and heads east in Gardner. At the first intersection, the route runs along the path of historic US 66 for about before making a right and leaving former US 66. The route continues east and loops around Gardner before heading northeast, running parallel with I-55. It crosses over the Mazon River before passing through Braceville and Godley. In Braidwood, the highway intersects IL 113 and runs parallel with IL 129. IL 129 moves away from IL 53 before entering the Hitts Siding Prairie Nature Preserve. IL 53 the crosses over the Kankakee River before intersecting the northern terminus of IL 102 in Wilmington. The route then continues north through the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, passing by the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery and the former Joliet Arsenal in Elwood. From Elwood to Joliet, the route follows the old alignment of US 66, becoming concurrent with US 52 for nearly a mile. It also intersects I-80 before separating from US 52 and running concurrently with US 6 entering downtown. At the intersection of US 30, IL 53 separates from US 6 and continues north. It crosses over the Des Plaines River before running concurrently with IL 7 and passing by the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill.
Near Lewis University, IL 7 separates from IL 53. The route passes by Romeoville before interchanging I-55 in Bolingbrook. IL Lisle, the route interchanges US 34 before meeting I-88. It then intersects IL 56 and IL 38 before passing under and running parallel with I-355. West of Addison, it intersects US 20 before passing under I-355 again. Then, it runs parallel with I-290 and intersects IL 19. At Biesterfield Road, the highway then runs concurrently with I-290, intersecting IL 72 and passing over IL 58 before reaching the northern terminus of I-290 at I-90. From there, IL 53 remains as a freeway heading north. It interchanges IL 62, US 14, and US 12 in Palatine. The northeast Palatine stretch that goes through the Rand (US 12) and Dundee (IL 68) interchanges is considered to be one of the country&#x27;s deadliest interchanges in traffic accidents. IL 53 follows Dundee (IL 68) west to Rand (US 12), and then Rand west to North Hicks Road. It then continues north on Hicks until it reaches its northern terminus at IL 83.

== History ==
SBI Route 53 ran from Romeoville to Long Grove on Rohlwing Road and Hicks Road from 1924 to 1963. From 1963 through 1970, it was routed onto a new freeway from Addison to Rolling Meadows and cosigned with I-90 until that was changed to I-290.

In 1967 IL 53 was extended to Gardner, and in 1995 IL 129 was routed onto IL 53 south of Braidwood. This lasted a year until IL 129 was dropped entirely south of Braidwood. Near the northern end, the freeway was extended from Dundee Road to Lake–Cook Road in 1989. In 1990, with the construction of I-355, IL 53 was moved off the I-290/I-355 combination south of Biesterfield Road and back onto its original alignment.

For over 40 years, IL 53 had been at the center of a major dispute regarding a northern extension of its freeway segment into Lake County. The studied corridor ran from the current terminus of the freeway at Lake–Cook Road north to a planned bypass for IL 120 near Grayslake, as part of an earlier plan to build a freeway from Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin. The combined IL 53/IL 120 extension would have formed a large T-shape in the center of Lake County, with the IL 120 bypass carrying through traffic from US 12 to the Tri-State Tollway around Gurnee. The extension was opposed by several organizations, notably the Illinois chapter of the Sierra Club, and many residents of Long Grove, which lies in the path of the highway. The Sierra Club opposed the roadway extension because it would have been routed through wetlands and the group had concerns about suburban sprawl and increased pollution. Due to funding constraints with IDOT, the Illinois General Assembly authorized the Illinois Tollway to plan and construct the IL 53 extension in 1993, and was studied on and off for 25 years. In 2019, the latest study was suspended, effectively cancelling the project.

<doc id="1205242" wikidata="Q4228958" url="?curid=1205242" title="Edward Colston">
<text>Edward Colston (2 November 1636 – 11 October 1721) was an English merchant, slave trader, philanthropist, and Tory Member of Parliament.

Colston followed his father in the family business becoming a sea merchant, initially trading in wine, fruits and textiles, mainly in Spain, Portugal and other European ports. From 1680 to 1692 he was a member of the Royal African Company, which held a monopoly on the English trade along the west coast of Africa, in slaves, gold, silver and ivory. He was deputy governor of the company from 1689 to 1690.

Colston supported and endowed schools and other public institutions in Bristol, London and elsewhere. His name was widely commemorated in Bristol landmarks, and a statue of him was erected in 1895. 

With growing awareness and disapproval in the late 20th century of his involvement in Britain&#x27;s slave trade, there were protests and petitions for landmarks named after him to be renamed, culminating in June 2020, when his statue was toppled and pushed into Bristol Harbour during protests in support of Black Lives Matter. The city&#x27;s concert venue, Colston Hall, was renamed Bristol Beacon along with several other locations that held his name.

==Early life==
Colston was born on 2 November 1636, in Temple Street, Bristol, and baptised in the Temple Church, Bristol. His parents were William Colston (1608–1681), a prosperous Royalist merchant who was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1643, and his wife Sarah Batten (d. 1701), daughter of Edward Batten; he was the eldest of at least 11 and possibly as many as 15 children. The Colston family had lived in the city since the late 13th century. Colston was brought up in Bristol until the time of the English Civil War, when he probably lived for a while on his father&#x27;s estate in Winterbourne, just north of the city. The family then moved to London, and Colston was educated at the Christ&#x27;s Hospital school. The English Civil War shaped Colston&#x27;s lifelong support for order and stability in the form of monarchy and High Anglicanism.

==Career==
In 1654, Colston was apprenticed to the Mercers Company for eight years, and in 1673 he was enrolled into it. By 1672, he had become a merchant in London. Like his father, Colston exported in textiles from London while importing oils, wine and sherry from Spain and Portugal. He also traded silk with Virginia and was a regular trader of Newfoundland cod to Naples. He had built up a successful business trading with Spain, Portugal, Italy and Africa.

In 1680, Colston became a member of the Royal African Company, which had held the monopoly in England on trading along the west coast of Africa in gold, silver, ivory and slaves from 1662. Colston was deputy governor of the company from 1689 to 1690. His association with the company ended in 1692. The company was established by King Charles II, together with his brother the Duke of York (later King James II) as the governor of the company, City of London merchants and other investors.

During Colston&#x27;s involvement with the Royal African Company from 1680 to 1692, it is estimated that the company transported over 84,000 African men, women and children to the Caribbean and the rest of the Americas, of whom as many as 19,000 may have died on the journey. The slaves were sold for labour on tobacco, and (increasingly) sugar plantations.

In 1681 he probably began to take an active interest in the affairs of Bristol, where about this time he embarked in a sugar refinery.
In 1682, he made a loan of £1,800 to the Bristol Corporation and the following year, became a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers. By 1685 he appears as the city&#x27;s creditor for about £2,000.

Although a Tory High Churchman and often in conflict with the Whig corporation of Bristol, Colston transferred a large segment of his original shareholding to William III at the beginning of 1689, securing the new regime&#x27;s favour for the African Company. The value of Colston&#x27;s shares increased and being without heirs he began to donate large sums to charities (see below).

Colston used his money and power to promote order in the form of High Anglicanism in the Church of England and oppose Anglican Latitudinarians, Roman Catholics, and dissenter Protestants. He withdrew from the African Company in 1692, but continued working on his private businesses until he retired in 1708. Colston was then an MP for Bristol from 1710 to 1713.

==Death==

Colston died of old age on 11 October 1721, aged 84, at his home, Cromwell House (demolished 1857), in Mortlake, south west London, where he had lived since about 1689. His will stated that he wished to be buried simply without pomp, but this instruction was ignored. His body was carried to Bristol and was buried at All Saints&#x27; Church. His monument was designed by James Gibbs, with an effigy carved by John Michael Rysbrack.

Colston never married, and settled a &quot;considerable fortune in land&quot; on his nephew Edward Colston (MP for Wells), when Edward married in 1704.
==Philanthropic works==

Colston supported and endowed schools, houses for the poor, almshouses, hospitals and Anglican churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere. His name features widely on Bristol buildings and landmarks.

In 1681, the date of his father&#x27;s death, he appears as a governor of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, to which he afterwards gave frequently. During the remainder of his life he seems to have divided his attention pretty equally between the city of his birth and that of his adoption.

In 1691, on St Michael&#x27;s Hill, Bristol, at a cost of £8,000 (), he founded Colstons Almshouses for the reception of 24 poor men and women, and endowed with accommodation for &quot;Six Saylors&quot;, at a cost of £600, the merchant&#x27;s almshouses in King Street. He also endowed Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital school. In 1696, at a cost of £8,000, he endowed a foundation for clothing and teaching 40 boys (the books employed were to have in them &quot;no tincture of Whiggism&quot;); and six years afterwards he expended a further sum of £1,500 in rebuilding the schoolhouse. In 1708, at a cost of £41,200 (), he built and endowed his great foundation on Saint Augustine’s Back, for the instruction, clothing, maintaining and apprenticing of 100 boys; and in time of scarcity, during this and next year, he transmitted some £20,000 () to the London committee,
to be managed by the Society of Merchant Venturers for its upkeep. He gave money to schools in Temple (one of which went on to become St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School) and other parts of Bristol, and to several churches and the cathedral.

The Colston Society, which had operated for 275 years commemorating Colston, latterly as a charity, decided to disband in 2020.

==Memorials==

Buildings in Bristol formerly named in memory of Colston included the Colston Tower and Colston Hall (now Beacon Tower and Bristol Beacon, respectively). Colston Avenue and Colston Street are named after him, as is a regional bread bun, the Colston bun. A statue of Colston is on the exterior of Bristol Guildhall, built 1843–46. There was an 1870 stained-glass window of the Good Samaritan by Clayton and Bell dedicated to Colston&#x27;s memory in the north transept of St Mary Redcliffe, which was removed in June 2020, following the toppling of his outdoor statue. The largest window in Bristol Cathedral is also dedicated to Colston&#x27;s memory; the Bishop of Bristol announced in June 2020 that the Anglican Diocese of Bristol would remove prominent references to Colston from the window.

===City-centre memorial statue===
In 1895, 174 years after Colston&#x27;s death, a statue designed by John Cassidy was erected in the centre of Bristol, to commemorate Colston&#x27;s philanthropy. Colston&#x27;s slave-trading activities were subsequently uncovered in a biography of his life and work written by H.J. Wilkins in 1920, and from the 1990s onwards, there were growing calls for the statue to be marked with a plaque stating that he was a slave trader, or taken down.

In July 2018, Bristol City Council, which was responsible for the statue, made a planning application to add a second plaque which would &quot;add to the public knowledge about Colston&quot; including his philanthropy and his involvement in slave trading, though the initial wording suggested came in for significant criticism from members of the public and a Bristol Conservative councillor, with the result being that the plaque was reworded. This wording was edited by a former curator at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, creating a third proposal which was backed by other members of the public, though it was criticised by the academic behind the first two versions, who claimed it &quot;sanitised&quot; history, minimising Colston&#x27;s role, omitting the number of child slaves, and focussing on West Africans as the original enslavers. Nevertheless, a wording was subsequently agreed upon and the bronze plaque was cast. After the plaque was physically produced, its installation was vetoed in March 2019 by the Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, who criticised the Society of Merchant Venturers for the rewording. A statement from the mayor&#x27;s office called it &quot;unacceptable&quot;, claimed that Rees had not been consulted, and promised to continue work on a second plaque.

On 7 June 2020, the statue was toppled and pushed into Bristol Harbour by demonstrators during the George Floyd protests; one protester was shown kneeling on the statue&#x27;s neck, referencing the manner in which Floyd died. The statue was retrieved from the harbour four days later by Bristol City Council, and taken to a secure location. After the statue was toppled, the Merchant Venturers said that it had been &quot;inappropriate&quot; for them to have become involved in the rewording of the plaque in 2018, and that the removal of the statue was &quot;right for Bristol&quot;.

From 4 June 2021, the statue was put on display in its damaged condition by Bristol&#x27;s M Shed museum, which stated &quot;this temporary display is the start of a conversation, not a complete exhibition&quot;.

==Modern reappraisal==
In the biography of Colston written by H.J. Wilkins in 1920, the author commented that &quot;we cannot picture him justly except against his historical background&quot;. Colston&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade predated the abolition movement in Britain, and was during the time when &quot;slavery was generally condoned in England—indeed, throughout Europe—by churchmen, intellectuals and the educated classes&quot;.

Since at least the 1990s, with increasing recognition of Colston&#x27;s role in the slave trade, there has been growing criticism of his commemoration. The Dolphin Society, which was formed to continue Colston&#x27;s philanthropy, as of 2015 referred to &quot;the evils of slavery&quot; and recognised that &quot;black citizens in Bristol today can suffer disadvantage in terms of education, employment and housing for reasons that connect back to the days of the trans-Atlantic slave trade&quot;.

The proportion of Colston&#x27;s wealth that came from his involvement in the slave trade and slave-produced sugar is unknown, and can only be the subject of conjecture. He also made money from trading in commodities and interest from money lending.

In April 2017, the charity that runs the venue known at the time as &quot;Colston Hall&quot;, the Bristol Music Trust, announced that it would drop the name of Colston when it reopened after refurbishment in 2020. There had been protests and petitions calling for a name change and some concertgoers and artists had boycotted the venue because of the Colston name. Following the decision, petitions to retain the name of Colston reached almost 10,000 signatures, though the charity confirmed that the name change would go ahead. The hall was renamed as the Bristol Beacon in September 2020, after three years of consultation.

In November 2017, the then Colston&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, funded by the Society of Merchant Venturers, announced that it would not drop the name of Colston, because it was of &quot;no benefit&quot; to the school to do so. Later consultations in 2020 with staff and pupils resulted in the school changing its name to Montpelier High School. 

In summer 2018, Colston Primary School renamed itself Cotham Gardens Primary School after consultation with pupils and parents. 

In February 2019, St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School announced that it would rename its former Colston school house after the American mathematician Katherine Johnson. 

In June 2020, the pub formerly known as the Colston Arms temporarily changed its name to Ye Olde Pubby Mcdrunkface (a reference to the name chosen by the public during a poll to name a new research vessel in 2016), inviting suggestions from the public for a new name. In December 2021, the pub was renamed the Open Arms.

In April 2018, the Lord Mayor of Bristol ordered that a portrait of Colston be removed from her office, saying that she would not &quot;be comfortable sharing it with the portrait&quot;. She said that it is planned that the portrait will be hung in the proposed Museum of Abolition in the city at a future date.

In 2020, at the sight of the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, a member of the organisational team for the event &quot;was adamant that Colston’s charitable deeds in no way made up for the transportation of thousands of Africans into slavery. &#x27;The statue was glorifying the acts of a slave trader. He gave some money to schools and good causes but it was blood money&#x27;, she said&quot;.

<text>The Malaysia national football team () represents Malaysia in international football and is governed by the Football Association of Malaysia. The national team is recognised by FIFA as the successor of the defunct Malaya national football team which was founded for the 1963 Merdeka Tournament one month before the institution of Malaysia. The team is officially nicknamed &quot;Harimau Malaya&quot; in reference to the Malayan Tiger. Former player Mokhtar Dahari is one of the top goal scorers in international history.

Before Malaysia’s formation, the Malaya national football team had already achieved notable success, including a bronze medal at the 1962 Asian Games. Malaysia&#x27;s most significant achievements include qualifying for the 1972 Summer Olympics, winning the AFF Championship in 2010, and earning multiple SEA Games gold medals in 1961, 1977, 1979, and 1989. The team competes in tournaments such as the AFC Asian Cup, AFF Championship, and World Cup qualifiers, with Bukit Jalil National Stadium serving as its home ground. Over the years, Malaysia has developed strong rivalries with teams like Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore, contributing to the rich football culture in the region.

== History ==

=== Early years (1963–1969) ===

Prior to 16 September 1963, North Borneo (now Sabah), Sarawak, Malaya and Singapore were represented by their own national teams, a situation which pre-dated the establishment of Malaysia. Malaya and Singapore often competed in international competitions such as the Merdeka Tournament while North Borneo and Sarawak competed in Borneo Cup. Malaya&#x27;s biggest achievement in football was becoming the bronze medalist of the 1962 Asian Games held in Jakarta, Indonesia after defeating South Vietnam 4–1 led by Abdul Ghani Minhat, who at that time was the first Asian player to reach 50 goals for the men&#x27;s national teams.
The beginning of the Malaysian football team match took place in Merdeka Stadium on 8 August 1963 with the combined strength of Singapore and Malaya (although the federation only existed after 16 September 1963). With the combined forces of Malaya and Singapore, the team began by facing Japan, and lost 3–4. The team continued to use a combination of players from Singapore and Malay Peninsula until the formation of the Malaysia team, wherein the Football Association of Malaya was succeeded by the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM). The combination players with Singapore ended when the latter separated from Malaysia along with the establishment of Football Association of Singapore (FAS) and their subsequent reaffiliation with FIFA in 1965. Since then the squad was only represented by West Malaysian players, mainly due to travel time difficulties to East Malaysia and the players were not well known to the mainstream West Malaysian football. From 1966 to 1970, Chow Chee Keong was voted by Asian Football Confederation as the best Asian&#x27;s goalkeeper for 5 straight years.

=== Olympic Tournament and Asia Competition (1970–1980) ===

In 1971, James Wong of Sabah was the first player from East Malaysia to represent the country. Malaysia qualified for the 1972 Olympics in Munich, beating Japan 3–0, South Korea 1–0, Taiwan 3–0 and the Philippines 5–0 along the way. Although they managed to defeat the United States 3–0, they lost the other two matches with a score of 0–3 to West Germany and 0–6 to Morocco, ranking 10th in the final standings.
Since 1972, Mokhtar Dahari has been considered a legendary football player for the Malaysian team maintaining his place as one of the best players in Asia. He manage to score a total of 125 goals in 167 appearances for Malaysia (including matches played against club sides, national &#x27;B&#x27; teams and selection teams). Against other nations&#x27; national &#x27;A&#x27; teams, he scored 89 goals in 142 appearances. This makes him as one of the world&#x27;s top scorer for men&#x27;s national teams at one time.

Together with the record of Soh Chin Ann. According to both RSSSF and IFFHS, Soh is the player with the most international caps in men&#x27;s football and become the first men&#x27;s footballers to reach 200 or more international caps (219). Two years later, Malaysia won their second bronze medal at the 1974 Asian Games after defeating North Korea 2–1. The team went on to qualify twice in a row for the AFC Asian Cup, in 1976 and 1980. It was only in 1977; when the FAM sent a talent scout to the East. The list continued by the late James Yaakub of Sarawak in 1977. The team also won the Merdeka Tournament four times, became runner-up three times and achieved third place twice during the 1970s. Malaysia qualified again for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, beating Indonesia 6–1, South Korea 3–0, Brunei 3–1, Philippines 8–0 and tied
with Japan 1–1. Thus, the team meet South Korea in the play-off match. Malaysia won the play-off against South Korea with a 2–1 scored in the Merdeka Stadium and qualified but joined the US-led boycott of the games as the Malaysian government made a decision to protest the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan.

==== 1976 AFC Asian Cup Group A ====
Malaysia participated the 1976 AFC Asian Cup for the first time, meeting Kuwait and China in Group A. During the tournament, Malaysia came in third place in the group, losing 0–2 to Kuwait in the opening match and drew 1–1 with China in the second match.

==== 1980 AFC Asian Cup Group B ====
Malaysia made its second Asian Cup appearance in 1980, placed in Group B alongside South Korea, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. They managed to hold South Korea 1–1 in the first match, but would lose 1–3 to Kuwait before regaining a 2–0 victory against the United Arab Emirates. Malaysia would eventually finish 3rd after holding Qatar 1–1 in their last match.

=== Falling performances and drought (1990–2009) ===

In 1994, Malaysian football was embroiled in one of the largest bribery scandals in the country. With the dearth of mainstream interest and lack of funds, Malaysian football has failed to repeat the performances of the 1970s and 1980s to qualify into major tournaments, despite the recruitment of Claude LeRoy. Allan Harris appointed as a new head coach in 2001. Harris came with strong credentials, having assisted Terry Venables at FC Barcelona. In the second half of 2004, FAM appoint Bertalan Bicskei, former Hungarian goalkeeper and national coach, to succeed Allan Harris. Bicskei led the national side to third place at the regional Tiger Cup tournament, but was demoted to youth development duties by FAM for his actions during a friendly against Singapore in Penang on 8 June 2005. Bicskei, disgusted by the standard of officiating, threw a bottle onto the pitch before confronting a Singapore player. In September 2005, his contract was terminated after a mutual agreement.

Norizan Bakar became the next head coach of the Malaysian team. He guided the Malaysian squad to the 2007 AFF Championship semifinals in 2007, where Malaysia lost through penalties to Singapore. Norizan&#x27;s position as the head coach was criticised by the Malaysian football community, fans and officials alike, after the team&#x27;s performances during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup as co-host of the edition, where Malaysia lost to China 1–5, Uzbekistan 0–5 and Iran 0–2. After the removal of Norizan Bakar, B. Sathianathan took over as head coach. Although he guided the squad to win the 2007 Merdeka Tournament, Malaysia once again failed to qualify for the World Cup after losing 1–4 and drawing 0–0 with Bahrain in the qualifying round. In March 2008, Sathianathan once again reached the final of the Merdeka Tournament. However, Malaysia lost on penalties to Vietnam. Sathianathan also led Malaysia to the semi-finals of the 2008 Myanmar Grand Royal Challenge Cup. However, Malaysia then shockingly lost 1–4 to the eventual winners, Myanmar.

During the 2008 AFF Championship, Malaysia started their campaign with a 3–0 win over Laos but were defeated in the second match by Vietnam with a score of 2–3 and were finally eliminated when they lost 0–3 to Thailand in the final match of the group stage. This was the first time that the Malaysian squad had not passed through the group stages in 12 years. There were also reports that match-fixing and bribery that infiltrated Malaysian football in 1994 have returned. In the 2011 Asian Cup qualifiers, the Malaysian team lost 0–5 to the United Arab Emirates. This defeat was the final straw in the eyes of Malaysian supporters, and in February 2009, the contracts of Sathianathan and manager Soh Chin Ann were terminated.

==== FA Premier League Asia Cup (2003) ====
In July 2003, Malaysia qualified for the 2003 FA Premier League Asia Cup as the host nation and as the only national team to ever do so, and on 24 July 2003, they lost 1–4 against Chelsea in the semi-finals in a match where Hairuddin Omar scored Malaysia&#x27;s only goal of the tournament to bring the match to 1–1. In the third-place playoff on 26 July 2003, they lost 0–4 against Birmingham City and placed fourth in the tournament.

=== AFF Championship triumph (2010) ===
In April 2009, K. Rajagopal was named the new coach of Malaysia replacing B. Sathianathan and took over the position in July 2009, of which he also looked after the Malaysia under-23 squad. Rajagopal&#x27;s first match was against Zimbabwe, which Malaysia won 4–0. Rajagopal also coached Malaysia in two games against visiting English champions, Manchester United, losing both matches 2–3 and 0–2. During his time as the coach of the Under-23 team, Rajagopal led Malaysia to their fifth SEA Games gold medal and also led Malaysia to qualify for the second round of the 2010 Asian Games as one of the best four third-placed teams after a lapse of 32 years.

During the 2010 AFF Championship, a total of 14 Malaysia&#x27;s players were under the age of 23. Placed in group A and lost the first match to host Indonesia 1–5, Malaysia bounced back from defeat drawing Thailand and beating Laos 5–1. As runner up of group, Malaysia qualified for the semi-finals to meet Group B winners and defending champions Vietnam. In the first leg of the semifinal, Malaysia won 2–0 on home soil and later drew 0–0 in the second leg, advancing to the final with an aggregate of 2–0. An opportunity of revenge opened up in the finals as Malaysia again met Indonesia, who were unbeaten in all previous matches.

On the first leg of the finals at home, Malaysia won 3–0. Malaysia scored twice through Safee Sali and once through Mohd Ashaari Shamsuddin on a night when Bukit Jalil National Stadium was filled over capacity for the first time since it was built. The match attracted so many people that after tickets were sold out, policemen manning the gates were seen allowing friends and relatives into the stadium, causing people to trespass onto the cable bridge above the electronic display besides standing on the aisles and corridors to view the game. On the second leg of the finals that was held in Jakarta, Malaysia lost 1–2 to Indonesia but the final aggregate was 4–2 to Malaysia, thus Malaysia were awarded the title. It was the first time in history that Malaysia were crowned the champions of AFF Championship and a trophy in the international stage.

=== Stagnation (2011–2022) ===
Since the 2010s, the expectations of improved performances rose, but the team still failed to deliver any new high achievements or set new records. In June 2014, Dollah Salleh replaced Rajagobal as the head coach after his contract has ended. Dollah guided Malaysia to the final of the 2014 AFF Championship but failed to replicate the same form as the previous head coach. In the following international fixtures, the coach has also recorded 0–6 losses to Oman and Palestine as well as 1–1 draw against Timor-Leste. However, the 0–10 defeat to the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia&#x27;s worst ever defeat in history, prompted his resignation as the head coach. The place was taken by interim coach Ong Kim Swee who was later promoted as the head coach until the end of March 2017. The official coaching post then was taken over by Portuguese coach Nelo Vingada in the hopes of raising the Malaysian football performances. On 13 June, Malaysia played their first match in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification against Lebanon. Despite having a 1–0 lead during the first half, they eventually lost the match with a score 1–2. Malaysia&#x27;s poor performance however, continued. Despite being given high hopes and expectations from the match against Hong Kong, Malaysia only managed a 1–1 draw, before losing to the same team 0–2 in Hong Kong. As for the result, frustration happened in the team and Malaysia suffered two consecutive defeats against North Korea, with both matches ending 1–4. Malaysia also lost the second final match against Lebanon in Beirut by 1–2. With only 1 draw and 5 defeats, Malaysia was subsequently eliminated from the qualification. The coaching position was taken over by the team assistant coach Tan Cheng Hoe in late 2017 after Vingada stepped down following a string of poor results.

After failure to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Malaysia proceeded with its journey in the 2018 AFF Championship and was grouped with rival Vietnam together with Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. Malaysia won second place with three wins and only one loss against Vietnam. By qualifying as group runners-up, Malaysia faced Thailand, the fierce rival in their long-time head-to-head records as well as the reigning champions in the tournament, where they were able to overcome the latter by holding them 2–2 in Thailand&#x27;s home stadium of Bangkok, winning the match by away goals rule in one of the tournament&#x27;s greatest shock despite being tied 0–0 earlier at home. In the finals, they met Vietnam again and held the latter 2–2 at home before losing 0–1 in Vietnam&#x27;s home ground of Hanoi, subsequently finishing the tournament with an aggregate of 2–3 as the runners-up for the third time in their AFF Cup history. Despite being unable to achieve the AFF Cup the second time, the enhancing performance of Malaysia was seen with the emergence of new talents coming from its youth football development which brought a hope in future.

Malaysia participated in 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification from the first round due to poor record previously, but facing Timor-Leste, Malaysia easily destroyed the Timorese 12–2 on aggregate. In the second round, they were grouped with three other Southeast Asian rivals; Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, alongside the United Arab Emirates. Malaysia opened their game with a 3–2 comeback victory over rival Indonesia in a match filled with scandal and strong Anti-Malaysian sentiment among Indonesians. It was followed by an unlucky 1–2 home loss to the UAE where the Emiratis bounced back from an early goal. The next encounter was against rival Vietnam in Hanoi, which was the rematch of their 2018 AFF Championship match, ended with another Malaysian defeat as Malaysia fell 0–1. However, Malaysia has not been eliminated as the team can still get an opportunity to qualify further. Then, Malaysia managed one of the most famous victories in their FIFA World Cup campaign, beating neighbour and regional powerhouse Thailand 2–1 at home to keep its dream alive. Malaysia boosted its confidence with its victory over Thailand to overcome a demoralised Indonesia, also at home, 2–0, to occupy second spot behind Vietnam and above Thailand.

However, due to COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Malaysia&#x27;s performance heavily dropped. Prior to the last 3 matches of 2022 FIFA World Cup, many key players were affected, causing Tan Cheng Hoe to call up new players and veteran players. They lost 0–2 against Bahrain and 1–4 against Kuwait in a friendly match, before losing 0–4 to UAE and 1–2 against Vietnam. Although Malaysia managed to win 1–0 against Thailand in the final qualification match, ultimately they failed to advance to the final round. Following Malaysia&#x27;s failure to qualify for the semi-finals of the 2020 AFF Championship in Singapore, Tan Cheng Hoe resigned as the head coach of Football Association of Malaysia.

=== Resurgence of Harimau Malaya (2022–present) ===
After Tan Cheng Hoe&#x27;s resignation, former vice-president of Korea Football Association, Kim Pan-gon was appointed as Malaysia&#x27;s new national team coach on a 2-year contract. His first task was the 2022 FAS Tri-Nations Series held in Singapore in March 2022. At that time, Pan-gon recorded his first success when Malaysia won 2–0 against Philippines but suffered a subsequent 1–2 loss to Singapore in the next match. Pan-gon&#x27;s next challenge came when Malaysia faced Brunei and Hong Kong in a series of friendly matches as part of preparations for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification. Malaysia won 4–0 against Brunei and 2–0 against Hong Kong, raising confidence and support from FAM and Malaysians in the hope of improving Malaysian football&#x27;s fortunes which had declined in the previous years.

In the third round of 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Malaysia faced 3 matches which began with a 3–1 victory against Turkmenistan in the first match, suffering a 1–2 loss to Bahrain, before successfully ending their campaign by defeating Bangladesh with 4–1. Thus, Malaysia finished second in Group E behind Bahrain and automatically qualified for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup on merit after 42 years. Shortly thereafter, Malaysia&#x27;s FIFA ranking rose up to 147th from 154th in March 2022. Later in September 2022, Malaysia entered the 2022 King&#x27;s Cup in Thailand, facing the host and later, Tajikistan in the final. Malaysia won 5–3 on penalties against Thailand after a 1–1 draw but later failed to win the cup after a 0–3 lost in the penalty shootout after being held to a goalless draw.

==== 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification – third round Group E ====
At the end of 2022, before the start of the 2022 AFF Championship campaign, Malaysia held 2 friendly matches against Cambodia and Maldives, winning 4–0 and 3–0 respectively. In the 2022 AFC Championship, Malaysia has won 1–0 against Myanmar with Syihan Hazmi saving a late penalty to secure the win for Malaysia. In the next match, Malaysia went on to thrash Laos 5–0 but lost 0–3 against Vietnam in a controversial match that led to Azam Azmi&#x27;s red card. Yet, Malaysia won 4–1 against causeway rivals, Singapore in the last match being the first time Malaysia had won over Singapore on home soil which also sees Malaysia finishing in second place of Group B, thus seeing them automatically qualified to semi-finals match against Thailand. Malaysia won the first leg of the match with Faisal Halim scoring the only goal in the match but in the second leg, Thailand scored thrice which see Malaysia failing to enter the final after with a 3–1 aggregate defeat to Thailand. Despite this, Malaysia ended 2022 with astonishing results overall which see them rose up to 145th in FIFA ranking.

Later in March 2023, Malaysia won again against Turkmenistan with 1–0 and 2–0 against Hong Kong at the Sultan Ibrahim Stadium in Johor in a series of friendlies. In June 2023, Malaysia won 4–1 against the Solomon Islands and recorded their second biggest victory ever when they won 10–0 against Papua New Guinea at the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium in Terengganu. Shortly after, Malaysia&#x27;s FIFA ranking rose up again to 137th in the world and 4th in ASEAN, behind the Philippines (135th), Thailand (113th) and Vietnam (95th), thus making it the highest ranking attained in 17 years.

In September 2023, Malaysia faced their biggest challenge ever when they met Syria and China in Chengdu, China. Malaysia passed the test after coming back from two goals down to manage a 2–2 draw with Syria and 1–1 with China respectively. In October 2023, the Merdeka Tournament was held after a 10-year absence, with Malaysia meeting India and Tajikistan. In the opening match, Malaysia won 4–2 against India in the semi-final but later lost to Tajikistan again 0–2 in the final.

====2023 AFC Asian Cup====

After 42 years of absence (excluding 2007, when Malaysia was one of the hosts), Malaysia went to the 2023 AFC Asian Cup with high expectations, as they were put in a group with Jordan, Bahrain, and South Korea. As part of the preparation for the tournament, Malaysia had a friendly match with Syria again with the same score as last year, a 2–2 draw. Malaysia opened their tournament with a disastrous start, as they were beaten 0–4 by Jordan. In the second match against Bahrain, whom they met in the qualifiers, the game looked to be ending in a draw, until Ali Madan scored a last-minute goal for Bahrain. Thus, Malaysia failed to advance past the group stages of the AFC Asian Cup again after four appearances, while they were also struggling to find their first Asian Cup win since their last win in 1980.

Malaysia headed into their final group stage fixture against the favourites in the group, South Korea. Within the 21st minute, Malaysia were already 1–0 down through a Jeong Woo-yeong header, heading into the second half of the match on the back foot. However, in the second half, Faisal Halim scored with an audacious chip against South Korean goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo (which was nominated as the goal of the tournament), followed up by a penalty slotted away by Arif Aiman to give Malaysia a surprising 2–1 lead against the Koreans. Eventually, a Lee Kang-in free-kick and a penalty from Son Heung-min put South Korea back in the lead. With the score 3–2 to the Koreans and the match surpassing the 90th-minute mark, it looked to be three losses out of three for Harimau Malaya until the 90+15th minute, when Romel Morales scored an equaliser against all odds. The match ended 3–3, securing a memorable draw, and earning Malaysia&#x27;s first point since 1980.

==== 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification - Second Round ====
Heading into the match against Oman in March, the Malaysian camp remained optimistic about getting positive results. However, Malaysia suffered 2–0 defeats, both away &amp; at home. Malaysia then managed to get 1 point against Kyrgyzstan and 3 points against Chinese Taipei, and eventually finished in third place with 10 points. However, it proved insufficient as Kyrgyzstan finished second with 11 points, thus seeing Malaysia out of contention for the World Cup, and instead compete in the third round of the AFC Asian Cup qualification.

==== Kim Pan-gon&#x27;s resignation and temporary care by Pau Martí ====
Following Malaysia&#x27;s elimination from the World Cup qualification, on 16 July 2024, Pan-gon announced his resignation as Malaysia&#x27;s national team head coach, citing personal commitments. Assistant coach Pau Martí replace Pan-gon as the caretaker coach. While managing the team, Martí helped the team win the 2024 Merdeka Tournament. The 2024 ASEAN Championship is the final caretaker roles of him for the team.

==== Peter Cklamovski appointment and 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification ====
On 16 December 2024, FAM announced the appointment of Peter Cklamovski, who is recently the former manager of FC Tokyo as the new head coach for the Malaysian team. Cklamovski will begin his duties on 5 January 2025, with the task of leading the team to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Subsequently on 11 January 2025, FAM announced a new management line-up for the national team as part of its restructuring process. Rob Friend has been recruited as CEO and Dr. Craig Duncan appointed as head of high performance and sports medicine. Besides, Tim Cahill, a former Australian international footballer, has been elected as a personal advisor on sports and international relations.

All matches are broadcast with both English (Astro only) and Malaysian commentary.

=== Kits ===


Starting from the 1975 Merdeka Tournament until 1977, the Malaysia football team wore the kit from Adidas. In 1978, Malaysia switched to Umbro. From 1979 to 2006, the national team kit was manufactured and sponsored by Adidas. Since 2007, the official Malaysia team kit has been manufactured by Nike. The home kit design of black and yellow stripes is a throwback to the kit used by the Malayan national team in the 1920s. The national team of the 1970s also sported similar stripes, which are supposed to be reminiscent of the stripes of a tiger.

In November 2010, Nike Malaysia created a new football kit specially made for the 2010 AFF Championship. The home kit&#x27;s design of black and yellow stripes is shaped by a black row of lines. The away kit features a plain blue front and red and white at the edge of the sleeves. Nike used the Malaysian flag as their logo instead of the Football Association of Malaysia logo to remember the team&#x27;s success in the 1970s. On the underside of the flag, the quote &quot;Tanah Tumpahnya Darahku&quot; (The land that I spill my blood for) can be found. The quote is part of the Malaysia National Anthem, alluding that they are doing their best for the country.

The practice of using the flag on the kits ended when Malaysia got a new kit in late 2016. They have the FAM logo on the kits.

=== Grounds ===

Home Stadium

Malaysia&#x27;s home stadium is the Bukit Jalil National Stadium. The stadium capacity is 87,411 (seated) which makes it the ninth largest football stadium in the world. Malaysia&#x27;s previous national stadium was the Merdeka Stadium before the Bukit Jalil sports complex was constructed. Since the start of 2017, Malaysia has played its home matches in 5 different stadiums all over Malaysia with Kuala Lumpur Stadium second in line to host an international match.

When there were ongoing renovations at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium, the team played at other stadiums such as Sultan Ibrahim Stadium and Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium. Due to the high population in the Klang Valley, the other stadiums used do not get high support from the fans. The Bukit Jalil Stadium, which is the largest stadium in Malaysia with a capacity of 87,000, is still the home of the Malaya Tigers even though there are several events taking place a few days before the match.

=== Training ground ===
Wisma FAM is the main headquarters for the Football Association of Malaysia which located at Kelana Jaya, Selangor. The training facility for the Malaysia national football team is also located at the Wisma FAM. Other than that, it also serves as a meeting point for the coaches and national players. Also equipped with a room for press statements and small apartment rooms available for the national players during the training camp. Sometimes, ticket matches are also sold on this training facility.

=== Supporters ===
&quot;Ultras Malaya&quot; is the name of the major supporter of the national team in Malaysia. They are known for their high fanaticism and support towards the national team. In every international match the national team plays, they are found in a group standing in the supporters&#x27; area. The main colours for these supporters are usually black with a yellow scarf and banners just like the national team kit colours. These supporters always bring flares, drums and large national flags to the stadiums.

==== Sponsorship ====

<text>The Gay Parade is a 1999 concept album by the band of Montreal and was their third full-length release. Allmusic&#x27;s reviewer Jason Ankeny designated the album &quot;indie pop&#x27;s very own &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot;. Of Montreal&#x27;s drummer and bassist Derek Almstead contemporaneously described it as a collection of character studies, comparable to the Kinks&#x27; 1968 album &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot;.

It has the first album cover designed by lead vocalist Kevin Barnes&#x27; brother David, who has since designed the artwork for nearly every subsequent of Montreal album.

<doc id="1205275" wikidata="Q901854" url="?curid=1205275" title="Fly on the Wall (AC/DC album)">
<text>Fly on the Wall is the tenth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 1 July 1985 by Albert Productions, and Atlantic Records. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series.

==Background and recording==
Although AC/DC&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; was a commercial and critical failure, the band remained one of the biggest hard rock acts in the world. In October 1984, Atlantic Records released to the United States the EP &quot;&#x27;74 Jailbreak&quot;, a collection of studio tracks previously unreleased outside Australia, taken mainly from the band&#x27;s 1975 Australian debut &quot;High Voltage&quot;. In January 1985, the band took three weeks off from recording what would become &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; to headline two nights at the 10-day Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, appearing to over 250,000 people on 19 January with Scorpions, Whitesnake, and Ozzy Osbourne.

The sessions for &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; took place at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland from October 1984 to February 1985. Released on 28 June, it was AC/DC&#x27;s first album since the Australian release of &quot;T.N.T.&quot; not to include drummer Phil Rudd, who was replaced by Simon Wright (although Wright appeared in music videos for &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; tracks), making it the first AC/DC album with all band members born in the UK.

It was the second and last album to be produced by the band members. But in contrast to the preceding &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; – produced by the band as a whole – &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; was produced by guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young, who hoped to capture the rawness and simplicity of their early work in a time when pop-oriented glam metal had become popular. In a 1985 interview with Sky Channel for the Monsters of Rock show, frontman Brian Johnson explained: &quot;In my experience, the lads went in with a producer, but they were still really telling the lad what they wanted, so in a round-about way all it is an extra pair of ears. An expensive extra pair of ears.&quot;

== Video ==
&quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; is a home video by AC/DC, released in the summer of 1985. It consisted of a single music video of five of the songs from the album. The visuals involved AC/DC playing at a bar while various shady characters interacted with an animated fly, much like the one on the cover of the album. It features the band playing (in order) &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Sink the Pink&quot;, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, and &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot;. If nothing else, the video demonstrated the band&#x27;s new commitment to the now powerful MTV by going beyond performance-based videos.

The entire video (minus the credits with the song &quot;Playing With Girls&quot;) can be found on disc two of the band&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Family Jewels&quot; DVD compilation.

==Reception==

The album was not well received by critics and its one million US sales paled beside those of &quot;Back in Black&quot; and &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You&quot;. The singles &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot; and &quot;Sink the Pink&quot; are seen as standouts; both were later included on the band&#x27;s soundtrack album &quot;Who Made Who&quot; for Stephen King&#x27;s film &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;. The song &quot;Danger&quot; fell flat in concert and was banished from the set. Some critics also complained that Johnson&#x27;s vocals were difficult to decipher, and the band would indeed raise them in the remix for &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot; on &quot;Who Made Who&quot;.

In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the album, Tim Holmes wrote, &quot;You&#x27;d never guess how sexist and politically incorrect all this is if you didn&#x27;t read the lyric sheet, because you sure can&#x27;t make out a single word coming out of the dentist&#x27;s-drill glottis of Brian Johnson (except maybe the song titles, which tend to be repeated like mantras). Angus Young is also in great form, playing the dumbest, most irresistibly repetitive chords in the lexicon.&quot; According to Steve Huey of AllMusic, &quot;&quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; continues AC/DC&#x27;s descent into cookie-cutter mediocrity, with the leering humor of past glories seeming forced and uninspired, and the music remaining somewhat underdeveloped and directionless.&quot; In his 1994 Bon Scott biography &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, author Clinton Walker calls the album a &quot;disaster&quot;. Martin Popoff observed how &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; &quot;tries desperately to recapture wasted youth, yet the material for the most part is cookie-cutter AC/DC&quot; and remarked Brian Johnson&#x27;s awkward vocals &quot;mixed quite far back, possibly because he&#x27;s sounding raspier and more incoherent than ever&quot;. US gossip magazine &quot;People&quot; picked the LP as the best album of 1985.

Retrospective reviews are also largely negative. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; explains that Malcolm and Angus Young &quot;made AC/DC sound like a tribute act on a bad night, and as writers all they could muster was one half-decent song, &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot;. All told, the album is a disaster.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; agrees with this sentiment, saying that it was when the band started losing relevancy from the hair metal and thrash metal movements, and while the material does &quot;suggest the band was trying a little too hard to fit in, at least they were trying.&quot;

The album does, however, have at least one &quot;high-profile&quot; fan: singer/songwriter Ryan Adams, who said &quot;I had an epiphany while I was running and some songs from &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; came on. That&#x27;s a record I could always put on my run mix and I don&#x27;t have to leave any songs off.&quot;

== Tour and controversy ==

The Fly on the Wall Tour was marred by bad publicity when serial killer Richard Ramirez was arrested. Ramirez, nicknamed the &quot;Night Stalker&quot; by the press, told police that &quot;Night Prowler&quot; from &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (1979) had driven him to commit murder. Police also claimed that Ramirez was wearing an AC/DC shirt and left an AC/DC hat at one of the crime scenes. As Murray Engelheart observes in his book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;It was just what the band&#x27;s detractors had been waiting for and the media, especially in America, immediately seized on the case. Wild accusations that AC/DC were, in fact, devil worshippers were bandied about... The lyrics of &#x27;Night Prowler&#x27; were carefully analysed and some newspapers attempted to link Ramirez&#x27;s Satanism with AC/DC&#x27;s name, somehow arriving at the conclusion that AC/DC actually stood for Anti-Christ, Devil&#x27;s Child.&quot;

The band maintained that the song had been given a murderous connotation by Ramírez, but is actually about a boy sneaking into his girlfriend&#x27;s bedroom at night while her parents are asleep. In a 2000 interview for the MuchMoreMusic documentary &quot;The Story of AC/DC&quot;, Angus says wryly, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember the last black mass I attended.&quot;

<text>The British Rail [[British Rail unit designations|TC]] (Trailer Control) multiple units were unpowered fixed formations of 3 or 4 carriages with a driving position at each end of the set, converted by BR&#x27;s Holgate Road carriage works from locomotive-hauled Mark 1 carriages in 1966–1967 and 1974. The units built on experience gained from the prototype 6TC unit. In time the 3 car units (3TC, numbered in the series 3xx) were reformed into four car units (4TC numbered in the series 4xx) to match the rest of the fleet and later classified as Class 442. This was later changed to Class 491, under which they spent the majority of their working lives. Shortly before withdrawal they were reclassified Class 438 and the units were renumbered to 8001-8034.

==Operation==
The units were primarily employed on services between London Waterloo and Weymouth. One or two 4TC units would be propelled from London to Bournemouth by a 4REP unit, controlled from the leading cab. At Bournemouth, one or both 4TCs would continue over the then unelectrified line to Weymouth, hauled by a Class 33/1 diesel locomotive, leaving the 4REP at the London end of Bournemouth station. Up trains from Weymouth would follow the same procedure in reverse: the Class 33/1 locomotive would propel its train to Bournemouth (controlled from the 4TC leading cab). There the 4TC/s would couple to the waiting 4REP which would then power the whole formation to London, leaving the Class 33/1 locomotive at Bournemouth to await the next such service. 4TC units were occasionally seen on other duties such as Waterloo to Salisbury, the Clapham Junction to Kensington Olympia shuttle before that line was electrified and surplus units were also used on Sundays to operate Portsmouth Harbour to Reading direct services during the late 1970s &amp; early 1980s. They were pressed into general service as needed, often deputising for electric trains when the power was switched off and occasionally on inter-regional Southern Region services. They ventured further afield on special duties or rail-tours, including Birmingham, Cardiff, Barnstaple/Meeth &amp; Meldon Quarry. Until the closure of the Swanage branch, a small number of through 4TC workings to/from Waterloo were operated, also using class 33/1 locomotives in similar style to the Weymouth trains.

The spare driving trailer second open (DTSO) number 76331 was equipped with an &#x27;updated&#x27; interior - the seats were replaced with &quot;Inter-City&quot; style individual bucket seats (as used in the contemporary Mk2A/B/C carriages) and fluorescent lighting to match. This modified car was then placed into unit 417 from the early 1970s, and the displaced 76302 was kept spare at Bournemouth Traction Maintenance Depot.
No general refurbishment was ever undertaken on the units (see below regarding the work undertaken on 76327) and most of them ran with their original incandescent lighting until withdrawal. A feature of a journey in a 2x4TC/4REP train with the 4REP pushing, was severe jolting at station restarts; this upset many a hot drink over the years. This was particularly prevalent at stations on a descending gradient such as New Milton in the down direction. There would be sometimes several jolts of varying intensity until the couplings were fully compressed.
The Units were fitted with a motor-generator set for lighting supply and a single compressor; these drew power from the REP or loco through the ETH jumpers.

In 1986, two 4TC sets were temporarily converted to 4TCB (Trailer Control Buffet) by removing the TFK coaches and inserting buffet coaches from withdrawn 4REP units. They were designated as the class 492/8 and numbered set 802 and 807. This was in part to compensate for the loss of the Buffet in TC+REP formations as those units were withdrawn over a period of time for scrapping to give up their traction equipment for the new Mk3 based Wessex Electrics.

In December 1987, the two 4TCB sets and four other 4TC sets were converted to 4TCT (Trailer Control Trolley) sets. The buffet coaches in the 4TCB sets and TFK coaches in 4TC sets were replaced with TFK coaches from redundant 4TC sets modified to take catering trolleys. They were designated the class 438/1 and numbered sets 101-106.

Following the withdrawal of the 4REP units, three temporary 5TCB sets were formed in 1988 by inserting REP buffet cars into 4TC sets. They were also designated as the class 492/8 and numbered sets 804, 807 and 809.

On occasion, class 33/0 locomotives were substituted for unavailable 33/1s; in this event the loco had to run-round at Weymouth and the starting bell Loudaphone inter-carriage telephone system could not be used, the guard having to resort to the use of a green flag to start the train at station stops.

At the time that the Clapham Junction - Kensington Olympia service was being run by Network South East with Class 73 traction DTSO number 76327 was part equipped with a modernised interior. The driving end was fitted with 4CEP style windows, ceiling (with fluorescent lights and luggage racks but with 3+2 Class 319 seating.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 25 February 1979, 4TC unit No. 414 formed a passenger train that was hauled by Class 33 locomotive 33 115. The train was in collision with an engineering train near , Hampshire. The crane in the engineering train was foul of the adjacent line, and a side-long collision occurred, severely damaging the locomotive and damaging all four carriages. One person was killed and nine were injured.
*On 12 December 1988, a train comprising 4REP unit 2003 coupled to 4TC units 8015 and 8027 formed the 06:14 - Waterloo service, which ran into the rear of the 07:18 - Waterloo train, formed of 4VEP units 3033, 3119 and 3005 at . The two trains derailed and collided with a third train, formed of 4VEP units 3004 and 3425 running in the opposite direction on an adjacent line. Thirty-five people were killed, 415 were injured.

==Description==
The units were built in two batches. In the first batch, a total of 123 locomotive-hauled Mark 1 carriage were converted comprising 63 TSO to DTSO on Lot 30764, 32 BSK to TBSK on Lot 30765 and 28 FK to TFK on Lot 30766.

In the second batch, 14 locomotive-hauled carriages were rebuilt comprising 2 BSK to TBSK on Lot 30855, 6 FK to TFK on Lot 30856, and 6 TSO to DTSO on Lot 30857. This work included converting the three 3TC units to 4TC. The 1974 build units were fitted with double-glazed windows (except for the sliding toplights) as fitted to contemporary CIG/BIG stock. They also differed from the 1967 units in having the contemporary CIG/BIG style of seating throughout.

Individual vehicle numbering is shown in the table below.

==Further use==
Following withdrawal from passenger service, several vehicles were sold for further use with London Underground. They were used primarily for special excursions trains on the Metropolitan line, hauled by either steam locomotives, or the preserved electric locomotive No. 12 &quot;Sarah Siddons&quot;.

Details of the vehicles sold to London Underground are given below. For further information, see London Underground coaching stock.
Six 4TC vehicles were formed into a test train in 1994 for use by Eurostar to test the third rail pick-ups for use by the Class 373 EMUs. This train consisted of two DTSOs, three TFKs and a TBSK, combined with a Class 73 locomotive and converted Class 33 Driving Van.

Preserved set 417, running with only three coaches, and preserved class 33/1 33103 were hired to Silverlink for a short time in August 1999 for use on the North London Line.

==Preservation==
Two complete units and several other vehicles have been preserved. Unit no. 417 was one of the final two units in service with British Rail. The unit (highlighted pink) was one of two used by London Underground, and will ultimately be based on the Swanage Railway, And the unit 428 (highlighted blue) is used by London Underground on special charters.

DTSO 76275 was originally going to be used with Hastings Diesel Limited Class 201 but now belongs to the Swanage Railway Trust, and will now replace a DTSO currently in their set.

Details are given below.

==Model==
In June 2016 it was announced a OO gauge model produced by Bachmann would be produced in collaboration with Kernow Model Rail, the models are available in a choice of six different livery variations.

<text>John Paizs (born 1957 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian film director, writer and actor. He is most noted for his debut feature film, &quot;Crime Wave&quot;, which was presented at the 1985 Toronto International Film Festival. He was the male lead and also wrote and directed the film.

A key figure in the Winnipeg Film Group, he directed a number of short films prior to &quot;Crime Wave&quot;. He first became known for &quot;The Obsession of Billy Botski&quot;, a short film about a man obsessed with Connie Francis; while the &quot;Three Worlds of Nick&quot; trilogy (&quot;Springtime in Greenland&quot;, &quot;Oak, Ivy, and Other Dead Elms&quot; and &quot;The International Style&quot;) was originally intended as a single film but produced and released as three short films due to Paizs&#x27;s limited budget. 

The Nick trilogy starred Paizs himself as the titular character, a &quot;quiet man&quot; who never speaks a word in any of the three films. The &quot;quiet man&quot; character was also seen in &quot;The Obsession of Billy Botski&quot; and &quot;Crime Wave&quot;, although he had a different name in those films. Paizs first developed the &quot;quiet man&quot; character concept because budgetary limitations largely forced him to appear in his own films instead of hiring a lead actor, but he disliked the sound of his own voice and did not feel that he had any acting talent.

Following &quot;Crime Wave&quot;, Paizs worked primarily as a television director on various series until returning to film in 1999 with &quot;Top of the Food Chain&quot;, a sendup of science fiction B-movies in which an incompetent scientist tries to thwart an alien invasion.

In recent years he has been an instructor and mentor at the Canadian Film Centre.

==Legacy==
Paizs was a key influence on Guy Maddin, who cited &quot;The Obsession of Billy Botski&quot; as inspiring him to make his own short film debut with &quot;The Dead Father&quot; in 1985.

In 2008, Toronto&#x27;s Royal Cinema mounted a retrospective of Paizs&#x27; films, including &quot;Springtime in Greenland&quot;, &quot;Crime Wave&quot; and &quot;Top of the Food Chain&quot;. Norman Wilner of &quot;Now&quot; wrote that &quot;Imagine the playful whimsy of Guy Maddin without the fetish for old silent films and you&#x27;re on your way to understanding Paizs&#x27;s sensibility. His features offer straight-faced deconstructions of film noir and 1950s sci-fi tropes, with characters operating on just the wrong side of self-awareness as they navigate increasingly bizarre situations. Oh, and they&#x27;re funny.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Springtime in Greenland&quot; was selected for inclusion in Canada On Screen, the Toronto International Film Festival&#x27;s retrospective of Canadian cinema which was staged as part of Canada 150.

<doc id="1205290" wikidata="Q1754349" url="?curid=1205290" title="Blue Moves">
<text>Blue Moves is the eleventh studio album by English musician Elton John. It was released on 22 October 1976 through John&#x27;s own Rocket Record Company (his first for the label), alongside MCA Records in certain countries. John&#x27;s second double album, it was recorded at EMI Studios, Brother Studios, Eastern Sound and Sunset Sound Recorders, and was his last to be produced by longtime collaborator Gus Dudgeon until &quot;Ice on Fire&quot; (1985). Additionally, the album would be the last collaboration between John and lyricist Bernie Taupin for the next few years until a partial resumption of their working partnership with &quot;21 at 33&quot; (1980).

The music on &quot;Blue Moves&quot; is considered some of John&#x27;s most experimental, fusing genres such as pop, gospel, disco and jazz while also including orchestral elements and extended song lengths. Guests on the album include David Crosby, Graham Nash, Bruce Johnston and Toni Tennille contributing backing vocals, alongside performances by both the Martyn Ford Orchestra and London Symphony Orchestra, the former of which performing string arrangements by Paul Buckmaster.

Upon its release, &quot;Blue Moves&quot; received mixed reviews. Some critics found the album to be excessive, while others felt it did not include enough strong material to warrant its length. However, some retrospective reviews have been more positive, highlighting it as one of John&#x27;s most underrated releases and praising its experimental nature, and John himself has declared it one of his favorites. &quot;Blue Moves&quot; reached number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, breaking his streak of number one albums there, while it matched that position on the UK Albums Chart. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, reached the top 10 in the US and the top 20 in the UK, while further singles &quot;Bite Your Lip (Get Up and Dance!)&quot; and &quot;Crazy Water&quot; (only released in the UK) both reached the top 30. The album would go on to be certified both Platinum by the RIAA and Gold by the BPI.

==Background==
John&#x27;s previous album &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; (1975) was his first since 1970&#x27;s &quot;Elton John&quot; to not include any contributions from longtime Elton John Band members Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson on bass and drums respectively, as they had been fired after the recording of &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; (1975). Both of these albums debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the first two albums in history to do so, with the latter containing the US number four hit &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; and the former spawning the number one single &quot;Island Girl&quot;. In June 1976, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, a duet with Kiki Dee, was released as a standalone single and also topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

After embarking on the Rock of the Westies Tour and Louder Than Concorde Tour in 1975 and 1976, respectively, John decided to take an indefinite break from touring. In an October 1976 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, John expressed his desire to focus on other projects for the time being, saying he felt it would be &quot;silly&quot; to keep his band members under a contract for an additional year while not being sure what his plans for future performing would be. While Davey Johnstone, Ray Cooper, and James Newton Howard continued to collaborate with John following the release of &quot;Blue Moves&quot;, the album marked the last time John worked with Caleb Quaye and drummer Roger Pope. In the same interview John came out publicly as bisexual, stating &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with going to bed with somebody of your own sex. I think everybody&#x27;s bisexual to a certain degree&quot;; he would later come out as gay in 1992.

==Overview==
&quot;Cage the Songbird&quot; was a tribute to legendary French singer Edith Piaf, and a year or so later was covered by Kiki Dee on an unreleased Rocket album &quot;Cage the Songbird&quot;, which finally was issued in 2008. (&quot;Songbird&quot; originated as part of the &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; sessions, but was not completed during them, probably because the song&#x27;s acoustic, delicate sound did not fit with the more rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll approach of the rest of the songs that made the &quot;Westies&quot; final track list.) The Beach Boys turned down &quot;Chameleon&quot; (which was written two years prior to the album&#x27;s release), but Bruce Johnston, a former Beach Boy, performed backing vocals on John&#x27;s version, along with former Beach Boys touring member Toni Tennille. John also performed the song at Wembley Stadium in 1975, where he also performed the &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; album in its entirety. An excerpt from &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was used for the closing titles on &quot;Top Gear&quot; until the end of that &quot;Top Gear&quot; format (in 2001). This is one of two John albums on which Davey Johnstone does not provide backing vocals; 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Big Picture&quot; is the other.

The basic tracks for &quot;Blue Moves&quot; were recorded at Eastern Sound in Toronto, Ontario. Additional overdubs were done at EMI Studios in Abbey Road, London; Brother Studios in Santa Monica, California; and Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, California. The album was mixed at Marquee Studios in London.

John has played several songs from &quot;Blue Moves&quot; live: &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot;, &quot;Bite Your Lip (Get Up and Dance!)&quot;, &quot;One Horse Town&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Idol&quot; and &quot;Crazy Water&quot; have been played during various concert appearances through the years.

In the summer of 2011, George Michael embarked on what would be his final tour, the orchestral Symphonica Tour of Europe, the UK, and Australia. From the 19 September concert at Budapest Sports Arena, Michael performed &quot;Idol&quot; in place of &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Really Matter&quot; on the setlist. At a special gig in the Royal Albert Hall raising money for the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Michael introduced the song, saying: &quot;This next song was written by someone I hope has made it in here already – Elton. It&#x27;s a song he wrote in the late 70s and it&#x27;s about an ageing pop star. Funny that.&quot; As Michael cast his gaze around the audience, John waved from the stalls, where he sat beside his civil partner David Furnish and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter. Having already recorded his own version of &quot;Tonight&quot; for the &quot;Two Rooms&quot; album in 1991, Michael&#x27;s vocals at that concert ended up on 2014&#x27;s &quot;Symphonica&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Blue Moves&quot; has received mixed reviews since its release. A contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the album &quot;contains nowhere near enough good songs to justify the extended length&quot; and that the interludes and instrumentals were done &quot;to the exclusion of sense&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau described it as &quot;impossibly weepy&quot; and &quot;excessive&quot;. Lindsay Planer of Allmusic later said the album showed the &quot;inevitable fatigue&quot; of John&#x27;s &quot;immense creativity&quot; that had helped create the previous albums of his career.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, except where noted. 


Note: Initial CD versions of the album maintain the same running order, but omit various combinations of the following tracks: &quot;Cage the Songbird&quot;, &quot;Shoulder Holster&quot;, &quot;The Wide-Eyed and Laughing&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s the Shoorah?&quot;. It has since been remastered and re-released as a 2-CD set retaining the original LP track listing.

<doc id="1205291" wikidata="Q699439" url="?curid=1205291" title="Rollei">
<text>Rollei () was a German manufacturer of optical instruments founded in 1920 by and in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, and maker of the Rolleiflex and Rolleicord series of cameras. Later products included specialty and nostalgic type films for the photo hobbyist market.

Originally named &quot;Werkstatt für Feinmechanik und Optik, Franke &amp; Heidecke&quot;, the company renamed into &quot;Rollei-Werke Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH&quot; in 1972, &quot;Rollei-Werke Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;, in 1979, and &quot;Rollei Fototechnic GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; in 1981.

After being purchased in 1995 by Samsung Techwin, part of the South Korean Samsung Group, it was sold back to its internal management in 1999. In 2002, it was bought by a Danish investment group, and renamed &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; in 2004.

In 2005/2006, the company headquarters moved to Berlin and the company was split into two different companies: &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; in Berlin, owner of the Rollei brand and selling various OEM equipment, and &quot;Rollei Produktion GmbH&quot; in Braunschweig, an equipment factory which became &quot;Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH, Feinmechanik und Optik&quot;.

Following another restructuring in 2007, Rollei was split into three companies. &quot;Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH, Feinmechanik und Optik&quot; focused on the production of professional medium format cameras and slide projectors, while &quot;RCP-Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; in Hamburg was responsible for Rollei consumer products like re-branded compact digital cameras in the European market, and with the &quot;RCP Technik Verwaltungs GmbH&quot; owning the rights to the &quot;Rollei&quot; and &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; brands. Finally, &quot;Rollei Metric GmbH&quot; took over the photogrammetry business.

In early 2009, &quot;Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH, Feinmechanik und Optik&quot; declared itself insolvent. Since 2009 Rolleiflex medium format cameras, Rollei 35 and Rolleivision slide projectors were being produced by the &quot;DHW Fototechnik GmbH&quot;—a company founded by Rolf Daus, Hans Hartje and Frank Will, former Franke &amp; Heidecke employees. DHW Fototechnik presented two new Rolleiflex cameras and a new electronic shutter at photokina 2012. DHW itself filed for insolvency on 15 August 2014 and was dissolved in April 2015, thereby temporarily ending any further production of cameras, lenses and accessories. A new, smaller company called DW Photo was formed with reduced staffing, and more or less the same people leading the business; the manufacturing and sale of projectors and twin-lens reflex cameras, as well as that of the series 6000, was stopped, to concentrate on the Hy6 and accessories. A new battery and charger for owners of the 6000 series were however released to the market in 2019, as the original NiCd batteries could age prematurely.

As of 2015 the brands &quot;Rollei&quot; and &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; continue to be owned by the &quot;RCP Technik Verwaltungs GmbH&quot;. On 1 January 2015, the &quot;RCP-Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; refirmed as &quot;Rollei GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; to market digital consumer cameras and accessories under the &quot;Rollei&quot; label in Europe.

== Overview ==
Rollei was a German company that established a worldwide reputation with the Rolleiflex, a twin-lens reflex camera.

Rollei was founded in 1920 as the &quot;Werkstatt für Feinmechanik und Optik, Franke &amp; Heidecke&quot; in order to make a twin-lens reflex camera. The company changed its name and legal form many times: to &quot;Rollei-Werke Franke &amp; Heidecke&quot; in 1962, to &quot;Rollei-Werke Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; in 1979, to &quot;Rollei Fototechnic GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; in 1981, and finally to &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; in 2004. In 2006, the headquarters of &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; were moved to Berlin while production was transferred to &quot;Rollei Produktion GmbH&quot;, currently &quot;Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH&quot;, in Braunschweig. The company underwent more radical restructuring in 2007/2008.

The frequent name-changes are an indication of a turbulent history: After the popularity of the twin lens reflex cameras declined, the &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; was supplemented with a variety of models. The company expanded its production facilities and product range at the end of the 1960s beyond what a small company like Rollei could manage. Rollei&#x27;s decision to start manufacturing in Singapore in 1970 was regarded as a pioneering achievement by the photographic industry. Unfortunately, it also damaged the companies reputation as a German precision manufacturer. In 1982, after many failed attempts at restructuring, the company finally achieved success by focusing on medium format cameras along with a few other products. Surveying systems were added to the product range in 1986, and modern digital and compact cameras were included from 1991.

Over the years, many great photographers have used Rollei cameras: David Bailey and Diane Arbus (Rolleiflex 3.5F TLR with 75 mm f/3.5 Planar), Brett Weston (Rolleiflex SL66 and SL66E SLR), and Helmut Newton (Rolleiflex 2.8GX), amongst others.

Rollei cameras typically used Carl Zeiss or Schneider Kreuznach lenses, as well as lenses manufactured by Rollei based on designs by Zeiss, and occasionally lenses made by Japanese manufacturers.

== Historical development ==

=== 1920 to 1928 ===

==== Company foundation ====

While Reinhold Heidecke was working as a production manager at Voigtländer in Braunschweig around 1916, he got the idea to manufacture a new type of roll-film camera. However, the company rejected his proposal because they thought there would be problems keeping the film perfectly flat. Besides, their current camera range, which used conventional photographic plates, was selling well. Heidecke tried unsuccessfully to secure financing to start his own company, so, at the insistence of his wife, he presented his concept to , a salesman and former colleague at Voigtländer. Franke was so enthusiastic he put up 75,000 M of his own money and went looking for more capital. After he secured additional funding of 200,000 M, they resolved to go into business together. In November 1919, they filed an application to register the company &quot;Franke &amp; Heidecke&quot;, which was entered into the German Trade Register on 1 February 1920.

In need of factory space, they rented several rooms in a house at Viewegstraße 32, which became the companies first headquarters. The house survived World War II intact and stands to this day. Other rooms in the house were used by a dancing school, who had to abandon their dancing lessons because of noise from the factory. Within a year, Franke and Heidecke had taken over the entire building. By 1922, business was so good that they were able to take out a loan to purchase the property outright.

==== Stereo Heidoscop ====
To get the company going, Franke and Heidecke decided to manufacture a stereo camera in the short term. Cameras of this type were popular, and Reinhold Heidecke was very familiar with them. As they were also in Voigtländer&#x27;s product range, however, Franke and Heidecke did not want to look as if they were simply copying theirs. They purchased several Voigtländer units, and from what they learned by dismantling these, constructed the &quot;Stereo Heidoscop&quot;. It included two Carl Zeiss &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses (f/4.5, 55 mm) and, mounted between them, a Carl Zeiss &quot;Super Triplet&quot; (f/3.2) viewfinder. At that time, &quot;Tessar&quot; lenses were widely regarded as the best available; they were often used in the United States, even though locally produced alternatives were available. Zeiss had an excellent reputation world-wide, which Franke &amp; Heidecke leveraged for their own products. More importantly, they differentiated themselves from cheaper alternatives. The camera projected an image onto glass plates of dimensions 45 mm × 107 mm. The name &quot;Heidoscop&quot; was chosen in part to remind the management at Voigtländer that they had restricted Heidecke in his work there.

The Heidoscop was a great success, exceeding all expectations. In 1923, the company introduced a &quot;Heidoscop&quot; for 117 format (B1) roll-film. It was from this product, the &quot;&#x27;Roll-film Heidoscop&quot;&#x27;, that the name &quot;Rollei&quot; was derived, which later became the name of company.

==== Hyperinflation in Germany ====

Between 1914 and 1923, the period of hyperinflation in Germany, Paul Franke lived up to his reputation as a savvy financier: he invested the income from exports (in foreign currency) so astutely that the company came through this difficult period unscathed – a rather unlikely outcome if Heidecke, alone, had made these decisions.

During this period the company acquired new premises. The City Council in Braunschweig did not really want a noisy factory operating within a residential area and pressured the company to move its factory elsewhere. Accordingly, on 10 January 1923 the company purchased a plot of land on Salzdahlumer Straße, which at that time lay just beyond the city limits. Hyperinflation had devalued the currency so much that the land purchase cost practically nothing. Once the new factory had been built, much was expected of the new camera. However, Paul Franke proposed a temporary suspension of further development work because of the catastrophic economic situation. Heidecke concurred, believing that better times lay ahead.

==== Rolleiflex ====

The first prototype of the new camera, named the &quot;Rolleiflex&quot;, was finally completed in 1927; it was built for absolute reliability and featured a rigid, injection-moulded housing made of aluminium. Heidecke wanted to avoid conventional leather bellows for focusing the lens because of an earlier, bad experience: around 1916, he conducted an experiment with a Kodak camera; he left it in a cellar, and when he later retrieved it, he found that rats had eaten the bellows. This convinced him that a camera designed for photojournalism and operation in the tropics had to work perfectly, which excluded components that might rot. He ruled out a cloth shutter curtain for the same reason, choosing instead a Compur mechanical shutter.

Focusing in the &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; was achieved by moving the carriage that held both the viewfinder and the imaging lens, i.e. the camera had so-called &quot;metallic bellows&quot;; that is, the plate enclosed the sides of the case. It was crucial that the plate remained parallel as it moved during focusing; to achieve this, Heidecke developed an ingenious design which proved to be highly successful. Behind the imaging lens and surrounding the opening for the optical path was a large cogwheel which drove four smaller cogs located top left and right, and bottom left and right. Each of the four small cogs drove rack and pinions (toothed rails) attached to the lens assembly. This system functioned perfectly, and, thanks to high-quality components, also for many years of service. Only the viewfinder and back of the camera, both made of aluminium, had to be handled with care, which remained the case until the camera went into production.

One more prototype was produced in 1928, and then the big moment finally arrived: on 10 August, the first camera went into series production. Altogether, 14 units were made that year. Then, at 11am on Monday, 11 December, selected journalists were invited to a press conference in the festively decorated production area. Paul Franke put together press packs for the occasion, which led one magazine to publish a test report without ever actually handling the camera. Although Franke had forgotten to prepare sample photographs to distribute to the press, he neatly avoided this oversight by distributing empty, labelled cartons around the building, just for show.

=== 1929 to 1950 ===

==== New premises ====
Demand for the new camera exceeded production capacity by a wide margin. Even though it was quite an expensive product, orders for 800 cameras were received in the first month alone. A &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; fitted with a f/4.5 lens cost , with a f/3.8 lens it cost . This success made it possible to obtain credit to buy a new factory and thrive in the midst of the Great Depression. In the old factory, a further 23,720 cameras were produced up until 1932. In 1930, the company moved into the new factory on Salzdahlumer Straße. It comprised two floors with a total area of , sufficient space to manufacture 20,000 cameras annually. Although the site was well served by public transport, it lay some distance from the city centre, so the company built a canteen and shop for its workforce, which now numbered 309 employees.

==== Babyflex ====
Wilhelmine Heidecke, Reinhold Heidecke&#x27;s wife, suggested building a &quot;ladies camera&quot; – a &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; that used 35 mm film. This was the first &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; to come on the market that used a crank handle to advance the film, a popular feature that emerged on the 6×6 model shortly thereafter. The &quot;Rolleiflex 4×4&quot; – known as the &quot;Babyflex&quot; outside of Germany – used 127 format film and came in two versions with either a f/3.5 and a f/2.8 Tessar lens with a focal length of 60 mm. Unfortunately, sales were disappointing, so production never resumed after the war. The company management believed that many Rollei photographers only made contact prints from their negatives because they had no access to enlargers. However, this was not practical in the case of the &quot;Babyflex&quot; as the negatives were simply too small. As a result, it was not until 1957 that a new version came onto the market priced at DM355, firstly in grey, and later (from 1963) in black. By the time production ceased in 1968, over 67,000 units had been made. By this time few amateur photographers made contact prints any more, preferring instead to take 35 mm transparencies (slides), which could be viewed on a slide projector.

==== Studio camera ====
In 1932, Salomon Kahn, the owner of the renowned &quot;Fotostudios Kardas&quot; in Berlin, approached Rollei, asking if they could build him a large &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; for the 9 cm × 9 cm film format. Kahn explained as a pretext, that his customers liked to keep the negatives because they had doubts about the durability of prints. Moreover, roll film was much easier to archive than glass plates.

In fact, Kahn had concealed the real rationale behind his request because Franke &amp; Heidecke supported the Nazi Party in order to get the workers they needed. Fearing the consequences of leasing to a Jew, the owner of his studio had already shut off his water supply. This meant that Kahn had to develop his negatives at home, whereby roll film was easier to transport than plates. A roll film camera would also facilitate house calls.

Having built a small &quot;Rolleiflex&quot;, the obvious next step was to make a larger version. Indeed, the slogan &quot;you see what you get&quot; had already been envisaged for it. Such a camera would make studio work more straightforward; at that time, the photographer had to stoop under a black cloth to adjust the camera, and then address the subject from this awkward position. Nevertheless, after the failure of the &quot;Babyflex&quot;, the company proceeded with caution by initially building some prototypes. One was delivered to Kahn, and the others were shipped abroad in pairs – one to be retained by the importer as a demonstration unit, the other to be delivered to a reputable studio. The project was eventually abandoned after Salomon Kahn was arrested and nobody else showed any interest in the studio camera. Of the 14 prototypes that were built, one still exists: it currently belongs to the Municipal Museum of Braunschweig.

==== Rolleicord ====

In 1933, the &quot;Rolleicord&quot;, a cheaper version of the &quot;Rolleiflex&quot;, came onto the market. It had simpler Zeiss Triotar Lens, a steel back-plate, and a knob instead of a handle for winding on the film. The &quot;Rolleicord 1&quot; cost ; altogether 2,699,505 &quot;Rolleicords&quot; were manufactured until production ceased in 1976. The later models (III - VB) uses &quot;Schneider&quot; Xenar lenses that have better optics.

==== Rolleiflex Automat ====
The release of the &quot;Rolleiflex Automat&quot; in the middle of June 1937 marked another significant milestone for Franke &amp; Heidecke. Prior to this, after taking a picture, two separate steps were required to advance the film and cock the shutter. The &quot;Rolleiflex Automat&quot; combined the two, whereby advancing the film automatically cocked the shutter. Not only did this innovation speed up the whole process, it also eliminated accidental double exposures resulting from inadvertently forgetting to wind on the film. It also had a film-feeler mechanism that automatically started the counter, so no red window was needed.

The &quot;Rolleiflex Automat&quot; won the Grand Prix award at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair in 1937, which generated a lot of interest. The company founders we so taken with their new creation that they immediately commissioned the construction of a second factory. The new factory, comprising three floors with a combined production area of , provided sufficient space to house a further 700 workers. It was completed in 1938, and by the end of that year the 300,000th camera had come off the production line. In retrospect, Reinhold Heidecke regarded the &quot;Rolleiflex Automat&quot; as his favourite camera.

==== World War II ====
During World War II, the company was required by the Nazis to support the war economy. As a result, Rollei was unable to develop any new models from 1940, and production of its stereo camera finally came to an end. Rollei also suffered massive losses resulting from its inability to collect monies owed by debtors from &quot;enemy states&quot;. Furthermore, bureaucratic formalities and controls hindered exports to neutral countries. This situation, combined with the collapse in overseas trade, forced Paul Franke to reduce the workforce to 600 people.

===== Armaments production =====
Alongside its renowned cameras, Rollei – like its neighbour Voigtländer – was now engaged in the manufacture of equipment deemed important to the German war effort: precision optics for binoculars, periscopes, telescopic sights (for sniper rifles, for example), and theodolites for directing artillery. Although these products consumed the bulk of the companies resources, some regular product development was still possible, and work on tempered glass lenses as well as flash synchronization continued, albeit on a small scale. The cameras were used inter alia in military reconnaissance.

As Braunschweig was one of the centres of the German armaments industry, it was subjected to frequent, sometimes heavy aerial bombardment, which seriously damaged the city. On 1 and 15 January 1944, and again on 13 August, Rollei too suffered air raid damage to its factories. By the time the war ended on 12 April 1945, almost 65% of its plant and machinery had been destroyed.

==== The post-war period ====
After the war, Braunschweig ended up in the British occupation zone. The allied occupying forces wanted Rollei to survive as a company, even helping it procure lenses from Zeiss, which had ended up in the Soviet occupation zone. Franke &amp; Heidecke started over with 72 workers, and by Christmas 1945 the workforce had grown to 172 employees. Everything the company made in 1945 was delivered to the British Ministry of Defence. The difficult supply situation forced Rollei into using lenses from the West German manufacturer Schneider as well. However, this was not a problem as Schneider&#x27;s quality control was equal to that of Zeiss.

Paul Franke&#x27;s untimely death in the spring of 1950 had serious consequences for the company though. Not only did his passing mark the end of an era for Rollei, the loss of his business acumen also led the company to the edge of ruin on more than one occasion.

=== 1950 to 1963 – Horst Franke era ===

==== The golden era ====
After Paul Franke&#x27;s death, his son Horst Franke succeeded him. Overall, he proved to be less effective as a manager than his father. In particular, he lacked the flexibility required to adapt to changing circumstances; for example, he failed to reduce the workforce in difficult times, whereas Paul Franke had done so immediately at the onset of the war.

To begin with, Rollei had no real competition, which yielded ever increasing sales of its cameras. In the 1950s, almost every press photographer owned a &quot;Rolleiflex&quot;, and quite a few amateurs did as well. The camera was so popular that it bred over 500 imitations, more than half of them from Japan. The factory grew rapidly; by 1956 – the year the millionth camera was sold – the workforce numbered 1600, and by 1957 the workforce had grown to 2000 employees.

==== Development of the Rolleiflex ====
Hans Hass, the underwater diving pioneer, approached Franke &amp; Heidecke to see if they could make him a special housing suitable for underwater photography. As a result, Rollei developed the &quot;Rolleimarin&quot;, an ingenious underwater camera housing rated for depths up to 100 m. It was made from two cast metal parts. The top part contained a glass prism that was attached to the camera&#x27;s focusing screen. There were also knobs on top of the housing for adjusting the exposure and aperture settings. On the bottom, left-hand side of the housing was the focusing knob, and on the right-hand side, the winding handle and a frame counter. There was also a filter turret. A special flash bulb could be attached for flash photography, in which case a battery pack had to be installed inside the housing. Of course, a viewfinder frame could also be screwed onto the housing.

Although there were many imitators, none could match the quality of the original &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; – that is, until the &quot;Mamiya C-Series&quot; from Japan appeared in 1956. Mamiya initially offered three sets of interchangeable double lenses for it: normal, telephoto and wide-angle. Later on, additional double lenses with focal lengths of 55 mm and 250 mm were introduced; one even had a dimmable viewfinder lens, which enabled depth of field adjustment through the viewfinder. By comparison, the &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; only had a single, fixed normal lens, although the Rollei &quot;Magnar&quot; tele-converter lens with 4x magnification was available as an accessory. This could be attached to the front of the primary lens while a mask (which did not magnify the image) was placed over the focusing screen. In addition, Zeiss offered two double lens converters which attached to the viewfinder filter bayonet and the primary lens bayonet. The 5-element &quot;Mutar&quot; tele-converter magnified 1.5×, weighed 327 g and could render an image accurately in the viewfinder up to a distance of 4m from the object. The 4-element &quot;Mutar&quot; wide-angle converter magnified 0.7×, weighed 437 g and could render an object accurately from a distance of 1 meter. In all cases, for the best image quality, closing down the aperture two stops was recommended. This explains why conversion lenses of this type were only regarded as a makeshift solution in comparison to fully interchangeable lenses.

In response to the challenge from Mamiya, Rollei created a camera comparable to the &quot;C Series&quot; and gave it to photojournalists to test. Although they were enthusiastic, Rollei did not believe – much to the astonishment of industry experts – that it could manufacture removable lenses with the required precision. Instead, as a compromise, the company introduced in 1959 the &quot;Tele-Rolleiflex&quot; with a Zeiss &quot;Sonnar&quot; f/4, 135 mm lens. This camera was particularly well-suited to portrait photography. Meanwhile, plans for another model with a 150 mm lens were abandoned. The &quot;Wide Angle Rolleiflex&quot; (also known as the &quot;Rolleiwide&quot;) with an f/4, 55 mm lens followed in 1961. It only remained in production until 1967, which today makes it one of the rarest &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; cameras – excluding special editions. Its main advantage lay in its ability to photograph large crowds at heavily attended events.

Reinhold Heidecke kept on making new cameras right up until his death in 1960, although no one bothered to admonish him over the development costs any more. One of his projects was the &quot;Magic&quot;, which required several expensive machine tools to be built – expenditure that could not be justified relative to the small number that were produced. In contrast, Agfa preferred the opposite approach, of always developing as many models as possible from an existing camera housing.

The &quot;Magic&quot;, although intended for amateur photographers, was relatively expensive at 435 DM. It featured an automatic exposure control system driven by a coupled selenium light meter which could select shutter speeds from 1/30 sec to 1/300 sec and apertures from f/3.5 to f/22. There were only two manual controls: one for focusing, the other for selecting either a shutter speed of 1/30 sec (for flash photography), or Brief (for long-exposure night photography). Its successor, the &quot;Magic II&quot;, cost 498 DM and also featured manual exposure control.

===== TLR accessories =====
Some accessories manufactured for Rollei TLRs:
* &quot;: A set of close-up lenses, in three magnifications (Rolleinar 1, Rolleinar 2, and Rolleinar 3). A pair of Rolleinar lenses are placed on both the viewing and taking lenses.
* &quot;: A soft focus lens for the taking lens only available in two grades, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, which softens the definition and produce striking halo effects, particularly when used with back lighting. The Rolleisoft lens has concentric circles ground in groves and is used principally for portraiture.
* &quot;: Instead of screwing the camera body to a tripod, this tripod head clamps down on the TLR.
* &quot;: Rollei&#x27;s polarizing filter.
* &quot;: Allows the use of 35 mm film.
* Rollei panorama head: Attaches the camera to a tripod, and enables the photographer to take a series of aligned pictures to create a panoramic photo in an arc up to 360°.
* Rollei pistol grip
* &quot;: underwater housing.

==== The situation around 1960 ====
By the end of 1950s, the market for twin-lens medium format cameras had gradually become saturated. More and more amateur photographers and photojournalists were using 35 mm format cameras, while studio photographers preferred single-lens medium format cameras. Although they were more expensive, single-lens cameras offered film holders, which could quickly be swapped (an assistant loaded the film), as well as interchangeable lenses.

Hasselblad was the market leader in this segment. The Swedish company introduced their first camera, the &quot;Hasselblad 1600F&quot;, in 1948. However, this model was regarded as being technically inferior because its shutter was unreliable. To solve this problem, the &quot;1000F&quot; was released in 1952 with a reduced shutter speed range, but the focal-plane shutter was still prone to failure. While it was no threat to the fully developed &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; to begin with, that situation changed when the legendary &quot;Hasselblad 500C&quot; featuring a Compur leaf shutter appeared in 1957. The management of Rollei under Horst Franke were caught napping, having failed to produce a camera that could match the latest Hasselblad. As a consequence, sales plummeted and the company got into financial difficulties. In the end, Horst Franke relinquished his position as general manager.

==== New products ====

In 1960, Rollei introduced its first slide projector, the &quot;P11&quot;. It included two slide trays: the left-hand tray was for 35 mm (5 cm×5 cm) slides, the right-hand tray was for medium format (7 cm×7 cm) slides. The &quot;Rollei Universal Projector&quot; sold for 398.60 DM, plus 97.50 DM for a standard lens. The &quot;P11&quot; remained in production until 1978; many more projectors were subsequently added to the range, providing a major boost to Rollei&#x27;s turnover.
In 1963, Rollei introduced the &quot;Rollei 16&quot;, its first all-new camera design since the war. It was a 16 mm camera in the format 12 mm × 17 mm with a Tessar f/2.8, 25 mm lens and cost 425 DM. In retrospect, it seems unlikely that such an unusual format might return Rollei to profitability. However, the German camera industry believed that this was the way forward, and both Leica and Wirgin (through their &quot;Edixa&quot; brand) produced similar designs.
The &quot;Rollei 16&quot; used special &quot;Super 16&quot; film cartridges with a capacity of 18 frames. As no film manufacturer was interested in making this film format, Rollei had to manufacture the film itself. A roll of B/W film cost 5 DM, while slide film (available until 1981) cost 12.50 DM, including development. Loading the film simply required inserting the leader into the appropriate slot in the camera. Since there was no take-up spool, the film coiled up loosely on itself. Without a doubt, limited film choice and availability adversely affected camera sales, consequently only 25,000 units were produced. As Rollei also spent a lot on advertising, this camera did little to alleviate its dire financial situation. Reliance on a film format that Kodak, the market leader, did not support was foolhardy. Needless to say, the quality of the engineering in the &quot;Rollei 16&quot; matched its high price; it had a push-pull viewfinder with automatic parallax correction up to 40 cm, whereby extending the viewfinder also wound on the film and cocked the shutter. In addition, &quot;Mutar&quot; wide-angle (0.5×) and telephoto (1.7×) conversion lenses were available as accessories. An improved successor, the &quot;Rollei 16S&quot;, was released in 1965.

=== 1964 to 1974 – Peesel era ===

==== Reorganisation of the product line ====
To help return the company to profitability, Rollei&#x27;s management sought advice from a number of experts. One of them, Heinrich Peesel, a physicist from Hamburg, produced a concise, 5-page report that so impressed Rollei management that they offered him the chairmanship of the board, thereby accepting that far-reaching changes were necessary.

Peesel, then 38 years old, thus succeeded Horst Franke as chairman of the board on 1 January 1964. He promptly set Rollei onto an extremely risky course, which, despite some early successes, ultimately ended in a complete fiasco. His basic philosophy was to explore all possible avenues in photography rather than concentrate on a single product line.

His approach was diametrically opposite to the company&#x27;s previous management policy, as illustrated by the following example; when the British occupation forces queried Rollei as to the secret of their success, the response was: &quot;there was no secret – it was the result of 25 years experience and concentrating on a single camera type&quot;.

Peesel asked to see all the plans for new products so that he could evaluate them. But in reality, few were actually built:
*the &quot;Rollei 35&quot;, a miniature camera that used industry standard 35 mm film
*the &quot;SL 66&quot;, a competitor to the &quot;Hasselblad 500C&quot;
*the &quot;Rolleiscop&quot; slide projector

The &quot;Rolleiscop&quot; was a compact, upright slide projector that transported slides via a gravity-fed, conveyor belt system. The slides were stacked one behind the other into proprietary, slotless magazines. Each had a capacity of 32 slides (with glass frames), or 72 slides (with cardboard frames). Different sized slides could be mixed together as long as their frames were of uniform thickness and not warped.

Peesel also increased the advertising budget significantly and reorganised production to improve efficiency. In addition, he laid off 110 out of 120 supervisors and instigated a company-wide employee suggestion scheme. Rollei&#x27;s new products found favour with its customers, which helped to boost its annual turnover by 30% in comparison to 1963 – the year that the company posted losses in the midst of the first economic downturn since the war. Turnover increased from 24 million DM in 1964 to 85 million DM in 1970. Others products that followed were less successful, yet the company kept on building new factories that were inappropriate to the size of their business.

==== Rolleiflex SL66 ====

Although there had been speculation in the trade press over a future &quot;Super Rolleiflex&quot; for some time, it was not until 1966 that the &quot;Rolleiflex SL66&quot; finally appeared, &quot;SL&quot; being an abbreviation for &quot;single lens&quot;. It was a sophisticated system camera, a camera at the heart of an extensive range of interchangeable components. The &quot;SL66&quot; had built-in bellows, as well as a pivoting front (lens) standard that could be tilted back and forth by 8°, thus allowing the region of sharpness to be manipulated according to the Scheimpflug principle. In addition, the lens could be mounted in reverse, thereby enabling macrophotography without additional equipment. With the normal lens reversed and the bellows extended by 50 mm, close-up photography with a magnification ratio of 1.5× was possible. An &quot;SL66&quot; fitted with a normal lens (f/2.8, 80mm) cost 2,778 DM, and several interchangeable lenses were available: 
* &quot;Distagon&quot; f/4, 50 mm (1,075 DM)
*&quot;Sonnar&quot; f/4, 150 mm (1,075 DM)
*&quot;Sonnar&quot; f/5.6, 250 mm (1,075 DM)
*&quot;Tele-Tessar&quot; f/5.6, 500 mm (2,263 DM)
*&quot;Mirotar&quot; f/5.6, 1000 mm (4,537 DM) 
*&quot;S-Planar (Macro)&quot; f/5.6, 120 mm (1,250 DM)

At long last, Rollei had a camera that could match the &quot;Hasselbad 500C&quot;. Indeed, had it been released earlier, around 1960 say, it could have been enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines – not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the &quot;SL66&quot; never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the &quot;SL66&quot; camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the &quot;SL66E&quot;, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the &quot;Fisheye-Distagon&quot; (f/3.5, 30 mm), the &quot;Distagon&quot; (f/4, 40 mm), and the &quot;Sonnar&quot; (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including close-up lenses, extension bellows, a Polaroid film cassette, a sheet film cassette, an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the &quot;SL66-X&quot;, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the &quot;SL66-SE&quot; (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the &quot;SE Exclusive Professional&quot; incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the &quot;SL66&quot; series.

==== Rollei 35 ====
For its time, the &quot;Rollei 35&quot; was the smallest camera that used standard 35 mm film cartridges, which made it an ideal second camera for amateur photographers. Initially, it came with a Zeiss &quot;Tessar&quot; lens with an aperture of f/3.5 and focal length of 40 mm. In contrast to 16 mm cameras (especially pocket cameras that came along later), there was no need to work with two different film formats, which was especially convenient for showing slides. Equally important, image quality was not compromised, despite the pocket camera format. Over time, several &quot;Rollei 35&quot; models were released; especially notable was the &quot;35S&quot; which had a 5-element Zeiss &quot;Sonnar&quot; f/2.8, 40 mm lens.

==== Rolleiflex SL26 ====

Rollei also produced the &quot;Rolleiflex SL26&quot;, an Instamatic camera with interchangeable lenses. It was widely regarded as the best camera that used 126 film cartridges, even though this film format was only ever intended for beginners. Although Kodak, too, made an Instamatic SLR camera, their primary objective was to draw attention to their brand of film rather than make money from the camera. Despite the high cost of tooling up to manufacture the &quot;SL26&quot;, only around 28,000 were ever made. The &quot;SL26&quot; cost 628.23 DM, and two accessory lenses were available for it: the wide-angle &quot;Pro-Tessar&quot; (f/3.2, 28 mm) costing 232.43 DM, and the &quot;Pro-Tessar&quot; (f/3.2, 28 mm) costing 282.88 DM.

==== Rolleiflex SL35 ====
After 35 mm SLR cameras became popular, Rollei began to develop its own 35 mm product line in 1966; but it was already too late – just as the &quot;SL66&quot; project had been. Rollei now faced competition – not from a small company like Hasselblad, but from large, well-financed Japanese companies who could afford to advertise heavily in glossy magazines and trade journals. What is more, they invited photographic dealers to Japan to view their factories.

The &quot;Rolleiflex SL35&quot; was introduced in 1970; it was quite compact and comparable in price (675 DM) and quality with Japanese cameras. Rollei had modelled its design on the top-selling 35 mm SLR camera of the time, the Pentax Spotmatic, although it did not surpass it in quality.

Rollei introduced a new bayonet lens mount for the &quot;SL35&quot;, the Quick Bayonet Mount (QBM). Besides a choice of two standard f/1.8, 50 mm lenses (either a Zeiss &quot;Planar&quot; or a Schneider &quot;SL-Xenon&quot;), the initial lens range included: 
* &quot;Distagon&quot; , 25 mm
* &quot;Distagon&quot; , 35 mm
* &quot;Sonnar&quot; , 85 mm
* &quot;Tele Tessar&quot; , 135 mm
* &quot;Tele Tessar&quot; , 200 mm

At this point Rollei still lagged behind the large Japanese companies who already offered fish-eye lenses, super-telephoto lenses and zoom lenses. Although few amateur photographers purchased lenses such as these in the early 1970s, from a marketing perspective, statements published in camera reviews like &quot;lenses available with focal lengths from 7.5 mm to 800 mm&quot; sounded more impressive than &quot;... from 25 to 200 mm&quot;. Consequently, Rollei soon expanded their range; by 1973 a total of 16 lenses (all with fixed focal-lengths) were available for the Rolleiflex SL35: 13 from Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen), and 3 from Schneider-Kreuznach.

In 1974 Rollei introduced the &quot;SL350&quot;, the successor to the &quot;SL35&quot;. Despite state-of-the-art open-aperture metering, which was promoted with the catch-phrase &quot;concentration on the essentials&quot;, sales of the camera were rather poor. In 1976 Rollei unexpectedly withdrew the &quot;SL350&quot; (the last 35 mm camera &quot;Made in Germany&quot; until Rollei went bankrupt) from sale in favour of the &quot;SL35 M&quot; – a camera derived from obsolete technology acquired through Rollei&#x27;s purchase of Zeiss Ikon. In comparison to the elegant design of the &quot;SL35&quot;, the &quot;SL35 M&quot; was clumsy and unreliable. Next, Rollei went on to develop the &quot;SL35 ME&quot;, its first SLR with aperture priority metering – some four years after the Japanese. Low-cost mass production in Singapore allowed Rollei to offer the &quot;SL35 ME&quot; at a very attractive price. In spite of this, sales were well below expectations. Rollei&#x27;s research and development department continued to follow the basic philosophy it had established for its medium format cameras: adding more electronics. In 1978, Rollei introduced a new, electronically controlled camera, the &quot;SL35 E&quot;. However, it lacked the reliability that was now expected of consumer products. One weak point, for example, was the mirror mechanism.

After Canon introduced the &quot;AE-1&quot; (the first 35 mm SLR to include a micro-processor), and Minolta introduced the &quot;XD-7&quot; (the first SLR to feature multiple automatic exposure modes – shutter priority and aperture priority), camera buyers lost interest in Rollei and its products; on the other hand, very few noticed the flaws either. As a result, Rollei was relegated to the fringe, its sales lagging well behind Minolta, Pentax, Canon, Nikon and Contax-Yashica.

In the mid-1970s, third-party lenses increased in popularity. This trend made it difficult for Rollei to maintain its declining market share because third-party lens makers were reluctant to produce Rollei-compatible lenses; low sales of Rollei cameras made it uneconomic for them to do so.

As a result, Rollei&#x27;s customer base, which formerly consisted of enthusiastic amateurs, was now dominated by casual photographers. Although they generally preferred German-made products, they were much less inclined to buy expensive camera accessories. Nevertheless, Rollei sold 333,000 units of the &quot;SL35&quot; and 120,000 units of its successor, the &quot;SL35 E&quot;, including sales of virtually identical models from Voigtländer.

==== Rollei 35RF ====

The &quot;Rollei 35RF&quot; was a compact camera with a fixed , 38 mm lens. Despite the similarity in names, this camera should not be confused with its modern (2002) namesake, the &quot;Rollei 35 RF&quot; – a rangefinder camera with a Leica M bayonet lens mount manufactured by Cosina Voigtländer and marketed by &quot;Rollei Fototechnic&quot;.

==== Flash units ====
In 1967, Rollei started to sell flash units, but without much success as this market was already crowded with offerings from other manufacturers – not just other camera makers, but also consumer electronics companies such as Metz.

The Rollei &quot;Strobomatic E66&quot; costing 548 DM was the first electronic flash on the market, but not for long. The &quot;Strobofix&quot;, a similar model without a brightness control, sold for 357 DM. Rollei subsequently released many more variants. In 1968, Rollei introduced flash units for studio photography; there were three models (E250, E1250 and E5000), each with a different flash head. A special feature of Rollei&#x27;s studio flash units was a modeling light – a halogen lamp integrated into the flash head. This helped the photographer to adjust the lighting and select the most appropriate aperture.

==== Super 8 ====

The advent of Super 8 film created a booming home movie market. This development had not gone unnoticed by Peesel, who decided that Rollei, too, should offer products for this new and expanding segment of the market. As Rollei lacked the resources in Braunschweig to develop or manufacture such products itself, it decided instead to resell (under the Rollei brand) products made by (a Bosch subsidiary in Germany) and (in Italy).

==== Uelzen ====
In the meanwhile, Rollei&#x27;s product range had expanded considerably and it had outgrown the factory in Salzdahlumer Straße. Furthermore, recruiting new employees locally in the Braunschweig area had become increasingly difficult as around half of the local workforce was now employed by Volkswagen. Consequently, Peesel embarked on a search for a suitable location for a branch factory, preferably in an underdeveloped area within reach of Braunschweig. He selected Uelzen, a town some distant from Braunschweig; it was within 1 hours drive from Hamburg, Hannover, Braunschweig and Salzgitter, and well-situated on a branch of the Elbe Canal. What is more, as Uelzen lay within the economically depressed East–west border zone, Rollei would qualify for government subsidies.

After purchasing a plot of land, Rollei began construction of new buildings that would provide ) of factory space, with plans for two future building projects. The first stage, completed in 1970, was used to manufacture slide projectors, studio flash systems and, later on, the &quot;Rolleimat Universal&quot; enlarger. However, the factory at Uelzen became redundant after Rollei transferred most of its production to Singapore. The site was put up for sale, but no buyer was found and the factory finally closed on 1 October 1977. The buildings stood empty until 1981.

==== Viewfinder cameras ====

Rollei made other viewfinder cameras besides the &quot;Rollei 16&quot; and the &quot;Rollei 35&quot;, the best-known of which were the &quot;A26&quot; and the &quot;A110 / E110&quot;. The &quot;A26&quot; was the smallest camera that used Instamatic (126) film cartridges. It was cleverly designed, folding together to protect the lens and the viewfinder.

The &quot;A110&quot; was positioned as a successor to the &quot;Rollei 16&quot;; it was a pocket-sized camera that used 110 film cartridges. The A110 was compact, stylish and highly regarded. Later on, Rollei released a cheaper alternative in silver, the &quot;E110&quot;. Both models sold extremely well – the &quot;A26&quot; achieved sales of almost 140,000 units, while over 240,000 pocket cameras were sold.

Between 1977 and 1979, Rollei commissioned a little known Japanese company to manufacture a range of three basic pocket cameras taking 110 film. These were sold under the brand name &quot;Pocketline by Rollei&quot;. However, sales were poor, although precise sales figures are unavailable.

From 1974 onwards, Rollei introduced various 35 mm cameras of conventional design, including the &quot;Rolleimat&quot; and the &quot;Rollei 35XF&quot;. Some were sold under the Voigtländer brand with different model names, while others were made in Japan.

==== Singapore ====
Although wages in Germany were low to begin with, they increased steadily, which prompted Peesel to negotiate an exclusive agreement with the government of Singapore in 1970 to manufacture photographic equipment there. In return, he promised to create 10,000 new jobs by the year 1980.

Clearly, Rollei would not be able to finance an expansion on this scale itself, so it approached two regional German banks – the &quot;Norddeutsche Landesbank&quot; and the &quot;Hessische Landesbank&quot; – who subsequently became shareholders in the company. In those days, risky investments such as this were not that uncommon; Peesel&#x27;s imperious demeanor within Rollei had so impressed the bankers that they were confident of their investment. Only after the collapse of the &quot;Herstatt Bank&quot; did financial institutions become more prudent in their lending.

Rollei&#x27;s factory in Singapore astounded everyone, especially those outside of Germany; at that time not even the Japanese had successfully managed to carry out precision manufacturing on the Asian continent. Although &quot;Rollei Singapore&quot; was fully autonomous, it did not do any product development.

In 1974, Rollei&#x27;s workforce was distributed as follows: 1,648 in Braunschweig, 314 in Uelzen, and 5,696 in Singapore. Although the &quot;Rollei 35&quot; was selling well and all of the production of amateur cameras had been transferred to Singapore, there was insufficient work to keep the enormous workforce busy. Consequently, after a long and draw-out start-up phase, contracts to manufacture on behalf of third-parties were accepted from 1979.

When &quot;Rollei Deutschland&quot; filed for bankruptcy in 1981, Rollei camera products still accounted for 97% of the production capacity in Singapore, which meant that the factory had to close. &quot;USH&quot; (&quot;United Scientific Holdings&quot; – see New owners) established a new company called &quot;Rolloptik Ltd.&quot; in order to purchase and store the plant and machinery. This would make it possible to restart production in Asia later on should this be necessary.

==== Voigtländer ====
The Braunschweig-based camera manufacturer Voigtländer closed down on 23 August 1971, whereupon the German mail-order firm Quelle GmbH &quot;(Foto-Quelle)&quot; entered into take-over negotiations, but no agreement could be reached. In the end, Voigtländer&#x27;s assets were divided according to a scheme devised by Peesel: Rollei, Carl Zeiss and the state of Niedersachsen would each receive one third shares with Rollei retaining exclusive rights to its brand names. As a result, a new company called &quot;Optische Werke Voigtländer&quot; was established on 1 March 1972 with 320 employees to manufacture lenses for both Rollei and Zeiss Ikon cameras. In addition, Rollei took on 300 former Voigtländer employees.

After Zeiss Ikon stopped making cameras in 1972, the company &quot;Voigtländer Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH&quot; was established in 1974 purely to sell cameras. There was, however, no clear distinction between Voigtländer and Rollei cameras, and many models were sold under both brand names. This even applied to 35 mm SLR cameras, whereby their common lens mount was now referred to as the &quot;Rollei/Voigtländer bayonet&quot;. Although the trade press regarded the takeover as a long overdue consolidation of the camera industry in Braunschweig, the merger made no sense from a business perspective; from it Rollei gained neither new products nor new customers, nor did it have any use for the additional production capacity and employees it acquired – all the more because the factory in Singapore was under-utilised.

=== 1975 to 1981 – Peperzak / Wehling / Porst era ===

==== Downsizing the company ====
On 26 August 1974, after Rollei made a loss of 37 million DM on revenue of just 137 million DM, Peesel left the company &quot;by mutual agreement&quot;. At this point Rollei&#x27;s debts amounted to around 500 million DM, which meant that the banks effectively owned 97% of the company. The banks considered liquidating Rollei, but decided instead that restructuring the company would be more worthwhile, setting out the following requirements: 
*Reducing the workforce in Singapore by 50%
*Reducing the workforce in Braunschweig by 500
*Selling the factory in Uelzen
*Winding up the company &quot;Optische Werke Voigtländer&quot;
As a result, in the first half of 1975, the combined workforce (of both Rollei and Voigtländer) was reduced from 2,400 to 1,800 employees. On 1 April, Peter Canisius Josef Peperzak, the former head of Canon in Germany, took over the leadership of Rollei with the intention of fundamentally changing its pricing and marketing policy.

==== Rolleiflex SLX ====

Rollei had already shown the &quot;Rolleiflex SLX&quot; to selected journalists in Singapore in 1973, and presented it at photokina (Germany) in 1974, but this innovative camera did not go into production until September 1976. It was the first microprocessor-controlled medium format camera in the world, whereby the aperture and shutter speed were set electronically via two linear electric motors built into the lens. This technology was expensive and rather unreliable to begin with, but the advantages were compelling nonetheless. An updated model with improved electronics was subsequently released in 1978. Most importantly, these innovations allowed Rollei to distinguish itself from Hasselblad. Its Swedish rival promoted the extraordinary reliability of its cameras, as shown by the role Hasselblad cameras played in the missions to the Moon – publicity that was impossible to trump. Rollei, on the other hand, emphasised the advanced electronics and ease of use of its cameras. The &quot;SLX&quot; lacked an exchangeable film magazine, although a Polaroid back was available. When it was introduced, the &quot;SLX&quot; cost 5,998 DM.

==== Dissolve projectors ====
At &quot;photokina 1976&quot;, Rollei presented the &quot;Rollei P3800&quot;, the first 35 mm slide projector in the world with on-board dissolve capability, using two projection lenses. This product generated renewed interest in the company, because, prior to this, dissolving required two projectors connected to a special controller. But the &quot;P3800&quot; made this effortless, like running a normal slide-show. Above all, there was no longer any need to alternately load the slides into two magazines. The &quot;P3800&quot; was made in Singapore starting from 1980 and cost 1,000 DM.

Several successors followed, including the &quot;Rolleivision 35 twin&quot; (1986), MSC 300/300P (1995–1998), MSC 310/320s/330P (1998–2003), MSC 315/325P and 535P (2003–2014); the final generation of &quot;Rolleivision twin&quot; projectors also includes the 535P, a &quot;P&quot;rofessional (or &quot;P&quot;rogrammable) version which uses 250 watt bulbs.

==== Rolleimatic ====
The &quot;Rolleimatic&quot; was the last new camera to go into production before Rollei went bankrupt. It was conceived as a 35 mm viewfinder camera of new design that would be (almost) as easy to use as cameras that used Instamatic film cassettes, but delivering better image quality. Planning started in 1977 and the cameras were manufactured between June 1980 and September 1981. 
The &quot;Rolleimatic&quot; was released onto the market without being subjected to the extensive testing that was usual, with the result that it suffered from unreliability, just like the &quot;SL35E&quot; had before it. Rollei&#x27;s bankruptcy brought production to an early end.

==== Under Nord/LB management ====
Perzak&#x27;s behaviour became increasingly erratic; in an attempt to save the factory at Uelzen, he got Kaiser Fototechnik in Buchen to develop an enlarger, which Rollei sold as the &quot;Rolleimat Universal&quot;. Although it was extremely popular, the market for amateur photo-laboratories was much too small to make any difference to Rollei. Furthermore, for some obscure reason, he purchased tripods and 35 mm lenses from Japanese companies, fixed focal length lenses from Mamiya, and zoom lenses from Tokina – even though Rollei had enough spare production capacity in Singapore to make them all itself. With the new &quot;Rolleinar&quot; 35 mm lenses, Rollei was finally able to match the range of focal lengths offered by its competitors. On top of that, Peperzak cancelled Rollei&#x27;s appearance at photokina 1978. In the end, he left Rollei on 28 February.

The Norddeutsche Landesbank (Nord/LB) then appointed Heinz Wehling to manage the company on 1 March 1978. So, Rollei was able to exhibit at photokina after all, but not in its customary location – that had already been allocated. He negotiated a contract with IEC, the &quot;Industria De Equipamentos Cinematograficos S. A.&quot; in São Leopoldo, Brazil to manufacture Rollei slide projectors and enlargers under license. Unfortunately, Wehling was no more successful than his predecessor; in particular, he remained committed to 35 mm SLR cameras, even developing a new camera for the range, and steadfastly refused to close the factory in Singapore. Rollei was now perilously close to bankruptcy, so the search began for a new owner.

==== Hannsheinz Porst ====
Obviously, the new owner could not be a Japanese company. Since neither Agfa, Kodak nor Zeiss were interested, &quot;Deutsche Fotoholding GmbH&quot;, a company founded by , took over 97% of &quot;Rollei Germany&quot; on 1 April 1981, with the option of purchasing 75% of Nord/LB&#x27;s share of &quot;Rollei Singapore&quot; in 1982. The chairman of Nord/LB&#x27;s board of directors greeted this event with the words, &quot;Thank goodness, I am finally rid of Rollei...&quot;.

The takeover by Hannsheinz Porst was met with universal astonishment as his own company &quot;&quot; was already in trouble. Also, many wondered who, actually, was behind the holding company. Rumour had it that Agfa had taken a share in order to avoid restrictions from the German Federal Cartel Office. The management of Rollei was shared between Otto Stemmer, a former employee of Agfa who became the technical director, and Hannsheinz Porst, who became chairman of the board.

Porst announced his strategy for the company:
*withdrawal from the pocket camera market, which was declining rapidly
*avoid the bottom end of the market
*35 mm viewfinder cameras
*35 mm and middle format cameras for the top end of the market
*slide projectors
*advanced flash units
*no more Rollei Super 8 cameras, which were hardly selling anyway

Yet nobody took much interest as all confidence in Porst, Rollei and Nord/LB had already been lost. Hannsheinz Porst was especially disappointed when he failed to gain the support of the photographic trade. As a result, Rollei&#x27;s turnover declined by 20% from March 1981. In addition, the Yen and the Singapore Dollar had appreciated strongly in value, which significantly increased the cost of the products that Peperzak had earlier contracted to import from Asia. Mired in debt and close to bankruptcy, Porst finally filed an application on 3 July 1981 in the District Court of Braunschweig to put Rollei into voluntary administration. The court-appointed administrator announced that Rollei&#x27;s professional products and services division would be retained, that production would continue until the end of September, and that some employees would be laid off in October. The estimated value of Rollei&#x27;s unsold inventory was put at about 100 million DM. An advertising campaign was mounted to sell the remaining stock, and advertisements were placed in photographic magazines highlighting the fact that this would be the last opportunity to buy accessories for older Rollei cameras. The rights to the &quot;Voigtländer&quot; brand name were sold to the Plusfoto Group for 100,000 DM. Some 700 employees were still working for Rollei in 1981.

=== 1982 to 2003 – Rollei Fototechnic / USH / Mandermann / Samsung / Dume / Capitellum era ===

==== New owners ====

On 1 January 1982, Rollei split into three separate companies: &quot;Rollei Deutschland GmbH&quot; assumed responsibility for disposing of the remaining stock and servicing its former products, while &quot;Rollei Gebäude GmbH&quot; together with Nord/LB, its largest creditor, took over its properties and the management of its former production facilities. A new company called &quot;Rollei Fototechnic GmbH&quot; employing 380 workers manufactured, sold and (until 1 July 1983) serviced a &quot;rationalised&quot; range of cameras, lenses and slide projectors. This company, which had nothing more to do with the former Rollei company up until the takeover of its &quot;leading designs&quot;, was 100% owned by &quot;USH&quot; (&quot;United Scientific Holdings&quot;). The London-based &quot;USH&quot; was founded after the war to manufacture optoelectronic instruments. Rollei initially made contact with USH through its Singapore subsidiary, &quot;Avimo Ltd.&quot;

The intention was to collaborate in the development of products for the German military. As a result, Rollei began to make 7×42 binoculars, otherwise &quot;USH&quot; exerted no influence over Rollei&#x27;s camera product line. Rollei simply made the products and received test and measurement instruments from &quot;USH&quot; in return – equipment that it would otherwise have built itself. Consequently, collaboration with &quot;USH&quot; proved to be extremely beneficial to Rollei.
&quot;Rollei Fototechnic GmbH&quot; concentrated on system cameras, which were still made in Braunschweig, and slide projectors, which were made in Singapore until 1983. After that, production of slide projectors was transferred back to Germany so that they, too, could be marketed under the catch phrase &quot;Made in Germany&quot;. The &quot;P801&quot; slide projector was initially made by in Italy, but its successor, as expected, was also made in Braunschweig. These products were manufactured in leased premises within Rollei&#x27;s former factory. Only a quarter of the available space was required; the remainder was utilised by companies unconnected with the photography industry.

After &quot;USH&#x27;s&quot; strategy to manufacture for the military market failed, Rollei was sold to on 10 June 1987 for the symbolic price of 1 DM together with 14 million DM in debts. Mandermann was a German photographic industrialist, who had owned Schneider Kreuznach since 1982.

Early in 1995, Rollei was purchased by &quot;Samsung Techwin&quot;, a part of the South Korean conglomerate &quot;Samsung Group&quot;. After the Asian financial crisis of 1997, Paul Dume and six former Rollei managers purchased Rollei in 1999 in a management buyout. In November 2002, Rollei was taken over by &quot;Capitellum A/S&quot;, a Danish investment company based in Copenhagen.

==== Rolleiflex SL2000F ====

In the summer of 1981, Rollei introduced the &quot;Rolleiflex SL2000F&quot;, a sophisticated SLR camera using the same QBM lenses as the preceding SL35 system. At that time it was the only 35 mm camera that offered interchangeable film backs and dual viewfinders. Development of this camera began in 1975 and a prototype was exhibited at photokina 1978. One year later, however, the project was suspended due to lack of funding, although it was eventually resumed and completed. The features that were borrowed from Rollei&#x27;s medium format cameras certainly attracted interest, but the high price and limited range of accessories put off many potential buyers, even though a full range of lenses with focal lengths from 14 mm to 1000 mm was available. An improved version, the &quot;Rolleiflex 3003&quot;, was introduced at photokina 1984. Rollei eventually withdrew from the SLR market in 1994. By this time, all 35 mm SLRs included autofocus as a standard feature and Rollei was simply no longer able to keep up. The high price of the &quot;SL 2000F / 3003&quot; range meant that it only ever appealed to serious amateurs, with the result that only 15,000 units were sold.

==== Rollei Metric ====

In 1986, Rollei started making metric surveying systems. This project was instigated by , a research associate at Rollei who wanted a camera adapted for the purpose of photogrammetry. Accordingly, especially calibrated cameras were developed along with computer programmes to analyse the resultant images: the &quot;35 metric&quot;, the &quot;3003 metric&quot; and the &quot;6006 metric&quot; cameras incorporated a glass plate in front of the back plane inscribed with grid lines which – as famously shown on the photographs taken during the Apollo Moon missions – were visible on the photographic image. Rollei&#x27;s system was substantially cheaper than other high-end systems of the time. There was close collaboration with the Braunschweig University of Technology on this project.

==== &quot;Classic&quot; project ====
Interest in twin-lens Rollei cameras declined in the 1970s so much that the Rolleicord was discontinued in 1976, while the Rolleiflex was only available on special order from 1977. Although there was some revival in interest shortly thereafter, production ceased altogether after Rollei went into voluntary administration. Nonetheless, 1,250 gold-plated Rolleiflexes were assembled in 1982 from the remaining componentry and sold as the &quot;2.8F Gold&quot; for 4,000 DM. In 1987, a much-admired successor, the &quot;Rolleiflex 2.8 GX&quot;, was released which naturally featured the latest in TTL and flash metering. The &quot;2.8 GX&quot; sold for 2,800 DM, which was not exactly cheap, but a reasonable price considering the low production volumes.

Rollei then introduced the &quot;2.8 FX&quot; in 2001, a modernised version featuring the &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; logo of the 1930s. In fact, a wide-angled version of this camera is available once more. So, the number of Rollei cameras produced increased yet further – albeit slowly – reaching a total of 3.2 million units. Similarly, a classic version of the &quot;Rollei 35&quot; was available for a period of time: the &quot;Rollei 35 classic&quot; was presented at photokina 1990 and sold for 2,200 DM with a flash unit. See Rollei 35.

==== Rollei rangefinders ====
Following a trend towards rangefinder cameras, Rollei introduced the QZ 35T/35W fixed-lens autofocus cameras that featured an electronic rangefinder, similar to the competing Contax G line of cameras. These were sophisticated, titanium-clad point and shoot cameras priced for the luxury market, designed by F.A. Porsche, featuring a broad range of shutter speeds and autoexposure modes. They were sold in two versions: the 35T had a 38~90 mm ~5.6 lens, while the 35W had a 28~60 mm ~5.6 lens, both branded &quot;S- VarioApogon&quot;.

The firm followed the rangefinder trend and introduced the &quot;Rollei 35 RF&quot; in 2002. Yet the &quot;35 RF&quot; was neither developed by Rollei, nor was it based on any of the earlier variants of the &quot;Rollei 35&quot;. Instead, it was derived from the Cosina Voigtländer &quot;Bessa R&quot; series of rangefinder cameras; The Rollei 35 was nearly identical to the camera sold as the &quot;Voigtländer Bessa R2&quot;. Like the Voigtländer Bessa R-series and Zeiss Ikon cameras from Cosina, it utilised a bayonet lens mount derived from the Leica M3. Rollei offered three lenses of its own design made by Zeiss. The &quot;Rollei 35 RF&quot; is no longer in production, and it appears that not many were sold.

==== Prego cameras ====

Despite an earlier resolution to avoid the mass market, Rollei began to sell a range of viewfinder cameras for the amateur market. The cameras were made in Asia by Skanhex, Premier, Kyocera and Ricoh, among others, and sold under the brand name &quot;Rollei Prego&quot;. The product line initially consisted solely of 35 mm cameras; digital cameras were added later on – Rollei even began to develop these itself.

==== Single-lens medium format systems ====

Single-lens medium format cameras represented Rollei&#x27;s most important market segment. Consequently, development of the &quot;SLX&quot; continued, resulting in the Rolleiflex 6000 System which was introduced in 1984 with the &quot;6006&quot;. Significant improvements included a film magazine and TTL flash metering – superior technology that made it the leading medium format camera. The &quot;6002&quot; followed in 1986, an entry-level model without a film magazine along with three inexpensive lenses (f/4, 50 mm; f/2.8, 80 mm; f/4, 150 mm). For the first time Rollei offered low-cost lenses from Asia, although all of the other lenses were still made by Schneider and Zeiss. In 1988, Rollei introduced the &quot;6008&quot;. In addition to improved electronics, this was the first medium format camera to include automatic exposure bracketing; demand for this feature was so great that it led to a five-month lead time. The &quot;6008 SRC 1000&quot; was introduced in 1992, which made exposures of 1/1000 second possible for the first time. The &quot;6008 Integral&quot; followed in 1995, then came the &quot;6008 AF&quot; with auto-focus, and finally the &quot;6008i2&quot; – a stripped-down version of the &quot;AF&quot;. The introduction of the scan-back (an attachment that digitally scanned the image, line by line) launched Rollei into the professional digital imaging market as early as 1991, and with great success.

The latest camera from the company (named Franke &amp; Heidecke since 2006) is the &quot;Hy6&quot;, which was designed by Jenoptik and marketed in collaboration with Sinar and Leaf. This camera is a completely new, hybrid design with both analogue and digital capability. Three different versions are available from Franke &amp; Heidecke, Sinar and Leaf (&quot;Afi&quot;) respectively. Older lenses from the &quot;6000&quot; series can still be used, although the viewfinder and magazine mounts are new. The motor drive within the film back eliminates the need for a mechanical link between the camera and the film magazine.

=== 2004 to 2015 – New Franke &amp; Heidecke / RCP-Technik / DHW era / DW Photo ===

==== Break up ====
In 2004, &quot;Rollei Fototechnic GmbH&quot; hived off its manufacturing to &quot;Rollei Produktion GmbH&quot;. In September 2005, &quot;Rollei Produktion GmbH&quot; changed its name to &quot;Franke &amp; Heidecke GmbH&quot;; among its shareholders were Kai Franke and Rainer Heidecke, both nephews of the original founders. Once again, Franke &amp; Heidecke was manufacturing medium format cameras, projectors, photo-technical accessories and lenses on the old company site in Salzdahlumer Straße in Braunschweig. On 27 February 2009, Franke &amp; Heidecke filed for bankruptcy, resulting in all 131 employees being made redundant on 30 June 2009. Some of the bankruptcy assets were purchased by &quot;DHW Fototechnik GmbH&quot; with a view to partially resuming production.

In the meantime, &quot;Rollei Fototechnic GmbH&quot; changed its name to &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; and was selling Asian-made digital cameras and consumer electronics such as MP3 players and digital video recorders. In 2006, &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; closed its consumer products division.

In 2007/2008, what remained of &quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; (the photogrammetry and custom products divisions) merged with the Danish company Phase One to form &quot;RolleiMetrics&quot;. This company continued manufacturing from its original site in Braunschweig, but was incorporated into &quot;Trimble Holdings GmbH&quot; (Raunheim) as their Metric Imaging Department in 2009.

&quot;Rollei GmbH&quot; continued to manage Rollei&#x27;s rights and licences from its headquarters in Berlin until early 2010.

One of the licensees of the Rollei brand is Hans O. Mahn &amp; Co. KG (Maco Photo Products), who manufactures photographic film under the Rollei label.

==== New owners ====
Hamburg-based &quot;RCP-Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;, which has been selling Rollei-branded consumer products since 2007 under the terms of a Europe-wide licensing agreement, purchased the Rollei brand on 1 January 2010, thereby extending its rights to the brand world-wide.

Rollei&#x27;s product portfolio within RCP-Technik included compact digital cameras (Compactline, Flexline, Powerflex, Sportsline), camcorders (Movieline), digital picture frames, slide and photo scanners, as well as tripods (FotoPro).

Rollei&#x27;s latest products are currently available in Switzerland, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Great Britain, Greece, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. RCP-Technik GmbH established its first subsidiary in Budapest, Hungary on 1 March 2010. Soon thereafter, it opened its second subsidiary in Istanbul, Turkey on 1 April 2010.

On 1 January 2015, &quot;RCP-Technik GmbH&quot; refirmed as &quot;Rollei GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;.

==== DHW ====
DHW Fototechnik (founded in 2009 by Rolf Daus, Katherina and Hans Hartje and Frank Will) in Braunschweig was an exhibitor at photokina 2010 where it showed the &quot;Rolleiflex Hy6&quot;, a hybrid digital back-compatible and 4.5×6 / 6×6 film medium format camera, with integrated TTL-metering and an HFT PQS AF-Xenotar f/2.8, 80 mm standard lens, the twin-lens TLR and the &quot;Rollei 35&quot;.

At photokina 2012, DHW exhibited the revised Rolleiflex Hy6 mod2, a revised Rolleiflex FX-N TLR, and the &quot;DHW Electronic Shutter No. 0 HS1000&quot;, which was based on the former &quot;Rollei Electronic Shutter&quot;. The &quot;Rolleiflex 6008 AF&quot; and &quot;Rolleiflex 6008 integral 2&quot;, the &quot;X-Act2&quot; camera, the &quot;Rollei 35&quot;, and the &quot;Rolleivision&quot; projectors were continued to be sold as well.

In 2014, DHW filed for insolvency and was dissolved in April 2015.

==== DW Photo ====
After DHW&#x27;s insolvency and asset sales, the same management team started the business again with a further reduced number of employees under the name DW Photo. The manufacturing of TLRs and projectors has been dropped to concentrate on the Hy6 system.

<text>Rolleiflex is a long-running and diverse line of high-end cameras originally made by the German company Franke &amp; Heidecke, and later Rollei-Werke.

== History ==
The &quot;Rolleiflex&quot; name is most commonly used to refer to Rollei&#x27;s premier line of medium format twin lens reflex (TLR) cameras. (A companion line intended for amateur photographers, Rolleicord, existed for several decades.) However, a variety of TLRs and SLRs in medium format, and zone focus, and SLR 35 mm, as well as digital formats have also been produced under the Rolleiflex label. The 120 roll film Rolleiflex series is marketed primarily to professional photographers. Rolleiflex cameras have used film formats 117 (Original Rolleiflex), 120 (Standard, Automat, Letter Models, Rollei-Magic, and T model), and 127 (Baby Rolleiflex).

The Rolleiflex TLR film cameras were known for their exceptional build quality, compact size, modest weight, superior optics, durability, simplicity, reliable mechanics and bright viewfinders. The high-quality 7.5 cm focal length lenses, manufactured by Zeiss and Schneider, allowed for a smaller, lighter, more compact camera than their imitators. The highly regarded Zeiss Planar f2.8 and Schneider Xenotar lenses, both 80mm focal length and fast in comparison, are both state of the art optics. Unique to the Rolleiflex Automat and letter model cameras, the mechanical wind mechanism was robust and clever, making film loading semi-automatic and quick. This mechanism started the exposure counter automatically, auto-spaced the 12 or (on the later model F cameras) 24 exposures, and tensioned the shutter; all with less than one full turn of the film advance crank. This makes the Rolleiflex Automat/Letter model cameras very sought-after for shooting fast-paced action, such as street photography.

A range of accessories made this camera a system: panorama head, sun shade, parallax-corrected close-ups lenses, color correction, contrast enhancing, and special effect filters, all mounted with a quick release bayonet, as well as a quick-change tripod attachment. Some professional, amateur, and fine-art photographers still shoot Rolleiflex TLR film cameras with color transparency, color negative, or black-and-white film. The later f2.8 and f3.5 letter models (Planar or Xenotar lens) are highly sought after in the used market, and command the greatest price. Historically there were five focal length cameras available including 5.5 cm Rollei-Wide, 6.0 cm Baby Rollei, 7.5 cm (f:3.5), 8.0 cm (f2.8), and 13.5 cm (f:4 Zeiss Sonnar) Tele-Rolleiflex. Although all Rolleflex cameras can be fine user cameras, there is also an active market for many Rolleiflex models as collectables, and this adds (greatly in some models) to the end price paid, particularly in Japan.

Rolleiflex medium format cameras continued to be produced by DHW Fototechnik up to 2014—a company founded by former Franke &amp; Heidecke employees. DHW Fototechnik announced two new Rolleiflex cameras and a new electronic shutter for photokina 2012. The company filed for insolvency in 2014 and was dissolved in April 2015, ending any further production. The factory production equipment and remaining stocks of parts were auctioned off in late April 2015.

A smaller company was created again with former DHW Fototechnik employees, under the name DW Photo at the same location. DW Photo focuses on producing the Rolleiflex Hy6 mod2 medium format SLR camera (digital &amp; film), servicing existing cameras, including providing firmware and hardware upgrades.

==Notable models==

===TLR models===

====Original Rolleiflex====

This first Rolleiflex was introduced in 1929 after three years of development, and was the company&#x27;s first medium format roll-film camera, which was used with unpopular 117 (B1) film. It was a Twin-Lens Reflex camera.

====Old Standard====
* The &quot;Old Standard&quot; was originally known as simply the &quot;Standard&quot; until the introduction of the New Standard in 1939.
* This model introduced a hinged back and a frame counter. While not automatic, like in the Rolleiflex Automat, the photographer could reset the counter with a small button after reaching the first frame
* Robert Capa used an Old Standard to document World War II.

====Rolleiflex Automat====
* Introduced an automatic film counter; this counter senses the thickness of the film backing to accurately begin counting frames, obviating the need for the ruby window that forced the photographer to read the frame number off the backing paper of the film.
* This model won the Grand Prix award at the Paris World&#x27;s Fair in 1937.
* The first Rolleiflex to offer a Schneider Kreuznach Xenar taking lens as an option, in addition to the Carl Zeiss Tessar.

====Rolleiflex 2.8A====
Incorporated the first 8 cm f2.8 taking lens (an 80 mm &quot;Tessar&quot;, either by Carl Zeiss Jena Zeiss Opton [Oberkochen]) into the Rolleiflex line. It also added an X flash synch contact. Built from 1949 to 1951.

==== Rolleiflex 2.8E ====
Released in October 1956, this was the first model with a built in, uncoupled light meter as an option.

====Rolleiflex T====
Released in 1959, this camera came in a new color of gray. The camera was most successful for it was more affordable to the public. The camera had a 75mm Tessar lens made of lanthanum glass, giving higher resolution and color correction.

====Tele Rolleiflex====
This camera used a 135 mm/f4.0 Carl Zeiss Sonnar taking lens. The introduction to a 1990 sale catalogue by Sotheby&#x27;s auction house in London estimated that approximately 1200 cameras existed at that date.

The new Tele Rolleiflex uses 135mm/f4 Schneider Tele-Xenar taking lens.

====Wide Rolleiflex====
This camera had a 55 mm/f4.0 Carl Zeiss Distagon taking lens. The introduction to a 1990 sale catalogue by Sotheby&#x27;s auction house in London estimated that fewer than 700 such cameras existed at that date. Only 3600 models were originally produced.

The new Wide Rolleiflex uses a 50mm/f4 Schneider Super-Angulon taking lens.

===SLR models===


====Rolleiflex SL66====

Rollei&#x27;s first medium-format SLR, introduced in 1966.

====Rolleiflex SL35====

A 35 mm SLR introduced in 1970.

===Others===
====Rolleiflex miniature Reproductions====

There are two models of miniature Rolleiflex cameras. These are not true Rolleiflex cameras but are miniature reproductions of the Rolleiflex TLR design produced under licence by the German camera manufacturer Minox. The cameras are manufactured by the Japanese company Sharan Megahouse. One model is a miniature digital camera, the other is a miniature Rolleiflex TLR film camera.

The original model, now discontinued, was the Rolleiflex MiniDigi, a miniature reproduction of the TLR Rolleiflex. In many details the camera retained the look of the original, including a waist-level viewfinder and a crank to prepare the camera for the next shot. As the name implies, the camera was a digital reproduction, with the &quot;viewing&quot; lens being a dummy. The camera had a 2 megapixel CMOS sensor in the square format of the traditional TLR. The lens was a 9 mm f/2.8 with five elements, focusing down to 10 cm. The shutter speeds were automatically controlled between 1/15 to 1/400 second, exposure time was automatic. The camera was operated by a single CR2 battery. The storage media were either SD or MMC cards.

This was superseded by the MINOX DCC (Digital Classic Camera) Rolleiflex AF 5.0. The name change brings the current model more firmly in line with the rest of Minox&#x27;s Classic Camera miniature reproduction range. It is visually identical to the original model, but available in both black and red leather finishes. The CMOS sensor has been upgraded to 3 megapixels, with 5.0 megapixels available by interpolation. The taking lens is a 4.9 mm f/2.8; the camera has digital autofocus. The electronic shutter has also been upgraded to a maximum speed of 1/2500 of a second. The camera operates on a single CR2 battery and uses miniSD memory cards.

There was also a 1/3 scale miniature Rolleiflex TLR, using Minox film, producing 36 exposures of 8x11mm format negative.
