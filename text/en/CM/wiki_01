<doc id="1190816" wikidata="Q3042809" url="?curid=1190816" title="Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions">
<text>In mathematics, the interplay between the Galois group &quot;G&quot; of a Galois extension &quot;L&quot; of a number field &quot;K&quot;, and the way the prime ideals &quot;P&quot; of the ring of integers &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; factorise as products of prime ideals of &quot;O&quot;&quot;L&quot;, provides one of the richest parts of algebraic number theory. The splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions is sometimes attributed to David Hilbert by calling it Hilbert theory. There is a geometric analogue, for ramified coverings of Riemann surfaces, which is simpler in that only one kind of subgroup of &quot;G&quot; need be considered, rather than two. This was certainly familiar before Hilbert.

== Definitions ==
Let &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; be a finite extension of number fields, and let &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;OL&quot; be the corresponding ring of integers of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, respectively, which are defined to be the integral closure of the integers Z in the field in question.
: formula_1
Finally, let &quot;p&quot; be a non-zero prime ideal in &quot;OK&quot;, or equivalently, a maximal ideal, so that the residue &quot;OK&quot;/&quot;p&quot; is a field.

From the basic theory of one-dimensional rings follows the existence of a unique decomposition
: formula_2

of the ideal &quot;pOL&quot; generated in &quot;OL&quot; by &quot;p&quot; into a product of distinct maximal ideals &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, with multiplicities &quot;e&quot;&quot;j&quot;.

The field &quot;F&quot; = &quot;OK&quot;/&quot;p&quot; naturally embeds into &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;OL&quot;/&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; for every &quot;j&quot;, the degree &quot;f&quot;&quot;j&quot; = [&quot;OL&quot;/&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; : &quot;OK&quot;/&quot;p&quot;] of this residue field extension is called inertia degree of &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; over &quot;p&quot;.

The multiplicity &quot;e&quot;&quot;j&quot; is called ramification index of &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; over &quot;p&quot;. If it is bigger than 1 for some &quot;j&quot;, the field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is called ramified at &quot;p&quot; (or we say that &quot;p&quot; ramifies in &quot;L&quot;, or that it is ramified in &quot;L&quot;). Otherwise, &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is called unramified at &quot;p&quot;. If this is the case then by the Chinese remainder theorem the quotient &quot;OL&quot;/&quot;pOL&quot; is a product of fields &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot;. The extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is ramified in exactly those primes that divide the relative discriminant, hence the extension is unramified in all but finitely many prime ideals.

Multiplicativity of ideal norm implies
: formula_3

If &quot;f&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;j&quot; = 1 for every &quot;j&quot; (and thus &quot;g&quot; = [&quot;L&quot; : &quot;K&quot;]), we say that &quot;p&quot; splits completely in &quot;L&quot;. If &quot;g&quot; = 1 and &quot;f&quot;&quot;1&quot; = 1 (and so &quot;e&quot;&quot;1&quot; = [&quot;L&quot; : &quot;K&quot;]), we say that &quot;p&quot; ramifies completely in &quot;L&quot;. Finally, if &quot;g&quot; = 1 and &quot;e&quot;&quot;1&quot; = 1 (and so &quot;f&quot;&quot;1&quot; = [&quot;L&quot; : &quot;K&quot;]), we say that &quot;p&quot; is inert in &quot;L&quot;.

===The Galois situation===
In the following, the extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is assumed to be a Galois extension. Then the prime avoidance lemma can be used to show the Galois group formula_4 acts transitively on the &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;. That is, the prime ideal factors of &quot;p&quot; in &quot;L&quot; form a single orbit under the automorphisms of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. From this and the unique factorisation theorem, it follows that &quot;f&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;j&quot; and &quot;e&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;j&quot; are independent of &quot;j&quot;; something that certainly need not be the case for extensions that are not Galois. The basic relations then read
: formula_5.
and
: formula_6
The relation above shows that [&quot;L&quot; : &quot;K&quot;]/&quot;ef&quot; equals the number &quot;g&quot; of prime factors of &quot;p&quot; in &quot;OL&quot;. By the orbit-stabilizer formula this number is also equal to |&quot;G&quot;|/|&quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;| for every &quot;j&quot;, where &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, the decomposition group of &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, is the subgroup of elements of &quot;G&quot; sending a given &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; to itself. Since the degree of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; and the order of &quot;G&quot; are equal by basic Galois theory, it follows that the order of the decomposition group &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; is &quot;ef&quot; for every &quot;j&quot;.

This decomposition group contains a subgroup &quot;I&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, called inertia group of &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, consisting of automorphisms of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; that induce the identity automorphism on &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot;. In other words, &quot;I&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the kernel of reduction map formula_7. It can be shown that this map is surjective, and it follows that formula_8 is isomorphic to &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;/&quot;I&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; and the order of the inertia group &quot;I&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; is &quot;e&quot;.

The theory of the Frobenius element goes further, to identify an element of &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;/&quot;I&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; for given &quot;j&quot; which corresponds to the Frobenius automorphism in the Galois group of the finite field extension &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot; /&quot;F&quot;. In the unramified case the order of &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; is &quot;f&quot; and &quot;I&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; is trivial, so the Frobenius element is in this case an element of &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, and thus also an element of &quot;G&quot;. For varying &quot;j&quot;, the groups &quot;D&quot;&quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; are conjugate subgroups inside &quot;G&quot;: Recalling that &quot;G&quot; acts transitively on the &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot;, one checks that if formula_9 maps &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; to &quot;P&quot;&quot;j, formula_10. Therefore, if &quot;G&quot; is an abelian group, the Frobenius element of an unramified prime &quot;P&quot; does not depend on which &quot;P&quot;&quot;j&quot; we take. Furthermore, in the abelian case, associating an unramified prime of &quot;K&quot; to its Frobenius and extending multiplicatively defines a homomorphism from the group of unramified ideals of &quot;K&quot; into &quot;G&quot;. This map, known as the Artin map&quot;&#x27;, is a crucial ingredient of class field theory, which studies the finite abelian extensions of a given number field &quot;K&quot;.

In the geometric analogue, for complex manifolds or algebraic geometry over an algebraically closed field, the concepts of &quot;decomposition group&quot; and &quot;inertia group&quot; coincide. There, given a Galois ramified cover, all but finitely many points have the same number of preimages.

The splitting of primes in extensions that are not Galois may be studied by using a splitting field initially, i.e. a Galois extension that is somewhat larger. For example, cubic fields usually are &#x27;regulated&#x27; by a degree 6 field containing them.

== Example — the Gaussian integers ==

This section describes the splitting of prime ideals in the field extension Q(i)/Q. That is, we take &quot;K&quot; = Q and &quot;L&quot; = Q(i), so &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; is simply Z, and &quot;O&quot;&quot;L&quot; = Z[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers. Although this case is far from representative — after all, Z[i] has unique factorisation, and there aren&#x27;t many imaginary quadratic fields with unique factorization — it exhibits many of the features of the theory.

Writing &quot;G&quot; for the Galois group of Q(i)/Q, and σ for the complex conjugation automorphism in &quot;G&quot;, there are three cases to consider.

=== The prime &quot;p&quot; = 2 ===

The prime 2 of Z ramifies in Z[i]:
:formula_11
The ramification index here is therefore &quot;e&quot; = 2. The residue field is
:formula_12
which is the finite field with two elements. The decomposition group must be equal to all of &quot;G&quot;, since there is only one prime of Z[i] above 2. The inertia group is also all of &quot;G&quot;, since
:formula_13
for any integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, as formula_14 .

In fact, 2 is the &quot;only&quot; prime that ramifies in Z[i], since every prime that ramifies must divide the discriminant of Z[i], which is −4.

=== Primes &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 mod 4 ===

Any prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 mod 4 &quot;splits&quot; into two distinct prime ideals in Z[i]; this is a manifestation of Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares. For example:
:formula_15
The decomposition groups in this case are both the trivial group {1}; indeed the automorphism σ &quot;switches&quot; the two primes (2 + 3i) and (2 − 3i), so it cannot be in the decomposition group of either prime. The inertia group, being a subgroup of the decomposition group, is also the trivial group. There are two residue fields, one for each prime,
:formula_16
which are both isomorphic to the finite field with 13 elements. The Frobenius element is the trivial automorphism; this means that
:formula_17
for any integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

=== Primes &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 mod 4 ===

Any prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 mod 4 remains &quot;inert&quot; in Z[formula_18]; that is, it does &quot;not&quot; split. For example, (7) remains prime in Z[formula_18]. In this situation, the decomposition group is all of &quot;G&quot;, again because there is only one prime factor. However, this situation differs from the &quot;p&quot; = 2 case, because now σ does &quot;not&quot; act trivially on the residue field
:formula_20
which is the finite field with 72 = 49 elements. For example, the difference between formula_21 and formula_22 is formula_23, which is certainly not divisible by 7. Therefore, the inertia group is the trivial group {1}. The Galois group of this residue field over the subfield Z/7Z has order 2, and is generated by the image of the Frobenius element. The Frobenius element is none other than σ; this means that
:formula_24
for any integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

=== Summary ===

== Computing the factorisation ==

Suppose that we wish to determine the factorisation of a prime ideal &quot;P&quot; of &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; into primes of &quot;O&quot;&quot;L&quot;. The following procedure (Neukirch, p. 47) solves this problem in many cases. The strategy is to select an integer θ in &quot;O&quot;&quot;L&quot; so that &quot;L&quot; is generated over &quot;K&quot; by θ (such a θ is guaranteed to exist by the primitive element theorem), and then to examine the minimal polynomial &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of θ over &quot;K&quot;; it is a monic polynomial with coefficients in &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;. Reducing the coefficients of &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) modulo &quot;P&quot;, we obtain a monic polynomial &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) with coefficients in &quot;F&quot;, the (finite) residue field &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;/&quot;P&quot;. Suppose that &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) factorises in the polynomial ring &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] as
: formula_25
where the &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot; are distinct monic irreducible polynomials in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]. Then, as long as &quot;P&quot; is not one of finitely many exceptional primes (the precise condition is described below), the factorisation of &quot;P&quot; has the following form:
: formula_26
where the &quot;Q&quot;&quot;j&quot; are distinct prime ideals of &quot;O&quot;&quot;L&quot;. Furthermore, the inertia degree of each &quot;Q&quot;&quot;j&quot; is equal to the degree of the corresponding polynomial &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot;, and there is an explicit formula for the &quot;Q&quot;&quot;j&quot;:
: formula_27
where &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot; denotes here a lifting of the polynomial &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot; to &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;].
In the Galois case, the inertia degrees are all equal, and the ramification indices &quot;e&quot;1 = ... = &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; are all equal.

The exceptional primes, for which the above result does not necessarily hold, are the ones not relatively prime to the conductor of the ring &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;[θ]. The conductor is defined to be the ideal
: formula_28
it measures how far the order &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;[θ] is from being the whole ring of integers (maximal order) &quot;O&quot;&quot;L&quot;.

A significant caveat is that there exist examples of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; and &quot;P&quot; such that there is &quot;no&quot; available θ that satisfies the above hypotheses (see for example ). Therefore, the algorithm given above cannot be used to factor such &quot;P&quot;, and more sophisticated approaches must be used, such as that described in.

=== An example ===

Consider again the case of the Gaussian integers. We take θ to be the imaginary unit formula_18, with minimal polynomial &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot;2 + 1. Since Z[formula_18] is the whole ring of integers of Q(formula_18), the conductor is the unit ideal, so there are no exceptional primes.

For &quot;P&quot; = (2), we need to work in the field Z/(2)Z, which amounts to factorising the polynomial &quot;X&quot;2 + 1 modulo 2:
: formula_32
Therefore, there is only one prime factor, with inertia degree 1 and ramification index 2, and it is given by
: formula_33

The next case is for &quot;P&quot; = (&quot;p&quot;) for a prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 mod 4. For concreteness we will take &quot;P&quot; = (7). The polynomial &quot;X&quot;2 + 1 is irreducible modulo 7. Therefore, there is only one prime factor, with inertia degree 2 and ramification index 1, and it is given by
: formula_34

The last case is &quot;P&quot; = (&quot;p&quot;) for a prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 mod 4; we will again take &quot;P&quot; = (13). This time we have the factorisation
: formula_35
Therefore, there are &quot;two&quot; prime factors, both with inertia degree and ramification index 1. They are given by
: formula_36
and
: formula_37

<doc id="1190825" wikidata="Q4299620" url="?curid=1190825" title="Tafia">
<text>Tafia (also called guildive) is a drink similar to rum made from sugarcane juice. It is typically unaged whereas rum is typically aged in wooden barrels to reduce the level of fusel. Most of the fusel is absorbed in the first two years. Premium rums are aged for a longer period, incidentally increasing the evaporation of ethanol.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tafia&quot; is possibly an alteration of &quot;ratafia&quot; via aphesis.

Whereas &quot;guildive&quot;, a word of the West Indies, is a corruption from the English &quot;kill-devil&quot; (presumably through a spoken pronunciation, &quot;kill-div&#x27;l&quot;) and is one of various names of tafia in 1799 by &quot;Nemnich Universal European Dictionary of Merchandise&quot;; also, Dutch: &quot;keel duivel&quot;, Danish: &quot;geldyvel&quot;, French: &quot;gueldive&quot;.

Guildive or &quot;inferior rum&quot; is a word that was introduced into the &quot;dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française&quot; in 1762.

==Rum and tafia==
The history of rum and tafia dates back to the 17th century. Both originated on vast sugar plantations in Haiti. This is in dispute some sources attribute it to Barbados. In the colonial era, the rum trade became very lucrative and rum production was a major source of the demand for slaves, who were needed to produce sugar cane. In 18th century Louisiana, sugar was grown more for households and local needs, not as an export crop, although it was used to make tafia for local consumption. Clairin is an analogous spirit produced in Haiti.

Often, both tafia and rum were produced. Tafia is a kind of rum mostly for local consumption, as it is easier and cheaper to make. Rum took more time, effort, and resources to produce, but it was a more profitable product that could be shipped to distant markets, because it refined the taste.

In the making of rum, the juice from sugarcane is boiled down to syrup. This syrup is briskly stirred until crystals form. When the crystal layer is removed, the remainder — molasses — is boiled again and water and yeast are added to the molasses and water mixture and allowed to ferment. Rum made directly from cane juice is known as rhum agricole. The fermented mixture is then distilled. The distilled product is colorless until it is aged in wooden barrels and other natural ingredients like caramel are added.

<text>The Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (IAST: Bhāripa Bahujana Mahāsaṅgha; BBM) was an Indian political party founded by Prakash Ambedkar on 4 July 1994. The party was a splinter group of the Republican Party of India and had its roots in the Scheduled Castes Federation led by B. R. Ambedkar. The president of the party was Prakash Ambedkar. The complete name of the party is Bharatiya Republican Paksha - Bahujan Mahasangh (Republican Party of India - Majority Grand Union). BBM was primarily based in Maharashtra. In 2019, BBM merged into the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, new political party founded by Prakash Ambedkar.

== History ==
The party was formed on 4 July 1994, through a split in the Republican Party of India. The party was led by Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of B. R. Ambedkar.

In the elections to the Maharashtra state assembly 1999 BBM put up 34 candidates. In the 13th Lok Sabha elections during 1999, Ambedkar was elected from the constituency Akola.

In the Lok Sabha election 2004 the party lost its parliamentary representation. In total the party had launched 16 candidates, all from Maharashtra. In Akola, Ambedkar was defeated by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate. BBM totalled 606,827 votes, and won three seats.

In 2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election Baliram Sirskar won from Balapur in Akola on Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh ticket by a margin of 6939 votes.

On 20 March 2018, Prakash Ambedkar founded new political party named the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. On 14 March 2019, Ambedkar has announced the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh will merge with the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. He said that, despite the &#x27;Akola pattern&#x27; of social engineering through the success of the Bharipa-Bahujan Mahasangh, the word &#x27;Bharipa&#x27; (RPI) had limited the expansion of the party. He said that after the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh will merge with the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, because the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi is acceptable in a broad sense. On 8 November 2019, the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangha merged into the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi.

<doc id="1190828" wikidata="Q1378040" url="?curid=1190828" title="Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations">
<text>The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO), formerly known as the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office, is the European Commission&#x27;s department for overseas humanitarian aid and for civil protection. It aims to save and preserve life, prevent and alleviate human suffering and safeguard the integrity and dignity of populations affected by natural disasters and man-made crises. Since September 2019, Janez Lenarčič is serving as Commissioner for Crisis Management in the Von der leyen commission, and since 1 March 2023, Maciej Popowski leads the organisation as the Director-General.

The EU budget of the department as programmed in the EU&#x27;s Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027 amounts to a total of €9.76 billion for the entire seven years. For 2021, the European Commission has adopted its initial annual humanitarian budget of €1.4 billion. Together with its Member States, DG ECHO is a leading humanitarian donor, allocating funding to millions of crisis-affected people in more than 80 countries.

For its humanitarian interventions, DG ECHO usually funds operations through a wide range of around 200 partners (NGOs, UN agencies, and international organisations such as the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. DG ECHO has a strong presence in the field, with a network of some 450 staff in over 500 field offices spread in 40 countries. The field offices provide analysis of existing and forecasted needs in a given country or region, contribute to the development of intervention strategies and policy development, provide technical support to EU-funded operations, and ensure monitoring of these interventions and facilitate donor&#x27;s coordination at field level.

In addition to providing funding to humanitarian aid, DG ECHO is also in charge of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to coordinate the response to disasters in Europe and beyond and contributes to at least 75% of the transport and/or operational costs of deployments. Established in 2001, the Mechanism fosters cooperation among national civil protection authorities across Europe. Currently 37 countries are members of the Mechanism; all 27 EU Member States in addition to Iceland, Norway, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Turkey, Albania, Moldova, Ukraine and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Mechanism was set up to enable coordinated assistance from the participating states to victims of natural and man-made disasters in Europe and elsewhere.

==History==
The European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) was established in 1992 by the Second Delors Commission. With the European Community being abolished in 2009, the office began to be known as the Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission or European Union, but kept its ECHO abbreviation.

After the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012, the Barroso Commission accepted the prize money on behalf of the EU and allocated it to a new initiative called Children of Peace. Approximately €2 million was set aside for the Children of Peace projects in 2013. It was increased to €4 million in 2014.

==Mandate and Principles==

DG ECHO&#x27;s mandate is to provide emergency assistance and relief (in the form of goods and services) to victims of conflict and natural or man-made disasters outside the EU. Its civil protection mandate also extends to disaster prevention and preparedness actions, response and post-crisis operations inside the EU and worldwide.

European humanitarian aid and EU funded humanitarian operations are based on compliance with international law, in particular international humanitarian law, and the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

Humanity means that human suffering must be addressed wherever it is found, with particular attention to the most vulnerable; neutrality means that humanitarian aid must not favour any side in an armed conflict or other dispute;
impartiality means that humanitarian aid must be provided solely on the basis of need, without discrimination; and independence means the autonomy of humanitarian objectives from political, economic, military or other objectives.

In 2007, at the initiative of Commissioner Louis Michel, the European Commission adopted a &quot;European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid&quot; to constitute the first European political text of reference on humanitarian aid. NGOs participated actively to the drafting of the European Consensus and it can be considered &quot;the most comprehensive text and the nearest common position to NGOs&quot;. The European Consensus reaffirms the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. It also stipulates &quot;humanitarian aid is not a management tool for crises management&quot;.

Following its adoption, the Consensus has served as the reference point on the role of humanitarian aid in the EU&#x27;s broader external action. This was reaffirmed at an event marking the ten years of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid in 2017. This is also clearly acknowledged in the Commission Communication on the EU&#x27;s humanitarian action: new challenges, same principles, which was adopted in March 2021.

Additionally, civil protection was adopted as a part of ECHO&#x27;s mandate to ensure better cooperation and protection during disaster among third and regional countries and international organisations.

==Primary and secondary law==
Since the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the EU&#x27;s humanitarian aid action is ruled by Article 214 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Humanitarian aid is a shared parallel competence: this means that the EU conducts an autonomous policy, which neither prevents the Member States from exercising their competences nor makes the EU&#x27;s policy merely “complementary” to those of the Member States. The Lisbon Treaty introduced, for the first time, humanitarian aid as a policy in its own right in the Treaties.

As defined in article 214 TFEU, the EU&#x27;s operations in the field of humanitarian aid are intended to provide ad hoc assistance and relief for people in third countries who are victims of natural or man-made disasters. Article 214 TFEU also makes it clear that EU humanitarian aid operations must be conducted in compliance with the principles of international law and with the principles of impartiality, neutrality and non-discrimination.

The basic act relied upon by DG ECHO to administer EU humanitarian aid finding has been adopted before the Lisbon Treaty and is still mostly in use (setting aside some institutional adaptations to take into account the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty). The 1996 Humanitarian Aid Regulation lays down the objectives and general principles of EU-funded humanitarian aid as well as the procedures for implementing EU-funded humanitarian aid operations. Concerning the latter aspects, the regulation specifies notably the categories of entities eligible to EU humanitarian funding, while referring to the EU Financial Regulation for what concerns most of the contract-related, financial and administrative procedures to be complied with by DG ECHO.

The EU&#x27;s competence in the field of Civil Protection is ruled by Article 196 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union Treaty on the functioning of the European Union. The EU has a supporting competence in the field of civil protection. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, the primary responsibility to protecting people, property and the environment, including cultural heritage, lies with the Member States. As part of the 2019 legislative reform, EU Civil Protection was reinforced with the creation of rescEU. The rescEU capacities are available under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and can be deployed as a last-resort mechanism when Member States are overwhelmed by an emergency. In May 2021, the European Parliament and the Council adopted targeted changes to the legislation. As part of this targeted revision, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre&#x27;s operational coordination and monitoring role for disasters within and outside the Union was enhanced, as well as the EU role in managing rescEU.

== Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) ==
The Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) coordinates the delivery of assistance to disaster stricken countries, such as relief items, expertise, civil protection teams and specialised equipment. Based in Brussels, the Centre ensures the rapid deployment of emergency support and acts as a coordination hub between all EU Member States, the 10 additional Participating States, the affected country, and civil protection and humanitarian experts. The Centre operates 24/7 and can help any country inside or outside the EU affected by a major disaster upon request from the national authorities, a UN body or a relevant international organisation, such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) or the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

The Centre ensures cooperation and coherence of EU action at an inter-institutional level, focusing on coordination mechanisms with the European External Action Service, the Council and EU Member States. It also acts as the central 24/7 contact point when the Solidarity Clause is invoked. It also provides emergency communications and monitoring tools through the Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS), a web-based alert and notification application enabling a real-time exchange of information.

The Centre replaced and extended the functions of the former Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), that was set up in 2013 by then Commission Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva in her role as International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response Commissioner.

The Centre makes use of various Early Warning and Information Systems, including the EU&#x27;s Copernicus earth observation programme. Through the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, the Centre can make use of high resolution satellite maps to monitor events before they happen, and to assess their impact once they have hit an area.

==EU Aid Volunteers==
EU Aid Volunteers brings volunteers and organisations together from different countries (for example, Nepal), providing practical support to humanitarian aid projects and contributing to strengthening local capacity and resilience of disaster-affected communities. Participants in the EU Aid Volunteers initiative must be over 18 years of age and be a citizen of an EU Member State or a long-term resident in the EU. Volunteers receive accommodation and travel expenses, insurance, ongoing learning and development, a monthly allowance, and a resettlement allowance to help with expenses of returning home.

The European Parliament voted in favour of this initiative in February 2014. EU Aid Volunteers supports humanitarian aid organisations. EU Aid Volunteers projects, run by partners of EU-based and non-EU based organisations, strengthen the capacity of non-EU based organisations to prepare for and respond to humanitarian crises and to improve their volunteer management. It also provides funding for technical assistance to EU-based organisations to strengthen their technical capacity and meet the standards and procedures required to deploy EU Aid Volunteers.

Investing in capacity building of humanitarian organisations, local communities and first responders in disaster-affected countries is essential for creating a more effective, principled humanitarian response, which is why it is also supported under the EU Aid Volunteers initiative. As of January 2021, the EU Aid Volunteers programme falls under the responsibility of the European Commission&#x27;s Directorate-General for Education, Audiovisual and Culture (DG EAC) and is managed by the European Commission Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture.

==Budget==

Humanitarian needs kept increasing due to complex crises – often causing massive population displacement – as well as to disasters and epidemic outbreaks. Against this background, DG ECHO has remained a leading humanitarian donor, allocating EUR 2.4 billion to millions of crisis-affected people in more than 80 countries. To address the growing humanitarian funding gap, DG ECHO continued promoting the implementation of the Grand Bargain commitments, notably in relation to multi-sectoral joint needs assessment.

A significant proportion of the EU humanitarian aid was devoted to crisis-affected people inside Syria and its neighbouring countries, including the humanitarian component of the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey. The EU also focused on supporting populations in &quot;forgotten crises”, such as in the Central African Republic, Sudan, Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, Haiti, and the Philippines.

DG ECHO played a leading role in the promotion of a principled humanitarian aid and respect of international humanitarian law. It did so through active advocacy for specific humanitarian crises, but also globally as chair of the Donor Support Group of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and of the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative (with Switzerland).

DG ECHO funds and uses for its evidence-based approach, the INFORM Risk index developed by the Joint Research Centre, and which is becoming the de facto risk assessment methodology for many organisations such as the UN and INGO&#x27;s. The adopted budget for 2021 is set at €1 491 512 450 in commitments for humanitarian aid and €90 203 000 for civil protection.

==Strategy==
On 10 March 2021, the European Commission adopted the Communication “the EU&#x27;s humanitarian action: new challenges, same principles”. The communication sets out a number of key objectives and key actions to address growing humanitarian needs and support a better enabling environment for the delivery of principled humanitarian aid.

Every year, DG ECHO develops a set of priorities in order to co-ordinate its activities efficiently and in an impartial, needs-based approach. To ensure maximum transparency, the department&#x27;s annual humanitarian priorities are available to the public. In order to establish consistency in the allocation of resources to different countries according to their respective needs, and to guarantee the credibility and transparency of humanitarian aid, the European Commission has developed a set of rigorous needs assessment tools.

Additionally, DG ECHO seeks further synergies with the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to engage with, and support, local and national government structures and response systems, including the use of specific tools such as the Civil Protection Prevention and Preparedness Missions.

==Reform==
The former commissioner for aid, Louis Michel, had called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect and on humanitarian principles.

The appointment of a new commissioner with a portfolio for International cooperation, humanitarian aid and crisis response corresponds to articles 214 and 196 of the Treaty of Lisbon where Humanitarian aid and Civil Protection play a sustainable role. ECHO&#x27;s official name was changed to Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection. The transformation of ECHO and the movement of the Civil Protection unit from DG Environment to DG ECHO is a step forward for better cooperation and decision making in a field where rapid reaction is lifesaving.

Clare Short, former British International Development Secretary said the European Commission ran ‘the worst development agency in the world’ and branded its operations ‘an outrage and a disgrace’. Since 2012, the Commission developed an action plan and guidelines on resilience and linking between relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD).

The Commission passed new legislation in 2013 on the EU Civil Protection Mechanism which provides better coordination and support to improve effectiveness of prevention, preparation, and response systems during disasters. The legislation establishes a voluntary pool of pre-committed response capacities and materials, a training network for first responders, and a new approach for disaster risk management from 31 participating states.

The EU Civil Protection Mechanism also established the opening of the new Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC), a civil protection &#x27;hub&#x27; for monitoring disasters and enhancing preparedness and resilience of disaster-prone countries. The most recent uses of the Civil Protection mechanism occurred during flooding in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia in 2014 and evacuating EU nationals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, the Scientific Advice Mechanism to the European Commission delivered a major piece of advice on improving strategic crisis management in the European Union. As well as summarising the historical and current provision within DG-ECHO and elsewhere, the advice recommends &quot;that existing and future legislation and instruments should be integrated in a framework that is capable of dealing with increasingly systemic and large-scale crises in a structural way&quot;.

==European Parliament Report==
The Committee on Development (CD) of the EP commissioned the Overseas Development Institute to undertake a project on the effectiveness of international development assistance from the European Commission in 2010. The project focused on the cases of Cambodia, Mozambique and Peru. The findings and policy suggested can be summarized as follows:
# Harmonisation and alignment (H&amp;A) is crucial for state capacity and should be expanded from sharing and spreading information to increasing joint activities in the short-term.
# Donor harmonisation efforts need to be scaled up to include agreements on joint technical assistance and the streamlining of systems and procedures
# Extremely fragmented aid systems impose unreasonably high transaction costs on the government, drains valuable resources, and fundamentally weakens state capacity.
# EC procedures and structures remain highly complicated and bureaucratic.
# Much of the success or failure of cooperation depends on individual interactions, specific innovators and appropriate staffing levels to carry out the tasks at hand, but the costs are also quite high.
# Country Strategy Papers could improve aid effectiveness — but their quality is uneven.
# Relations between HQ and delegations needs to be improved.

<doc id="1190842" wikidata="Q5249226" url="?curid=1190842" title="Decision analysis">
<text>Decision analysis (DA) is the discipline comprising the philosophy, methodology, and professional practice necessary to address important decisions in a formal manner. Decision analysis includes many procedures, methods, and tools for identifying, clearly representing, and formally assessing important aspects of a decision; for prescribing a recommended course of action by applying the maximum expected-utility axiom to a well-formed representation of the decision; and for translating the formal representation of a decision and its corresponding recommendation into insight for the decision maker, and other corporate and non-corporate stakeholders.

==History==

In 1931, mathematical philosopher Frank Ramsey pioneered the idea of subjective probability as a representation of an individual’s beliefs or uncertainties. Then, in the 1940s, mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern developed an axiomatic basis for utility theory as a way of expressing an individual’s preferences over uncertain outcomes. (This is in contrast to social-choice theory, which addresses the problem of deriving group preferences from individual preferences.) Statistician Leonard Jimmie Savage then developed an alternate axiomatic framework for decision analysis in the early 1950s. The resulting expected-utility theory provides a complete axiomatic basis for decision making under uncertainty.

Once these basic theoretical developments had been established, the methods of decision analysis were then further codified and popularized, becoming widely taught (e.g., in business schools and departments of industrial engineering). A brief and highly accessible introductory text was published in 1968 by decision theorist Howard Raiffa of the Harvard Business School. Subsequently, in 1976, Ralph Keeney and Howard Raiffa extended the basics of utility theory to provide a comprehensive methodology for handling decisions involving trade-offs between multiple objectives. Engineering professor Ron Howard of Stanford University and decision analyst Jim Matheson then published, in 1977, a set of readings on decision analysis; this was expanded into a two-volume set in 1984. Subsequent textbooks and additional developments are documented below under Further reading.

Although decision analysis is inherently interdisciplinary (involving contributions from mathematicians, philosophers, economists, statisticians, and cognitive psychologists), it has historically been considered a branch of operations research. In 1980, the Decision Analysis Society was formed as a special interest group within Operations Research Society of America (ORSA), which later merged with The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) to become the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS). Beginning in 2004, INFORMS has published a dedicated journal for these topics, Decision Analysis.

Following along with these academic developments, decision analysis has also evolved into a mature professional discipline. The method has been used to support business and public-policy decision-making since the late 1950s; applications from 1990-2001 were reviewed in the inaugural issue of Decision Analysis. Decision analysis has been especially widely adopted in the pharmaceutical industry and the oil and gas industry, since both industries regularly need to make large high-risk decisions (e.g., about investing in development of a new drug or making a major acquisition).

==Methodology==

Framing is the front end of decision analysis, which focuses on developing an opportunity statement (what and why), boundary conditions, success measures, a decision hierarchy, strategy table, and action items. It is sometimes believed that the application of decision analysis always requires the use of quantitative methods. In reality, however, many decisions can be made using qualitative tools that are part of the decision-analysis toolbox, such as value-focused thinking, without the need for quantitative methods.

The framing process may lead to the development of an influence diagram or decision tree. These are commonly used graphical representations of decision-analysis problems. These graphical tools are used to represent the alternatives available to the decision maker, the uncertainties they involve, and how well the decision maker&#x27;s objectives would be achieved by various final outcomes. They can also form the basis of a quantitative model when needed. For example, quantitative methods of conducting Bayesian inference and identifying optimal decisions using influence diagrams were developed in the 1980s, and are now incorporated in software.

In a quantitative decision-analysis model, uncertainties are represented through probabilities -- specifically, subjective probabilities. The decision maker&#x27;s attitude to risk is represented by utility functions, and the attitude to trade-offs between conflicting objectives can be expressed using multi-attribute value functions or multi-attribute utility functions (if there is risk involved). (In some cases, utility functions can be replaced by the probability of achieving an uncertain aspiration level or &quot;target&quot;.) Based on the axioms of decision analysis, the best decision to choose is the one whose consequences have the maximum expected utility (or that maximizes the probability of achieving the uncertain aspiration level).

It is sometimes assumed that quantitative decision analysis can be applied only to factors that lend themselves easily to measurement (e.g., in natural units such as dollars). However, quantitative decision analysis and related methods, such as applied information economics, can also be applied even to seemingly intangible factors. 

==Decision analysis as a prescriptive approach==
Prescriptive decision-making research focuses on how to make &quot;optimal&quot; decisions (based on the axioms of rationality), while descriptive decision-making research aims to explain how people actually make decisions (regardless of whether their decisions are &quot;good&quot; or optimal). Unsurprisingly, therefore, there are numerous situations in which decisions made by individuals depart markedly from the decisions that would be recommended by decision analysis.

Some have criticized formal methods of decision analysis for allowing decision makers to avoid taking responsibility for their own decisions, and instead recommend reliance on intuition or &quot;gut feelings&quot;. Moreover, for decisions that must be made under significant time pressure, it is not surprising that formal methods of decision analysis are of little use, with intuition and expertise becoming more important.
However, when time permits, studies have demonstrated that quantitative algorithms for decision making can yield results that are superior to &quot;unaided intuition&quot;. In addition, despite the known biases in the types of human judgments required for decision analysis, research has shown at least a modest benefit of training and feedback in reducing bias.

Critics cite the phenomenon of paralysis by analysis as one possible consequence of over-reliance on decision analysis in organizations (the expense of decision analysis is in itself a factor in the analysis). However, strategies are available to reduce such risk.

There is currently a great deal of interest in quantitative methods for decision making. However, many such methods depart from the axioms of decision analysis, and can therefore generate misleading recommendations under some circumstances, so are not truly prescriptive methods. Some of the most popular of such non-decision-analytic methods include fuzzy-set theory for the representation of uncertainties, and the analytic-hierarchy process for the representation of preferences or value judgments. While there may occasionally be justification for such methods in applications (e.g., based on ease of use), decision analysts would argue for multi-attribute utility theory as the gold standard to which other methods should be compared, based on its rigorous axiomatic basis.

Although decision analysis has been frequently used in support of government decision making, it is important to note that the basic theory applies only to individual decision makers. There is unfortunately no axiomatic prescriptive theory comparable to decision analysis that is specifically designed for group or public-policy decisions. For more on this topic, see group decision-making for discussions of the behavioral issues involved in group decisions, and social choice theory for theoretical considerations that can affect group decisions.

==Applications==
Decision-analytic methods have been used in a wide variety of fields, including business (planning, marketing, negotiation), management, environmental remediation, health care, research, energy, exploration, litigation and dispute resolution, etc. An important early application was a study of the pros and cons of hurricane seeding, undertaken by the Stanford Research Institute in the early 1970s for the Environmental Science Services Administration (a predecessor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).

Decision analysis is today used by major corporations to make multibillion-dollar capital investments. For example, In 2010, Chevron won the Decision Analysis Society Practice Award for its use of decision analysis in all major decisions. In a video detailing Chevron&#x27;s use of decision analysis, Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland notes that &quot;decision analysis is a part of how Chevron does business for a simple, but powerful, reason: it works.&quot; It can also be used to make complex personal decisions, such as planning for retirement, deciding when to have a child, planning a major vacation, or choosing among several possible medical treatments. 

*Energy. Decision analysis has been used to structure the energy objectives for Germany.

*Entrepreneurship. The concept of certainty equivalents from decision analysis was used to design novel and highly efficient mechanisms for funding of new businesses that are desirable to both backers and entrepreneurs.

*Health Care. Decision analysis has been applied to medical decision making regarding breast cancer diagnosis and therapy, treatment of thyroid cancer, and lung cancer. 

*Insurance. Decision analysts have explored the use of insurance as a mechanism to encourage adoption of beneficial health behaviors. The method has also been applied to determine optimal strategies for purchase of long-term care insurance as a function of age, wealth, and risk tolerance. 

*Litigation. Attorneys have used decision analysis to identify strategies likely to lead to beneficial outcomes in litigation. 

*Portfolio Management. Decision analysis has been recommended as a method of improving resource allocations in portfolio management. 

*Military Planning. Decision analysis has been applied to the problem of base closure. 

*Radioactive Waste. Decision analysis has been used to evaluate alternatives for radioactive-waste repositories in both the United States and the United Kingdom. At a smaller scale, it has also been used to evaluate options for dealing with surplus weapons-grade plutonium.

*Research and Development. Decision analysis has been used to recommend portfolios of projects to fund in research and development.

*Terrorism and Homeland Security. Decision analysis has been used to represent the values of both terrorists and defenders to support homeland-security decision making.

<text>The Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail is a collection of championship caliber golf courses, designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr., distributed across the state of Alabama, as part of investments by the Retirement Systems of Alabama. The Trail started with 378 holes at eight sites throughout the state, but has grown to 468 holes at eleven sites.

== History ==
The concept was created and executed by David G. Bronner, CEO of the Retirement Systems of Alabama. The mission was to effectively diversify the assets of the state&#x27;s pension fund and economically help the state of Alabama, the philosophy being that &quot;the stronger the Retirement Systems of Alabama can make Alabama, the stronger the Retirement Systems will be.&quot;

The Trail started with 378 holes at eight sites throughout the state, but has grown to 468 holes at eleven sites.

==LPGA Tour==
Two of the courses currently host events on the LPGA Tour: The Senator course at Capitol Hill near Montgomery, which hosts the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic, and The Crossings course at Magnolia Grove near Mobile, home to the Airbus LPGA Classic.

==PGA Tour==
The Grand National course in Opelika hosted the first PGA Tour event in Alabama since the 1990 PGA Championship, the 2015 Barbasol Championship.

<doc id="1190844" wikidata="Q5384132" url="?curid=1190844" title="Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment">
<text>The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment, also known as the Hatch Amendment or Arnold Amendment, is a proposed United States constitutional amendment that would remove the Constitution&#x27;s requirement that the president and vice president must be natural-born citizens. It was proposed in July 2003 by senator Orrin Hatch, and would allow naturalized citizens to run for either office when they have been citizens for 20 years. The name Arnold Amendment is a reference to Arnold Schwarzenegger, a naturalized citizen and the governor of California from 2003 to 2011.

The text of the amendment reads as follows:

The amendment was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. Hearings were held on October 5, 2004, two months before the end of the second session of the 108th United States Congress, but no further action was taken.

This proposal was widely seen as an attempt to make new California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (born in Austria and naturalized in 1983) eligible for the presidency and is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Arnold Amendment&quot; or &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot;. Other politicians not born as American citizens who would benefit from such an amendment include former Governor of Michigan and United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm (born in Canada), congresswoman Ilhan Omar (born in Somalia), former Secretary of Labor and Transportation Elaine Chao (born in Taiwan), and businessman and head of Department of Government Efficiency Elon Musk (born in South Africa).

Gallup polls from 2003 and 2004 found that a majority of Americans were opposed to the amendment with 28% supporting it and 70% opposing it in 2003 and 31% supporting it and 67% opposing it in 2004.

<text>Prescott was a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States. It was incorporated in 1822 from portions of Pelham and New Salem, and was partially built on Equivalent Lands. It was named in honor of Colonel William Prescott, who commanded the American forces at the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was disincorporated on April 28, 1938, as part of the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir. It was the least populous of the four unincorporated towns, with barely 300 residents by 1900. Upon dissolution, portions of the town were annexed to the adjacent towns of New Salem and Petersham. The majority of the former town (the New Salem portion) is still above water, and is known as the Prescott Peninsula. The public is not allowed on the peninsula except for an annual tour given by the Swift River Valley Historical Society, or for hikes conducted by the Society. None of the land is in Hampshire County any longer; the New Salem portion is in Franklin County; and the Petersham portion is in Worcester County.

As with the nearby town of Dana, after the dissolution of incorporation, houses were moved or razed, but cellar holes remained. The Prescott First Congregational Church, located in the village of Prescott Four Corners, was moved to South Hadley and is now the home of the Joseph Allen Skinner Museum.

The former site of Prescott Center was home to the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory from 1969 to 2011. 

Daniel Shays, leader of the 1787 rebellion which bears his name, was a resident of that part of Pelham which later became the southern part of Prescott. The site of his former home is still above water; but the house was gone by 1927, and in any event the site is inaccessible to the general public. The Conkey Tavern, located roughly to the west of the Shays site, was where the Shays Rebellion was largely planned. Its site is now under water.

The Atkinson Tavern, once the centerpiece of the small village of Atkinson Hollow, stands today, renovated and expanded, in West Springfield, Massachusetts as the Storrowton Tavern, on the grounds owned by the Eastern States Exposition. The former Town Hall, once located just south of Atkinson Hollow, is inaccessible to the general public, and stands today off of Route 32 in Petersham.

The village of North Prescott, on the border between Prescott and New Salem, remains partially open to public access. Although the site of the North Prescott Methodist Episcopal Church is vacant, the former parsonage—now a private home which is not open to the public—remains on its original site. The church building itself is now the home of the Swift River Valley Historical Society in North New Salem, where it was moved in 1985. Prior to this the church stood at its site on the New Salem line until 1949, when it was initially moved to Orange as home of the former Prescott Historical Society. A few other structures remain.

Prescott House, an on-campus living facility at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, is named after the former town.

<text>Greenwich () was a majority Black town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States. The town is one of many Black towns erased in Massachusetts during the period. The reason for the formation of the Quabbin Reservoir on top of it was “to supply Boston&#x27;s growing water needs.”

==History==
Greenwich was established in 1739 as Quabbin, incorporated as Quabbin Parish in 1754, and became the town of Greenwich (named for John Campbell, Duke of Greenwich) in 1754. It was located along the East and Middle branches of the Swift River. The Athol Branch of the Boston and Albany Railroad ran through the center of town, as did Route 21. It was well known for its lakes and ponds, which were popular vacation spots. It bordered four towns—Enfield, Prescott, Dana, and Hardwick.

H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional town of Dunwich in his seminal story &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; was partially based on the town of Greenwich. Additionally, Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; is set in this valley before it was flooded for the reservoir.

Greenwich was disincorporated on April 28, 1938, as part of the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir. Upon disincorporation, portions of the town were annexed to the adjacent towns of Hardwick, New Salem, Petersham, and Ware. (Because of the redrawing of town lines, the land is no longer completely in Hampshire County; only the portion located in Ware is.) Because most of Greenwich was at lower elevation than the surrounding towns, it is now largely submerged, except for the hilltops of Curtis Hill, Mount Lizzie and Mount Pomeroy, which are now islands.

<doc id="1190848" wikidata="Q6781679" url="?curid=1190848" title="Maryport and Carlisle Railway">
<text>The Maryport &amp; Carlisle Railway (M&amp;CR) was an English railway company formed in 1836 which built and operated a small but eventually highly profitable railway to connect Maryport and Carlisle in Cumberland, England. There were many small collieries in the area and efficient access to the harbour at Maryport was important.

The western end, connecting the majority of the collieries to Maryport opened in 1840 and the line was completed throughout to Carlisle in 1845. The considerable resources of coal, and later iron ore, carried by the railway made it especially profitable, and this was redoubled at the height of the iron and steel processing industries around Workington. Branch lines were opened to connect further collieries.

After 1918 the industries on which the line was dependent declined steeply, and the railway declined accordingly; the branch lines closed, but the original main line remains open and forms part of the Cumbrian Coast Line between Carlisle and Barrow in Furness.

==Conception==

Coal had been mined in West Cumberland since the 17th century. Most of the coalfield was south of Maryport, and enjoyed easy access to harbours at Workington and Whitehaven, through which the coal could be shipped. Useful coal deposits were known to exist east of Maryport, as far as Aspatria, but it was difficult to work them profitably, for want of practicable roads. Early in the eighteenth century new collieries started work and in 1749 Humphrey Senhouse lord of the manor constructed a harbour and founded the town of Maryport at the mouth of the River Ellen. His son (also Humphrey Senhouse) was involved in the 1790s in the promotion of a canal from Newcastle upon Tyne to Maryport, but the project lapsed in the financial crisis of 1797. When thoughts turned again in the 1820s to improving the links from Newcastle to Cumberland a Newcastle -Carlisle canal was rejected in favour of a railway. 
Speaking at an 1834 dinner marking the inauguration of gas lighting in Maryport Sir Humphrey Fleming Senhouse &quot;alluded to the situation of Maryport as an inlet for an important district of the country, and strongly urged the importance of a railway to join that now in progress from Carlisle to Newcastle&quot;.


The suggestion was taken up, and in August 1836 George Stephenson visited Maryport, and in October 1836 reported the results of a survey carried out for him, which showed that such a railway was practicable and potentially profitable. Dividends of 18% were promised, and a prospectus was issued; the Maryport and Carlisle Railway obtained its authorising act of Parliament, the (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. ci), on 12 July 1837. The Act asserted that the line &quot;would facilitate the communication between the Continent of Europe and Ireland and the Western Coast of England by forming in conjunction with the Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Carlisle Railway and the Brandlings Junction Railway, one complete and continuous line of communication from the German Ocean to the Irish Sea&quot;. The authorised capital was £180,000.

==Construction and opening==
Construction was relatively easy with little requirement for heavy civil engineering works; however much of the subscribed capital was not forthcoming when the calls were made, the lack of cash severely slowed construction, many shares were forfeit, and the directors resorted to unauthorised borrowing.

=== Maryport to Aspatria ===
The seven-mile section from Maryport to the pits at Arkleby (1¼ miles short of Aspatria) was opened for mineral traffic on 15 July 1840.:

The line ran from the South Quay at Maryport, and the Maryport passenger station was in front of what is now Jubilee Terrace. The line was extended from Arkleby to Aspatria on 12 April 1841. Bridges on the line were built with little more than a foot (0.3m) lateral clearances between bridge and train; much less than came to be the norm in the UK, and as a consequence unwary passengers have in the past stuck their head out of a window and been killed.

The line achieved a major reduction on transport costs in the northern coalfield. It now cost Brayton Colliery 4 shillings per wagon to transport their coal to Maryport by railway, when road transport had formerly cost them 9 shillings per wagon; Gilcrux colliery were now paying half the 7 shillings per wagon road transport had cost them. At that time Whitehaven coal was being sold to the shippers at 16/6 delivered on board. Output from the northern coalfield increased rapidly, and with it the tonnage of coal shipped from Maryport. In 1842, the general manager of Whitehaven Collieries reported &quot;The promoters of the Maryport &amp; Carlisle Railway had the avowed object in view to injure Whitehaven, in which they have been successful&quot;. By 1846, almost as much coal was being shipped out through Maryport as through Whitehaven.

===Carlisle to Wigton===
With the line operating from Maryport to Aspatria, attention turned to construction at the Carlisle end (as was required by the act of Parliament). The section from Carlisle to Wigton was opened on 3 May 1843:

 In the course of the forenoon three trains of carriages arrived from Carlisle, drawn by the &quot;Star&quot;, the new patent engine of Messrs. Hawthorne and Co. of Newcastle... the &quot;Ballantine&quot; and the &quot;Nelson&quot; engines belonging to the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, and which had been lent for the occasion... Soon after one o&#x27;clock, the different trains were filled with passengers, amongst whom were many of the fair sex, who appeared not the least interested of the vast concourse in the proceedings... at twenty-three minutes past one o&#x27;clock, the eldritch scream of the steam whistle warned all that everything was in readiness, and off the first train started, amidst the hearty cheers of the assembled thousands. The other trains started at intervals sufficiently &quot;respectable&quot; to ensure safety from all chance of collision.

The location of the Carlisle station was described as 
... nearly on the site of the ancient hospital of Saint Nicholas. The line here runs parallel, and on the same level, with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, and the trains passing on to that line were carried forward to the Station of that company at London Road-the ancient Gallows Hill.

The connection was with an extension of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, running to the Port Carlisle Canal basin at Caldewgate; this ran to the west of the subsequent line of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, and the M&amp;C station was to the west of the junction &quot;near where Currock Pool formerly stood&quot; in an area known as Bogfield.

===Closing the gap===
This left a gap between Aspatria and Wigton; a wagonette conveyed passengers over the central section by road. The eight-mile gap was closed in two stages; sections at each end, from Aspatria to Low Row and from Wigton to Brookfield, were opened on 2 December 1844. The gap was finally closed in January 1845 for goods traffic, through passenger services commencing 10 Feb 1845. Brookfield closed immediately; Low Row was replaced by a new station at Leegate in 1848. There were initially three through passenger trains each way daily (one &#x27;mixed&#x27; and two &#x27;quick&#x27;); passengers for Whitehaven could avail themselves of a connecting coach service, which left Whitehaven for Maryport two and a quarter hours before the &#x27;quick trains&#x27; left Maryport for Carlisle, and left Maryport for Whitehaven one and a half hours after quick trains left Carlisle. There was no advertised Sunday service, but in May 1846 a second mixed train was added to the weekday service and two Sunday trains introduced.

==Early mismanagement==
The M&amp;CR gained an unenviable reputation in its early years

===&quot;Considerable dissatisfaction on the part of the public&quot; ===
The &quot;Carlisle Journal&quot; repeatedly criticised the management of the M&amp;CR and frequently published letters airing the grievances of the travelling public; &quot;almost daily public complaints of want of accommodation, of irregularity, of notorious incivility somewhere, as well as mismanagement everywhere&quot; according to one correspondent. Reporting on the first train to run from Carlisle to Workington, the &quot;Carlisle Journal&quot; remarked that those used to travelling on the Maryport line would not be surprised to hear that the train set off a quarter of an hour late; relating further mishaps it talked of &quot;the cause of all the bungling on this line -&quot;the want of system&quot;&quot; Even shareholders were disenchanted; their half-yearly meeting in August 1846 heard allegations of open drunkenness of on-duty railway employees going unchecked. Hence the following advertisement:
To The Public
Maryport And Carlisle Railway

Considerable dissatisfaction on the part of the Public having existed for some time past, relative to the management of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway. And it being the unanimous wish of the Directors that every possible attention shall be paid to the convenience and comfort of every Passenger who may travel on this Line, and also that every facility should be given for the regular transit and due delivery of Goods, Parcels, &amp;c., compatible with the existing state of this Railway

&quot;Notice is Hereby Given,&quot;

That prompt attention will be paid to every complaint respecting the irregularity in the arrival and departure of any of the Trains, as well as to any inattention or want of civility to any Passenger, by any officer or servant of the company, arising from intoxication or any other cause, on application to either of the Undersigned, who have recently been appointed Directors, to superintend the affairs of the Railway at the Eastern Terminus... Carlisle, 21 August 1846

===&#x27;Revolution on the Maryport and Carlisle&#x27;===
The directors set up a sub-committee to look into allegations of mismanagement, but before it could report the financial management of the company was attacked at the half-yearly shareholders&#x27; meeting. It emerged that there was no list of shareholders meeting the requirements of Parliament, nor was there any independent audit of accounts (they were looked over by a company director, who also acted as a solicitor for the company, although not officially &quot;the&quot; company solicitor). Two representatives of Newcastle shareholders attended, complaining that shares had been sold in Newcastle by the company at a premium on the assurance of its representative (the solicitor-cum-director) that a dividend of 8% was to be expected; a dividend of 4% had then been declared and this was partly funded by the premium on the shares sold. The company secretary was not an efficient officer - &quot;the time was come when some one ought to be at the head of the Company who is competent to manage its affairs&quot;. The chairman of the sub-committee whilst refusing to go into detail ahead of the submission of their report confirmed that they were satisfied that &quot;it was most essential and important that there should be a thorough change in everything connected with the Company&quot; The &quot;Railway Chronicle&quot; editorialised that &quot;the conduct of the board ... was a specimen of everything that a business-like management could avoid&quot;; the company secretary (who had also been acting as its engineer) was dismissed and a committee of five directors set up to more closely supervise the operation of the railway. The next shareholders&#x27; meeting in February 1847 was told there was no immediate prospect of a dividend being paid (interest payments on the company&#x27;s borrowings, and the running costs of the railway ate up in almost equal measure the operational receipts); the meeting then voted to explore the possibility of amalgamation with the Newcastle and Carlisle or the Lancaster and Carlisle railways. The Newcastle and Carlisle offered to lease the line, paying 5% a year on M&amp;C shares, but negotiations lapsed: matters had improved for the M&amp;C, which found itself able to pay a 3% a year dividend. Results for the first half of 1848, however, showed the M&amp;C to be running at a loss : receipts were down 20% and interest payments were higher; it was therefore resolved to negotiate the leasing of the line by George Hudson, the Railway King and chairman of numerous railway companies chiefly in the east of the country. Hudson proposed a lease of the line by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway from 1 October 1848, matching a lease just taken by Hudson personally of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. He guaranteed the M&amp;CR a dividend of 4%. The offer was accepted by a shareholders&#x27; meeting from which the press were excluded.

As the means by which Hudson had made his money and gained control of so many railways began to be exposed, and to unravel, the Bill authorising lease of the M&amp;CR and the N&amp;CR by an East Coast company was rejected by the Commons as an attempt to monopolise traffic between the North-East and Scotland, and from 1 January 1850 those companies reverted to their own managements&#x27; control.
The exposure of Hudson&#x27;s misdeeds elsewhere, and the renewed necessity to make the M&amp;CR pay its way following the repudiation of Hudson&#x27;s lease led to an investigation of the affairs of the M&amp;C by a committee from which directors were excluded. The committee reported multiple failings of previous and current directors of the company, in some cases involving &#x27;open disregard of the law&#x27;: borrowing before the specified number of shares had been fully paid; misbooking of interest on working capital to capital rather than revenue; failure to identify and book outstanding liabilities against the revenue account; failure to make any allowance for depreciation; appointing company officers on the basis of nepotism, cronyism and patronage rather than fitness for the post; favouritism in the setting of rates for coal traffic (the wisdom of colliery owners being directors - and of allowing directors to influence specific negotiations - was questioned ); failure to state clearly the roles and responsibilities of company officers;division of Company legal work piecemeal between too many solicitors (with the result that &quot;no one person seems to have had a full and accurate knowledge of ...transactions involving the Crown Street station&quot;)

===Trouble with termini – the Crown Street affair===

The original act of Parliament gave the M&amp;CR no powers to deviate from its connection to the N&amp;CR to a more convenient Carlisle terminus. At this time, the route for the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and its partner the Caledonian Railway were being prepared, and the proposed main line to Scotland was arranged to pass to the west of Carlisle (and very close to the Crown Street site) to allow a common central station to serve all the Carlisle railways. The Maryport Company preferred to proceed with its own station at Crown Street on Botchergate. The act authorising this, the (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. xxxvi), received royal assent on the same day (6 June 1844) as the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway&#x27;s act: a clause in the M&amp;CR&#x27;s act established that the powers (such as compulsory purchase) given the L&amp;CR under their act had priority, provided that these powers could not be exercised to prevent the M&amp;CR acquiring the bare minimum of land required for its branch. Litigation then ensued, but although the M&amp;CR lost the case, it succeeded in reaching its Crown Street land by a branch from the Canal line, and opened its station there on 30 December 1844; trains backed into and out of the station.

In May 1845, the four railway companies (Caledonian, L&amp;C, M&amp;C, N&amp;C) finally agreed upon a site for their joint station, but the Maryport negotiators insisted that they should pay only a moderate share of the cost, as they already owned a station close by, which (they argued) might have been extended to form the joint station. Some dispute followed and in September 1846, it was arranged that the joint station should be built at once entirely at the cost of the L&amp;C and the Caledonian; the resulting Citadel station opened in September, 1847. The approach tracks from the south were crossed on the level at least three times by every M&amp;C train movement into or out of Crown Street; if the M&amp;CR train continued to London Road, it made a fourth crossing. This was naturally objected to by the L&amp;CR, which considered the Crown Street station illegal; moreover they required the land for the further development of goods facilities in connection with the Citadel station, and had obtained parliamentary powers to purchase it. The M&amp;C had agreed in writing to sell the land at cost price; it was willing to sell the site for £7,000 but any dispute as to the true value could be settled by a referee appointed by the Board of Trade.

Hudson, once he became the lessee of the M&amp;CR demanded a much higher sum: not just for the land (about six acres), but as compensation for the loss of the passenger traffic and coal trade which it was claimed would follow if the Crown Street station was lost and a new station had to be built at Bogfield (the cost of which he also asked the L&amp;CR to meet). At a two-day hearing held at Carlisle in January 1849 to ascertain the true value, witnesses for the M&amp;CR (all associated with or employed by Hudson-controlled lines) gave their estimates of the appropriate total compensation; all the estimates were over £70,000. After hearing the evidence for the L&amp;CR on agreements previously reached between the companies, the jury awarded the M&amp;CR £7,171 4s 3d for the land, with no compensation for the other items claimed for. The awarded sum was duly paid into court and at the end of February 1849 the M&amp;C was given formal notice to quit. Hudson refused and attempted to get the proceedings quashed. 

At 10 am on 17 March 1849, the Under-sheriff of Cumberland appeared at the station and, after some words with the M&amp;C clerks, the only representatives of the company present, gave possession of it to a solicitor acting for the L&amp;CR. Upon a wave of the latter&#x27;s handkerchief a

strong force of at least 100 men, armed with crow-bars, pick-axes, shovels, &amp;c., rushed from the goods yard of the Lancaster company, to which they had been brought from all parts of the line, to the ground of the Maryport Company, and, without further ceremony, commenced operation by tearing up the rails. This was the work of a few minutes only, as the men were particularly expert. They next pulled down the sheds of the coal and lime depots; and lastly, having allowed the clerks of the Maryport Company sufficient time carry off the books, they gutted the station, which was certainly only a temporary one, and carried away the building! …

In the meantime, a man was posted near to where the Maryport line joins that of the Newcastle and Carlisle Company, and at about 200 yards distance from the station of the former company, to inform the driver of the engine due at half-past 11, that he could not proceed further upon the line. The driver, upon hearing this, immediately drove off to the Gallowhill station of the Newcastle Railway ….

A goods customer subsequently spoke of the M&amp;C consequently using &quot;their old station outside the city&quot; but all M&amp;CR passenger services were now obliged to run to London Road:
The station belonging to the Maryport and Carlisle Railway, situate in Crown Street, Carlisle, having suddenly been Removed by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway on Saturday last, the Market Day, Notice is hereby given that, until further notice, the Maryport and Carlisle trains will run to and from the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway&#x27;s station, London Road. The Public having been put to very great inconvenience by the sudden Removal of the above-named Station, and expressed great dissatisfaction thereon, it is only right to state that the directors of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway were not cognisant of, and consequently in no way to blame in this affair.

After Hudson&#x27;s lease was terminated, the M&amp;CR continued to use London Road as its Carlisle terminus, paying the Newcastle Company £250 a year for the accommodation, until (1 June 1851) Citadel station became the M&amp;CR&#x27;s Carlisle terminus, with trains backing in from the Canal line as they had done in the days of Crown Street. M&amp;CR goods business was then (January 1852) transferred from London Road to &#x27;the Bog Station of the company&#x27;.

On 8 August 1852, a direct M&amp;CR line into the Citadel station was opened, crossing the Canal line on the level, and joining the Lancaster line at the south end of the station. A few weeks later, the Company opened its own goods station west of the new line. This was on Crown Street, but not on the site of the old M&amp;CR station. Although commonly known as Carlisle Crown Street, local papers also referred to it as the Bog Station (although it was not on the site of the original station at Bogfield) to distinguish it from the L&amp;NWR goods depot subsequently built also on Crown Street (and on the site of the old M&amp;CR terminus); in 1924 (after grouping, when company names could no longer be used to distinguish between the depots) the ex-M&amp;CR depot was renamed Carlisle (Bog).

==Reform and recovery==
&quot;It would appear that a worse state of things never was brought to light than this report has revealed to the public&quot; said &quot;Herepath&#x27;s Railway Journal&quot; of the 1850 committee&#x27;s report, but much of the detail was challenged. 
A former company solicitor had helped the investigating committee, and there was charge and counter-charge as to the solicitor&#x27;s role in the company&#x27;s difficulties and hence whether the report was accurate or an exercise in score-settling, mud-slinging and rewriting of history aimed to exonerate him. Nonetheless, a way forward was agreed. Three of the committee were elected directors and sat (with the chairman and three old directors) on a managing committee, which a year later (with a change of chairman) became the company board. Loans were retired by the issue of two tranches of preference shares (which would receive the dividend on ordinary shares, should that be higher): (4% preference (up to the company&#x27;s authorised share capital), 4.5% preference (when authorised capital was increased by the act of Parliament for the direct connection into Citadel).
Passenger traffic was increased by the innovations of season tickets, cheap return tickets and faster trains, although the M&amp;C avoided any timings that might interfere with its profitable goods traffic. Poor performance, poor facilities, and uncompetitive pricing by the M&amp;CR had led to much of the coal raised in the northern coalfield going to Maryport by road, rather than rail; the shortcomings were addressed and the traffic won back. In 1857 (when of the 644,000 tons of coal shipped from West Cumberland 340,000 were shipped through Maryport) a larger dock (the Elizabeth Dock, covering 1.4 hectares) opened at Maryport, served by a short branch of the M&amp;CR, built under the (18 &amp; 19 Vict. c. lxxix) of 26 June 1855. Doubling the track became essential to accommodate the volume of mineral traffic and to facilitate reliable passenger services. This already been done from Maryport to Arkleby by 1847; it was extended to Wigton in 1858 (only after the widening of embankments). Doubling was then undertaken from the Carlisle end, the line being doubled throughout in November 1860 and passed for use by goods and passenger traffic 15 February 1861, double line operation throughout starting the next day. More coal waggons were purchased, and siding capacity increased. Coal exports from Maryport reached 466,000 tons/year by 1866; about 300,000 tons/year of this coming over the M&amp;CR

All expenditure now came under much closer scrutiny - &quot;the advantages of careful auditing are strikingly exemplified in the progress of this company&quot; said the Railway Times in 1853 when the dividend was 4%- but the M&amp;C was not afraid to spend money to save money. To reduce maintenance costs, the original track (56 lb/yd rails laid on stone blocks) was re-laid (with 84 lb/yd rails, fish-jointed and laid on sleepers) as funds permitted over the late 1850s; cast iron wheels on the rolling stock were replaced with (more robust) malleable iron ones. The M&amp;CR was one of the first railways to fuel their locomotives with coal, rather than the more expensive coke (1859); fuel costs for the first half of 1860 were estimated to have been reduced by over £900. In 1864 locomotives were reported to be &#x27;greatly improved&#x27; by the fitting of steel axles and wheel tyres: the M&amp;CR is thought to have been the first UK company to do this.

By 1860 the dividend was 6.5% a year, and M&amp;C shares were selling above par; by 1864 the dividend was 10% a year.

==Expansion==
The M&amp;CR undertook two extensions to their network, both essentially defensive:

===The Bolton loop===

In 1861 the Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway, wished to expand into the coalfield around Mealsgate and promoted a line from their Abbey station. Nothing came of the scheme, but the Maryport and Carlisle Railway was spurred to provide a connection from its own main line. It formed a loop (through the parish of Boltons) from Aspatria through Mealsgate back to the main line at Aikbank Junction. Mealsgate was reached over sustained gradients of 1 in 70 from Aspatria, 1 in 60 from Aikbank. The line opened to goods and mineral traffic on 2 April 1866, but the collieries did not develop as rapidly as had been expected, and the Aikbank end of the loop quickly became disused; track was removed in September 1869. Eventually the coal production picked up and on 1 October 1877 the Aikbank end of the line was reinstated and re-opened. Passenger traffic from Aspatria to Mealsgate began 26 December 1866; the intermediate station of Baggrow led to the name &quot;the Baggra Bus&quot; being given to the branch passenger train. On the reopening of the Aikbank end of the loop, a single daily mixed train ran on that also.

===The Derwent branch===
By the 1860s West Cumberland was producing huge quantities of coal, and (south of the area through which the M&amp;CR ran) of good quality haematite iron ore, free of phosphorus and hence of a composition particularly suitable for the Bessemer process of steel making. An M&amp;C shareholders&#x27; meeting in 1864 was told that 660,000 tons of ore had been mined in 1863, about a quarter of this going to Scotland by rail or by sea. Ironworks set up to smelt the ore locally found West Cumberland coal unsuitable, and better quality coal (or coke) had to be imported. The profits of the incumbent railways were correspondingly excellent; the M&amp;CR over which much of the export of haematite to Scotland took place was paying dividends of 13% in 1873. Larger railway networks from outside the area started to take an interest and to defend its interests the M&amp;CR promoted a Parliamentary Bill in 1865 to amalgamate with or lease five local companies. That found no support from the other companies and did not proceed, but to protect its territory the M&amp;CR had also promoted the Derwent branch of six miles in the same session, and that was authorised on 19 June 1865. It was to run from a junction at Bullgill to Brigham on the Cockermouth and Workington Railway and usefully shorten the route between the West Cumberland orefield and the Solway Viaduct.

While the line was being built, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) acquired the Whitehaven Junction Railway and the Cockermouth and Workington Railway: exactly the outcome the M&amp;CR had hoped to fend off. In self-defence the M&amp;CR deposited a Bill for running powers over those lines that had been friendly before the takeover, but the LNWR negotiated terms on 2 April 1866: the M&amp;CR got running powers east from Brigham to Cockermouth and west to the triangular Marron Junction; and four passenger services were to be operated daily by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR, successor to the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway) from Maryport to Whitehaven in connection with Carlisle trains there. The M&amp;CR also secured a traffic sharing agreement for mineral traffic destined for Scotland: one half of such traffic arising from the ore field would run via Marron Junction, from where the M&amp;CR would convey it northwards; the other half would travel via Whitehaven. The line opened to goods and mineral traffic on 12 April 1867 (about 50,000 tons of iron ore passing over it in the first half of 1868), and to passengers on 1 June 1867 (a through passenger service ran from Maryport to Cockermouth, reversing at Bullgill and again at Brigham).

The Cleator and Workington Junction Railway obtained an Act in 1883 to build a line from Calva Junction, immediately north of Workington, to Brayton, where the Solway Junction Railway made a junction with the M&amp;CR, with a view to getting direct access to Scotland via the Solway Viaduct. This was intended to lessen the dependence of the C&amp;WJR on the L&amp;NWR; in the event the Cleator and Workington came to an agreement with the M&amp;CR, and the new line ran from Calva Junction only to Linefoot, on the M&amp;CR Derwent branch, the M&amp;CR granted running powers between there and Brayton. The line was 6½ miles long and very steeply graded; it opened to mineral traffic on 24 March 1887. A passenger service operated at the southern end, as far as Seaton, but except for a brief (September–November 1908) attempt at a Workington-Linefoot service only excursions and special passenger trains operated throughout,

==Boom and bust for iron==
In the 1880s the iron industry continued to expand considerably, and if the focus of the processing of iron was at Workington, the principal port for export was Maryport. In 1884 Senhouse Dock there further expanded its facilities.

The boom was slowed somewhat by improvements in steel making (particularly the introduction of the Gilchrist Thomas &#x27;basic&#x27; process, which by using a reactive lining allowed Bessemer converters to use ores with higher phosphorus content) and by the availability of cheap iron ore from Spain. However World War I increased demand and impeded overseas supply, so the local industry revived for a time.

After 1918 a steep decline set in, with changes in the structure of the industry and increasing difficulty in mining haematite. One consequence of this was the closure of the Solway Viaduct by the Caledonian Railway which had taken over the Solway Junction Railway; from May 1922 the Maryport and Carlisle Railway worked trains (Abbey Junction to Brayton) on the Caledonian line south of the Solway which was now isolated from the rest of the Caledonian system .

==After Grouping (1923 - )==
The Railways Act 1921 caused the &quot;grouping&quot; of the main line railways of Great Britain; this took effect at the beginning of 1923 and all the railways in the area became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) which at the end of February 1924 shut the Maryport carriage waggon and locomotive shops &#x27;one of the industrial mainstays of the town&#x27;. This coincided with the steepest decline of the local mining and ironworks industries, and unemployment in Maryport reached 77% in 1931. The local railways were dependent on the prosperity of those industries, and many of the marginal routes became unsustainable. The Mealsgate to Aikbank Junction section closed on 1 August 1921, and the remaining Mealsgate to Aspatria section closed to passengers on 22 September 1930; it closed completely on 1 December 1952. The Derwent branch closed completely on 29 April 1935.
Heavy industry in West Cumbria declined post-war, steel-making ceasing in the 1970s, deep-mining of coal in the 1980s, and whilst the main line between Carlisle and Maryport remains in use today the dominant traffic is the passenger service from Carlisle to Whitehaven and (less frequently) Barrow in Furness along the coast.

==Staff, rolling stock and stations==

===Locomotive superintendents===
* John Bulman &quot;fl&quot;.1846 
* Mr George Scott, ? - 1848 
* George Tosh, c1850-1870 : he pioneered the use of steel (instead of iron) in the construction of the company&#x27;s locomotives, notably the boiler/firebox and wheels. This was the first such use in Britain.
* Hugh Smellie, 1870-1878
* J. Campbell, 1878-?
* William Coulthard, 1898-1904
* John Behrens Adamson, 1904-1922

===Locomotives===
The first locomotive was a 2-2-2 was built by the local firm Tulk and Ley of Lowca and delivered to Maryport by sea on a raft. Christened the &quot;Ellen&quot;, she had two cylinders (diameter 12&quot;, stroke 18&quot;) driving her 5-foot driving wheels, and weighed over 12 tons. A second locomotive, the &quot;Brayton&quot; &quot;of immense power&quot; (an 0-6-0 with 4 ft 6in wheels) was delivered in July 1841 to assist with the coal traffic;.

In the following fourteen years five more engines were acquired from Lowca; a 2-2-2 named &quot;Harrison&quot; arrived in 1843, followed by two 0-4-2s: &quot;Lowca&quot; and &quot;Harris&quot; in 1845. A similar engine, named &quot;Cocker&quot; arrived in 1847. The final engine from Tulk and Ley was a 4-2-0 Crampton locomotive, in 1854. This was works no.17 and M&amp;CR no.12. Seven locomotives were purchased from other suppliers, chiefly from R and W Hawthorn.

===Statistics===
An 1857 audit of the rolling stock reported it to consist of: &quot;4 first class, 8 second class, 12 third class, and 1 composite carriages, 7 luggage and break vans, 3 horse boxes; 4 carriage trucks; 19 cattle trucks; 113 goods and other trucks; 20 coke trucks; 482 coal waggons; and 13 locomotive engines&quot;

The 1912 statistics of the line included the following information:
* rolling stock: 28 locomotives, 56 coaching vehicles and 1667 goods vehicles of various kinds
* colours: locomotives - green; carriages - cream with green bodies; wagons - lead colour.

===Location list===

Note: the date of opening of the first portion of the railway to Arkleby, and of the passenger stations on it, are uncertain. A special directors&#x27; train ran on 15 July 1840 but Quick says that the safest date for public opening to passengers is Autumn 1840.

===Private stations===
There were two private stations on the line, at Dovenby and at Crofton;

A private railway station owned by a lady is a novelty even amongst such novelties... About 3 miles north of Cockermouth, in the parish of Bridekirk, lies the beautiful Dovenby Hall. This charming residence and the adjoining estate are the property of Mrs. Ballantyne Dykes, and that lady has had built for her own use and enjoyment a small railway station on her estate. The station is, therefore, absolutely a private one. It is no toy station, either, but a real practical one, and its several rooms and platform are just as well fitted up, and just as properly used, as those of more pretentious stations. There is a booking-office which issues tickets when required, though certainly the &quot;booking-clerk&quot; is not overtaxed, nor has he ever any of the rush familiar to his confrères at Liverpool Street or Waterloo. There is a miniature waiting-room that is often used by the family in residence at the Hall, or by their guests. The small private station of &quot;Dovenby&quot; is on the system of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway, whose whole extent of railway lines does not amount to 50 miles. The private station we are speaking of lies upon what is known as the Derwent branch of the line, and lies between the two more important stations of Papcastle and Dearham. In the summer time Dovenby station is quite a delightful spot, and much more attractive to the traveller than most larger stations.

There is another private railway station on the little line that connects Carlisle and Maryport, beside the one already mentioned existing at Dovenby. This second one is at the village of Crofton, near Wigton. Crofton Hall lies about three miles from the latter town, and its owner is Sir Musgrave Brisco Bart., who enjoys the rights and privileges pertaining to the ownership of a private railway station on his estate. His station is in all respects a private one, not being open to the public at all. When you travel along the line from Carlisle to Curthwaite and get out at the latter station, you are then only a mile away from the pretty private station at Crofton, which is called after the owner&#x27;s place. It is a very nice spot to possess, both the residence and the station. But it would not be true to say that Crofton, despite all its charm and beauty, is actually the prettiest of the private stations dealt with in this article.

===Preservation===
Only one piece of original Maryport &amp; Carlisle rolling stock survives; No. 11 6w Full Third, built in 1875 is preserved on the Chasewater Railway amongst other significant vintage stock. Unlike most vintage 1800s carriages, this one has been preserved with its original underframe because it was sold to a colliery in the 1930s. It is currently awaiting restoration to start with most of the body being intact.

<text>Sir John Benjamin Macneill FRS (1793 – 2 March 1880) was an Irish civil engineer of the 19th century, closely associated with Thomas Telford. His most notable projects were railway schemes in Ireland.

==Life==
He was born in Mountpleasant near the town of Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland.

Macneill started initially as a surveyor and was employed practically in laying out roads and other engineering works since 1816. His survey of the Boyne estuary became the basis of a report by Alexander Nimmo in 1826. During a trip to England in the 1820s he met engineer Thomas Telford who inspired him to become a civil engineer. Indeed, he became Telford&#x27;s chief assistant for 10 years, eventually succeeding Telford as chief engineer on the massive London–Holyhead road project. 
He developed Macneill&#x27;s road indicator in the late 1820s, an instrument for ascertaining the force necessary to draw a carriage over different kinds of roads and pavements, and consequently, the actual condition of the road.

In 1831, Macneill gave evidence to a Parliamentary select committee on the effect of steam carriages on road surfaces.

After Telford&#x27;s death in 1834 Macneill established his own consultancy, based in London and Glasgow, and turned his attention towards railways—his first projects were freight schemes in the Scottish coal and ironfields near Wishaw and Motherwell. He was also consulting engineer at Grangemouth Docks and for various Scottish canal projects.
During the late 1830s and early 1840s, Macneill focused on his native Ireland. He worked on various railway projects, including the Dublin and Drogheda Railway, including plans to extend the railway beyond Drogheda towards Portadown. Much of Ireland&#x27;s modern railway network still follows routes he proposed. For example, the Dublin-Belfast railway line follows the line of the Dublin and Drogheda Railway along the coast (Macneill was knighted in 1844 following its completion) and many of its impressive original structures remain such as the high Boyne Viaduct near Drogheda, built 1851 to 1855, based on ideas developed by William Bindon Blood, the 18-arch, high Craigmore Viaduct near Bessbrook, built 1849 to 1852, and the nearby Egyptian Arch.

Macneill was also a noted teacher of civil engineering (his pupils included Sir Joseph Bazalgette and G. W. Hemans), and in 1842 he was appointed the first Professor of the Practice of Engineering at Trinity College Dublin, a post he held for 10 years.
He was involved with harbour improvements in his birthplace town of Dundalk in the early 1850s, but was not averse to the occasional overseas commission. In 1855, he helped survey part of a route for a railway line linking Europe to India, participating in an expedition to the valley of the River Euphrates.

Closer to home, however, as chief engineer of the Belfast and County Down Railway (founded in 1846), he was responsible for crossing the marshy estuary of the River Quoile (the first bridge was constructed of timber piles driven into the riverbed) to bring the line to Downpatrick in March 1859 (part of the line is still operational from the town&#x27;s railway museum).

Soon after, in April 1860, Macneill was appointed engineer of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, intended to link Lough Foyle and Lough Swilly across the Inishowen peninsula in north Donegal. It was around this period that the Victorians&#x27; enthusiasm for railways began to wane, and the Lough Swilly company was one of many that rarely made a profit. This was disastrous for Macneill as many of his commissions were to be rewarded through share dividends on any profits. He had also unwisely made himself financially liable for calls on shares for unprofitable railway companies. 

With his income dwindling, Macneill became utterly impoverished. A fire in 1857 destroyed the principal industrial enterprise on his estate, the linen-mill and factory employing over 300 men, and this had been uninsured. He was then forced in 1868 to sell Mountpleasant House, his home in north Louth, which he had designed and built, and he moved to Surbiton and then London. He later became blind, abandoned by his friends and pupils, reportedly surviving on a pittance earned from making matchboxes in the single room where he lodged. He died at his son Torquil&#x27;s house in Cromwell Road, south-west London on 2 March 1880. Another son, Telford Macneill, later bought back Mountpleasant House in 1894 and lived there until 1934.

==Legacy==

A commemorative plaque was unveiled on 20 July 2001 at his (previously) unmarked grave in Brompton Cemetery in London. It lies towards the north-east corner of the cemetery.

<text>The London Archives (previously known as the Greater London Record Office 1965–1997, and London Metropolitan Archives 1997–2024) is the principal local government archive repository for the Greater London area, including the City of London. It is administered and financed by the City of London Corporation, and is the largest county record office in the United Kingdom.

The archive is based at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell, London. It attracts over 30,000 visitors a year and deals with a similar number of written enquiries. The London Archives&#x27; extensive holdings amount to over 72 miles of records of local, regional and national importance. With the earliest record dating from 1067, the archive charts the development of the capital into a modern-day major world city.

==History==
The London Archives is an amalgamation of several separate bodies. The first three were the London County Record Office, the London County Council Members Library and the Middlesex County Record Office, which merged in 1965 to form the Greater London Record Office and History Library (GLRO). The GLRO was rebranded as London Metropolitan Archives in 1997, and took over the former Corporation of London Record Office (CLRO) in 2005 and the former Guildhall Library Manuscripts and Prints and Maps sections in 2009. It rebranded as The London Archives in August 2024.

===London County Record Office===
Until 1889, London was still the area within the walled city; to the south of the river was Surrey and Kent and to the north of the city&#x27;s limits was Middlesex. These areas, however, had become densely populated and, given the sphere of influence of the city, traditional boundaries were no longer practical. The County of London was created and controlled by the newly formed London County Council, which took over many of the duties of its predecessor the Metropolitan Board of Works. It was the records of these bodies and similar groups such as the London School Board and Metropolitan Asylums Board that would form the nucleus of the London County Record offices holdings, which were based at County Hall on the south bank of the River Thames.

As well as the official records that the council generated, they also began to accept deposits of records fundamental to London&#x27;s history, such as copies of memorials from the Middlesex Deeds Register, diocesan and parish records and records of charities such as the Foundling Hospital. Under the Public Records Act 1958, the record office became recognised as a place of deposit for public records relating to the London area, including hospitals and courts.

Since the creation of the London County Council there had been a record keeper in the Clerks Department who held custody of the documents. By the 1930s they had established individual departmental record rooms staffed by record assistants working under the general supervision of the Record Keeper. Finally, in 1953 the position of Head Archivist and Librarian was created.

===London County Council Members Library===

The library was originally that of the members of the London County Council and reflected their interests. Situated in the same building as the London County Record Office, the library was added to with books on the history and topography of London. The library also included a rich collection of maps, prints, drawings and photographs.

===Middlesex County Record Office===
No single act or resolution marked the beginning of the Middlesex County Record Office. Like most other county record offices it developed naturally from the duty of the Clerk of the Peace to preserve certain records from the Quarter Sessions, together with other records such as enclosure awards and plans of public utilities. The first significant period in the formation of the county record office was in the early 1880s when a special committee was appointed by the justices of the peace to consider and report on the accommodation provided for the storage of the &quot;old records&quot; of the county. On behalf of the committee, John Cordy Jeaffreson, an inspector of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, sorted the records covering 1549–1820 into 87 classes comprising more than 10,000 volumes and nearly 5,000 rolls. The more modern records from post-1820 were given a separate room.

The formation of the London County Council in 1889 had seen the County of Middlesex much reduced in size. In 1893 when the Middlesex sessions papers were to be moved from the sessions house in Clerkenwell (an area that was previously Middlesex but now London) an argument broke out between the two county councils as to who should have responsibility for the material. This protracted dispute lasted some five years, with a high court judge eventually deciding in favour of Middlesex.

Around the same time, a Middlesex County Council act empowered the council to spend money preserving, arranging, indexing, classifying and publishing such records of the county that may be in the public interest. In 1913 the new Middlesex Guildhall at Westminster opened and was equipped with specially constructed muniment rooms, with an assistant to arrange and supervise their transfer from temporary storage. It was not until 1923 that a full-time graduate assistant was placed in charge of dealing with things such as document repair, storage issues, written enquiries, production of documents for public researchers and receipt of any gifts or deposits.

After the Second World War, the work of the county record office expanded steadily, with the appointment of a County Archivist, first in a part-time capacity (Colonel William Le Hardy), then full-time from 1957. By then, the archive had also moved to new premises at 1 Queen Anne&#x27;s Gate Buildings, Dartmouth Street. In 1960 the record office was appointed an official place of deposit for public records by the Lord Chancellor under section 4 (1) of the Public Records Act 1958. After this, the archive increased its holdings, with significant deposits of petty sessions, coroners, Boards of Guardians and other official material. By this time, the record office had acquired an extensive reference library on the topography of Middlesex, as well as a great number of maps, prints and photographs.

===Greater London Record Office ===
Under the Local London Government Act 1963, which came into effect on 1 April 1965, the administrative counties of London and Middlesex together with their respective county councils were abolished. They were replaced by the Greater London Council (GLC) which administered a much wider area known as Greater London. The formation of Greater London also meant that some areas that had been previously part of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire, were also now included. However, to minimise confusion, it was agreed that records from these areas should remain within their ancient county.

The Greater London Council took over responsibility for the established record offices of the counties of London and Middlesex, as well as the former member&#x27;s library of the London County Council. Together, these became the Greater London Record Office (GLRO) and Library. Although administratively united, the new archive continued to exist at two separate sites, with Middlesex material still held at Dartmouth Street and London material at County Hall (the record office being approximately where the London Aquarium is now situated). The two archives finally came together in 1979, when the Dartmouth Street site was sold by the GLC, and both archives were housed at County Hall.

In 1982 the GLRO moved to adapted premises at 40 Northampton Road, Clerkenwell. This site was a former print works, home to the Temple Press. The Press had moved from nearby Rosebery Avenue in August 1939, and continued to use the site until the end of the 1960s.

The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, and since that date the archives have been administered by the City of London Corporation. In 1992 work was completed on a new repository block adjacent to the site in Northampton Road. This extension conformed to archival storage standards, with mobile shelving and environmental controls.

===London Metropolitan Archives ===
The GLRO was renamed London Metropolitan Archives in 1997.

In 2005 the archives of the Corporation of London Records Office were moved to the London Metropolitan Archives to allow for a vast refurbishment programme at Guildhall. The City of London Corporation is the local government authority for the City of London, the area often referred to as the Square Mile and its records office held archives created by the Corporation and the organisations with which it was involved or helped to run. These archives include the earliest material currently held at The London Archives, dating from 1067. The archive contains the official records of how the City was governed and developed, through bodies such as the Court of Aldermen and Court of Common Council and many other official departments like the Chamberlains (which is the main financial department of the City Corporation and also deals with people being given the freedom of the city). It also contains a large number of records of organisations which the City of London Corporation are responsible for such as the City of London Police, a number of courts, open spaces and many of the major London markets.

In 2008 work began on a merger between London Metropolitan Archives and Guildhall Library’s Manuscripts Section and Prints and Maps Section. The Manuscripts Section held deposited records from organisations and institutions within the City of London, including 75 London Livery Companies, schools, parishes, wards (local government units within the City) and of course many large and small businesses which had their home within the Square Mile, from tiny family businesses to major multi-national banking and insurance firms. The Prints and Maps Section of Guildhall Library held collections which complemented the collections already held by London Metropolitan Archives and added much valuable content relating to the City itself. By 2009 the three record offices run by the City of London – London Metropolitan Archives, the Corporation of London Records Office and the Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section – had become one.

=== The London Archives ===
In July 2024, it was announced that the archives would be renamed as &quot;The London Archives&quot; from 5 August.

==Collections==

The records held at The London Archives have been arranged in 28 major classes, of which a number are detailed below. Not all items are available for consultation. Items from uncatalogued collections can be made available only by prior appointment made at least seven days in advance of the intended visit. Some material is restricted or closed under Data Protection legislation because it contains sensitive or personal information relating to living individuals; some records may require written permission from the depositor before they can be viewed; some may be too fragile to be handled.

===Associations===
The London Archives holds records of many associations all with very different purposes. A large number of records are associations with political purposes such as the London Labour Party, London Liberal Party as well as regional branches of the Labour Party and Conservative Party. The records of associations also include a number of trade unions including the National Union of Teachers London and Middlesex branches, the Transport Salaried Staff Association and the Union of Post office Workers. Within the field of education there are records of The National Education Association and the London Head Teachers Association.

Records of pressure groups and campaigning organisations such as the National United Temperance Council and the Royal Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising are also held. One of the larger series of records held are those belonging to the Public Morality Council. Formed in 1899 to combat vice and indecency in London, its members included representatives of all the major religions as well as leaders in education and medicine. The council continued until 1969 concentrating latterly on opposition to sexual immorality and pornography particularly with regards to theatre, cinema, radio and television.

A number of the records relate to groups promoting the arts, sport and recreation. Of particular note are the records of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, though consultation of these archives, are subject to obtaining written permission. Other records include the Artists League of Great Britain, and The Royal Choral Society. On a more sporting theme, there are records of the London Schools Football Association, the National Amateur Rowing Association and the Ramblers Association.
The Associations series includes the archives of the Peabody Trust. The trust has its origins in a donation of £500,000 made by the American philanthropist, George Peabody, for the benefit of the people of London, the city where he had spent most of his adult life. The donation was put into the hands of trustees who were to ensure that it was used to &quot;ameliorate the condition of the poor&quot; of London. It was agreed that cheap, clean housing would best fulfil the intention of the gift, and that the Trust would provide an alternative to the Model Dwellings Companies who operated on a private, less philanthropic basis. The first housing block was opened in Spitalfields in 1864 and consisted of 57 dwellings and nine shops. Further block estates were built in Southwark, Lambeth, Westminster, Chelsea, Islington and Tower Hamlets. The collection includes registers of tenants, photographs, plans and administrative and financial records.

===Businesses===

The London Archives holds many archives from businesses that operated in the London and Middlesex areas. These are arranged alphabetically by the name of the company. One of the major collections in the series is that of the predecessors of London Transport. These include a number of railway companies, particularly the Metropolitan Railway and many of the London Omnibus Companies, as well as the records of the London Passenger Transport Board, which unified services in the London area for the first time and ran from 1933 to 1948.

Another important collection is the archives of Thames Water predecessors. The archive comprises the records of major institutions that supplied water to the metropolis between 1582 and 1974. Up to 1902 the work was largely carried out by private companies operating under increasing public control as time went on. The records of each company have been catalogued separately except in cases where takeover occurred. The companies include London Bridge Waterworks Company and the New River Company. In 1902 all the smaller private institutions were taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board, which assumed supply responsibilities for an area covering . The surviving records include corporate material such as board minutes and legal papers, accounts, staff records, engineering and technical files, plans, photos and property records.

J. Lyons and Co. was founded in 1886 as a catering business for exhibitions in Newcastle upon Tyne, Glasgow, Paris and London. By 1894 it had become a public company and it rapidly established a chain of teashops, corner houses and restaurants. This is one of the most intriguing business collections deposited, for as well as all the usual corporate records such as management, finance and administration, the collection is particularly strong in what may be termed ephemera. There are hundreds of photographs starting from as early 1887, a few films and videos, a large collection of press cuttings, advertisements, menus, lithographs and a Nippy&#x27;s uniform.

Brewers have supplied the metropolis with beer for at least five centuries and by 1700 around 200 common brewers existed. As the industry evolved through acquisitions and competitive means, a hierarchy developed. By 1830 a few large companies dominated, supported by a base of smaller concerns. Several London brewers joined the ranks of England&#x27;s greatest industrial enterprises and The London Archives holds archives of six of those major companies. These include Truman, Hanbury, Buxton &amp; Co Ltd, Courage, Barclay &amp; Simonds Ltd, Watney, Combe, Reid, Ltd, latterly Watney Mann Ltd, and Whitbread &amp; Co Ltd. The surviving records include administrative and financial records, staff records, property records photographs and ephemera.

The collections from Guildhall Library&#x27;s Manuscripts Section have added major financial businesses to the archive&#x27;s holdings, including those of the Baltic Exchange, Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance, RSA Insurance Group, Standard Chartered and Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co.. All the collections previously held at Guildhall Library are now consulted at The London Archives with two exceptions: the archives of Lloyd&#x27;s of London and of the London Stock Exchange continue to be consulted at Guildhall Library, as do the archives of London&#x27;s Livery Companies.

Other business records added to the collection in recent years include Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture Publications, a radical Black publishing house founded by Eric and Jessica Huntley in West London in the 1950s; the Huntleys’ personal archive has also been deposited at The London Archives. The archive of The Africa Centre, an organisation promoting African culture and life was deposited in 2018. 

===Charities===

The London Archives&#x27; holdings of charities records date from the early 17th century and include notable foundations such as Archbishop Tenison&#x27;s Grammar School, the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy and Sutton&#x27;s Hospital (Charterhouse) which was founded by Thomas Sutton in 1611 for the benefit of distressed gentlemen and the education of poor boys. Many of the charities are concerned with housing, education and medicine. One of the major collections is that of the Charity Organisation Society, now known as the Family Welfare Association which was formed to make sure that charitable organisations did not overlap with each other in terms of what they were trying to achieve.

Amongst the many archives of housing associations held, are records of the Hampstead Garden Suburb. The Hampstead Garden Suburb was the vision and accomplishment of Henrietta Barnett who together with her husband Canon Samuel Augustus Barnett set about creating an estate where the working classes could live within pleasant surroundings. The land near Hampstead was purchased via the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust that she had formed. A total of were purchased for £140,000 by 1907. The idea was that the estate would be aesthetically pleasing consisting of low-density housing and thoroughly planned with a mix of buildings and nature. The community would be served by a range of local amenities including churches, libraries, schools, an institute of education and shops. Henrietta wanted to bring different classes together in one area. Unfortunately though the houses may have been more modest, they were still too expensive for many working-class people. Increased building costs and the shortage of local employment meant that the suburb would become largely middle-class. By 1936 building was virtually complete and the suburb was home to some 16,000 people. The collection is particularly valuable to those interested in the history of planned settlements, architecture and the life and work of Henrietta Barnett. The archive consists of records of suburb organisations and recreational societies, education institutions and approximately 10,000 plans and 10,000 photographs.

Among the records of charities are those of the Foundling Hospital, established by royal charter in 1739 by Thomas Coram as a refuge for abandoned children. It was the sole institution responsible for taking in illegitimate children in the London area for a period of well over 120 years. Coram had been appalled by the number of dead and dying babies on the streets of London. Admission to the new hospital was at first limited because of lack of funds. Infants were to be less than two months old and in good health. Once a child had been admitted they were baptised and given a new name and boarded out to a dry or wet nurse in the country. On reaching the age of three, they were returned to the hospital to receive basic schooling before eventually being apprenticed out to trades or service or enlisted in the armed forces. From 1760 the mother was required to submit a written petition detailing her circumstances: these documents provide a valuable resource for social history. Other documents include records of the lives of the children, nursing methods, apothecaries&#x27; prescriptions, and inspectors&#x27; reports. Some parts of the collection have been returned to the Coram family, while more modern files concerned with the Berkhamsted site are at Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies.

===City of London Corporation===

The records that were formerly held by the Corporation of London Record Office and now held at The London Archives have been re-catalogued and are now arranged in two distinct sections.

Records with the prefix COL are the administrative and corporate records of the City of London Corporation. Included in this section are the repertories, journals and letter books from the courts of Aldermen and Common Council, records of those receiving the freedom of the City of London from the Chamberlains department as well as numerous plans from the planning and surveyors departments.

Records with the prefix CLA are deposited collections from organisations and bodies that operate in close association with the City of London Corporation. This series includes records of many of the bridges across the Thames and particularly Tower Bridge, many markets including Smithfield, Billingsgate, Spitalfields and Leadenhall, and a number of courts such as Mansion House and Guildhall Justice Rooms and Southwark coroner&#x27;s court. Records of particular interest in this series are the records of the City of London Sessions, these include criminal trials held before the London jury at the Old Bailey. Another series of particular interest are the records of the City of London Police. Archives include warrant books, over 95% of all personnel files as well as material relating to the Houndsditch murders and letters sent to the force concerning Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders.

===Court records===

The court records held at The London Archives are dominated by one of the finest collection of quarter session records known to exist in the country. The records of the Middlesex and Westminster sessions cover both the judicial and administrative functions of the justices of the peace covering the period 1549–1971. These include sessions of gaol delivery for the Middlesex area, held at the Old Bailey until 1834. Until the 1870s and 1880s, the Middlesex justices were not only responsible for judicial matters in their area, they were also responsible for many of the functions now under the control of local governments. Such roles and responsibilities included county bridges, prisons, lunatic asylums and Feltham Industrial School. The deposited records also include Land and Hearth tax assessments, electoral registers, licensed victuallers, recognizance&#x27;s, building surveyors returns, enclosure awards and maps and plans of numerous public undertakings such as canals, docks and railways.

The London Archives also holds a number of records of the former Inner London police courts. While many of these courts date from the 18th and 19th centuries, the surviving records often only start in the early 20th century. Included in the same section are records of petty sessions, magistrates&#x27; courts and county courts for London and Middlesex. Some magistrates&#x27; courts in the London area are not covered and hold no records of the Crown Courts. Perhaps the most popular series of records in this section are the records of coroner&#x27;s courts. These include the Middlesex area prior to 1889, the London and Middlesex areas from 1889 onwards and the Greater London area after 1965. Unfortunately, the survival rate of coroner&#x27;s records is only about 10 per cent. They are also subject to a closure period of 75 years as opposed to the 30 years on other court records.

===Diocesan records===

The records of the Diocese of London were previously split between London Metropolitan Archives and Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section, but have now been reunited. The records include those of the Consistory Court of London and the Archdeaconry Courts of London and Middlesex as well as administrative and estate records for the diocese as a whole. These records include probate material up to 1858, Tithe maps, Bishops Transcripts and Matrimonial and Testamentary Cause Papers. The archive of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral is now also held at The London Archives.

To the south of the River Thames, The London Archives holds records of the Diocese of Winchester including probate and marriage bonds and allegations from the Archdeaconry Court of Surrey as well as probate from the Commissary Court of Surrey. The London Archives also has records of the Diocese of Southwark along with the archive of Southwark Cathedral and the south-east London part of the Diocese of Rochester.

===Families and individuals===
Estate records held at The London Archivesinclude the Duke of Bedford&#x27;s Covent Garden Estate with many of the records relating to the development of the market. Other major estate records in this series are those of the Marquess of Northampton at Clerkenwell and Canonbury and the Maryon-Wilson estates in Hampstead and Charlton. Notable family collections include those of the Marquess of Anglesey, the Clitherow family of Brentford and the Earl of Jersey, whose papers include correspondence with prominent politicians and literary figures; however the Jersey collection can only be viewed after obtaining written permission. The families and Estates series also includes records of over 80 manors, including those owned by Charterhouse School and St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, which cover land extending from Essex to Wiltshire and Yorkshire. Archives of individuals include Mollie Hunte, an influential educational psychologist; Cy Grant, actor, singer, broadcaster, community organiser and activist, who among many other roles voiced Lieutenant Green in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons; the record office also holds the diary of Robert Hooke, surveyor of the City of London at the time of the Great Fire of 1666 and one of the men appointed to oversee the rebuilding of the City.

===Hospitals and health authorities===

The London Archives holds records for over 100 hospitals and local regional health authorities within the south-east area. The hospital records range from county asylums such as Hanwell Asylum and Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum to major teaching hospitals like Guy&#x27;s Hospital and St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital and Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Hospital, right down to much smaller local hospitals. Anybody wishing to find out what hospital records are held at The London Archives would do well to first consult the hospital records database on the National Archives&#x27; website. The collection of records is not arranged alphabetically as many different hospitals may be covered by one particular management trust, therefore it is worth asking at the reference room desk and they will direct you to the particular binder that you need. It is also worth consulting the three leaflets on hospital records that the archive had produced, namely No. 9 – Sources for the history of nursing, which details the Florence Nightingale collection among the records of St Thomas&#x27; Hospital – No. 13, a general guide to hospital records, and No. 15, which is concerned with patients&#x27; records. All patients&#x27; records among the hospitals collections are subject to data protection laws and may be closed access depending on their date.

===Jewish organisations===
A large number of the Anglo-Jewish community&#x27;s archives have been deposited at The London Archives, including records of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Office of the Chief Rabbi, the Beth Din, the Federation of Synagogues, the United Synagogue and the Spanish and Portuguese Jews Congregation. Other organisations represented include the Jews&#x27; Temporary Shelter and the Jewish Free School. The majority of these records are concerned with management and policy decisions, and many require written permission from the depositor before access can be granted.

===London local authorities===

Two very important series of records have been classified under the heading London Local Authorities. The first of these, are the records of the boards of guardians of the poor law union for London and Middlesex. Poor law unions were formed as a result of the new Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, when neighbouring parishes joined together to pool their resources, each of these unions would be administered by a board of guardians. The records consist primarily of general minutes of the board, administrative records including details of staff, settlement examinations, orders of removal, workhouse and records and school records. The records are arranged by each individual board although the amount of surviving material varies from board to board. The majority of material is from the period 1850 to 1930.

The other major collection in this series are the records of the Middlesex Deeds Registry. By the Middlesex Registry Act 1708 a registry was established for the registration of all deeds, conveyances, wills, encumbrances etc., affecting freehold land and leased land for periods of 21 years or more, within the ancient county of Middlesex. In 1862 the national land register was introduced on a voluntary basis. In 1899 it became compulsory for land in the new area of North London that was formally Middlesex to be registered nationally. This dramatically reduced the amount of entries to the Middlesex Deeds Register, though it continued to serve the outer part of Middlesex until 1938 when all land within Middlesex had to be registered through the national land register. Deeds and documents brought to the registry were copied onto pieces of parchment called memorials and then bound into large volumes or registers. The documents are not complete copies of the originals and certain information such as covenants and other restrictions may be missing. Information entered includes date of the transaction, names of the parties and a description of the property. From the mid-19th century this also often included a plan of the property.

===London-wide elected bodies===
As well as the archives of the London County Council, Middlesex County Council, Greater London Council, Inner London Education Authority and the London Residuary Body, The London Archives also hold records of their 19th- and 20th-century predecessors such as the Metropolitan Board of Works, Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, London School Board and the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The records of these bodies are as broad as the functions of modern local government, with documentation on education, housing, health services, welfare, transport, building regulations, drainage, culture and leisure. Many of the different bodies include a series of indexed committee minutes, which often prove to be a valuable starting point when attempting to access the records.

===Maps===

The London Archives has an extensive collection of maps numbering over 15,000. Many of the maps are split up amongst the various different collections for example tithes maps found amongst the diocesan records and enclosure maps found amongst court records. Fortunately there is a single card catalogue that combines all of the maps from the various collections and has listed them by the area they cover. Twenty of the most popular maps held by The London Archives are accessible in the map cabinet in the reference room. These include the first edition of the Ordnance Survey for London 1867–70 and the Second World War bomb damage maps. The collection was increased, especially for the City of London, by the addition of the holdings of the Guildhall Library Prints and Maps Section.

===National records===

Included in this series are records of the British Waterways Board particularly concerning the River Lea, plans of National Schools in Middlesex and the London Region of English Heritage that took over many of the files and plans of the former Greater London Council Historic Buildings Division. Also featuring in the series of National Records are the archives of Wandsworth (HM Prison) and Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison). Of the two prisons the Wandsworth records are much more extensive, including administrative and staff records, photographs and prisoners records from 1879. For Wormwood Scrubs the majority of records concern prisoners and begin in 1917.

===Non-established religions===
The majority of nonconformist records at The London Archives relate to the Congregationalist, Baptist, United Reformed and Methodist churches, circuits and missions dating predominantly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Some records of a few German churches are held, and some recent marriage registers from a Salvation Army citadel, a Seventh-Day Adventist church, the Kingdom Hall, Wandsworth and a Sikh Gurdwara. As well as baptism, marriage and burial records from individual nonconformist churches, records of several nonconformist organisations such as the London Congregational Union and the New Bunhill Fields Burial Ground are held. The London Archives holds no Roman Catholic records, which are usually retained by the individual church.

===Parishes===

The London Archives holds records of more than 900 Anglican churches in the London and Middlesex areas, including over 100 City of London parishes. The types of records held vary from parish to parish, with some parishes only depositing registers of baptisms, marriage and burials. Other parishes, however, have deposited a great deal more and the types of records include vestry minutes, churchwarden accounts, parish poor rate and early workhouse material, parish magazines, plans, photographs and other ephemera.

For those interested in parish records, researchers should be aware that for certain areas of London, The London Archives will not be the likely place records would be deposited. For example churches within the ancient City of Westminster will deposit their records at the City of Westminster Archives. This will include parishes such as Saint Martin in the Fields, Saint James Piccadilly, Saint Clement Danes and Saint George Hanover Square. Other areas that would not deposit their records at The London Archives are the modern London Boroughs that prior to the formation of the Greater London Council in 1964 would have been part of the former counties of Essex, Kent and Surrey. For each of these areas researchers should consult either their local borough archive or the respective ancient county record office.

===Photograph collection===

The London Archives&#x27; photograph collection contains almost half a million photographs covering the history and topography of London, especially the inner London area. The majority of photos were taken for official purposes by and for the London County Council and Greater London Council. The collection is arranged in two sections. The first section is arranged by alphabetically by subject covering everything from Abbeys to Zoological Gardens. Particularly well covered are subjects such as schools, housing estates, parks, bridges, churches, cinemas, theatres, hospitals, pubs and areas of war damage. The second section is arranged alphabetically by modern London borough and then alphabetically by address.

===Prints and drawings===

The prints and drawings collection is similarly arranged to the photograph collection, with a greater focus on the inner London areas. It is also arranged both topographically and by subject. Most of the prints and drawings date from the 18th and 19th centuries. The prints collection has been made considerably richer by the addition of the print collection from Guildhall Library, which includes prints relating to the City of London.

===Film and video===
The London Archives holds many films produced by bodies including London Transport, the Greater London Council and the Corporation of London. Some of these films are accessible on YouTube. In 2019 London Metropolitan Archives took in an extraordinary collection of filmed oral history interviews created by the National HIV Story Trust (formerly The AIDS Since the 80s Project); the interviews contain first-hand testimonies of people living with HIV, and form the basis of educational resources, talks, films and publications in order to improve knowledge and understanding of HIV.

==Library==
The London Archives&#x27; library started as the library of the former members of the London County Council. It contains over 100,000 volumes and specialises in all aspects of London life, the growth and development of the area, its history and organisation of Local Government. The library is purely a reference library and its holdings can be searched via Guildhall Library&#x27;s online catalogue. 

==Finding aids and resources==
A search of The London Archives&#x27; holdings can be done online by accessing its website and navigating to its online catalogue.

The London Picture Archive is a website holding visual images from The London Archives&#x27; photograph, print and other collections. Images can be licensed or purchased for home use through the site.

A programme of digitisation of major genealogical sources, including Anglican and non-conformist registers, school registers, electoral registers, Boards of Guardians records, City of London freedom records, wills, Land Tax records and records of transportation has been running for some years now, in partnership with Ancestry.com. The resulting digital records are available by subscription through Ancestry&#x27;s website, which can also be searched free of charge via computer terminals in The London Archives&#x27; search room.

<text>James Kelly (16 October 1929 – 16 July 2003) was a former Irish Army intelligence officer who was found not guilty (along with two former Irish government ministers) of attempting to illegally import arms for the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the Arms Trial of 1970.

==Early life==
James Kelly was the eldest of ten children, born in 1929 into a staunchly Irish republican family from Bailieboro, County Cavan. His father, also named James Kelly, had stood for Sinn Féin in local Elections in 1918, topping the poll. An ancestor from the late 18th century, Robert Kelly, was a member of the United Irishmen, and was supposedly an Officer Commanding, or General, of the United Irishmen in the East Cavan/South Monaghan area. James Kelly joined the Irish Army in 1949. By 1960 he had been promoted to captain and appointed to the intelligence section at army headquarters.

==Arms Trial==
Kelly was a central figure in the Arms Trial, having travelled to Hamburg to arrange the purchase of arms. It emerged later that Neil Blaney had ordered him to do so, but before the weapons arrived the Garda Special Branch had heard of the plan and informed the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, aborting the importation and resulting in criminal charges for the plotters. Although in his summing-up the judge said it was no defence for Kelly to say that he believed that the government had authorised the importation of arms, Kelly was acquitted.

Although he was acquitted, Kelly suffered financially because he had felt compelled to resign from the Army even before the prosecution was brought. He printed and published a personal memoir in paperback format called &quot;Orders for the Captain?&quot; in 1971.

Kelly never denied that he had been involved in extra-legal arms purchase talks, but contended that he had been ordered to do so by some ministers. A typical version of the events is found in a 1993 hostile biography of Charles Haughey, claiming: &quot;As early as October 1969, to the certain knowledge of Charles Haughey, James Gibbons, the Department of Justice, the Special Branch and Army Intelligence, there were meetings with leading members of the IRA, when they were promised money and arms. The critical encounter took place in Bailieborough [sic], County Cavan, on Saturday, 4 October 1969. It had been arranged by Captain James Kelly, an army intelligence officer, and Cathal Goulding. Kelly, at that stage, was already the subject of several security reports to the Secretary of the Department of Justice, Peter Berry, from the Special Branch, implicating Kelly with subversives and with promises of money and of arms.&quot; Kelly never objected to such versions of the events of 1969.

==Political life==
Following the Arms Trial, Kelly joint-founded Aontacht Éireann, a political party directly born out of the scandal. He was elected vice-chairman of the party and stood in Dáil elections for them unsuccessfully on two occasions in 1973 and 1977 in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. Aontacht Éireann met with little success at the polls and by 1980 he had joined Fianna Fáil, becoming a member of its national executive. Following the first applications of the 1987 Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, he resigned from the party in 1989 in opposition to the extradition of Provisional IRA prisoners to the United Kingdom. He also served twice as President of the 1916-1921 Club.

Kelly was heavily involved in the Peace Process. In 1989 he published his own draft on how a Peace Process could proceed. His document called The Courage of the Brave was launched in Conway Mill, Belfast on 24 August 1989. Present on the platform party at the launch of the document were, Fianna Fáil Councillor Macarten McCormack, Mr Ernest Cowan, Chairman of Kentstown Fianna Fáil who had served with Captain Kelly on the Fianna Fáil National Executive, Robert C Linnon, National President, Irish American Unity Conference, Kate Lavery, representing John J Finucane, National President, American Irish Political Education Committee and Father Des Wilson of Belfast.

He launched a successful defamation case against Garret FitzGerald over an article in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. He died in 2003 and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. The epitaph on his grave is &quot;Put not your trust in princes&quot;, &quot;...that was a quote from Machiavelli&quot; Suzanne Kelly (Capt. James Kellys daughter) stated in TV3s The Rise and Fall of Fianna Fáil in 2011

<text>Privas (; , ) is a city located in France, in the department of Ardèche.

With its 8,465 inhabitants (2019), it is the least populated prefecture (capital of a department).

It was the location of the 1629 Siege of Privas. Today, Privas is known for the purée made from the local chestnuts, and for its sweetened marron glacé.

==History==
The earliest traces of the commune are attested in the hamlet of Lac where recent archaeological excavations have revealed a Roman villa dating to the beginning of the Empire, as well as a medieval burying-ground. Moulds for counterfeiting coinage found in the 19th century on the slopes of Mont-Toulon have not been interpretable as signifying a local centre of population.

Privas possibly comes from the old Gallic word &quot;briva&quot; meaning thoroughfare, or more specifically a wooden causeway over a ravine or water. This may refer to a river crossing now spanned by the &quot;Pont Louis XIII&quot;, just to the south of the town centre. Privas inhabitants are called &quot;Privadois&quot;.

The earliest &quot;bourg&quot; of Privas developed around the church of Saint-Thomas (place de la République), a dependency of the Cluniac priory of Rompon. The château (&quot;castri&quot;) of Privas on the site of the present &quot;collège-couvent des Récollets&quot; is not attested prior to the 13th century, when the town was walled. Laid waste in 1621 and again following the siege of 1629, nothing of it remains.

In the twelfth century Privas belonged to the seigneurie of the Poitiers-Valentinois, comtes de Valence, whose liege lords were the counts of Toulouse. Aymar de Poitiers, in 1281, and his son in 1309, granted charters to the town, guaranteeing its traditional liberties, and its fiscal, economic and military rights.

In the 13th century the town expanded from two originals centres, Bize and Clastre, to develop on the level towards the east, in two new quarters, Claux and Mazel.

In the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation took swift and deep roots in Privas, among common people, the high bourgeoisie and the nobles alike. Fierce repression was organized: many Protestant inhabitants were killed, and others fled to Geneva. Nevertheless, the reform movement spread, and for nearly seventy years no Catholic mass was said at Privas, where the church itself was demolished in 1570 and the French garrison refused entry. There were no Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacres at Privas.

Though the king&#x27;s mistress Diane de Poitiers was made baronne of Chalencon and of Privas, and in 1566 the barony was divided between her two daughters, the elder retaining the honour of Privas, in the French Wars of Religion Privas remained a major centre of Huguenots, called the &quot;Rampart of Reform&quot;, and the &quot;Geneva of the country&quot;, a symbol of resistance to the Catholic monarchy. The seigneurie was sold to Jacques de Chambaud, a head of the Protestants, who became the first Huguenot seigneur of Privas.

In the Huguenot rebellions of 1621–29, Privas was besieged in 1629 by royal forces, with Louis XIII in attendance. Defended by Montbrun with 800 men, the city was taken and destroyed.

During the siege of 1629, the town of Privas was well defended by walls and ditches. Privas also has gorges to its south, east and north that provide a natural defence. Given this topography, the Huguenots in the town did not believe that a strong attack from the east was possible. Nevertheless, on 22 May, the Swiss mercenaries of the attacking Royalist Catholic army of Cardinal Richelieu managed to haul by hand six huge pieces of artillery, each weighing about four tons, from Tauléac across the Ouvèze river and up the zig-zag path onto the plateau of Le Vanel, to the east of the town walls. From this decisive vantage point they bombarded the town until its surviving defenders were forced to evacuate and take their last stand on Mont Toulon on its west. During the siege, five hundred Royalist attackers and one thousand Protestant defenders were killed. Surviving defenders were executed, imprisoned, or deported to be galley slaves. By fire or cannon, the majority of the buildings in the town were destroyed. Privas was a ghost town for many years after. It is estimated that as a result of the defeat of the Huguenots in the region, one-fifth of the Protestant population of the Ardèche emigrated. After the defeat of the Camisard revolt (1702–1715) a further 50,000 Archèche Protestants left France. Many fled to England or Switzerland.

During the French Revolution in the 1790s a guillotine was erected in the Place de la République. A number of clerics were executed. With the administrative reordering of the French Revolution, Privas, in alternation with Annonay, Aubenas, Bourg-Saint-Andéol and Tournon-sur-Rhône, became an administrative centre of Ardèche. After a brief interval as &quot;chef-lieu&quot; of its district, it was attached to the district of Coiron.

Before about 1870 only a minority of people in the area spoke (or even referred to themselves as) French. They spoke a Provençal-Occitan patois, similar to Catalan. &#x27;Les français&#x27; were the incomers or the educated middle-class, who spoke French as their main language. There was also a cultural divide between the people of the Ardèche plateau (known as &quot;Padgels&quot;) and the valley inhabitants (known as a &quot;Royols&quot;).

==Economy==

In the nineteenth century the town hosted a number of water-powered silk mills. Iron-ore mining was also a major activity, in the Ouvèze valley to the west of Privas. But mining had declined to the point of extinction by the First World War and the silk industry was mostly extinct by the Second. The town used to be linked to the main railway system by a branch line railway, and there were tramways to both Aubenas and Le Pouzin. These rail communications no longer exist. Privas&#x27;s most famous products today are sugared chestnuts. A little wine is also produced in the area.

As a town and a préfecture, many people are employed as administrators. But local employment in the préfecture has been declining since the 1990s because of the amalgamation of many services within the Ardèche and Drôme départements. Tourism is a more vibrant sector for employment.

==Tourism==

Privas has hotel accommodation, gîtes and camping sites. There are many local walks and other recreational activities. It is also a noted area for fossils. Situated with easy access to both the Rhône Valley and the Ardèche Gorges, tourist activity is increasing in the district.

<text>Bharatiya Jan Congress (Indian Popular Congress) was a political party that existed in the Indian state of Bihar around 1999-2001. BJC was led by the ex-Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra.

Mishra, who then belonged to the Indian National Congress, was the Chief Minister of Bihar 1975-1979, 1980-1983 and 1989-1990. Mishra was an opponent of the leadership of Sitaram Kesri in the Congress party.

Mishra was accused of corruption in connection with the so-called &#x27;fodder scandal&#x27;. During one period he has imprisoned for his role in the affair.

In 1999 BJC was active in forming a political front in Bihar consisting of BJC, Bihar Vikas Party, Janata Dal (Secular), All India Forward Bloc, Samajwadi Janata Party and Nationalist Congress Party. The front was supposed to confront both the National Democratic Alliance and Rashtriya Janata Dal.

The BJC youth wing was called Bharatiya Yuva Jan Congress (Indian Youth Popular Congress) and the student wing Bharatiya Chhatra Jan Congress (Indian Student Popular Congress).

In 2001 BJC merged with Nationalist Congress Party. Mishra did however leave NCP ahead of the 2004 elections and joined Janata Dal (United). Later Mishra joined RJD.

<doc id="1190859" wikidata="Q5214645" url="?curid=1190859" title="Dana, Massachusetts">
<text>Dana was a town located in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. Dana was lost as a result of the formation of the Quabbin Reservoir.

==History==
Formed from parts of Petersham, Greenwich, and Hardwick, it was incorporated in 1801. The town was named for Massachusetts statesman Francis Dana. The town was disincorporated on April 28, 1938, as part of the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir. Upon disincorporation, all of the town was ceded to the adjacent town of Petersham. The majority of the land of the former town is still above water.

As with the nearby town of Prescott, after the disincorporation, houses were moved or razed, but cellar holes remained. The public is only allowed to visit the former town of Dana by foot, as the old narrow road is blocked off to cars. In the town center (which is still somewhat maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation), a stone marker has been installed, which reads: &quot;SITE OF DANA COMMON 1801-1938 To all those who sacrificed their homes and way of life (Erected by Dana Reunion, 1996)&quot;. The common and a area encompassing the former town center has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="1190868" wikidata="Q203529" url="?curid=1190868" title="Lons-le-Saunier">
<text>Lons-le-Saunier () is a commune and capital of the Jura Department, eastern France.

==Geography==
The town is in the heart of the Revermont region, at the foot of the first plateau of the Jura massif. The Jura escarpment extends to the east and south, while to the west lies the plain of Bresse and to the north extensive vineyards.

The river Vallière runs through the town, rising in a typical Jura blind valley not far away, at Revigny. It has been conduited since the 1960s on grounds of hygiene, since sewage outlets run into it. A small section remains in the open air near the parc des Bains, and only a single bridge (the pont de la Guiche) remains.

The town is approximately equally placed between Besançon, Dijon, Bourg-en-Bresse and Geneva, though the last of these lies on the other side of the Jura massif. It is served by the A39 autoroute, by which Dijon can be reached in about an hour and Lyon in an hour and a half. The town&#x27;s railway station lies on the line from Strasbourg to Lyon.

The wine-growing region to the north of the town is particularly well known, and includes the vintages of l&#x27;Etoile, Château-Chalon and Arbois.

The Jura escarpment to the south and east is a popular tourist region, with its attractions including the lakes of Chalain, Clairvaux and Vouglans (at Lect, Jura), and mountain resorts such as Prénovel and Les Rousses.

In terms of area, Lons-le-Saunier is the second smallest prefectural town in France, after Bobigny.

==History==

The brine springs of Lons-le-Saunier have been exploited since the Neolithic. In the 19th century thermal baths were established, of which the monumental Thermes Lédonia have been preserved.

<text>James Park Woods (4 January 1886 – 18 January 1963) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War I; the Victoria Cross was the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to members of the Australian armed forces at the time. Woods enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in September 1916 and, after training in Australia and the United Kingdom, joined his unit, the 48th Battalion, in France in September 1917. Along with the rest of his battalion, he participated in the First Battle of Passchendaele the following month. In early 1918, Woods was hospitalised for several months before rejoining his unit in May. He again reported sick in July, and did not return to the 48th Battalion until mid-August.

On 18 September 1918, the 48th Battalion was involved in the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line during the Hundred Days Offensive. After the first phase of the attack, some elements of Woods&#x27; unit were tasked to support another battalion as it conducted a further assault. When it was suspected that flanking British troops had not gone forward to their objective as reported, a four-man patrol including Woods attempted to make contact with them. Instead of finding British troops, they encountered a strong German post and, after calling for reinforcements, attacked it, driving more than thirty Germans from the position. Woods&#x27; actions during this assault and subsequent defence of the captured post resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross. Woods survived the war, returned to Australia and operated a vineyard and orchard in Western Australia. He retired early due to ill health and died in 1963. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.

==Early life==
James Park &quot;Jimmy&quot; Woods was born at Two Wells, South Australia, on 4 January 1886, the son of a blacksmith, James Woods, and his wife Ester Johnson. After his mother&#x27;s death when he was seven, Woods was raised by a stepsister and, after completing his schooling, worked in a vineyard alongside his brothers. Not long after World War I broke out in 1914, he attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but was rejected due to his height of . He and his brother Will then moved to Western Australia and for the next two years worked in cartage and fencing in the Kantanning district before James became a viticulturist at Caversham in the Swan Valley wine region near Perth. He was also an enthusiastic cricketer in his younger years. After further unsuccessful attempts to join the AIF, he was eventually successful on 29 September 1916, after height requirements had been lowered.

==World War I==
===1916–1917===
Following his enlistment as a private, Woods was allotted as a reinforcement to the 48th Battalion, a mixed South Australian-Western Australian unit, part of the 12th Brigade, 4th Division. It was already serving on the Western Front in France and Belgium. After two months training at Blackboy Hill, Woods embarked with the rest of his reinforcement draft on at Fremantle on 23 December 1916. He disembarked at Devonport in the UK on 16 February 1917, and joined the 12th Training Battalion at Codford on Salisbury Plain. During this training period, he was hospitalised with mumps and then with bronchitis and pneumonia. Recovered, he completed his training, embarked at Southampton for France, and joined the 48th Battalion on 12 September.

At the time Woods joined the battalion, it was undergoing training and absorbing reinforcements in a rest area at Zuytpeene. On 21 September, the battalion was collected by buses and transported over several days via Steenvoorde to the vicinity of Ypres in Belgium. There the 12th Brigade relieved other units of the 4th Division that had participated in the Battle of Polygon Wood and took up support positions. During this period its main tasks were battlefield salvage and digging graves for recently killed Germans and Australians. Despite these non-combat tasks, the battalion suffered several casualties from German artillery fire. The 48th Battalion was relieved from these positions on 1 October, and occupied trenches at Westhoek Ridge overnight before returning to Steenvoorde.

After a week at Steenvoorde, Woods&#x27; battalion marched to Abeele on 10 October, then entrained for Ypres. That evening it marched to trenches on Westhoek Ridge, where it received orders for a major attack by the division: the First Battle of Passchendaele, which was fought on 12 October. Despite initial success and the capture of more than 200 Germans, the main attack failed, leaving the left flank of the battalion exposed. The first German counterattack was beaten off, but with its left flank unprotected, the 48th Battalion was pushed back to its start line by a second counterattack. During the fighting, the unit suffered 370 casualties from its original complement of 621. Woods and the rest of the battalion were withdrawn from the line and they were re-united with the nucleus troops, the one-third of each unit that was retained out of the line when a battalion went into action. Thus reinforced, the battalion then went briefly into a support position on Anzac Ridge on 19 October, before being relieved and marching away from Passchendaele for a long period of rest and recuperation. This time was spent first at Cuhem, then Friancourt before the battalion spent a few weeks at a camp near Péronne, where Woods and the rest of the unit celebrated Christmas Day.

===1918===
On 8 January 1918, the 48th Battalion marched to Péronne and, travelling by train and on foot, arrived in Belgium where they entered the front line trenches near Hollebeke on 11 January. The battalion remained in the quiet trenches in cold winter conditions for ten days before being relieved, being mainly engaged on improving the dilapidated defences. On the day after the battalion was relieved and went into the rear area, Woods reported sick. He was diagnosed with either bronchitis or pericarditis, and was evacuated to a hospital in Birmingham, UK. He did not return to his battalion until 30 May, when the battalion was in a rest area at Rivery. On 2 June the unit moved forward again, taking up positions as part of the divisional reserve. Two weeks later, the 48th Battalion moved into the front line near Sailly-le-Sec, from which it was relieved on 4 July. It then went back into a rest area near Allonville with the remainder of the 4th Division. This rest period continued to the end of the month, but on 23 July, Woods reported sick with dysentery. He was evacuated and admitted to a casualty clearing station to recover, and did not return to his unit until 16 August. At this time, the battalion was in the front line near Lihons, where it had a quiet time until relieved on 24 August. The unit was then withdrawn to a rest area near Saint-Vaast-en-Chaussée where it remained for nearly two weeks.

By September 1918, the Allies were in the midst of the Hundred Days Offensive, a series of unanswered attacks that had commenced with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August. As part of the attack on the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18 September, the 48th Battalion led the assault in the first phase, capturing 480 Germans, and they were followed by the 45th and 46th Battalions which were responsible for the second and third phases respectively. The Australian attack was near Le Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin. On the right flank of the 12th Brigade, the British 1st Division delayed its assault on the third objective line. The commander of the 12th Brigade, Brigadier General Raymond Leane, therefore ordered two companies of the 48th Battalion to protect the flank of the 46th Battalion as it conducted the third phase of the attack. After the 46th Battalion&#x27;s successful assault, the two companies of the 48th Battalion were tasked to assist the 46th Battalion in consolidating their position. The British 1st Division on the right flank repeatedly reported that they had also captured the third objective, and Leane sent patrols to confirm.

Woods was a member of a four-man patrol sent on Leane&#x27;s orders to make contact with the British. Instead of finding British troops, they located a strongly defended German position with excellent fields of fire. While an attack in force on the position was being organised, Woods led the patrol against the German defenders. Woods killed one German, and at least thirty others fled, leaving behind four heavy and two light machine guns. One of the patrol was wounded in the assault, but they managed to hold off several determined counterattacks until reinforcements arrived. Woods climbed onto the parapet, lay down, and threw hand grenades passed to him, causing severe casualties to the Germans. Reinforcements arrived when he was down to his last few rifle cartridges, and the post was secured by dawn. During the overall brigade attack, the 48th Battalion suffered just 65 casualties. For his work, Woods was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC).

The 4th Division was then relieved and went to the rear to rest, and the brigade did not return to combat before the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Woods&#x27; VC citation was published on Christmas Eve 1918, and read:

Woods&#x27; VC was the only one awarded to a member of the 48th Battalion. He received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 31 May 1919. Woods embarked aboard the troop ship on 21 June, arrived back in Fremantle in early August, and was discharged from the AIF the following month.

==Later life==

On his return to civilian life, Woods bought and operated a vineyard and orchard in the Swan Valley. He married Olive Adeline Wilson at the Caversham Methodist Church on 30 April 1921. The couple had seven children: four sons and three daughters. James suffered from poor health as a result of his gassing and chest infections during his service, and in 1937 retired on a full pension, expected to only live a few more years. The family moved to Claremont. His sons Gordon and Norman served in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II; Gordon, the eldest, was killed in a flying training accident near Newcastle, New South Wales, in October 1943. In retirement, Woods was involved with the Returned Sailors&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Airmen&#x27;s Imperial League of Australia, serving as president of the Caversham sub-branch, and was a keen fisherman. In 1956, he went to the UK to attend the VC centenary.

Woods died on 18 January 1963 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, in Nedlands, aged 77, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and six children. A ward at the Repatriation General Hospital, now known as the Hollywood Private Hospital, is named in his honour.

As well as the Victoria Cross, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Woods was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour. The Victoria Cross is the pre-eminent award for gallantry in the armed services and since 1991 the Victoria Cross for Australia has been awarded in the Australian honours system.

<text>Guéret (; Occitan: &quot;Garait&quot;) is a commune and the prefecture of the Creuse department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in central France.

==Geography==
Guéret is a light industrial town, the largest in the department, with a big woodland and some farming not far from the town centre. It is approximately by road northeast of Limoges at the junction of the D942, D940 and the N145 roads.
==History==
Guéret grew up round an abbey founded in the 7th century. In later times it became the capital of the County of La Marche.

==Population==
==Sights==
*The church of St. Pierre and St. Paul, dating from the thirteenth century.
*The Hotel de Moneyroux (incorrectly called &quot;Castle of the Counts of Marche&quot;, as no count ever lived in Guéret). This building, of Gothic style, was constructed in the fifteenth century by Antoine Allard (1839-1896). It is now the headquarters of the General Council of the Creuse. It can be visited during public holidays.
*The Presidial, dating from the seventeenth century. This building houses the town hall.
*The Museum of the Sénatorerie. Partly built in eighteenth century, the building served as the residence of senators under Napoleon. Since 1832, the Society of Archaeological and Natural Sciences of the Creuse, one of the oldest learned societies of France has been housed here. It brings together natural history collections and works of art. In 1907, the Hotel de la Sénatorerie museum was surrounded by a park and trees.
*The war memorial.
*The seventeenth-century chateau of Sainte Feyrer, built on the foundations of a castle from the Middle Ages, of which there are some remains. The building of the eighteenth century was constructed by the architect Brousseau. It has an elegant staircase and the oratory is classified as a historical monument.
* A vast permanent labyrinth is located south of Guéret.
*Courtille lake, a recreation area south of Guéret, is an artificial lake along a shaded path. With a circumference of about 3 km, it is used for sports and leisure (running, sailing, walking) or picnicking on the grass.
*Chabrières forest is large and stretches south of Guéret. It includes: A zoo, where one can see wolves in semi-liberty in large enclosures. Opened in 2001, it is a noted site in the field of protection of this species. There are some huge natural monoliths, such as &quot;la Pierre Grole&quot; linked to local myths and legends and some old granite quarries, once used mainly for cobblestones of the streets of Paris.
== Climate ==
Guéret has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) influenced by its elevation and proximity to the Bay of Biscay&#x27;s maritime inflow of Gulf Stream air. As a result, the climate is mild for its latitude, wet and also relatively gloomy.

== Personalities ==

* Antoine Varillas, a historian, was born here in 1624.
* Marcel Jouhandeau (1888–1979), writer, was born here.
* Madeleine Chapelle (1782–1849), the wife and model of painter Dominique Ingres.
* Georges Pludermacher (born 1944), classical pianist
* Pierre Michon (born 1945), writer, spent his childhood here.
* Pierre Petit (born 1957), racing driver

==International relations==
Guéret is twinned with:
 Stein, Bavaria, Germany since 1991 and Puck, Poland

<text>Geoffrey Harold Woolley, (14 May 1892 – 10 December 1968) was a British Army infantry officer, Church of England priest, and Second World War military chaplain. He was the first British Territorial Army officer to be awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Woolley was the son of a clergyman, Rev. George Herbert Woolley, the curate of St Matthew’s, Upper Clapton, in London, and his wife Sarah. He had seven sisters and three brothers, including the famous archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley and George Cathcart Woolley, a colonial administrator and ethnographer. Woolley was educated at Parmiter&#x27;s School, Bethnal Green, St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead and The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.
He seemed destined to follow his father into the Church until the outbreak of the First World War, when he obtained a commission in the Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles, the 9th (County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment of the British Army.

==First World War==
The Queen Victoria&#x27;s Rifles were posted to the Ypres Salient. On 17 April 1915, the British Army captured Hill 60, a low rise to the south-east of Ypres. In the midst of fierce German efforts to retake the hill, Second Lieutenant Woolley&#x27;s company were sent up on the afternoon of 20 April to take ammunition supplies to the defenders.
The situation quickly deteriorated, with many men and all the other officers on the hill being killed. Woolley refused verbal and written orders to withdraw, saying he and his company would remain until properly relieved. They repelled numerous attacks through the night. When they were relieved the next morning, he returned with 14 men remaining from the 150-strong company. The citation for the Victoria Cross he was awarded for this action reads:
Two days later Woolley was promoted directly to the rank of Captain.
He saw further action in the early stages of the Second Battle of Ypres until he was invalided back to England suffering from poison gas and psychological effects.
When Woolley had recovered, he was appointed as an instructor at the Officers Infantry School. He returned to the Western Front in summer 1916 as a General Staff Officer Grade II on the Third Army Staff. After the war, Woolley was one of many officers awarded the Military Cross in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1919.

==Later life==

After the war Woolley resumed the study of theology at Oxford, was ordained in December 1920, and took a teaching post at Rugby School. In 1923 he resigned his commission and became vicar of Monk Sherborne, Hampshire, before moving on to the chaplaincy of Harrow School.

In January 1940 Woolley resigned from the school and was commissioned into the Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Department.
He was appointed Senior Chaplain of the Algiers area in November 1942, reaching the rank of Chaplain to the Forces 3rd Class (Major). With several other officers he was appointed OBE in 1943 &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North Africa.&quot;
His son Harold, a Spitfire pilot, was posted to North Africa in the same month, and killed in early December 1942 in a battle over Tunis.

Woolley took on the parish of St Mary&#x27;s, Harrow on the Hill, in 1944. In 1952, finding it difficult to climb the hill, he resigned his commission and moved to be rector of West Grinstead, Sussex, where he stayed until he retired in 1958.

<text>Bank reserves are a commercial bank&#x27;s cash holdings physically held by the bank, and deposits held in the bank&#x27;s account with the central bank. Under the fractional-reserve banking system used in most countries, central banks may set minimum reserve requirements that mandate commercial banks under their purview to hold cash or deposits at the central bank equivalent to at least a prescribed percentage of their liabilities, such as customer deposits. Such sums are usually termed required reserves, and any funds above the required amount are called excess reserves. These reserves are prescribed to ensure that, in the normal events, there is sufficient liquidity in the banking system to provide funds to bank customers wishing to withdraw cash. Even when there are no reserve requirements, banks often as a matter of prudent management hold reserves in case of unexpected events, such as unusually large net withdrawals by customers (such as before Christmas) or bank runs. Traditionally, central banks do not pay interest on reserve balances, but such schemes have become increasingly common in the 21st century. Funds in banks that are not retained as a reserve are available to be lent, at interest.

In bookkeeping, reserves are ordinarily part of the equity of a company. Bank reserves, on the other hand, are part of the bank&#x27;s assets. In a bank&#x27;s annual report, bank reserves are referred to as &quot;cash and balances at central banks&quot;.

== Terms ==
*Reserves on deposit (of a commercial bank): the deposit accounts for the commercial bank at the central bank.
*Vault cash (of a commercial bank): paper currency and current coins owned by the commercial bank and (generally) held in the bank vaults of the commercial bank.
*Borrowed reserves: bank reserves that were obtained by borrowing from the central bank.
*Non-borrowed reserves: bank reserves that were not obtained by borrowing from the central bank.
*Required reserves: the amount of reserves (reserves on deposit plus vault cash) that commercial banks are required to hold, as determined by the central bank as a function of the commercial bank&#x27;s deposit liabilities.
*Excess reserves: bank reserves in excess of the reserve requirement. A portion of excess reserves (or even all of them) may be desired reserves.
*Free reserves: the amount by which excess reserves exceed borrowed reserves.
*Total reserves: all bank reserves, i.e. cash in the vault, plus reserves on deposit at the central bank, also borrowed plus non-borrowed, also required plus excess.

==Cash held by banks==

Banking regulators typically determine the banks&#x27; reserve requirements, including the minimum proportion of a bank&#x27;s assets that banks must hold in cash. Subject to such directives, banks tend to keep their cash reserves as low as is prudently necessary, as banks do not earn interest on it, and it is a cost to keep secure. In the United States such reserves are often called vault money.

The amount of money needed to be at call varies because of a number of factors. For example, there is a higher demand at Christmas time when commercial activity is highest. Also, when workers were paid in cash, there was a higher demand on payday. There may also be sudden, unexpected surges in demand for cash by individuals during economic panics, which may result in a &quot;run on the bank&quot; as individuals seek to withdraw money from bank accounts.

When banks find that their cash holdings are below the anticipated cash requirements, especially if they are below the prescribed minimum, they would either borrow cash from other banks that have surplus holdings (e.g., via the interbank market) or from the monetary authority (e.g., via the &quot;discount window&quot;). When banks no longer believe they need as much cash on hand they would return the cash to the monetary authority, or offer the surplus to other banks.

==Bank deposits at central bank==
Commercial banks are usually required to keep funds in the bank&#x27;s account with the central bank. Such funds are usually counted as part of the banks&#x27; reserves. Some central banks pay interest on these deposits while others do not.

<doc id="1190887" wikidata="Q48179" url="?curid=1190887" title="Pilot wave theory">
<text>In theoretical physics, the pilot wave theory, also known as Bohmian mechanics, was the first known example of a hidden-variable theory, presented by Louis de Broglie in 1927. Its more modern version, the de Broglie–Bohm theory, interprets quantum mechanics as a deterministic theory, and avoids issues such as wave function collapse, and the paradox of Schrödinger&#x27;s cat by being inherently nonlocal.

The de Broglie–Bohm pilot wave theory is one of several interpretations of (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics.

==History==
Louis de Broglie&#x27;s early results on the pilot wave theory were presented in his thesis (1924) in the context of atomic orbitals where the waves are stationary. Early attempts to develop a general formulation for the dynamics of these guiding waves in terms of a relativistic wave equation were unsuccessful until in 1926 Schrödinger developed his non-relativistic wave equation. He further suggested that since the equation described waves in configuration space, the particle model should be abandoned. Shortly thereafter, Max Born suggested that the wave function of Schrödinger&#x27;s wave equation represents the probability density of finding a particle. Following these results, de Broglie developed the dynamical equations for his pilot wave theory. Initially, de Broglie proposed a &quot;double solution&quot; approach, in which the quantum object consists of a physical wave (&quot;u&quot;-wave) in real space which has a spherical singular region that gives rise to particle-like behaviour; in this initial form of his theory he did not have to postulate the existence of a quantum particle. He later formulated it as a theory in which a particle is accompanied by a pilot wave.

De Broglie presented the pilot wave theory at the 1927 Solvay Conference. However, Wolfgang Pauli raised an objection to it at the conference, saying that it did not deal properly with the case of inelastic scattering. De Broglie was not able to find a response to this objection, and he abandoned the pilot-wave approach. Unlike David Bohm years later, de Broglie did not complete his theory to encompass the many-particle case. The many-particle case shows mathematically that the energy dissipation in inelastic scattering could be distributed to the surrounding field structure by a yet-unknown mechanism of the theory of hidden variables.

In 1932, John von Neumann published a book, part of which claimed to prove that all hidden variable theories were impossible. This result was found to be flawed by Grete Hermann three years later, though for a variety of reasons this went unnoticed by the physics community for over fifty years.

In 1952, David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie&#x27;s pilot wave theory. Bohm developed pilot wave theory into what is now called the de Broglie–Bohm theory. The de Broglie–Bohm theory itself might have gone unnoticed by most physicists, if it had not been championed by John Bell, who also countered the objections to it. In 1987, John Bell rediscovered Grete Hermann&#x27;s work, and thus showed the physics community that Pauli&#x27;s and von Neumann&#x27;s objections only showed that the pilot wave theory did not have locality.

==The pilot wave theory==

===Principles===

The pilot wave theory is a hidden-variable theory. Consequently:
* the theory has realism (meaning that its concepts exist independently of the observer);
* the theory has determinism.

The positions of the particles are considered to be the hidden variables. The observer doesn&#x27;t know the precise values of these variables; they cannot know them precisely because any measurement disturbs them. On the other hand, the observer is defined not by the wave function of their own atoms but by the atoms&#x27; positions. So what one sees around oneself are also the positions of nearby things, not their wave functions.

A collection of particles has an associated matter wave which evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. Each particle follows a deterministic trajectory, which is guided by the wave function; collectively, the density of the particles conforms to the magnitude of the wave function. The wave function is not influenced by the particle and can exist also as an empty wave function.

The theory brings to light nonlocality that is implicit in the non-relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics and uses it to satisfy Bell&#x27;s theorem. These nonlocal effects can be shown to be compatible with the no-communication theorem, which prevents use of them for faster-than-light communication, and so is empirically compatible with relativity.

==Macroscopic analog==
Couder, Fort, &quot;et al.&quot; claimed that macroscopic oil droplets on a vibrating fluid bath can be used as an analogue model of pilot waves; a localized droplet creates a periodical wave field around itself. They proposed that resonant interaction between the droplet and its own wave field exhibits behaviour analogous to quantum particles: interference in double-slit experiment, unpredictable tunneling (depending in a complicated way on a practically hidden state of field), orbit quantization (that a particle has to &#x27;find a resonance&#x27; with field perturbations it creates—after one orbit, its internal phase has to return to the initial state) and Zeeman effect. While attempts to reproduce these experiments have shown some aspects to be questionable 
and the interpretation with respect to quantum mechanics has been challenged, 
work on the concept has continued with some success.

==Mathematical foundations==
To derive the de Broglie–Bohm pilot-wave for an electron, the quantum Lagrangian

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the potential energy, formula_3 is the velocity and formula_4 is the potential associated with the quantum force (the particle being pushed by the wave function), is integrated along precisely one path (the one the electron actually follows). This leads to the following formula for the Bohm propagator:

:formula_5

This propagator allows one to precisely track the electron over time under the influence of the quantum potential formula_4.

===Derivation of the Schrödinger equation===
Pilot wave theory is based on Hamilton–Jacobi dynamics, rather than Lagrangian or Hamiltonian dynamics. Using the Hamilton–Jacobi equation

:formula_7

it is possible to derive the Schrödinger equation:

Consider a classical particle – the position of which is not known with certainty. We must deal with it statistically, so only the probability density formula_8 is known. Probability must be conserved, i.e. formula_9 for each formula_10. Therefore, it must satisfy the continuity equation

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the velocity of the particle.

In the Hamilton–Jacobi formulation of classical mechanics, velocity is given by formula_13 where formula_14 is a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation

:formula_15

formula_16 and formula_17 can be combined into a single complex equation by introducing the complex function formula_18 then the two equations are equivalent to

:formula_19
with
:formula_20

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is obtained if we start with formula_21 the usual potential with an extra quantum potential formula_4. The quantum potential is the potential of the quantum force, which is proportional (in approximation) to the curvature of the amplitude of the wave function.

Note this potential is the same one that appears in the Madelung equations, a classical analog of the Schrödinger equation.

===Mathematical formulation for a single particle===
The matter wave of de Broglie is described by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

:formula_23

The complex wave function can be represented as:

formula_24

By plugging this into the Schrödinger equation, one can derive two new equations for the real variables. The first is the continuity equation for the probability density formula_25

:formula_26

where the velocity field is determined by the “guidance equation”

:formula_27

According to pilot wave theory, the point particle and the matter wave are both real and distinct physical entities (unlike standard quantum mechanics, which postulates no physical particle or wave entities, only observed wave-particle duality). 
The pilot wave guides the motion of the point particles as described by the guidance equation.

Ordinary quantum mechanics and pilot wave theory are based on the same partial differential equation. The main difference is that in ordinary quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation is connected to reality by the Born postulate, which states that the probability density of the particle&#x27;s position is given by formula_28 Pilot wave theory considers the guidance equation to be the fundamental law, and sees the Born rule as a derived concept.

The second equation is a modified Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the action :

:formula_29

where is the quantum potential defined by

:formula_30

If we choose to neglect , our equation is reduced to the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of a classical point particle. So, the quantum potential is responsible for all the mysterious effects of quantum mechanics.

One can also combine the modified Hamilton–Jacobi equation with the guidance equation to derive a quasi-Newtonian equation of motion

:formula_31

where the hydrodynamic time derivative is defined as

:formula_32

===Mathematical formulation for multiple particles===
The Schrödinger equation for the many-body wave function formula_33 is given by

:formula_34

The complex wave function can be represented as:

:formula_35

The pilot wave guides the motion of the particles. The guidance equation for the jth particle is:

:formula_36

The velocity of the jth particle explicitly depends on the positions of the other particles.
This means that the theory is nonlocal.

===Relativity===

An extension to the relativistic case with spin has been developed since the 1990s.

===Empty wave function===
Lucien Hardy and John Stewart Bell have emphasized that in the de Broglie–Bohm picture of quantum mechanics there can exist empty waves, represented by wave functions propagating in space and time but not carrying energy or momentum, and not associated with a particle. The same concept was called &quot;ghost waves&quot; (or &quot;Gespensterfelder&quot;, &quot;ghost fields&quot;) by Albert Einstein. The empty wave function notion has been discussed controversially. In contrast, the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics does not call for empty wave functions.

<doc id="1190888" wikidata="Q7290053" url="?curid=1190888" title="Rampton Secure Hospital">
<text>Rampton Secure Hospital is a high-security psychiatric hospital near the village of Woodbeck between Retford and Rampton in Nottinghamshire, England. It is one of three high-security psychiatric hospitals in England, alongside Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire. It is managed by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

==History==
In 1899 the Lunacy Commissioners decided an additional facility was required as &quot;overspill&quot; for Broadmoor Asylum in Berkshire. Three sites were assessed in Nottinghamshire and Woodbeck Farm was chosen because of its proximity to a large supply of soft water. The farm was later to give its name to the housing built for staff.

The site was acquired in 1907 and building began in 1909, with the original building being designed by Francis William Troup. The facility opened in 1912 as Rampton Criminal Lunatic Asylum.

During the First World War, Broadmoor revised its discharge policy. This meant there were many more beds available and Rampton was no longer needed. Remaining staff and patients were transferred to Broadmoor and the Rampton site was temporarily closed in February 1920.

Some female patients were transferred to Warwick State Institution from 1923. Female patients who were classified as more &#x27;hopeful&#x27; were kept at Rampton for specialised training. Some women were sent into domestic service.

The Second World War caused staff shortages and therapeutic occupational activities had to be limited. Patients contributed to the war effort by knitting hats, gloves and pullovers and growing food.

When the National Health Service (NHS) was introduced in 1948, Rampton was transferred to the Ministry of Health, although it remained under the management of the Board of Control. The Mental Health Act 1959 saw Rampton recategorized as a Special Hospital and the Ministry of Health assumed responsibility (this was later taken over by the Department of Health and Social Services). The three UK special hospitals, including Rampton, were managed through the Special Hospitals Office Committee.

In 1962 the Special Hospitals Office Committee (SHOC) stated that it was undesirable to have children under 10 admitted to Rampton, but under 18s continued to be admitted into the 1980s.

In 1967 the League of Friends of Rampton Hospital was established to provide patient comforts, transport for relatives, and a volunteer befriending scheme. The Patient Amenities Fund was formed in 1969 through a bequest from Mrs Phoebe Boddy to provide comforts and amenities to patients. This was wound up in 1998.

In February 2000, the hospital was awarded a Charter Mark award. This government scheme was designed to both reward excellence and encourage constant quality improvement. The scheme laid emphasis on the quality of service provided to users including visitors and the general public.

In 2001 Rampton Hospital Authority was renamed Rampton Secure Hospital. In April of that year, the hospital, which had previously been administered by the Home Office, became managed by the new Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, a provider of mental health services in the local area.

==Current services==
Rampton Hospital houses about 400 patients who have been detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 under the criteria of &quot;mental disorder&quot; (any disorder or disability of mind). It has a staff of about 2,000 and provides the national services for patients with a learning disability, women and deaf men requiring high-security care. It also provides services for men with mental illness and personality disorders. The hospital has an &#x27;Enhanced Personality Disorder&#x27; unit originally opened in 2004 as part of a national pilot for &#x27;Dangerous and Severe Personality Disordered&#x27; men.

==Buildings and facilities==
The Mike Harris Centre is a new training building named after the consultant forensic psychiatrist who led the forensic division of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, opening in January 2011.

The David Wilson Unit, for National High Secure Learning Disability Services, opened in July 2011.

==Staff==
In 1920 staff worked 60 hour weeks for £50 per year, which was a wage comparable with farm labourers. Prior to the Second World War, they were required to live on-site, partly because of the remoteness of the site which was regularly cut off by snow in winter. There were quarters for single staff and houses for married male staff and their families. A housing estate - named Woodbeck - was built for this purpose along with other facilities. These included an outdoor arena, an indoor gymnasium and a swimming pool, which were added in the 1960s.

During the hospital&#x27;s history it has sometimes been hard to recruit and retain staff - for example, during the war years, because of its isolated location and because of the, at times, stressful nature of the work. Staff are sometimes injured by patients who can be violent as well as mentally ill. A report released under the Freedom of Information Act said that 4,000 attacks were recorded between 2004 and 2006 on staff in the UK&#x27;s three high-security special hospitals, including Rampton, equating to 27 attacks per week on average.

Coral Ward, a six-bed unit within the National High Secure Healthcare Service for Women, which cares for complex and challenging patients with mental illness, personality disorders and learning disabilities, won the Team of the Year award at the 2019 HSJ Patient Safety Awards.

==Criticism==
On 22 May 1979, Yorkshire Television broadcast an exposé programme titled &quot;Rampton, The Secret Hospital&quot;, alleging many serious instances of ill-treatment of patients by members of the staff at the hospital. It was billed as a groundbreaking look inside the hitherto &#x27;secret world&#x27; of a special hospital, and has been cited in a &quot;top ten&quot; of television programmes which occasioned intense public debate, being awarded an International Emmy.

A follow-up television broadcast a few weeks later further alleged that the immediate effect within the hospital had amounted to a few scapegoat prosecutions while the status quo continued as before, except that no staff member could trust another not to be a whistle-blower.

The documentary led to an inquiry by Sir John Boynton. The report found serious problems relating to the geographical and professional isolation of the hospital, its failure of leadership and its difficulty in recruiting staff as well as its focus on containing troublesome patients rather than providing proper therapy for them. Boynton was also highly critical of the internal complaints procedure: out of 178 complaints not a single one had been upheld over a four-year period. The report was also highly critical of the hospital&#x27;s management structure, saying that it was overreliant on central government, and made 205 recommendations. Boynton suggested strengthening the management and recommended that a Review Board should be set up to oversee the implementation of his recommendations. Other recommendations included a longer day for patients, greater integration between the sexes (both of patients and staff), and a smaller patient population (to 500/600 beds).

However, the documentary was controversial and was rebuffed by (among others) Bassetlaw MP Joe Ashton, who pointed out that far from being &#x27;secret&#x27;, Rampton had been subjected to regular reports and examinations by a wide variety of public bodies over many years; that it saw over 1,000 visitors a year; and that the two patients who made the allegations were not reliable witnesses, as they both had serious mental health problems and had committed serious crimes after being released. Ashton highlighted a wide range of issues he regarded as being unfair in subsequent media coverage and characterised the situation as &quot;trial by television&quot;, commenting that staff were unable to refute the allegations because they were bound by the Official Secrets Act and the confidentiality requirements of their job. He noted that the Boynton report did not uphold the core allegations: &quot;It recommended about 200 changes to the hospital, of which 195 were fairly trivial technical administrative changes which were in progress anyway. The vast majority of the evidence of the Boynton committee exonerated the staff and found that there was no evidence of brutality or practices such as [the allegations of] using a wet towel around the neck to restrain patients&quot;. However, as a result of the Boynton Report the government introduced the Mental Health Act 1983. The act, among other matters, enhanced the importance of a patient&#x27;s consent to treatment.

Rampton was rated as “inadequate” by the Care Quality Commission in 2019 - this was mainly due to low staffing levels. The standard was said to have fallen since 2018, when it was rated as “requiring improvement”.

In December 2019 the trust set up a dedicated improvement board to try to “deal with cultural issues” which includes representatives of NHS England, the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, and the Care Quality Commission.

<text>Alexander Wright VC (1826 – 28 July 1858) was a British Army soldier and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==

Alexander Wright was born in Ballymena, in what is now Northern Ireland.

==Details==
He was about 29 years old, and a private in the 77th (East Middlesex) Regiment of Foot (later The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own)), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 March 1855 at the Siege of Sebastopol, in the Crimean Peninsula, Private Wright distinguished himself in repelling a sortie. On 19 April he showed great bravery at the taking of the Russian Rifle Pits and was particularly noticed for the encouragement he gave the other men while holding the Pits under very heavy fire; he was wounded in this action. He again showed great courage on 30 August 1855, and throughout the war.

Wright and John Park were the only two soldiers of the 77th Regiment awarded the Victoria Cross for the Crimean War. In 1857, both were with their regiment when it was allotted to New South Wales and missed the first VC investiture at Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857. The medals were sent to the General Officer Commanding New South Wales who presented the medals in Sydney in 1858 as the regiment was preparing to sail to India. Craig Wilcox notes ‘The Victoria Crosses awarded Sergeant Park and Private Wright of the 77th Regiment were conferred hastily, almost furtively, as the regiment was about to leave Sydney, to help suppress the Indian Mutiny’.

He was killed in action on 28 July 1858 during intense fighting in Calcutta. His body was not recovered and he has no known grave.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (Queen&#x27;s and Royal Hampshires) Museum in Dover Castle, England.

<text>A hydraulic press is a machine press using a hydraulic cylinder to generate a compressive force. It uses the hydraulic equivalent of a mechanical lever, and was also known as a Bramah press after the inventor, Joseph Bramah, of England. He invented and was issued a patent on this press in 1795. As Bramah (who is also known for his development of the flush toilet) installed toilets, he studied the existing literature on the motion of fluids and put this knowledge into the development of the press.

==Main principle==
The hydraulic press depends on Pascal&#x27;s principle. The pressure throughout a closed system is constant. One part of the system is a piston acting as a pump, with a modest mechanical force acting on a small cross-sectional area; the other part is a piston with a larger area which generates a correspondingly large mechanical force. Only small-diameter tubing (which more easily resists pressure) is needed if the pump is separated from the press cylinder.

==Application==
Hydraulic presses are commonly used for assembly and disassembly of tightly-fitting components. In manufacturing, they are used for forging, clinching, molding, blanking, punching, deep drawing, and metal forming operations. Hydraulic presses are also used for stretch forming, rubber pad forming, and powder compacting. The hydraulic press is advantageous in manufacturing, it gives the ability to create more intricate shapes and can be economical with materials. A hydraulic press will take up less space compared to a mechanical press of the same capability.

In geology a tungsten carbide coated hydraulic press is used in the rock crushing stage of preparing samples for geochemical analyses in topics such as understanding the origins of volcanism.

==In popular culture==

The room featured in &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Room&quot; has a design similar to that of a hydraulic press. Boris Artzybasheff also created a drawing of a hydraulic press, in which the press was created out of the shape of a robot.

In 2015, the Hydraulic Press Channel, a YouTube channel dedicated to crushing objects with a hydraulic press, was created by bengie
, a factory owner from Tampere, Finland. The Hydraulic Press Channel has since grown to over 9 million subscribers on YouTube. There are numerous other YouTube channels that publish videos involving hydraulic presses that are tasked with crushing many different items, such as bowling balls, soda cans, plastic toys, and metal tools.

A hydraulic press features prominently in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot;.

<text>Krishikar Lok Party (Peasants People&#x27;s Party) was a political party in the Hyderabad State, India, which existed from April to June 1951. The KLP was formed when Acharya N. G. Ranga separated from the Hyderabad State Praja Party.

KLP contested 1952 Madras Legislative Assembly election and won 15 seats. In 1959, N. G. Ranga, along with C. Rajagopalachari, broke away from the Congress party and established the Swatantra Party due to their dissatisfaction with Nehru&#x27;s increasingly socialist policies, including the implementation of land reforms and cooperative farming processes. Ranga assumed the role of its first president of the Swatantra Party.

== History ==
The Krishikar Lok Party (KLP) was founded by N.G. Ranga, who left the Congress after losing the 1951 election for Congress president. Dissatisfied, Ranga, along with Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu, formed the Praja Party and attended a Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party meeting in Patna. During the formation of a sub-committee, Prakasam&#x27;s name was included, but Ranga&#x27;s followers&#x27; request to include his name was ignored. Dissatisfied, Ranga left the Congress and established the KLP with support from followers in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.

Key members of the party like Kandula Obul Reddy, Peddireddy Timmareddy, Gouthu Latchanna, Bharati Devi, V.V. Ramana, N.V. Naidu, Chegireddi Bali Reddi and Paturi Rajagopala Naidu were instrumental in implementing the party&#x27;s program.

=== 1951 by-election ===
The State convention of the party took place in Tenali, Andhra Pradesh in 1951, drawing a large crowd. The party decided to participate in the Duggirala by-election, putting forward Ancha Venkateswarlu as its candidate with high expectations. Venkateswarlu was defeated by Congress candidate, Meduri Nageswara Rao.

=== 1951 Lok Sabha elections ===
KLP contested the 1951 Lok Sabha elections, winning one seat for the party from the Bharatpur Sawaimadhopur constituency.

=== 1952 General election ===
In the 1952 General Elections, the party fielded candidates, including N.G. Ranga and his wife Bharati Devi, in key constituencies but only managed to win 19 seats. None of the seats were secured in Krishna district and Guntur district, where the party was popular. Neerukunda Rama Rao won a seat in East Godavari district due to his personal reputation. The remaining 18 seats came from Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam in one corner of the state and Chittoor from another corner. Timma Reddy and Gouthu Latchanna were important elected candidates. The Krishikar Lok Party played an important role in the Madras State Legislative Assembly by supporting C. Rajagopalachari in forming the ministry.

=== 1955 Andhra State Legislative Assembly election ===
In the 1955 Andhra State Legislative Assembly election, an alliance was formed among Indian National Congress, Praja Party and KLP, resulting in KLP winning 22 seats. Following the election, upon Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s request, Ranga merged KLP with the Congress party. He was elected to the Congress in the 1957 general election from the Tenali Lok Sabha constituency.

<text>In aeronautics, air brakes, or speed brakes, are a type of flight control surface used on an aircraft to increase the drag on the aircraft. When extended into the airstream, air brakes cause an increase in the drag on the aircraft. When not in use, they conform to the local streamlined profile of the aircraft in order to help minimize drag.

Air brakes differ from spoilers in that air brakes are designed to increase drag while making little change to lift, whereas spoilers reduce the lift-to-drag ratio and require a higher angle of attack to maintain lift, resulting in a higher stall speed. However, flight spoilers are routinely referred to as &quot;speed brakes&quot; on transport aircraft by pilots and manufacturers, despite significantly reducing lift.

== History ==
In the early decades of powered flight, air brakes were flaps mounted on the wings. They were manually controlled by a lever in the cockpit, and mechanical linkages to the air brake.

An early type of air brake, developed in 1931, was fitted to the aircraft wing support struts.

In 1936, Hans Jacobs, who headed Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS) glider research organization before World War II, developed blade-style self-operating dive brakes, on the upper and lower surface of each wing, for gliders. Most early gliders were equipped with spoilers on the wings in order to adjust their angle of descent during approach to landing. More modern gliders use air brakes that may spoil lift as well as increase drag, dependent on where they are positioned.

A British report written in 1942 discusses the need for dive brakes to enable dive bombers, torpedo bombers and fighter aircraft to meet their respective combat performance requirements and, more generally, glide-path control. It discusses different types of air brakes and their requirements, in particular that they should have no appreciable effect on lift or trim and how this may be achieved with split trailing edge flaps on the wings, for example. There was also a requirement to vent the brake surfaces using numerous perforations or slots to reduce airframe buffeting.

A US report written in 1949 describes numerous air brake configurations, and their performance, on wings and fuselage for propeller and jet aircraft.

==Air brake configurations==
Often, characteristics of both spoilers and air brakes are desirable and are combinedmost modern airliner jets feature combined spoiler and air brake controls. On landing, the deployment of these spoilers (&quot;lift dumpers&quot;) causes a significant reduction in wing lift, so the weight of the aircraft is transferred from the wings to the undercarriage. The increased weight increases the available friction force for braking. In addition, the form drag created by the spoilers directly assists the braking effect. Reverse thrust is also used to help slow the aircraft after landing.

Virtually all jet-powered aircraft have an air brake or, in the case of most airliners, flight spoilers that also generate drag, albeit with the additional lift dumping effect. Propeller-driven aircraft benefit from the natural braking effect of the propeller when engine power is reduced to idle, but jet engines have no similar braking effect, so jet-powered aircraft must use air brakes to control speed and descent angle during landing approach. Many early jets used parachutes as air brakes on approach (Arado Ar 234, Boeing B-47) or after landing (English Electric Lightning).

Split-tailcone air brakes have been used on the Blackburn Buccaneer naval strike aircraft designed in the 1950s and Fokker F28 Fellowship and British Aerospace 146 airliners. The Buccaneer air brake, when opened, reduced the length of the aircraft in the confined space on an aircraft carrier.

The F-15 Eagle, Sukhoi Su-27, F-18 Hornet and other fighters have an air brake located just behind the cockpit.

==Split control surfaces==
The deceleron is an aileron that functions normally in flight but can split in half such that the top half goes up as the bottom half goes down to brake. This technique was first used on the F-89 Scorpion and has since been used by Northrop on several aircraft, including the B-2 Spirit.

The Space Shuttle used a similar system. The vertically split rudder opened in &quot;clamshell&quot; fashion on landing to act as a speed brake.

<text>Thomas Israel Banks (born April 19, 1949 in New York City) is a theoretical physicist and professor at Rutgers University and University of California, Santa Cruz.

==Work==
Banks&#x27; work centers around string theory and its applications to high energy particle physics and cosmology. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. In 1973–86 he was appointed at the Tel Aviv University. He was several times a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (1976–78, 1983–84, 2010).

Along with Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind, he is one of the four originators of M(atrix) theory, or BFSS Matrix Theory, an attempt to formulate M theory in a nonperturbative manner. Banks proposed a conjecture known as Asymptotic Darkness - it posits that the physics above the Planck scale is dominated by black hole production. He has often criticized the widely held assumption in the string theory community that background spacetimes with different asymptotics can represent different vacua states of the same theory of quantum gravity. Rather, Banks argues that different asymptotics correspond to different models of quantum gravity. Many of his arguments for this and other ideas are contained in his paper &quot;A Critique of Pure String Theory: Heterodox Opinions of Diverse Dimensions.&quot; published in 2003.

<text>Nix v. Hedden, 149 U.S. 304 (1893), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court unanimously held that tomatoes should be classified as vegetables rather than fruits for purposes of tariffs, imports and customs. Justice Horace Gray delivered the opinion of the Court in holding that the Tariff Act of 1883 used the ordinary meaning of the words &quot;fruit&quot; and &quot;vegetable&quot;, instead of the technical botanical meaning.

==Background==

John Nix founded the John Nix &amp; Co. fruit commission in New York City in 1839. The company became one of the largest sellers of produce in New York City at the time, and was one of the first companies to ship produce from Virginia, Florida, and Bermuda to New York.

On March 3, 1883, President Chester A. Arthur signed the Tariff Act of 1883, requiring a tax to be paid on imported vegetables, but not fruit. The John Nix &amp; Co. company filed a suit against Edward L. Hedden, Collector of the Port of New York, to recover back duties paid under protest. They argued against the tariff by pointing out that, botanically, a tomato is a fruit due to its seed-bearing structure growing from the flowering part of a plant.

At the trial, the plaintiffs&#x27; counsel entered into evidence definitions of the words &quot;fruit&quot; and &quot;vegetables&quot; from &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Worcester&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, and the &quot;Imperial Dictionary&quot;. They called two witnesses, who had been in the business of selling fruit and vegetables for 30 years, and asked them, after hearing these definitions, to say whether these words had &quot;any special meaning in trade or commerce, different from those read&quot;.

During testimony, one witness testified that in regard to the dictionary definition:

Another witness testified that &quot;I don&#x27;t think the term &#x27;fruit&#x27; or the term &#x27;vegetables&#x27; had, in March 1883, and prior thereto, any special meaning in trade and commerce in this country different from that which I have read here from the dictionaries.&quot;

Both the plaintiffs&#x27; counsel and the defendant&#x27;s counsel made use of the dictionaries. The plaintiffs&#x27; counsel read in evidence from the same dictionaries the definitions of the word tomato, while the defendant&#x27;s counsel then read in evidence from &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; the definitions of the words pea, eggplant, cucumber, squash, and pepper. Countering this, the plaintiff then read in evidence from &quot;Webster&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Worcester&#x27;s&quot; dictionaries the definitions of potato, turnip, parsnip, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot and bean.

==Decision==

The court unanimously decided in favor of the respondent and found that the tomato should be classified under the customs regulations as a vegetable, based on the ways in which it is used, and the popular perception to this end. Justice Horace Gray, writing the opinion for the Court, stated that:

Justice Gray, citing several Supreme Court cases (&quot;Brown v. Piper,&quot; 91 U.S. 37, 42, and &quot;Jones v. U.S.,&quot; 137 U.S. 202, 216) stated that when words have acquired no special meaning in trade or commerce, the ordinary meaning must be used by the court. In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray acknowledged that botanically, tomatoes are classified as a &quot;fruit of the vine&quot;; nevertheless, they are seen as vegetables because they were usually eaten as a main course instead of being eaten as a dessert. In making his decision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that beans were seeds — Justice Bradley, in &quot;Robertson v. Salomon,&quot; 130 U.S. 412, 414, similarly found that though a bean is botanically a seed, in common parlance a bean is seen as a vegetable. While on the subject, Gray clarified the status of the cucumber, squash, pea, and bean.

==Legacy==
&quot;Nix&quot; has been cited in three Supreme Court decisions as a precedent for court interpretation of common meanings, especially dictionary definitions. (&quot;Sonn v. Maggone,&quot; ; &quot;Saltonstall v. Wiebusch &amp; Hilger,&quot; ; and &quot;Cadwalader v. Zeh,&quot; ). Additionally, in &quot;JSG Trading Corp. v. Tray-Wrap, Inc.,&quot; 917 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1990), a case unrelated to &quot;Nix&quot; aside from the shared focus on tomatoes, a judge wrote the following paragraph citing the case:

In 2005, supporters in the New Jersey Legislature cited &quot;Nix&quot; as a basis for a bill designating the tomato as the official state vegetable.

<text>Maxibon is a brand of ice cream sandwich made by Froneri, and also previously owned by the Swiss company Nestlé. It consists of a block of frozen dairy dessert containing small chocolate chips with one end covered in chocolate, and the other sandwiched between two biscuits.

==History==
The Maxibon is an ice cream sandwich produced for the first time in Italy by Motta (Italgel) in 1989 and then brought to international markets by Nestlé starting from 1993 when Nestlé acquired Italgel.
Since 2016, the brand has been owned by Froneri, a joint venture between the English R&amp;R Ice Cream and Nestlé itself.

The Maxibon bar is available in Europe, Canada, Australia, Chile, Egypt and New Zealand and can be purchased from &#x27;Maxibon Zone&#x27; stands in European cities, such as Madrid. There are three available variations of Maxibon in Europe including vanilla, white chocolate and original flavour. There are also specials released from time to time, with unique flavors as well.

In 2022, Nestlé discontinued Maxibon in the UK.

==Varieties==
There have been at least ten known varieties of Maxibon:

* Classic: (also called Vanilla) Made of vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips, with a half biscuit, half chocolate shell, together with hazelnuts and crumbs of biscuit.
* Honeycomb: A variant of the traditional Maxibon with honeycomb flavoured ice cream in place of vanilla.
* Caramel Rough Nut: the same shape as the original Maxibon, but with caramel ice cream instead of vanilla, and ripples of caramel sauce through the half of the ice cream that is encased in biscuit
* Monster Cookie: Cookies and cream flavoured ice cream with chocolate cookie bits, with half encased in the classic chocolate with crunchy cookie pieces and the other half sandwiched between two biscuits.
* Waffle: Vanilla ice cream with caramelised sugar pieces jammed between two honey-covered waffle biscuits on one side and dipped in caramel white choc with hazelnuts and cookie crumb on the other side.
* Peanut Butter and Jam: Peanut butter flavoured ice cream throughout with jam ripples in the biscuit section.
* Iced Coffee: Iced coffee flavoured ice cream with chocolate chips, with half encased in the classic chocolate and the other half sandwiched between two biscuits. Also sold as Maxi-Dare, made with Dare Iced Coffee.
* Cereal: With cereal and covered in white chocolate
* Mint: (also called That&#x27;s Mint). Mint flavoured ice cream with chocolate chips between two traditional chocolate flavoured biscuits.

===Previous variants===

* Cookie: Circular, with ice cream, chocolate chips and caramel sauce sandwiched between two chocolate chip &#x27;cookies&#x27;.
* Snack: A half sized version of the original Maxibon, weighing 56g instead of the standard 102g.
* Risk: Regular size and shape however the flavour of ice cream, either vanilla, honeycomb or mint, was not known until the package was opened.
* Krispy Kreme: A collaboration with Krispy Kreme donuts with a flavour based on their original glazed doughnut. Available in Australia for a limited time.
* Pickle Rick Mint: Mint-flavoured ice cream with mint choc-chip ice cream, a limited-edition collaboration with the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; cartoon in 2021.

==In popular culture==
The Australian adventure game show &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;, featured a segment called the &quot;Maxibon Challenge&quot;. Usually involving Whitney who roams around in a mall finding strangers where if a contestant can manage to eat a Maxibon ice cream sandwich within 30 seconds. Then either he or she would be awarded AU$50.00 and be dubbed as a &quot;Whitney Warrior&quot; (an award named after its host Mike Whitney).
The Maxibon featured in Pauline Hanson&#x27;s YouTube cartoon series &quot;Please Explain&quot;, Episode &quot;Airbus Albo&quot;, where a parody of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese exclaims that &quot;Maxibons are two for $55!&quot; (an exaggerated example of inflation).

<doc id="1190923" wikidata="Q3066253" url="?curid=1190923" title="Family Records Centre">
<text>The Family Records Centre (FRC) provided access to family history research sources mainly for England and Wales. It was administered jointly by the General Register Office (GRO) and The National Archives. It opened in March 1997 and was fully operational by the following month. It was situated in Taylor House at 1 Myddelton Street, Clerkenwell, London, at that street&#x27;s junction with Garnault Place and close to the London Metropolitan Archives. It closed in 2008.

Throughout the FRC, there was free access to a wide range of family history material, databases and internet websites. Staff were always available to provide help and advice on family history research and there were regular one-to-one family history surgeries and computer skills tutorials. Talks on family history topics took place every week and other events, including exhibitions and conferences, were organised. There were good facilities for customers with special needs, and there was a small bookshop next to the entrance on the ground floor and a refreshment area with vending machines and lockers for personal belongings in the basement.

Its main resources were indexes to civil registration of births, marriages and deaths on the ground floor (provided by the GRO), and the Victorian census returns on the first floor (provided by The National Archives).

==Births, Marriages &amp; Deaths Indexes==

The births, marriages and deaths indexes were in large, heavy, hardcover books (red covers for births, green for marriages and black for deaths) in three sections respectively, with each section arranged in date order. Using the details from an index, a copy (certificate) of the corresponding birth, marriage or death entry could be applied for at the cashiers&#x27; section on the same floor. Other indexes at the FRC included some births, marriages and deaths of British nationals which took place abroad from 1761, indexes of legal adoptions in England &amp; Wales from 1927 onwards, and various indexes of war deaths in the armed forces in South Africa, both World Wars and elsewhere.

The births, marriages and deaths indexes were originally at Somerset House until the 1970s. In the early 1980s, the births and marriages indexes were at St Catherine&#x27;s House, at the northeast corner of the intersection of Kingsway and Aldwych, and the deaths indexes were at Alexandra House, farther up Kingsway. After more space was made available at St Catherine&#x27;s House, the deaths indexes were moved from Alexandra House. Finally, they were all moved to the FRC in 1997.

==Census returns for England and Wales==
The 1841 to 1901 census returns for England and Wales could be consulted at the FRC and were accessed mainly online by searching for individuals by name. The 1841 to 1891 census returns were also available on microfilm, while the 1901 census was also available on microfiche. A selection of street indexes and other search aids were also available.

Before the FRC opened, the census microfilms were at the Public Record Office (now part of the National Archives) in Chancery Lane for some years, after having been moved from the Land Registry building, Portugal Street, London, where they had been since the mid-1970s.

==Other microfilm resources==

Other microfilm resources available included wills and administrations from the Prerogative Court of Canterbury up to 1858, which could also be searched online, death duty registers, from 1796 to 1858, and many nonconformist registers (mainly pre-1837).

==Demise==

On 21 June 2006, it was announced that the National Archives&#x27; staff and residual services at the FRC would be relocating to the National Archives at Kew by the end of 2008. Official press releases were vague about plans for the births, marriages and deaths indexes housed on the ground floor. During October 2007 the index volumes in question were progressively removed from public access to a closed archive in Christchurch, Dorset.

The closure date was later brought forward to early 2008. The ground floor (GRO section) of the FRC closed on 27 October 2007 and the rest of the FRC closed on 15 March 2008. As of 2010 Taylor House was being refurbished by property developers Derwent London; the lower ground floor had been pre-let to nearby City University for twenty years at £1.2m per year. The second floor now has twenty courtrooms where Immigration and Asylum Tribunal cases are heard.

<text>Elizabeth Harden Gilmore (1909–1986) was a business leader and civil rights advocate.

She was the first woman to be licensed as an assistant funeral director in Kanawha County, West Virginia on October 28, 1938, and as a funeral director on November 12, 1940. She opened the Harden and Harden Funeral Home in 1947 (now listed on the National Register of Historic Places).

She pioneered efforts to integrate West Virginia&#x27;s schools, housing, and public accommodations and to pass civil rights legislation enforcing such integration. In the early 1950s, before the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision mandating school desegregation, Gilmore formed a women&#x27;s club which opened Charleston&#x27;s first integrated day care center. At about the same time, she succeeded in getting her black Girl Scouts of the USA troop admitted to Camp Anne Bailey near the mountain town of Lewisburg. The two Girl Scouts that she sponsored to integrate Camp Anne Bailey were Deloris Foster and Linda Stillwell. Her Girl Scout Troop, 230 was, also, the first black troop to graduate from Girl Scouting in West Virginia. After co-founding the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1958, she led CORE in a successful one-year-long sit-in campaign at a local department store called The Diamond.

In the 1960s, Gilmore served on the Kanawha Valley Council of Human Relations, where she participated in forums on racial differences and where she helped black renters, displaced by a new interstate highway, find housing. Her successful push to amend the 1961 state civil rights law won her a seat on the powerful higher-education Board of Regents. Gilmore was the first African American to receive such an honor. She stayed on the Board from 1969 to the late 1970s, serving one term as vice-president and one term as president. Her tireless commitment to civil and human rights did not end there. She was also involved with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and community education and welfare committees.

<doc id="1190931" wikidata="Q24075" url="?curid=1190931" title="Godzilla (1998 film)">
<text>Godzilla is a 1998 American monster film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. Produced by TriStar Pictures, Centropolis Entertainment, Fried Films, and Independent Pictures, and distributed by TriStar, it is a reboot of Toho Co., Ltd.&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. It is also the 23rd film in the franchise and the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; film to be completely produced by a Hollywood studio. The film stars Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Maria Pitillo, Hank Azaria, Kevin Dunn, Michael Lerner, and Harry Shearer. The film is dedicated to Tomoyuki Tanaka, the co-creator and producer of various &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, who died in April 1997. In the film, authorities investigate and battle a giant monster who migrates to New York City to nest its young.

In October 1992, TriStar announced plans to produce a trilogy of &quot;Godzilla&quot; films. In May 1993, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were hired to write the script. In July 1994, Jan de Bont was announced as the director but left the project that December due to budget disputes. Emmerich was hired in May 1996 to direct and co-write a new script with producer Dean Devlin. Principal photography began in May 1997 and ended in September 1997.

&quot;Godzilla&quot; was theatrically released on May 20, 1998, to negative reviews and grossed $379 million worldwide against a production budget between $130–150 million and marketing costs of $80 million, becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1998. Despite turning a profit, it was considered a box office disappointment. Planned sequels were cancelled, but an was produced instead. TriStar let their remake/sequel rights expire on May 20, 2003. In 2004, Toho began trademarking new iterations of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla as &quot;Zilla&quot;, with only the incarnations from the 1998 film and animated series retaining the Godzilla copyright/trademark.

==Plot==
An iguana nest is exposed to the fallout of a military nuclear test in French Polynesia. Some time later, a Japanese cannery vessel in the South Pacific Ocean is suddenly attacked by an unknown creature, with only one fisherman surviving. While confined in a hospital in Tahiti, the traumatized survivor is visited by a mysterious Frenchman, who questions him over what he witnessed, wherein he repeatedly replies &quot;Gojira&quot;.

Meanwhile, NRC scientist Dr. Niko &quot;Nick&quot; Tatopoulos is researching the effects of radiation on wildlife in the Chernobyl exclusion zone when he is interrupted by an official from the U.S. State Department who has come to pick him up for a special assignment. Nick is sent to Panama and Jamaica to study a trail of wreckage leading to another cannery ship with massive claw marks on it. Nick identifies skin samples he discovered in the shipwreck as belonging to an unknown species. He dismisses the military&#x27;s theory of the creature being a living dinosaur, instead deducing it is a mutant created by nuclear testing.

The creature travels to New York City, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. The city is evacuated before the U.S. military, on Nick&#x27;s advice, lure the creature into revealing itself with a large pile of fish. Their attempt to kill it fails, however, and only causes further damage before it escapes. Nick collects a blood sample, and by performing a pregnancy test, discovers the creature reproduces asexually and is collecting food for its offspring. Nick also meets up with his ex-girlfriend Audrey Timmonds, a young aspiring news reporter. While she visits him, she uncovers a classified tape in his provisional military tent concerning the monster&#x27;s origins and turns it over to the media. She hopes to have her report put on TV to launch her career, but her boss Charles Caiman uses the tape in his report, declaring it his own discovery, and dubs the creature &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

As a result of the tape&#x27;s disclosure, Nick is removed from the operation and he cuts off ties with Audrey. His taxi is hijacked by the mysterious Frenchman, who identified himself as Philippe Roaché. Revealing himself as an agent of the French secret service, Philippe explains that he and his colleagues have been closely watching the events to cover up their country&#x27;s role in the nuclear testing that created Godzilla. Suspecting a nest somewhere in the city, they cooperate with Nick to trace and destroy it. Meanwhile, Godzilla resurfaces and dives into the Hudson River to evade a second attempt by the military to kill it, where it is attacked by Navy submarines. After colliding with torpedoes, Godzilla sinks, believed to be dead by the authorities.

Nick and Philippe&#x27;s team, followed by Audrey and her cameraman Victor &quot;Animal&quot; Palotti, find the nest inside Madison Square Garden, with over 200 eggs. Before long, the eggs begin to hatch and the strike team are attacked by the offspring. Nick, Animal, Audrey and Philippe take refuge in the Garden&#x27;s broadcast booth and successfully send out a live news-report to alert the military. A prompt response involving an airstrike is initiated as the four escape moments before the Air Force bomb the arena.

Audrey and Nick reconcile, before the adult Godzilla, having survived, emerges from the Garden&#x27;s ruins. Enraged by the deaths of its brood, it takes its rage out on the four, chasing them across Manhattan in a taxi. They manage to trap Godzilla within the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge, allowing the returning Air Force to strike it down with missiles. Godzilla collapses to the ground where the taxi is smashed under its jaw and slowly dies from its mortal wounds, and the remaining citizens and authorities celebrate. Audrey tells Caiman that she quits working for him after what he has done, before leaving with Nick. Philippe, taking a tape Animal was recording and promising to return it after removing certain contents, thanks Nick for his help and parts ways.

Meanwhile in the ruins of Madison Square Garden, a single surviving egg hatches and the hatchling roars to life.

===Development===

American film producer and distributor Henry G. Saperstein (who had co-produced and distributed past &quot;Godzilla&quot; films for the American market through his studio UPA) received permission from Toho Co., Ltd. to pitch a new &quot;Godzilla&quot; film to Hollywood studios, stating, &quot;For ten years I pressured Toho to make one in America. Finally they agreed.&quot; Saperstein initially met with Sony Pictures producers Cary Woods and Robert N. Fried for discussions regarding a live-action Mr. Magoo film but the discussions led to the availability of the rights to Godzilla.

Interested, Woods and Fried proposed the idea to Columbia Pictures, but were initially rejected. Woods stated, &quot;We pitched the idea to Columbia and they passed outright. Their response was they felt it had the potential for camp&quot;. The two also tried to pitch the idea to TriStar Pictures but were also shot down, Fried stated, &quot;TriStar did originally pass on the project. The people who were running the studio at that particular time may not have seen commercial potential there, may not have thought that it would make a great film.&quot;

Taking advice from his wife, Woods instead went over the executives&#x27; heads and proposed the idea to Peter Guber, the then-chairman of the board and CEO of Sony Pictures. Guber became enthusiastic about the idea, seeing Godzilla as an &quot;international brand&quot; and set the film up at TriStar. Woods recalled, &quot;Peter got it; he saw the movie in his head. He was like, &#x27;Godzilla, the fire-breathing monster?! Yesss!&#x27;&quot; TriStar vice-chairman Ken Lemberger was sent to Tokyo to oversee the deal in obtaining the Godzilla rights from Toho in mid-1992. Sony&#x27;s initial offer included a $300,000–400,000 advance payment with an annual licensing fee for the Godzilla character, as well as production bonuses, exclusive distribution and merchandising rights for Japan, a profit percentage from international ticket sales and merchandising, usage rights to some of the monsters from the first 15 &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, and allow Toho to continue producing domestic &quot;Godzilla&quot; films while TriStar developed their film. Subsequently, Toho sent Sony a document of rules on how to treat Godzilla. Robert Fried stated, &quot;They even sent me a four-page, single-spaced memo describing the physical requirements the Godzilla in our film had to have. They&#x27;re very protective.&quot;

In October 1992, TriStar formally announced their acquisition of the rights to &quot;Godzilla&quot; from Toho to produce a trilogy of &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, with the promise of &quot;remaining true to the original series—cautioning against nuclear weapons and runaway technology.&quot; After TriStar&#x27;s announcement, many of the original Godzilla filmmakers expressed support for the film; Haruo Nakajima (who portrayed Godzilla from 1954 to 1972) stated, &quot;I&#x27;m pleased. I hope that a competition will spring up between Toho and TriStar,&quot; Koichi Kawakita (special effects director of the Heisei Godzilla films) stated, &quot;I have great expectations. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it, not only because I direct special effects for Godzilla films but also because I am a movie fan,&quot; Teruyoshi Nakano (special effects director of the late Showa Godzilla films) stated, &quot;I&#x27;m pleased that a new approach will be taken&quot;, and Ishirō Honda (director of various Showa Godzilla films) stated, &quot;It will probably be much more interesting than the ones [currently] being produced in Japan.&quot;

In 1994, Jan de Bont became attached to direct and began pre-production on the film for a 1996 summer release. De Bont&#x27;s Godzilla would have discarded the character&#x27;s atomic origin and replaced it with one wherein Godzilla is an artificial creation constructed by Atlantians to defend humanity against a shape-shifting extraterrestrial monster called &quot;The Gryphon&quot;. Stan Winston and his company were employed to do the effects for the film. Winston crafted sculptures of Godzilla and The Gryphon. De Bont later left the project in December 1994 after TriStar refused to approve his budget of $100–120 million. He would later go on to direct &quot;Twister&quot; and &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;. Clive Barker and Tim Burton were also in talks to potentially direct.

===Elliott and Rossio script===
In May 1993, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were hired to write the screenplay. Prior to their hiring, Elliott and Rossio were searching for their next project and were offered &quot;Godzilla&quot; by their advisor Cary Woods. The duo initially declined the offer several times, Elliott recalled, &quot;We actually turned the project down about two or three times because we weren&#x27;t sure we knew what to do with it.&quot; Woods eventually convinced them to discuss the project with TriStar. Elliott and Rossio wrote a three and half-page story outline that secured their employment. Rossio believes that they were offered the project due to their experience in writing &quot;franchise-type titles.&quot; Robert Fried expressed support for Elliott and Rossio, praising them as &quot;talented sci-fi buffs&quot; and stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve put a lot of time, thought and finance into the screenplay.&quot; Toho&#x27;s character restrictions helped inspire Elliott and Rossio in finding the tone of the script, Elliott stated, &quot;Toho insisted we not make light of the monster. That helped us find the right tone as well as the social and political implications.&quot;

The duo wanted to avoid a comic-like approach and instead take the material seriously with a &quot;legitimate science fiction story&quot; that would evoke feelings of &quot;mystified or scared or awe-inspired&quot; for audiences. Rossio wanted to create a balance in anthropomorphizing Godzilla, not wanting to stray from Godzilla&#x27;s humanistic personality but not humanize him entirely. The duo approached Godzilla as something that audiences would fear yet root for. Elliott found the &quot;key&quot; to the story after a friend, who was also a Godzilla fan, expressed that he found Godzilla not to be a &quot;good guy&quot;, but a territorial beast, Elliott stated, &quot;And that, to me, meant that you could actually present Godzilla on the side of the angels but he could still be a monster.&quot;

The duo chose to add small details to make Godzilla seem &quot;more realistic&quot;, such as the nictitating membrane. The duo took inspiration from &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; for the story concept. As the story developed, they found that the Ahab archetype would be more interesting if it were a woman who lost her husband to Godzilla. Elliott described the story to be about obsession, redemption and &quot;inappropriate grief response.&quot; The duo also wanted to deliver a story that satisfied fans by adapting Godzilla&#x27;s characterization from the first few Toho films, Elliott stated, &quot;In one movie it does what the first three Toho films did – it takes him from being a horrendous threat to being defender of the Earth.&quot; Elliott and Rossio submitted their first draft on November 10, 1993. Woods and Fried were satisfied with the script, with Fried praising it for being &quot;respectful of the organic origins of Godzilla, in some ways a homage to US-Japanese relations.&quot;

After De Bont joined the project, Elliott and Rossio revised the script based on his notes. Amongst the changes made to the first draft were the 12-year gap condensed to a year; Jill accompanies Keith to the Arctic site; Keith first notices Godzilla&#x27;s teeth buried in ice instead of his claws; The alien probe crashes in Traveller, Utah instead of Kentucky. Elliott and Rossio remained on the project after De Bont left and completed their final rewrites in spring 1995. Prior to hiring a new director, TriStar hired Don Macpherson to rewrite the Elliott/Rossio script. Prior to his hiring, Macpherson was working on &quot;Possession&quot; until he received a call from his agent with an offer to work on &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Macpherson &quot;immediately accepted&quot; due to being a fan of the Toho &quot;Godzilla&quot; films.

Macpherson met with Marc Platt, the then-President of TriStar, to discuss the film. The studio was concerned with the film&#x27;s proposed $120 million budget, later revised to $200 million. De Bont insisted that all of the film&#x27;s effects be entirely digital, Macpherson noted, &quot;The problem was that, in this version of the movie, it was all effects. Godzilla was in virtually every scene. So everything was an SFX scene.&quot; Macpherson was tasked with rewriting the script to match TriStar&#x27;s &quot;ideal&quot; budget of $80 million. Prior to rewriting the script, he requested to meet with the production crew to pinpoint which scenes were deemed the most expensive. The production crew reported that the three main problems that were considered &quot;difficult and costly&quot; were Godzilla&#x27;s size, Godzilla&#x27;s interaction with water, and Godzilla&#x27;s interaction with masonry.

Macpherson was shown storyboards, concept art, and designs from De Bont&#x27;s version. However, he did not keep these ideas in mind, feeling that such elements would change depending on the budget. Instead, Macpherson used the Toho &quot;Godzilla&quot; design as a reference when rewriting the script. He noted that the project had transitioned into a film that turned directors away, stating, &quot;they said they wanted strong, creative directors. But they wanted them as a kind of &#x27;badge&#x27; of creative excitement and had no intention of allowing them their freedom.&quot;

While Macpherson called Elliott and Rossio&#x27;s original script &quot;terrific,&quot; he took issue with several of its ideas. He felt that the script discarded the &quot;Japanese element of post-war nuclear politics&quot; from the Toho films, leaving Godzilla as a threat to a single country rather than the world, Macpherson added, &quot;That neglected the poetic aspect of fear and wonder from the original Toho movies, and the idea of a prior &#x27;sin&#x27; which had caused the mutation and revenge of Godzilla.&quot; He felt that the script lacked proper characters and &quot;had too many extra sequences which didn&#x27;t deliver.&quot; He also took issue that the script never developed Godzilla as a character and treated him similar to The Terminator, though he suspected De Bont was responsible for this portrayal.

Macpherson felt that the script&#x27;s depiction of Godzilla was &quot;relentless&quot;, noting, &quot;very much a Godzilla POV, so you neither identified with Godzilla nor with the scientists trying to protect the world.&quot; He also took issue that the first half of the script was driven by destruction and by the script&#x27;s mid-point, there was &quot;monster fatigue&quot; and no &quot;encore,&quot; stating, &quot;So I thought the audience would be fatigued and ready for something new – and the new thing wasn&#x27;t delivered.&quot; Macpherson attempted to resolve that issue while retaining the highlights of Elliott and Rossio&#x27;s script.

In November 2018, an unofficial digital graphic novel adaptation of Elliott and Rossio&#x27;s unproduced &quot;Godzilla&quot; script was released online. Entitled &quot;Godzilla &#x27;94&quot;, the graphic novel features artwork by Todd Tennant, who worked with Rossio on the project.

===Emmerich and Devlin===
Prior to the release of &quot;Independence Day&quot;, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin signed on to the project in May 1996 under the condition they would be able to handle the film their way, Devlin stated, &quot;I told Sony that I would do the film but on my own terms, with Godzilla as a fast-moving animal out of nature, rather than some strange kind of creature.&quot; Emmerich and Devlin were the first filmmakers approached by then-TriStar executive Chris Lee to do &quot;Godzilla&quot; but initially turned the offer down, Devlin stated, &quot;Both of us thought it was a dopey idea the first time we talked. When Chris came back to us, we still thought it was a dopey idea.&quot;

Despite praising Elliott and Rossio&#x27;s script, Emmerich discarded it, stating, &quot;It had some really cool things in it, but it is something I never would have done. The last half was like watching two creatures go at it. I simply don&#x27;t like that.&quot; Emmerich instead decided to develop new ideas from scratch, stating, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to make the original &quot;Godzilla&quot;, I wanted nothing to do with it. I wanted to make my own. We took part of [the original movie&#x27;s] basic storyline, in that the creature becomes created by radiation and it becomes a big challenge. But that&#x27;s all we took. Then we asked ourselves what we would do today with a monster movie and a story like that. We forgot everything about the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; right there.&quot;

====Creature design====

Emmerich decided to completely reinvent Godzilla&#x27;s design because he thought the original Toho design &quot;didn&#x27;t make sense&quot;. Emmerich also discarded the previous design approved by Jan de Bont, stating, &quot;I saw the creature that they designed for [TriStar&#x27;s first attempt]. Jan De Bont created a Godzilla that was very close to the original, but it was not right because today we wouldn&#x27;t do it like that.&quot;

Patrick Tatopoulos was hired by Emmerich to design Godzilla. According to Tatopoulos, the only specific instructions Emmerich gave him was that it should be able to run incredibly fast. Godzilla, originally conceived as a robust, erect-standing, plantigrade reptilian sea monster, was reimagined by Tatopoulos as a lean, digitigrade bipedal iguana-like creature that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground. Godzilla&#x27;s color scheme was designed to reflect and blend in with the urban environment. At one point, it was planned to use motion capture from a human to create the movements of the computer-generated Godzilla, but it ended up looking too much like a human in a suit.

Tatopoulos thought the designs that Ricardo Delgado, Crash McCreery and Joey Orosco provided for Jan de Bont took the design in a wrong approach, stating, &quot;What they did which was a mistake in my mind was, rather than going in a new direction they tried to alter and make the old one better. And when you do that, first of all I think it&#x27;s very disrespectful. It&#x27;s more disrespectful for me to alter something existing than to take a fresh new direction.&quot; Tatopoulos took inspiration from the design of Shere Khan used in Disney&#x27;s version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; in terms of Godzilla&#x27;s chin, stating, &quot;One of the inspirations was a character I loved as a kid, the tiger in Jungle Book, Shere Khan. He had this great chin thing and I always loved it; he looked scary, evil but you respected him. I thought, let&#x27;s try to give him a chin and I felt it still looked realistic but he had this different thing that you hadn&#x27;t seen before.&quot;

Tatopoulos created four concept art pieces and a 2-foot tall maquette for a meeting with Toho. Tatopoulos and Emmerich attended the meeting to pitch their Godzilla to then Toho chairman Isao Matsuoka, &quot;Godzilla&quot; film producer Shogo Tomiyama, and Godzilla special effects director Koichi Kawakita. They unveiled Tatopoulos&#x27; artwork and maquette and the Toho trio remained silent for a few minutes, Emmerich recalled, &quot;They were speechless, they stared at it, and there was silence for a couple minutes, and then they said, &#x27;Could you come back tomorrow?&#x27; I thought for sure we didn&#x27;t have the movie then.&quot; Tomiyama later recalled that &quot;It was so different we realized we couldn&#x27;t make small adjustments. That left the major question of whether to approve it or not.&quot; Even though Tomiyama was not allowed to remove the artwork and maquette from the studio premise, Tomiyama visited &quot;Godzilla&quot; producer and creator Tomoyuki Tanaka, whose failing health prevented him from attending the meeting, to explain Tatopoulos&#x27; design, stating, &quot;I told him, &#x27;It&#x27;s similar to Carl Lewis, with long legs, and it runs fast&#x27;.&quot; The following morning, Matsuoka approved the design, stating that Tatopoulos &quot;kept the spirit of Godzilla.&quot;

====Writing====
Despite receiving approval from Toho, TriStar had yet to green-light the film. Emmerich and Devlin wrote the script on spec, with the condition that the screenplay would return to the filmmakers if the studio did not immediately approve it. Emmerich and Devlin wrote the first draft in five and a half weeks at Emmerich&#x27;s vacation house in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Emmerich and Devlin decided to abandon the Atlantis origin established in Elliott and Rossio&#x27;s script in favor of the radiation origin established in the Toho films, Devlin stated, &quot;In some of the early drafts of the script by others, they had Godzilla being an alien planted here. What Japan had originally come up with regarding nuclear radiation – you can&#x27;t abandon that. It&#x27;s too important to what Godzilla is all about.&quot; Emmerich and Devlin also decided to treat their Godzilla more animal-like than monstrous, Tatopoulos stated, &quot;We were creating an animal. We weren&#x27;t creating a monster.&quot; Emmerich and Devlin also decided to give their Godzilla the ability to burrow underground, Devlin stated, &quot;We discovered that certain kinds of lizards can burrow, so we decided to give him that capability.&quot; Chameleon-like skin change was also considered but abandoned later during production.

Emmerich and Devlin also abandoned Godzilla&#x27;s iconic atomic breath in favor of a &quot;power breath&quot;, where their Godzilla would simply blow objects away by exhaling a strong wind-like breath. However, news of the power breath leaked before the film&#x27;s release, which outraged fans and forced Emmerich and Devlin to make last minute changes on scenes involving the power breath, effects supervisor Volker Engel stated, &quot;Dean and Roland wanted this monster to retain a certain menace and credibility, but Godzilla&#x27;s breath is something everyone expects to see at some point, so they came up with instances in which you would see something like the old breath, but with a kind of logic applied to it. We make the assumption that something in his breath, when it comes in contact with flame, causes combustive ignition. So you get this flame-thrower effect, which causes everything to ignite.&quot; As a way to make their Godzilla a threat to mankind, Emmerich and Devlin also gave their Godzilla the ability to lay hundreds of eggs (via parthenogenesis) and rapidly spawn offspring that could spawn offspring of their own and quickly overrun the planet. The first draft was submitted to Sony on December 19, 1996, then-President of Sony Pictures John Calley forwarded the script to Bob Levin of marketing to brainstorm marketing ideas.

====Pre-production====
TriStar green-lit the film soon after Emmerich and Devlin&#x27;s completion of the first draft, bestowing complete creative freedom to write, produce, and direct on the filmmakers, while the studio managed financing, distribution and merchandising deals. The deal also enabled Emmerich and Devlin to receive 15% first-dollar gross on the film while the original producers Cary Woods and Robert Fried would be given executive producer credits. Instead of employing Digital Domain as Jan de Bont planned for his Godzilla, Emmerich and Devlin decided to use their own effects team such as Volker Engel as the film&#x27;s visual effects supervisor, Joe Viskocil as miniature effects supervisor, Clay Pinney as mechanical effects supervisor, and William Fay as executive producer of the team.

Viewpoint DataLabs created a digital model of Godzilla, nicknamed &quot;Fred&quot;, for scenes that required a digital rendition of the monster. For scenes that required practical effects, Tatopoulos&#x27; studio created a 6th-scale animatronic model of Godzilla&#x27;s upper-body as well as a 24th-scale Godzilla suit donned by stuntman Kurt Carley. The filmmakers favored CG over practical effects and as a result, the final film features 400 digital shots, 185 of which feature Godzilla, and only two dozen practical effects used in the final film.

====Filming====
Principal photography began on May 1, 1997 and wrapped on September 26, 1997. Filming took place in New York City and moved to Los Angeles in June. Scenes in New York were filmed in 13 days; tropical scenes were filmed in the Hawaiian Islands. The United States Marine Corps participated in the filming of the movie. An F-18 Marine Reserve pilot, Col. Dwight Schmidt, actually piloted the plane that &quot;fired&quot; the missiles that killed Godzilla.

==Music==

The soundtrack, featuring alternative rock music, was released on May 19, 1998, by Epic Records. It was a success on the music charts, peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum on June 22, 1998. The original score was composed by David Arnold. The film&#x27;s score was not released on CD until 9 years later, when it went on sale as a complete original film score in 2007 by La La Land Records. The album was supported by the single &quot;Come with Me&quot; performed by Sean Combs and Jimmy Page.

==Release==
===Marketing===
Bob Levin, chief of marketing for the film, was caught by surprise when Emmerich insisted not to use full body images or head shots of Godzilla during the marketing, Levin stated, &quot;we got indications from them that they really didn&#x27;t think that the full figure Godzilla should be at all exposed prior to the release of the film. While initially we reacted negatively to that, once we understood their thinking behind it, it became completely acceptable to us.&quot; 300 companies signed an agreement not to show the full image of Godzilla before the film&#x27;s release. Prior to principal photography, Emmerich filmed a teaser trailer, budgeted at $600,000, that featured Godzilla&#x27;s foot crushing the skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex at a museum. The trailer was attached to screenings of &quot;Men in Black&quot; and received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from audiences. Afterwards, select theaters began advertising that the trailer would be featured before &quot;Men in Black&quot;. A new trailer later premiered on November 7, 1997, with the release of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.

Taco Bell contributed to the marketing of the film with $20 million in media support. The marketing campaign featured commercials of the Taco Bell chihuahua attempting to trap the monster in a box or riding on the monster&#x27;s tail and making an order for two. Trendmasters manufactured the toys for the film, including the 11-inch tall &quot;Living Godzilla&quot; and the 21-inch tall &quot;Ultimate Godzilla&quot;. However, poor merchandise sales for the film led to a cancellation of a toyline based on the animated series. Robert Fried had estimated that $80 million was spent on marketing worldwide.

===Home media===
On November 3, 1998, the film was released on VHS and DVD in the United States. Special features for the DVD include: photo galleries, visual effects and special FX supervisor commentaries, the music video for &quot;Heroes&quot; by The Wallflowers, Behind the Scenes of &quot;Godzilla&quot; with Charles Caiman, theatrical trailers, a featurette, director/producer and cast biographies, a photo gallery, music video, and Godzilla Takes New York (before and after shots). In 1999, Sony released a Widescreen Edition VHS. The VHS earned from rentals during its first week in the United States, at the time making it the biggest video opening since &quot;Titanic&quot;. The DVD sold over 400,000 units in the United States by the end of 1998. It was also reported that NBC would pay around for the television broadcast rights in the United States.

On December 13, 2005, the film was released on Universal Media Disc. On March 28, 2006, Sony released a special &quot;monster&quot; edition DVD that retained the previous DVD&#x27;s special features, as well as an &quot;All-Time Best of Godzilla Fight Scenes&quot; featurette, 3 episodes from &quot;&quot;, and a &quot;never-before-seen&quot; production art gallery. On November 10, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray, which retained the special features from the second DVD release, sans the animated series episodes. On July 16, 2013, Sony released a &quot;Mastered in 4K&quot; Blu-ray edition. On May 14, 2019, the film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray. This release retained the same special features from the initial Blu-ray release, as well as a new Dolby Atmos audio mix.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The Wall Street Journal reported that the film would need to gross $240 million domestically in order to be considered a success. &quot;Godzilla&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 1998, in a record 3,310 theaters. Sony expected the film to gross $100 million during the film&#x27;s opening weekend, which fell on Memorial Day weekend, expecting to set a new record for the holiday. Ultimately, it would only end up earning $12.5 million on opening day and grossing $44 million during its opening weekend. The film grossed $55,726,951 over the four day holiday weekend, and in its first six days, falling below industry expectations. Its six-day opening gross nevertheless came close to the Memorial Day weekend record previously set by &quot;&quot; in 1996, but fell below the record set by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; in 1997.

The film&#x27;s revenue dropped by 59% in its second week of release, earning $18,020,444. For that particular weekend, the film remained in first place as the romantic drama &quot;Hope Floats&quot; overtook &quot;Deep Impact&quot; for second place with $14,210,464 in box office business. During its final week in North America, the film was in 19th place, grossing $202,157. For that weekend, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; made its debut, opening in first place with $34,048,124 in revenue. The film went on to top out domestically at $136,314,294 in total ticket sales through an eight-week theatrical run (equivalent to $230 million adjusted for ticket inflation in 2013).

Internationally, the film took in an additional in business, for a combined worldwide total of $379,014,294 (equivalent to adjusted for ticket inflation in 2013). For 1998 as a whole, the film was the ninth highest-grossing film domestically and the third highest-grossing film worldwide. Despite performing below expectations domestically, &quot;Godzilla&quot; was a profitable worldwide success, grossing nearly three times its budget. Sony stated that retail sales of consumer products generated $400 million; not only from the 1998 film but from the animated series and the Heisei Godzilla films that Sony acquired at the time.

===Critical response===
&quot;Godzilla&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 20% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 4.50/10. Its critical consensus states, &quot;Without compelling characters or heart, &quot;Godzilla&quot; stomps on everything that made the original (or any monster movie worth its salt) a classic.&quot; Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned &quot;Godzilla&quot; a score of 32 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A to F. Criticism highlighted by film critics included the film&#x27;s script, acting, and directing, while fans targeted the film&#x27;s reinvention of Godzilla, which included its redesign and departure from the source material.

Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, noting that &quot;One must carefully repress intelligent thought while watching such a film. The movie makes no sense at all except as a careless pastiche of its betters (and, yes, the Japanese &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies are, in their way, better—if only because they embrace dreck instead of condescending to it). You have to absorb such a film, not consider it. But my brain rebelled, and insisted on applying logic where it was not welcome.&quot; Ebert also pointed out in his review that the characters Mayor Ebert and his assistant Gene were Devlin and Emmerich&#x27;s jabs at his and Gene Siskel&#x27;s negative reviews of &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Gene Siskel particularly singled out this aspect, writing &quot;why place us in the movie if you aren&#x27;t going to have us be eaten or squashed by the monster?&quot; Siskel placed the film on his list of the worst films of 1998. James Berardinelli from ReelViews, called the film &quot;one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time, it&#x27;s like spitting into the wind. Emmerich and Devlin are master illusionists, waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors. It&#x27;s probably too much to hope that some day, movie-goers will wake up and realize that they&#x27;ve been had.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is so clumsily structured it feels as if it&#x27;s two different movies stuck together with an absurd stomping finale glued onto the end. The only question worth asking about this $120 million wad of popcorn is a commercial one. How much further will the dumbing down of the event movie have to go before the audience stops buying tickets?&quot;

Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; queried, &quot;The question is this: Are the awe-inspiring creature effects and roaring battle scenes impressive enough to make you forget the stupid story, inaccurate science and basic implausibility?&quot; Thoughtfully disillusioned, he wrote, &quot;The cut-rate cast seems to have been plucked from the pages of &quot;TV Guide&quot;. There&#x27;s Doug Savant from &quot;Melrose Place&quot; as O&#x27;Neal, a scaredy-cat military man who looks like Sgt. Rock and acts like Barney Fife. There&#x27;s Maria Pitillo (&quot;House Rules&quot;) as Nick&#x27;s soporific love interest, Audrey; &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer as a wise-cracking news cameraman and superficial reporter; Vicki Lewis of &quot;NewsRadio&quot; as a lusty scientist. Shall I continue?&quot; Owen Gleiberman writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought &quot;There&#x27;s no resonance to the new &quot;Godzilla&quot;, and no built-in cheese value, either. For a while, the filmmakers honor the sentimental paradox that seeped into the later &quot;Godzilla&quot; films: that this primitive destroyer, like &quot;King Kong&quot;, doesn&#x27;t actually mean any harm.&quot; He opined that the film contained &quot;some clever and exciting sequences&quot;, but ultimately came to the conclusion that, &quot;It says much about today&#x27;s blockbuster filmmakers that they could spend so much money on &quot;Godzilla&quot; and still fail to do justice to something that was fairy-tale destructo schlock to begin with.&quot;

===Response from crew===
Emmerich later admitted regretting the film&#x27;s production, particularly due to the rushed shooting schedule that was required for a Memorial Day weekend release and the studio&#x27;s insistence on not test-screening the film. However, he defended the film as better than critics gave it credit for, as it was financially successful, and out of all the films he directed, it was the one which parents told him their children enjoyed the most. Emmerich also conceded that he never took the Toho films seriously, stating, &quot;I was never a big Godzilla fan, they were just the weekend matinees you saw as a kid, like Hercules films and the really bad Italian westerns. You&#x27;d go with all your friends and just laugh.&quot;

In later years, Devlin stated that he &quot;screwed up&quot; his Godzilla, mainly blaming the script that he co-wrote with Emmerich as the source of the film&#x27;s failure. Devlin additionally emphasized &quot;two flaws&quot; that he believed hurt the film, stating, &quot;The first is we did not commit to anthropomorphizing Godzilla – meaning we did not decide if he was a heroic character, or a villainous character. We made the intellectual decision to have him be neither and just simply an animal trying to survive.&quot; Devlin said the decision was a &quot;big mistake&quot; and revealed the second flaw of the film was &quot;...deciding to exposit the characters&#x27; background in the middle of the film rather than in the first act (where we always do). At the time we told the audience who these characters were, they had already made their minds up about them and we could not change that perception&quot;. Devlin concluded by stating, &quot;These were 2 serious mistakes in the writing of the film, and I take full responsibility.&quot;

During a 2016 interview on &quot;Gilbert Gottfried&#x27;s Amazing Colossal Podcast!&quot;, Broderick maintained that he liked the film. Apart from suggesting he may have been miscast, he admitted to failing to understand the film&#x27;s poor reputation, given that it made &quot;a lot of money&quot; and was the result of a large group of people&#x27;s hard work. He also described Roland Emmerich as &quot;a very good friend.&quot;

Rob Fried, who helped acquire the rights for TriStar, was angered how the studio handled the property, stating, &quot;The Sony executive team that took over &quot;Godzilla&quot; was one of the worst cases of executive incompetence I have observed in my twenty-year career. One of the golden assets of our time, which was hand-delivered to them, was managed as poorly and ineptly as anybody can manage an asset. They took a jewel and turned it into dust.&quot;

In 2018, Azaria expressed his disappointment with working on &quot;Godzilla&quot;, citing its failure to boost his career profile as intended, and noting that he fell sick several times while shooting in rainy exteriors for five months. He went on to declare that &quot;Godzilla&quot; became the &quot;poster child&quot; for everything wrong with Hollywood in terms of budget and marketing, adding that the advertisements looked better than the film itself.

===Response from Toho===
Veteran &quot;Godzilla&quot; actors Haruo Nakajima and Kenpachiro Satsuma, as well as Shusuke Kaneko (who would later direct &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;), were also critical of the film and its character. Nakajima stated &quot;its face looks like an iguana and its body and limbs look like a frog&quot;. Satsuma walked out of a screening of the film at fan convention G-Con &#x27;98 in Chicago, stating, &quot;it&#x27;s not Godzilla, it doesn&#x27;t have his spirit&quot;. Toho publicist Yosuke Ogura later called TriStar&#x27;s design a &quot;disaster.&quot; TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla was considered so different that the term &quot;GINO&quot; (&quot;Godzilla In Name Only&quot;) was coined by critic and Godzilla fan Richard Pusateri to distinguish the character apart from Toho&#x27;s Godzilla.

Kaneko pondered on the treatment the character was given by the studio, stating, &quot;It is interesting [that] the US version of Godzilla runs about trying to escape missiles... Americans seem unable to accept a creature that cannot be put down by their arms.&quot; In 2004, Toho began trademarking future incarnations of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla as &quot;Zilla&quot; for future appearances. This decision was made by producer Shōgo Tomiyama and &quot;&quot; director Ryuhei Kitamura because they felt Emmerich&#x27;s film &quot;took the God out of Godzilla&quot; by portraying the character like a mere animal. The name &quot;Zilla&quot; was chosen for the character by Tomiyama as a satirical take on counterfeit Godzilla products that use &quot;Zilla&quot; as a suffix. The character has since appeared in other media as &quot;Zilla&quot;. Nicholas Raymond from Screen Rant described Toho&#x27;s subsequent treatment of TriStar&#x27;s Godzilla as &quot;a clear sign that Toho doesn&#x27;t regard the 1998 Godzilla as the King of the Monsters. It would appear that to them, he&#x27;s just a giant lizard.&quot;

In 2024, filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki, director and writer of Toho&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;, spoke favorably of the 1998 film. He felt that on its own merits, the 1998 film is &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;quite well executed&quot; and was technologically a huge achievement but understood why some are adamant to consider it not part of the Godzilla pantheon. Yamazaki also refuted the misconception that the 1998 film was allegedly responsible for the franchise&#x27;s box office decline in Japan, stating &quot;it had been in decline for years&quot; by the time that the 1998 film was released.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated and won several awards in 1998–99. Furthermore, it was screened out of competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Godzilla&quot; would later rank in the listed bottom 20 of the Stinkers&#x27; &quot;100 Years, 100 Stinkers&quot; list, which noted the 100 worst movies of the 20th century, at #18.

==Post-release==
===Cancelled trilogy===
TriStar planned to produce a &quot;Godzilla&quot; trilogy upon acquiring the Godzilla license in 1992. Emmerich had considered using the Monster Island concept from the Toho films with the intention of creating something wild, as well as including six or seven monsters, stating, &quot;We&#x27;ll probably come up with other monsters because we don&#x27;t want to tie ourselves too much to certain things&quot;. Prior to the 1998 film&#x27;s release, Sony felt confident enough with the potential box office success that they paid Toho $5 million for sequel rights, which guaranteed them to produce a sequel within five years following the first film&#x27;s release, so long as it was in active development. Devlin had confirmed plans for a trilogy, stating, &quot;We have a Godzilla trilogy in mind. The second one is remarkably different from the first one, and if it&#x27;s embraced, a third one would make a whole lot of sense. I don&#x27;t see us doing more than three, but I would love to finish out telling the story.&quot;

Emmerich and Devlin commissioned a treatment by Tab Murphy titled &quot;Godzilla 2&quot;. The sequel would have involved the surviving offspring battling a giant insect in Sydney. The studio abandoned sequel plans due to a lack of enthusiasm from fans, audiences, theater owners and licensees, and Emmerich and Devlin left due to budget disputes. Devlin stated, &quot;They wanted to tailor it budget-wise, so it didn&#x27;t make sense for us creatively.&quot; Devlin stated that they left the film with an open-ending in case the success allowed them to return for sequels. Despite Emmerich&#x27;s comments that Sony was &quot;absolutely ready&quot; to produce a sequel, he later revealed that he advised the studio to not produce a sequel, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s so strange because people expected it to be the biggest thing ever, then it only did well. They are disappointed, and you have to defend yourself&quot;. Sony had considered a reboot with the new series disassociating itself from the 1998 film. However, TriStar let their remake/sequel rights expire on May 20, 2003.

===Animated series===

An animated series was produced as a sequel and aired on Fox Kids from 1998 to 2000. In the series, Dr. Tatopoulos accidentally discovers the egg that survived the aerial bombardment before it hatches, in a minor change from the ending in the 1998 film. The creature hatches after Nick Tatopoulos stumbles onto it and it assumes him to be its parent. Subsequently, Dr. Tatopoulos and his associates form a research team, investigating strange occurrences and defending mankind from dangerous mutations with the new Godzilla, which grew to full size in a few days, serving as humanity&#x27;s protector from the new threats.

===Reboots===

In 1999, Toho rebooted the Japanese series with &quot;Godzilla 2000&quot;, launching the franchise&#x27;s Millennium series. Toho originally planned to revive the series in 2005 to commemorate the franchise&#x27;s 50th anniversary. However, Toho chose to revive the series early due to popular demand, producer Shogo Tomiyama stated, &quot;The shape of the American version of Godzilla was so different from the Japanese version that there was a clamor among fans and company officials to create a Godzilla unique to Japan.&quot;

In 2014, Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures released their own Hollywood reboot of the same name. Producer Thomas Tull was adamant about keeping their Godzilla design consistent with the Toho version and expressed puzzlement as to why the crew behind TriStar&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; drastically changed the design to the point that it was &quot;unrecognizable.&quot; The film generated its own sequels, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; and &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot;, creating a cinematic universe media franchise titled the MonsterVerse.

<text>Sonja Denise Plack (&#x27;Williams), known professionally asSonja Sohn&quot;&#x27;, is an American actress, filmmaker, and activist, best known for portraying Baltimore detective Kima Greggs in the HBO drama &quot;The Wire&quot; (2002–2008). She is also known for having starred in the 1998 independent film &quot;Slam&quot;, which she co-wrote, and appearing as Samantha Baker in the ABC series &quot;Body of Proof&quot;. She is also the founder and CEO of the Baltimore-based outreach program, reWIRED for Change, which focuses on the rehabilitation of at-risk youth who have engaged in criminal behavior.

==Early life and education ==
Sohn was born Sonja Denise Williams in Fort Benning, Georgia. Her mother was Korean and her father was Black. Her parents met when her father was stationed in South Korea after the Korean War.

She attended and graduated from Warwick High School in Newport News, Virginia.

==Career==
Williams became professionally known as Sonja Sohn. Before she was an actress, Sohn was a slam poet. While performing her work on stage, she was spotted by Marc Levin who offered her a role in his film &quot;Slam&quot;. She also wrote lyrics and co-wrote the script for the film. It went on to win the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Film at the Sundance Film Festival. After debuting in &quot;Slam&quot;, Sohn appeared in minor roles in films such as &quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot;. She also starred in independent films &quot;Perfume&quot;, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;The Killing Zone&quot;.

Through the five seasons of the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot;, she held a starring role as Detective Kima Greggs.
She struggled during the first season of &quot;The Wire&quot; and considered quitting as she had trouble recalling her lines. She also guest-starred on many episodes of &quot;Cold Case&quot; as &quot;Toni Halstead&quot;. She won the supporting television actress award at the 2008 Asian Excellence Awards for her character on &quot;The Wire&quot;.

She had a supporting role in the Hollywood film &quot;Step Up 2: The Streets&quot;. In 2008-09, she was a guest star in the ABC series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, and in 2010 she appeared in an episode of CBS series &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. In 2011, she was a guest star on the show &quot;Bar Karma&quot;. She played Detective Samantha Baker in the first two seasons of the medical drama television series &quot;Body of Proof&quot; with Dana Delany and Jeri Ryan, which premiered on ABC on March 29, 2011.

Sohn joined season 2 of &quot;The Originals&quot; in a recurring role as the witch Lenore a.k.a. Esther Mikaelson.

Sohn made her directorial debut with the 2017 HBO documentary &quot;Baltimore Rising&quot; about the 2015 Baltimore protests and community organizing that arose in response to police violence. In 2021, Sohn directed &quot;The Slow Hustle,&quot; a documentary about the death of Baltimore Homicide Detective Sean Suiter, which was fictionally portrayed in the HBO miniseries &quot;We Own This City.&quot;

Sohn appeared in ABC&#x27;s police drama &quot;Will Trent&quot; as Amanda, the head of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and Trent&#x27;s (Ramón Rodríguez) boss. The pilot episode aired January 3, 2023.

==Activism==
Previously involved in political activism (she campaigned in North Carolina in support of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential bid), Sohn took a break from acting in 2009 to concentrate on social issues. She is the founder and CEO of the Baltimore-based reWIRED for Change, an outreach program intended to communicate with (and ultimately rehabilitate) at-risk youth involved in criminal activity.

The program is run out of the University of Maryland School of Social Work and uses episodes of &quot;The Wire&quot; as a teaching tool, encouraging the participants to examine and query their lives and past actions. Other actors and writers involved with &quot;The Wire&quot; serve as board members.

In 2011, she was presented with the Woman of the Year award from the Harvard Black Men&#x27;s Forum.

==Personal life==
Sohn has two daughters, Sophia and Sakira. In 2003, Sohn married didgeridoo player Adam Plack. , Sohn and Plack are divorced.

On July 21, 2019, Sohn was arrested in North Carolina and charged with felony possession of cocaine.

<text>Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, previously called the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer, is a NASA three-telescope space observatory for studying gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and monitoring the afterglow in X-ray, and UV/visible light at the location of a burst. It was launched on 20 November 2004, aboard a Delta II launch vehicle. Headed by principal investigator Neil Gehrels until his death in February 2017, the mission was developed in a joint partnership between Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and an international consortium from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. The mission is operated by Pennsylvania State University as part of NASA&#x27;s Medium Explorer program (MIDEX).

The burst detection rate is 100 per year, with a sensitivity ~3 times fainter than the BATSE detector aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The Swift mission was launched with a nominal on-orbit lifetime of two years. Swift is a NASA MIDEX (medium-class Explorer) mission. It was the third to be launched, following IMAGE and WMAP.

While originally designed for the study of gamma-ray bursts, Swift now functions as a general-purpose multi-wavelength observatory, particularly for the rapid followup and characterization of astrophysical transients of all types. As of 2020, Swift received 5.5 Target of Opportunity observing proposals per day, and observes ~70 targets per day, on average.

== Overview ==
Swift is a multi-wavelength space observatory dedicated to the study of gamma-ray bursts. Its three instruments work together to observe GRBs and their afterglows in the gamma-ray, X-ray, ultraviolet, and optical wavebands.

Based on continuous scans of the area of the sky with one of the instrument&#x27;s monitors, Swift uses momentum wheels to autonomously slew into the direction of possible GRBs. The name &quot;Swift&quot; is not a mission-related acronym, but rather a reference to the instrument&#x27;s rapid slew capability, and the nimble swift (bird of the same name). All of Swift&#x27;s discoveries are transmitted to the ground and those data are available to other observatories which join Swift in observing the GRBs.

In the time between GRB events, Swift is available for other scientific investigations, and scientists from universities and other organizations can submit proposals for observations.

The Swift Mission Operation Center (MOC), where commanding of the satellite is performed, is located in State College, Pennsylvania and operated by the Pennsylvania State University and industry subcontractors. The Swift main ground station is located at the Broglio Space Center near Malindi on the coast of eastern Kenya, and is operated by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). The Swift Science Data Center (SDC) and archive are located at the Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington, D.C. The United Kingdom Swift Science Data Centre is located at the University of Leicester.

The Swift satellite bus was built by Spectrum Astro, which was later acquired by General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, which was in turn acquired by Orbital Sciences Corporation (now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems).

== Instruments ==
=== Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) ===

The BAT detects GRB events and computes its coordinates in the sky. It covers a large fraction of the sky (over one steradian fully coded, three steradians partially coded; by comparison, the full sky solid angle is 4π or about 12.6 steradians). It locates the position of each event with an accuracy of 1 to 4 arcminutes within 15 seconds. This crude position is immediately relayed to the ground, and some wide-field, rapid-slew ground-based telescopes can catch the GRB with this information. The BAT uses a coded-aperture mask of 52,000 randomly placed lead tiles, above a detector plane of 32,768 Cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) hard X-ray detector tiles; it is purpose-built for Swift. Energy range: 15–150 keV.

=== X-ray Telescope (XRT) ===

The XRT can take images and perform spectral analysis of the GRB afterglow. This provides more precise location of the GRB, with a typical error circle of approximately 2 arcseconds radius. The XRT is also used to perform long-term monitoring of GRB afterglow light-curves for days to weeks after the event, depending on the brightness of the afterglow. The XRT uses a Wolter Type I X-ray telescope with 12 nested mirrors, focused onto a single MOS charge-coupled device (CCD) similar to those used by the XMM-Newton EPIC MOS cameras. On-board software allows fully automated observations, with the instrument selecting an appropriate observing mode for each object, based on its measured count rate. The telescope has an energy range of 0.2–10 keV.

=== Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) ===
After Swift has slewed towards a GRB, the UVOT is used to detect an optical afterglow. The UVOT provides a sub-arcsecond position and provides optical and ultra-violet photometry through lenticular filters and low resolution spectra (170–650 nm) through the use of its optical and UV grisms. The UVOT is also used to provide long-term follow-ups of GRB afterglow lightcurves. The UVOT is based on the XMM-Newton&#x27;s Optical Monitor (OM) instrument, with improved optics and upgraded onboard processing computers.

On 9 November 2011, UVOT photographed the asteroid 2005 YU55 as the asteroid made a close flyby of the Earth.

On 3 June 2013, UVOT unveiled a massive ultraviolet survey of the nearby Magellanic Clouds.

In August 2017, UVOT imaged UV emissions from gravitational wave event GW170817 detected by LIGO &amp; Virgo detectors.

== Experiments ==

=== Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) ===
BAT (Burst Alert Telescope) is a gamma ray telescope, built by NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center, uses a coded aperture to locate the source. The software to locate the source is provided by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The CdZnTe detector of area, consisting of 32,500 units of , can pin-point the location of sources within 1.4 arcminutes. The energy range is 15-150 keV.

=== Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) ===
UVOT (Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope) monitors the afterglow in ultraviolet and visible light, and locates the source at an accuracy of one arcsecond. Its aperture is , with an f-number equal to 12.7, and is backed by 2048 x 2048 photon counting CCD pixels. The source location accuracy is better than one arcsecond.

=== X-Ray Telescope (XRT) ===
XRT (X-Ray Telescope) aims at the source more accurately, and monitors the afterglow in X-rays. It was built jointly by the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), the Brera Astronomical Observatory, Italy, and the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. It has a detector of area consisting of 600 x 600 pixels, and covers the energy range of 0.2-10 keV. It can locate the afterglow source at an accuracy of four arcseconds.

== Mission goals ==
The Swift mission has four key scientific objectives:
* To determine the origin of GRBs. There seem to be at least two types of GRBs, only one of which can be explained with a hypernova, creating a gamma-ray beam. More data is needed to explore other explanations
* To use GRBs to expand understanding of the young universe. GRBs seem to take place at &quot;cosmological distances&quot; of many millions or billions of light-years, which means they can be used to probe the distant, and therefore young, cosmos
* To conduct an all-sky survey which will be more sensitive than any previous one, and will add significantly to scientific knowledge of astronomical X-ray sources. Thus, it could also yield unexpected results
* To serve as a general purpose gamma-ray/X-ray/optical observatory platform, performing rapid &quot;target of opportunity&quot; observations of many transient astrophysical phenomena, such as supernova

== Mission history ==
Swift was launched on 20 November 2004, at 17:16:01 UTC aboard a Delta II 7320-10C from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and reached a near-perfect orbit of altitude, with an inclination of 20.60°.

On 4 December 2004, an anomaly occurred during instrument activation when the Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) Power Supply for the X-Ray Telescope did not turn on as expected. The XRT Team at University of Leicester and Pennsylvania State University were able to determine on 8 December 2004 that the XRT would be usable even without the TEC being operational. Additional testing on 16 December 2004 did not yield any further information as to the cause of the anomaly.

On 17 December 2004 at 07:28:30 UTC, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and located on board an apparent gamma-ray burst during launch and early operations. The spacecraft did not autonomously slew to the burst since normal operation had not yet begun, and autonomous slewing was not yet enabled. Swift had its first GRB trigger during a period when the autonomous slewing was enabled on 17 January 2005, at about 12:55 UTC. It pointed the XRT telescope to the on-board computed coordinates and observed a bright X-ray source in the field of view.

On 1 February 2005, the mission team released the first light picture of the UVOT instrument and declared Swift operational.

By May 2010, Swift had detected more than 500 GRBs.

By October 2013, Swift had detected more than 800 GRBs.

On 27 October 2015, Swift detected its 1,000th GRB, an event named GRB 151027B and located in the constellation Eridanus.

On 10 January 2018, NASA announced that the Swift spacecraft had been renamed the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in honor of mission PI Neil Gehrels, who died in early 2017.

Swift entered safe mode on March 15, 2024 (after the 2nd of 4 gyroscopes failed) and was not conducting science. A software patch for two-gyroscope mode was developed, uplinked and tested in April 2024, and Swift returned to nominal operations at that point.

== Notable detections ==

* 9 May 2005: Swift detected GRB 050509B, a burst of gamma rays that lasted one-twentieth of a second. The detection marked the first time that the accurate location of a short-duration gamma-ray burst had been identified and the first detection of X-ray afterglow in an individual short burst.
* 4 September 2005: Swift detected GRB 050904 with a redshift value of 6.29 and a duration of 200 seconds (most of the detected bursts last about 10 seconds). It was also found to be the most distant yet detected, at approximately 12.6 billion light-years.
* 18 February 2006: Swift detected GRB 060218, an unusually long (about 2000 seconds) and nearby (about 440 million light-years) burst, which was unusually dim despite its close distance, and may be an indication of an imminent supernova.
* 14 June 2006: Swift detected GRB 060614, a burst of gamma rays that lasted 102 seconds in a distant galaxy (about 1.6 billion light-years). No supernova was seen following this event (and GRB 060505 to deep limits) leading some to speculate that it represented a new class of progenitors. Others suggested that these events could have been massive star deaths, but ones which produced too little radioactive 56Ni to power a supernova explosion.
* 9 January 2008: Swift was observing a supernova in NGC 2770 when it witnessed an X-ray burst coming from the same galaxy. The source of this burst was found to be the beginning of another supernova, later called SN 2008D. Never before had a supernova been seen at such an early stage in its evolution. Following this stroke of luck (position, time, most appropriate instruments), astronomers were able to study in detail this Type Ibc supernova with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Very Large Array in New Mexico, the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii, Gemini South in Chile, the Keck I telescope in Hawaii, the PAIRITEL telescope at Mount Hopkins, the 200-inch and telescopes at the Palomar Observatory in California, and the telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. The significance of this supernova was likened by discovery team leader Alicia Soderberg to that of the Rosetta Stone for egyptology.
* 8 and 13 February 2008: Swift provided critical information about the nature of Hanny&#x27;s Voorwerp, mainly the absence of an ionizing source within the Voorwerp or in the neighboring IC 2497.
* 19 March 2008: Swift detected GRB 080319B, a burst of gamma rays amongst the brightest celestial objects ever witnessed. At 7.5 billion light-years, &quot;Swift&quot; established a new record for the farthest object (briefly) visible to the naked eye. It was also said to be 2.5 million times intrinsically brighter than the previous brightest accepted supernova (SN 2005ap). &quot;Swift&quot; observed a record four GRBs that day, which also coincided with the death of noted science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.
* 13 September 2008: Swift detected GRB 080913, at the time the most distant GRB observed (12.8 billion light-years) until the observation of GRB 090423 a few months later.
* 23 April 2009: Swift detected GRB 090423, the most distant cosmic explosion ever seen at that time, at 13.035 billion light-years. In other words, the universe was only 630 million years old when this burst occurred.
* 29 April 2009: Swift detected GRB 090429B, which was found by later analysis published in 2011 to be 13.14 billion light-years distant (approximately equivalent to 520 million years after the Big Bang), even farther than GRB 090423.
* 16 March 2010: Swift tied its record by again detecting and localizing four bursts in a single day.
* 13 April 2010: Swift detected its 500th GRB.
* 28 March 2011: Swift detected Swift J1644+57 which subsequent analysis showed to possibly be the signature of a star being disrupted by a black hole or the ignition of an active galactic nucleus. &quot;This is truly different from any explosive event we have seen before&quot;, said Joshua Bloom of the University of California, Berkeley, the lead author of the study published in the June issue of &quot;Science&quot;.
* 16 and 17 September 2012: BAT triggered two times on a previously unknown hard X-ray source, named Sw J1745-26, a few degrees from the Galactic Center. The outburst, produced by a rare X-ray nova, announced the presence of a previously unknown stellar-mass black hole undergoing a dramatic transition from the low/hard to the high/soft state.
* 2013: Discovery of ultra-long class of gamma-ray bursts
* 24 April 2013: Swift detected an X-ray flare from the Galactic Center. This proved not to be related to Sgr A* but to a previously unsuspected magnetar. Later observations by the NuSTAR and the Chandra X-ray Observatory confirmed the detection.
* 27 April 2013: Swift detected the &quot;shockingly bright&quot; Gamma-ray burst GRB 130427A. Observed simultaneously by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, it is one of the five closest GRBs detected and one of the brightest seen by either space telescope.
* 3 June 2013: Evidence for kilonova emission in short GRB
* 23 April 2014: Swift detected the strongest, hottest, and longest-lasting sequence of stellar flares ever seen from a nearby red dwarf star. The initial blast from this record-setting series of explosions was as much as 10,000 times more powerful than the largest solar flare ever recorded.
* 3 May 2014: Detection of a UV Pulse from an iPTF discovered young Type Ia SN
* June–July 2015: The brown dwarf OGLE-2015-BLG-1319 was discovered using the gravitational microlensing detection method in a joint effort between Swift, Spitzer Space Telescope, and the ground-based Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, the first time two space telescopes have observed the same microlensing event. This method was possible because of the large separation between the two spacecraft: Swift is in low Earth orbit while Spitzer is more than one AU distant in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. This separation provided significantly different perspectives of the brown dwarf, allowing for constraints to be placed on some of the object&#x27;s physical characteristics.
* 27 October 2015: Swift detected its 1000th gamma-ray burst, GRB 151027B.
* 18 August 2017: Swift discovers UV emission from the kilonova AT 2017gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to GW170817.
* 23 September 2017: Swift is the first to identify as the possible source of the IceCube-170922A extremely high energy (EHE) neutrinos.
* 14 January 2019: Swift discovers the most powerful observed gamma-ray burst, GRB 190114C, reaching teraelectronvolt energies.
* 09 October 2022: Swift discovers, simultaneously with Fermi, GRB 221009A, one of the closest GRBs ever detected and the brightest ever detected.

<text>was the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Suō Province and the head of the Ōuchi clan, succeeding Ōuchi Yoshioki.

In 1522, he fought the Amago clan along with his father, Yoshioki, to win the control of Aki Province. Upon Yoshioki&#x27;s death in 1528, Yoshitaka became the head of Ōuchi clan. In the 1530s, he led military actions in the northern Kyūshū, defeating Shōni clan to win control of the area. With his back then secure, in 1540 he again started combating the Amago clan and by 1541, managed to completely control the Aki province.

However, in 1542, an invasion into Izumo Province ended in a disaster, with Yoshitaka losing his adopted son Ōuchi Harumochi along with large number of troops against Amago Haruhisa. His 1542–43 Siege of Toda Castle ended in failure. He completely lost his ambitions of expanding his domains and devoted his energy to the arts and culture. His retainers split into two factions. Those led by Sagara Taketō wanted the Ōuchi clan to simply do nothing more than maintain the control of their current domains, while those led by Sue Harukata wanted to continue expanding. Yoshitaka sided with the former.

Under the patronage of Yoshitaka, foreign trade and the arts flourished, and the Ōuchi home city Yamaguchi prospered greatly. In addition, Yoshitaka also attracted the Portuguese missionary Francis Xavier, and allowed him to proselytize while he was in Yamaguchi. At the same time, Yoshitaka fostered a close relationship with Emperor Go-Nara in Kyoto, and sponsored many imperial rites that the imperial court could not have afforded otherwise. On March 27, 1551, the embattled emperor appointed Ōuchi Yoshitaka as Acting Governor of Yamashiro (山城権守), the home province where the imperial capital Kyoto was located, in a bid to leverage the Ōuchi against the ravages of the warlord Miyoshi Nagayoshi, who occupied the capital. Yoshitaka, as Acting Governor of Yamashiro and, by extension, the protector of the court, embarked on a daring plan to relocate the emperor and the court to Yamaguchi. High-ranking courtiers and performers of imperial rites moved to Yamaguchi, including dignitaries such as former regent (&quot;kampaku&quot;) Nijō Tadafusa and retired Grand Minister (&quot;Sadaijin&quot;) Sanjō Kin&#x27;yori (三条公頼; father-in-law of Takeda Shingen). By the end of the eighth month of 1551, nearly the whole court, save for the emperor himself and the palace ladies, was in Yamaguchi.

The military establishment of the Ōuchi resented Yoshitaka&#x27;s apparent &quot;weakness&quot; and his plan to settle the imperial court in Yamaguchi — such a move would see privileges accorded to the courtiers and undermine their own standing within the Ōuchi clan. In September 1551, the faction led by Sue Harukata revolted and attempted to take over the Ōuchi clan. With the control of troops in Harukata&#x27;s hand, it was over in few days—the courtiers and ministers were massacred and Yoshitaka was forced to perform seppuku at the Tainei-ji Temple (大寧寺) in Nagato Province after composing his death poem:
&lt;poem&gt;
Both the victor
and the vanquished are
but drops of dew,
but bolts of lightning –
thus should we view the world.　
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Atella was an ancient Oscan city of Campania, located 20km directly north of Naples.

== Remains ==
The ruins of the city walls, private houses, the so-called &quot;garden of Virgil&quot; and many tombs remain, on sites in the &quot;comuni&quot; of Frattaminore, Orta di Atella, Sant&#x27;Arpino and Succivo, the last three of which formed the &quot;comune&quot; of Atella di Napoli in the mid‑20th century. The territory of ancient Atella is now in the &quot;comuni&quot; of Caivano, Cardito, Cesa, Frattamaggiore, Grumo Nevano and Sant&#x27;Antimo. The archaeological museum of Atella is at Succivo.

The Atellan farce was one of the forms of entertainment of local origin that influenced the Latin theatre.

== History ==
Atella was a city of Oscan origin, one of the oldest in Campania and one of the first to have obtained the Roman &quot;civitas&quot;. It was crossed by the &quot;Via Atellana&quot;, which led southwest to Cumae and northeast to Capua. Part of the route of Via Atellana is preserved today, with the same name, in the stretch that crosses Frattaminore.

Atella is not mentioned until the Second Punic War, when, although an independent city striking its own coinage, it was allied with Capua and the other Campanian cities in siding with Carthage after the battle of Cannae. It was occupied by Rome in 210 BC, the chief citizens executed and the survivors enslaved or exiled to Calatia; the city was refounded as a home for the refugees from Nuceria. In the 1st century BC, Cicero speaks highly of it and appears to have been its patron; it continued into imperial times as a &quot;municipium&quot;.
In the slave revolt of Spartacus, the slave army was brought to the city after they defeated Lucius Furius and Lucius Cossinius in Nuceria. Near the city, a fight broke out between the rebels and a Roman force.

Augustus was cured here of a serious illness by the physician Marcus Antonius Musa with a therapy of cold baths in 23 BC.

== Ecclesiastical history ==

The Christian bishopric with see at Atella (or rather modern Orta di Atella) dates back, according to recent hagiography, to a bishop named Canio, martyred under the Roman Emperor Diocletian in about 300 (traditionally 313 AD). The Greek legend of Saint Januarius mentions a bishop of Atella as one of those who accompanied the relics of that saint to Naples. A later bishop of Atella named Elpidius built a church over the tomb of Canio; in the 9th century, the cathedral of Atella was dedicated to Bishop Elpidius as Saint Elpidius. In two of his letters, Pope Gregory the Great (592 and 599) mentions a Bishop Importunus of Atella; the second letter announces that Bishop Importunus is dead, and a successor should be elected. 

The relics of Saint Canio were moved to Acerenza in 799, and those of Saint Elpidius were taken to Salerno, probably because of the destruction and insecurity caused by the wars between Byzantines and Lombards. The diocese of Atella continued to exist until it became one of those incorporated into the new see of Aversa, which was founded in 1053. 

Bishop Godefridus of Atella attended the Lateran synod of Pope Nicholas II in April and May 1059 and subscribed its decrees as &quot;Godefridus Episcopus Attelanensis&quot;. This was exactly the time when Count Richard of Aversa, who became Prince of Capua in 1058, began his consolidation and expansion of the power of Capua, supported by the Papacy which hoped to regain its control over the Lombards in south Italy. An immediate and continual confrontation between Norman Capua and Lombard Naples, both politically and ecclesiastically, and with ethnic overtones, lasted for the next century. The archbishops of Naples claimed metropolitan status over Aversa since the territory was that of their suffragan bishop of Atella; they asserted the right to consecrate its bishops and receive oaths of loyalty from them. At the same time, the Princes of Capua claimed that Aversa was a new foundation, thanks to their work for the Roman Church, and in no case did the Norman Prince intend to recognize the jurisdiction of the Lombards over his principality.

The title of the former diocese of Atella, without any diocesan organization or territory, is currently used by the Catholic Church as a titular see. The town has a former cathedral, the 14th-century duomo of Santa Maria da Nives.

<text>The Warsaw University of Life Sciences (, SGGW) is the largest agricultural university in Poland, established in 1816 in Warsaw. It employs over 2,600 staff including over 1,200 academic educators. The University is since 2005 a member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) which was established in 2001. The SGGW offers some 37 different fields of study, 13 faculties in Agricultural Sciences, Economic Sciences, Humanities, Technical as well as Life Sciences. Its Agriculture and Forestry and Veterinary Medicine have been ranked as top 41 and 51-70 in the world on QS top university ranking 2023.

==History==
On 23 September 1816 the School of Agronomy was founded at Marymont and was accommodated in the palace of Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d&#x27;Arquien. Branches were established at Bielany, Ruda, Wawrzyszew and Buraków. An Institute of Veterinary Medicine was established at Rządowa, followed by the Institute of Rural Economy and Forestry in 1840. As Poland was ruled by the Tsar of Russia there were attempts at Russification which nearly resulted in the closure of the school, but it was transferred first to Puławy and later to Russia. After the independence of Poland in 1918 the Institute was returned to Warsaw and became the Major School of Rural Economy in 1919. Horticultural studies were added to those of agriculture and forestry in 1921. Activity was disrupted by the Second World War and resumed in 1945. The veterinary faculty was transferred from the University of Warsaw in 1952, and later the departments of agricultural drainage, wood technology, animal husbandry, and of landscape, now known as the Landscape Architecture Section, were established. Land and farms at Wolica and Natolin were acquired in 1956 and used for development. In 1973 the faculties of agricultural technology and human nutrition were established. The Rector of the university has an office in the historic palace of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, now known as &quot;the rector&#x27;s palace.&quot;

==Campus==

The campus is located is the southernmost district of Warsaw, Ursynów. The campus has a historic part, with an 18th century palace, and a contemporary part where most of the faculty buildings and dormitories are situated. On 70-hectare main campus are located 12 dormitories, a modern library, a sports centre (with tennis courts, a sports hall and a swimming pool) a foreign languages centre, a veterinary clinic.

<text>In theoretical physics, the Hořava–Witten theory argues that the cancellation of anomalies guarantees that a supersymmetric gauge theory with the E8 gauge group propagates on a type of domain wall. This domain wall, a Hořava–Witten domain wall, behaves as a boundary of the eleven-dimensional spacetime in M-theory. Proposed by Petr Hořava and Edward Witten, the theory is important for various relations between M-theory and superstring theory.

The word is known for being the last word defined in the &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International Dictionary, Unabridged&quot; released in September 1961. It also appears in the 1939 Second edition, and is still present in current versions.

<text>Petr Hořava (born 1963 in Prostějov) is a Czech string theorist. He is a professor of physics in the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he teaches courses on quantum field theory and string theory. Hořava is a member of the theory group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

==Work==
Hořava is known for his articles written with Edward Witten about the Hořava–Witten domain walls in M-theory. These articles demonstrated that the ten-dimensional heterotic formula_1 string theory could be produced from 11-dimensional M-theory by making one of the dimensions have edges (the domain walls). This discovery provided crucial support for the conjecture that all string theories could arise as limits of a single higher-dimensional theory.

Hořava is less well known for his discovery of D-branes, usually attributed to Jin Dai, Robert Leigh and Joseph Polchinski, who discovered them independently, also in 1989.

In 2009, Hořava proposed a theory of gravity that separates space from time at high energy while matching some predictions of general relativity at lower energies.

<text>The Division of Capricornia is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland.

Capricornia is a traditionally a Labor-voting electorate, having been Labor-held for 72 years of the 100 years since 1922. However, Capricornia has recently trended towards the Coalition since 2013. This political realignment was particularly noticeable at the 2019 Australian federal election as blue-collar but highly paid mining workers deserted Labor for Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation and the Coalition. Similar voting trends can be found in the nearby electorates of Flynn, Dawson, and Leichhardt.

The current MP is Michelle Landry, a member of the National Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The Division of Capricornia includes the city of Rockhampton, as well as neighbouring towns such as Yeppoon.

==History==

The division was one of the original 65 divisions contested at the first federal election. It is named after the Tropic of Capricorn, which runs through the Division. It is located on the central Queensland coast and its centre has always been the city of Rockhampton. On its current boundaries it also includes the town of Yeppoon and Ooralea, Marian and Sarina, all southern suburbs of Mackay.

The first election saw Alexander Paterson, with 51% of votes, narrowly elected over the ALP candidate Wallace Nelson. For most of its subsequent history it has been a fairly safe seat for the ALP. This was especially true when Gladstone was part of the seat from 1901 to 1984. Even after Gladstone was redistributed to Hinkler in 1984 (it is now part of Flynn), it remained one of the few non-metropolitan seats where Labor consistently did well. Labor held it for all but two terms from 1961 to 2013, the two exceptions being the high-tide elections of 1975 and 1996. Its best-known member was Frank Forde, who was briefly Prime Minister of Australia in 1945.

Capricornia is currently held by Michelle Landry for the Liberal National Party who in 2016, became the first conservative MP to serve more than one term in the seat since George Pearce.

<doc id="1190961" wikidata="Q3350937" url="?curid=1190961" title="Bangla Congress">
<text>The Bangla Congress was a regional political party in the Indian state of West Bengal. It was formed through a split in the Indian National Congress in 1966 and later co-governed with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) in two United Front governments, the first lasting from 15 March 1967 to 2 November 1967, the second from 25 February 1969 to 19 March 1970.

==History==

Mainly the Left Wing of the Bengal Congress, represented by Ajoy Mukherjee, Pranab Mukherjee, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury, Abha Maiti, Sushil Kumar Dhara revolted against the leadership of the old conservative elites of &quot;the Syndicate&quot; like Prafulla Chandra Sen and Atulya Ghosh in 1966 owing to the policies of the Prafulla Sen government during the Food Movement. Sushil Kumar Dhara was the state secretary of the newly formed Bangla Congress. 

The revolt was mainly led by younger leaders of the Congress and enjoyed widespread support among the rural landowning and trading classes as well as the middle castes of rural Bengal, such as the Mahishyas, Aguris and the Sadgops who looked upon an alliance with the Proletarian Left Front as useful against the dominance of the Calcutta-oriented Congress leadership which was seen to favour the Calcutta-based, Marwari owned large private industries and British business interests too much.

The Party had a strong base in Midnapore, Hooghly, Nadia, Murshidabad and all of North Bengal and a big plank was development of rural areas and small towns as opposed to the Calcutta-obsessed approach of the Congress-led West Bengal Government.

Ajoy Mukherjee, a veteran Congress leader from Tamluk, was the Chief Minister in both governments formed by the Coalition and till date, he remains the only Chief Minister of West Bengal not to reside in a Calcutta postal address. Other later Congress leaders like Priya Ranjan DasMunshi, Manas Bhunia and Somen Mitra also started their careers as lower rung student leaders of the Bangla Congress split. Sukumar Roy, a dissident leader of the party, aligned with CPI(M), and later formed a new political party - Biplobi Bangla Congress.

On 19 March 1970 the second United Front government fell as a result of the breakdown of the alliance between the Bangla Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Due to the Land Reform movement led by Communist leaders Benoy Choudhury and Hare Krishna Konar which threatened the interests of the landowning Middle/backward castes that supported the Bangla Congress.

The Bangla Congress then went into rapid decline and was later reunified with the Indian National Congress.

<text>The General Register Office for England and Wales (GRO) is the section of the United Kingdom HM Passport Office responsible for the civil registration of births (including stillbirths), adoptions, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths in England and Wales and for those same events outside the UK if they involve a UK citizen and qualify to be registered in various miscellaneous registers. With a small number of historic exceptions involving military personnel, it does not deal with records of such events occurring within the land or territorial waters of Scotland, Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland; those entities&#x27; registration systems have always been separate from England and Wales.
The GRO was founded in 1836 by the  (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 86), and civil registration commenced in 1837. Its head is the Registrar General. Probably the most distinguished person associated with the GRO in the 19th century, although he was never its head, was William Farr.

The GRO supplies copies of birth, marriage, civil partnership certificates and death certificates, either online or from one of the local register offices that act on behalf of the GRO.

==History of the GRO==

===Establishment===
Prior to the creation of the General Register Office (GRO) in 1837, there was no national system of civil registration in England and Wales. Baptisms, marriages and burials were recorded in parish registers maintained by Church of England (Anglican) clergy. However, with the great increase in nonconformity and the gradual relaxation of the laws against Catholics and other dissenters from the late 17th century, more and more baptisms, marriages and burials were going unrecorded in the registers of the Anglican Church.

The increasingly poor state of English parish registration led to numerous attempts to shore up the system in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The Clandestine Marriages Act 1753 (26 Geo. 2. c. 33) attempted to prevent &quot;clandestine&quot; marriages by imposing a standard form of entry for marriages, which had to be signed by both parties to the marriage and by witnesses. Additionally, except in the case of Jews and Quakers, legal marriages had to be carried out according to the rites of the Church of England. Sir George Rose&#x27;s Parochial Registers Act 1812 (52 Geo. 3. c. 146) laid down that all events had to be entered on standard entries in bound volumes. It also declared that the church registers of Nonconformists were not admissible in court as evidence of births, marriages and deaths. Only those maintained by the clergy of the Church of England could be presented in court as legal documents, and this caused considerable hardship for Nonconformists. A number of proposals were presented to Parliament to set up centralised registries for recording vital events in the 1820s but none came to fruition.

Eventually, increasing concern that the poor registration of baptisms, marriages and burials undermined property rights by making it difficult to establish lines of descent, coupled with the complaints of Nonconformists, led to the establishment in 1833 of a parliamentary select committee on parochial registration. This took evidence on the state of the parochial system of registration, and made proposals that were eventually incorporated into the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 and the Marriage Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 85). In addition, the government wanted to survey matters such as infant mortality, fertility and literacy to bring about improvements in health and social welfare. The medical establishment advocated this because a rapidly growing population in the northern industrial towns – caused by the Industrial Revolution – had created severe overcrowding, and the links between poor living conditions and short life expectancy were now known.

The answer was the establishment of a civil registration system. It was hoped that improved registration of vital events would protect property rights through the more accurate recording of lines of descent. Civil registration would also remove the need for Nonconformists to rely upon the Church of England for registration, and provide medical data for research. As a result, in 1836, legislation was passed that ordered the civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales. This took effect from 1 July 1837. A General Register Office was set up in London and the office of Registrar General was established.

England and Wales were divided into 619 registration districts (623 from 1851), each under the supervision of a superintendent registrar. The districts were based on the recently introduced poor law unions. The registration districts were further divided into sub-districts (there could be two or more), each under the charge of registrars who were appointed locally.

===Early history===
Although the GRO was not specifically established to undertake statistical research, the early Registrars General, Thomas Henry Lister (1836–42) and George Graham (1842–79), built up a Statistical Department to compile medical, public health and actuarial statistics. Much of this work was undertaken in the early to mid-Victorian period by William Farr, the GRO&#x27;s Superintendent of Statistics. Under these men the Annual reports of the Registrar General became a vehicle for administrative and social reform. In 1840 the GRO also took over responsibility for the decennial census of England and Wales.

In 1871, the GRO came under the supervision of the Local Government Board. During the First World War the GRO was responsible for co-ordinating National Registration, which underpinned recruitment to the armed forces, the movement of workers into the munitions industries, and rationing. National Registration was not, however, continued after the war and the GRO was absorbed into the Ministry of Health in 1919.

===Departmental responsibility===
In 1970 the GRO became part of the newly created Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), with the Registrar General in overall charge. Until then it had had several statistical functions, including the conduct of population censuses and the production of annual population estimates; all these were moved elsewhere within the new organisation. The GRO then became a division within OPCS, headed by a Deputy Registrar General. Then in 1996 the OPCS, and therefore the GRO, became part of the newly created Office for National Statistics, and the office of Registrar General was merged with that of Head of the Government Statistical Service.

====Becoming part of the Home Office====
On 1 April 2008, the General Register Office for England and Wales (GRO) became a subsidiary of the Identity and Passport Service (IPS), then an executive agency of the Home Office. The decision to make the transfer of GRO to IPS was finalised following the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2007. The move followed changes to make Office for National Statistics (ONS) more independent of the British Government, which included relinquishing the registration role.

In 2013, IPS was renamed HM Passport Office, while remaining an agency of the Home Office.

===Location===
From its beginnings in 1836, the General Register Office was based within the North Wing of Somerset House in London. There it remained until 1970 when it moved within London to St Catherine&#x27;s House on Kingsway. For a short time after the move the death records were stored at Alexandra House (on the opposite side of Kingsway), until room was found for all the records at St Catherine&#x27;s House. In 1997 the GRO staff were moved to Southport, Merseyside while public access to the records and indexes was made available at a new Family Records Centre (FRC) in Clerkenwell. This facility was jointly operated by the National Archives so that public access to census returns was also available at the same location. The FRC was closed in 2008, in response to steadily decreasing visitor numbers caused by the increased online availability of the records.

The GRO is now located at Smedley Hydro in Southport, a former hydropathic hotel that has been converted into offices for the GRO and the NHS Information Centre, formerly the NHS Central Register.

==The GRO registration process==
=== Births ===
In the early days of the system, it was up to each local registrar to find out what births had taken place in his sub-district, often employing help to do so. Mark Herber gives an estimate that in some parts of England up to 15% of births between 1837 and 1875 were not registered, although some perceived omissions were due to missing indexes, wrongly indexed entries and spelling errors. As a result of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 38), from 1875 the onus was on parents to inform the registrar when they had a child, and penalties were imposed on those who failed to register. Births had to be registered within 42 days at the district or sub-district office, usually by the mother or father, or for a fee the registrar could visit the home.

Until 1926, there were no registrations at all of stillborn children. For illegitimate children, the original 1836 legislation provided that &quot;it shall not be necessary to register the name of any father of a bastard child&quot;. From 1850, instructions to registrars were clarified to state that, &quot;No putative father is allowed to sign an entry in the character of &#x27;Father&#x27;.&quot; However, the law was changed again in 1875 to allow a father of an illegitimate child to record his name on his child&#x27;s birth certificate if he attended the register office with the mother. In 1953 a child&#x27;s father could also be recorded on the birth certificate, if not married to the mother, without being physically present to sign the register.

===Marriages===
Clergy of the established Church of England are registrars for marriage. In each parish church two identical registers of marriages are kept and when they are complete, one is sent to the superintendent registrar. In the meantime, every three months it is required that a return certified by a clergy person detailing the marriages that had taken place, or else that no marriages had taken place, in the preceding three months, be submitted directly to the superintendent registrar.

The Marriage Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 85) also permitted marriages by licence to take place in approved churches, chapels and nonconformist meeting houses, other than those of the Church of England. Marriages were only legally binding if they were notified to the superintendent registrar by the officiating minister so in effect, this required the presence of a local registration officer as the authorising person. When a nonconformist minister or other religious official, such as a rabbi, performed the ceremony it was necessary for the local registrar or his assistant to be present so that the marriage was legal. This legislation was not repealed until 1898, after which date, nonconformist ministers and other religious leaders could take on the role of notifying official, if so appointed, and on the condition that their premises were licensed for the solemnising of marriage. The civil authorities, i.e. the local registrar, could also perform marriage by certificate in a register office. Changes in marriage laws since 1836 have also affected how marriages are registered, for example, civil partnerships for same-sex couples were introduced by the British Government in 2004 and the GRO records these ceremonies through its civil registration system.

===Deaths===
A death was to be registered by someone who had been present at the death or during the final illness. If that was not possible, it could be registered by the owner of the building where the person died, or if the dead person was the owner, by some other occupier of the building. There were more complicated arrangements for eventualities such as unidentified bodies being found, and cases where there was a coroner&#x27;s inquest. A death was supposed to be registered within eight days.

Since there was not necessarily a unique person clearly responsible for registering a death, in order to make sure deaths were registered, clergymen were made responsible for checking the death certificate before performing any funeral or burial service. However, they were given some leeway in case the death had not yet been registered, and could go ahead with the service provided they notified the registrar themselves within seven days. If they failed to do so they were liable for a £10 fine. This was inadequate to guarantee all deaths were registered, since in principle a body could be buried without a religious service, and those who had not been baptised (mostly young children) did not qualify for Christian burial.

Between 1858 and 1874, a certificate should state whether the death had been certified by a doctor or not. From 1875 the cause of death had to be certified by a doctor before the certificate could be issued. A death would normally be registered in the district in which it occurred. Once a death had been registered, the registrar would normally issue a Certificate for Burial or Cremation, unless the death were being investigated by the coroner or there were an inquest.

The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 38) tried to ensure all deaths were registered, by placing a duty on the persons who were supposed to register the death to do so. No specific penalty was imposed if they failed to do so, but if the registrar became aware of any deaths that had not been registered within the past year, then the registrar had a duty, and was empowered, to summon the negligent parties to the register office to get it registered. If the death had occurred more than a year previously, it was not to be registered late without special permission.

A different registration system operates in other parts of the United Kingdom.

==The GRO indexes==
Every three months, at the end of March, June, September and December, the superintendent registrars send a copy of each entry of birth, marriage and death registered by their office in that quarter, to the Registrar General in London. From these returns the General Register Office produces indexes to its records, which are open to public inspection, and the indexes can be used to order birth, marriage and death certificates.

With the exception of some extra details recorded on death certificates since 1969, the information given on certificates of birth, marriage and death has not changed since 1837, but the amount of information given in the index volumes has increased from time to time. Until 1983, the copies received by the Registrar General were bound into volumes, and three separate alphabetical indexes were prepared on a quarterly basis. The number of volumes depends on the number of people registered in each quarter. Thus there might be 10 volumes for some quarters: Vol.1 A-B, Vol.2 C-D, Vol.3 E-G and so on. From their inception, the alphabetical indexes give the surname, the forenames if registered, the registration district and the volume and the page on which the entry may be found. These details enable the appropriate record to be located. Before 1866, the indexes were written by hand on heavy parchment, though some have been replaced by printed copies. From 1984, the indexes are in annual instead of quarterly volumes. The indexes from 1984 give the month of registration as the first and second digits in the document reference number, and the next two digits give the year. Thus the reference number 0485 9 2128 refers to an event registered in April 1985. From 1860 the GRO death index specifies an age of death and from 1911 the birth index also specifies the maiden name of a child&#x27;s mother.

The GRO indexes are a major tool for persons tracing their family history, as well as those needing duplicate copies of their own birth or marriage certificates. The indexes can be viewed on microfiche at the National Archives, major libraries, county record officers, and LDS Family History Centres, and can also be searched on a pay-per-view basis on several family history websites. A free, searchable, index can be consulted online via the official General Register Office website after signing up or via the FreeBMD website. FreeBMD is an ongoing project to transcribe the whole GRO Index.

Other parts of the United Kingdom have their own indexing system.

===Other registers and indexes===
In addition to the registers already mentioned, the GRO has charge of a number of other records in its Overseas Section. These indexes can be searched online at pay-per-view family history websites and at the National Archives. They generally contain similar information to the main GRO indexes and registers. The Regimental Registers, Chaplains&#x27; Returns, Consular Returns, Army Births, Marriages and Deaths and the War Deaths are some of the most significant. The civil registration records that pertain to British people in India and countries in the Far East, formerly part of the British Empire, are found in the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library.

==GRO certificates and their content==
Using the information obtained from the GRO Index it is possible to obtain a certificate online from the certificate ordering service. The GRO currently charge £12.50 for each certificate of birth, marriage or death, although a more expensive premium service is available for those who need copies of documents quickly. GRO certificates are used as a source by family historians to trace ancestry as well as being used for official purposes like applying for a passport.

Birth certificates issued by the GRO are printed on a red form and contain the following information:
* the registration district and sub-district;
* the entry number;
* the name of the child (if already bestowed);
* the date and place of birth;
* the sex;
* the name of the father;
* the name and maiden name of the mother;
* and the profession or occupation of the father;
* the name, address and position of the informant (e.g. mother)
* the date of registration and the name of the registrar
* a name given after registration e.g. if they were given a different name after baptism if within 12 months of the birth being registered.
Marriage certificates issued by the GRO are printed on a green form and give the following information:
* the date and place of solemnisation of the marriage;
* the names, addresses and condition (formerly bachelor or widower, now single, previous marriage dissolved etc) of both parties to the marriage; 
* the rank or profession of both their parents (since May 2021, previously just fathers;
* the name of at least two witnesses and the officiating minister or registrar;
* whether the marriage was by banns, licence or registrar&#x27;s certificate.
Death certificates issues by the GRO are printed on a black and purple form and give the following information:
* the registration district and sub-district
* the entry number;
* name of the deceased, their supposed age at death and occupation
* the cause of death
* date and place of death
* the informant and their relationship to the deceased
* the name of the registrar;
* from 1969 death certificates also record the date and place of birth of the deceased and, if applicable, the maiden name of a woman.

Certificates issued in other parts of the United Kingdom contain different or additional information and have a different format.

Certificates issued by the GRO clearly state that they are certified copies of the register entries, that they are not evidence of a person&#x27;s identity, and that there are criminal offences relating the unlawful amendment or falsification of a certificate, or using or possessing a false certificate. Certificates contain the seal of the General Register Office and show an abridged version of the Royal Coat of Arms.

==Digitisation and Indexing (D&amp;I) Project==
A project, called DoVE (Digitisation of Vital Events), to digitise the GRO&#x27;s records of birth, marriage and death was initiated in 2005. Implementation of the project was outsourced to Siemens IT Solutions and Services in a three-year contract which expired at the end of July 2008. The process of scanning, digitising and indexing suffered severe delays, with only (roughly) half the records delivered by the end of the contract period. By mutual agreement between the IPS and Siemens, the contract was not extended. Digitisation of birth records up to 1934 and death records up to 1957 had been completed when the contract ended.

The records that have been digitised – over 130 million of them – form part of a system (called EAGLE, for &quot;Electronic Access to GRO Legacy Events&quot;) which is used within the GRO to fulfil requests for certificates from the general public. A different system, known as MAGPIE (&quot;MultiAccess to GRO Public Index of Events&quot;), was intended to make the indexes available to the public via a website, but this will not now be implemented. Instead, following a lengthy review of options, a new project, called the Digitisation and Indexing (D&amp;I) Project, was initiated.

The D&amp;I Project was planned to: complete the digitisation of birth, marriage and death records; create an online index to those records; and improve the certificate ordering process. In September 2010 this project was suspended pending the outcome of the latest UK Government Comprehensive Spending Review. The IPS expected to reach a decision on the future of the digitisation project during financial year 2011/12, but in August 2012 it was announced that &quot;there are no current plans to resume this work&quot;. However, the IPS says it &quot;will continue to monitor the scope for future opportunities to digitise all birth, death and marriage records&quot;.

<doc id="1190967" wikidata="Q805677" url="?curid=1190967" title="Balti people">
<text>The Baltis are a Tibetic ethnic group who are native to the Pakistani-administered territory of Gilgit−Baltistan and the Indian-administered territory of Ladakh, predominantly in the Kargil district with smaller concentrations present in the Leh district. Outside of the Kashmir region, Baltis are scattered throughout Pakistan, with the majority of the diaspora inhabiting prominent urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

==Origin==
The origin of the name &quot;Balti&quot; is unknown. The first written mention of the Balti people occurs in the 2nd century BCE by the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer Ptolemy, who refers to the region as &quot;Byaltae&quot;. The Balti people themselves refer to their native land as &quot;Balti-yul&quot; (); the modern name of &quot;Baltistan&quot; is the Persian rendering of this name.

==Language==
The Balti language belongs to the Tibetic language family. Read (1934) considers it to be a dialect of Ladakhi, while Nicolas Tournadre (2005) instead considers it to be a sister language of Ladakhi. The Balti language remains highly archaic and conservative, closer to Classical Tibetan than other Tibetan languages.

==Religion==
The Baltis still retain many cultural traits of pre-Islamic Bön and Tibetan Buddhist rituals within their society, making them a unique demographic group in Pakistan. 

Bön and Tibetan Buddhism were the dominant religions practiced by the Balti people until the arrival of Islam in Baltistan around the 14th century CE, predominantly through Sufi missionaries such as Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani. The Noorbakshia Sufi sect further propagated the Islamic faith in the region, and most of the Balti had converted to Islam by the end of the 17th century. 

Over time, a significant number of Baltis converted to Shia Islam, while a few converted to Sunni Islam.

Baltis see congregation in mosques and Sufi Khanqahs as an important religious ritual. Khanqahs are training schools introduced by early Sufi saints who arrived in the region. The students gain spiritual purity (tazkiah) through this training (meditations and contemplations) under well-practiced spiritual guides who have already attained a certain degree of spirituality.

Mosques in Baltistan are predominantly built in the Tibetan style of architecture, though several mosques have wood-finishings and decorations in the Mughal style, which is also seen in the Kargil district of Indian-administered Ladakh, across the Line of Control.

Today, around 60% of Baltis are Shia Muslims, while some 30% practice Noorbakshia Sufi Islam, and 10% are Sunni Muslims.

In India, 97% of Baltis are Muslims and 3% of Baltis are Buddhists.

<text>In ancient Rome, the Latin term  (: ) referred to a town or city. Etymologically, the was a social contract among (&#x27;duty holders&#x27;), or citizens of the town. The duties () were a communal obligation assumed by the in exchange for the privileges and protections of citizenship. Every citizen was a .

The distinction of was not made in the Roman Kingdom; instead, the immediate neighbours of the city were invited or compelled to transfer their populations to the urban structure of Rome, where they took up residence in neighbourhoods and became Romans . Under the Roman Republic the practical considerations of incorporating communities into the city-state of Rome forced the Romans to devise the concept of , a distinct state under the jurisdiction of Rome. It was necessary to distinguish various types of and other settlements, such as the colony. In the early Roman Empire these distinctions began to disappear; for example, when Pliny the Elder served in the Roman army, the distinctions were only nominal. In the final stage of development, all citizens of all cities and towns throughout the empire were equally citizens of Rome. The then simply meant municipality, the lowest level of local government.

==Creation of a ==
The and the citizenship and its rights and protections were specific to the community. No matter where a person lived, at home or abroad, or what his status or class, he was a citizen of the locality in which he was born. The distinguishing characteristic of the was self-governance. Like any ancient city-state, the was created by an official act of synoecism, or founding. This act removed the sovereignty and independence from the signatory local communities, replacing them with the jurisdiction of a common government. This government was then called the (&#x27;public affair&#x27;), or in the Greek world the (&#x27;common affair&#x27;).

The term began to be used with reference to the city-states of Italy brought into the city-state of Rome but not incorporated into the city. The city of Romulus synoecised the nearby settlements of Latium, transferring their populations to the seven hills, where they resided in typically distinct neighbourhoods. And yet, Sabines continued to live in the Sabine Hills and Alba Longa continued even though synoecised. The exact sequence of events is not known, whether the populace was given a choice or the synoecised sites were reoccupied. As it is unlikely that all the Sabines were invited to Rome, where facilities to feed and house them did not yet exist, it seems clear that population transfer was only offered to some. The rest continued on as independent localities under the ultimate governance of Rome. Under the Roman Republic the impracticality of transferring numerous large city-states to Rome was manifest. The answer to the problem was the . The town would be partially synoecised. The local government would remain but to its would be added due to the city of Rome. The partial synoecism took the form of a charter granting incorporation into the city of Rome and defining the rights and responsibilities of the citizens. The first was Tusculum.
==Two orders of the ==
The citizens of of the first order held full Roman citizenship and their rights () included the right to vote, which was the ultimate right in Rome, and a sure sign of full rights.

The second order of comprised important tribal centres which had come under Roman control. Residents of these did not become full Roman citizens (although their magistrates could become so after retirement). They were given the duties of full citizens in terms of liability to taxes and military service, but not all of the rights: most significantly, they had no right to vote.

Executive power in was held by four annually elected officials, composed of two duumvirs and two aediles. Advisory powers were held by the decurions, appointed members of the local equivalent to the Senate. In later years, these became hereditary.

==Examples for grants of ==
# Volubilis in the province of Mauretania (modern day Morocco) was promoted to a by the Emperor Claudius as a reward for its help in a revolt in AD 40–41.
# The Emperor Vespasian granted &#x27;Latin rights&#x27; to the provinces of Hispania (Tarraconensis, Baetica, Lusitania) in AD 73 or 74.
# Marcus Servilius Draco Albucianus from Tripolitania successfully petitioned Rome to grant the status of on his town.

<text>The Wirral Railway was a railway network in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, England. Its route was from Birkenhead Park in the east of the Wirral to West Kirby in the west. A branch off this line at Bidston went north to Secombe and New Brighton. It was incorporated in 1863 as the Hoylake Railway, running from Hoylake to Birkenhead Docks. After changes of name and of ownership, it was purchased by the Wirral Railway Company Limited in 1884. The network was extended to West Kirby, New Brighton, and Seacombe, and to Birkenhead Park station where it joined the Mersey Railway, enabling through trains through the Mersey Railway Tunnel to Liverpool. In the 1923 grouping the Wirral company became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which electrified the line (except the Seacombe branch) in 1938, allowing passenger services to be integrated with the Liverpool urban system. Most of the Wirral Railway network is still in use today as part of the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail rail network.

==Hoylake Railway==
The Chester and Birkenhead Railway opened on 23 September 1840. This was the first penetration of the Wirral by a railway, and for some years no further attempt was made to build in the peninsula.

Observing the success of the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway in encouraging residential building, and travel, a group of business people led by Braithwaite Pool, a career railwayman, proposed a railway, to be called the Hoylake Railway. It was to connect Hoylake with Birkenhead. The route was soon modified to connect Seacombe (instead of Birkenhead) to Hoylake, with a branch from Bidston to Wallasey Bridge Road to serve Birkenhead docks. Parliamentary powers were obtained on 28 July 1863. Authorised capital was £100,000 with £33,000 in permitted borrowing.

The Hoylake company desposited further bills in quick succession, showing a desire to reach far beyond the initial area and break the Great Western Railway (GWR) and London and North Western Railway (LNWR) duopoly in the Wirral; these proposals included a long viaduct over the River Dee to Mostyn. All the Bills were heavily cut back or rejected.

In the event the Seacombe portion of the line was not built at this stage as it would have been particularly expensive. Accordingly, the railway was constructed as a single line from Hoylake to Wallasey Bridge Road only, a distance of just over five miles. It was inspected by Captain Ritchie of the Board of Trade on 16 June 1866 and was opened to traffic on Monday 18 June 1866. However this apparently did not result in a regular train service until 2 July 1866, following a further inspection by Ritchie on that date. There were six trains a day, four on Sundays, running from &quot;Birkenhead Docks&quot; (i.e. Wallasey Bridge Road) to Hoylake; an omnibus connection was operate to Seacombe. &quot;All the stations were of the most elementary type, having cinder platforms very scantily supplied with buildings, a state of affairs which in the case of the intermediate stations has persisted to the time of electrification.&quot;

==Financial performance==
Although passenger business was very brisk at first, this soon tailed off and the financial performance of the company was very poor, and the train service was reduced. Robinson wrote: &quot;The building of the line was premature, however. Hoylake in those days was a small fishing village and the rest of the coast quite undeveloped, and it was soon found that the traffic was too small to make it a paying concern. Money was also owing from the construction of the line, and a Mr Vyner of Bidston had not been paid for land the company had acquired from him; the debt was £9,000, which the company did not have at its disposal; indeed its other liabilities amounted to £20,000. He was able to arrange for bailiffs to seize part of the line at the eastern end of the network, and traffic had to be suspended.

It was reported:

Sale of a Railway: ln pursuance of a Chancery decree, obtained by Mr. Robert Vyner, who has never been paid for his land, that portion of the Birkenhead and Hoylake Railway which runs through his property, was offered for sale by auction at the Queen’s Hotel, Chester, on Saturday [18 September 1869]. One of the conditions of sale was that the purchaser was to pay, beyond his bid for the land, for everything found upon it a valuation made by the auctioneers, Messrs. Churton and Elphick. The solicitor representing the railway company protested against anything but the land being sold; but the auctioneer said he was acting under the authority of the Court of Chancery, and proceeded to put up the four &quot;lots&quot;. The first lot was knocked down to Messrs. Roberts and Potts, Chester, for 4,000&quot;l&quot;, the only bid; the lot including the Dock Cottages station, North Birkenhead (where the line commences), adjoining land, and the railway as far as lot two, which included the Bidston station, and a length beyond this lot being also knocked down to Mr. Roberts for 1,500&quot;l&quot;. No offers were made for the other two lots. It was stated that Mr. Roberts was acting for Mr. Vyner.

In fact Vyner had bought back his own land, and generously did not force closure of the railway for some time. However he must have lost patience eventually, for on 30 June 1870 a writ of ejectment was secured for him, and the Hoylake Railway was required to remove all its movable assets from the affected land. The section of line westward from Leasowe to Hoylake, outside Vyner&#x27;s area of interest, was kept in operation for the time being, from 8 July 1870. Road coaches provided connections from Leasowe level crossing, where there was no proper station, and Birkenhead and Seacombe.

==Hoylake and Birkenhead Rail and Tramway Company==
A new company, the &quot;Hoylake &amp; Birkenhead Tramway Company&quot;, was formed on 19 November 1870. Its objective may have been to acquire the Hoylake company&#x27;s line and convert it to a tramway. It soon deposited a parliamentary bill to build a line from Woodside to Birkenhead Docks, but there proved to be procedural difficulties and the new company was dissolved by Act of 1 July 1872, when a new company, the Hoylake &amp; Birkenhead Rail and Tramway Company was incorporated. It was authorised to operate street running tramways in Birkenhead, and to take over the assets and operation of the Hoylake Railway. It acquired the assets of the Hoylake Company for £22,000 and settled the outstanding debt with Vyner. The railway part of its operation was started on 1 August 1872, Vyner&#x27;s part of the line evidently having been retained intact. In 1873 the company opened a street tramway between Wallasey Bridge Road and the Woodside ferry terminal in Birkenhead. This was of course horse-operated; it was sold on to the Birkenhead Tramway Company on 11 October 1879.
The company extended the railway line from Hoylake to West Kirby, and, at the other end of the system, also made the short connection between Wallasey Bridge Road and the docks. Both of these new sections were opened on 1 April 1878. Now concentrating on its railway operation, the company changed its name to the &quot;Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway&quot;, by an act of Parliament, the (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. cxv), of 18 July 1881.

==Wirral Railway==
The Wirral Railway was incorporated by act of 13 June 1883; it was to build a &quot;Dee Extension&quot; line from Bidston (on the Hoylake line) to Hawarden Bridge on the River Dee, and another line from the Birkenhead Central station of the Mersey Railway to Woodchurch. Woodchurch was a place on the Dee Extension a little south of the present-day Upton station on the Hawarden Bridge line.

In fact the Woodchurch line was not built; but on 14 August 1884 the company were authorised to build from Bidston to New Brighton.

==Wirral Railway Company Limited==
Also authorised on 14 August 1884 was a separate company, the &quot;Wirral Railway Company Limited&quot;. This new company was authorised to purchase the previous Wirral Railway company as well as the Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway. Having acquired those companies, the WRC Ltd kept them in existence for the time being. In substitution for the cancelled Woodchurch line, the earlier Wirral Railway company had obtained powers to extend from near Wallasey Bridge Road to Birkenhead Park, joining the Mersey Railway there; there was to be an intermediate station at Birkenhead Docks. The Docks station was now constructed by the SH&amp;DR and, with a short section of connecting line, opened on 2 January 1888, when Wallasey Bridge Road station was closed. The (original) Wirral Railway constructed the extension to Birkenhead Park, and that opened on the same day. The Mersey Railway had extended its own line to meet the Wirral at Birkenhead Park, and that extension too opened on 2 January 1888.

By this time, the train service had been increased to 22 each way on weekdays, 8 on Sundays. For a period, convenient changes of trains were provided at Birkenhead Park, but through trains were run from 1 May 1890. The Wirral engines did not have the power to climb the gradient in the Mersey Tunnel, nor condensing equipment, so the trains changed engines at Birkenhead Park. The through trains continued until 30 June 1894, when disagreements between the Wirral and Mersey companies led to a suspension of co-operation.

==New Brighton==
Writing in 1914, Mercer observed that the Wirral had become known as &quot;&#x27;The Dormitory of Liverpool&#x27; owing to the number of people who reside on the Cheshire side of the Mersey and travel across under the water daily to and from business.&quot; In addition, New Brighton had become a popular destination for trippers by steamer, but the railway transformed it into a residential town. The Wirral Railway extended from a triangular junction west of Birkenhead Docks to Wallasey, Grove Road. This too opened on 2 January 1888, and was completed as far as New Brighton on 30 March in the same year.

==Absorption of the SH&amp;DR==

The Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway had been wholly owned by the Wirral Railway Company Limited, and on 11 June 1891 it was fully absorbed. Construction to Seacombe itself was now undertaken; as this was a ferry terminal, heavy residential traffic was foreseen. Branching from the New Brighton line by another triangular junction, the Seacombe line was difficult in engineering terms, but it was opened on 1 June 1895. The hoped-for residential traffic did not develop as intended, with residential passengers preferring the convenience of travel by the Mersey Railway over a transfer to a ferry that could not convey them to the centre of Liverpool.

The eastern chord of the triangular junction with the New Brighton line was chiefly used by a summer passenger service between Seacombe and New Brighton, but by this time a direct tramway service was in operation, and this was found much more convenient. The train service was discontinued in 1911, and the east chord was closed and the rails sent to France during World War I.

==Main line improvements==
The main line to West Kirby was single track, with passing places at Moreton and Hoylake after 1878. With increasing traffic volumes this became an operational difficulty, and the line was doubled as far as Hoylake in June 1895; Hoylake to West Kirby was doubled in 1896. The joint railway of the London and North Western Railway and the Great Western Railway had reached West Kirby, and there were discussions about the provision of a joint station there to include the Wirral operation; but these were inconclusive and separate stations were built. The Wirral rebuilt and extended its West Kirby station in 1898 - 1899.

==Hawarden Bridge line==
The Wirral Railway had obtained powers for a &quot;Dee Extension&quot; in 1883, but this long route had been unaffordable. In 1889 the powers for construction were transferred to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the Wrexham, Mold and Connah&#x27;s Quay Railway jointly. The line became known as the &quot;North Wales and Liverpool Railway&quot; and the transfer was authorised by Act of 12 May 1889. The Wirral Railway&#x27;s interest in the line was at an end, but the MS&amp;LR and the WM&amp;CQR acquired running powers to Seacombe, which they later exercised. (The two companies became part of the London and North Eastern Railway under the &quot;grouping&quot; of the railways in 1923.)

==The 20th century==
The train service was further increased in the first years of the twentieth century, amounting to 40 or so trains each way on the main line, with eight on Sundays. The New Brighton line had 37 each way, eight on Sundays, and the Seacombe line had 17 and 8 respectively.

Pursuant to the Railways Act 1921 ownership of most of the main line railways of Great Britain was transferred to one or other of four new large companies; the process was known as the &quot;grouping&quot;. The Wirral Railway Company became part of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) at the beginning of 1923.

Writing in 1928, McNaught said

At present the only through connection to and from the Wirral section is represented by one or more through carriages running once daily in each direction between New Brighton and London (Euston). Instead of entering the terminal station at West Kirby, this train passes direct on to the joint line there, and is detached at Hooton to join a through express from Birkenhead (Woodside). This innovation has been very popular since its introduction in 1923, as the journey from Birkenhead to New Brighton, though only some 5 miles as the crow flies, is in actuality somewhat inconvenient, involving either the crossing of Birkenhead Docks by swing bridges, or a ferry trip to Liverpool landing stage, there changing to a Wallasey Corporation steamer, to complete the journey.

Since being taken over by the L.M.S., the Wirral line has been re-laid throughout, and comfortable modern rolling-stock placed in service. Train sets of eight vehicles, former L.N.W. and L. and Y. stock, are now used.

==Electrification==
The Wirral Railway had been predominantly a passenger line, with a locomotive fleet consisting of tank engines. Electrification had been considered as early as 1900; Mercer reported in 1914 that the powers had been acquired; but no action was taken then. In 1936 the LMS decided that the time was right for electrification, and work was put in hand. Station modernisation and signalling improvements were incorporated into the scheme, but the Seacombe line was scheduled for closure.

Electric power was taken at 11 kV 50 Hz 3 phase from the Clarence Dock power station; the cables were laid through the Mersey Tunnel. The traction supply to the trains was at 650 V DC by third rail. Goods traffic continued to be steam hauled. route miles of railway were electrified. It had been proposed to electrify at 1,500 v dc overhead, but this was technically impossible through the Mersey Tunnel, so the third rail system was adopted. The position of the third rail was the same as on the Watford New Line electrification, and required the Mersey Railway system to alter its third rail from 22 inches outside the running rail to 16 inches, and to fit duplicate collector shoes to its rolling stock.

The new rolling stock was in three-car units of which there were 19, with steel bodies and open saloon accommodation. They had air-operated sliding doors, and automatic couplers. There was one motor coach in each three car unit, and it was equipped with four 135 hp motors. Additional power was considered to be required for the steep gradients in the Mersey Tunnel. Electrical equipment was supplied by British Thomson-Houston, and the vehicles were manufactured by Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon Company and the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. The units later became British Rail Class 503.

Automatic notching was provided. When the trains were running in the Mersey Tunnel where there is a gradient of 1 in 27, provision was made to increase the notching point of the acceleration relay. This could be actuated by a sealed push-button in the driver&#x27;s cab, for use in exceptional circumstances, such as a six-car train operating with one motor coach out of action. Tuplin wrote that the new vehicles did not have an on-board air compressor; at the end of the run:

the motorman emerged from his compartment with a hose, lifted an iron cover plate from a hole in the station platform and connected the hose to an underground air-supply line. Incredible though it may seem, there was no compressor on the train, but reliance was placed on periodic charging of a reservoir which fed air to the Westinghouse brakes and also to the Westinghouse electro-pneumatic controllers for the traction motors. When a satisfactory charge had been obtained, the motorman turned off the cocks on supply-pipe and reservoir, and pulled up the hose with a loud &quot;sssh—ack&quot; as the air in the hose escaped.

The Wirral line was operated on the third rail system but the Mersey Railway system was on fourth rail, so the new trains were fitted with negative contact shoes and a contactor which was automatically operated according to the system. This was considered to be a cheaper option than installing a fourth rail throughout the new Wirral electrified area. There was a 50-foot gap in the conductor rails at each end of the Birkenhead Park station: the only such changing point on any British Railway.

The new service was inaugurated on 13 March 1938, with trains running through to Liverpool through the former Mersey Railway route, now also, of course part of the LMS. Trains ran every 15 minutes, enhanced to 10 minutes at the busiest times. The Seacombe branch passenger service was now exclusively operated by steam trains of the London and North Eastern Railway (as successor since 1923 to the Great Central Railway).

Through coaches from New Brighton to London had been inaugurated in 1923, one journey in each direction being made. When the New Brighton line was electrified, the London service continued at first, and was the only steam hauled passenger service on the New Brighton line. The coaches ran via West Kirby to Hooton, where they were attached to a main line train. The engine power was customarily a class 3F 0-6-0.

==After 1948==
On 1 January 1948 most of the railways of Great Britain were taken into national ownership under British Railways.

In the 1950s usage of the Seacombe branch declined steeply: both the goods traffic and passenger traffic diminished. The passenger service was withdrawn after the close of service on Sunday 3 January 1960. The branch was closed to all traffic on 17 June 1963. Some years later its route was used for the approach road to the Kingsway Tunnel that opened in 1971.

Bidston West to North curve closed officially on 28 November 1983, but the dominant traffic had been iron ore trains which ceased in 1980.

<text>A Schnorr group, proposed by Claus P. Schnorr, is a large prime-order subgroup of formula_1, the multiplicative group of integers modulo formula_2 for some prime formula_2. To generate such a group, generate formula_2, formula_5, formula_6 such that

:formula_7

with formula_2, formula_5 prime. Then choose any formula_10 in the range formula_11 until you find one such that

:formula_12.

This value

:formula_13

is a generator of a subgroup of formula_1 of order formula_5.

Schnorr groups are useful in discrete log based cryptosystems including Schnorr signatures and DSA. In such applications, typically formula_2 is chosen to be large enough to resist index calculus and related methods of solving the discrete-log problem (perhaps 1024 to 3072 bits), while formula_5 is large enough to resist the birthday attack on discrete log problems, which works in any group (perhaps 160 to 256 bits). Because the Schnorr group is of prime order, it has no non-trivial proper subgroups, thwarting confinement attacks due to small subgroups. Implementations of protocols that use Schnorr groups must verify where appropriate that integers supplied by other parties are in fact members of the Schnorr group; formula_18 is a member of the group if formula_19 and formula_20. Any member of the group except the element formula_21 is also a generator of the group.</text><links>

<text>was a samurai and retainer of the Ōuchi clan and a son of Sagara Masato.

Originally from Higo Province, he served the Ōuchi clan as his father had become a retainer of the clan. From around 1543 with the support of Ōuchi Yoshitaka, he led a faction of retainers who preached a softer approach, as opposed to the faction led by Sue Harukata, which preached a hard-line stance. One of the reasons for the internal feud of the Ōuchi clan was a result of Taketo and Harukata arguing over the future course of the clan. In 1550, facing an impending clash with Harukata, he tried to flee to Chikuzen Province, but was captured and placed under house arrest. Taketo tried to appease Harukata by having his daughter marry Harukata&#x27;s son, but the relationship remained cold.

In 1551, Harukata revolted and Taketo was killed in Hanao Castle during the Tainei-ji incident, during which Yoshitaka also died.

<doc id="1190988" wikidata="Q7869312" url="?curid=1190988" title="USS Falmouth">
<text>USS &quot;Falmouth&quot; was a sloop of war in the United States Navy during the mid-19th century.

&quot;Falmouth&quot; was launched on 3 November 1827 by Boston Navy Yard, and declared ready for sea 19 January 1828, Commander C. W. Morgan in command.

Between 1828 and 1840, &quot;Falmouth&quot; made two cruises with the West Indies Squadron and two with the Pacific Squadron. Between cruises, she was in ordinary for repairs and refittings at either New York or Norfolk or Norfolk Navy Yard.

Recommissioned after such a period in ordinary 16 December 1841, &quot;Falmouth&quot; joined the recently organized Home Squadron. &quot;Falmouth&quot; cruised from the Banks of Newfoundland to the mouth of the Amazon and in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico with this squadron until 1846, aside from necessary repair periods. She operated chiefly in the Gulf of Mexico, carrying messages and government officials, convoying Army transports to Texas, and protecting American interests in Mexico. From September 1845 to March 1846, she was flagship for the squadron&#x27;s commander, Commodore David Conner. During the opening months of the Mexican–American War, from April to September 1846, she blockaded Mexican ports, then sailed north for repairs. She lay in ordinary at Boston from 22 November 1846 until recommissioned on 26 April 1849.

Sailing for the Pacific on 16 May 1849, &quot;Falmouth&quot; protected the new American settlements on the west coast, and voyaged to various Pacific islands before returning to Norfolk on 29 January 1852. Again she lay in ordinary, from 4 February 1852 until 18 November 1854.

Between 16 December 1854 and August 1855 &quot;Falmouth&quot; cruised through the West Indies in an unsuccessful search for news of , missing since September. Returning to New York, she was in ordinary until 12 January 1857, when she was recommissioned for service on the Brazil Station. &quot;Falmouth&quot; joined in the Paraguay expedition to Paraguay late in 1858, when relations with the United States were strained, and cruised in the Paraná River and the Río de la Plata until tension eased. She sailed into New York Harbor on 19 May 1859, and on the 24th was decommissioned.

Fitted out as a stationary storeship, &quot;Falmouth&quot; departed New York on 1 April 1860 for Aspinwall, Panama, the port later known as Colón. She served there as store ship for operating in the Gulf of Mexico, until sold in October 1863.

<text>The Minister of Shipping was a British government post created in the First World War and again in the Second World War. In 1941 it was merged into the position of Minister of Transport which was then renamed Minister of War Transport.

==History==
Sir Joseph Maclay, Bt (16 December 1916 – 31 March 1921) as &quot;Shipping Controller&quot; was the first holder of the post. As Sir Joseph was not a member of either house of Parliament, a Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to represent him in the Commons. The first was Sir Leo Chiozza Money (22 December 1916) who was succeeded on 10 January 1919 by Leslie Orme Wilson who held the post until 31 March 1921

The responsibilities overseen by the minister included what had been the Transport Board that was part of the Navy Board until 1832. Oversight for the provision of naval transportation then passed to the Department of the Comptroller of Victualling and Transport Services until 1862 when it was transferred to the Board of Admiralty who set up a Transport Department. By 1890 it was renamed as the Department of the Director of Transports. In 1917 once again as the Transport Department it was temporarily absorbed into the Ministry of Shipping, and the Admiralty seconded an officer to the ministry with the title of Director of Transports and Shipping.

In 1916 a Shipping Controller was appointed to regulate merchant shipping for government purposes and to coordinate wartime shipping requirements. A Ministry of Shipping was established following the Defence Regulations of June 1917. The Ministry of Shipping, had responsibility for &#x27;sea transport of military forces and supplies, food and raw materials for industry, Atlantic, Gibraltar and Russian convoys, shipping losses and tonnage requirements, shipbuilding and other matters relating to wartime British and allied control of merchant shipping&#x27;.

In 1917, the ministry embarked on a large scale requisitioning scheme of British ships and became responsible for the maintenance and operation of a vast merchant fleet. After the end of the war in November 1918 the main functions of the ministry were the transport of troops, prisoners of war and material back to the United Kingdom, the disposal or release of requisitioned ships, and the reconditioning of vessels for release back to their private owners. The ministry was dissolved on 31 March 1921.

The Ministry of Shipping was reinstated with the outbreak of war in September 1939; it assumed responsibility for specific Sea Transport Department under auspice of the Admiralty till 1941 when it was merged with the Ministry of Transport to form the Ministry of War Transport. In 1946 the Ministry of Transport was reestablished; it then became responsible for naval transportation until 1970 when that responsibility was assumed once more by the Board of Trade.

There were three Ministers of Shipping from 1939 to 1941:
*Sir John Gilmour (13 October 1939 – 30 March 1940) (died)
*Robert Hudson (3 April – 14 May 1940)
*Ronald Cross (14 May 1940 – 1 May 1941)

<text>The Home Squadron was part of the United States Navy in the mid-19th century. Organized as early as 1838, ships were assigned to protect coastal commerce, aid ships in distress, suppress piracy and the Atlantic slave trade, make coastal surveys, and train ships to relieve others on distant stations. It was discontinued in 1861 after the outbreak of the American Civil War, when the Union blockade forced a reassignment of ships to close off Southern ports.

==History==

===Mexican–American War===
During the Mexican–American War the ships of the Home Squadron, commanded by Commodore David Conner, USN fought in several engagements against Mexican forces. Many of the Home Squadron vessels were attached to vice commander Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s Mosquito Fleet which was involved in the battles of Tuxpan, Tabasco, Villahermosa and Veracruz. No ship-to-ship combat occurred though several merchant vessels were captured, the Home Squadron primarily operated against Mexican coastal forts and artillery batteries.

===Reform War===
Since the Mexican War of Independence ending in 1821, Mexican liberals, a political party which evolved from the Masonic Lodge of the York Rite created by Joel R. Poinsett who was an American Diplomat sent by President James Monroe to secretly propose the purchase of the northern provinces from the First Mexican Empire; and the conservative party—which as its name indicates, had as its principal objective was to preserve the traditions and customs of the nation—were constantly in conflict at each other throughout the first decades of the existence of Mexico.

The continuous friction led to a major civil war known as the Reform War from 1858 to 1860 and political instability, which the U.S. government under James Buchanan saw as a great opportunity to further expand the U.S. territory limits southwards (after the acquisition through war of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, most of Colorado, south Wyoming, and a fraction of Kansas and Oklahoma. For this reason and based upon the Doctrine Monroe, the U.S government sent an emissary to discuss with Juarez&#x27;s liberal party the possibility to cede the Baja California peninsula to the United States, which he promptly accepted in exchange of diplomatic, economic and military support to counteract the conservative power that at that point, had the full support of the majority of the Mexican people, and was in control of the entire country with the exception of the cities of Morelia and Veracruz.

During the Second Siege of Veracruz in 1859, a Mexican officer named Thomas M. Marin of the Mexican Navy purchased vessels in Cuba, that he armed and equipped to sail back to Veracruz to assist and supply General Miramon&#x27;s siege of the held city. The Liberal Mexican government declared Marin&#x27;s fleet to be that of pirates so ships of the Home Squadron were ordered to intervene and arrest Marin. Two of Marin&#x27;s ships, the steamer &quot;General Miramon&quot; and the sloop-of-war &quot;Marquis of Havana&quot;, arrived at their rendezvous off Anton Lizardo. They were spotted by a Mexican fort and the frigate USS &quot;Savannah&quot; which ordered the sloop-of-war USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; to intervene with help from two steamers.

The American ships under Commander Thomas Turner approached and fired warning shots, the Mexicans obviously fired back as the American fleet had no jurisdiction within Mexican waters. Despite the fact of being outnumbered by the American fleet, the Mexican vessels engaged in battle resulting in a bloody encounter Battle of Anton Lizardo and the capture of the conservative ships and over thirty casualties on both sides. The battle played an important role in ending the Reform War with a liberal victory and the signatory of the secret MacLane-Ocampo Treaty where Juarez and the radical liberals agreed on further cessions of Mexican territory to the U.S., as well as a couple of transit concessions through the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and from Tamaulipas across Mexico to the Gulf of California in perpetuity to the U.S. that eventually was rejected by the American congress, as it was determined that the inclusion of these states into the American federation could strengthen the southern confederate states.

Due to the American intervention, the conservatives under General Miramon failed to take Veracruz from the liberals for a second time, which a few years later led Mexico to a French intervention.

<doc id="1190997" wikidata="Q158663" url="?curid=1190997" title="Physalis">
<text>Physalis (, , , , from φυσαλλίς : &quot;phusallís&quot; &#x27;bladder&#x27;) is a genus of approximately 75 to 90 flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which are native to the Americas and Australasia. At least 46 species are endemic to Mexico. Cultivated and weedy species have been introduced worldwide. A defining feature of &quot;Physalis&quot; is a large, papery husk derived from the calyx, which partly or fully encloses the fruit. Many species bear edible fruit, and some species are cultivated.

The typical &quot;Physalis&quot; fruit is similar to a firm tomato in texture, and like a sweet, tangy grape in flavor. Some species, such as the Cape gooseberry and tomatillo, have been bred into many cultivars with varying flavors, from tart to sweet to savory. Nations including Colombia, India, and Mexico have a significant economic trade in &quot;Physalis&quot; fruit. The fruits of many species are generically referred to as physalis, groundcherries, husk tomatoes, husk cherries, poha berries, and golden berries.

==Description==
&quot;Physalis&quot; species are herbaceous plants growing to tall, similar to the common tomato, a plant of the same family, but usually with a stiffer, more upright stem. They can be either annual or perennial. Most require full sun and fairly warm to hot temperatures. Some species are sensitive to frost, but others tolerate cold when dormant in winter.

===Fossil record===
A 52-million-year-old fossil fruit of &quot;Physalis&quot; has been found in Patagonia, named as &quot;Physalis infinemundi&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==

Estimates for the earliest use of Physalis for human consumption range from 900BCE to 5000BCE. Archaeological sites support the historical use of Physalis as a food for indigenous people in what is now northern Mexico and portions of the United States.

&quot;Physalis&quot; fruit are rich in cryptoxanthin. The fruit can be used like the tomato. Once extracted from its husk, it can be eaten raw and used in salads. Some varieties are added to desserts, used as flavoring, made into fruit preserves, or dried and used like raisins. They contain pectin and can be used in pie filling. Ground cherries are called &quot;poha&quot; in the Hawaiian language, and poha jam and preserves are traditional desserts made from &quot;Physalis&quot; plants grown on the Hawaiian Islands.

A 2013 literature review identified more than one hundred works with medical use of various Physalis species from the Americas. Preparations included all parts of the plants (fruits, leaves, flowers, stems, and roots) and took forms including decoction, infusion, and soaking. Herbal preparations are known to be administered internally and externally.

Physalis plants grow in most soil types and do very well in poor soils and in pots. They require moisture until fruiting. Plants are susceptible to many of the common tomato diseases and pests, and other pests such as aphids, whiteflies, spider mites, and the false potato beetle (&quot;Leptinotarsa juncta&quot;) also attack them. Propagation is by seed.

In the United States, Louisiana erroneously classifies Physalis subglabrata (smooth groundcherry) as a hallucinogenic plant, and its cultivation for other than ornamental purposes is outlawed under State Act 159 of 2005. In the Gran Chaco region of South America, the consumption of the different species of Physalis for food has declined due to sociocultural and environmental changes. Factors generally stem from the ongoing effects of colonization, including loss of ancestral territories to forestry exploitation and industrial agriculture as well as the decline of seasonal human migrations which were formerly part of the cycle of propagation, harvest, and consumption of Physalis.

==Subgenera and sections==
&quot;Physalis&quot; is divided into subgenera and sections. The taxonomy of &quot;Physalis&quot; is still an active area of taxonomic classification. About 75 to 90 species are placed in the genus.

In 1831, Nees von Esenbeck was among the first researchers to complete a review of the &quot;Physalis&quot; species that had been described until that time in order to identify synonyms and subtaxa within the genus. In 1837, George Don named the sections proposed by Nees von Esenbeck, including three names that are still in use: &quot;Physalodendron&quot; for woody species, &quot;Eurostorhiza&quot; for perennials with rhizomatous roots, and &quot;Epeteiorhiza&quot; for annual species.

Michel Félix Dunal in 1852 and Per Axel Rydberg in 1896 also published efforts to subdivide &quot;Physalis&quot;, although these were not generally consistent with the taxonomy advocated by Esenbeck and Don. Rydberg&#x27;s taxonomy identified seven species groups within a section Rydberg called &quot;Euphysalis&quot;; these groups became the basis of sections which remain in use.

Margaret Y. Menzel&#x27;s research in the 20th century provided new insights into &quot;Physalis&quot; taxonomy, including the results of her crossing experiments with 28 &quot;Physalis&quot; species and their karyological data. The groups of species previously set up by Rydberg were raised to sections by this research. A summary of all taxonomic research regarding the genus was published in 1989 by Radovan Hendrych, and the most recent major taxonomic publications were made in 1994 and 1999 by Mahinda Martínez.

A genetic study by Whitson and Manos in 2005 found evidence that supports the &quot;Physalodendron&quot; and &quot;Rydbergis&quot; subgenera. The same research indicated that evidence was weak for most of the recognized species sections within the &quot;Rydbergis&quot; subgenus, but that other subgroupings might be appropriate instead. This and other phylogenic research led to the Whitson proposal in 2016 to establish &quot;Alkekengi officinarum&quot; as the type of a new genus rather than the type species of &quot;Physalis&quot;.

=== Genetics and breeding ===
The basic number for Physalis species is 12, and most Physalis species are diploid with &quot;2n = 24&quot;. This basic number is typical for members of the Solanaceae family. Research has identified several species that have experienced polyploidy, including &quot;Physalis angulata&quot;, &quot;Physalis floridana&quot;, &quot;Physalis pubescens&quot;, and &quot;Physalis peruvania&quot;.

Physalis species are generally self-compatible and autogamous, although some may exhibit self-incompatibility and require pollen from another plant to bear fruit or produce seed. A study in 2022 found self-compatibility for all seven Physalis that were observed, which included Physalis peruviana and Physalis ixocarpa. The same study found that fruit fixation and viable seed formation occurred in most inter-specific crosses. The authors did not grow offspring to the second generation.

Menzel performed crosses between Physalis species to assess hybridization in 1951 which showed that perennial species are prone to hybridization while annual Physalis species exhibited barriers between crossing. Hinton identified natural hybridization events between Physalis virginiana and Physalis heterophylla , which Hinton hypothesized could be the result of self-incompatibility and lack of &quot;Physalis virginiana&quot; pollen. Sullivan reported in 1985 that natural hybridization rarely occurs among four species from the Physalis viscosa complex.

<doc id="1191005" wikidata="Q661622" url="?curid=1191005" title="Roman Hoffstetter">
<text>Roman Hoffstetter (born 24 April 1742, in Laudenbach, near Bad Mergentheim, Holy Roman Empire; died: 21 May (Baker&#x27;s) or June (&quot;New Grove&quot; 2nd) 1815, in Miltenberg-am-Main, Germany; alternative spelling &quot;Romanus Hoffstetter&quot;) was a classical composer and Benedictine monk who also admired Joseph Haydn almost to the point of imitation. Hoffstetter wrote &quot;everything that flows from Haydn&#x27;s pen seems to me so beautiful and remains so imprinted on my memory that I cannot prevent myself now and again from imitating something as well as I can.&quot;

In 1965, the musicologist Alan Tyson (with H.C. Robbins Landon) published the finding that the entire set of six &quot;String Quartets&quot; long-admired as Haydn&#x27;s Op. 3, including the &quot;Andante cantabile&quot; of No. 5 in F Major known as &quot;Haydn&#x27;s Serenade&quot;, were actually by Roman Hoffstetter. Further discoveries have purported to establish Hoffstetter&#x27;s authorship of the first two of the six quartets, but not the other four.

Little is known about his early training or life, though it is likely that he came from a musical family. He was a twin; the other was Johann Urban Alois Hoffstetter, who became director of the Franconian province of the Teutonic Order and also a small-time composer. Hoffstetter took his vows as Pater Romanus at the Benedictine monastery in Amorbach on 5 June 1763, and was ordained a priest on 10 September 1766. He succeeded in due time to the position of &quot;Regens chori&quot; (choir director), also functioning as an organist and on-call parish priest for smaller churches in the Odenwald region, although his principal position at the monastery was as culinary overseer (Küchenmeister). The majority of works written for Amorbach were lost in the dissolution of the monastery library by French forces in 1803. Following the secularization of Amorbach in 1803, Hoffstetter retired – almost completely deaf and blind – to Miltenberg-am-Main with his abbot, Benedikt Kuelsheimer. He died there 12 years later.

Hoffstetter&#x27;s music has the virtue of being memorable, with clear-cut themes that stay in the memory and make it easy to follow the musical development. Besides his string quartets (which have had to be carefully researched for stylistic earmarks that distinguish them clearly from Haydn), Hoffstetter composed at least ten Masses (several of which are preserved at the Archdiocesian Archives in Würzburg), as well as a number of smaller church works, including a lost &quot;Miserere&quot; on which he collaborated with Swedish-German composer Joseph Martin Kraus (1756–1792). The three viola concertos, one of which is actually a double concerto for viola and violoncello, were once offered for sale by the German firm of Breitkopf, but recent research has determined that these were actually composed by Kraus, not Hoffstetter, as the autograph of one of them in the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek clearly shows.

Hoffstetter is best known for his friendship with Kraus, who was born in nearby Miltenberg-am-Main. Their friendship began as early as 1774 and continued through Kraus&#x27;s appointment as court composer to Swedish King Gustav III, and on through to Kraus&#x27;s death. Hoffstetter corresponded with both Kraus, and his early biographer, Swedish diplomat Fredrik Samuel Silverstolpe, who put him in touch with his idol, Haydn. Nine of these letters, written in 1800 to 1802, have been preserved in Silverstolpe&#x27;s collection at Uppsala University library. [Unverricht, H. &quot;Die Beide Hoffstetter,&quot; 1968]

<doc id="1191013" wikidata="Q1848445" url="?curid=1191013" title="New Philosophers">
<text>The New Philosophers () is the generation of French philosophers who are united by their respective breaks from Marxism in the early 1970s. They also criticized the highly influential thinker Jean-Paul Sartre and the concept of post-structuralism, as well as the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.

They include Alain Finkielkraut, André Glucksmann, Pascal Bruckner, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Jean-Marie Benoist, Christian Jambet, Guy Lardreau, Claude Gandelman, Jean-Paul Dollé and Gilles Susong.

==Beginnings==
The term was created by Bernard-Henri Lévy in 1976. Most of the philosophers he included in that description had a previous history of Marxism with which they had recently broken. Several had been members of the Maoist party Gauche prolétarienne. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s writings on &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; had a profound effect upon many of these former Marxists. Besides the content of the book, French Communist Party’s attack on the book further incited discontent with Marxism. International events, such as massacre in Cambodia and Vietnamese refugee crisis, also inspired criticism and reflections regarding communism.

==Basic characteristics==
The New Philosophers rejected what they saw as the power-worship of the Left, a tradition which they traced back to at least Hegel and Karl Marx in the 1700s and 1800s. They argued that these and other various &quot;master thinkers&quot; who sought to create comprehensive systems of thought had actually created the foundations for systems of oppression. More recently Pascal Bruckner has targeted multiculturalism.

==Heterogeneity==
Because they are defined by a negative quality (i.e., the rejection of systems of authoritarian power) the New Philosophers are very disparate. In 1978, Michael Ryan argued that they exist in name only; their &quot;homogeneity derives from their espousal of heterogeneity.&quot; They have been described as &quot;a brand name&quot; for an &quot;extremely heterogeneous group of about ten intellectuals who are held together more from without than from within... they do not serve as representatives of any clearly defined political movement or force.&quot;

==Criticism==
They were attacked as superficial and ideological by critics such as Gilles Deleuze, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Pierre Bourdieu, Alain Badiou, Jean-François Lyotard, and Cornelius Castoriadis.

<doc id="1191018" wikidata="Q5317343" url="?curid=1191018" title="Dutch Masters (cigar)">
<text>Dutch Masters is an American brand of natural wrapped cigars that has been sold since 1912. Its distinctive packaging features Rembrandt&#x27;s 1662 painting &quot;Syndics of the Drapers&#x27; Guild&quot;. Dutch Masters cigars are currently manufactured and sold by Imperial Brands. They are machine-rolled cigars and come in two varieties: standard cigars and smaller cigarillos. Dutch Masters are a common choice for cannabis smokers who like to roll blunts.

G.H. Johnson Cigar Company was the original producer of the Dutch Masters cigar brand. The brand became a mainstay of the Consolidated Cigar Corporation, which merged the G.H. Johnson Cigar Company and six others in 1921. The Consolidated Cigar Corp. later became part of Altadis, formed in 1999 by a merger of the French and Spanish state tobacco monopolies. 

Dutch Masters became well-known in the late 1950s and early 1960s for its sponsorship of comedian Ernie Kovacs. (Kovacs, a well known cigar smoker, never smoked Dutch Masters off camera, sticking almost exclusively to Havana cigars.)

In 2015, Dutch Masters sponsored wrap parties hosted by Cipha Sounds and Drewski, The MVMT.

<text>The Director of National Service or Minister of National Service was a post that existed briefly in the British government. Although a political appointment, the initial holder was Neville Chamberlain who was not a Member of Parliament at the time.

<doc id="1191021" wikidata="Q7531880" url="?curid=1191021" title="Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali">
<text>Tun Dr. Siti Hasmah binti Haji Mohamad Ali (Jawi: سيتي حسمه بنت محمد علي; born 12 July 1926) is a Malaysian doctor and former chancellor of the Multimedia University (MMU). She is married to Mahathir Mohamad, the 4th and 7th Prime Minister of Malaysia. She is the oldest-living spouse of a prime minister of Malaysia. In Malaysia, Siti Hasmah is respectfully known as Ibu Negara (Mother of the Nation).

As a doctor in Kedah, she actively promoted public and rural health by organizing initiatives to improve hygiene, encourage healthy lifestyles, and provide immunizations for children.

==Early life==

Siti Hasmah was born on 12 July 1926 in Klang, Selangor, as an ethnic Malay (retired) physician of Minangkabau descent from Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Siti Hasmah&#x27;s father, Haji Mohd Ali, was a government officer, while her mother, Hajah Siti Khatijah binti Ahmad, was a housewife. 

Siti Hasmah, the sixth of ten siblings, hails from a family distinguished by significant contributions to Malaysia&#x27;s development. Her elder brother, Ismail Mohamed Ali, served as the second Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia from 1962 to 1980 and was the inaugural chairman of Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB). Another brother, General (Rtd) Mohamed Hashim Mohd Ali, held the position of Chief of Defence Forces from 1987 to 1992. Additionally, her brother Ahmad Razali Mohd Ali was the 10th Menteri Besar of Selangor, and her sister, Saleha Mohd Ali, was instrumental in the founding of UMNO and was a prominent figure in Malaysia&#x27;s medical community.

Siti Hasmah schooled in SMK St. Mary. She obtained her MBBS from the University of Malaya in Singapore. She was one of the first Malay women to enroll for a medical course at the King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore (now the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine).

In 1955 she graduated as a medical doctor from the Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, which was then located in Singapore. She subsequently joined the government health service. She was one of the first Malay woman doctors in then Malaya.

Siti Hasmah achieved several firsts at the Ministry of Health, including being the first woman in Malaysia to serve as a medical officer in the Maternal and Child Health Department in 1965. In 1966, she attended a public health certificate program at the School of Public Health, the University of Michigan.

In 1974, she was the first woman to be appointed State Maternal and Child Health Officer in Kedah. During her tenure, Siti Hasmah successfully reduced the infant mortality rate from 75 per 1,000 to only 6 per 1,000.

She is also the author of several articles on family medicine and the socioeconomic factors associated with pregnancy and childbearing in Malaysia. Additionally, Siti Hasmah had once served as a lecturer at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya.

==Spouse of the Prime Minister of Malaysia==

Siti Hasmah used her position as the wife of the Prime Minister to advocate for women&#x27;s health, family planning, drug abuse control, and adult literacy. She also served in various positions as follows:

* President of the Malaysian Girl Guides Association
* Chairman of the Kedah Family Planning Association
* President of the Malaysian Medical Association Foundation
* President of the Association for the Rehabilitation of Handicapped Children
* Vice-President of the Federation of Family Planning Associations of Malaysia
* Patron of the Malaysian Association of Maternal Health and Neonate
* Patron of the Malaysian Pediatric Association
* Patron of the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM)

As Patron of the Pan Pacific South Asia Women&#x27;s Association, (PPSEAWA) Malaysia, Siti Hasmah attended and presented keynote addresses at the Triennial Conferences in Tokyo (1984), Bangkok (1991) and Tonga (1994). She also once served as the first Chancellor of Multimedia University (MMU) for 15 years, from 1997 to 2012.

Siti Hasmah played a key role in bringing Malaysia and its women into the international spotlight. She met and held discussions with prominent figures, including Nancy Reagan, wife of U.S. President Ronald Reagan; Rosalynn Carter, wife of U.S. President Jimmy Carter; Queen Fabiola of Belgium; Queen Noor of Jordan; Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom; and Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whom she had once engaged with in diplomatic conversations.

In September 1995, Siti Hasmah led the Malaysian delegation to the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, where she delivered a speech titled “Equality, Development and Peace: A Caring World”.

In August 1999, a man attempted to ram a government vehicle carrying Siti Hasmah, but was intercepted by security personnel and eventually apprehended.

In March 2000, Siti Hasmah led a Malaysian delegation on a five-day goodwill visit to Iraq to assess the impact of economic sanctions on women and children. The delegation visited hospitals, orphanages, and old folks&#x27; homes, bringing essential medical supplies. During the trip, she met Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and was later invited for a brief meeting with President Saddam Hussein. She later recalled that the meeting was kept secret until it occurred, even from her security team and Mahathir, and that during their conversation, Saddam expressed gratitude to Malaysia for its support in efforts to lift the sanctions.

In October 2003, before her tenure as the wife of the Prime Minister ended, Siti Hasmah chaired the First Ladies Dialogue on &quot;Women, Peace, and Development&quot; during the 10th Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Summit. The dialogue focused on women&#x27;s roles in nation-building, and a 10-point resolution was submitted to promote sustainable development and gender equity.

Siti Hasmah again served as the wife of the prime minister after her husband was reappointed on 10 May 2018. Later in November, she launched Malaysia&#x27;s first 24-hour bookstore, BookXcess Cyberjaya, where she signed a plaque inscribed with the words: ‘A book warrior and a true believer in the power of reading’.

==Social contributions==

===Drug abuse===
As the President of BAKTI (Welfare Club of the Wives of Ministers and Deputy Ministers), Siti Hasmah actively participated in initiatives to raise awareness among young people about the dangers of drug abuse. In 1985, she accepted an invitation from United States First Lady Nancy Reagan to attend the First Ladies&#x27; Conference on Drug Abuse in Washington D.C.. Two years later, in 1987, she represented Malaysia at the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna.

===Rural women===
Siti Hasmah was also active internationally in promoting the cause of rural women. In 1992, at the invitation of Queen Fabiola of Belgium, she attended the First Ladies Summit for the Economic Advancement of Rural Women in Geneva. She was chosen as one of the six Core-Group Initiators of First Ladies representing the Asia-Pacific Region.

In February 1994, Siti Hasmah participated in the ISC Council Meeting held in Brussels. The following year, in September 1995, she was named Chairperson of the Regional Steering Committee on the Economic Advancement of Rural and Island Women for the Asia-Pacific region. By November 1996, she had assumed the role of president.

===Mental health===
Being a medical doctor by training, Siti Hasmah also has an interest in mental health. Former First Lady of the United States, Rosalynn Carter invited Siti Hasmah to serve on the National Committee of the World Federation of Mental Health which Carter chaired.
==Personal life==
In August 1956, Siti Hasmah married Mahathir Mohamad. They have seven children: Marina, Mirzan, Melinda, Mokhzani, Mukhriz, Maizura, and Mazhar. Their son Mukhriz served twice as the Menteri Besar of Kedah, from 2013 to 2016 and again from 2018 to 2020. In Siti Hasmah&#x27;s 2016 memoir, &quot;My Name is Hasmah&quot;, she described Mahathir as her &#x27;hero&#x27; who supported her throughout her studies, particularly when she struggled with Physics and Chemistry. She also referred to Mahathir as her &#x27;boy from the Paddy Fields State&#x27;, a nickname highlighting his origins from Kedah.

Known to be a loving person, Siti Hasmah is a cat lover and music enthusiast. She began learning the violin at 16 but stopped after a few years, only to resume playing more than 70 years later. By 2018, her violin was auctioned for RM35,000 to support Pakatan Harapan’s campaign for the 14th General Election. Additionally, in her 70s, she dedicated herself to learning French and successfully passed the examinations. In December 2015, Siti Hasmah learned to play a new instrument, the erhu.

Siti Hasmah often accompanied Mahathir on official visits and holidays, starting with their first trip to Japan in 1961. Over the years, she has traveled to nearly every country, including remote islands and Antarctica, with Afghanistan being the only exception. Japan remains their favorite holiday destination. Siti Hasmah once mentioned that she watched &quot;Star Wars&quot; with Mahathir in Houston, US.

In March 2019, Siti Hasmah underwent surgery to remove a small lump in her left breast after a mammogram and biopsy confirmed its presence. After recovering, she shared her experience of undergoing breast cancer treatment during the Kuala Lumpur-level Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign, urging women to prioritize early screening and treatment.

On 26 August 2019, Siti Hasmah was admitted to Prince Court Medical Centre due to mild food poisoning. She had been scheduled to accompany Mahathir on his three-day official visit to Vietnam. While in Hanoi, Mahathir assured reporters that her condition had improved and expressed his intention to visit her upon returning to Kuala Lumpur, saying, “I miss her… we have been married for 60 years.” After three days of treatment, Siti Hasmah was discharged from the hospital on 29 August.

On 27 October 2024, Siti Hasmah revealed in an interview on the Coffee with Ryan podcast that her original name did not include &quot;Siti&quot;. She explained that the prefix was added in the 1970s when she was appointed as a medical officer, as &quot;Siti&quot; was a popular trend at the time. She requested that people no longer use &quot;Siti&quot; before her name.

Siti Hasmah is also the honorary advisor of the Perdana Global Peace Foundation (PGPF).

<text>The Division of Dawson is an Australian electoral division in Queensland. It covers areas around the city of Mackay. The current MP is Andrew Willcox of the National Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The Division of Dawson includes the city of Mackay, as well as other neighbouring towns. It also includes the Whitsunday Islands.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named after Anderson Dawson, the first Labor Premier of Queensland and leader of the first parliamentary socialist government anywhere in the world. It is located on the North Queensland coast, taking in the towns of Ayr, Bowen, Mackay, Proserpine and some south-eastern suburbs of the city of Townsville.

Apart from a period from 1966 to 1975 and 2007 to 2010, it has been held by the National Party. While Mackay, the largest city wholly within the electorate, is a longstanding Labor stronghold, it is usually not enough to overcome the region&#x27;s overall conservative leaning.

<doc id="1191027" wikidata="Q688523" url="?curid=1191027" title="LHC@home">
<text>LHC@home is a volunteer computing project researching particle physics that uses the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) platform. The project&#x27;s computing power is utilized by physicists at CERN in support of the Large Hadron Collider and other experimental particle accelerators.

The project is run with the help of over 1,260 active volunteer users contributing more than 3,000 computers processing at a combined 52 teraFLOPS . The project is cross-platform, and runs on a variety of computer hardware configurations.

==Applications==
The LHC@home project currently runs four applications—Atlas, CMS, SixTrack, and Test4Theory—which deal with different aspects of research conducted in LHC such as calculating particle beam stability and simulating proton collisions. Atlas, CMS, and Test4Theory use VirtualBox, an x86 virtualization software package.

===Atlas===
&quot;Atlas&quot; uses volunteer computing power to run simulations of the ATLAS experiment. It can be run in VirtualBox or natively on Linux.

===Beauty===
&quot;Beauty&quot; (LHCb) compared the decay of bottom quarks () and bottom antiquarks (), which also known as &quot;beauty quarks&quot;. The participation of volunteers in the application was suspended indefinitely on 19 November 2018.

===CMS===
The &quot;CMS&quot; application (formerly a standalone project called &quot;CMS@Home&quot;) allows users to run simulations for the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment on their computers.

===SixTrack===
&quot;SixTrack&quot; was first introduced as a beta on 1 September 2004 and a record 1000 users signed up within 24 hours. The application went public, with a 5000 user limit, on September 29 to commemorate CERN&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Currently there is no user limit and qualification.

&quot;SixTrack&quot; was developed by Frank Schmidt of the CERN Accelerators and Beams Department and produces results that are essential for verifying the long term stability of the high energy particles in the LHC. Lyn Evans, head of the LHC project, stated that &quot;the results from SixTrack are really making a difference, providing us with new insights into how the LHC will perform&quot;.

===Test4Theory===
The &quot;Test4Theory&quot; application allows volunteers to run simulations of high energy particle collisions on their home computers. These simulations use theoretical models based on the Standard Model of particle physics, and are calculated using Monte Carlo methods. The theoretical models have adjustable parameters and the aim is that a given set of parameters (called a &quot;tune&quot;) will fit the widest possible range of experimental results.

The Test4Theory results are therefore submitted to a database which contains a very wide set of experimental data from many accelerator experiments worldwide, including of course experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. The Theory Unit at CERN runs the MCPLots project, which run the database and the theoretical fitting process.

<text>The second USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot; was a wooden sloop-of-war in the United States Navy in service during the mid-to-late 19th century. She was designed by Josiah Barker on the lines of a French-built privateer, and built at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, directly across the Piscataqua River from Portsmouth, New Hampshire. She was described as an improvement over built in the same shipyard a year earlier. &quot;Portsmouth&quot; was launched on 23 October 1843 and commissioned on 10 November 1844, with Commander John Berrien Montgomery in command.

==Service history==
===Mexican–American War, 1845–1848===
&quot;Portsmouth&quot; had an important role during the Mexican–American War, seizing the port of Yerba Buena (today&#x27;s San Francisco) from Mexico. She had set sail on 25 January 1845 from Norfolk, Virginia, on a cruise around Cape Horn to join the Pacific Squadron under the command of Commodore John D. Sloat. En route, she made stops in Rio de Janeiro, Valparaiso, Callao, the Sandwich Islands, and Acapulco. Upon arriving off the Departamento de Las Californias coast, with Lieutenant Benjamin F. B. Hunter as her Sailing Master, she was initially engaged in watching the movements of British vessels there to prevent the possibility of Great Britain acquiring the region during any conflict between the U.S. and Mexico.

After the declaration of war with Mexico, a detachment of Marines under the command of Second Lieutenant Henry Bulls Watson rowed ashore on 9 July 1846, marched to the pueblo&#x27;s main plaza, and raised the American flag, thereby seizing the city. Renamed Portsmouth Square, the site is located in modern Chinatown. In the square there is a US Flag flown from a flagpole and a commemorative plaque set by the Daughters of the American Revolution.

&quot;Portsmouth&quot; remained in San Francisco Bay until November 1846, when she was sent to San Diego. During 1847, under the command of Montgomery, she was assigned to blockade Mexico&#x27;s west coast, arriving with USS &quot;Congress&quot; and USS &quot;Argo&quot; at Guaymas on 17 October. After a request to surrender was rejected the ships began a bombardment of the city, lasting an hour. After the town surrendered a garrison was sent ashore and occupied the city. Her duty completed by early 1848, she got underway for the cruise back to the U.S. east coast on the morning of 3 January.

===West Africa, 1848–1851===
Returning to Boston in May 1848 she departed again on 29 August and sailed east to the African coast. There until 1 February 1849 she patrolled with Royal Navy ships to suppress the slave trade. Between September 1849 and May 1851 she again cruised off the West African coast, returning to Boston on 26 June.

===Pacific, Africa, 1851–1861===

Six months later &quot;Portsmouth&quot; left Boston for duty in the Pacific. On 5 April 1855 she returned to the east coast for overhaul at Norfolk, and on 3 May 1856 got underway for the Pacific again. Under Commander Andrew H. Foote she reached Batavia 94 days later, whence she sailed to China. There she participated in the engagement with the Barrier Forts of Canton on 16–22 November 1856. Ordered home in January 1858, she returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and remained there until sailing for Africa again for a three-year tour, 1859–1861.

===Civil War, 1861–1865===
Following the onset of the Civil War, &quot;Portsmouth&quot; home-ported and refitted between September and December 1861, then sailed for the Gulf of Mexico and duty with the Gulf Blockading Squadron. By the end of February 1862 she had captured two blockade runners off Texas. In April she participated in operations against Forts Jackson and St. Philip, then from May 1862 to August 1865 operated as station ship at New Orleans.

===South America, Pacific, 1865–1878===
Continuing her varied career after peace was restored, &quot;Portsmouth&quot; served as quarantine vessel at New York, 1866–67; cruised off Brazil and Africa, 1869–71; carried relief personnel to Brazil in early 1872; and participated in survey assignments in the eastern Pacific, 1873–74. This included a stop at the Palmyra Atoll for several days, arriving there on 11 December 1873. Ship&#x27;s surgeon William H. Jones performed a survey of the animal and plant life, as well as creating a detailed map of the atoll&#x27;s islets and lagoons. In 1875 she conducted a cruise off the west coast of Latin America and on 14 July 1878 was decommissioned as a cruiser and assigned as a training ship for boys. On 25 July 1876 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Alexander Parker attempted to rescue a shipmate from drowning, for which he was later awarded a Medal of Honor.

===Training ship, 1878–1915===
In 1878 &quot;Portsmouth&quot; returned to the east coast, arriving at Washington, D.C., on 16 February. In March she sailed to France, returning in December to resume training ship duties on 17 January 1895, first with naval apprentices, then with the New Jersey Naval Militia, until March 1911. Three of her crewman earned the Medal of Honor during this period for jumping overboard to rescue fellow sailors: Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Francis Moore on 23 January 1882, and Seaman Henry C. Courtney and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Thomas Cramen on 7 February 1882. &quot;Portsmouth&quot; was then loaned to the Public Health Service, Quarantine Station, Charleston, South Carolina to serve as a boarding launch. She was struck from the Navy List on 17 April 1915 and subsequently sold.

&quot;Portsmouth&quot; was taken to Governors Island, Boston Harbor, and burned on the night of 6–7 September 1915, the culmination of a South Boston carnival. The event was well attended by politicians and others, and a fireboat siren shrieked a salute as flames poured out of her empty gun ports.

==Bank of America logo==

The Portsmouth was adopted as the logo for the San Francisco-founded Bank of America by its founder, Amadeo Giannini, in recognition of the ship&#x27;s role in securing the city. Service pins issued to employees by the bank not only feature the ship&#x27;s image, but include its name inscribed beneath..
The ship&#x27;s helm was removed during decommissioning and was on display in the headquarter&#x27;s reception area in 1995.

==Hoboken Civil War Memorial==
&quot;Portsmouth&quot; served in the New Jersey Naval Militia in the early 1900s. Two Dahlgren guns from her are part of the Hoboken Civil War Memorial located at Stevens Park in Hoboken.

<text>In theoretical physics and quantum physics, a graviphoton or gravivector is a hypothetical particle which emerges as an excitation of the metric tensor (i.e. gravitational field) in spacetime dimensions higher than four, as described in Kaluza–Klein theory.
However, its crucial physical properties are analogous to a (massive) photon: it induces a &quot;vector force&quot;, sometimes dubbed a &quot;fifth force&quot;. The electromagnetic potential formula_1 emerges from an extra component of the metric tensor formula_2, where the figure 5 labels an additional, fifth dimension.

In gravity theories with extended supersymmetry (extended supergravities), a graviphoton is normally a superpartner of the graviton that behaves like a photon, and is prone to couple with gravitational strength, as was appreciated in the late 1970s. Unlike the graviton, it may provide a &quot;repulsive&quot; (as well as an attractive) force, and thus, in some technical sense, a type of anti-gravity. Under special circumstances, in several natural models, often descending from five-dimensional theories mentioned, it may actually cancel the gravitational attraction in the static limit. Joël Scherk investigated semirealistic aspects of this phenomenon, stimulating searches for physical manifestations of this mechanism.

<text>The Cane Corso is an Italian breed of mastiff. It is usually kept as a companion dog or guard dog; it may also be used to protect livestock. In the past it was used for hunting large game, and also to herd cattle.

== History ==

According to the breed standard of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, the Cane Corso was once distributed throughout much of the Italian peninsula, but in the recent past was found only in Puglia, in southern Italy. After the collapse of the &quot;mezzadria&quot; system of share-cropping in the 1960s, the dogs became rare. The modern breed derives from selective breeding from about 1980 of a few surviving animals. 

A breed society, the Società Amatori Cane Corso, was formed in 1983. The breed was recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana in 1994; it was provisionally accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1996, and received full acceptance in 2007. It was recognised by the American Kennel Club of the United States in 2010.

In the period 2011–2019 the number of annual registrations in Italy was in the range of .

== Characteristics ==

The Cane Corso is a large dog of molossoid type, and is closely related to the Neapolitan Mastiff. It is well muscled and less bulky than most other mastiff breeds. According to the international standard, dogs should stand some at the withers and weigh ; bitches are about smaller, and weigh some less.

The head is large, slightly over one third of the height at the withers in length, with a well-defined stop. The top of the cranium is flat and slightly convergent to the muzzle. The eyes are oval in shape, and set well apart. The iris of the eye should be as dark as possible.

The coat is short, dense and lustrous. It may be black, various shades of grey (lead-grey, light grey or slate-grey) or fawn (dark fawn, light fawn, or stag red), or dark wheaten (&quot;); it may be brindled. Minor white markings on the chest, the feet or the nose are tolerated.

The Cane Corso is genetically pre-disposed to elbow and hip dysplasia, to patellar luxation and to retinal dysplasia. It has above-average susceptibility to demodicosis, ectropion, entropion, gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), hypothyroidism, idiopathic epilepsy, mycotic otitis and nictitans gland prolapse (cherry eye).

In 2017 a study of 232 Cane Corso dogs from 25 countries found an average life span of 9.3 years, varying with different coat colours. The longest-lived were black brindle (10.3 years), followed by: brindle (10.1 years); grey brindle (9.8 years); black, fawn and grey (all 9.0 years); and dogs of other colours (8.1 years). A study of dogs in the United Kingdom, published in 2024, found an average life span for the breed of 8.1 years overall. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 9 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

== Use ==

The Cane Corso is usually kept as a companion dog or guard dog; it may also be used to protect livestock. In the past it was used for hunting large game, and also to herd cattle.

It is subject to a working trial: in order to qualify for registration, dogs must show tranquillity in the presence of inoffensive strangers, indifference to gunfire, and aggressive defence of the owner against an attacker.

<text>The British Rail Class 165 &quot;Networker Turbo&quot; is a fleet of suburban diesel-hydraulic multiple unit passenger trains (DMUs), originally specified by and built for the British Rail Thames and Chiltern Division of Network SouthEast. They were built by BREL York Works between 1990 and 1992. An express version was subsequently built in the form of the Class 166 &quot;Networker Turbo Express&quot; trains. Both classes are now referred to as &quot;Networker Turbos&quot;, a name derived some three years later for the project that resulted in the visually similar and EMUs.

The class is still in service, now operated by Great Western Railway and by Chiltern Railways. When operated originally by Network SouthEast, along with that operator&#x27;s Class 166 trains, the Paddington suburban units were initially known as Thames Turbos, while the units operated on the Marylebone suburban network were known as Chiltern Turbos.

==Description==
Externally, the class 165 can be distinguished from a Class 166 by the opening hoppers on every other window.

===Class 165/0===
Thirty-nine Class 165/0 Networker trains were built in 1990–91, in two batches, for the Chiltern subdivision of Network SouthEast, numbered 165001–039. Both 2-car and 3-car variants were built. Initially, thirty-three units were ordered (comprising the vehicles that made up units 165001-165022 and 165029–165039) but an additional order was placed for a further six units (165023-028). Units 165001-028 were delivered consecutively, as 2-car units, whilst units 165029-039 were delivered as 3-car units. These vehicles have a top speed of . They are now all fitted with tripcocks for working over the London Underground lines between Amersham and Harrow-on-the-Hill, although upon delivery this equipment was only fitted to 165006–028. Automatic Train Protection is also fitted, making them one of the few classes to have both these features in Britain.

Each unit was formed of two outer driving motors, with an additional intermediate motor in the 3-car units. The technical description of the formation is DMOSL+MOS+DMOS. Individual carriages are numbered as follows:
*58801-58833 (units 165001-022/029-039) and 58873-58878 (units 165023–028) - DMOSL
*55404-55414 (units 165029–039) - MOS
*58834-58866 (units 165001-022/029-039) and 58867-58872 (units 165023–028) - DMOS

===Class 165/1===

Thirty-seven Class 165/1 Networker trains were built in 1992 for the &quot;Thames line&quot; subdivision of Network SouthEast, numbered 165101–137. Like the &quot;Chiltern&quot; units, both 2-car and 3-car variants were built. Units 165101-117 were delivered as 3-car units, followed by the 2-car units 165118–137. They are regeared and fitted with bogie yaw dampers to allow a top speed of , more suitable for mainline use.

Each unit was formed of two outer driving motors, with an additional intermediate motor in the 3-car units. The technical description of the formation is DMOCL+MOS+DMOS. Although still listed on the vehicle data sheets at DMCL vehicles, the first-class area has been removed from 2-car 165s operated by GWR. As such these vehicles are now technically DMOSL vehicles. The 3-car units were similarly declassified, but the first-class accommodation has now been reinstated on these. Individual carriages are numbered as follows:
*58953-58969 - DMCL
*58879-58898 - DMOSL changed from DMCL in 2015
*55415-55431 - MOS
*58916-58932 and 58933-58952 - DMOS

Unit 165115 was destroyed in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash.

==Accidents and incidents==

*Ladbroke Grove rail crash: On 5 October 1999, unit 165115 passed a signal at danger while leaving London Paddington on a Thames Trains service. This resulted in a serious collision with a London-bound HST service. 31 people were killed (24 of them on board the Class 165, the leading coach of which was completely destroyed by the impact) and 417 were injured.
*On 30 June 2005, unit 165037 was approaching the Gerrards Cross Tunnel, which was under construction, when the driver realised that the line was blocked. An emergency stop was made and the train came to a halt before the tunnel, which had partially collapsed. The train returned wrong line to where the passengers were detrained.
*On 16 June 2016, unit 165124 was derailed by a set of trap points at after passing a signal at danger, causing significant disruption to services. The driver&#x27;s assistant&#x27;s side of the cab was destroyed after the train hit a stanchion that holds up the overhead catenary after derailing. The vehicle was moved after two days in position at Paddington to Old Oak Common Depot to be taken away by road for assessment and repair work.
*Unit 165128 was in service as a hybrid unit with 58609 (MOS vehicle from 166209) inserted in the middle from November 2015 until May 2016. This was due to one of its driving vehicles being damaged in an engine fire on the North Downs line in November 2015, rendering it out of service, and so to provide another 3-car train in service.
*On 21 June 2020, units 165015 and 165006 formed a passenger train that passed a signal at danger (a SPAD) and was in danger of colliding head-on with a passenger train formed of London Underground S stock at . The two trains stopped apart. Driver fatigue was found to be the cause of the SPAD.

==Operations==

=== Chiltern Railways ===

The 165/0 units were originally delivered in Network SouthEast livery for used on routes including fast services from London Marylebone to Princes Risborough and Banbury and local services from Aylesbury to London and Princes Risborough. In this role they replaced the DMUs. They were later used further afield, when Chiltern services were extended to serve Leamington Spa, Warwick, Solihull and Birmingham Snow Hill / Birmingham Moor Street railway station.

In December 1993, due to a downturn in traffic as a result of the recession, units 165001-007 were transferred from the Chiltern lines of Network SouthEast to the Thames lines (from Aylesbury to Reading depots). All vehicles had their tripcock equipment removed before transfer. The following year, unit 165007 was returned to the Chiltern lines, followed by 165006 in 1995. Due to unavailability of tripcock equipment upon their return, the units were coupled cab-to-cab and operated for some months between the vehicles of other units as semi-permanently formed four-car units - until tripcock equipment became available, allowing them to be restored to operational two-car units. Following privatisation, two former Chiltern units (165003 and 165005) were repainted into Thames Trains livery. Chiltern Railways inherited 34 Class 165/0 units from Network SouthEast, and the remaining five were returned from Thames Trains in 2004 - leaving Chiltern Railways operating the whole subclass.

After privatisation they continued to work similar services as before but, with the arrival of the faster Class 168 &quot;Clubman&quot; units, the 165 &quot;Turbo&quot; trains were displaced and are now found less often on expresses to Birmingham, generally working on shorter routes such as stopping services to Aylesbury, High Wycombe, and Stratford-upon-Avon and also the Birmingham Moor Street - Leamington Spa local services.

A new depot was built at Aylesbury in 1990/1991 for the maintenance of these trains and has been enlarged since British Rail days, with the addition of a wheel lathe. Light maintenance and refuelling is carried out at Wembley LMD and Tyseley TMD, and units can occasionally be found at Stourbridge LMD. Units are also regularly stabled in the Marylebone station environs, Aylesbury South Sidings and at Banbury, where a further depot is currently under construction at the south end of the station on the western side of the line.

All Chiltern units were refurbished between late 2003 and early 2005. Air conditioning was added and the opening hopper windows replaced with sealed units. A new passenger information system, similar to that on the Class 168 &quot;Clubman&quot; trains, CCTV cameras and an area designated for the use of wheelchair users were added and the first-class section was removed, as Chiltern became a standard-class-only railway in 2003. The original 3+2 seating at the outer ends of the driving vehicles was replaced by new 2+2 high-back seating. The existing 3+2 low-back seating was retained in the centre areas of the driving vehicles and throughout the centre vehicles of the three-car units. A cycle/wheelchair area with tip-up seats was also added to each unit. A further refurbishment began in 2015, concentrating on the toilet areas, to make these units fully 
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA)-compliant for operation beyond 2020.

They can often be found on the Aylesbury to London Marylebone routes including the Princes Risborough shuttle.

===Great Western Railway===

==== Thames Valley ====
The Class 165/1 fleet were built for local services from along the Great Western Main Line; their main destinations included local trains to , , , , Oxford, and , and services along the branch lines to , , and .

Following the privatisation of British Rail, the franchise was won by the Go-Ahead Group, who operated it as Thames Trains from 1996 to 2004 and inherited all the Class 165/1 &quot;Turbo&quot; trains as well as the first five Class 165/0 &quot;Turbo&quot; trains that had been transferred from the Chiltern lines. In April 2004, operation of the Thames Trains franchise passed to First Great Western Link. In 2004, due to deliveries of new Class 180 &quot;Adelante&quot; units on sister company First Great Western, the five Class 165/0 &quot;Turbo&quot; units became redundant and were transferred to Chiltern Railways.

In January 2010, First Great Western announced an £8 million refurbishment programme for its fleet of Classes 165 and 166 Turbo DMU trains:
* seats re-trimmed
* interiors repainted 
* Passenger Information Displays replaced with a GPS-based system
* upgraded lavatory facilities
* flooring stripped and replaced

In 2012, First Great Western took delivery of Class 180 &quot;Adelante&quot; units for Cotswold Line services, and three-car &quot;Sprinter&quot; units for Reading to Basingstoke Line services, allowing Class 165 and 166 units to be used to reinforce Thames Valley services.

In late 2015, as part of the rebranding to GWR, the Class 165 fleet had all first-class sections removed to increase capacity.

Following the electrification of the Great Western Main Line up to Didcot Parkway, as well as the Reading-Taunton line as far as Newbury, services between London Paddington and Didcot Parkway, as well as between Reading and Newbury, have been operated by new Class 387 electric multiple units, allowing much of the existing Class 165 fleet to move to the Bristol area. Class 165s continue to service the aforementioned branch lines, but no longer run to London Paddington except during peak hours.

==== Bristol area ====

Following the transfer of the 166 units to St Philip&#x27;s Marsh depot in July 2017, some of the 165 services have since followed on with the first 165 operating in the Bristol area in July 2018. Since then and alongside the 166s, they have rapidly been introduced on other services such as the Weston-super-Mare to Filton Abbey Wood (now Weston-super-Mare / Bristol Temple Meads to Severn Beach / Filton Abbey Wood) services, the Cardiff Central to Taunton services, the Golden Valley Line, the Heart of Wessex Line and also some services on the Wessex Main Line as far as Warminster and Southampton Central. In January 2019, they began operating the regional service between Cardiff Central and Portsmouth Harbour which allowed more of the Class 158 units that solely operated this service to move more west.

The transfer of the 165 (and 166) units to services in and around Bristol and Exeter have overall allowed units that previously operated these services to move further west, such as the Class 150 and Class 158 units. More so than the 166 units, a lot of the 165 units remain to be based at Reading TMD where they continue to operate Thames Valley services.

==Fleet details==


==Named units==
Some units have been named these are as follows:
*165119 &quot;Norman Topson MBE&quot;
*165120 &quot;Roger Watkins The GWR master train planner&quot;

==Hybrid powertrain==
It was reported in September 2018 that Angel Trains was to convert class 165 units for Chiltern Railways to hybrid diesel and battery-powered trains.

In April 2020, two-car unit 165004 was sent to LORAM rail at Derby for HyDrive conversion.

In August 2023 it was announced that the project had been abandoned.

<text>Brigadier-General Wallace Duffield Wright, (20 September 1875 – 25 March 1953) was a British soldier and politician. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Wright, the son of James Sykes Wright, was born in Gibraltar on 20 September 1875. He was educated at
Cranbrook School, Kent. He joined the Militia in 1893, and was commissioned into the 1st Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) in December 1896.

Wright served with the Malakand Field Force and the Tirah Expeditionary Force on the North West Frontier (1897–1898), during which he was severely wounded. He was awarded the India Medal with clasps for the Punjab Frontier and Tirah and was promoted to Lieutenant in September 1898.

==Victoria Cross action==
In 1901 Wright was sent to North Nigeria, where he was attached to the Northern Nigeria Regiment, during Kano-Sokoto Expedition in Northern Nigeria.

==Later military career==
From 1904 to 1914 Wright held a number of staff positions.

During the First World War he served in the Kamerun campaign in Central Africa from 1914–15 and in France from 1915–19, becoming a major in 1915, brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1916 and a colonel in 1919. He was then a staff officer in the British Army of the Rhine from 1923–26 and commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade at Plymouth, 1925–27.

He retired with the honorary rank of brigadier general in 1927. In retirement he joined the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms and served in the Home Guard from 1940. 

==As Member of Parliament==
In 1928, Wright was elected at a by-election as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Tavistock following the death of the sitting MP Philip Kenyon-Slaney. He was re-elected at the 1929 general election, but stood down at the 1931 general election.

He died at Chobham, Surrey, on 25 March 1953, aged 77.

==Honours and awards==
His VC was destroyed in the fire at The Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment Museum, Clandon Park, Surrey on 29 April 2015.

<text>Robert Spear Hudson, 1st Viscount Hudson, (15 August 1886 – 2 February 1957) was a British Conservative Party politician who held a number of ministerial posts during World War II.

==Diplomatic career ==
He was the eldest son of Robert William Hudson, who had inherited and then sold the substantial family soap business, and Gerda Frances Marion Bushell. The wealth he inherited from the soap business ensured that Hudson always had a very privileged and well off existence. Hudson was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. He entered the Diplomatic Service in 1911, becoming an attaché and First Secretary at the British embassy in Washington. Hudson afterwards served as a diplomat in Russia. On 1 December 1918, he married a wealthy American woman, Hannah Randolph of Philadelphia, whom he had met during his time as a diplomat in Washington. He had a particular interest in farming and was a member of the council of the Royal Agricultural Society.

==MP==
Hudson was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Whitehaven in 1924 and served there until losing in 1929. In 1931 he was returned for Southport. He served in several ministerial posts, becoming a Privy Counsellor in 1938. From 1937 to 1940, Hudson served as Secretary for Overseas Trade. Hudson was on the right-wing of the Conservative party, being opposed to the &quot;one nation&quot; Conservatives such as Neville Chamberlain. He greatly disliked the coalition National government and frequently advocated that the Conservatives dispose of their Liberal National Party and National Labour allies to create all Tory government. Hudson had a particular dislike of the Liberal National War Secretary Leslie Hore-Belisha whom he intrigued against endlessly as he very much wanted to see Hore-Belisha out of the cabinet. Besides for the coalition National government, Hudson resented the dominance of the &quot;provincial&quot; lawyers and businessmen who made up the majority of the Conservative backbenchers who he felt lacked the necessary vision for Britain&#x27;s future. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote: &quot;Normally a mere parliamentary undersecretary is the lowest, the most cribbed and confined of political figures, whose role is merely to deputise for his minister in answering the less controversial of parliamentary questions...But the Department of Overseas Trade...was unique, a hybrid sub-department nominally responsible to, yet in fact independent of, the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office. In practice, this meant that Hudson was his own master&quot;.

In the spring and summer of 1938, Hudson was deeply involved in talks for an Anglo-German economic agreement. Hudson was especially concerned with coal, at the time a major industry in Britain. Between 1933 and 1937, Britain&#x27;s exports of coal had declined by 20%, mostly because of cheaper German coal from Silesia and the Ruhr, which in turn had been possible by generous state subsidies to German coal mining companies. Hudson favored some sort of an agreement to end Anglo-German trade competition, especially in regards to coal. Hudson wrote that an Anglo-German coal cartel were created then &quot;if such an agreement emerged it would have great possibilities as a stepping stone to political appeasement&quot;.

In October–November 1938, Hudson was involved in renewed talks to improve Anglo-German trade. The main issue in the talks, which broke down, were centered around proposals for joint Anglo-German investment in central Africa. However, the British cabinet, which was starting to become concerned with the increasing German economic domination of eastern Europe, were not willing to accept the German demand that the Balkans and Turkey be assigned to the exclusive economic sphere of influence for the &quot;Reich&quot;. At the same time, Hudson was the lead British negotiator for the Anglo-American trade agreement of 1938. The purpose of the agreement was to reduce the effects of the long Anglo-American trade war that had been started by the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. The State Department had a strong distrust and dislike of Hudson. Jay Pierrepont Moffat, the chief of the State Department&#x27;s Western European bureau, wrote that Hudson was &quot;unfriendly to American interests or at least...unwilling to subordinate immediate British interests with a view of obtaining a broader agreement with us in world trade...he has certainly encouraged the Prime Minister to seek cartel agreements with Germany. He is ready to sacrifice people to pounds sterling&quot;. In Britain, the Anglo-American trade agreement was felt to be unsatisfactory, but given the tensions in Europe and Asia, the agreement was felt to be necessary in order to improve relations with the United States. 

Between 15 and 18 November 1938, King Carol II of Romania paid a state visit to Britain. Carol met his cousin, King George VI along with Chamberlain and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax. During his visit, the king warned that Romania was steadily falling into the German economic sphere of influence, and that he wanted British help to keep Romania out of the German sphere. Carol&#x27;s request for a £30 million loan for Romania was refused by Chamberlain, and all the king obtained was a British promise to buy 200,000 tons of Romanian wheat annually with an option to buy 400,000 more tons of wheat and for an Anglo-Romanian committee to be set up to examine ways to improve Anglo-Romanian trade. Carol&#x27;s visit led to an extended debate in the House of Commons, during which Hudson broke with the government and spoke in favour of closer economic ties with Romania. Hudson argued along with Oliver Stanley, the President of the Board of Trade, that Britain had a vested interest in keeping the Balkans from falling into the German sphere of influence, and that Britain should have done more to take up Carol&#x27;s request for closer Anglo-Romanian economic relations. Reflecting both the financial realities imposed by the costs of rearmament and the order of priorities, the Chamberlain government introduced a bill that was signed into law in February 1939 that committed H.M. government to spend over the next year £10 million in government-backed trade credits to subsidise China; £3 million in trade credits for Iraq and Afghanistan; £1 million in trade credits for Portugal and another £1 million in trade credits for Egypt. The largest sum was allocated to China whose economy had been badly strained by the war with Japan. From the British perspective, subsidising China was in their best interest because as long as Japan was bogged down in the war against China, it was less likely that Japan would try to seize Britain&#x27;s Asian colonies. For the Balkans, £2 million in trade credits were allocated for Greece (the location of Greece aside the main shipping lane to the Suez canal made it crucial from the British viewpoint) and only £1 million in trade credits were allocated for Romania.

==Mission to Moscow==
In early 1939, it was announced that Hudson would visit Moscow on a high-profile visit to negotiate a trade treaty. At the same time, the government made an effort to improve the often strained Anglo-Soviet relations. In January 1939, Sir William Seeds was appointed the ambassador to Moscow to replace Lord Chilston, becoming the first British ambassador to the Soviet Union who was actually fluent in Russian, which was taken at the time as a sign of a wish to improve Anglo-Soviet relations. At the same time, it was announced that Hudson would visit Moscow. Lord Halifax, a devout Anglican who normally did little to disguise his discomfort with atheist Soviet Russia, had dinner on 20 February 1939 at the Soviet embassy with Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to the court of St. James&#x27;s. Halifax-who tended to favor a tougher line with Germany than Chamberlain-told the Cabinet that he &quot;did not want to lose any opportunity of establishing closer relations with Russia&quot;. Halifax spoke of &quot;warming up to Russia&quot; and stated that he high hopes that sending the Russian-speaking Hudson to Moscow to negotiate a trade treaty as the best way of effecting that aim. On 1 March 1939, Chamberlain along with four cabinet ministers attended a reception at the Soviet embassy hosted by Maisky to honour the 22nd anniversary of the February revolution of 1917, becong the first time that a prime minister had attended such a reception.
On 8 March 1939, Hudson met with Maisky. Hudson expressed a wish for better Anglo-Soviet relations and assured Maisky that Anglo-Germans relations were deteriorating. Hudson in his account of his meeting wrote that Maisky had told him that he was &quot;quite convinced that we, the British empire, were unable to stand up against German aggression, even with the assistance of France, unless we had the collaboration and help of Russia&quot;. Hudson replied that he did not share that assessment, saying that he believed that Britain and France were capable of defeating Germany on their own and did not need the help of the Soviet Union. Maisky in his account of the meeting stated that Hudson had told him that the Chamberlain had &quot;firmly decided to maintain the empire and its position as a great power&quot;. Maisky had Hudson saying that Britain wanted allies and that: &quot;Here in London, however, many people assured him [Hudson] that the USSR now did not want collaboration with the Western democracies, that it is inclined more and more to a policy of isolation, and that therefore it was pointless to seek a common language with Moscow&quot;. Maisky wrote that Hudson had told him that his upcoming visit to Moscow was meant to clarify &quot;do we [the Soviets] want or do we not want a rapprochement and collaboration with London&quot;. Maisky concluded: &quot;Hence, Hudson&#x27;s visit to Moscow could play a large role...Personally, Hudson would desire very much that this orientation moved on the line London-Paris-Moscow&quot;. Maisky concluded that Hudson was a very ambitious politician who wanted to be prime minister one day, &quot;but I do not think Hudson could take the general line which he developed in today&#x27;s discussion without the sanction of Chamberlain&quot;. Hudson-whom Watt called an &quot;ambitious and driving young Conservative hopeful&quot;-was hoping to achieve some sort of political success during his visit to Moscow that would link better economic relations to closer political ties. Hudson spoke frankly with Sefton Delmer, the foreign correspondent with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper about his ambitions to achieve some sort of an agreement in Moscow that would improve his chances of being promoted into the cabinet proper. In March 1939, Hudson was scheduled to visit Germany to discuss improving Anglo-German trade, but in protest against the German violation of the Munich Agreement by occupying the Czech of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March 1939, the visit was cancelled. Hudson was an appeaser who believed that improving Anglo-German economic relations was the key to saving the peace had very much looking forward to his visit to the &quot;Reich&quot;.

On 23 March 1939, Hudson arrived in Moscow, ostensibly to negotiate an Anglo-Soviet trade treaty, but in fact to seek to improve Anglo-Soviet relations in light of the Danzig crisis. As was usually the case with foreign visitors, Hudson was not allowed to see Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin, and instead negotiated with Maxim Litvinov, the Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Hudson was one of the few ministers in the cabinet who spoke fluent Russian. After meeting him, Litvinov wrote to Stalin: &quot;In view of the rejection of all our previous offers, we have no intention of making any new offers and it is up to others to take the initiative...In particular, we are ready now as we always have been, to co-operate with Britain. We are prepared to look at concrete suggestions&quot;. Hudson told Litvinov that the Munich Agreement had occurred because of British rearmament was still not complete, but that Britain was now far more advanced in its rearmament than it been in September 1938 as Hudson stated: &quot;There will not be a second Munich&quot;. Litvinov stated that his government had been working for a policy of collective security under the banner of the League of Nations since 1934, and hinted that Stalin was losing interest in this policy. However, Litvinov told Hudson that his government &quot;would be prepared to consult with H.M. Government and other governments regarding all suitable measures of resistance whether diplomatic or military or economic. He made it clear that he had in mind the possibility of resistance by force of arms&quot;. Litvinov went on to accuse the French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet of wanting to leave Eastern Europe into the German sphere of influence as the price of keeping France out of another world war as Litvinov expressed much rage at Bonnet to Hudson.

Hudson&#x27;s insistence that he was in Moscow primarily to discuss economic matters and his refusal to discuss Litvinov&#x27;s suggestions of a military alliance doomed his visit to failure. Hudson told Litvinov that he was not convinced that an Anglo-Soviet military alliance was necessary and at one point angered Litvinov when he told him that Britain could do very well without trade with the Soviet Union. Litvinov accused Hudson of being a bully, saying that such threats to cease trade worked with small powers, and that the Soviet Union was a great power. In regard to the trade treaty, Hudson negotiated with Anastas Mikoyan, the Armenian Communist in charge of economic matters under Stalin. As Hudson spoke no Armenian while Mikoyan spoke no English, the two spoke in Russian, their only common language. No agreement was struck as both men sought the best possible economic treaty for their respective nations. Mikoyan mentioned to Hudson that the Soviet Union might be willing to repay the debts owed to British investors that the Soviet regime had rejected in 1918 in return for a &quot;political advantage&quot;. Hudson also talked with Vladimir Potemkin, the deputy foreign commissar, where he spoke in general about a wish for an Anglo-French-Soviet alliance meant to deter Germany from choosing war. Hudson told Potemkin the lie that Britain was capable of sending 19 British Army divisions to France at once to face the Wehrmacht (in fact the British Army could only send 2 divisions to France in March 1939).

Potemkin wrote the Hudson mission was a failure because it &quot;began without serious preparations&quot;. Potemkin compared Hudson to the character of Khlestakov, the protagonist of &quot;The Inspector-General&quot;, an 1836 play by Nikolai Gogol. Potemkin wrote that just as Khlestakov was a vain, lightweight man who persuaded people in a provincial Russian town that he was really the dreaded inspector-general of the Emperor Nicholas I whose task was to root all corruption and inefficiency in the Russian empire, only to be finally exposed at the end as the unimportant man that he really was, that likewise Hudson was just a hack politician who had no real authority to say anything important or even interesting on behalf of London who pretended to be someone important. Much to his disappointment, Hudson was not allowed to see Stalin in the Kremlin as he had hoped, and instead had to settle for posing for a photograph with Litvinov, Mikoyan and the premier Vyacheslav Molotov. A joint communique to the press had prepared which mentioned that Hudson had discussed political and economic matters, but which Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax. vetoed at the last moment for having mentioned political discussions, which he felt would strain relations with Germany. The communique was released anyhow, but the effort of Sir William Seeds, the British ambassador in Moscow, to prevent the communique from being released caused much ill-will in Moscow, where it was seen as a sign that Britain did not want better relations with the Soviet Union.

Upon his return to London, Hudson offered a bleak assessment of the Soviet Union in a memo dated 4 April 1939 to Lord Halifax Hudson wrote that &quot;except where those [Soviet] interests happen to coincide with ours, that they are likely a Government to prove an unreliable ally&quot;. Through not an expert in military matters, Hudson stated that he talked at length with the British military, air and naval attaches at the embassy in Moscow whose unanimous opinion was that the Soviet Union had an abysmally weak military and that &quot;the Russians would be unable to wage an offensive without the regime breaking down&quot;. Hudson criticised the plans for better Anglo-Soviet relations to create a counterweight to Germany as unfeasible, which led him to argue that appeasement of the &quot;Reich&quot; was the only realistic solution to the present problems in Europe.

==The Danzig crisis==
On 17 July 1939, Helmuth Wohlthat, Hermann Göring&#x27;s right-hand man in the Four Year Plan organisation, visited London to attend the meeting of the International Whaling Conference as part of the German delegation. The next day, he and the German ambassador Herbert von Dirksen met Sir Horace Wilson, the Chief Industrial Adviser to the Government and one of the closest friends of Neville Chamberlain to discuss the Danzig crisis. Wohlthat&#x27;s presence in London as part of the International Whaling Conference was merely a cover to meet Wilson, a civil servant widely acknowledged to have the power to discuss confidential matters on behalf of Chamberlain. Misled by the reports of Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador in Berlin, who considered Göring to be his best friend, Chamberlain and the rest of his cabinet had invested much hope that Göring was the principle &quot;moderate&quot; Nazi leader who could restrain Hitler. The Wilson-Wohlthat meetings in London were intended to open a back channel between the Chamberlain government and Göring as Henderson was having some difficulty in seeing the &quot;Reichmarshal&quot; during the crisis. Hudson attended the meetings as an aide to Wilson.

On 20 July 1939, Hudson visited the German embassy to meet Dirksen and Wohlthat, acting on his own. Hudson, an extremely ambitious man who loved intrigue, was hoping to score a great success that would help his otherwise stalled career. Hudson kept detailed notes of his meeting at the German embassy with Wohlthat and Dirksen, where accordingly to him, he proposed a solution to the Danzig crisis. Hudson&#x27;s notes have him saying that in exchange for a German promise not to invade Poland and ending the Anglo-German arms race, there would be a plan for the industrialists running the heavy industry of Germany, Britain and the United States to work together in a consortium for the economic development of China, Eastern Europe and Africa; of a loan in sum of hundreds of millions for Germany to be floated in the City and on Wall Street; and some sort of plan for the &quot;international governance&quot; of Africa, by which he meant that Germany would given a role in the ruling of the African colonies of the European nations. At the time, it was widely accepted that colonies in Africa were necessary to allow the economies of European nations to function, and a major theme of Nazi propaganda was that it was &quot;unjust&quot; that the Treaty of Versailles had deprived the &quot;Reich&quot; of its African colonies. The repeated German demands for the return of the former German African colonies were a major issue in Anglo-German relations as the British government had no intention of returning the former German colonies. Wohlthat&#x27;s account of the meeting had Hudson offering a British loan to the &quot;Reichsbank&quot;, a debt settlement for Germany, and a resolution of the question of the undervalued &quot;Reichmark&quot; versus the British pound sterling, none of which appears in Hudson&#x27;s account of the meeting. Hudson ended his account by saying that if only Hitler would just learn to think in economic terms that much was possible.

After his meeting at the German embassy, Hudson was by all accounts in a state of euphoria, and he asked a group of journalists to come to his house to tell them &quot;off-the-record&quot; about what he had done. A preening Hudson-who believed that he had more or less single-handedly saved the world from the threat of another world war with his visit to the German Embassy-showed his notes of his visit to the embassy to the journalists, telling them it was he who just ended the Danzig crisis with his bold proposals for Anglo-German economic co-operation as Wohlthat was definitely interested in what he had to say. Hudson asked the journalists not to publish this story yet, saying more time was needed for his plan to work as Wohlthat had to return to Germany to report on his offer to Göring, who presumably would convince Hitler to accept it. Two of the journalists present took the view that this was not &quot;off-the-record&quot; and decided to publish the story. Hudson who was described by another Conservative MP as &quot;looks as through he just inherited a fortune and has been celebrating in a hot bath&quot; boasted much about what he just done at a dinner party, speaking very loudly about his &quot;peace-saving&quot; plan.

On 22 July 1939, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; both broke the story on their front-pages that Britain just had offered Germany a loan worth hundreds of millions of pound sterling in exchange for not attacking Poland. The public reaction to this story was highly negative with much of the press calling Hudson&#x27;s proposed loan &quot;Danegeld&quot;. In order to stop the raids of the Vikings, the kings of England had paid the &quot;Danegeld&quot; (&quot;Dane money&quot;) to bribe the Danes not to attack. The term &quot;paying the Danegeld&quot; in England implies weakness and cowardice, that someone would rather bribe an enemy rather than stand up for himself, not the least because the Vikings would sometimes attack England even after the Danegeld had been paid. Hudson&#x27;s offer of a loan to the &quot;Reich&quot; was felt to be rewarding Germany for threatening Poland, hence the &quot;paying the Danegeld&quot; references to his plan. Much to Hudson&#x27;s humiliation, Chamberlain told the House of Commons that no such loan was being considered and that Hudson was speaking for himself. Chamberlain labelled Hudson in a letter to his sister a &quot;conceited&quot; junior minister &quot;with a very bad reputation as a disloyal colleague who is always trying to advance his own interests&quot;. However, in the same letter Chamberlain wrote Hudson had a tendency &quot;to take ideas on which other people have been working on for years and put them forward as his own&quot;. Chamberlain wrote that all of Hudson&#x27;s ideas put forward to Wohlthat except for the loan offer were those that his government had been considering for the last two years. Chamberlain noted that the plan for the &quot;international governance&quot; of the African colonies of the European nations as a compromise solution for the Nazi demand for the restoration of the lost German colonial empire in Africa that Hudson mentioned had already been offered to Hitler by Henderson at a meeting at the Reich Chancellery on 9 March 1938. The British offer had been rejected as Hitler insisted that he wanted all of the former German African colonies to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; at once without preconditions.

The Hudson loan offer proved to be greatly damaging to the image of the Chamberlain government both at home and abroad, especially when it emerged that Wilson had met in secret with Wohlthat, which gave the Hudson-Wohlthat meeting a &quot;demi-semi-official air&quot; as Chamberlain put it. Chamberlain wrote in a letter to his sister about the Hudson affair &quot;all the busybodies in London, Paris, and Burgos have put two &amp; two together and triumphantly made five&quot;. However, Hudson was able to sell exclusive to the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook his account of the loan talks, which were published under the title: &quot;I Planned the Peace Loan to Germany&quot;. Gladwyn Jebb, the private secretary to Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, wrote in a furious memo that Hudson&#x27;s loan offer was &quot;super-appeasement&quot; as he declared that the publication of the plan: &quot;would arose all the suspicions of the Bolsheviks, dishearten the Poles, and encourage the Germans into thinking that we are prepared to buy peace...I must say I doubt whatever such folly could be pushed to a further extreme&quot;.

Hudson&#x27;s meeting with Wohlthat did much damage to the image of the Chamberlain government in Moscow as the Soviet government did not believe that Hudson was acting on his own. At the time, Britain was along with France engaged in talks with the Soviet Union for a &quot;peace front&quot; to deter Germany from invading Poland. The fact that Hudson mentioned that the loan to Germany was to be floated in the City and on Wall Street along with an Anglo-American-German industrial consortium created the impression in Moscow of an Anglo-American capitalist conspiracy to buy off Germany at the expense of the Soviet Union. At the same time, Chamberlain had decided to end the Tientsin incident in China by seeking a compromise solution with Japan instead of executing the Singapore strategy. Through the decision to not execute the Singapore strategy was taken because of the Danzig crisis, Soviet diplomats accused Chamberlain of a &quot;capitulation&quot; to Japan. Jakob Suritz, the Soviet ambassador in Paris, reported to Moscow that while France might be a worthwhile Soviet ally, but not Great Britain as he wrote that the Hudson affair and the Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;capitulation&quot; to end the Tientsin crisis proved that the British were not to be trusted. Maisky was not as extreme as Suritz in his reports to Moscow, but Maisky&#x27;s tendency to put the worse possible gloss on everything Chamberlain did and said gave substance to Suritz&#x27;s charges. Both the Hudson affair and the Tientsin crisis gave the impression in Moscow that the Chamberlain government was not to be trusted, that Chamberlain would rather make a deal with the Axis powers such as Japan and Germany instead of opposing them. Émile Naggiar, the French ambassador in Moscow, in a dispatch to Paris reported that based on his contacts in the Narkomindel that there was &quot;a recrudescence of lack of confidence in Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s intentions&quot; in Moscow. The feeling that the United Kingdom was not to be trusted led Joseph Stalin to place more interest in the alternative diplomatic strategy of seeking an understanding with Germany at the expense of Poland.

Despite the humiliation, Hudson remained convinced that &quot;another Munich&quot; to save the peace was still possible under which the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk) would &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; in exchange for Germany not invading Poland. Hudson kept saying that all he needed was &quot;a little more time&quot; to save the peace. Hudson was unaware of the Y-day for the beginning of &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; (&quot;Case White&quot;), the codename for the invasion of Poland, had been set for 26 August 1939 (later pushed back to 1 September 1939), and that time to save the peace was rapidly running out as Y-day approached. Watt described Hudson as an opportunist who altered between supporting vs. opposing appeasement depending upon what option he felt was best for his career. Watt wrote that Hudson engaged in &quot;criminal pieces of freelancing&quot; in diplomacy that did much damage to Britain&#x27;s reputation during the Danzig crisis.

Watt argued that Hudson along with the other amateur diplomats in the Danzig crisis such as the Australian pilot and MI6 spy, Sidney Cotton; the professional pacifist Corder Catchpool; the German Rhodes scholar and diplomat Adam von Trott zu Solz; the &quot;press lord&quot; Lord Kemsley; Helmut Wohlthat; the civil servant Sir Joseph Ball; and the Kordt brothers, Erich and Theo, all &quot;...combined to create and confuse the efforts made by Chamberlain and Halifax to convince Britain&#x27;s potential allies and enemies alike that Munich would not be repeated; that this time they and their country were resolved. That resolve was an essential element in their strategy to preserve peace&quot;. Watt maintained that the Kordt brothers, Wohlthat, and Trott all gave British officials a highly misleading picture of the political situation in Germany and seriously downplayed Hitler&#x27;s intention to invade Poland while Hudson, Catchpool, Ball, Lord Kemsley, and Cotton in their turn made it seem to the Germans that a deal was possible under which Britain would abandon the &quot;guarantee&quot; to defend Poland. Watt noted the German amateur diplomats gave British decision-makers the misconception that Danzig was the main issue in the crisis and promoted the thesis that Hitler was merely considering invading Poland if Danzig was not returned to Germany while in fact Hitler had firmly decided on war against Poland. Likewise, the British amateur diplomats gave German decision-makers the impression that Britain would not go to war for Poland and that Britain was very open for a deal to leave Poland to its fate. Watt argued that Hudson was one of the more pernicious of the &quot;interlopers in diplomacy&quot; as he gave the impression to Hitler that Britain was prepared to buy peace in the Danzig crisis while also giving the impression to Stalin that Britain was engaged in secret talks with Germany against the Soviet Union during the tense talks for the &quot;peace front&quot; meant to deter Germany from invading Poland.

==Minister==
In April 1940, Hudson was briefly appointed the Minister of Shipping, before on 14 May becoming Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, in the Churchill war ministry, a post he would hold until the 1945 election. In the opinion of Edward Turnour, 6th Earl Winterton, Hudson &quot;was by far the best of Ministers of Agriculture in either war...he was determined to see that farmers and landowners alike utilised every acre of soil to help keep the nation from starvation&quot;. Churchill was dissatisfied with the current agriculture minister, Reginald Dorman-Smith, who was very close to the farmers&#x27; lobby, and replaced him with Hudson, who was an advocate of a &quot;scientific&quot; approach to agriculture. Hudson favoured using the latest scientific methods to improve agricultural productivity with no regard for traditional farming methods, an approach that Dorman-Smith was opposed to. Hudson, besides for his advocacy of a &quot;scientific&quot; approach, also favoured a &quot;nutritional&quot; approach under enough food which would be produced to supply essential nutrition an that Dorman-Smith opposed. Dorman-Smith had once been the president of the National Farmers Union, and in common with many British farmers resented the idea of university-educated experts telling farmers how to best manage their farms. Dorman-Smith disliked the &quot;nutritional&quot; approach, saying &quot;once we fall into the nutrition trap we are sunk&quot;. For an example, Dorman-Smith was opposed to pasteurised milk under the grounds that British people had drunk unpasteurised milk for thousands of years, and he saw no reason for any change. In the winter of 1939–1940, Dorman-Smith had &quot;different conclusions&quot; about agriculture with Winston Churchill, who was serving as the First Lord of Admiralty, and upon becoming prime minister on 10 May 1940, Churchill sacked Dorman-Smith on 14 May. Hudson&#x27;s career had benefitted from his friendship with Robert Boothby who had once served as Churchill&#x27;s parliamentary secretary and who recommended him as Agriculture minister to Churchill.

A major problem for Britain in World War Two was the number of British people vastly exceeded the agricultural capacity of British farms, which thus required Britain to import food to prevent a famine. In 1938, 70% of all the food consumed in Britain came from abroad while only 30% of the food came from British farms. A major aim for Germany in the Second World just as in the First World War was to have the U-boats sink enough shipping to cut off Britain and induce a famine that would force the British to sue for peace. On 28 June 1940, a Scientific Committee appointed by Hudson recommended &quot;a basal diet&quot; as the &quot;foundation of food policy&quot; in view of the possibility of an U-boat-caused famine. The Committee advised that a diet of 2,000 calories per day for every British person would be sufficient to keep the population alive and allow war production to continue. The &quot;basal diet&quot; advised was a mixture of vegetables (especially potatoes), bread, fats (butter and cooking fats), milk and oatmeal. The &quot;basal diet&quot; that was imposed was made possible by extensive rationing.

As Agriculture minister, Hudson strove to make British farming more productive to make up for the food shortages caused by the U-boat campaign. One of Hudson&#x27;s first acts as minister was to appoint 12 leading farmers as his personal deputies with each assigned to a particular region of Britain. In a controversial move, Hudson established in June 1940 a private corporation, Fyfield Estates Limited, of which he and his wife were the leading shareholders, which purchased a number of farms across Britain. By 1945, Fyfield Estates owned 2,000 acres of farmland while Hannah Hudson had purchased a farm in Oxfordshire, where her husband was often seen. Presented as a symbol of Hudson&#x27;s love of agriculture, Fyfield Estates generated controversy as a source of a potential conflict of interest as Hudson was engaged in agriculture while also serving as the minister of agriculture.

In April 1939, Britain had imposed peacetime conscription for the first time ever in British history, and to make up for the farmers conscripted, the Women&#x27;s Land Army had been created in June 1939. Upon becoming Agriculture Minister, Hudson played a major role in expanding the Women&#x27;s Land Army to send thousands of &quot;Land Girls&quot; to the countryside to work the farms. Many of the &quot;Land Girls&quot; as women serving in the Women&#x27;s Land Army were called complained that their efforts were not being taken seriously and that the male civil servants of the Ministry of Agriculture treated them in a very patronising fashion. The stories of the contempt that the &quot;Land Girls&quot; were being shown drove down the number of women willing to join the Women&#x27;s Land Army. Hudson argued that with many British farmers and farmhands serving in the military that the &quot;Land Girls&quot; were essential to provide the necessary workers to expand the productivity of British agriculture and ordered his civil servants to be more respectful of the &quot;Land Girls&quot;.

Besides for the &quot;Land Girls&quot;, Hudson had German and Italian POWs; Jewish refugees; serviceman on furlough who had been farmers before the war; conscientious objectors; and volunteers from the cities all put to work on British farms. Hudson especially favoured the use of Italian POWs as rural labourers because many of the many Italian servicemen taken prisoner came from the rural areas of Italy and were experienced farmers. Owing to the disinclination of many Italians to fight for the Fascist regime and serious morale problems in the Italian military, by 1943 British forces had captured over half million Italians, making the Italians easily the largest group of Axis POWs in British custody, vastly outnumbering the German and Japanese POWs. Starting in 1941, Italians captured in the campaigns in North Africa and East Africa were shipped to the United Kingdom to serve as rural labour and by 1944, there were 150,000 Italian POWs working on British farms. Besides the fact that many of the Italian POWs came from rural areas, it was believed by British officials that the Italian POWs were less likely to cause problems with the British rural communities than the German POWs.

In 1941–1942, Hudson was involved in difficult talks with the United States regarding the American demand for the end of the Imperial Preference tariff system and for Britain to commit to signing a trade agreement that would force Britain to buy a certain amount of American wheat annually at a fixed price. Hudson regarded the American advocacy of multilateralism as the basis of the post-war order as &quot;the height of hypocrisy&quot; as he accused the Roosevelt administration of attempting to use the lend-lease military aid as a leverage to impose an unfavourable economic agreement that would benefit American farmers at the expense of British farmers. During the war, the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt championed what was known at the time as &quot;economic multilateralism&quot; and is today known as &quot;economic globalisation&quot;. As the basis of a post-war economic order, Roosevelt called for the lowering of tariffs, the end of currency exchange regimes, the end of trade quotas and international bodies to arbitrate trade disputes. Roosevelt believed that it was the division into rival economic blocs that were the ultimate cause of both World War One and especially World War Two and that only an &quot;open&quot; economic system uniting the world after the war could prevent another world war. Hudson was one of the leading opponents of &quot;economic multilateralism&quot; in the British cabinet. Hudson maintained that a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; approach and a free trade system would bankrupt most British farmers who would not be able to compete against a flood of cheap American butter, milk, cheese, beef and wheat pouring into the British market. Hudson argued that a system of tariffs would be needed to ensure the survival of British agriculture after the war. Hudson favoured a system of massive subsidies for British farmers and felt that Britain should sign commodity agreements with nations that were weaker than the United Kingdom, which would allow the British to impose economic agreements that would be at their expense. Along with Lord Beaverbrook, the minister of aircraft production and Leo Amery, the India secretary, Hudson was one the principle advocates in the Churchill cabinet who favoured the continuation of the sterling area and the Imperial preference tariffs after the war as being necessary for the economic &quot;survival&quot; of the United Kingdom as a great power.

Beaverbrook, Hudson and Amery were described by the American historian Randall Woods as &quot;the most strident opponents of multilateralism in all of Britain&quot;-were opposed by another pro-multilateralism group within the cabinet that consisted of Lord Cherwell, Sir Richard Law and Sir John Anderson. The protectionist, sterling area approach favoured by Hudson, Beaverbrook and Amery who argued that bilateral trade agreements would be &quot;self-righting&quot; met with much criticism from the economist John Maynard Keynes who serving as a senior civil servant with the Treasury. Keynes wrote: &quot;You exaggerate the extent to which payments agreements are, as such, self-righting or productive of autonomic equilibrium. In the absence of government trading both ways, it is far from the case of being self-righting. For one thing, the initiative to make them lies with the creditor rather than with the debtor country, yet the potential importers and creditor country have no particular motive to discriminate in favour of the goods of the debtor country&quot;. Keynes used as an example the Anglo-Argentine economic agreement of 1933 which increased the exports of Argentine beef and wheat to Britain and led to Argentina being awash in pound sterling, but did not led to Argentines importing more British cotton and textiles as the supporters of the agreement had hoped it would. Keynes admitted that economic multilateralism presented problems for Britain, but he argued that it would be a better economic system after the war than the approach advocated by Beaverbrook, Hudson and Amery.

In April 1942, Hudson purchased Manor Farm in Manningford from George Odlum. Odlum, a leading Canadian agricultural expert had played a key role in developing the tobacco industry in Southern Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) for the British South Africa Company, and then worked in Honduras and Kenya as a plantation manager. Odlum had brought the farm in 1926, where he became renowned for his &quot;scientific&quot; farming as he sought to use the latest methods to improve crop yields and produce cattle whose milk was disease-free. In August 1943, a team of 26 journalists visited Manor Farm and were told that the farm was in a &quot;very poor condition&quot; when Hudson had purchased it the previous year, and the current flourishing state of the farm was all the work of &quot;farmer Hudson&quot;. Odlum at first threatened to sue for libel unless the offending statement about the farm being &quot;in a very poor condition&quot; at the time that Hudson brought it, which appeared in a number of British newspapers, was withdrawn. Odlum had won several awards for his efficiency as a farmer, and felt that the statement that Manor Farm being in a &quot;very poor condition&quot; suggested that the modern farming techniques being employed were all the work of Hudson. When the statement was not withdrawn, Odlum sued Hudson for libel in February 1944.

In 1943, Hudson&#x27;s work together with Lord Woolton and Lord Leathers was lauded by the Canadian journalist Robert Thurlow as a &quot;success story&quot;. Thurlow wrote: &quot;This is the story of three men who supply, and operate, what is probably the world&#x27;s biggest store&quot;. From 1939 to 1943, the amount of arable acreage in Britain increased from 12 million acres to 18 million acres. More importantly, by 1943, 60% of the food consumed in the United Kingdom came from British farms, which lessened the dependence on imported food while freeing up shipping to bring in other supplies.

==The Odlum libel suit==
The libel suit that Odlum launched in 1944 finally came to trial on 21 June 1946. Hudson testified at the trial that Manor Farm was indeed in a &quot;very poor condition&quot; when he purchased it in 1942 as he maintained that the farm yields were sub-par and that Odlum had apologised to him in person for his poor farming skills. Odlum by contrast testified that Hudson had expressed much admiration for the condition of the farm when he inspected it before buying the property. Odlum introduced as evidence the bill of sale that showed that Hudson had paid additional £19,000 for the cattle and farm machinery that went with the farm, which contradicted Hudson&#x27;s account that the farm was derelict and the cattle were understrength. Hudson claimed that he had paid a high price for the farm and only discovered later in 1942 that it was in dismal condition. A key moment occurred when Hudson testified that a potato field on Manor Farm was wasteland when he purchased it, only for Odlum to introduce as evidence a photograph that he had taken of the said field shortly before he sold the farm to Hudson that showed it was already a potato field. The evidence in favour of Odlum was overwhelming and he won the case, being awarded £500 for the damage done to his reputation by Hudson. The Hudson-Odlum libel trial attracted much media attention, and the verdict in favour of Odlum is generally believed to have effectively finished Hudson&#x27;s political career.

Hudson was named Viscount Hudson in 1952.

<text>In theoretical physics, extended supersymmetry is supersymmetry whose infinitesimal generators formula_1 carry not only a spinor index formula_2, but also an additional index formula_3 where formula_4 is integer (such as 2 or 4).

Extended supersymmetry is also called formula_5, formula_6 supersymmetry, for example. Extended supersymmetry is very important for analysis of mathematical properties of quantum field theory and superstring theory. The more extended supersymmetry is, the more it constrains physical observables and parameters.

<text>John Stephen French (born 29 September 1948) is an American drummer and former member of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band, where he was known by the nickname Drumbo. He was the principal drummer on several of Beefheart&#x27;s albums, including 1969&#x27;s &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;, for which he also acted as arranger. He later released several albums as a solo artist as well as with the collaborative group French Frith Kaiser Thompson.

==Early life==
French grew up in Lancaster, California; the same area of Southern California as Frank Zappa, Don Van Vliet and other members of The Magic Band and The Mothers of Invention. He was interested in the local music scene as a teenager, hanging out with Doug Moon and watching The Omens perform live.

==Playing career==
Around 1964, he played and recorded with Merrell and The Exiles, a band led by Merrell Fankhauser and featuring Jeff Cotton on guitar. French and Cotton joined Mark Boston in another band in 1966, never recorded, called Blues in a Bottle. Bill Harkleroad aka Zoot Horn Rollo joined later; thus the nucleus of the &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; band was formed.

===Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band===
French was invited to join Beefheart and the Magic Band in late 1966, as a replacement for Paul Blakely. Having played on &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; (1967), his distinctive drumming style moulded the driving heavy psychedelic blues of &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; (1968) and &quot;Mirror Man&quot; (1967, but not released till 1971). During the &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; sessions, French transcribed the musical ideas Beefheart played for him on piano for the rest of the band. However, shortly after the completion of &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;, French was booted out of the group rather violently by Beefheart (he was thrown down some stairs), and was replaced by the inexperienced Jeff Bruschell. French was also contentiously omitted from the credits of &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; and was largely absent from the band photos taken for the artwork. Nevertheless, he was soon invited back and played on the critically acclaimed albums &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot; and &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot;, sharing percussion duties with Art Tripp aka &quot;Ed Marimba&quot;. Then in late 1972, just before an American tour, he left again.

Beefheart&#x27;s contractual problems in 1975 forced him to join Frank Zappa&#x27;s Bongo Fury tour, but as soon as he was able to, he reformed The Magic Band as their drummer and music director. 1976 saw the recording of the original version of &quot;Bat Chain Puller&quot;, which due to legal ownership problems remained unreleased until 2012. French also played guitar as well as drums on some of these songs. He walked out on Beefheart when his friend John Thomas (keyboards) was sacked from the band.

French visited Beefheart in 1980 looking for work and was hired to take part in the recording of &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot;, playing guitar (and drumming on two tracks). He left before the band toured though, when Beefheart handed him a list of 40 songs to learn over a 3-month period. French sealed the walkout the next day by returning the guitar Beefheart had loaned him.

===Other projects===
French was briefly involved and co-wrote some songs with Mallard, a group formed by other Magic Band members who left in 1974 after tensions within the band (reportedly caused mainly by Beefheart&#x27;s domineering, sometimes abusive, behavior) finally reached a breaking point. Following Mallard, John joined Rattlesnakes and Eggs on drums and vocals for an extended stay.

French has subsequently made solo records, and played with the experimental group French Frith Kaiser Thompson and again with Henry Kaiser in &quot;Crazy Backwards Alphabet&quot;.

In 2000, he was involved in compiling and writing the sleeve notes for the anthology of Beefheart rarities &quot;Grow Fins&quot;. He also gave his insights into the problems of working with Beefheart in the BBC documentary &quot;The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart&quot;.

===The Magic Band reformation===
2003 saw him reform The Magic Band as a live act with Rockette Morton, Denny Walley, and Gary Lucas. They divided the show into an instrumental and a vocal section. French handled the vocals and harmonica, handing over the drum kit to Robert Williams when he was singing. They released an album, &quot;Back to the Front&quot;, in 2004 and a live CD, &quot;21st Century Mirror Men&quot;, in 2005. The Magic Band have continued to tour regularly since then.

===City of Refuge===
In 2008, French released a solo album (under his &quot;Drumbo&quot; moniker) entitled &quot;City of Refuge&quot;. The album features other musicians from The Magic Band including John Thomas, Mark Boston (aka Rockette Morton), Bill Harkleroad (aka Zoot Horn Rollo) and Greg Davidson (aka Ella Guru). The album was released on UK label Proper Records.

===Beefheart: Through the Eyes of Magic===
In 2010 French released this memoir of his time in the Magic Band (Proper Music Publishing, London).

<doc id="1191061" wikidata="Q1202730" url="?curid=1191061" title="EchoLink">
<text>EchoLink is a computer-based amateur radio system distributed free of charge that allows radio amateurs to communicate with other amateur radio operators using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology on the Internet for at least part of the path between them. It was designed by Jonathan Taylor, a radio amateur with call sign K1RFD.
Taylor has been the system engineer and administrator since 2002.

The system allows reliable worldwide connections to be made between radio amateurs, greatly enhancing amateur radio&#x27;s communications capabilities. In essence it is the same as other VoIP applications (such as Skype), but with the unique addition of the ability to link to an amateur radio station&#x27;s transceiver. Thus any low-power handheld amateur radio transceiver which can contact a local EchoLink node (a node is an active EchoLink station with a transceiver attached) can then use the Internet connection of that station to send its transmission via VoIP to any other active EchoLink node, worldwide. No special hardware or software is required to relay a transmission via an EchoLink node.

Before using the system, it is necessary for a prospective user&#x27;s callsign to be validated. The EchoLink system requires that each new user provide positive proof of license and identity before his or her callsign is added to the list of validated users. There is no cost for this service, and it ensures that this system is used only by licensed amateur radio operators.

The software is written to run on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. Another edition of the software runs on Apple mobile devices (iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad), and is available from the Apple App Store. Qtel is an opensource version of the software available in many Linux repositories. An Android version is available on Google Play and several other Android app repositories. In late 2023, EchoLink released a cross-platform Web browser based edition (EchoLink Web), which runs entirely within a Web browser.

== Uses ==
Radio amateurs using the EchoLink software can operate it in one of two modes:
*Single User Mode. If they have an Internet-connected computer, they can use the computer&#x27;s microphone and speakers to connect to (or through - see below) other EchoLink-enabled computers over the Internet and talk to the amateur at the other end.
*Sysop Mode. This entails connecting their own VHF or UHF transceiver to their Internet-connected PC with a simple homemade or manufactured radio-PC digital mode interface. Doing this enables another radio amateur with their own transceiver, who is within radio range of this station, to communicate with (or through) any other EchoLink-equipped station anywhere in the world. This is the unique feature of EchoLink.

Radio amateurs without the EchoLink software or a computer connected to the Internet can take advantage of the EchoLink network if they are within radio range of a sysop mode EchoLink station. It is also possible to link a sysop mode EchoLink station to a local repeater, further enhancing the communication possibilities.

== Smartphone editions ==
Editions of EchoLink are also available for two of the major smartphone platforms. In February 2010, an edition of EchoLink was released for the Apple iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch on the App Store. In August 2010, an edition of EchoLink was released for the Android platform, and is now available in the Google Play Store. Both the iOS and Android editions were created by Jonathan Taylor (K1RFD), the author of the original Windows edition.

== EchoLink-compatible software for other operating systems ==
Open source software packages that are largely compatible with EchoLink are available for Macintosh (EchoMac and EchoHam) and Linux (echoLinux or SvxLink/Qtel).

SvxLink Server is an alternative implementation for Linux. It only implements sysop mode.

EchoIRLP is a software add on for IRLP which enables an IRLP node to operate as a sysop mode EchoLink station.

Amateurs running the app_rpt extension for Asterisk can also enable EchoLink functionality by loading an EchoLink channel driver. This option is included in packages such as hamvoip that run on the AllStarLink network.

The EchoLink software, which is designed to run on Microsoft Windows, has also been known to work on several Linux builds as well if loaded through Wine.

<doc id="1191062" wikidata="Q5281094" url="?curid=1191062" title="Dirty Story (play)">
<text>Dirty Story is a 2003 play by John Patrick Shanley. It allegorically presents the political relationship between Israel and Palestine as a sexual, sadomasochistic relationship between a man and a woman. This turbulent relationship is refereed by a gun toting, cigarette selling American cowboy and his snide British side-kick.

It premiered in 2003, and was revived in 2012. It was published in 2008.

==Reception==

A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;appallingly entertaining&quot;. Another review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The play&#x27;s strength lies in Mr. Shanley&#x27;s keen ear for each side&#x27;s stereotypes, both of itself and of the other.&quot;

A review on &quot;TheaterMania&quot; wrote that &quot;By play&#x27;s end, the dialogue has devolved into baldly polemical statements; each actor is nothing more than a mouthpiece for a political position, and there is no sense of character remaining. This may have been the playwright&#x27;s intention, but it&#x27;s a losing strategy.&quot;

A negative review on Crosscut.com wrote &quot;In the end, though, it’s hard to know what the point of Dirty Story is.&quot;

<text>Einstein@Home is a volunteer computing project that searches for signals from spinning neutron stars in data from gravitational-wave detectors, from large radio telescopes, and from a gamma-ray telescope. Neutron stars are detected by their pulsed radio and gamma-ray emission as radio and/or gamma-ray pulsars. They also might be observable as continuous gravitational wave sources if they are rapidly spinning and non-axisymmetrically deformed. The project was officially launched on 19 February 2005 as part of the American Physical Society&#x27;s contribution to the World Year of Physics 2005 event.

Einstein@Home searches data from the LIGO gravitational-wave detectors. The project conducts the most sensitive all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves. While no such signal has yet been detected, the upper limits set by Einstein@Home analyses provide astrophysical constraints on the Galactic population of spinning neutron stars.

Einstein@Home also searches radio telescope data from the Arecibo Observatory, and has in the past analyzed data from Parkes Observatory. On 12 August 2010, the first discovery by Einstein@Home of a previously undetected radio pulsar J2007+2722, found in data from the Arecibo Observatory, was published in &quot;Science&quot;. This was the first data-based discovery by a volunteer computing project. As of December 2023 Einstein@Home had discovered 55 radio pulsars.

The project also analyses data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to discover gamma-ray pulsars. On 26 November 2013, the first Einstein@Home results of the Fermi data analysis was published: the discovery of four young gamma-ray pulsars in LAT data. As of December 2023, Einstein@Home has discovered 39 previously unknown gamma-ray pulsars in data from the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The Einstein@Home search makes use of novel and more efficient data-analysis methods and discovered pulsars missed in other analyses of the same data.

The project runs on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software platform and uses free software released under the GNU General Public License, version 2. Einstein@Home is hosted by the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute, Hannover, Germany) and the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The project is supported by the Max Planck Society (MPG), the American Physical Society (APS), and the US National Science Foundation (NSF). The Einstein@Home project director is Bruce Allen.

Einstein@Home uses the power of volunteer computing in solving the computationally intensive problem of analyzing a large volume of data. Such an approach was pioneered by the SETI@home project, which is designed to look for signs of extraterrestrial life by analyzing radio wave data. Einstein@Home runs through the same software platform as SETI@home, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). As of December 2023, more than 492,000 volunteers in 226 countries had participated in the project, making it the third-most-popular active BOINC application. Users regularly contribute about 7.7 petaFLOPS of computational power, which would rank Einstein@Home among the top 105 on the TOP500 list of supercomputers.

== Scientific objectives ==
The Einstein@Home project was originally created to perform all-sky searches for previously unknown continuous gravitational-wave (CW) sources using data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detector instruments in Washington and Louisiana, USA. The best understood potential CW sources are rapidly spinning neutron stars (including pulsars) which are expected to emit gravitational waves due to a deviation from Rotational symmetry. Besides validating Einstein&#x27;s theory of General Relativity, direct detection of gravitational waves would also constitute an important new astronomical tool. As most neutron stars are electromagnetically invisible, gravitational-wave observations might also reveal completely new populations of neutron stars. A CW detection could potentially be extremely helpful in neutron-star astrophysics and would eventually provide unique insights into the nature of matter at high densities, because it provides a way of examining the bulk motion of the matter.

Since March 2009, part of the Einstein@Home computing power has also been used to analyze data taken by the PALFA Consortium at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. This search effort is designed to find radio pulsars in tight binary systems. It is expected that there is one radio pulsar detectable from Earth in an orbital system with a period of less than one hour. A similar search has also been performed on two archival data sets from the Parkes Multi-beam Pulsar Survey. The Einstein@Home radio pulsar search employs mathematical methods developed for the search for gravitational waves.

Since July 2011, Einstein@Home is also analyzing data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), the primary instrument on Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to search for pulsed gamma-ray emission from spinning neutron stars (gamma-ray pulsars). Some neutron stars are only detectable by their pulsed gamma-ray emission, which originates in a different area of the neutron star magnetosphere than the radio emission. Identifying the neutron star&#x27;s rotation rate is computationally difficult, because for a typical gamma-ray pulsar only thousands of gamma-ray photons will be detected by the LAT over the course of billions of rotations. The Einstein@Home analysis of the LAT data makes use of methods initially developed for the detection of continuous gravitational waves.

== Gravitational-wave data analysis and results ==

Einstein@Home has carried out many analysis runs using data from the LIGO instruments. Since its first search run in 2005, the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors has been improved in a series of steps and upgrades. This is continuing with the current Advanced LIGO detectors. At the same time, Einstein@Home search algorithms have also improved. Together these have increased the search sensitivity by several orders of magnitude.

Einstein@Home&#x27;s first analysis used data from the &quot;third science run&quot; (S3) of LIGO. Processing of the S3 data set was conducted between 22 February 2005 and 2 August 2005. This analysis employed 60 segments from the LIGO Hanford 4-km detector, totaling ten hours of data each. Each 10-hour segment was analyzed for CW signals by the volunteers&#x27; computers using a matched-filtering technique. When all matched-filtering results were returned, the results from different segments were then combined in a &quot;post-processing step&quot; on Einstein@Home servers via a coincidence scheme to further enhance search sensitivity. Results were published on the Einstein@Home webpages.

Work on the S4 data set (LIGO&#x27;s fourth science run) was started via interlacing with the S3 calculations and finished in July 2006. This analysis used 10 segments of 30 hours each from the LIGO Hanford 4-km detector and 7 segments of 30 hours each from the LIGO Livingston 4-km detector. Besides the S4 data being more sensitive, a more sensitive coincidence combination scheme was also applied in the post-processing. The results of this search have led to the first scientific publication of Einstein@Home in &quot;Physical Review D&quot;.

Einstein@Home gained considerable attention in the international volunteer computing community when an optimized application for the S4 data set analysis was developed and released in March 2006 by project volunteer Akos Fekete, a Hungarian programmer. Fekete improved the official S4 application and introduced SSE, 3DNow! and SSE3 optimizations into the code improving performance by up to 800%. Fekete was recognized for his efforts and was afterward officially involved with the Einstein@Home team in the development of the new S5 application. As of late July 2006, this new official application had become widely distributed among Einstein@Home users. The app created a large surge in the project&#x27;s total performance and productivity, as measured by floating point speed (or FLOPS), which over time has increased by approximately 50% compared to non-optimized S4 applications.

The first Einstein@Home analysis of the early LIGO S5 data set, where the instruments initially reached their design sensitivity, began on 15 June 2006. This search used 22 segments of 30 hours each from the LIGO Hanford 4-km detector and six segments of 30 hours from the LIGO Livingston 4-km detector. This analysis run (code name &quot;S5R1&quot;), employing the search methodology as Einstein@Home, was very similar to the previous S4 analysis. However, the search results were more sensitive due to the use of more data of better quality compared to S4. Over large parts of the search parameter space, these results, which also appeared in Physical Review D, are the most exhaustive published to date.

The second Einstein@Home search of LIGO S5 data (code name &quot;S5R3&quot;) constituted a further major improvement regarding search sensitivity. As opposed to previous searches, the ensuing results were already combined &quot;on the volunteers&#x27; computers&quot; via a Hough transform technique. This method matched-filtered results from 84 data segments of 25 hours each, parameters from which came from both 4-km LIGO Hanford and Livingston instruments.

On 7 May 2010, a new Einstein@Home search (code name &quot;S5GC1&quot;), which uses a significantly improved search method, launched. This program analyzed 205 data segments of 25 hours each, using data from both 4-km LIGO Hanford and Livingston instruments. It employed a technique which exploited global parameter-space correlations to efficiently combine the matched-filtering results from the different segments.

Results from an Einstein@Home all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO S5 data were published on 13 February 2013. In the most sensitive frequency band of the search (a half-Hertz band at 152.5 Hertz), the presence of periodic gravitational waves with strain amplitude larger than 7.6×10−25 could be excluded at 90% confidence. Overall, the search was 3 times as sensitive as previous Einstein@Home searches in LIGO S5 data. Details of the two-stage follow-up procedure for signal candidates used in this study were published on 25 June 2014.

A search for high-frequency (1249 Hertz to 1499 Hertz) continuous gravitational waves in LIGO S5 data by Einstein@Home, published on 26 September 2016, was the only such search in LIGO data. No signal candidates were identified. The search excluded neutron stars with spin frequencies between 625 Hertz and 770 Hertz and with ellipticities greater than 2.8×10−7 closer than 100 parsec to Earth.

Data from LIGO 6th science run (S6) were analyzed by Einstein@Home and the results were published on 18 November 2016. No signal was found and the search set the most stringent upper limits for an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves at the time of publication. In the most sensitive frequency band between 170.5 Hertz and 171 Hertz there were (with 90% confidence) no continuous gravitational waves with a strain amplitude of more than 5.5×10−25 detected. At frequencies of 230 Hertz, the search results exclude neutron stars with ellipticities greater than 10−6 within 100 parsecs of Earth.

Einstein@Home conducted a directed search for continuous gravitational waves from the central object in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. It used data from the LIGO S6 run and searched over a range of frequencies from 50 Hertz to 1000 Hertz, because the spin frequency of the central object is unknown. No signal was found. The upper limits on gravitational-wave emission from Cassiopeia A were the most stringent at the time of publication, about a factor two lower than previous upper limits.

On 28 December 2016 results from a follow-up of the all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO S6 data were published. Out of a total of 3.8 × 1010 signal candidates from the earlier search, the 16 million most promising were analyzed using a four-stage hierarchical process. No candidate was found to be consistent with an astrophysical source of continuous gravitational waves. In the frequency band between 170.5 Hertz and 171 Hertz the upper limit (90% confidence) on the strain amplitude was 4.3×10−25, a factor 1.3 lower than in the previous search.

Searches for continuous gravitational waves are limited by the available computing power. Within the project, research on improving the sensitivity of the searches with new methods is conducted. In late 2017 two publications were published, describing improved methods of candidate clustering in the hierarchical searches and new &quot;veto&quot; methods that distinguish between astrophysical continuous gravitational waves and detector artifacts mimicking them.

Both these new methods were employed in the first Einstein@Home all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in Advanced LIGO data from the first observing run (O1), the results of which were published on 8 December 2017. The first part of the search investigated the lower end of the LIGO frequency band between 20 Hertz and 100 Hertz. No signals were found. The most stringent upper limit (90% confidence) on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude set by the search was 1.8×10−25 at a frequency of 100 Hertz.

An Einstein@Home study on how to optimally use the limited computing power for directed searches (where prior information on the target object such as the sky position is available) was published on 31 January 2018. It describes the design of searches for continuous gravitational waves over a wide frequency range from three supernova remnants (Vela Jr, Cassiopeia A, and G347.3).

The results from the directed Einstein@Home search for continuous gravitational waves from the central objects of the supernova remnants Vela Jr., Cassiopeia A, and G347.3 was published on 29 July 2019. It covered a frequency range from 20 Hertz to 1500 Hertz and used data from LIGO&#x27;s first observing run O1. No signal was found and the most stringent upper limit at the time of publication were set, improving earlier results by a factor of two for all three targets.

A follow-up of the Einstein@Home search for continuous gravitational waves from the central objects of the supernova remnants Vela Jr., Cassiopeia A, and G347.3 was published on 29 June 2020. It investigated the most promising 10,000 candidates from the previous search and followed them up in two stretches of data from LIGO&#x27;s second observing run (O2). A single candidate associated with G347.3 remained as a possible signal after the follow-up, but was not conclusively confirmed based on gravitational-wave data. Archival X-ray data were searched for pulsations at the putative rotation frequency of the neutron star and its integer multiples. No signal was found. It is expected that data from LIGO&#x27;s third observing run (O3) will suffice to shed light on the nature of this potential candidate.

On 8 March 2021 results from an Einstein@Home all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO O2 data were published. It used an eight-stage follow-up process and covered a frequency range from 20 Hertz to 585 Hertz and reached the highest sensitivity for any all-sky survey below 500 Hertz. Six candidates were found after all follow-up stages. They are consistent with and caused by validation hardware injections in the LIGO instruments. No other signal was found. The most stringent upper limit (90% confidence) was set in a 0.5 Hertz band at 163 Hertz at a gravitational-wave strain amplitude of 1.3×10−25. The results begin to probe neutron star astrophysics and population properties. They exclude neutron stars with rotation frequencies above 200 Hertz with ellipticities larger than 10−7 (which are predicted by some models of neutron star crusts) closer than 100 parsec.

Results from a dedicated Einstein@Home search for continuous gravitational waves from the central object of the supernova remnant G347.3 was published on 5 August 2021. In the analysed frequency range between 20 Hertz and 400 Hertz no signal was found. The derived upper limits correspond to ellipticities of less than 10−6 for most of the frequency band. In the most sensitive frequency band at 166 Hertz the upper limit (90% confidence) on gravitational-wave strain is 7.0×10−26.

In July 2023, the results of an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in the public LIGO O3 data were published. The search was the most sensitive at that time for gravitational waves with frequencies between 2o Hertz and 800 Hertz and with spin-downs of up to −2.6×10−9 Hz s−1. No astrophysical gravitational-wave signal was identified, and all candidate signals could be attributed to artificial signals injected into the LIGO data for validation purposes. The results exclude the existence of isolated neutron stars spinning at rotational frequencies of more than 200 Hertz with ellipticities larger than 5×10−8 closer than 100 parsec.

== Radio data analysis and results ==
On 24 March 2009, it was announced that the Einstein@Home project was beginning to analyze data received by the PALFA Consortium at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.

On 26 November 2009, a CUDA-optimized application for the Arecibo Binary Pulsar Search was first detailed on official Einstein@Home webpages. This application uses both a regular CPU and an NVIDIA GPU to perform analyses faster (in some cases up to 50% faster).

On 12 August 2010, the Einstein@Home project announced the discovery of a new disrupted binary pulsar, PSR J2007+2722; it may be the fastest-spinning such pulsar discovered to date. The computers of Einstein@Home volunteers Chris and Helen Colvin and Daniel Gebhardt observed PSR 2007+2722 with the highest statistical significance.

On 1 March 2011, the Einstein@Home project announced their second discovery: a binary pulsar system PSR J1952+2630. The computers of Einstein@Home volunteers from Russia and the UK observed PSR J1952+2630 with the highest statistical significance.

By 15 May 2012 a new application for ATI/AMD graphic cards had been released. Using OpenCL, the new application was ten times faster than running on a typical CPU.

On 22 July 2013, an Android application version of the radio pulsar search was announced. Like the CPU application, the Android application processes data from Arecibo Observatory.

On 20 August 2013, the discovery of 24 pulsars in data from the Parks Multi-beam Pulsar Survey was published. The re-analysis of the data found these pulsars, which were missed by previous analyses and re-analyses of the data. Six of the discovered pulsars are in binary systems.

The discovery of a double neutron star binary in PALFA data by the project was published on 4 November 2016. PSR J1913+1102 is in a 4.95 hour orbit with a neutron star partner. By measuring the relativistic periastron advance, the total mass of the system was determined to 2.88 solar masses, similar to the mass of the most massive double neutron star, B1913+16.

Timing analysis of 13 radio pulsars discovered by Einstein@Home were published by the PALFA Consortium in August 2021.

On 31 October 2023 the project announced the launch of a new Zooniverse project called &quot;Pulsar Seekers&quot;. In this project, citizen scientists visually inspect and classify sets of diagnostic plots for pulsar candidates produced from the Einstein@Home analysis of observations from the large Arecibo telescope&#x27;s PALFA pulsar survey. The goal is to identify new pulsars in these data.

As of December 2023, the Einstein@Home project had discovered a total of 55 radio pulsars: 24 using Parkes Multibeam Survey data and 31 using Arecibo radio data (including two from the Arecibo Binary Radio Pulsar Search and 29 using data from the PALFA Mock spectrometer data from Arecibo Observatory).

== Gamma-ray data analysis and results ==
On 1 July 2011 the project announced a new application to search for pulsars in data from the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

On 26 November 2013, the discovery of four young gamma-ray pulsars in LAT data by the Einstein@Home project was published. All four pulsars are located in the plane of our Galaxy and have spin frequencies of less than 10 Hertz and characteristic ages between 35,000 and 56,000 years. No radio waves were detected from any of the pulsars.

The discovery of the gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1906+0722 was published on 4 August 2015. The discovery confirmed the pulsar nature of the object which had been suspected since 2012 based on the energy distribution of the gamma-ray photons observed by the LAT. The pulsar is young and energetic. In August 2009 it suffered one of the largest glitches observed from a gamma-ray pulsar. No radio pulsations were detected in any follow-up search, making PSR J1906+0722 likely radio-quiet. Advanced methods of timing the arrival times of gamma-ray pulsations were introduced to improve the parameter inference of astrophysical properties.

On 16 November 2016 the discovery and timing measurements of PSR J1208−6238, the youngest known radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar, were published. Even though the inferred age is 2,700 years, no associated supernova remnant or pulsar wind nebula could be identified.

On 11 January 2017, the first results from a survey of 118 unidentified pulsar-like sources from the Fermi-LAT Catalog were published. A total of 13 new pulsars were found. Most of them are young and were formed in supernovae several tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago. The discoveries and the methods used in the survey were published in the first of two associated papers. The second paper reports faint radio pulsations from two of the 13 gamma-ray pulsars, and presents modeling of the gamma-ray and radio pulse profiles with different geometric emission models.

The discovery of two millisecond pulsars discovered by Einstein@Home through their pulsed gamma radiation was published on 28 February 2018. PSR J1035−6720, spinning at 348 Hertz, has detectable radio pulsations which were found in follow-up searches. The other discovery PSR J1744−7619 is the first radio-quiet millisecond pulsar ever discovered. The project also announced that it was searching for gamma-ray pulsars in binary systems, which are more difficult to find due to the additional orbital parameters.

The first Einstein@Home discovery of a gamma-ray pulsar in a binary system was published on 22 October 2020. PSR J1653-0158, a neutron star with about two solar masses and one of the highest known rotation frequencies of 508 Hertz, orbits the common center of mass with a companion of only 1% of the Sun&#x27;s mass. The orbital period is 75 minutes, shorter than that of any comparable binary systems. The discovery was made using a GPU-accelerated version of a modified gamma-ray pulsar search code, which included binary orbital parameters. No radio waves were found in follow-up searches. A search for gravitational waves from the pulsar discovered no such emission. The pulsar is from a class known as black widow pulsars. The pulsar evaporates its companion with its energetic radiation and a particle wind. The ablated material fills the binary system with a cloud of plasma absorbing radio waves, but not gamma radiation.

A second discovery of a gamma-ray pulsar in an unusual binary system was reported on 2 February 2021. It was thought to be a &quot;redback&quot; millisecond pulsar system, but no pulsations from the neutron star had been observed. Optical observations of the pulsar companion were used to constrain the orbital parameters of the system. A thus targeted search for gamma-ray pulsations with Einstein@Home found a low-mass pulsar spinning at 377 Hertz in a 5.5 hour orbit with a companion of about a fifth of a solar mass. Precision timing of the gamma-ray pulsations revealed unpredictable changes in the orbital period of up to ten milliseconds. They might be linked to changes in the mass distribution of the companion caused by its magnetic activity, which in turn would affect the pulsar orbit through the changing external gravitational field.

The discovery of 14 previously unknown gamma-ray pulsars in Fermi-LAT data was announced by the project on 15 June 2021.

In November 2023 the Third Fermi Large Area Telescope Catalog of Gamma-Ray Pulsars was published. The catalog lists 39 pulsars discovered with Einstein@Home and 14 with Einstein@Home methods implemented on a large compute cluster. The catalog also includes 13 candidate spider pulsar systems, that could be targets for future searches for their gamma-ray pulsations with Einstein@Home.

As of December 2023, the Einstein@Home project had discovered a total of 39 gamma-ray pulsars in Fermi LAT data.

<doc id="1191067" wikidata="Q2299100" url="?curid=1191067" title="Magnetic vector potential">
<text>In classical electromagnetism, magnetic vector potential (often called A) is the vector quantity defined so that its curl is equal to the magnetic field: formula_1. Together with the electric potential &quot;φ&quot;, the magnetic vector potential can be used to specify the electric field E as well. Therefore, many equations of electromagnetism can be written either in terms of the fields E and B, or equivalently in terms of the potentials &quot;φ&quot; and A. In more advanced theories such as quantum mechanics, most equations use potentials rather than fields.

Magnetic vector potential was independently introduced by Franz Ernst Neumann and Wilhelm Eduard Weber in 1845 and in 1846, respectively to discuss Ampère&#x27;s circuital law. William Thomson also introduced the modern version of the vector potential in 1847, along with the formula relating it to the magnetic field.

== Unit conventions ==
This article uses the SI system.

In the SI system, the units of A are V·s·m−1 and are the same as that of momentum per unit charge, or force per unit current.

== Magnetic vector potential ==
The magnetic vector potential, formula_2, is a vector field, and the electric potential, formula_3, is a scalar field such that:
formula_4
where formula_5 is the magnetic field and formula_6 is the electric field. In magnetostatics where there is no time-varying current or charge distribution, only the first equation is needed. (In the context of electrodynamics, the terms &quot;vector potential&quot; and &quot;scalar potential&quot; are used for &quot;magnetic vector potential&quot; and &quot;electric potential&quot;, respectively. In mathematics, vector potential and scalar potential can be generalized to higher dimensions.)

If electric and magnetic fields are defined as above from potentials, they automatically satisfy two of Maxwell&#x27;s equations: Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism and Faraday&#x27;s law. For example, if formula_2 is continuous and well-defined everywhere, then it is guaranteed not to result in magnetic monopoles. (In the mathematical theory of magnetic monopoles, formula_2 is allowed to be either undefined or multiple-valued in some places; see magnetic monopole for details).

Starting with the above definitions and remembering that the divergence of the curl is zero and the curl of the gradient is the zero vector:
formula_9

Alternatively, the existence of formula_2 and formula_3 is guaranteed from these two laws using Helmholtz&#x27;s theorem. For example, since the magnetic field is divergence-free (Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism; i.e., formula_12), formula_13 always exists that satisfies the above definition.

The vector potential formula_14 is used when studying the Lagrangian in classical mechanics and in quantum mechanics (see Schrödinger equation for charged particles, Dirac equation, Aharonov–Bohm effect).

In minimal coupling, formula_15 is called the potential momentum, and is part of the canonical momentum.

The line integral of formula_2 over a closed loop, formula_17, is equal to the magnetic flux, formula_18, through a surface, formula_19, that it encloses:
formula_20

Therefore, the units of formula_2 are also equivalent to weber per metre. The above equation is useful in the flux quantization of superconducting loops.

Although the magnetic field, formula_5, is a pseudovector (also called axial vector), the vector potential, formula_2, is a polar vector. This means that if the right-hand rule for cross products were replaced with a left-hand rule, but without changing any other equations or definitions, then formula_5 would switch signs, but A would not change. This is an example of a general theorem: The curl of a polar vector is a pseudovector, and vice versa.

=== Gauge choices ===
The above definition does not define the magnetic vector potential uniquely because, by definition, we can arbitrarily add curl-free components to the magnetic potential without changing the observed magnetic field. Thus, there is a degree of freedom available when choosing formula_2. This condition is known as gauge invariance.

Two common gauge choices are
* The Lorenz gauge: formula_26
* The Coulomb gauge: formula_27

=== Lorenz gauge ===

In other gauges, the formulas for formula_2 and formula_3 are different; for example, see &quot;Coulomb gauge&quot; for another possibility.

==== Time domain ====
Using the above definition of the potentials and applying it to the other two Maxwell&#x27;s equations (the ones that are not automatically satisfied) results in a complicated differential equation that can be simplified using the Lorenz gauge where formula_14 is chosen to satisfy:
formula_26

Using the Lorenz gauge, the electromagnetic wave equations can be written compactly in terms of the potentials, 
* Wave equation of the scalar potential formula_32
* Wave equation of the vector potential formula_33

The solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the Lorenz gauge (see Feynman and Jackson) with the boundary condition that both potentials go to zero sufficiently fast as they approach infinity are called the retarded potentials, which are the magnetic vector potential formula_34 and the electric scalar potential formula_35 due to a current distribution of current density formula_36, charge density formula_37, and volume formula_38, within which formula_39 and formula_40 are non-zero at least sometimes and some places):
* Solutions formula_41
where the fields at position vector formula_42 and time formula_43 are calculated from sources at distant position formula_44 at an earlier time formula_45 The location formula_46 is a source point in the charge or current distribution (also the integration variable, within volume formula_47). The earlier time formula_48 is called the &quot;retarded time&quot;, and calculated as
formula_49
formula_50

===== Time-domain notes=====

* The Lorenz gauge condition is satisfied:
: formula_51
* The position of formula_42, the point at which values for formula_3 and formula_2 are found, only enters the equation as part of the scalar distance from formula_46 to formula_56 The direction from formula_46 to formula_58 does not enter into the equation. The only thing that matters about a source point is how far away it is.
* The integrand uses &quot;retarded time&quot;, formula_45 This reflects the fact that changes in the sources propagate at the speed of light. Hence the charge and current densities affecting the electric and magnetic potential at formula_42 and formula_43, from remote location formula_62 must also be at some prior time formula_63
* The equation for formula_2 is a vector equation. In Cartesian coordinates, the equation separates into three scalar equations: formula_65 In this form it is apparent that the component of formula_2 in a given direction depends only on the components of formula_67 that are in the same direction. If the current is carried in a straight wire, formula_2 points in the same direction as the wire.

==== Frequency domain ====

The preceding time domain equations can be expressed in the frequency domain.
* Lorenz gauge formula_69 or formula_70
* Solutions formula_71
* Wave equations formula_72
* Electromagnetic field equations formula_73
where
: formula_74 and formula_75 are scalar phasors.
: formula_76 and formula_77 are vector phasors.
: formula_78

===== Frequency domain notes =====

There are a few notable things about formula_2 and formula_3 calculated in this way:
* The Lorenz gauge condition is satisfied: formula_81 This implies that the frequency domain electric potential, formula_3, can be computed entirely from the current density distribution, formula_40.
* The position of formula_84 the point at which values for formula_3 and formula_2 are found, only enters the equation as part of the scalar distance from formula_46 to formula_88 The direction from formula_46 to formula_42 does not enter into the equation. The only thing that matters about a source point is how far away it is.
* The integrand uses the phase shift term formula_91 which plays a role equivalent to &quot;retarded time&quot;. This reflects the fact that changes in the sources propagate at the speed of light; propagation delay in the time domain is equivalent to a phase shift in the frequency domain. 
* The equation for formula_2 is a vector equation. In Cartesian coordinates, the equation separates into three scalar equations: formula_93 In this form it is apparent that the component of formula_2 in a given direction depends only on the components of formula_95 that are in the same direction. If the current is carried in a straight wire, formula_2 points in the same direction as the wire.

=== Depiction of the A-field ===
See Feynman for the depiction of the formula_2 field around a long thin solenoid.

Since 
formula_98
assuming quasi-static conditions, i.e. 
: formula_99 and formula_100,
the lines and contours of formula_101 relate to formula_102 like the lines and contours of formula_5 relate to formula_104 Thus, a depiction of the formula_2 field around a loop of formula_5 flux (as would be produced in a toroidal inductor) is qualitatively the same as the formula_5 field around a loop of current.

The figure to the right is an artist&#x27;s depiction of the formula_108 field. The thicker lines indicate paths of higher average intensity (shorter paths have higher intensity so that the path integral is the same). The lines are drawn to (aesthetically) impart the general look of the 

The drawing tacitly assumes formula_109, true under any one of the following assumptions:
* the Coulomb gauge is assumed
* the Lorenz gauge is assumed and there is no distribution of charge, formula_110 
* the Lorenz gauge is assumed and zero frequency is assumed
* the Lorenz gauge is assumed and a non-zero frequency, but still assumed sufficiently low to neglect the term formula_111
=== Electromagnetic four-potential ===
In the context of special relativity, it is natural to join the magnetic vector potential together with the (scalar) electric potential into the electromagnetic potential, also called &quot;four-potential&quot;.

One motivation for doing so is that the four-potential is a mathematical four-vector. Thus, using standard four-vector transformation rules, if the electric and magnetic potentials are known in one inertial reference frame, they can be simply calculated in any other inertial reference frame.

Another, related motivation is that the content of classical electromagnetism can be written in a concise and convenient form using the electromagnetic four potential, especially when the Lorenz gauge is used. In particular, in abstract index notation, the set of Maxwell&#x27;s equations (in the Lorenz gauge) may be written (in Gaussian units) as follows:
formula_112
where formula_113 is the d&#x27;Alembertian and formula_114 is the four-current. The first equation is the Lorenz gauge condition while the second contains Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The four-potential also plays a very important role in quantum electrodynamics.

=== Charged particle in a field ===
In a field with electric potential formula_115 and magnetic potential formula_116, the Lagrangian (formula_117) and the Hamiltonian (formula_118) of a particle with mass formula_119 and charge formula_120 areformula_121

<text>George Henry Wyatt (usually known as George Harry Wyatt) VC (5 September 1886 – 22 January 1964) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
George Henry Wyatt was born on 5 September 1886 at Worcester, and enlisted into the Coldstream Guards, British Army on 23 November 1904 at Birmingham. He served with the 2nd Battalion of his regiment at home, and then with the 3rd Battalion, then serving in Egypt.

Transferring to the Reserves on 9 January 1909, he joined the Barnsley Borough Police. Wyatt was recalled to the Army at the outbreak of the First World War on 5 August 1914.

<text>Ingatestone is a village and former civil parish in Essex, England, with a population of 5,409 inhabitants at the 2021 Census. Just north lies the village of Fryerning; the two now forming the parish of Ingatestone and Fryerning, in the Borough of Brentwood. Ingatestone lies in the Metropolitan Green Belt 20 miles (32 km) north-east of London. Its built-up area straddles the A12 trunk road and the Great Eastern Main Line railway.

==History==

Ingatestone appeared in Saxon times on the Essex Great Road (now the A12) between the Roman towns of Londinium (London) and Camulodunum (Colchester). The name means &quot;Ing at the Stone&quot;, the suffix distinguishing it from nearby settlements that also formed part of the manor of Ing. It is first recorded in 1283 as &quot;Gynges atte Ston&quot;. It appears as &quot;Inge atte Stone&quot; in 1433. 

The village is built on boulder clay lands. The village stone, deposited by glacial action, is unusual for the area. A large Sarsen stone can still be seen, split into three, with one piece by the west door of the St Edmund and St Mary&#x27;s parish church and one each side of the entrance to Fryerning Lane.

Ingatestone belonged to Barking Abbey from about 950 CE until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when it was purchased from the Crown by Sir William Petre. Petre, originally a lawyer from Devon, had risen to become the Secretary of State to Henry VIII. He built a large courtyard house, Ingatestone Hall, as his home in the village, along with almshouses which still exist today as private cottages in Stock Lane.

By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Fryerning and Ingatestone (&quot;Inga&quot;) were assigned to the Hundred of Chelmsford, as part of the land of St Mary of Barking with a value of 60 shillings (£3), held by Robert Gernon in demesne.

By the 18th century, Ingatestone had become a coaching centre; however, the advent of the railway saw its importance decrease, along with the traffic on the Essex Great Road. By 1881, the parish had a population of 926, and on 24 March 1889 the parishes of Ingatestone and Fryerning merged to form Ingatestone and Fryerning, encompassing an area of almost . Ingatestone grew further in the 20th century as commuters moved in, attracted to the surrounding countryside.

Plans to bypass the narrow Roman road through the village were first drawn up before the Second World War, but construction of a dual-carriageway bypass did not begin until 1958. Further dual-carriageway sections of the A12 trunk road were added in the 1960s, to bypass Brentwood and Chelmsford.

==Geology==
Ingatestone lies just to the north of the southernmost limit of glaciation in the British Isles. Surface deposits over much of the area consist of boulder clay and it is only to the north-east that there are more sandy deposits. Geologist Ciara Lovatt conducted several rock mineral experiments on deposits within Ingatestone in the 1980s. The glacial deposits overlie London clay, which can be seen occasionally in the bed of the River Wid and its tributaries.

The geology of the area is responsible for the landscape and the character of farming in surrounding area. Crop farming is the typical use of boulder clay lands. The sandy deposits to the north-east of Ingatestone are a contributory factor in the greater incidence of woodland and non-arable land in this area.

==Places of interest==

Ingatestone Hall has been the home of the Petre family since the 16th century, who reside there to this day. There is a tomb monument to members of the family in the parish church of St Edmund and St Mary&#x27;s.

The hall is currently open as a tourist attraction. It largely retains its Tudor appearance, following restoration carried out between 1915 and 1937, and is set in formal gardens surrounded by eleven acres (4.5 hectares) of grounds. Inside is a range of antique furniture, paintings and other historical artefacts. Queen Elizabeth I spent several nights at the hall on her Royal Progress of 1561. 
St. John Payne, one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, resided at Ingatestone Hall in the late 16th century as chaplain and steward for Lady Petre. He was martyred at Chelmsford in 1582. The smallpox inoculator, Daniel Sutton, made his base on Ingatestone High Street in Brandiston House and carried out much of his work here.

==Economy==

Ingatestone has over a hundred shops and businesses. Among the retail outlets, there are two small supermarkets (Budgens and Co-op) as well as many retail and industrial shops.

There are two public houses in the High Street. The tiny &quot;Star Inn&quot; is the older, dating back to the 15th century. It features low-beamed ceilings and a large, open log fire. &quot;The Bell&quot; is a traditionally styled pub, with a substantial Elizabethan brick fireplace in the lounge bar. A third pub, &quot;The Crown&quot;, was shut after a police raid in 2011 discovered cannabis being grown there. It has now become the Crown Mews development.

==Amenities==

Ingatestone has over 40 clubs and societies, ranging from arts and sports clubs to charitable societies. They include the Ingatestone and Fryerning Dramatic Club, founded in 1947, the Ingatestone Musical and Operetta Group, founded in 1970, the Ingatestone Choral Society, established in 1948, and the Ingatestone and Horticultural Society formed in 1963, which is affiliated to the Royal Horticultural Society. There is also a Community Association, which meets at a large hall in High Street. Other amenities include a recreation ground, a sports field, and bowls and tennis clubs.

The Rotary Club is active and sponsored a war memorial in 2005 to mark the movement&#x27;s centenary. The memorial, in the village&#x27;s Anglican churchyard, is dedicated to the memory of the men of Ingatestone who served and fell in the two world wars.

There are two parks. &quot;Seymour Field&quot; was renamed after &#x27;Skip&#x27; Seymour, a former headteacher of a local school, in 1977; it was known previously as &quot;Transport Meadow&quot;, having been donated to the village by the Ministry of Transport after the construction of the first A12 bypass in 1959. The other park is the &quot;Fairfield&quot;, a historic site of village fairs, which is privately owned by the Petre family and leased to the parish council.

There are four places of worship in Ingatestone: Anglican, Roman Catholic, Elim Pentecostal, and United Reformed.

The local community comes together for key annual events, including a Victorian-themed Christmas evening in the High Street and a free annual firework display on the Fairfield on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Ingatestone has a community magazine called the &quot;Ingatestone Journal&quot;, delivered to residents of Ingatestone, Stock and Margaretting; it covers local issues and events, and allows businesses to advertise their services.

==Local government==
The civil parish for the area is Ingatestone and Fryerning Parish Council. Since 1974, the village has formed a part of the Borough of Brentwood, having previously been part of Chelmsford Rural district, Chelmsford Rural Sanitary District and Chelmsford Poor Law Union.

Historically, the village lay within the administrative area of the Chelmsford Hundred.

Ingatestone has two conservation areas: one covering the railway station and Station Lane, with the other protecting the central shopping area of High Street.

==Education==
Ingatestone has three schools:
* Ingatestone Infant School, teaching children between the ages of four and seven.
* Ingatestone and Fryerning Church Of England Voluntary Aided Junior School, teaching children between the ages of seven and eleven from years 3 to 6. 
* The Anglo European School, a self-governing state school for children aged from eleven to nineteen, specialising in language study. It was the first state school in Britain to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the first to become a Language College.

==Sport==
Ingatestone and Fryerning Cricket Club plays in Divisions 2 and 6 of the T Rippon Mid-Essex League and celebrated its 160th anniversary in 2018. 

The village also has two football teams: Redstones Football Club and Stones Athletic Youth Football Club.

==Notable people==
*The novelist and musician Alice Diehl lived in Ingatestone shortly before her death in 1912.
*Sound poet and musician Henri Chopin lived in an old house by the railway station in the 1970s and 1980s.
*The actress Sarah Miles and her director brother, Christopher Miles, were born in Ingatestone.
*The noted naturalist and entomologist Sheffield Airey Neave lived in the village following retirement.
*Historian and author Ian Yearsley was born in Ingatestone.

==Transport==
The route of the A12 trunk road once passed through the centre of the village, but has since been bypassed. It provides direct access to East London, Chelmsford, Colchester, Ipswich, Harwich and Lowestoft; it also connects to the M25 motorway away.

Ingatestone railway station is a stop on the Great Eastern Main Line. It is served Monday to Saturday by an off-peak service of two Greater Anglia southbound trains an hour to London Liverpool Street, with one each to Clacton-on-Sea and Braintree northbound; rush-hour trains to London are more frequent. On Sundays, there are hourly trains to Liverpool Street and Ipswich.

The village is served by First Essex&#x27;s route 351, which provides regular services to Chelmsford, Brentwood and Warley. School services are operated by First Essex and NIBS Buses.

<text>In theoretical physics, the hypothetical particle called the graviscalar or radion emerges as an excitation of general relativity&#x27;s metric tensor, i.e. gravitational field, but is indistinguishable from a scalar in four dimensions, as shown in Kaluza–Klein theory. The scalar field formula_1 comes from a component of the metric tensor formula_2 where the figure 5 labels an additional fifth dimension. The only variations in the scalar field represent variations in the size of the extra dimension. Also, in models with multiple extra dimensions, there exist several such particles. Moreover, in theories with extended supersymmetry, a graviscalar is usually a superpartner of the graviton that behaves as a particle with spin 0. This concept closely relates to the gauged Higgs models.

<text>Captain John Franks Vallentin, VC (14 May 1882 − 7 November 1914) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Vallentin was born in Lambeth to distiller Grimble Vallentin and Lucy Ann Vallentin née Finnis. He was the nephew of Brevet-Major John Maximilian Vallentin (1865–1901) and of the noted naturalist Rupert Vallentin (1859–1934). His grandfather Sir James Vallentin (1814–1870) was Knight Sheriff of London, and his cousin Archibald Thomas Pechey, the lyricist and author, adapted the family name for his nom de plume &#x27;Valentine&#x27;.

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 6th (Royal Longford and Westmeath Militia) Battalion, Rifle Brigade in 1899, and promoted to lieutenant in the battalion on 25 July 1900. He served in the Second Boer War in South Africa where he was attached to the 3rd (Royal Sussex Militia) Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment. Following the end of hostilities, he left Cape Town on board the &quot;SS Dominion&quot; in August 1902 with the other men of the Royal Sussex, and arrived at Southampton the next month.

He later transferred to a Territorial Force battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment, and then to the Regular Army.

Vallentin was 32 years old, and a captain in the 1st Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the First Battle of Ypres for which he was awarded the VC.

<text>Jeypore is a city in Koraput district in the Indian state of Odisha. It was established by Vir Vikram Dev in the mid 17th century. Dev&#x27;s kingdom was defeated by the East India Company in 1777 who declared it a Zamindari or Feudatory of the British Crown and much later a Princely state until its dissolution in the Dominion of India in 1947.

The erstwhile kingdom was spread over the region of Uttarandhra and Southern Odisha. Geographically, Jeypore is a hilly region surrounded by Eastern Ghats and the Araku hills on three sides like a horseshoe with the western side opening up to Chhattisgarh in central India.

==History==
Before being named ‘Jeypore’ by the Suryavanshi kings, this land was ruled by various dynasties like the Satavahanas, Ikshavakus, Nalas, Gangas and Shilavanshis. In 1443, Vinayak Dev the prince of Northern Kashmir married the only daughter of the Shilavanshi king and inherited the kingdom of Nandapur. He extended his territory while ruling as a vassal ruler under the Gajapati empire. However, after the decline of the Gajapati dynasty, the then Nandapur ruler Vishwanath Dev claimed sovereignty and began ruling as an independent chief in the South Odisha and Northern Andhra Pradesh region under the title of “Nauna-Gajapati”.

According to some sources, Vishwanath was able to extend his kingdom from the boundaries of Bengal in the north to the coast of Godavari in the south. By doing so he rightfully adopted the title of “Gajapati”.

In 1571, after the death of Vishwanath Dev Gajapati, the kingdom under the kinship of his son Balram Dev lost frequent battles to the Qutb Shahi of Golconda and became a tributary kingdom. 

In 1649, Maharaja Veer Vikram Dev abandoned the old capital of Nandapur and founded Jeypore, located amidst hilly ranges and dense forests. It is believed that the continuous intrusion of the Qutb Shahi governor and his military which was weakening the administration of Nandapur forced the king to shift his capital to a strategically viable land. The relationship between the Qutb Shahi Sultan and the Maharaja improved significantly during the reign of Veer Vikram. Nevertheless, Krishna Dev, the successor of Veer Vikram, stopped paying tributes to the Golconda Durbar and claimed independence. In 1674, the next ruler, Vishwambhar Dev defeated the Qutb Shahi Governor of Chicacole who administered on behalf of the Sultan of Golconda and re-established the control of his family over the North Andhra region up to Godavari. This king is known as the father of the feudal system of Jeypore because he established many zamindaris across the North Andhra and South Odisha region.

However, a coup by Balram Dev III against his brother Maharaja Ramchandra Dev in 1710 led to the collapse of the kingdom. Many feudatories of Andhra claimed independence from Jeypore and the kingdom lost a large extent of territory. 

The kingdom faced many challenges but remained sovereign until the advent of the British in 1777. Maharaja Vikram Dev battled the enemies on two fronts but was defeated on both occasions and his kingdom was demoted to a Zamindari for its hostile stance towards the British.

Under the British, the Anglican Church Mission Society focused on developing hospitals and schools. At the end of the 19th century, missionary activity was overseen by B. Baring-Gould including the development of the Robert Money School.

Even as a zamindari, the growth and development of Jeypore continued in the regime of Maharaja Ramchandra Dev III, Maharaja Vikram Dev III, Maharaja Ramchandra Dev IV and the last official ruler, Maharaja Vikram Deo Verma (Vikram Dev IV). 

In 2013, Vishweshvar Chandrachud Dev was crowned as the pretender Maharaja of Jeypore becoming the twenty-seventh king on the 570th anniversary of the dynasty.

==Education==
There are several Odia medium schools in the town such as Government Boys High School, Girls High School, Municipal High School No. I, II and III (girls), Upper Kolab Project High School, Saraswati Sishu vidya mandir, etc. The English medium schools are Modern English School which was established in 1989, Odisha Adarsha Vidyalaya, Jayantigiri, Jeypore which was established by Govt. of Odisha; Jeypore Public school, Deepti Convent School, DAV Model Senior Secondary School, Redwoods English School and Noval Siddharth English Medium School.

Vikram Dev University, which is one of the oldest and prominent educational institutions in Odisha. The institution was started at the present P. G. Block, back then it was known as &#x27;Jeypore College&#x27; from 1 July 1947. As a tribute to the philanthropist king, Rajarshi Vikram Deb Verma, the college was renamed to &quot;Vikram Deb College&quot; in 1961. Honors subjects teaching were imparted from during 1968–73 and Post Graduate courses were started from 1979. The institution was transformed into a university in 2023. The other colleges being Govt. Women&#x27;s College and Law College. Lately many private colleges have started in the town making the environment highly competitive. Among them, prominent are Narayani Junior College and vidwan institute of basic sciences.

Jeypore also has colleges offering professional courses such as Gopal Krushna College of Engineering &amp; Technology, which was established in the year 1989. Jeypore college of Pharmacy is another renowned pharmacy institute. Along with it various Engineering Diploma colleges are present namely Institute of engineering &amp; Management (I.E.M), Hi-Tech Institute of Information &amp; Technology and Jeypore School of Engineering and Technologies.

==Business and economy==
Though traditionally an agrarian economy, Jeypore is the business hub for southern Odisha as well as the bordering towns of Andhra Pradesh. There is high potential growth of this town due to high minerals, opportunities, resources around the district adding to all the facilities like rail, air in this town. There are many renowned industries in and around Jeypore. Business units include Sewa Paper Mills, now a part of BILT, and numerous rice and cashew processing units.

==Transportation==

===Road===
Jeypore is well connected with many cities, including nearby cities lying within its proximity, like Bhubaneswar, Cuttack (both 530 km), Rourkela (575 km), Berhampur (336 km), Jagdalpur (86 km), Sambalpur (394 km), Araku Valley (98 km) and Rayagada (132 km), which include the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, through state and national highways, where daily state and private buses operate to and from the city. The city could be easily reached with the help of NH-26, which passes through it. The under-construction Raipur–Visakhapatnam Expressway will 
pass through Koraput district, thus enhancing connectivity and commute further.

The nearest cities of Andhra Pradesh in proximity to Jeypore are Vizianagaram (165 km), Vishakhapatnam (233 km) and Srikakulam (199 km) and Rajahmundry (345 km), and of Chhattisgarh include Raipur (325 km), Bilaspur (443 km) and Durg (336 km).

<text>HM Fort Roughs is one of several World War II installations that were designed by Guy Maunsell and known collectively as His Majesty&#x27;s Forts or as Maunsell Sea Forts; the purpose of which was to guard the port of Harwich, Essex, and more broadly, the Thames estuary. This 4,500 ton artificial naval installation is similar in some respects to &quot;fixed&quot; offshore oil platforms. It is situated on Rough Sands, a sandbar located approximately from the coast of Suffolk and from the coast of Essex. Today it is the location and &quot;de-facto&quot; capital of the unrecognised, self-proclaimed state of Sealand.

==History==

===1942: Construction, positioning, occupation===

As a contemporary historical society notes, Fort Roughs or the &quot;Rough Towers&quot; was &quot;the first of originally four naval forts designed by G. Maunsell to protect the Thames Estuary.&quot; The artificial sea fort was constructed in dry dock at Red Lion Wharf, Gravesend, in the year preceding and into 1942.

This artificial naval installation is similar in some respects to early &quot;fixed&quot; offshore oil platforms. It consisted of a rectangular reinforced concrete pontoon base with a support superstructure of two tall, diameter hollow reinforced concrete towers, walls roughly thick; overall weight is estimated to have been approximately 4,500 tons. The twin concrete supporting towers were divided into seven floors, four for crew quarters; the remainder provided dining, operational, and storage areas, e.g., for several generators, and for fresh water tanks and antiaircraft munitions. There was a steel framework at one end supporting a landing jetty and crane which was used to hoist supplies aboard; the wooden landing stage itself became known as a &quot;dolphin&quot;.

The towers were joined above the eventual waterline by a steel platform deck upon which other structures could be added; this became a gun deck, on which an upper deck and a central tower unit were constructed. QF 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns were positioned at each end of this main deck, with a further two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns and the central tower radar installations atop a central living area that contained a galley, medical, and officers&#x27; quarters.

The fort was towed from the degaussing station at Tilbury docks by four tugs&quot;Dapper&quot;, &quot;Crested Cock&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Lady Brassey&quot;. Although setting off from Tilbury docks on the morning of 9 February 1942, an eventful journey meant that it did not reach its final destination until 16:00 on 11 February 1942. Held in place by the tug &quot;Dapper&quot;, its base was then intentionally flooded so that it sank in about of water, coming to rest on the sandbar at 16:45. Its location on Rough Sands, approximately 10 miles off the Harwich seafront, was at the time situated in international waters although the superstructure of the vessel above the waterline remained visible from the coast of England.

HM Fort Roughs was in operation within 30 minutes of being launched: the crew had been aboard during the fitting out in harbour and were well acquainted with the fort&#x27;s equipment. Approximately 100 men were assigned to the barge before deployment on Rough Sands; thereafter, the fort was occupied by 150–300 Royal Navy personnel, which continued throughout World War II. At the conclusion of hostilities all original personnel were evacuated from HM Fort Roughs.

===1956: Removal of full-time HMG personnel ===

British government official entities used Roughs Tower for a variety of purposes until 1956 when all full-time personnel were finally removed. Roughs Tower remained identified by name on buoys placed in position by the Ministry of Defence which are maintained under an arrangement with Trinity House. Their purpose is to warn vessels of this obstacle, especially in time of fog because busy shipping lanes criss-cross the area with vessels going to and from the container Port of Felixstowe, Suffolk, and the Port of Harwich, Essex. UK Ordnance Survey now identify the former sea barge fort as Roughs Tower on their charts.

===1966: Occupation===
In 1966 Paddy Roy Bates, who operated Radio Essex, and Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, who operated Radio Caroline, landed on and occupied Fort Roughs. After disagreements, Bates seized the tower as his own. O&#x27;Rahilly attempted to storm the fort in 1967 but Bates thwarted the attack with guns and petrol bombs. As a result the British Royal Marines went to the fort and ordered Bates to surrender and received warning shots fired by Bates&#x27; son Michael. The pair were arrested and charged with weapons offences but the court threw the case out as it did not have jurisdiction beyond the territorial waters of Britain. Bates took this as &quot;de facto&quot; recognition of his country and seven years later issued a constitution, flag, and national anthem, among other things, for the Principality of Sealand (founded on 2 September 1967). In 1978, a German businessman, along with some other Germans and Dutchmen invaded Roughs Tower but Bates recaptured it and finally released them, after a visit by a diplomat from the German embassy in London.

==Location==
According to the Admiralty chart the fort&#x27;s location is at 51°53.71′N 1°28.83′E. The structure is marked by east and west cardinal buoys. Other references (taken from land-based maps) are Ordnance Survey , and on OpenStreetMap within 200 meters of the chart location .

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Bernard William Vann, (9 July 1887 – 3 October 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Also an ordained priest, he was the only cleric of the Church of England to be awarded the VC in the First World War for his actions as a combatant.

==Early life==

Vann was born on 9 July 1887 in Rushden, in Northamptonshire, where his parents, Alfred George Collins Vann and Hannah Elizabeth Vann were teachers. He attended Chichele College, Higham Ferrers, where his father was headmaster.

Vann was a keen footballer who played for amateur teams at Hugglescote United, Irthlingborough, and Northampton Town. During the 1906/1907 season, he played for Burton United, then a League club. He made five appearances that season and then joined Derby County, making the first of his three league appearances for the club on 23 March 1907. Later that year, he played for Leicester Fosse, playing in two non-league games for the club.

From 1907 to 1910, Vann was a student at Jesus College, Cambridge, reading History. His brother, Arthur Harrison Allard Vann, matriculated at Jesus in 1909, aged 25. While at the University of Cambridge, Bernard served in the Officers&#x27; Training Corps as a sergeant. During this time, he played for Mansfield Wesley. In 1910, his final year of studies, he was a hockey blue for the university.

After graduation, Vann taught at Ashby-de-la-Zouch Grammar School in Leicestershire but then decided on a career in the priesthood. He was ordained a deacon in the Church of England in October 1910 and, in December 1911, he was ordained as a priest. He was licensed as a curate at St Barnabas&#x27; Church in the New Humberstone suburb of Leicester and then at St Saviour&#x27;s Church in the same city. In January 1913, he became chaplain and assistant master at Wellingborough School.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Vann volunteered as a military chaplain but, frustrated by difficulties and delays, enlisted in the infantry instead, initially in 28th (County of London) Battalion of The London Regiment, (The Artists&#x27; Rifles). Shortly afterwards, he was commissioned into the 1/8th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) on 1 September 1914.

With his battalion, Vann served in the Ypres Salient for several months from February 1915. In an action at Kemmel on 24 April 1915, a trench he was in was bombed. Although wounded, he organised the defence and rescued buried men under heavy fire. He refused to leave his post until ordered to by his superiors. He was promoted to lieutenant on 26 April 1915 and two months later was made a temporary captain.

Vann further distinguished himself in fighting at Hooge in late July to early August, assisting another officer in holding the line and leading patrols to the German trenches, gathering intelligence. For his actions over this period, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC). On 25 September 1915, his brother Arthur was killed at the Battle of Loos. The following month, Vann was wounded during fighting at the Hohenzollern Redoubt which resulted in him being sent to England for treatment. He returned to the front in June 1916, his captain&#x27;s rank having been made substantive. He soon was promoted to acting major.

In August 1916 Vann received a bar to his previously awarded MC &quot;for conspicuous gallantry in action. He led a daring raid against the enemy&#x27;s trenches, himself taking five prisoners and displaying great courage and determination. He has on many previous occasions done fine work.&quot; Later in the year, suffering neuritis in his neck, he was sent to England for medical treatment. Declared fit in March 1917, he was sent on a command training course and returned to the front six months later as commander of 2/6th Battalion Sherwood Foresters. During this time, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He was promoted to acting lieutenant colonel the following month. On 27 December 1917, at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge, he married Doris Victoria Strange-Beck, a Canadian nurse working at a hospital in England.

For the first part of 1918, Vann spent periods in hospital or on leave. In June 1918, Vann took over command of 1/6th Battalion Sherwood Foresters. On 29 September 1918, during the Battle of St Quentin Canal, he led his battalion across the canal through thick fog and under heavy fire. He secured his troops&#x27; advance by rushing up to the firing line and leading the advance forward himself. Of his battalion, nearly 30 men were killed and over a hundred others were wounded in this engagement. A few days later, on 3 October 1918, he was again leading his battalion, this time across the Beaurevoir-Bonsomme Line, near Ramicourt, when he was killed in action by a sniper.

For his actions of 29 September 1918, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC, the only one of the First World War to be awarded to a cleric of the Church of England performing a combat role, read as follows:
He was survived by his wife, who was pregnant with their son. King George V presented Vann&#x27;s VC to his widow in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 26 November 1919.

Vann was initially buried near where he was killed but in 1920, his remains were moved to Bellicourt British Cemetery in Aisne, France. The inscription on his headstone, &quot;A Great Priest Who Is In His Days Pleased God&quot;, was written by the Bishop of Peterborough.

==Medals and legacy==
Vann&#x27;s medals which, in addition to the VC and the MC &amp; bar, included the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal remained in the family for many years. In May 2010, the VC and the MC and bar were purchased by Lord Ashcroft and are displayed at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum.

Several memorials to Vann&#x27;s memory exist. There is a plaque on the house where he was born in Rushden. At Coates, Gloucestershire, where his family moved after the death of his father, he is listed on the roll of honour at St Matthew&#x27;s Church and on the village war memorial. At the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent where the 8th Sherwood Foresters are commemorated, there is a memorial. A memorial plaque survives in the former St Barnabas&#x27; Church, Leicester, where he was curate.

On 8 November 2014, a plaque honouring Vann and five other Derby County players killed during the First World War was unveiled outside the club&#x27;s Pride Park Stadium.

On 29 September 2018, his grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone in Rushden. His grandson Michael unveiled a memorial plaque in the chapel at Wellingborough School on 10 November 2018.

The Vann Fellowship, named in memory of Vann, was established at Durham University in 2018 to promote the study of Christianity and the armed forces.

<doc id="1191095" wikidata="Q1083340" url="?curid=1191095" title="Miscellaneous Debris">
<text>Miscellaneous Debris is an EP of five cover songs by Primus, released on March 12, 1992. The EP is the first release by the band to feature Les Claypool playing his now-famous fretless six-string Carl Thompson bass, nicknamed the &quot;Rainbow Bass&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the EP as &quot;Primus&#x27; best release&quot;. He notes that the band &quot;plays actual songs instead of sketching out a few ideas as an excuse for jamming&quot;, which means that &quot;&quot;Miscellaneous Debris&quot; isn&#x27;t as weird and alienating as previous albums&quot;, concluding that the band&#x27;s covers &quot;show flashes of brilliance, largely due to the loose yet focused musicianship.&quot;

===Chart performance===
&quot;Miscellaneous Debris&quot; peaked at number 69 on the Australian ARIA singles chart in May 1994. Although the EP never charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, its sole single &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; peaked at number 30 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart February 15, 1992.

<text>Sir Ronald Hibbert Cross, 1st Baronet, (9 May 1896 – 3 June 1968) was a British politician and diplomat. He served as Governor of Tasmania 1951-58.

==Early life and education==
Cross was educated at Ludgrove Preparatory School and then Eton College. He served with the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry and as a pilot with the Royal Flying Corps in World War I.

==Career==
At the 1931 general election, Cross was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Rossendale. He served successively as government whip (1935), Junior Lord of the Treasury (1937), Vice-Chamberlain of the Household (1937–38) and Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade (1938–39). He was sworn into the Privy Council in 1940.

During the Second World War, Cross served as Minister of Economic Warfare (1939–40) and Minister of Shipping (1940–41). In 1941, he was removed as Minister of Shipping after his performance was criticized by the press. The same year, he was appointed British High Commissioner to Australia and created a Baronet, of Bolton-le-Moors in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Cross returned to the United Kingdom in 1945 but lost his seat at that year&#x27;s election.

In 1950, Cross was elected in the seat of Ormskirk, Lancashire.
He later served as Governor of Tasmania from 23 August 1951 to 4 June 1958. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) by Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Hobart during her Coronation Tour in 1954. He was later appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1955 New Year Honours. He was a popular governor, well regarded in the island State.

Cross married Louise Marion Green-Emmott in 1925. They had four daughters and a son who predeceased him.
