<text>Sargassum is a genus of brown macroalgae (seaweed) in the order Fucales of the Phaeophyceae class. Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. Most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold-water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, but the genus &quot;Sargassum&quot; appears to be an exception. The species within Sargassum are normally benthic, but some of the species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather. Two species (&quot;S. natans&quot; and &quot;S. fluitans&quot;) have become holopelagic—reproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycles. The Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of &quot;Sargassum&quot;.

The size of annual blooms in the Atlantic increased by over a hundred-fold, starting in 2011, as a result of factors including increased fertilizer runoff in major rivers such as the Amazon and Congo.

== History ==
&quot;Sargassum&quot; was named by the Portuguese sailors who found it in the Sargasso Sea. They called it after the wooly rock rose (&quot;Halimium lasianthum&quot;) that grew in their water wells at home, and that was called &quot;sargaço&quot; in Portuguese () - from the Latin &quot;salicastrum&quot;.
The Florida Keys and mainland South Florida are well known for the high levels of &quot;Sargassum&quot; covering their shores. &quot;Sargassum&quot; or gulfweed was observed by Columbus. Although the seaweed acquired a legendary reputation for covering the entirety of the Sargasso Sea, making navigation impossible,
it has since been found to occur only in drifts.

&quot;Sargassum&quot; species are cultivated and cleaned for use as an herbal remedy. Many Chinese herbalists prescribe powdered &quot;Sargassum&quot;—either the species &quot;S. pallidum&quot;, or more rarely, hijiki, &quot;S. fusiforme&quot;—in doses of 0.5 grams dissolved in warm water and drunk as a tea. It is called in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is used to resolve &quot;heat phlegm&quot;.

&quot;Sargassum&quot; (&quot;F. Sargassaceae&quot;) is an important seaweed excessively distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. Different species of &quot;Sargassum&quot; have folk applications in human nutrition and are considered a rich source of vitamins, carotenoids, proteins, and minerals. Many bioactive chemical compounds that are classified as terpenoids, sterols, sulfated polysaccharides, polyphenols, sargaquinoic acids, sargachromanol, and pheophytin were isolated from different &quot;Sargassum&quot; species. These isolated compounds and/or extracts exhibit diverse biological activities, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-microbial, anti-tumor, fibrinolytic, immune-modulatory, anticoagulant, hepatoprotective, and anti-viral activities.

== Description ==

Species of this genus of algae may grow to a length of several metres. They are generally brown or dark green in color and consist of a holdfast, a stipe, and a frond. Oogonia and antheridia occur in conceptacles embedded in receptacles on special branches. Some species have berrylike gas-filled bladders that help the fronds float to promote photosynthesis. Many have a rough, sticky texture that, along with a robust but flexible body, help them withstand strong water currents.

== Ecology ==
Large, pelagic mats of &quot;Sargassum&quot; in the Sargasso Sea act as one of the only habitats available for ecosystem development; this is because the Sargasso Sea lacks any land boundaries. The &quot;Sargassum&quot; patches act as a refuge for many species in different parts of their development, but also as a permanent residence for endemic species that can only be found living on and within the &quot;Sargassum&quot;. These endemic organisms have specialized patterns and colorations that mimic the &quot;Sargassum&quot; and allow them to be impressively camouflaged in their environment. In total, these &quot;Sargassum&quot; mats are home to more than 11 phyla and over 100 different species. There is also a total of 81 fish species (36 families represented) that reside in the &quot;Sargassum&quot; or utilize it for parts of their life cycles. Other marine organisms, such as young sea turtles, will use the &quot;Sargassum&quot; as shelter and a resource for food until they reach a size at which they can survive elsewhere. This community is being affected by humans due to overfishing, trash and other types of pollution, and boat traffic, which could eventually lead to the demise of this diverse and unique habitat. Below is a list of organisms that are associated with the &quot;Sargassum&quot; in the Sargasso Sea.

The Sargasso Sea plays a major role in the migration of catadromous eel species such as the European eel, the American eel, and the American conger eel. The larvae of these species hatch within the sea and as they grow they travel to Europe or the East Coast of North America. Later in life, the matured eel migrates back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn and lay eggs. It is also believed that after hatching, young loggerhead sea turtles use currents, such as the Gulf Stream, to travel to the Sargasso Sea, where they use the &quot;Sargassum&quot; as cover from predators until they are mature.

&quot;Sargassum&quot; also serve as a trophic link between the ocean surface and the seabed. Isopods of the species &quot;Bathyopsurus nybelini&quot; at depths of 5002–6288 m in the Puerto Rico Trench and Mid-Cayman spreading center have been observed consuming &quot;Sargassum&quot;. They even exhibit several adaptations for it, such as microbiomes capable of breaking down the seaweed and fixing nitrogen, specialized swimming strokes, and serrated, grinding mouthparts.

&quot;Sargassum&quot; is commonly found in the beach drift near &quot;Sargassum&quot; beds, where they are also known as gulfweed, a term that also can mean all seaweed species washed up on shore.

&quot;Sargassum&quot; species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where &quot;Sargassum&quot; beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks, or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature.
In tropical &quot;Sargassum&quot; species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins occurs.

== &quot;Coastal inundations&quot; by washed-ashore &quot;Sargassum&quot; ==

In limited amounts, washed-ashore &quot;Sargassum&quot; plays an important role in maintaining Atlantic and Caribbean coastal ecosystems. Once ashore, &quot;Sargassum&quot; provides vital nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus to coastal ecosystems which border the nutrient-poor waters of the western North Atlantic tropics and subtropics. Additionally, it decreases coastal erosion.

Beginning in 2011, unprecedented quantities of &quot;Sargassum&quot; began inundating coastal areas in record amounts. Coastlines in Brazil, the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the east coast of Florida saw quantities of &quot;Sargassum&quot; wash ashore up to three feet deep. The first major &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation event occurred in 2011 and had a biomass increase of 200 fold compared to the previous eight years average bloom size. Since 2011 increasingly stronger inundation events have occurred every 2–3 years. During a &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation event in 2018, one &quot;Sargassum&quot; bloom measured over 1600 square kilometers, more than three times the average size. Recent inundation events have caused millions of dollars of lost revenue in the tourism industry, especially hurting small Caribbean countries whose economies are highly dependent on seasonal tourism.

While the Sargasso Sea is a known source of &quot;Sargassum&quot; blooms, variations in the &quot;Sargassum&quot; types composing these inundation events have led researchers to believe that the Sargasso Sea is not the point of origin of inundating &quot;Sargassum&quot;. &quot;Sargassum natans I&quot; and &quot;Sargassum fluitans III&quot; are the dominant &quot;Sargassum&quot; species found in the Sargasso Sea. Recent net sampling studies have found &quot;Sargassum natans VIII&quot;, a previously rare type, is constituting a dominating percentage of &quot;Sargassum&quot; biodiversity in the Western Atlantic and Sargasso Sea.

=== Biological impacts ===
Unprecedented &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation events cause a range of biological and ecological impacts in affected regions. The decomposition of large quantities of &quot;Sargassum&quot; along coastlines consumes oxygen, creating large oxygen-depleted zones resulting in fish kills. Decomposing &quot;Sargassum&quot; additionally creates hydrogen sulfide gas (), which causes a range of health impacts in humans. During the &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation event in 2018, 11,000 Acute &quot;Sargassum&quot; Toxicity cases were reported in an 8-month span on just the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Massive amounts of floating &quot;Sargassum&quot; present a physical barrier preventing corals and seagrasses from receiving sufficient light, fouling boat propellers, and entangling marine turtles and mammals. With every &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation event, large amounts of nutrients are transported from the open ocean to coastal environments. This greatly increases nutrient transport, and its effect on marine and coastal ecosystems are still unknown. Understanding the causes and drivers of &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundations is critical as they become more commonplace.

Sargassum can harm wildlife and water quality. But companies like Algas Organics clean beaches and use it to make plant fertilizer and pulp. The company said Georgia Pacific and Procter &amp; Gamble work with it.

=== Nutrient factors ===

The Sargasso Sea, a known source area for &quot;Sargassum&quot; blooms, is classified as an oligotrophic region. With warm, oxygen-poor waters and low nutrient contents, biomass production is limited by what little nutrients are present. Historically, low nutrient levels in the Sargasso Sea have limited &quot;Sargassum&quot; production. New influxes of nitrogen and phosphorus are driving factors in increased biomass production.

Recent studies have found three likely drivers of nutrient influx linked to increasing &quot;Sargassum&quot; biomass: an increase in nutrient output from the Amazon River, increased nutrients in the Gulf of Mexico, and coastal upwelling off the West African Coast which transfers deep nutrient-rich waters to the upper water column where &quot;Sargassum&quot; resides. Nutrient output from the Amazon River has been shown to have a direct delayed effect on large inundation events, which occur one to two years after years of high nutrient output. Phosphates and iron transported via the trade winds from North Africa have been reported to have a fertilizing effect on &quot;Sargassum&quot; growth; further data is required to understand its role in causing inundating blooms. Researchers globally agree that continued research is required to quantify the effect of marine chemical changes and other environmental factors in the recent increase in &quot;Sargassum&quot; biomass and inundation events.

=== Currents and winds ===
The physical drivers behind &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation events are prevailing winds and ocean surface currents. The Caribbean is located in a region heavily affected by Trade winds. Trade winds are strong, consistent northeasterlies winds which blow dust-filled dry air from the Sahara across the Atlantic. Trade winds additionally play a critical role in the annual hurricane season in the Western Atlantic. The Caribbean Current and Antilles branch of the Atlantic North Equatorial Current are the major current transporters of &quot;Sargassum&quot; in the region. 
Researchers have recently begun using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery and ocean current data to track and forecast inundation events with a high level of accuracy.

=== Human effects ===
The effects of deforestation, waste-water runoff, and commercial agriculture fertilizer on facilitating the excess accumulation of nutrients in aquatic and marine environments have been well studied and shown to be driving factors in eutrophication. Since detrimental &quot;Sargassum&quot; inundation events did not begin until 2011, it is likely that an unknown nutrient threshold was reached and surpassed. Given current agricultural policies and practices, it is unlikely these inundation events will disappear on their own without human intervention.

=== As food ===
Japanese cuisine as well as Chile have traditionally consumed &quot;Sargassum&quot;, known as hijiki, although it contains high amounts of arsenic, part of the arsenic cycle from groundwater, waterways, into oceans and back to land. There are methods to process and greatly reduce arsenic from this genus of seaweed, potentially making it a nearly inexhaustible food supply for animals or people.

=== Climate change ===
Variations in sea level, salinity, water temperature, chemical composition, rainfall patterns, and water acidity all play roles in regulating algae blooms. As anthropogenic forces increase the variability of these factors, the frequency, duration, severity and geographic range of harmful algae blooms have increased, causing millions of dollars of lost revenue as well as damaging fragile coastal and coral ecosystems.

<text>David Fairclough (born 5 January 1957) is an English retired professional footballer, most famous for playing for Liverpool as a striker during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Life and playing career==
Known affectionately as &quot;Supersub&quot; (because he was a talented goalscorer who, in comparison with other players, rarely started matches for Liverpool – but frequently came into the match as a substitute to make an impact), Fairclough was born in inner city Liverpool and as a child moved to the new Cantril Farm housing estate in the 1960s due to slum clearances. He rose through the Liverpool ranks as a teenager and made his debut for the club on 1 November 1975 in the 1–0 league win over Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. As the season progressed, Fairclough scored seven crucial goals in just 14 appearances to land Liverpool the League championship. Nine of these appearances were as substitute. His first goal for the club came three days after his debut on 4 November 1975, during the 6–0 defeat of Spanish side Real Sociedad at Anfield in a UEFA Cup 2nd round 2nd leg tie.

The pecking order of strikers at the club saw Fairclough trailing behind the &#x27;dream duo&#x27; of Kevin Keegan and John Toshack, as well as England centre forward David Johnson. In the 1976–77 season, Fairclough made more appearances as a substitute, because of a succession of injuries to Toshack.

His most famous Liverpool goal came at Anfield as a substitute in a crucial European Cup quarter final against the French side St Etienne. Liverpool had been a goal adrift from the first leg in France, and when they went 2–1 up in the home return, the aggregate score was level at 2–2 but St Etienne led on the away goals rule. Liverpool&#x27;s manager Bob Paisley sent Fairclough on in the last 20 minutes of the game and with six minutes remaining, Fairclough ran on to a long ball upfield and held off two St Etienne defenders to score the tie&#x27;s decisive goal at the Kop end. ITV commentator Gerald Sinstadt remarked: &quot;Supersub strikes again!&quot;

Liverpool won the League title again and reached both the FA Cup final at Wembley and the European Cup final in Rome. Fairclough was not selected for the Wembley squad as Paisley named veteran winger Ian Callaghan as the substitute, and Liverpool lost to Manchester United. However, he was a substitute in Rome as Liverpool won 3–1.

The following season, Fairclough scored a goal in each leg as Liverpool thrashed Keegan&#x27;s Hamburger SV 7–1 on aggregate in the European Super Cup. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again and this time Fairclough started the match. A 1–0 victory over Bruges retained the trophy for Liverpool. He managed 29 league appearances that season, scoring 10 goals, but the Reds were beaten to both the league title and the Football League Cup by newly promoted Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough.

In 1978–79, Liverpool regained their league championship crown but Fairclough did not play enough games to seal another title medal, as he had played just four times in the league, scoring twice.

Fairclough scored his only Liverpool hat-trick on 9 February 1980 in the thrilling 5–3 league victory over Norwich City at Carrow Road. His goals came in the 4th, 18th and 75th minutes, with Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Case scoring to guarantee a late win for the Reds. However, Fairclough&#x27;s league chances were again restricted that season, as he played just 14 league games and scored five goals. He came on as a substitute in the League Cup semi final second leg against Nottingham Forest four days after his hat trick at Norwich, and scored a late equaliser to preserve Liverpool&#x27;s long two-year unbeaten run at Anfield. Even though Liverpool went out on aggregate to Forest, Fairclough&#x27;s goal helped create an English record of eighty five unbeaten matches in succession at home.

Fairclough spent another five years at Anfield, although in what was a golden era for the club, he was rarely in the first team. He was a prolific scorer in the reserves, but the phenomenal partnership of Dalglish and Ian Rush rendered him surplus to first team requirements. In the 1982–83 season he scored three times in eight league appearances but failed to play enough games to merit a title medal. He had also failed to make the squad for the League Cup victories of the previous two seasons, and in the 1981–82 season, when the Reds won another league title as well as the League Cup, he did not play a single first team game.

The &quot;Supersub&quot; tag belied the number of first team starts Fairclough made at Liverpool; of his 153 appearances, only 61 were from the bench. He scored 55 goals (34 of them in the league), averaging a goal every 2.8 games.

Fairclough left Liverpool on 4 July 1983 after a loan spell at NASL side Toronto Blizzard. He then moved to the Swiss side FC Lucerne before returning to England for spells with Manchester City, Norwich, Oldham Athletic and Rochdale. He moved overseas once more to Belgium club Beveren for three seasons before returning home for stints with Tranmere Rovers and Wigan Athletic. He ended his playing days at non-league Knowsley.

==Later life and legacy==

Fairclough now works as a pundit and also on the after-dinner circuit.

Fairclough is still a firm favourite amongst the Anfield faithful and was voted in at No.18 on the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop. The poll was conducted by the Reds official web-site, 110,000 supporters worldwide took part listing their favourite 10 Liverpool players of all time.

Fairclough&#x27;s 18th place was higher than John Toshack&#x27;s 34th and David Johnson&#x27;s 77th positions, two of the players that prevented Fairclough from gaining more Liverpool appearances.

Fairclough was married to Jan Fairclough who died on 9 April 2011. Jan collapsed suddenly on the morning of 6 April of a brain haemorrhage and died 3 days later. A minute of silence was held for Jan (as well as the 96 Hillsborough victims and Mark Burgan, a soldier from Liverpool) at Anfield before a Liverpool vs. Manchester City match on 11 April 2011. Fairclough and Jan have two children, Tom and Sophie.

Fairclough suffered a minor heart attack on 3 October 2010, at the age of 53, but made a full recovery.

<doc id="1198407" wikidata="Q5122270" url="?curid=1198407" title="Cissy Patterson">
<text>Eleanor Josephine Medill &quot;Cissy&quot; Patterson, Countess Gizycki (November 7, 1881 – July 24, 1948) was an American journalist and newspaper editor, publisher and owner. She was one of the first women to head a major daily newspaper, the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; in Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Elinor Josephine Patterson was born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 7, 1881, to the daughter of Robert and Elinor &quot;Nellie&quot; ( Medill) Patterson. She would change the spelling of her first name to &quot;Eleanor&quot; as an adult, but would mostly be known as &quot;Cissy,&quot;. Her grandfather, Joseph Medill, was Mayor of Chicago and owned the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, which later passed into the hands of another Medill grandchild, her first cousin Colonel Robert R. McCormick. Cissy&#x27;s older brother, who for a time was also involved in the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Joseph Medill Patterson, was the founder of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

==Education and marriage==
She was educated at Miss Porter&#x27;s School in Farmington, Connecticut. When her uncle Robert S. McCormick was named ambassador to Austria-Hungary, she accompanied him and his wife, Cissy&#x27;s maternal aunt Kate, to Vienna. There, she met Count Josef Gizycki and fell in love with him, a romance not interrupted even by her return to America, where she lived in Washington, D.C. In Washington, she was a leading light in society, where the press labeled Alice Roosevelt (daughter of Theodore), Marguerite Cassini (daughter of Arthur Cassini, the Russian ambassador to the U.S.A., mother to Oleg Cassini), and Cissy the &quot;Three Graces.&quot; Count Gizycki came to America, and they were married in Washington on April 14, 1904, despite her family&#x27;s objections.

A daughter was born to them on September 3, 1905, and was named Felicia Leonora (1905–1999). Cissy went with the Count to his home, a vast feudal manor in Russian Poland. Their family life did not go well. They separated and rejoined several times, but Cissy eventually set herself on leaving. She took their child, hiding her in a house near London, but the Count pursued her and kidnapped their daughter, hiding her in an Austrian convent. Cissy filed for divorce, which took thirteen years to obtain.

==Business dealings and social life==
After her experience abroad, she moved to Lake Forest, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, but she returned to Washington in 1913. In 1920, her brother Joseph finally succumbed to his sister&#x27;s pleas and allowed her to write for his &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, founded the previous year. She also worked for William Randolph Hearst. She published two novels, &quot;romans à clef&quot;, &quot;Glass Houses&quot; (1926) and &quot;Fall Flight&quot; (1928), part of her feud with former friend Alice Roosevelt Longworth. In 1925, Eleanor married Elmer Schlesinger, a New York lawyer. He died four years later, and in 1930, Mrs. Schlesinger legally changed her name to Mrs. Eleanor Medill Patterson.

Patterson tried to buy Hearst&#x27;s two Washington papers, the morning &quot;Washington Herald&quot; and the evening &quot;Washington Times&quot;. However, Hearst hated to sell anything, even when he needed the money. Although he had never made money from his Washington papers, he refused to give up the prestige of owning papers in the capital. However, Hearst agreed to make Patterson the papers&#x27; editor at the urging of his editor Arthur Brisbane. 

&quot;...And Cissy, although she had no education to speak of and she had very little journalistic experience, seemed to have some of that gift. One of the things she did when William Randolph Hearst allowed her to run his &quot;Washington Herald&quot;, which was running fifth in a six-paper market in 1930, she immediately started making changes, the kind of changes that her brother would have made. She added a lot of local features, a lot of local color. She hired a lot of local writers, rather than use the, as she put it, “canned stuff” that came off the Hearst wires.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amanda/JFK/Cissy&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Smith, 2011

&quot;She revitalized the paper and promptly changed the Times from a staid and plodding publication to one more vitally interested in the most tawdry murders to women’s issues and society columns. The addition of coverage of much of Washington’s glittering society appealed to women readers, as did articles on food and fashion. Cissy hired several women to write for the Times and her changes had the effect of propelling the Washington Herald to one of the leading newspapers in Washington, D. C. It wasn’t long before Cissy Patterson had doubled the circulation of the Herald, a feat William Randolph Hearst himself had not been able to accomplish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kF/Cissy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; - Ray Hill, The Knoxville Focus, 

She began work on August 1, 1930. Patterson was a hands-on editor who insisted on the best of everything—writing, layout, typography, images, and comics. She encouraged society reporting and the women&#x27;s page and hired many women as reporters, including Adela Rogers St. Johns and Martha Blair. In 1936, she was invited to join the American Society of Newspaper Editors.

In April 1931, Patterson purchased Mount Airy, a mansion built by Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore in the 1600s. Located on extensive grounds near Rosaryville, Maryland, since about 1910 the mansion&#x27;s owners had operated it as Dower House, an exclusive restaurant, but it suffered a severe fire in February 1931. Patterson not only meticulously restored the mansion, but improved the stables, added a guest house, and built a greenhouse for growing orchids.

In 1937, Hearst&#x27;s finances had worsened, and he agreed to lease the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot; to Patterson with an option to buy. Eugene Meyer, the man who had outbid Hearst and Patterson for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1933, tried to buy the &quot;Herald&quot; out from under Patterson, but failed. Instead, she bought both papers from Hearst on January 28, 1939, and merged them as the &quot;Times-Herald&quot;.

&quot;Henry Luce, husband of Clare Booth Luce, sometime playwright and Congresswoman, was the owner of the august TIME magazine and LIFE, among other publications. His dislike for Cissy was likely in part for Cissy’s tart dismissal of his wife as “that lovely asp” and he derided Cissy’s newspaper as “Cissy’s henhouse.” Cissy did indeed use her newspaper to punish her enemies as well as publicly pick at issues sure to appeal to her readers.&quot; - Ray Hill, The Knoxville Focus, 

During the 1930s, Patterson was generally supportive of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Her friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt was particularly close. Although her &quot;Times-Herald&quot;, along with brother Joe Patterson&#x27;s &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, endorsed the president for a third term in 1940, both turned against his foreign policy by early 1941. They feared that he was needlessly drawing the U.S. into a foreign war. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, both Cissy and Joe immediately offered their full support to the war effort but the president, rebuffed them, warning that Cissy needed to &quot;behave herself.&quot; &quot;Roosevelt could easily have converted both Pattersons to his cause,&quot; writes Cissy&#x27;s biographer, Ralph G. Martin. &quot;Instead, he created two bitter and powerful enemies.&quot; Furthermore, Roosevelt urged Attorney General Francis Biddle and other officials to intensify investigations against the so-called &quot;McCormick-Patterson Axis.&quot;

In 1942, after the Battle of Midway, the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; ran a &quot;Tribune&quot; story that the U.S. had advance knowledge about the movements of the Japanese attack force. The story did not report that the U.S. had broken the Japanese naval code, but that was a natural conclusion the enemy could make from the content. Roosevelt, furious, had the &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; indicted for espionage but backed down because of the publicity, charges he was persecuting his enemies, and the likelihood of an acquittal (since the Navy&#x27;s censors had twice cleared the story before it was published and the Code of Wartime Practices said nothing about the movement of enemy ships). Attorney General Biddle said that the government&#x27;s humiliation in the case made him feel &quot;like a fool.&quot;

During World War II, she and her brother were accused of being Nazi sympathizers even though both had endorsed the president in the previous three elections. Representative Elmer Holland of Pennsylvania said on the floor of the United States House of Representatives that the Pattersons &quot;would welcome the victory of Hitler.&quot;

==Family difficulties==
She feuded with her daughter, who publicly &quot;divorced&quot; her in 1945, and with her former son-in-law, Drew Pearson, by whom she had a granddaughter, Ellen Cameron Pearson Arnold (1926–2010). An alcoholic for most of her adult life, she died of a heart attack at age 66 at Mount Airy. She left the paper to seven of her editors, who sold it to her cousin Colonel McCormick within the year. He held onto the paper for five years, and although he seemed close to returning it to profitability for several years, it eventually proved too significant a financial drain. After sounding out several other publishers quietly, McCormick opted to sell the paper to the rival &quot;Post&quot;, which promptly closed it.

As Countess Gizycki, Patterson was a frequent visitor to her ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in the 1920s, where Donald Hough records an unexpected aspect of her personality: the ability to speak effectively to horses in language worthy of a native cowboy. The Flat Creek Ranch is now on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Captain 3rd Rank Valery Mikhailovich Sablin () (1 January 1939 – 3 August 1976) was a Soviet Navy officer and a member of the Communist Party. In November 1975, in response to what he claimed was rampant corruption and stagnation in the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev, he led a mutiny on the Soviet anti-submarine frigate &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; (, tr. , meaning &quot;Sentry&quot;) in an attempt to start a Leninist political revolution. His mutiny failed and he was executed for treason nine months later.

The &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; mutiny inspired the Tom Clancy novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, which was adapted into a 1990 film of the same name.

==Early life==
Valery Mikhailovich Sablin was born on 1 January 1939 in Leningrad as the son of Mikhail Petrovich Sablin, who was also a Naval officer. Sablin studied in Frunze Naval Institute in 1956 and was graduated on 1960. Sablin also joined the CPSU in 1959. Having received the specialty of a naval artilleryman, in December 1960, Sablin began serving in the Northern Fleet as an assistant to the commander of the 130-mm gun battery of the Skory-class destroyer &quot;Ozhestochenny&quot;. On November 2nd of 1961, Sablin was transferred to a new duty station as the commander of the artillery fire control group on the newest Kotlin-class destroyer &quot;Svedushchiy&quot;.

He was never afraid to openly express his opinions. In 1962, when he was 23, he wrote a letter to Nikita Khrushchev, outlining his thoughts on the purity of the party ranks and requesting him to &quot;rid the Communist Party of sycophants and corrupt elements.&quot; Sablin was lucky to avoid serious discipline, instead being reprimanded and having his first promotion delayed for almost a year. Sablin continued to serve in the Northern Fleet in as an assistant commander until 1969, where he entered the Lenin Military-Political Academy and studied there. He then graduated with honors in 1973 with his name engraved on a marble plaque among the names of other top graduates of the academy. Captain Nikolay Cherkashin, one of Sablin&#x27;s colleagues, recalled: He had always thought globally… He tried to deeply understand social phenomena. He was a natural politician.

==Naval career==
After graduating from the academy on 29 June 1973, Captain 3rd Rank Sablin then was appointed as a political officer on the Destroyer &quot;Bditelny&quot; of the 128th Brigade of the 12th Division of missile ships of the Baltic Fleet. However, while Sablin was on post-academic leave, the political officer Captain-Lieutenant Podraikin from an Burevestnik-class missile frigate &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; (which was part of the 128th Brigade) was dismissed from the ship for drunkenness. Thus, upon arrival in Baltiysk on 13 August, Sablin was appointed to &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; to replace him.

The &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; was still a new ship, its crew was just being formed. The officers had a lot of work, and Sablin did not yet have the opportunity to implement his plan to use the warship as a &quot;tribune&quot; from which a signal could be given by radio to begin changes in the country.

In October 1974, the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; went to Rostock to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. After returning from Rostock, the crew of &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; was supplemented with personnel, and on 1 January 1975, as part of a detachment of ships of the Baltic Fleet, the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; went on combat duty in the Mediterranean Sea with a subsequent call to Cuba. During the combat duty, Sablin studied the crew and gradually acquainted some of its members with his views and ideas, finding like-minded people among them. On May 1st of 1975, the ship returned to Baltiysk. Following the combat duty, Anatoly Potulny (the captain of the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot;), and Sablin were awarded the Order for Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR, 3rd Class.

==Mutiny on the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot;==
Sablin&#x27;s opportunity to act came in the autumn of 1975, when the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; was sent to Liepāja for scheduled repairs, but before that it received orders to take part in a naval parade in Riga dedicated to the 58th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

On 6 November, the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; arrived at the Riga roadstead and moored at the designated mooring buoy. Where it was ordered to remain until the morning of November 9th, after which it would proceed to Liepāja for repairs. On 8 November, at about 11 P.M, Sablin told his captain Potulny that there were some sailors that needed to be disciplined for being drunk on duty in the lower deck. But when they arrived at the lower deck to investigate, Sablin led the captain into entering an unused cargo hold and locked him inside. Thus, Sablin effectively took control of the ship. After that, he gathered 15 senior officers in the midshipman&#x27;s wardroom. There, a vote was held among the 15 officers present. Having previously armed himself with a loaded pistol, he explained his views and plans. In particular, he announced that the leadership of the USSR had abandoned the Leninist principles and explains about the social inequalities between the lives of party officials, who lives in lavish lifestyles by using their power for personal gains while the majority of regular Soviet citizens and workers were still far lagged behind. Eight officers voted in favor of the mutiny. The remaining seven officers who voted against the mutiny were detained. 

Then Sablin gathered the ship&#x27;s crew and announced that most of the officers were on his side. He also encouraged the rest of the crew to support him. Sablin&#x27;s plans were disrupted by the ship&#x27;s electrical engineer, Senior Lieutenant Firsov, who managed to leave the ship unnoticed at 2:55 A.M. Firsov, who voted in favor of the mutiny, only used the vote to slip away and alert the port garrison about the situation on the ship, thereby depriving Sablin of the time advantage. After all, everyone knew that the ship had to go for repairs, and the ship&#x27;s departure from the port should have aroused any suspicions. After Firsov&#x27;s escape, Sablin began to act quick. Sablin immediately led the ship out of the port and directed it toward the exit from the Gulf of Riga under the cover of the darkness. 

Sablin&#x27;s plan was to take the ship from the Gulf of Riga north into the Gulf of Finland and to Leningrad, through the Neva River, mooring by the decommissioned cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; (the symbol of the Russian Revolution), where he would protest by radio and television to the public against the rampant corruption of the Brezhnev era. He planned to say what he thought many were saying privately: that the revolution and motherland were in danger; that the ruling authorities were up to their necks in corruption, demagoguery, graft, and lies, leading the country into an abyss; that the ideals of Communism had been discarded; and that there was a pressing need to revive Leninist principles of justice. Sablin was a strong believer in Leninist values and considered the Soviet system to have essentially &quot;sold out&quot;.

When the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; cleared the mouth of the Gulf of Riga, ten bombers and reconnaissance airplanes, accompanied with thirteen warships were in pursuit. Several attempts to force the ship to surrender by the pursuing vessels were made, but Sablin reluctantly refused their orders. So the pursuers fired a number of warning shots across her bows. Several bombs were dropped in front of and behind the ship. Then a bomb impacted the &quot;Storozhevoy&#x27;s&quot; stern and the steering was damaged and she eventually came to a stop. As pressure from the bombardment and the imminent failure of the mutiny intensified, the sailors freed Potulny and the rest of the captive officers. They went up to the bridge, shot Sablin in the leg and then shouted orders to the pursuing vessels through the radio: &quot;Cease firing! We have regained control of the ship!&quot;. The injured Sablin and his supporters were detained. Not long after, the pursuing vessels finally closed in and the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; was boarded by Soviet marine commandos without any serious resistance from the mutineers. Leningrad was still 400 miles away.

Upon return to port, Sablin was brutally beaten, and imprisoned by the KGB. While in custody he was starved, tortured, interrogated and provided only minimal medical attention. He was subsequently charged with treason, court-martialled in June 1976 and found guilty, being sentenced to death by firing squad. His second-in-command during the mutiny, Alexander Shein, received an eight-year prison sentence. All of the senior officers (even the ones who voted against the mutiny) were demoted and dishonorably discharged. The rest of the mutineers were freed.

==Death and legacy==
Sablin was allowed to meet his wife and son for the last time on 18 July 1976, and his father two days later on 20 July. They received no subsequent news on him, leading his father to write a letter to KGB chief Yuri Andropov on 7 January 1977. Sablin&#x27;s father died a few weeks later, never finding out the fate of his son. It is unknown if the letter ever reached Andropov, but the KGB subsequently sent death certificates of Sablin to his younger brother and wife between February and March 1977. The document left out the cause and place of death, but stated that Sablin had died on 3 August 1976. In the intervening seven months, his personal effects were reportedly destroyed and KGB representatives claimed they were under no obligation to inform his relations of his death until they received the letter of inquiry from his father. He was presumably executed in Lefortovo Prison, but his remains were never returned to his family and his final resting place remains unknown.

In 1994, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation reviewed the sentences with a possibility of posthumous rehabilitation. The court partially rehabilitated Sablin rather than fully exonerating him and Shein (who had by that time served his sentence). Sablin was cleared of the charge of treason, but was instead found guilty of charges related to insubordination and actions exceeding his authority.

==Reports of the mutiny in America==
The Kremlin did not want news of the uprising to spread and was therefore willing, perhaps even prepared, to present it to world public opinion as an attempted defection to Sweden – contrary to Sablin&#x27;s intentions. The Gulf of Riga can be left northward only through a narrow passage between the Estonian islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa and the mainland. A ship making for Leningrad from Riga that wishes to avoid such confined conditions must initially head west toward the Swedish island of Gotland. Sablin steered this course, which could give the mistaken impression that the &quot;Storozhevoy&quot; was heading to Sweden or even NATO-member Denmark instead of Leningrad. Until the end of the Cold War, American intelligence believed that the crew had planned to defect.

Gregory D. Young was the first American to investigate the mutiny as part of his 1982 Masters thesis &quot;Mutiny on Storozhevoy: A Case Study of Dissent in the Soviet Navy&quot;, and later in the book &quot;The Last Sentry&quot; by Young and Nate Braden. The thesis was placed in the United States Naval Academy archives where it was read by Tom Clancy, then an insurance salesman, who used it as inspiration to write &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

<doc id="1198415" wikidata="Q583094" url="?curid=1198415" title="Ragnarok (manhwa)">
<text>is a manhwa created by Lee Myung-jin and published by Daiwon C.I. in South Korea from 1998 to 2001. There are currently 10 volumes in circulation, which were republished in English in North America by Tokyopop from May 21, 2002, to April 6, 2004.

The series is mainly based on Norse mythology but is influenced by various other cultures. It falls into the genres of fantasy, action and adventure.

This manhwa became the basis of the widely popular Korean MMORPG, &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; developed by Gravity Corp, which in turn was the basis for an adaptation into the anime &quot;Ragnarok the Animation&quot;. Currently, &quot;Ragnarok&quot; is on indefinite hiatus as Lee Myung-jin is helping with the development of &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;.

==Story==
&quot;Ragnarok&quot; follows the life and adventures of the warrior Chaos, an amnesiac who cannot remember anything from before the last two years in his life. He resides in the city of Fayon, inhabited by a long lineage of warriors. The newest leader in line to claim the head position of the village is a young woman by the name of Iris Irine, who trains with Chaos, her close friend, to become a suitable leader for her people. Meanwhile, Fenris Fenrir searches for Balder&#x27;s reincarnation to bring about Ragnarok.

==Characters==
===Protagonists===
* Chaos: A Rune Knight who has lost the memory of his childhood. Chaos came to live in Fayon, a village of great warriors, and became best friends with Iris Irine, the heir to leadership of the village. When Fenris Fenrir arrived in Fayon, Chaos learned that he was the reincarnation of Balder, the God of Light. With his memories starting to return and his powers growing with every battle, Chaos struggles to unravel his past and find his true destiny. Chaos appears to be a newer name than his original in this lifetime. In a flashback, he wears the name tag of &quot;Vermillion&quot;, from a dragon knight who found him in a bloody area with slain soldiers and a young girl in his arms. Despite his troubled past, he is a relatively good-natured young man who is somewhat clueless about romantic relationships, particularly with Iris Irine. He also is a very loyal friend, including to the very reticent Loki.
* Fenris Fenrir: The reincarnation of the Wolf God, Fenris has become a powerful warlock upon returning to life began searching the world for Balder, who had also been reborn as a mortal. Fenris wields many forgotten sorceries, as well as the magical demon-slaying staff Laevatein. Notably, she has the curious ability to copy any spell that strikes her. During her journey, she has come to care deeply for Chaos as well as her memory of Balder, and sees Iris Irine as both a friend and a rival for Chaos&#x27;s affections. She is a dignified and intelligent woman, seen as a big sister by Iris Irine and as an enigma by Chaos.
* Iris Irine: The heir to leadership of Fayon, village of warriors. Iris is a cleric in training and knows many healing spells. She uses Rune Cards (papers that are concealed with magic) inscribed with magical runes to debilitate the enemy and help her allies. Iris has been best friends with Chaos for years and cares about him a great deal (She even calls herself as Chaos&#x27; girlfriend sometimes). Though she considers herself dignified and ladylike, she&#x27;s prone to throwing tantrums and acting childish when she&#x27;s excited. She admires Fenris greatly and has a running rivalry with the thief Lidia. Currently, her greatest enemy is her half-sister the valkyrie Sara Irine. She wields the magic-destroying sword Chonryongdo, one of three legendary dragon blades. In the English version, there are multiple variations of the spelling of &quot;Chonryongdo&quot; (e.g., Chernryongdo) though none reflect the actual Korean spelling, Hepburn Romanisation suggesting instead Cheongryongdo.
* Loki: The most powerful member of the Assassins&#x27; Guild, Loki had never even been wounded twice in combat before encountering Chaos. When the Assassins Guild was almost totally destroyed by Skurai (who had framed the act on Chaos), Loki hunted Chaos down and attacked him. Chaos eventually managed to convince Loki that they were not enemies, and Loki has joined forces with Chaos to hunt down the true culprit. Loki is apparently totally devoid of emotions (though there is some debate on this topic) and has a hard time fathoming them in others. He wields &quot;The Might&quot; (&quot;Cosmic Energy&quot; in the English release), the most powerful form of magic in the world, and has been described as &quot;the one who is human and not&quot;.
* Lidia: A thief who travels with a two-tailed cat named Ses. Lidia fancies herself a treasure hunter like her father, and is searching the world over for magical artifacts. Her greatest wish is to find Alfheim, the hidden city of the elves, the one treasure (the treasure of Avariel in the original release) her father could never locate. Lidia started hanging out with Chaos and the gang in order to steal Iris&#x27;s dagger, Chonryongdo, and later latches on to Loki. She is known as Lidia in the English release.
* Reina (name not stated in the original release): An elfish archer that Chaos and his friends have run into during their time in the city of Geffen. She appears to be the last of her kind and wishes to protect the secret of Alfhiem, the ancient city of the elves. She doesn&#x27;t like Lidia as she is trying to steal the treasures of Alfhiem but she puts aside her differences with her and Loki during their adventure in Alfhiem while battling a powerful assassin (Juliana Lucille) and wizard (The city Mayor). Since the manhwa has been halted it is unclear what will become of her after her, Lidia, and Loki&#x27;s adventure.

===Other characters===
* The Beholders: Huginn and Muninn, two mysterious individuals who are able to transform into crows. They are the eyes of Odin, Allfather of the Gods, and are acting to influence events in Midgard. They are the ones who directed Skurai to attack first the village of Fayon, and then the Assassins Guild. They also acted to save both Skurai and Sara Irine from the dragon Nidhogg that Chaos summoned during the battle (by accident due to his flashbacks). Their true motives are a mystery, but Muninn seems to have a more sadistic side than the silent Huginn, who displays occasional compassion, such as when he kills a monster about to devour a child.
* The Asgard Rangers: A wild band of strangely dressed women who consider themselves to be the champions of truth and justice, but they seem to simply attack targets at random, then declare their victims to be &#x27;unrighteous&#x27;, justifying their own extreme actions. Their wild poses and wacky antics serve to hide their considerable fighting skills. They seem to be a parody of sentai groups like Sailor Moon and Power Rangers.
* Doyen and Peony Irine: The father and mother of Iris. They both die at the hands of Skurai and Sara Irine. Lady Irine seems to be the brains behind the operation but the Lord is not dumb, just easily blinded by love of his daughter. Lord Irine is also father to Sara, by another mother, who he later kills for unrevealed reasons. Lord Irine&#x27;s dying request is for Iris not to hate her sister. Lady Irine is implied to have been killed by Skurai in an attempt to protect the children (Nuri and Seri).
* Matthew and the Guards: The accomplished guards of Fayon are led by the massive, if not lovable, Matthew. His hair resembles a rooster&#x27;s crest, leading Chaos to call him &#x27;chicken head&#x27;. He has a blatant infatuation with Iris but never lets it get in the way of duty. The main weapon of the guards is a wall of lethal cannons. These valiant souls go down defending their home. Matthew is made into a zombie by Himmelmez in order to make a foe Chaos would not willingly fight.
* Ses (Sessy) the Cat o&#x27; Two Tails: This cat can talk, though Lidia would prefer it could not. He (&#x27;she&#x27; in the English release) seems to be more reasonable and rational then her owner. According to the Official Player&#x27;s Handbook found at the start of each volume after the first, she provides a 50% bonus on Pickpocketing Saves. While this is relatively illogical both in wording and use, Ses does seem to do all the work in most of Lidia&#x27;s criminal escapades.
* The Assassins Guild: This group of Arabic inspired warriors are dedicated to preserving the balance of power within the entire continent and this means favoring good or evil as the balance shifts. The policy does not exactly make them friends with anyone. Most are slaughtered by Skurai. Taulin and a small band of others survive because they accompany Loki to battle Surt&#x27;s minions. The survivors are eventually stationed at the Guild headquarters to rebuild and recover the heavy losses taken.
* General Karl Johann Spiegal: Commander of the forces of Volsug, he is a competent and good natured man. He is forced to imprison Chaos and his companions but assures them that he trusts them and would support them as a witness. When the forces of Himmelmez attack the city, he takes Fenris and Iris to the fragment of the Heart of Ymir. He becomes critically wounded but is stabilized in time.
* The White and Black Mages: These taciturn characters constantly show up in the background of any major crowd. They are mimics of their namesakes from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; RPG series. They appear to be a tribute to that popular series.
* Angelina Kidman: This spunky young woman is the announcer for the Geffen magic tourney and the prime secretary (as said in the original release) of the Witch Guild. She has a lecherous co-host, Frontain Rod, who is more concerned with the breasts of female competitors.
* Frontain Rod Kimacue: He is the co-host announcer of the Geffen magic tourney, by Angelina&#x27;s side, and the account manager of the Gravity Research Union (as said in the original release). He is a rather perverted person, who keeps peeking on women&#x27;s breasts with his binoculars. Although he seems to be only an old perverted man, he has a lot of knowledge about magic and fighting techniques. He recognizes every single move that Fenris uses and is being curious about who Fenris really is.
* Gustav Kube the Magician: A novice magician who explains the city of Geffen to heroes. His character model would later be used as the basis for Mage in &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;.

==Additional information==
This series is supposed to go on for 40+ books, but Lee Myoung-Jin has put it aside to work on artwork for &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; instead.

<doc id="1198416" wikidata="Q457292" url="?curid=1198416" title="Jimmy Pursey">
<text>James Timothy Pursey (born 9 February 1955) is an English rock musician. He is the founder and frontman of the punk rock band Sham 69, which he has performed with since 1976, along with releasing material as a solo artist.

==Early life==
Pursey was born in Hersham, in the county of Surrey on 9 February 1955. His father was a plumber and former British Army soldier, and his mother worked as a cinema usherette. He received his education at Hersham House &amp; Burhill Infants, Hersham Juniors, and at Rydens School, which he left at the age of 15 to work in a curtain shop.
In his youth he was a regular attender at the local disco, the Walton Hop at the Playhouse Theatre, where he met the record producer Jonathan King. He began performing in public after taking the stage as a drunk fourteen-year-old at the disco, miming to Bay City Rollers and Rolling Stones songs.

==Career==
In 1976 while working at Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium with Albie Slider, Billy Bostik and Neil Harris, having been inspired by the music of The Ramones, Pursey formed a punk rock band called &#x27;Jimmy and the Ferrets&#x27;, which went on to become &#x27;Sham 69&#x27;. The band initially rehearsed at Slider&#x27;s parents&#x27; pig farm, where Jonathan King sometimes came to watch them, considering the option of becoming the act&#x27;s promoter. Before securing a record contract the lineup changed, with Harris and Bostock being replaced by Dave Parsons and Mark Cain. Slider left shortly afterwards and was replaced by Dave Tregunna on the bass guitar.

Sham 69 went on to release four long-players via Polydor Records, and had six UK top 50 singles before it broke up in 1980, with the violence that regularly marred its gigs having taken a toll on the band.

Pursey set up a short-lived new band with Steve Jones and Paul Cook, formerly of The Sex Pistols, titled the &quot;Sham Pistols&quot;, before embarking on a solo career. He also worked around this period as a record producer on the early releases by Cockney Rejects, and the Angelic Upstarts.

His first solo material was released via Polydor Records, being the single &quot;Lucky Man&quot; (1980), and a long-player entitled &quot;Imagination Camouflage&quot; (1980), recorded with Derwood Andrews and Mark Laff, formerly of Generation X as session musicians, who also received co-writing credits for two of the LP&#x27;s songs. Pursey then moved to Epic Records for three further singles releases, including &quot;Animals Have More Fun&quot; (1981), co-written with Peter Gabriel, and a second solo LP entitled &quot;Alien Orphan&quot; (1981). In 1983, a third long-player, entitled &quot;Revenge is not the Password&quot;, was released on the Code Black label. He later released a fourth solo album entitled &quot;Code Black&quot; (1997).

In 1986 Pursey reformed Sham 69 with Dave Parsons, and a new line-up. The band continued to play live and record until 2006. In 2006, Pursey recorded a new version of the Sham 69 hit &quot;Hurry Up Harry&quot; as an unofficial World Cup song in aid of a cancer charity; &quot;Hurry Up England&quot; was recorded with Graham Coxon&#x27;s band but credited to &#x27;Sham 69 &amp; the Special Assembly&#x27;. In January 2007 the band broke up. &quot;NME&quot; reported that a statement released by Parsons included the message: &quot;Sham 69 have left Jimmy Pursey on the eve of their 30th anniversary.&quot; Pursey initially stated that he would be retaining the Sham 69 name, but in January 2008, he announced that: &quot;to avoid confusion to fans he wanted it known that he did not want to be associated with the band still performing as Sham 69&quot;. In 2008 he set up a new band titled Day 21 with Mat Sargent on bass, The Rev (Towers of London and The Prodigy) on guitar, and Snell (Towers of London). In July 2011 Pursey reformed Sham 69 again with the band&#x27;s late 1970s members. At a meeting held between Pursey and Dave Parsons, original Sham 69 guitarist and co-writer of nearly all of the Sham repertoire with Pursey, the two ironed out their differences. Dave Tregunna, on bass, and Mark Cain, on drums, were called in to complete the original lineup for a show in London.

==Personal life==
Pursey lives in the Surrey town of Chertsey. He is a part-time artist, and has been known to sell paintings to raise funding for the Hersham Hounds Greyhound Sanctuary. 

In 2002, Pursey received a police caution for indecent assault, after admitting to forcibly kissing a teenage girl in Weybridge, Surrey.

In May 2005 there was a disturbance at The Head art gallery in Brighton, when Pursey interrupted an art show opening drinks party and removed a number of his paintings from the display after a disagreement with the curator over them.

<doc id="1198428" wikidata="Q2892262" url="?curid=1198428" title="Congressional Cemetery">
<text>The Congressional Cemetery, officially Washington Parish Burial Ground, is a historic and active cemetery located at 1801 E Street, S.E., in Washington, D.C., on the west bank of the Anacostia River. It is the only American &quot;cemetery of national memory&quot; founded before the Civil War. Over 65,000 individuals are buried or memorialized at the cemetery, including many who helped form the nation and Washington, D.C., in the early 19th century.

Christ Church, an Episcopal church, owns the cemetery. The U.S. government has purchased 806 burial plots, which are administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Located about a mile and a half (2.4 km) to the southeast of the U.S. Capitol Building, the cemetery is historically associated with the U.S. Congress. The cemetery still sells plots, and is an active burial ground. It is three blocks east of the Potomac Avenue Metro station and two blocks south of the Stadium-Armory Metro station.

Many members of Congress who died while Congress was in session are interred at Congressional Cemetery. Other burials include early landowners and speculators, the builders and architects of early Washington, D.C., Native American diplomats, Washington, D.C. mayors, American Civil War veterans, and 19th century Washington, D.C., families unaffiliated with the federal government.

The cemetery is the resting place of one vice president, one Supreme Court justice, six Cabinet members, nineteen senators, 71 U.S. Representatives, including a former speaker of the House, veterans from every American war, and J. Edgar Hoover, the first FBI director.

The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1969, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2011.

==History==
===19th century===
Congressional Cemetery was established by private citizens associated with Christ Church on a 4.5-acre plot in 1807, who later gave the property to the church, which gave it its official name &quot;Washington Parish Burial Ground&quot;. By 1817 sites were set aside for government legislators and officials; this includes cenotaphs for many legislators buried elsewhere. The cenotaphs, designed by Benjamin Latrobe, each have a large square block with recessed panels set on a wider plinth and surmounted by a conical point.

From 1823 to 1876, the U.S. Congress funded the expansion, enhancement, and maintenance of the cemetery, but it never became a federal institution. Appropriations funded a gravel road from the Capitol to the cemetery, paving within the cemetery, the public vault, fencing, and the gatehouse, and funerals for congressmen and the cenotaphs. During the early part of this period, graves were laid out in a grid pattern in an extension of the grid in the L&#x27;Enfant Plan for Washington, and little or no landscaping or plantings were made on the grounds. The grid survives to this day and was extended as the cemetery expanded.

Starting in the late 1840s, the cemetery was influenced by the rural cemetery movement in which the graves were placed in a park-like setting with extensive landscaping. To implement this new vision, the cemetery needed to expand.

Between 1849 and 1869, the cemetery grew in area to 35.75 acres. The original cemetery was located on block 1115 on E Street between 18th and 19th Streets Southeast in 1808. In 1849, it doubled in size by acquiring the block to its south, 1116. In 1853, it expanded to the east on blocks 1130, 1148 and 1149 between F and G Streets Southeast. In 1853–53, the cemetery expanded to the west by acquiring block 1104, between 17th Street and 18th Streets Southeast. In 1858, the cemetery acquired block 1105 and Reservation 13. In 1859, it added blocks 1105 and 1123. Finally, the cemetery reached its current extent of 35.75 acres by growing south to Water Street Southeast with blocks 1106 and 1117 in 1869.

====Arsenal Disaster Monument====
In 1864, an explosion at the nearby Washington Arsenal killed a woman supervisor and 20 teenage girls, most of them Irish, who worked packing explosives and cartridges. President Lincoln led the funeral procession to the cemetery and attended the graveside ceremonies. Later a monument was erected over the graves of 16 of the victims. A sculpture of a grieving young woman stands atop a marble column on the monument. Local artist Lot Flannery, of the Flannery Brothers Marble Manufacturers, sculpted the monument.

Eventually the land to the south of the cemetery was transferred to the National Park Service, although the access road to the RFK Stadium parking lot is administered by the DC Sports and Entertainment Commission. In the 1950s, it appeared that the southeast corner of the cemetery would become a part of the right of way for the Southeast-Southwest Freeway. However, protracted environmental litigation halted construction at Pennsylvania Avenue, with the dead end of the freeway being connected by a temporary road to the RFK parking lot and to 17th Street Southeast at the southwest corner of the cemetery.

After 1876, the cemetery was seldom used or supported by Congress. Nevertheless, many wealthy Washingtonians continued to bury family members there, and figures associated with the government who were local residents, including Marine Corps Band director John Philip Sousa and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, are buried there.

===20th century===

By the 1970s, urban decay, the declining membership of Christ Church, and the declining value of the endowment funded by Christ Church, left the cemetery in serious difficulties. Monuments and burial vaults were in disrepair. Maintenance on buildings had been long delayed. There was no paid staff and minimal funding. Drug dealers and prostitutes began to occupy the cemetery.

===21st century===
The cemetery is still owned by Christ Church but since 1976 it has been managed by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC). Progress on the renovation was very slow until two volunteers became involved. Jim Oliver, then assistant manager of the House Republican Cloakroom, became involved in the late 1980s and helped revive congressional interest in the cemetery. The K-9 Corps, a group of dog owners whose activities helped drive away the drug dealers, was organized in 1997.

Renovation picked up after C-SPAN broadcast a video on the cemetery on July 5, 1996. The following weekend 100 airmen from Andrews Air Force Base arrived unannounced to mow the 35-acre lawn, and a contingent from the Army post at Fort Belvoir followed the next month. A Joint Service Day involving all five branches of the U.S. military has since become an annual tradition. In 2013, a record 328 people participated.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation included the cemetery on its 1997 list of America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places and many gifts and donations were soon received. Congress gave $1 million in matching funds in 1999 to create an endowment for basic maintenance, and a 2002 Congressional appropriation funds restoration.

The APHCC now hosts over 1,000 volunteers each year working on a wide variety of projects, including planting bulbs, resetting tombstones, pruning trees, adopting and landscaping individual plots, providing research, and writing a quarterly newsletter. Events hosted by the APHCC have included free guided tours on Saturdays, Christmas caroling, Christ Church&#x27;s Easter services, book signings, Pride 5k race and Dead Man&#x27;s Run 5k race, Day of the Dog Festival, and Ghosts &amp; Goblets Gala.

In May 2013, Congressional Cemetery hired Topographix, a firm which surveys cemeteries using ground-penetrating radar, to document burials in the cemetery. Although the cemetery had excellent records going back to its founding, many burial sites lacked a marker or had the marker removed or stolen. Additionally, subsidence of some areas and buckling in others has changed the location of some graves. The last time Congressional Cemetery was accurately and completely mapped was 1935.

By the end of 2013, about half the cemetery had been mapped, revealing a potential 2,750 unmarked burial sites. Cemetery staff said many of these burials are probably recorded, but some may be new discoveries. Congressional Cemetery officials said they were one of only 12 cemeteries in the city still accepting burials, and the mapping project would allow it to identify unused space. The mapping project was to be completed in the spring of 2014, and the cemetery said it would use the results to release a mobile phone app which will allow users to search for and locate graves on their own.

In August 2013, the cemetery began using goats to eat and clear the surrounding wooded area of poison ivy, English ivy, grass, and other plants. The 58 &quot;eco-goats&quot;, which cost $4,000, are considered more ecologically friendly than mowers and pesticides and provide fertilizer as well. It was the first use of goats inside the beltway. The use of the goats drew widespread international attention and televised reports on BBC World News, Nat Geo, News Hour, NBC Nightly News, Tokyo TV, China CCTV, and Al-Jazeera.

==Monuments and structures==

The Congressional Cemetery is a National Historic Landmark Historic District with nine contributing structures and 186 contributing objects built from 1817 to 1876. Later structures and objects are considered to be &quot;non-contributing&quot; even if they are significant in the cemetery&#x27;s current appearance.

===Cenotaphs===

Of the 186 contributing objects, 168 are the nearly identical Congressional cenotaphs, believed to have been designed by the Architect of the Capitol Benjamin Latrobe. As used at the Congressional Cemetery, the term &quot;cenotaph&quot; includes not only monuments to those buried elsewhere, but also the Latrobe monuments that mark occupied graves of representatives and senators. Some congressmen are buried under a cenotaph, some are buried without one in a different area of the cemetery, and for some the marker is a true cenotaph. James Gillespie (1747–1805), who was reinterred in 1892, has a separate grave and cenotaph.

A cenotaph was erected for each congressman who died in office from 1833 to 1876. The first was for former U.S. Representative James Lent. After Congress appropriated funds and his monument was ordered, his family reinterred the body in New York. Congress erected the monument in 1839 anyway, establishing the tradition of erecting cenotaphs.

The cenotaphs are constructed of Aquia sandstone, as are the White House and the Capitol, and were likewise painted white, forming a visual connections with these nearby symbols of federal government, and a contrast to the surrounding gravestones. They are grouped in rows in the older part of the cemetery where they dominate the landscape.

After the Civil War very few congressmen were buried in the cemetery, as their bodies were commonly shipped to their home states or buried in the new National Cemeteries such as Arlington National Cemetery. Cenotaphs were discontinued in 1876 after Massachusetts Senator George Frisbie Hoar stated that &quot;the thought of being buried beneath one of those atrocities brought new terror to death.&quot;

William Thornton, who served as Architect of the Capitol before Latrobe, is the only person honored with a cenotaph who did not serve as a congressman. Former Speaker of the House Tip O&#x27;Neill was honored with a cenotaph in 1994, though it is not in the style of a Latrobe cenotaph. After a 1972 plane crash in which their bodies were lost, Hale Boggs and Nicholas Begich share a cenotaph. These are the only cenotaphs erected since 1876.

===Public Vault===
The Public Vault is an early classical revival structure built from 1832 to 1834 with federal funds to store the bodies of government officials prior to burial.

A classical marble facade with baroque scrolls decorates the partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words &quot;PUBLIC VAULT&quot; displayed by means of vent holes. Temporary residents of this vault have included three U.S. presidents: John Quincy Adams (1848), William Henry Harrison (1841), and Zachary Taylor (1850). President Harrison stayed in the vault for three months, three times longer than the time he served as president.

First Lady Dolley Madison was interred in the Public Vault for two years, the longest known interment in the vault, while funds were being raised for her reinterment at Montpelier. Her body was transferred to the Causten family vault, located directly across the path from the Public Vault, for another six years before the funds were raised. First Lady Louisa Catherine Adams has been reported as having been interred in the Public Vault, but other sources report that she was interred in the Causten family vault. Adams is now buried next to her husband in the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts.

Lewis Powell is believed to have spent a night in the vault while avoiding pursuit for his role in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.

==Grand funerals==
Several nationally important or otherwise remarkable funerals have taken place at the Congressional Cemetery. These funerals featured long formal processions starting at the White House or the Capitol, moving down Pennsylvania Avenue to E Street SE, and then to the cemetery. Parts of this road were specially funded by Congress to facilitate these processions. The form and protocol of these funerals formed the basis for later U.S. state funerals, including those of Presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.

These funerals include those held to honor:
* George Clinton, vice president, funeral held April 22, 1812. The procession included President James Madison as well as the officers and members of both houses of Congress.
* Jacob Jennings Brown, Commanding General of the United States Army and War of 1812 hero, funeral held February 24, 1828.
* William Henry Harrison, president, 1841. After services at the White House the procession included the new president John Tyler and former president John Quincy Adams, as well as officers and members of the Congress and the state legislature of Maryland, extending over two miles long.
* Abel P. Upshur, Secretary of State, Thomas Walker Gilmer, Secretary of the Navy, Commodore Beverly Kennon, Chief of the Bureau of Construction &amp; Equipment, David Gardiner, former state senator from New York, victims of a February 28, 1844, explosion on the . Virgil Maxcy, &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; of the U.S. to Belgium was also killed in the explosion, but he was buried separately in his family plot.
* John Quincy Adams, former president, former senator, and representative, who died in the Capitol, funeral held February 28, 1848. Adams is buried in the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts.
* Dolley Madison, former First Lady, funeral held July 16, 1849. President Zachary Taylor and his Cabinet attended services at St. John&#x27;s Church in Lafayette Square, whence the cortege proceeded to the Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery.
* Zachary Taylor, president, funeral held July 13, 1850. Proceeding from the White House, the cortege included the new president Millard Fillmore, the Cabinet, the officers and members of both houses of Congress, numerous military units, and Taylor&#x27;s favorite horse, Old Whitey.

==Association and active cemetery==
The cemetery is administered by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC), which is a non-profit corporation headed by a 15-member board of directors. The association has nine full-time employees, one part-time archivist, and over 500 volunteers. Its mission is:
Historic Congressional Cemetery preserves, promotes, and protects our historic and active burial ground. We respectfully celebrate the legacy of those interred here through education, historic preservation, community engagement, and environmental stewardship.

In 2009, the association retained Oehme, van Sweden &amp; Associates to develop a new landscape plan. The cemetery has approximately 2,000 plots available for sale. On March 20, 2014, the cemetery received its green burial certification from the Green Burial Council. Green burials are allowed in any plot in the cemetery.

===K-9 Corps===
Congressional Cemetery is also known for allowing members of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC) to walk dogs off-leash on the cemetery grounds. In addition to their membership dues, K-9 Corps members pay a fee for the privilege of walking their dogs. K-9 Corps members provide about 20% of Congressional Cemetery&#x27;s operating income. Dog walkers follow a set of rules and regulations and provide valuable volunteer time to restore the cemetery.

The K-9 Corps program is recognized as providing the impetus for the revitalization of Congressional Cemetery, which had fallen into neglect prior to the program&#x27;s creation. In 2008, the association restricted K-9 membership, placing restrictions on dogwalkers as the program became more popular. The K-9 Corps program has been nationally recognized for creative use of urban green space.

<text>Tredegar Square pronounced is a well-preserved Georgian square in Mile End, within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The square has a garden in the centre with lawns and large trees.

==Location==

Tredegar Square is 90 metres north of the main commercial thoroughfare of the district, Mile End Road. Six roads branch off the square including one sharing its name, Tredegar Square; the eponymous roadway forms an intersection with Mile End Road, about 120 metres east of Mile End tube station.

==Architecture==
In pale brown brick, three nearly identical unbroken terraces line the west, south and east sides of the square, with long continuous white cornices, sash windows, fanlights, railings in front of basements and bold, traditional single-colour doors. All windows are white framed and a stucco white frame fronts the four central houses of each of these three rows, with a white gable façade feature centered above the middle two houses (see image). The north terrace is a different design, with its own similar shaped houses or sets of subdivided houses; these have white, ashlar-faced fronts or genuine large carved stone block facings, black railings on white-painted concrete and heavily porticoed, projecting and recessed features — for example, pediments above a feature window in the few recesses. The level of complex forms and white stone-like appearance of the north terrace resembles many of the blocks in Belgravia and Bayswater.

==History==

The south and west sides of the square were completed in the 1830s, and the rest by 1847.

The square takes its name from the landowner, Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet Tredegar, and his family estate Tredegar House near Newport, South Wales. One block north of the square is the &quot;Lord Tredegar&quot; pub and one block east &quot;The Morgan Arms&quot;, on Morgan Street.

The industrial town of Tredegar in South Wales was also named after the Tredegar estate, following the establishment nearby of The Tredegar Iron Company in 1800, on land owned by the Morgan family.

===Coborn School campus named after square===

Prisca Coborn (1622–1701), the widow of a Bow brewer, left property in Bow, Stratford, and Bocking (Essex) to maintain a school for not more than 50 poor children at Bow; the boys were to learn reading, writing, and accounts, and the girls reading, writing, and needlework. An expansion plan in 1873, to day-school 200 boys and 200 girls (in adjoining buildings) meant the Bocking estate was sold and part of the proceeds used to purchase and extend a building &quot;in Tredegar Square&quot;, however clearly shown on the map as narrowly beyond its north-west corner, also known as Stepney Grammar School. The school did not prosper on its own in its new surroundings, and by 1884 was in financial difficulties; the girls&#x27; school temporarily closed and a merger took place within a decade. In 1898 Coborn School was moved to 29–31 Bow Road, where it remained until the move to Upminster in 1971, initial plans of which had been well advanced in 1963.

===Restoration after damage in the London Blitz===
The Tredegar Square Conservation Area was established in 1971. The square had become neglected prior to World War II, made worse when the area surrounding the square was badly damaged by bombing during the war.

<doc id="1198453" wikidata="Q897959" url="?curid=1198453" title="10 000 Hz Legend">
<text>10 000 Hz Legend is the second studio album by French electronic music duo Air, released in France on 28 May 2001 by Virgin Records and in the United States on 29 May 2001 by Astralwerks. On this album, tracks are longer and more electronic-oriented than on their previous records. These experimentations find the duo expanding their capacities and working with other artists including Beck and suGar Yoshinaga of Buffalo Daughter.

The album artwork was produced by Ito Morabito. It features Monument Valley, located on the Arizona–Utah border.

==Critical reception==

&quot;10 000 Hz Legend&quot; received generally less favourable reviews from critics than had their previous albums; however, &quot;Q&quot; listed &quot;10 000 Hz Legend&quot; as one of the 50 best albums of 2001. Most reviewers focused on the group&#x27;s departure from the sound of 1998&#x27;s &quot;Moon Safari&quot;, although the soundtrack album &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (2000) had a similar mood and sound.

The American music website &quot;Stereogum&quot; takes its name from the lyrics of the song &quot;Radio #1&quot;.

<text>Sanjaya (Sanskrit: सञ्जय, meaning &quot;victory&quot;) or Sanjaya Gavalgana is a figure from the ancient Indian Hindu epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Sanjaya is the advisor of the blind king Dhritarashtra, the ruler of the Kuru kingdom and the father of the Kauravas, as well as serving as his charioteer. Sanjaya is a disciple of Sage Vyasa. He is stated to have the gift of &quot;divya drishti&quot; (divine vision), the ability to observe distant events within his mind, granted by Vyasa. He narrates to Dhritarashtra the events of the Kurukshetra War, including the ones described in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

==Role in the Mahabharata==
===As a messenger===
Before this great war broke out, Sanjaya had gone to Yudhishtira as the Ambassador of Kauravas to negotiate on behalf of them.

===Gift of Divine Vision ===
Having a divine vision is completely different than just a subtle sight (&quot;Sanjaya&#x27;s Gift&quot;). One who possesses a subtle sight sees image of things invisible in his mind, whereas in divine vision, instead of it being in the mind, it is like seeing it in person. Also, the sounds are heard with the physical ear and not as a current of thought.

===As the describer of the Mahabharata war===

While Sanjaya was still in Hastinapur, the series of events that happened on the battlefield of Kurukshetra was very clear to him (&quot;Sanjaya&#x27;s Gift&quot;). He saw with his eyes as if he was on the battlefield. Sanjaya saw:
partisans of Dhritarashtra and the Pandavas gathered there, heard with his ears the words of Duryodhana, the fierce battle-cry of grandfather Bhishma, the mighty sound of Panchajanya proclaiming the destruction of the Kurus, and the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna bringing out the import of the Gita (&quot;Sanjaya&#x27;s Gift&quot;).

Sanjaya clearly has an advantage over an average person because he could hear things that would even frighten the average person. He was described to be gifted as he could see &quot;events at a distance granted by the Rishi Vyasa&quot; (&quot;Sanjaya, Charioteer&quot;). On the eve of the Mahabharata War, the Gita was spoken, &quot;we find in the very first verse of the Gita, King Dhritarashtra seeking information about the War from Sanjaya who had received the gift of divine vision&quot; (&quot;Sanjaya&#x27;s Gift&quot;).

As Dhritarashtra&#x27;s advisor, Sanjaya&#x27;s job was not as hard. Until he had to tell Dhritarashtra the news of the death of his &quot;hundred sons at the hands of Bhima at different points of time in the battle and offers the sorrowing king solace in his darkest hours&quot; (&quot;Vyasa&quot;). Sanjaya tells every incident of the Kurukshetra war. Sanjaya also gives various descriptions of:
Earth, the other planets, and focuses on the Indian subcontinent and gives an elaborate list of hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, provinces, cities, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, and forests of the (ancient) Indian Subcontinent (Bharata Varsha).

He also explains about the military formations adopted by each side on each day, the death of each hero and the details of each war-racing (&quot;Vyasa&quot;).
Sanjaya is known to be very frank in his narration of the battle events and his opinions and he also predicted the destruction of Kauravas at the hands of Krishna and Arjuna (&quot;Sanjaya, Charioteer&quot;). Sanjaya was Dhritarashtra&#x27;s honest advisor.

== Symbolism ==
Sanjaya is a virtuous character who &quot;represents intuitive knowledge, which arises from long and arduous spiritual practice, a predominance of sattva and inner awakening&quot; (V, &quot;Symbolism in the Bhagavadgita&quot;). Despite him not being as lucky as Arjuna to earn the divine grace, he is still able to receive knowledge from Lord Krishna because he mastered having control over his body and mind (V, &quot;Symbolism in the Bhagavadgita&quot;). He represents having a sense of awareness as he is able to witness all of the details occurring in the battle. Sanjaya was able to spot when &quot;Arjuna dropped his bow and arrows, and sat down on the seat of the chariot, with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow&quot; (Sharma 11). Seeing Arjuna past his physical appearance as being exhausted from the battle, Sanjaya displays his mastery in the mind and body as he was able to see Arjuna as sorrowful.

<text>The Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK; ), translated as the Chinese Proficiency Test, is the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s standardized test of proficiency in the Standard Chinese language for non-native speakers. The test is administered by the National Chinese Proficiency Test Committee, an agency of the Ministry of Education of China.

The test cannot be taken in Taiwan, where only Taiwan&#x27;s TOCFL exam can be taken. In turn, the TOCFL exam is not available in Mainland China.

== Background ==
Development of the HSK test began in 1984 at Beijing Language and Culture University, and was officially made a national standardized test in 1992. By 2005, over 120 countries had participated as regular host sites and the tests had been taken around 100 million times (domestic ethnic minority candidates included). In 2011, Beijing International Chinese College became the first HSK testing center to conduct the HSK test online.

The HSK test is analogous to the English TOEFL, and an HSK certificate is valid without any limitation in China. The test aims to be a certificate of language proficiency for higher educational and professional purposes. It is not uncommon to refer to a standard or level of proficiency by the HSK level number, or score. For example, a job description might ask for foreign applicants with &quot;HSK5 or better.&quot;

The HSK is administered solely in Mandarin and in simplified Chinese characters; however, if the exam is paper-based, the test-taker can choose to write the writing assignments in simplified or in traditional characters, at their discretion. The test can be either paper-based or Internet-based, depending on what the specific test center offers. With an Internet-based test, the writing part with characters (from HSK 3 on) is subjectively and slightly easier, as one types the pinyin and selects the right character from the list, while with a paper-based test, one must remember the characters, their strokes and their order, and write them out.

Test takers with outstanding results can win a scholarship for short-term language study in China.

== Structure ==
=== From 2021 ===

In 2020, an internal Chinese academic paper discussed that the Chinese Proficiency Standards would undergo a change: a hybrid paradigm of &quot;Three Stages and Nine Levels&quot; characterized by all-in-one integration. The Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China announced further details regarding HSK 3.0 on April 1, 2021. Among the information shared was a wordlist for each individual stage, and a date for the introduction of the new test—July 1, 2021. As of April 2022 no HSK 3.0 tests have been rolled out and only a single preparation book for the basic levels has been published, additionally the HSK 2.0 test format is still in use. An update on the official HSK website suggests, that the April 2021 date only signified the start date for the conception of the new HSK 3.0. New practice materials for the intermediate and advanced levels are expected to be released in the third or fourth quarter of 2022. One of the main problems with the current HSK test is that it does not follow the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). For example, HSK 6 was nowhere close to Near Native C2 in English, and so on.

The new test is meant to follow the latest research in the field of language studies and testing. The basic levels (roughly corresponding to CEFR A1/A2) should test from 500 to 2245 words, the intermediate levels (roughly corresponding to CEFR B1/B2) from 3245 to 5456 words, the advanced levels (roughly corresponding to CEFR C1/C2) from about 6000 to 11000 words. Chinese Proficiency Grading Standards for International Chinese Language Education has provided a breakdown of the skills required for each level.

The intermediate levels should test the ability to understand slightly modified authentic materials or authentic materials written/spoken in a clear manner and intended for educated mother tongue speakers: materials concerning everyday topics, simple articles, simple commentaries and critiques found in newspapers and magazines.

The advanced levels should test the ability to understand longer, more complicated and abstract materials: extracts from authentic sources such as textbooks for Chinese university students, Chinese magazine and essays, extracts from modern Chinese literature, interviews and extracts from Chinese media. Moreover, Classical Chinese expressions and grammatical structures used in modern formal Chinese should be included too.

HSK 3.0 now also includes a focus on handwritten Chinese characters and translation, which was not included in HSK 2.0. Also there is a redistribution of words in each level. For instance, some words were previously grouped under Level 3, but is now under Level 1 in HSK 3.0.

=== Between 2010–2021 ===
The previous format was introduced in 2010, with a philosophy of testing &quot;comprehensive language and communication ability&quot;. Most notable are the inclusion of written segments at all levels (not just in the Advanced levels as in the pre-2010 test), a reform of the ranking system, and the use of new question structures. Complete vocabulary lists, previous tests, and simulated tests are available as preparation materials. A minor update of the vocabulary lists was made in 2012.

The HSK consists of a written test and an oral test, which are taken separately. This oral test is also known as the HSKK or .

==== Written test ====
The Listening, Reading and Writing tests each have a maximum score of 100. HSK 1 and 2 therefore have a maximum score of 200 with 120 points required to pass. HSK 3 and 4 have a maximum of 300 points with 180 points required to pass. There is no minimum number of points required for each of the sections as long as the sum is over 120 or 180 points respectively.

HSK 5 and 6 also have a maximum of 300 points and originally required a score of 180 points to pass. However, since a decision made in February 2013, there has been no official passing score for either HSK 5 or 6.

Hanban provides examples of the exam for the different levels together with a list of words that need to be known for each level. These examples are also available (together with the audio for the Listening Test) on the websites of the Confucius Institute at QUT and HSK Academy.

==== Online test ====
The written version is now available in two forms, a computer and a paper based test. Both tests are still held at test centers, the differences between the two are as follows:
* Not every test center has the facilities for conducting computer-based tests
* Computer-based tests allow you to input characters using the keyboard
* Results of computer-based tests are published two weeks after the exam, paper-based test results take one month

==== Oral test ====
The HSKK test is a separate test. However, the three HSKK levels correspond with the six HSK levels of the written test.
==== Comparison with CEFR levels ====
In 2010, Hanban asserted that the HSK&#x27;s six levels corresponded to the six levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). However, the German and French associations of Chinese language teachers reject this equivalency, arguing that HSK Level 6 is only equivalent to CEFR Level B2 or C1.

=== Before 2010 ===
==== Ranking ====

Formerly, there were 11 possible ranks (1-11) and 3 test formats (Basic, Elementary/Intermediate, and Advanced). A rank of between 3 and 8 was needed to enroll in a Chinese university, depending on the subject being studied. A score of 9 or higher was a common business standard.

A student taking the Basic test (HSK) could attain a rank of 1 through 3 (1-3), or fail to meet requirements and thus not receive a rank. The Elementary/Intermediate test (HSK) covered ranks 3-8 (3-8), with ranks below 3 not considered. Likewise, the Advanced test (HSK) covered ranks 9-11 (9-11), with scores below 9 not considered.

==== Content ====
The previous format for both Basic and Elementary/Intermediate HSK included four sections: listening comprehension, grammar structures, reading comprehension, and written expressions. Aside from the written expressions portion (which requires writing of Chinese characters), these two tests were completely multiple-choice. The Advanced HSK however, added an additional two portions: spoken and written.

== Test dates and locations ==
The HSK is held at designated test centers in China and abroad. A list of test centers can be found at the HSK website. Test dates are published annually and written tests are more frequently held than spoken ones, generally around once a month, depending on the test center. Test registration is usually open until 30 days prior to the actual test date for the paper-based test or around 10 days prior the actual test date for the computer-based test. Results are generally available around 30 days after completion (but no definite date is given for results).

The test cannot be taken in Taiwan (The Republic of China). In Taiwan, only the TOCFL exam can be taken. Conversely, the TOCFL can not be taken in Mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong.

<doc id="1198458" wikidata="Q1137696" url="?curid=1198458" title="Boiling chip">
<text>A boiling chip, boiling stone, or porous bit anti-bumping granule is a tiny, unevenly shaped piece of substance added to liquids to make them boil more calmly. Boiling chips are frequently employed in distillation and heating. When a liquid becomes superheated, a speck of dust or a stirring rod can cause violent flash boiling. Boiling chips provide nucleation sites so the liquid boils smoothly without becoming superheated or bumping.

== Use ==
Boiling chips should not be added to liquid that is already near its boiling point, as this could also induce flash boiling. Boiling chips should not be used when cooking unless they are suitable for food-grade applications. 

The structure of a boiling chip traps liquid while in use, meaning that they cannot be re-used in laboratory setups. They also don&#x27;t work well under vacuum; if a solution is boiling under vacuum, it is best to constantly stir it instead.

== Materials ==

Boiling chips are typically made of a porous material, such as alumina, silicon carbide, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, porcelain or carbon, and often have a nonreactive coating of PTFE. This ensures that the boiling chips will provide effective nucleation sites, yet are chemically inert. In less demanding situations, like school laboratories, pieces of broken porcelainware or glassware are often used.

<doc id="1198459" wikidata="Q3753940" url="?curid=1198459" title="Tunable laser">
<text>A tunable laser is a laser whose wavelength of operation can be altered in a controlled manner. While all laser gain media allow small shifts in output wavelength, only a few types of lasers allow continuous tuning over a significant wavelength range.

There are many types and categories of tunable lasers. They exist in the gas, liquid, and solid states. Among the types of tunable lasers are excimer lasers, gas lasers (such as CO2 and He-Ne lasers), dye lasers (liquid and solid state), transition-metal solid-state lasers, semiconductor crystal and diode lasers, and free-electron lasers. Tunable lasers find applications in spectroscopy, photochemistry, atomic vapor laser isotope separation, and optical communications.

==Types of tunability==

===Single line tuning===
No real laser is truly monochromatic; all lasers can emit light over some range of frequencies, known as the linewidth of the laser transition. In most lasers, this linewidth is quite narrow (for example, the  nm wavelength transition of a has a linewidth of approximately 120 GHz, or 0.45 nm). Tuning of the laser output across this range can be achieved by placing wavelength-selective optical elements (such as an etalon) into the laser&#x27;s optical cavity, to provide selection of a particular longitudinal mode of the cavity.

===Multi-line tuning===
Most laser gain media have a number of transition wavelengths on which laser operation can be achieved. For example, as well as the principal  nm output line, Nd:YAG has weaker transitions at wavelengths of  nm,  nm,  nm,  nm, and a number of other lines. Usually, these lines do not operate unless the gain of the strongest transition is suppressed, such as by use of wavelength-selective dielectric mirrors. If a dispersive element, such as a prism, is introduced into the optical cavity, tilting the cavity&#x27;s mirrors can cause tuning of the laser as it &quot;hops&quot; between different laser lines. Such schemes are common in argon-ion lasers, allowing tuning of the laser to a number of lines from the ultraviolet and blue through to green wavelengths.

===Narrowband tuning===
For some types of lasers, the laser&#x27;s cavity length can be modified, and thus they can be continuously tuned over a significant wavelength range. Distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor lasers and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) use periodic distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) structures to form the mirrors of the optical cavity. If the temperature of the laser is changed, then the index change of the DBR structure causes a shift in its peak reflective wavelength and thus the wavelength of the laser. The tuning range of such lasers is typically a few nanometres, up to a maximum of approximately 6 nm, as the laser temperature is changed over ~50 K. As a rule of thumb, the wavelength is tuned by 0.08 nm/K for DFB lasers operating in the 1,550 nm wavelength regime. Such lasers are commonly used in optical communications applications, such as DWDM-systems, to allow adjustment of the signal wavelength. To get wideband tuning using this technique, some such as Santur Corporation or Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT Corporation) contain an array of such lasers on a single chip and concatenate the tuning ranges.

===Widely tunable lasers===

Sample Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector lasers (SG-DBR) have a much larger tunable range; by the use of vernier-tunable Bragg mirrors and a phase section, a single-mode output range of &gt; 50 nm can be selected. Other technologies to achieve wide tuning ranges for DWDM-systems are:
*External cavity lasers using a MEMS structure for tuning the cavity length, such as devices commercialized by Iolon.
*External cavity lasers using multiple-prism grating arrangements for wide-range tunability.
*DFB laser arrays based on several thermal tuned DFB lasers, in which coarse tuning is achieved by selecting the correct laser bar. Fine tuning is then done thermally, such as in devices commercialized by Santur Corporation.
*Tunable VCSELs, in which one of the two mirror stacks is movable. To achieve sufficient output power out of a VCSEL structure, lasers in the  nm domain are usually either optically pumped or have an additional optical amplifier built into the device.

Rather than placing the resonator mirrors at the edges of the device, the mirrors in a VCSEL are located on the top and bottom of the semiconductor material. Somewhat confusingly, these mirrors are typically DBR devices. This arrangement causes light to &quot;bounce&quot; vertically in a laser chip, so that the light emerges through the top of the device, rather than through the edge. As a result, VCSELs produce beams of a more circular nature than their cousins and beams that do not diverge as rapidly.

, there is no widely tunable VCSEL commercially available any more for DWDM-system application.

It is claimed that the first infrared laser with a tunability of more than one octave was a germanium crystal laser.

===Applications===
The range of applications of tunable lasers is extremely wide. When coupled to the right filter, a tunable source can be tuned over a few hundreds of nanometers with a spectral resolution that can go from 4 nm to 0.3 nm, depending on the wavelength range. With a good enough isolation (&gt;OD4), tunable sources can be used for basic absorption and photoluminescence studies. They can be used for solar cells characterisation in a light-beam-induced current (LBIC) experiment, from which the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a device can be mapped. They can also be used for the characterisation of gold nanoparticles and single-walled carbon nanotube thermopiles, where a wide tunable range from 400 nm to  nm is essential. Tunable sources were recently used for the development of hyperspectral imaging for early detection of retinal diseases where a wide range of wavelengths, a small bandwidth, and outstanding isolation is needed to achieve efficient illumination of the entire retina. Tunable sources can be a powerful tool for reflection and transmission spectroscopy, photobiology, detector calibration, hyperspectral imaging, and steady-state pump probe experiments, to name only a few.

===History===
The first true broadly tunable laser was the dye laser in 1966. Hänsch introduced the first narrow-linewidth tunable laser in 1972. Dye lasers and some vibronic solid-state lasers have extremely large bandwidths, allowing tuning over a range of tens to hundreds of nanometres. Titanium-doped sapphire is the most common tunable solid-state laser, capable of laser operation from 670 nm to  nm wavelengths. Typically these laser systems incorporate a Lyot filter into the laser cavity, which is rotated to tune the laser. Other tuning techniques involve diffraction gratings, prisms, etalons, and combinations of these. Multiple-prism grating arrangements, in several configurations, as described by Duarte, are used in diode, dye, gas, and other tunable lasers.

<text>Ecocomposition is a way of looking at literacy using concepts from ecology. It is a postprocess theory of writing instruction that tries to account for factors beyond hierarchically defined goals within social settings; however, it does not dismiss these goals. Rather, it incorporates them within an ecological view that extends the range of factors affecting the writing process beyond the social to include aspects such as &quot;place&quot; and &quot;nature.&quot; Its main motto, then, is &quot;Writing Takes Place&quot; (also the title of one of Sidney I. Dobrin&#x27;s articles on ecocomposition).

The theory for ecocomposition dates back to Marilyn Cooper&#x27;s 1986 essay &quot;The Ecology of Writing&quot; and Richard Coe&#x27;s &quot;Eco-Logic for the Composition Classroom&quot; (1975). More recently, Dobrin and Weisser (2002) have assembled a more detailed theory of ecocomposition, placing it in relation to ecofeminism, ecocriticism &quot;A Report Card on Ecocriticism&quot;, and environmental ethics. Other scholars (e.g., Reynolds, 2004) have shown its close proximity to social geography. According to ecofeminist scholar Greta Gaard (2001), &quot;at its most inclusive, ecocomposition has the potential to address social issues such as feminism, environmental ethics, multiculturalism, politics, and economics, all by examining matters of form and style, audience and argumentation, and reliable sources and documentation&quot; (p. 163).

Ecocomposition is one area of scholarly study discussed at the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), a national forum for writing instructors and scholars. As an educational endeavor, it is linked most closely with progressive education (Dewey, 1915), critical education (Giroux, 1987), and place-based education (Sobel, 2004).

Ecocomposition asks what effects a place has (or different places have) on the writing process. In what ways is our identity influenced by place, and what bearing does this have on our writing? What sets of relationships help us define our place—including the relationship between writer and reader? How do the sometimes contradictory sets of relationships in which we write allow us to see certain possibilities and foreclose others? How do these relationships define reality for each of us in different ways? In this way, ecocomposition understands place as a &quot;premise&quot; of writing.

&quot;Ecology&quot;, in the wide sense in which it was used by Coe and Cooper, includes both natural and social relations. Hence, ecocomposition instructors emphasize not only the writer&#x27;s relationship to physical place but also the social relations among writers and readers. In the classroom, this translates into pedagogical practices that &quot;emphasize the value of fostering community and collaboration throughout the writing process&quot; (Gaard, 2001, p. 166). As a post-process method of writing instruction, ecocomposition attends not only to the process of writing but also what happens to texts after they are written. Thus, ecocomposition instructors focus not only on the process of composition but also on its purpose, encouraging students to write for specific audiences, adapting their style and content to match their purpose and audience.

While a primary concern has been the relationship between the writing process and natural places, concepts of spatiality also apply to cyberspace and online writing—in MUDs, MOOs, Internet Relay Chat, Instant Messages, and e-mail (Syverson, 1999; Yagelski, 2002). Ecocomposition instructors may use blogs or other means by which to allow students to interact with one another and/or write for a real audience beyond the classroom (see, e.g., Jones, 2008).

Ecocomposition should not be confused or conflated with other systemic approaches to writing such as activity theory, which do not account for the dynamic relationship between writing and place but posit a transcendent &quot;context&quot; that affects writing.

<text>PowerDNS is a DNS server program, written in C++ and licensed under the GPL. It runs on most Unix derivatives. PowerDNS features a large number of different &quot;backends&quot; ranging from simple BIND style zonefiles to relational databases and load balancing/failover algorithms. A DNS recursor is provided as a separate program.

== History ==
PowerDNS development began in 1999 and was originally a commercial proprietary product. In November 2002, the source code was made public under the open-source GPL v2 license.

== Features ==
PowerDNS Authoritative Server (pdns_server) consists of a general purpose authoritative server, and multiple dynamically loadable backends that both run multi-threaded. The core handles all packet processing and DNS intelligence, while one or more backends deliver DNS records using arbitrary storage methods.

Zone transfers and update notifications are supported, and the processes can run &quot;unprivileged&quot; and &quot;chrooted&quot;. Various &quot;caches&quot; are maintained to speed up query processing. &quot;Run-time control&quot; is available through the pdns_control command, which allows reloading of separate zones, cache purges, zone notifications and dumps statistics in Multi Router Traffic Grapher / rrdtool format. Realtime information can also be obtained through the optional built-in web server.

There are many independent projects to create management interfaces for PowerDNS.

=== DNSSEC ===
The PowerDNS Authoritative Server supports DNSSEC as of version 3.0. While pre-signed zones can be served, it is also possible to perform online signing &amp; key management. This has the upside of being relatively easy, but the downside that the cryptographic keying material is present on the servers itself (which is also true of any HTTPS server when not used with a HSM for example).

== Recursor ==
PowerDNS Recursor (pdns_recursor) is a &quot;resolving&quot; DNS server, that runs as a separate process.

This part of PowerDNS uses a combination of native threads and user-space threads, through the use of Boost and the MTasker library, which is a simple cooperative multitasking library. It is also available as a standalone package.

It does not have to run a pdns_server process as a gatekeeper for pdns_recursor, if the goal is simply to provide caching/recursing/resolving nameservice as running pdns_recursor on its own is even more efficient than behind the authoritative component.

Support for DNSSEC validation was added to the pdns_recursor in version 4.0.

== DNSdist ==
PowerDNS DNSdist (dnsdist) is a caching DNS proxy, with many features including:

* Load Balancing of DNS Queries
* DNS Encryption Support - DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS, both upstream and downstream (i.e. to clients and backends)
* Lua Policy Engine - Extensive capabilities for creating rules for processing DNS packets, such as changing the response, re-routing a query or blocking traffic over a max QPS from a subnet.
* Dynamic Rule Generation - Used to create Dynamic Blocks which are short-lived rules, automatically inserted based on configurable thresholds and the analysis of recently received traffic. Used to deal with DoS attacks

DNSdist is available as a standalone package, and can be deployed with PowerDNS Authoritative Server or Recursor, or any other third-party DNS server.

<text>The Benin national football team (French: Équipe nationale de Football du Benin), nicknamed &quot;Les Guépards (The Cheetahs)&quot;, represents Benin in men&#x27;s international association football and are controlled by the Benin Football Federation. They were known as Dahomey until 1975, when the Republic of Dahomey became Benin.

Benin have been affiliated with FIFA since 1962 and are a member of the Confederation of African Football since 1969. They have never qualified for the World Cup, but have participated at four Africa Cups of Nations in 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2019, never placing in the top two in the group stage at all of these occasions. However, Benin has a unique record as the country is the first national team to reach the quarter-finals of an AFCON edition without gaining a single win in their AFCON history.

==History==
Benin hosted its first official international match on 8 November 1959, a 1–0 loss to Nigeria. The match was played while the country was still a French dependency, prior to its independence on 1 August 1960.

Benin qualified for the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations, their first AFCON in history. However, they lost all three matches to South Africa, Morocco and again Nigeria. Benin&#x27;s only goal was scored by Moussa Latoundji against Nigeria.

History repeated itself again in 2008, when Benin lost to Mali, the Ivory Coast and yet again Nigeria. They also scored only once through Razak Omotoyossi in the 4–1 defeat to the Ivory Coast.

In 2010, the Benin Football Federation&#x27;s president Anjorin Moucharaf was arrested. Members of the BFF decried the imprisonment, saying that Moucharaf had been unjustly accused of fraud, leading to 12 of the 15 board members resigning in protest.

In the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Benin topped their group in the second round. They started with a defeat to Angola but went on to win the next four matches and ensure their qualification before the final day. In the third round of the qualifiers, Benin finished second in their group, three points behind Ghana. Despite not qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Benin&#x27;s second-place finish ensured their qualification to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, where they drew against Mozambique to receive their first ever point at the AFCON. The Squirrels then lost their other two matches against Nigeria and defending champions Egypt to finish third in their group and fail to progress to the next round. After this performance, on 8 February 2010, the BFF, not willing to accept a group stage exit for the third time in a row, dissolved the national team and sacked coach Michel Dussuyer, as well as the rest of his staff. Dussuyer was unaware that he had been sacked and claimed that he had not done anything wrong. The team became an innocent victim of enraged African countries failing to accept defeat at major tournaments and disbanding their national teams in the early 2010s, along with Nigeria, the team that Benin have met in the group stage of all three of their AFCONs before their disbandment, which were suspended for two years by President Goodluck Jonathan after the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In the second round of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Benin were placed in Group H with Algeria, Mali and Rwanda. They finished third in their group, failing to advance to the next round.

On 9 May 2016, FIFA suspended Benin for unknown reasons.

At the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, despite advancing only as the third-best third-placed team, Benin reunited with Dussuyer, reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to eventual runners-up Senegal, with a shock win over tournament favourites Morocco on penalties.

<doc id="1198476" wikidata="Q2389430" url="?curid=1198476" title="Drupada">
<text>Drupada (), also known as Yajnasena (, ), is the king of the southern part of Panchala Kingdom, in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He is the father of Draupadi, the epic&#x27;s lead female character. In the Kurukshetra War as the head of 1 akshauhini army, Drupada fought from the side of his sons-in-law, the Pandavas, and was killed by his childhood friend and rival, Drona.

==Early life and family==

According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Drupada is the son of Prishata, the king of Panchala Kingdom and his birth name was Yajnasena. Some Puranic scriptures provide a contradictory genealogy, according to which Drupada is the son of Somaka and Prishata is Somaka’s great grandfather.

Drupada&#x27;s early life is narrated in the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; of the epic, according to which he goes to the hermitage of the sage Bharadvaja for education and befriends Drona, his classmate and Bhardwaja&#x27;s son. Drupada assures Drona that once he becomes the king, he would share half of his kingdom with Drona. After completing his education, Drupada returns to Panchala.

The wife of Drupada is addressed as Prishati (lit. &#x27;daughter-in-law of Prishata&#x27;) in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The epic also records Drupada praying to the god Shiva, after which Shikhandi—the reincarnation of princess Amba—is born. Different versions of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; portray Drupada&#x27;s family uniquely. In most versions, Shikhandi is the biological child of Drupada, while Dhristadyumna and Draupadi are born from a fire sacrifice organised by him. (See #Kingship for details) In some versions, Uttamaujas and Yudhamanyu, the two princes who protected the hero Arjuna during the Kurukshetra War, are mentioned as two other sons of Drupada. The Chaturdhara compilation mentions that Drupada has eleven sons, naming in addition to the aforementioned children: Satyajita, Kumara, Vrika, Panchalya, Suratha, Shatrunjaya and Janmejaya.

==Kingship==
Drupada becomes the king of Panchala after the death of Prishata. According to the Adi Parva of the epic, his capital was known as Kampilya. Meanwhile, Drona lives a life of poverty but after his son, Ashvatthama, is teased for being so poor that he is unable to afford milk, he approaches Drupada for help. Drupada, now conscious of the difference of status between them, refuses to acknowledge their friendship and shuns Drona, and calls him a beggar.
Drona becomes infuriated and vows to avenge the insult. After leaving the palace, he wanders about in search of disciples who are capable of confronting Drupada. He is later employed by Bhishma to train the Kuru princes—the Pandava brothers and the Kaurava brothers. After their military education ends, Drona asks them to defeat and capture Drupada as his &quot;gurudakshina&quot; (fees). The princes attack Drupada, but the latter is able to defeat all the Kauravas. Then the Pandavas, led by Arjuna, capture Drupada, binding him in ropes and bringing him to Drona. Upon Drupada&#x27;s request, Drona agrees to maintain friendly relations in future. He is set free, but the country of Panchala is divided into two parts, giving its one part to Drupada, and the other part to Drona.

Though both the kingdoms are on friendly terms, Drupada does not forget his insult at the hands of Drona. Realising that neither he nor his children are capable enough to defeat Drona, Drupada desires to have a son powerful enough to take revenge on Drona. He consults several seers and eventually approaches Yaja and Upayaja, two sage brothers, to help him obtain a powerful son. Initially they refuse, but after Drupada serves them for a year, they agree to perform a &quot;yajna&quot; (fire-sacrifice). After its completion, they instruct Prishati—the wife of Drupada—to consume the sacrificial offering, but she refuses as she had saffron paste in her mouth and asks them to wait till she washed herself. Criticising her untimely request, Yaja pours the offering into the altar of the sacrifice. A boy and a girl emerge from it, who accept Drupada and Prishati as their parents. They are named Dhrishtadyumna and Krishnā (Draupadi) respectively, and their birth is followed by divine prophecy that Dhrishtadyumna would kill Drona and Draupadi would bring the end of the Kauravas.

== Svayamvara of Draupadi ==

Drupada, being earlier defeated by Arjuna, is greatly impressed by his skills and intends to wed him to Draupadi. However, at this time the Pandavas are thought to be dead after the burning of Lakshagraha, so he arranges a &quot;svayamvara&quot; (self-choice ceremony) for Draupadi to choose her husband. To win Draupadi&#x27;s hand, the participants have to string an enormous bow and shoot an arrow through the eye of a revolving fish while looking into its reflection in the water. All the kings including Shalya, Jarasandha, Karna, and Duryodhana fail to even string the bow. However Karna&#x27;s participation is a subject to debate as in some renditions it is said that Draupadi refused to marry Karna and did not allow him to participate on the account of him being the son of a suta. The Pandavas, disguised as brahmins, are present at the &quot;svayamvara&quot; and with no other prince left to participate, Arjuna completes the task. With Arjuna&#x27;s identity unknown to him, Drupada reluctantly gives his permission, but is attacked by other kings for humiliating them by giving Draupadi to a brahmin. Arjuna then saves him and takes Draupadi with him. When the brothers and Draupadi are about to greet their mother Kunti, they decide to play a prank on her by announcing that they had brought some alms. Kunti asks her sons to share whatever had been brought. The imperative of acting on their mother&#x27;s words and the propriety of marriage to five husbands is discussed at Drupada&#x27;s palace, with Drupada and Dhristadyumna fiercely opposed to Draupadi marrying anyone other than Arjuna. However, sage Vyasa and Lord Krishna support Kunti&#x27;s proposal and sanction the marriage, assuaging Drupada&#x27;s fears.

== Role in Kurukshetra War ==
Drupada fights on the side of the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. Bhishma names him a &quot;Maharathi&quot;. On the first day, he fights Jayadaratha. After a long drawn duel, Drupada is finally defeated and flees. During the night of the 14th day, he is defeated by Vrishasena and is rendered unconscious. After he is taken away, Vrishasena massacres most of his army as well. He along with Virata fought and were killed by Drona on the 15th day of the war. He was badly injured and killed by Drona after a long sword fight. After his death, Drona salutes his body saying with tears in his eyes that he had to kill his friend.

<text>Shaw Air Force Base (Shaw AFB) is a United States Air Force (USAF) base located approximately west-northwest of downtown Sumter, South Carolina. It is one of the largest military bases operated by the United States, and is under the jurisdiction of USAF Air Combat Command (ACC). The 20th Fighter Wing (20th FW) is the host unit.

==History==
=== Lt. Ervin David Shaw ===
The base is named in honor of World War I pilot 1st Lieutenant Ervin David Shaw. Lt. Shaw was one of the first Americans to fly combat missions in World War I. Shaw, a Sumter County native, was assigned to No. 48 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, as a member of the Royal Canadian Flying Corps. Shaw died after three enemy aircraft attacked his Bristol F.2B while he was returning from a reconnaissance mission on 9 July 1918. Shaw downed one of his attackers before he was killed.

===World War II===
Shaw Field was activated on 30 August 1941 and placed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Air Corps Southeast Air Corps Training Center. The mission of the new airfield was a basic (Phase II) flying school to instruct air cadets in flying, and the Air Corps Basic Flying School was activated at the field on 26 June to operate the school. The airfield consisted of three runways and several auxiliary airfields.
* Shaw AAF Aux No. 1 – (Burnt Gin Airfield), Wedgefield, South Carolina 
* Shaw AAF Aux No. 2 – (Rembert Airfield), Rembert, South Carolina 
* Shaw AAF Aux No. 3 – (Monaghan Airfield), Sumter, South Carolina 
* Shaw AAF Aux No. 4 – (Sumter Airfield), Sumter, South Carolina 

Flying activities at the field began on 22 October 1941 using Vultee BT-13 Valiants. Enough construction was completed for the first group of cadets entered training 15 December 1941, and the first class completed training in February 1942. The concrete parking ramp was completed during May 1942.

In October 1942, the flight training was changed to Advanced (Phase III) flying training and AT-6 Texan single-engine and Beech AT-10 twin-engine trainers were used. During World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) Pilot School, under the USAAF Southeast Training Center trained more than 8,600 pilots in the basic and advanced flying curriculum, its graduates were then sent to Advanced Flight Training in single or multi-engine aircraft.

On 1 April 1945 jurisdiction of Shaw Field was transferred to the First Air Force. The 139th Army Air Force Base Unit, I Fighter Command became the host unit. and pilots were sent to Shaw for fighter transition training in Republic P-47 Thunderbolt single-engined fighters.

For a brief time, Shaw Field also served as a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp. The first group of German POWs arrived on 1 March 1945. Eventually, 175 of them lived in an encampment just off the main base, on Peach Orchard Road (also known as South Carolina Highway 441) across from Shaw&#x27;s (side) hospital (currently closed) gate and worked on local farms in the area. They departed in the early months of 1946 for the rebuilding of European cities and towns that were devastated during the war. Those prisoners were eventually repatriated to Germany around 1947, with some returning to the Shaw and Sumter area and obtaining their U.S. citizenship.

===Postwar era===
Shaw Army Airfield was designated a permanent USAAF installation after the war, being transferred to Continental Air Forces on 16 April 1945. After a period of reorganization, jurisdiction was transferred to Air Defense Command on 1 March 1946. From July 1946 until May 1947 Shaw was the home of the 414th and 415th Night Fighter Squadrons.

The squadrons flew the P-61 Black Widow in Europe with Ninth Air Force during World War II, and were reassigned back to the United States after the end of hostilities. The 414th was transferred to Caribbean Air Force at Río Hato Army Air Base, Panama in March 1947 to perform an air defense mission of the Panama Canal. The 415th was reassigned to Alaska Air Command at Adak Island, Alaska in May 1947 also to perform an air defense mission, over the Aleutian Islands and the territorial waters of western Alaska.

===United States Air Force===

====20th Fighter Group====

Jurisdiction of Shaw was again transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) on 23 March 1946. The 20th Fighter Group was reassigned to Shaw on 20 October 1946 from Biggs Army Airfield, Texas which was transferred to Strategic Air Command. The 20th FG came under Ninth Air Force.

After the establishment of the United States Air Force (USAF) as a separate military branch in September 1947, Shaw Army Airfield was renamed Shaw Air Force Base, on 13 January 1948 and the 20th Fighter-Bomber Wing was activated on 15 August 1947 with the implementation of the Hobson Plan.

The 20th Fighter Group was first equipped with North American P-51D, then exchanged its P-51&#x27;s in February 1948 for F-84B Thunderjets, the first TAC group to receive operational F-84s. The group was composed of the 55th, 77th and 79th Fighter Squadrons. The F-84s began arriving in February 1948 and ran through May when the full complement was received. Nine were lost in accidents before the remainder were returned to Republic Aviation in May 1949 in exchange for F-84D models. Control over the wing changed hands on 1 February 1949 with its assignment to Fourteenth Air Force.

On 23 September 1949 the 161st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was transferred to the 20th from the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Langley AFB Virginia. The 161st flew the Lockheed RF-80A reconnaissance version of the F-80 Shooting Star. A reduction in USAF units in April 1949 led to a consolidation of units at fewer bases. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the mission of the 161st was to train replacement reconnaissance aircraft pilots. The 161st TFS became the nucleus on which the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing&#x27;s mission at Shaw when the wing transferred there in 1951.

The 20th Fighter Group was reassigned to Langley AFB, Virginia on 1 December 1951 in preparation for a permanent overseas deployment to RAF Wethersfield, England to support NATO.

==== 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing ====
On 1 April 1951, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was transferred to Shaw from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing would remain at Shaw, under various designations, for the next 43 years. The wing&#x27;s mission was to fly photographic, electronic and electronic intelligence missions to support both air and ground operations by American or Allied ground forces through its operational component, the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group. In addition, the 363d provided combat crew training for reconnaissance aircrews.

In addition to the 363 TRW, Headquarters Ninth Air Force was transferred to Shaw from Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina on 1 September 1954.
During the tenure of the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw AFB (1951–1993), the wing was the first USAF operational unit equipped with the following aircraft:
* Martin RB-57A Canberra
* Douglas RB-66 Destroyer
* McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo
* McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II

Over the next four decades, the squadrons under the 363 TRW changed frequently. Nearly all tactical reconnaissance aircraft aircrews in the United States Air Force were trained or stationed at Shaw Air Force Base.

===== 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing =====
On 23 March 1953, the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Group was re-activated at Shaw. The group&#x27;s mission at Shaw AFB was to assume the reconnaissance training mission that was handled previously by the 363d TRW. When elevated to the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing on 8 February 1958, the wing operated the USAF Advanced Flying Training School, Tactical Reconnaissance. The 432d TRW and 363d TRW both were under the 837th Air Division, headquartered at Shaw.

The group initially conducted training with two squadrons (20th, 29th) flying the Republic RF-84F &quot;Thunderflash&quot; and two squadrons (41st, 43d) flying the Martin RB-57A &quot;Canberra&quot;. In 1957, the group upgraded the 20th and 29th to the McDonnell RF-101C &quot;Voodoo&quot;, and the 41st and 43d transitioned to the electronic warfare EB-66C Destroyer.

In a budgetary move, the 432d TRW was inactivated on 8 April 1959. The RF-101C equipped 17th and 18th TRSs were deployed to NATO, being reassigned to the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Laon-Couvron Air Base, France.

=====4411th Combat Crew Training Group=====
The Shaw reconnaissance training mission was taken over by the 4411th Combat Crew Training Group, consisting of RF-101C and EB-66C aircraft. The 4411 CCTG became an operational group under the 363d TRW and continued the training mission at Shaw for reconnaissance aircraft until both it and the 837th Air Division were inactivated on 1 February 1963. All assets from these organizations were then transferred to the 363d TFW.

=====66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing=====

On 1 January 1953 the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was activated at Shaw, replacing the 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the title of which reverted to the Tennessee Air National Guard after World War II, where the 66th Fighter Group served in the European theater as part of Eighth Air Force. The 66th Reconnaissance (later, Strategic Reconnaissance) Group, was a part of Strategic Air Command (SAC) from July 1947 – May 1951, at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana as an Air Force Reserve corollary unit under the guidance of active duty units in order to train and maintain currency in reconnaissance operations for its reserve personnel.

The 66 TRW was formed at Shaw from the RB-26 assets of the 18 TRS and RF-80s transferred from South Korea. Wing and squadrons trained at Shaw prior to deployment to NATO. The 66th had three operational squadrons: the 30th, 302d and 303d TRS. The 30 TRS flew the RB-26 Invader, equipped for night reconnaissance, while the 302d and 303d flew the RF-80A Shooting Star for day reconnaissance.

On 25 June 1953, the 66 TRW departed Shaw, being reassigned to Sembach Air Base, West Germany. Just prior to the wing&#x27;s deployment to NATO, the 303 TRS was reequipped with RF-80As.

====363d Fighter Wing====

By 1980, the advent of reconnaissance satellites made the need for tactical aircraft reconnaissance less and less necessary. The aging and phaseout of the 1960s-era RF-4C aircraft fleet and the utility of the Lockheed TR-1 in Europe for tactical reconnaissance led to the decision by the USAF to realign the mission of the 363rd TRW. The reconnaissance training mission of the wing was terminated in 1981 and beginning in 1982, the wing would become 363d Tactical Fighter Wing (363d TFW), being equipped with General Dynamics F-16 fighter aircraft. On 1 October 1981, the 363 TRW was re-designated .

The 363 TFW received its first F-16 on 26 March 1982. The 363 TFW flew F-16A/B Block 10 aircraft until 1984 then converted to Block 15s; F-16C/D Block 25s in autumn 1985 and Block 42s in late 1991. All aircraft carried the &quot;SW&quot; Tail Code.

On 9 August 1990, the 17 TFS and 33 TFS of 363 TFW became the first F-16 squadrons to deploy to the United Arab Emirates in Operation Desert Shield. Operating from Al Dhafra Air Base as the 363d Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional), along with the 10 TFS from the 50 TFW, Hahn Air Base, Germany. The wing flew combat missions to Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm between 17 January and 28 February 1991.

Following Desert Storm, the 19th and 33d Tactical Fighter Squadrons deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, a coalition effort to enforce the Iraqi No-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel north. The 33 TFS made history when one of its pilots downed an Iraqi aircraft with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. The incident marked the first time an AIM-120 was fired in combat and was the first U.S. F-16 air-to-air kill.

With the closure of Myrtle Beach Air Force Base South Carolina and the inactivation of the 354th Fighter Wing, the 21st Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated at Shaw and received 30 Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt IIs from the inactivating 355th Fighter Squadron on 1 April 1992. All A-10 aircraft with the 21 TFS were designated as OA-10A.

As a result of the August 1992 destruction of Homestead AFB Florida by Hurricane Andrew in September 1992, the 31st Fighter Wing&#x27;s 309th Fighter Squadron was initially evacuated to Shaw AFB prior to the hurricane making landfall. With Homestead unusable for an extended period after the hurricane, on 1 October 1992 the squadron was permanently assigned to the 363 FW.

The 363rd Fighter Wing was inactivated at Shaw AFB on 31 December 1993. The next day, 1 January 1994, the 20th Fighter Wing inactivated at RAF Upper Heyford and reactivated without personnel or equipment at Shaw AFB, returning to the base it had left for duty with NATO forty-one years earlier.

====20th Fighter Wing====
As a result of the end of the Cold War, the USAF made several dramatic changes with the inactivation and re-designation of wings and their units. A significant reduction in forces in Europe was made in the early 1990s, which reflected the changes in Europe after fall of the Berlin Wall.

On 15 December 1993, the flight line at RAF Upper Heyford, England was closed and the host unit, the 20th Fighter Wing, was transferred from USAFE to Air Combat Command. The 20th was reassigned to Shaw AFB, replacing the 363d Fighter Wing as part of the USAF heritage program, which kept senior units on active duty and inactivated newer ones.

Upon activation at Shaw, the 20 FW assumed the personnel and equipment of the inactivated 363 FW. The operational squadrons of the 363d Operations Group were assigned to the 20th Operations Group and re-designated as follows:
* 17th Fighter Squadron -&gt; 77th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D)
* 19th Fighter Squadron -&gt; 78th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D)
* 21st Fighter Squadron -&gt; 55th Fighter Squadron (OA-10A)
* 309th Fighter Squadron -&gt; 79th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D)

Since moving to Shaw in 1994 the 20th has taken part and continues to take part in numerous operations. In September 1994 the 20 FW provided fighter cover for US operations in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. This operation restored democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who had been ousted in September 1991 by military forces within Haiti.

The wing was called to send F-16s in support of NATO operations during the Kosovo War in April 1999. On 4 May 1999 an F-16, &quot;91–0353&quot;, from the 78th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron flying out of Aviano Air Base, Italy, shot down a Yugoslavian MiG-29 (aircraft number &quot;109&quot;). On 10 June 1999 NATO air operations were suspended.

Throughout the 1990s the 20 FW routinely rotated squadrons to enforce the no-fly zones over Iraq. Southern Watch began in August 1992 and ended with the invasion of Iraq in 2003. 20 FW squadrons rotated in and out of the Middle East to support enforcement of the no-fly zone. The 20th routinely sent squadrons to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey supporting the no-fly zone in northern Iraq between January 1997 and March 2003.

After the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001, the U.S. Defense Department developed Noble Eagle to protect US soil in the War on Terrorism. The 20 FW has been tasked with providing patrols over New York City, Washington, DC and any other location the wing is called upon to protect. In addition to Noble Eagle tasking the 20th provides fighter cover for the President of the United States when traveling and at Camp David.

In February 2003 the 20 FW deployed approximately 1,300 service members and 15 aircraft to the 363 AEW at Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia, attached to the provisional CENTAF 363d Air Expeditionary Wing. This deployment was part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the United States actions for the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. In May 2008 the 77 FS deployed its aircraft and airmen along with maintainers from the 20 MXG to Joint Base Balad, where they conducted operations until relieved by the 55 FS in October 2008. The 55th carried out operations in Iraq until January 2009.

During 2009 the three squadrons concentrated on regaining aircrew skill sets that atrophy during a combat deployment, in preparation for the next round of deployments. During 2010 the 55th and 77th once again fought in Iraq. The 77 FS again was the lead 20 FW unit deploying to Joint Base Balad, Iraq in January 2010. The 77th carried out operations there until relieved by the 55 FS in May 2010. The 55th finished its tour in Iraq in October 2010.

The wing has been called to send both personnel and aircraft in support of operations in Afghanistan. One such deployment was in January 2007 when 150 airmen deployed as part of an Air Expeditionary Force. During the October 2009 to February 2010 the 79 FS deployed its aircraft and airmen along with maintainers from the 20 MXG to Bagram AB, Afghanistan.

==== Third US Army ====

In its 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission Recommendations, DoD recommended to relocate the Third US Army Headquarters from Fort Gillem and Fort McPherson, Georgia, to Shaw AFB as a tenant unit on the base. This was a portion of a larger recommendation that would close Fort Gillem and Fort McPherson.

On 1 June 2011, Third Army Headquarters at Shaw, Patton Hall, was dedicated during a ribbon cutting ceremony for their new headquarters. Third Army continued the transfer of its personnel and equipment in order to be fully operational at Shaw AFB by 15 June 2011. An estimated 3,000 people relocated to the Sumter area, including families. This includes approximately 1,200 service members, who will be working out of the $100 million, command and control facility. The new Patton Hall took 22 months to build, has 42 conference rooms, a 200-seat auditorium and can support up to 1,500 personnel.

<doc id="1198479" wikidata="Q1053461" url="?curid=1198479" title="Degree symbol">
<text>The degree symbol or degree sign, , is a glyph or symbol that is used, among other things, to represent degrees of arc (e.g. in geographic coordinate systems), hours (in the medical field), degrees of temperature or alcohol proof. The symbol consists of a small superscript circle.

==History==
The word degree is equivalent to Latin gradus which, since the medieval period, could refer to any stage in a graded system of ranks or steps. The number of the rank in question was indicated by ordinal numbers, in abbreviation with the ordinal indicator (a superscript &quot;o&quot;).

Use of &quot;degree&quot; specifically for the degrees of arc, used in conjunction with Arabic numerals, became common in the 16th century, but this was initially without the use of an ordinal marker or degree symbol: instead, various abbreviation of &quot;gradus&quot; (e.g., Gra., Gr., gr., G.). The modern notation appears in print in the 1570s, with a borderline example by Jacques Pelletier du Mans in 1569, and was popularized by, among others, Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, but didn&#x27;t become universal.

Similarly, the introduction of the temperature scales with degrees in the 18th century was at first without such symbols, but with the word &quot;gradus&quot; spelled out. Use of the degree symbol was introduced for temperature in the later 18th century and became widespread in the early 19th century. Antoine Lavoisier in his &quot;Opuscules physiques et chymiques&quot; (1774) used the ordinal indicator with Arabic numerals – for example, when he wrote in the introduction:
: (p. vi)
:(... a series of experiments [...] firstly, on the existence of that same elastic fluid [...])
The is to be read as meaning &quot;in the first place&quot;, followed by (&quot;in the second place&quot;), etc. In the same work, when Lavoisier gives a temperature, he spells out the word &quot;degree&quot; explicitly, for example (p. 206): (&quot;a temperature of 16 to 17 degrees of the thermometer&quot;) - notice the old spelling for &quot;degré&quot; in the citation.

An early use of the degree symbol for temperature is that by Henry Cavendish in 1776 for degrees of the Fahrenheit scale.

The symbol is also declared as a notation for degrees of arc as early as 1831, in an American mathematics textbook for schools.

== Typography ==
In the case of degrees of angular arc, the degree symbol follows the number without any intervening space, e.g. . The addition of minute and second of arc follows the degree units, with intervening spaces (optionally, non-breaking space) between the sexagesimal degree subdivisions but no spaces between the numbers and units, for example .

In the case of degrees of temperature, three scientific and engineering standards bodies (the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Organization for Standardization and the U.S. Government Printing Office) prescribe printing temperatures with a space between the number and the degree symbol, e.g. . However, in many works with professional typesetting, including scientific works published by the University of Chicago Press or Oxford University Press, the degree symbol is printed with no spaces between the number, the symbol, and the Latin letters &quot;C&quot; or &quot;F&quot; representing Celsius or Fahrenheit, respectively, e.g. . This is also the practice of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Both ASTM International and NIST, the official US entities related to the standardization of the use of units, require a space between the numerical value and the unit designator, except when the degree symbol alone is used to denote an angular value.

Use of the degree symbol to refer to temperatures measured in kelvins (symbol: K) was abolished in 1967 by the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). Therefore, the triple point of water, for instance, is written simply as 273.16 K. The name of the SI unit of temperature is now &quot;kelvin&quot;, in lower case, and no longer &quot;degrees Kelvin&quot;.

In photography, the symbol is used to denote logarithmic film speed grades. In this usage, it follows the number without spacing as in 21° DIN, 5° ASA or ISO 100/21°.

==Encoding==
The degree symbol is included in Unicode as .

For use with wide character fonts, there are also code points for and .

The degree sign was not included in the basic 7-bit ASCII set of 1963. In 1987, the ISO/IEC 8859 standard introduced it at position 0xB0 (176 decimal) in all variants except Part 5 (Cyrillic), 6 (Arabic), 7 (Greek) and 11 (Thai). In 1991, the Unicode standard incorporated all of the ISO/IEC 8859 code points and thus included the degree sign (at U+00B0)..

The Windows Code Page 1252 was an extension of ISO/IEC 8859-1 (8859 Part 1 or &quot;ISO Latin-1&quot;) standard, so it had the degree sign at the same code point, 0xB0. The code point in the older DOS Code Page 437 was 0xF8 (248 decimal); therefore, the Alt code used to enter the symbol directly from the keyboard is +.

== Lookalikes ==
Other characters with similar appearance but different meanings include:
* (indicator used in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese that follows a numeral denoting that it is an ordinal number, rather than a cardinal number; varies with the font and sometimes underlined)
* (superscript letter o)
* (standalone)
** (applied to a letter)
** (applied to a letter)

* (stand alone, typically representing either or )
** (precomposed characters containing this mark also exists)
** 
* (used in superscripted form, ⦵, to mean standard state (chemistry))
** 

==Keyboard entry==

Some computer keyboard layouts, such as the QWERTY layout as used in Italy, the QWERTZ layout as used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the AZERTY layout as used in France and Belgium, have the degree symbol available directly on a key. But the common keyboard layouts in English-speaking countries do not include the degree sign, which then has to be input some other way. The method of inputting depends on the operating system and keyboard mapping being used.

<doc id="1198482" wikidata="Q1982348" url="?curid=1198482" title="Subhadra">
<text>Subhadra (, ) is a princess of Dvārakā mentioned in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. She is the sister of deities Krishna and Balarama in Hindu scriptures. Subhadra married Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers and had a son named Abhimanyu. 

Subhadra is part of the triad of deities worshipped at the Jagannath Temple at Puri, along with Krishna (as Jagannatha) and Balarama (or Balabhadra). One of the chariots in the annual Ratha Yatra is dedicated to her.

==Etymology and other names==
The Sanskrit name &quot;Subhadrā&quot; is made up of two words: &quot;su&quot; and &quot;bhadrā&quot;. The prefix &quot;su&quot; denotes goodness, while &quot;bhadrā&quot; is translated as fortune or excellence. The name means &#x27;glorious&#x27;, &#x27;fortunate&#x27;, &#x27;splendid&#x27;, or &#x27;auspicious&#x27;.

Subhadra is referred to as &quot;Bhadrā&quot; (भद्रा), literally &#x27;fortunate&#x27;, when she is introduced to Arjuna in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. According to the appendix of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, her birth name was &quot;Citrā&quot; (चित्रा) which means &#x27;bright, clear, excellent, or colourful&#x27;.

==Legends==
===Birth===
Subhadra was born to Yadava chief Vasudeva and his wife Rohini, making her the sister of Balarama and Krishna. According to the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, she was the favourite daughter of Vasudeva.

===Marriage to Arjuna===
Subhadra&#x27;s marriage with Arjuna is first narrated in the section &quot;Subhadraharana Parva&quot; of &quot;Adi Parva&quot;, the first book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Different recension of the epic contain varying accounts of the story, with later derivative texts adding more details to it.

According to the &quot;Chaturdhara&quot; Recension of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Arjuna was in the midst of self-imposed pilgrimage, for breaking terms of the agreement he had with his brothers regarding private time with their common wife Draupadi. After he reached the city of Dvaraka and met his maternal cousin Krishna, he attended a festival held at Raivata mountain. There Arjuna saw Subhadra and was smitten by her beauty and wished to marry her. Krishna revealed that she was Vasudeva&#x27;s and Rohini&#x27;s child, and his half-sister. Krishna stated that he could not predict Subhadra&#x27;s decision at her svayamvara (groom selection ceremony) and advised Arjuna to elope with Subhadra. After receiving agreement to a letter sent to Yudhishthira for permission, Arjuna drove a chariot to the hills and took Subhadra with him. After Subhadra&#x27;s guards unsuccessfully attempted to stop them, the Yadavas, the Vrishnis, and the Andhakas held a meeting to discuss the matter. After Krishna comforted them, they agreed, and thus, Arjuna married Subhadra with Vedic rituals. A similar story is included in the &quot;Critical Edition of the Mahabharata&quot;, compiled by Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.

The &quot;Kumbhakonam Edition&quot; (Southern Recension) of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; presents a distinct account of Subhadra&#x27;s abduction, deviating from the &quot;Chaturdhara&quot; version. This rendition transforms the narrative into a mutual love story, providing additional details about the events. According to this version, during his pilgrimage, Arjuna reached Prabhasa, where he encountered Gada, a Yadava chief. Gada told Arjuna about Subhadra, kindling Arjuna&#x27;s desire to marry her. In pursuit of this goal, Arjuna adopted the guise of an ascetic, contemplating under a tree with the hope that Krishna would facilitate his marriage. Simultaneously, in Dvaraka, Krishna, using his divine abilities, became aware of Arjuna&#x27;s aspiration and visited him at Prabhasa. Krishna guided Arjuna to the Raivataka mountain, the site of an impending festival for the prominent Yadavas. During the festivities, Arjuna, accompanied by Krishna, chanced upon Subhadra and was captivated by her allure. Krishna suggested the abduction of Subhadra, to which Arjuna agreed and decided to wait for a suitable moment. Post-festival, Balarama encountered the disguised Arjuna and extended him an invitation to reside in the Dvaraka palace, as a sign of hospitality. Subhadra assumed the caretaker role for the ascetic, while Arjuna, deeply enamored, openly admired her. Subhadra, upon observing him, recognized his resemblance to Arjuna, from him having been previously described by Gada and Krishna. Acknowledging Subhadra&#x27;s reciprocation of affection, Arjuna disclosed his true identity. A grand ritual dedicated to the god Shiva was scheduled on an island near Dvaraka, prompting the Yadavas, led by Balarama, to depart for worship. Seizing the opportune moment, Arjuna eloped with Subhadra.

&quot;The Bhagavata Purana&quot; describes Subhadra&#x27;s role in choosing Arjuna. It also adds a detail about Balarama having picked Duryodhana—one of the Kauravas—as Subhadra&#x27;s groom, without her consent. Knowing that after getting the news of Subhadra&#x27;s having eloped, Balarama would wage a war against Arjuna, Krishna decided to be the charioteer for Arjuna. Arjuna proceeded to take Subhadra and with Krishna in tow, they left. After getting the news that Subhadra had eloped with Arjuna, Balarama consents and conducts the marriage of Subhadra with Arjuna in Dvaraka.

===Marital life===
Upon Arjuna&#x27;s return from exile to Indraprastha—the capital of the Pandavas—with Subhadra, he received a warm welcome. Inquiring about his first wife Draupadi, his brothers revealed her reluctance to meet anyone due to anger. Arjuna, in an attempt to reconcile, presented Subhadra to Draupadi disguised as a simple cowherd. Subhadra, portraying herself as a cowherder and Krishna&#x27;s younger sister, entrusted Draupadi with her belongings, expressing herself as her maid. This gesture cultivated trust and affection, prompting Subhadra to humbly declare her reluctance to replace Draupadi. Touched by this display of love, Draupadi embraced Subhadra, embracing her as a younger sister and acknowledging her as Arjuna&#x27;s wife.

Subhadra stayed with Arjuna in Indraprastha where she gave birth to Abhimanyu. After the Pandavas were forced to spend thirteen years in exile by the Kauravas, Subhadra and Abhimanyu moved to Dvarka. After the exile period ended, Subhadra went to the marriage ceremony of Abhimanyu which was held in the city of Upaplavya. When Abhimanyu perished in the Kurukshetra War, Subhadra lamented over his death. Post-war, she was present in the Ashvamedha Yajna organised by Yudhishthira.

===Later life===
After Pariksit was seated on the throne, while leaving for heaven, Yudhishthira gave the responsibility of keeping both the kingdoms Hastinapura ruled by her grandson and Indraprastha being ruled by Vajranabha, great-grandson of her brother Krishna in harmony. There is no specific mention in the epic about how and when she died but it is believed that after the Pandavas along with Draupadi reached heaven, Subhadra and her daughter-in-law (Uttarā) went to the forest to dwell the rest of their lives as hermits.

== As a goddess ==
===Association with Ekanamsha or Yogamaya===

Subhadra is associated with goddess Ekanamsha or Yogmaya, both forms of primordial goddess Shakti. Kushana images from 2nd-century CE Mathura depict a triad of deities: two gods flanking a goddess. Comparable 9th-century representations in Etah and Ellora mirror this composition. This is identified as the Vrishni triad, featuring Samkarshana (Balarama), Ekanamsha, and Vāsudeva (Krishna). Here, Ekanamsha is an ancient goddess worshipped by the Vrishni people and is identified with Subhadra; later this triad becomes popular in Jagannath sect. 

In Krishna&#x27;s life, Yogamaya plays the role of the facilitator of his earthly birth and his guardian. She takes birth as the daughter of cowherd Nanda and Yashoda, after which her place is swapped with Krishna to protect the latter from the tyrant ruler Kamsa. After warning Kamsa about his impending death, Yogamaya vanishes. According to Devdutt Pattanaik, the scriptures don&#x27;t clarify if Yogmaya becomes Subhadra after fulfilling her role, but the name &#x27;Yogamaya&#x27; is synonymous with Subhadra in Puri, Odisha, where she is worshipped prominently. Professor Lavanya Vemsani believes that the only way to understand Subhadra&#x27;s connection with the goddesses is by considering her as reincarnation of Ekanamsha, who in turn is the Earthly manifestation of Yogmaya. According to her, Yogamaya descends on Earth as Ekanamsha— the daughter of Nanda and Yashoda—and later reincarnates as Subhadra.

===Worship===
Subhadra is one of the three deities worshipped at the Jagannath temple at Puri, along with Krishna (as Jagannatha) and Balarama (or Balabhadra). The idol of Subhadra is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and a symmetric yellow coloured face, contrasting Jagannath&#x27;s black complexion and Balabhadra&#x27;s white complexion. She is decorated with red and black garments and has iconographical elements similar to that of goddess Bhubaneswari which includes a lasso (pasha) and an elephant goad (ankusha). One of the chariots in the annual Ratha Yatra is dedicated to her and is called &quot;Dwarpadalana&quot;, symbolising destruction of evil. Apart from it she is also believed to be worshipped by certain communities in Odisha, West Bengal, Gujarat and Bangladesh.

There is a village called Bhadrajun in the western part of Rajasthan where Subhadra is worshipped as Dhumda mata since the time of Mahabharata. It is believed that, after eloping with her lover Arjuna and a gruelling journey of three days, the couple got married here.

In some texts like the Brahma Purana and the Garga Samhita, Subhadra is mentioned as Devi Shatarupa with Arjuna being Svayambhuva Manu. She is also worshipped as Mata Bhuvaneshvari in some sects. Apart from it, Subhadra is sometimes linked with Goddess Lakshmi by some Vaishnavas.

<text>Norton Utilities is a utility software suite designed to help analyze, configure, optimize and maintain a computer. The latest version of the original series of Norton Utilities is Norton Utilities 16 for Windows XP/Vista/7/8, released 26 October 2012.

Peter Norton published the first version for DOS, &quot;The Norton Utilities, Release 1&quot;, in 1982. Release 2 came out about a year later, subsequent to the first hard drives for the IBM PC line. Peter Norton&#x27;s company was sold to Symantec (now known as Gen Digital) in 1990 and Peter Norton himself no longer has any connection to the brand or company.

==Norton Utilities for DOS and Windows 3.1==
===Version 1.0===
The initial 1982 release supports DOS 1.x and features the UNERASE utility. This allows files to be undeleted by restoring the first letter of the directory entry (a workaround of the FAT file system used in DOS). The UNERASE utility was what launched NU on its path to success. Quoting Peter Norton, &quot;Why did The Norton Utilities become such popular software? Well, industry wisdom has it that software becomes standard either by providing superior capabilities or by solving problems that were previously unsolvable. In 1982, when I sat down at my PC to write Unerase, I was solving a common problem to which there was no readily available solution.&quot;

14 programs are included, on three floppy disks, list price $80:
* UnErase, recovers erased files
* FileFix, repairs damaged files
* DiskLook, complete floppy disk displays and maps
* SecMod, easy changes to floppy disk sectors
* FileHide, interactive hidden file control
* BatHide, automatic hidden file control
* TimeMark, displays date, time, elapsed time
* ScrAtr, sets DOS to work in any colors
* Reverse, work in black on white
* Clear, clears the screen for clarity
* FileSort, keeps floppy disk files by date or name
* DiskOpt, speeds floppy disk access
* Beep, causes the PC speaker to beep
* Print, prints files

===Version 2.0===
The main feature of this DOS 2.x compatible version is FILEFIND, used for searching for files. This 1983 release adds hard disk support, and the PRINT program was renamed LPRINT to avoid conflict with the DOS command introduced in MS-DOS 2.0 as PRINT.COM. Following this release Norton became Utilities Editor of &quot;PC Magazine&quot;.

The executable files were compressed with Realia&#x27;s Spacemaker.

===Version 3.0===
This version, copyrighted 1984 but dated 21 January 1985, includes Beep, Directory Sort, Disk Test, File Attributes, File Find, File Size, Line Print, List Directories, Screen Attributes, System Information, Text Search, Time Mark, Volume Label, Wipe Disk and Wipe File.

===Version 3.1===
This 1986 version adds the Quick UnErase (QU) and Unremove Directory (UD) programs.

===Version 4.0===

Release 4.0 (1987, list $99.95) adds four new programs:
* Ask, used for batch file programming
* File Info, add descriptions up to 65 characters long to each file
* Norton Change Directory, displays a graphic directory tree; change, remove, rename or make directories
* Norton Integrator, a menu system to tie the utilities together. Previously the utilities were accessed by typing the command name (usually a cryptic 2 character name such as FF) at the DOS prompt.

===Version 4.0 Advanced Edition===
This version (list $150), released simultaneously with 4.0 standard edition, is dated 15 May 1987. It adds Speed Disk, a disk defragmenter, and Format Recover.

===Version 4.5 Advanced Edition===

Norton Disk Doctor is the major addition in this 1988 release.
It also includes Wipedisk; Wipefile, a Batch Enhancer and a sector level disk editor; a system information diagnostic utility and a disk caching program (NCACHE), which is between 10 - 50% faster than Microsoft&#x27;s SMARTDrive when properly configured.

===Version 5.0===
Release 5.0 adds new features, including Disk Editor, a utility to perform low level formatting on hard disks and changes such as password protection on the more &quot;dangerous&quot; utilities. It also includes a licensed version of the 4DOS replacement for COMMAND.COM called NDOS. This version also allows the choice of &quot;classic&quot; names (such as FF.EXE) or longer names (such as FINDFAST.EXE); these are configurable in the updated version of the Norton Integrator menu system.

===Version 6.0===

Norton Utilities 6.0 supports DOS 5 and Windows 3.1. It includes Windows Program Manager support, but the tools are still DOS-based, so a set of icons were supplied.

It includes Norton Disk Doctor, Disk Editor, Disk Tools, Speed Disk, Norton Cache, Disk Monitor, Diskreet, NDisk, System Information, NDOS.

The speed of Speed Disk is improved over the previous release.

Diskreet supports Data Encryption Standard.

System Information now includes more detailed information on installed system.

UnErase takes advantage of DOS 5.0&#x27;s Delete Tracking and Mirror File features to recover data. However, MS-DOS 5.0 adds a new codice_1 program, licensed from Norton competitor Central Point Software, which takes advantage of the same Delete Sentry control and Deletion-tracking files. (The ERASE command is an alias for the DEL (Delete) command in the DOS command line). Windows 95&#x27;s Recycle Bin soon further reduced the need for UnErase.

===Version 7.0===
Release 7.0 supports MS-DOS 6.0, DoubleSpace, Stacker and SuperStor disk compression tools.

Tools includes Norton Disk Doctor, Disk Editor, Undelete, SmartCan, NDOS, System Information, File Find, Norton Change Directory.

Speed Disk remains as well, although codice_2 was licensed by Microsoft and incorporated into MS-DOS as codice_3 in MS-DOS 6.0 onward.

&quot;PC Advisor&quot; criticized Norton Utilities 14 for delivering &quot;little that you can&#x27;t already do with Windows&quot;, although it did acknowledge that it brought two things to the table: &quot;The registry tools, which are useful, and the performance monitor, which is interesting but not always useful.&quot;

===End of life===
In 2004, Symantec confirmed it had stopped developing Norton Utilities for Macintosh and Norton SystemWorks for Macintosh, and concentrated its efforts solely on Internet security products for the Mac.

==Symantec Utilities for Macintosh==
Symantec Utilities for Macintosh (SUM) is a set of system utilities from Symantec, developed before Symantec had acquired Peter Norton Computing. SUM started out as a revised version of the MacZap data recovery tools and includes utilities for data recovery, disk partitioning, disk defragmentation, and floppy disk duplication, among others. Later SUM tools may have shared code with Norton Utilities for Macintosh. Some of the functionality from SUM II was incorporated into Norton Utilities 2.0.

SUM v1.1 was published in 1988 and requires a Mac 512Ke or later system. This version also has limited support for MFS-formatted floppy disks.

SUM II was announced for release in August 1989 and includes tools for data backup and data encryption. SUM II v2.0 runs on Macs with System 4.2 or higher and 1 MB of memory. One review mentioned that it is easy to make use of most of SUM II&#x27;s utilities, but at the same time, the file recovery functionality in SUM II is less automated and required more manual configuration compared to the file recovery functionality in Norton Utilities. In September 1991, version 2.1 of SUM II, which would support System 7, was announced.

==Norton Utilities for Unix==
In 1990, Segue Software developed a Unix version of Norton Utilities, in cooperation with Peter Norton Computing and INTERACTIVE Systems Corp. Interactive Systems stopped marketing the software in 1992. In February 1994, AlmondSeed Software, Inc. licensed the software and released it as &quot;The Almond Utilities for UNIX&quot;. AlmondSeed Software released the Utilities for SCO UNIX and Sun Solaris.

=== Historical competitors ===
* Central Point PC Tools and MacTools
* McAfee Nuts &amp; Bolts

==Reviews==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed Norton Utilities 4.5 for DOS as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it was &quot;an essential first-aid kit&quot;. That year Jerry Pournelle said regarding 4.5, &quot;I&#x27;m already on record as saying that everyone needs the Norton Utilities ... [4.5] is a major upgrade, and worth getting. Recommended&quot;.
Darian Graham-Smith of &quot;PC Pro&quot; gave Norton Utilities 14 an overall rating of 2 of 6 stars. He concluded &quot;There&#x27;s simply no good reason to pay this much for such a flimsy collection of tools.&quot;

&quot;PC World&quot; reviewed Norton Utilities 15 and concluded that &quot;Norton Utilities may have outlived its usefulness. If your system isn&#x27;t running as fast as you think it should, uninstalling unnecessary software and pruning background applications using Windows&#x27; own tools or downloadable freebies are a more cost-effective first defense.&quot;

A &quot;PC Magazine&quot; review gave Norton Utilities 15 a score 3 of 5 stars. They argued that Norton Utilities is lagging behind competition, adding that &quot;this PC tune-up utility can give an aged PC a new lease on life, but it lacks some of the features and performance found in competing software.&quot;

ITProPortal.com gave Norton Utilities a rating of 6 out of 10. They concluded, &quot;Norton Utilities did a satisfactory job of de-gunking and increasing the overall performance of our test laptop, but it doesn&#x27;t stack up well against rival suite System Mechanic 11&quot;.

TopTenReviews.com gave Norton Utilities a 7.7-star rating out of 10 and said, &quot;Norton Utilities has good help and support features and is above average in terms of ease of use.&quot;

== Controversies ==
===January 2012 source code hack===
On 17 January 2012, Symantec admitted to their network getting hacked. A hacker known as &quot;Yama Tough&quot; obtained Symantec&#x27;s source code by hacking an Indian Government server. Yama Tough has released parts of the source code, and has threatened to release more. According to Chris Paden, a Symantec spokesman, the source code that was taken was from enterprise products that were between five and six years old.

===September 2012 source code hack===
On 25 September 2012, eight months after the first hack, an affiliate of the hacker group &quot;Anonymous&quot; published the source code for Norton Utilities. Symantec has responded that this was from the same code leaked in January 2012. They have confirmed that the leak included source code for 2006 versions of Norton Utilities, pcAnywhere and Norton AntiVirus.

===2018 Allegations of SpinRite source code theft===
In June 2018 Steve Gibson alleged in his weekly podcast &quot;Security Now!&quot;, that Norton&#x27;s Disk Doctor was not created by Norton but instead was reverse engineered from his ubiquitous SpinRite software without permission or attribution. This, he says, occurred after he refused to accept Peter Norton&#x27;s bid to purchase SpinRite from him. He claimed proof in that random numbers he generated for BIOS compatibility checks were left unchanged in Disk Doctor, presumably because Norton&#x27;s software engineers didn&#x27;t know their purpose. He also alleged that Norton eventually abandoned Disk Doctor because they didn&#x27;t understand how it worked, and therefore couldn&#x27;t support its users.

<text>Hallmark Hall of Fame, originally called Hallmark Television Playhouse, is an anthology program on American television, sponsored by Hallmark Cards, a Kansas Citybased greeting card company. It is the longest-running prime-time series in the history of television; it began airing in 1951 and aired on network television until 2014, with episodes largely limited to one film in a span of several months since the 1980s. Since 1954, all of its productions have been broadcast in color. It was one of the first video productions to telecast in color, a rarity in the 1950s. Many television films have been shown on the program since its debut, though the program began with live telecasts of dramas and then changed to videotaped productions before finally changing to filmed ones.

The series has received eighty-one Emmy Awards, dozens of Christopher and Peabody Awards, nine Golden Globes, and Humanitas Prizes. Once a common practice during the formative years of American television, it is one of the last remaining television programs where the title includes the name of its sponsor. Unlike other long-running TV series still on the air, it differs in that it broadcasts only occasionally and not on a weekly broadcast programming schedule.

The &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; films are made with production values and a budget that is comparable to that of a feature film.

==History==
===Early years===
The series is the direct descendant of two old-time radio dramatic anthologies sponsored previously by Hallmark: &quot;Radio Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, adapting stories from the popular magazine (though the magazine never sponsored the show); and, its successor, &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot;, which premiered on CBS in 1948. &quot;The Hallmark Playhouse&quot; changed to more serious literature from all genres.

&quot;Hallmark Television Playhouse&quot; debuted on December 24, 1951, on the NBC television network, with the first opera written specifically for television, &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; featuring the ballet dancer Nicholas Magallanes.
&quot;Playhouse&quot; was hosted by Sarah Churchill and was a weekly half-hour. In 1953, the series was renamed &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. It was the first time a major corporation developed a television project specifically as a means of promoting its products to the viewing public. The program was such a success that it was restaged by Hallmark several times during a period of fifteen years. &quot;Amahl&quot; was also staged by other NBC television anthologies. Under the supervision of creative executives at its advertising agency, Foote, Cone, and Belding in Chicago, Hallmark also transformed its radio &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot; into a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; format—this time, featuring stories of pioneers of all types in America—from 1953 through 1955.

Early productions included some of the classical works of Shakespeare: &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Biographical subjects were very eclectic, ranging from Florence Nightingale to Father Flanagan to Joan of Arc. Popular Broadway plays such as &quot;Harvey&quot;, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; were made available to a mass audience, most of them with casts that had not appeared in the film versions released to theatres. In a few cases, the actors repeated their original Broadway roles. Actors such as Richard Burton, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Maurice Evans, Katharine Cornell, Julie Harris, Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov all made what were then extremely rare television appearances in these plays.

Two different productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; have been broadcast on the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, one featuring Maurice Evans (1953) and the other a British one featuring Richard Chamberlain (1970). Neither version was more than two hours long. Evans and actress Judith Anderson repeated their famous stage performances of &#x27;Macbeth&#x27; on the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; on two separate occasions, each time with a different supporting cast. The first version in 1954 was telecast live from NBC&#x27;s Brooklyn color studio while the second in 1960 was filmed on location in Scotland and released to movie theaters in Europe after its American telecast. The Richard Chamberlain version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which was also telecast in Britain on &quot;ITV Sunday Night Theatre&quot;, won five Emmys when telecast on the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, out of a total of thirteen nominations. It may have set a record for the most-nominated Shakespeare production to ever be televised.

In 1955, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; switched its format to a special series seen only four to eight times a year around greeting card holidays and in 90-minute or 120-minute length. Starting in 1970, the frequency dropped to two to three times a year. The source material were plays and novels from major authors and were produced with stage actors and actresses.

&quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and the other Shakespeare plays presented on &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; were cut (sometimes drastically) to fit the time limits of a standard film or of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; itself, which during the 1950s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s never ran longer than two hours and frequently even less. It was left to National Educational Television (NET) and its successor, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) to be the pioneers in presenting nearly complete Shakespeare productions on American television.

As a result of Foote, Cone, and Belding Advertising executive and producer Duane C. Bogie&#x27;s influence, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; began to offer original material, such as &quot;Aunt Mary&quot; (1979) and &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Child &quot; (1983), although its lineup still primarily consisted of expensive-looking &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;-style adaptations of American and European literary classics, such as John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; (1983), Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; (1984), and Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1980), &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1984). &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; was the first &quot;Hallmark&quot; production (and to date, one of the very few) to run three hours. The late 1980s featured productions such as &quot;Foxfire&quot; (1987), &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot; (1989), &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall&quot; (1991), &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; (1992), &quot;To Dance with the White Dog&quot; (1993), &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; (1995), and &quot;What the Deaf Man Heard&quot; (1997). One installment, &quot;Promise&quot; (1986), featuring James Garner and James Woods, won five Emmys, two Golden Globes, a Peabody award, a Humanitas Prize, and a Christopher Award.

===Post-NBC ===
For nearly three decades the series was broadcast by NBC, but the network ended its association with the series in 1979 due to declining ratings. Since then, the series has been televised by CBS from 1979 to 1989 (except for briefly on PBS in 1981), then on ABC from 1989 to 1994.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; movies often had twice the budget of other network movies. &quot;Hallmark&quot; movies also ran (in some cases) approximately 10–15 minutes longer (or up to 110 minutes minus commercials) because Hallmark Cards fully sponsored the movies and had fewer commercial breaks. Unlike most network movies of the period, &quot;Hallmark&quot; always filmed on location, and usually filmed for 24 days, compared to 18–20 days for most other TV-movies.

Richard Welsh Company was retained in 1982 to work on developing HoF projects. Brad Moore was placed in charge of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; in 1983.

In February 1992, Hallmark Cards had formed Signboard Hill Productions as sister production company leveraging HHOFP management and expertise to produce some &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; movies.

CBS picked up the series again in 1994. It ran three movies a year over 16 years, until 2011, when it ended its association with the series. The final film was &quot;Beyond the Blackboard&quot;, on April 24, 2011.

On November 27, 2011, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; returned to ABC with &quot;Have a Little Faith&quot;, which debuted to very low ratings for the night. The total number of viewers was estimated at 6.5 million, compared to 13.5 million for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; presentation of &quot;November Christmas&quot; on the weekend after Thanksgiving in 2010. Encore broadcasts of these ABC episodes aired on Hallmark Channel a week after their initial broadcast on ABC. The films were also available for streaming on the website Feeln.com a few days after airing.

In September 2014, it was announced that the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; would air exclusively on the Hallmark Channel for the foreseeable future, ending the program&#x27;s 63-year run on broadcast television. The first episode to debut on Hallmark Channel was &quot;One Christmas Eve&quot;, starring Anne Heche. On the cable channel, four original movies at most would air as a part of the Hall of Fame with multiple encores. The HHOF library would also be available.
In February 2016, Hallmark Cards, which had been directly involved in the production of &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; from its inception, transferred management of the series division to a subsidiary, Crown Media Productions. Hallmark Cards continued to sponsor the program and oversees the creation of films.

== Episodes ==

Only a small number of &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; episodes have been released on VHS and DVD. The 1960 production of &quot;the Tempest&quot; and the 1966 production of &quot;Lamp at Midnight&quot; were released as VHS tapes by Films for the Humanities; they have not been released in DVD format.

The Hallmark Hall of Fame division does not own most of the films from the series from 1951 to the 1970s, as the rights to those films were retained by the producers and/or directors involved. Hallmark Channel has sought to reclaim rights to these films.

==Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions==
Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions LLC (HHOFP) is a TV film production company that produces films for the Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions and is owned by Crown Media Productions.

Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions&#x27; first credited film was an adaptation of &quot;The Tempest&quot; in 1960. Richard Welsh Company was retained in 1982 to work on developing HoF projects. Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions, Inc. was incorporated on September 27, 1994. In February 1992, Hallmark Cards had formed Signboard Hill Productions as sister production company leveraging HHOFP management and expertise. The Hallmark Hall of Fame division, including production, was transferred to affiliate Crown Media Productions.

<doc id="1198497" wikidata="Q582339" url="?curid=1198497" title="Domenico Grimani">
<text>Domenico Grimani (22 February 1461 – 27 August 1523) was an Italian nobleman, theologian and cardinal. Like most noble churchman of his era Grimani was an ecclesiastical pluralist, holding numerous posts and benefices. Desiderius Erasmus dedicated his &quot;Musica&quot; to Grimani.

==Biography==
Born in Venice, he was the eldest of five sons of Antonio Grimani, Doge of Venice from 1521 to 1523, and his wife Catarina Loredan. 

He exhibited an early predilection for humanist studies, which was encouraged by teachers in his native Venice. Subsequently, in the ambit of the Medicean academy in Florence, he moved in the circle of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, among scholars like Pico della Mirandola and Poliziano. He obtained a doctorate in canon law at the University of Padua on 23 October 1487, and was elected a Senator of Venice that same year.

In 1491 Pope Innocent VIII named him papal secretary and, later, protonotary apostolic. He became a cardinal in 1493, an appointment paid by his father with a sum of around 25,000/30,000 ducats. Grimani was ordained a priest in 1498. In 1503, he became Cardinal priest of San Marco Evangelista al Campidoglio, Rome. 

After a period as apostolic administrator in Nicosia, starting from 1497 he was Patriarch of Aquileia, a position he abandoned in favour of his nephew Marino (later also cardinal) in 1517. In 1508 he was named cardinal bishop of Albano, and was also the administrator of the diocese of Urbino (from 1514) and bishop of Ceneda (1517-1520). Grimani was already ill in the 1521 conclave, and died a year and a half later; he was buried in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome, but later his remains were moved to San Francesco della Vigna.

==Legacy==
Grimani was a noted art collector, owning works by artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Giorgione, Titian, Hans Memling, Hieronymus Bosch, Raphael and others: his collection now forms part of the Museo d&#x27;Antichità in the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice, while several of his codexes are in the Archbishop&#x27;s Library at Udine. The Grimani Breviary, now in the Biblioteca Marciana of Venice, is a key work in the late history of Flemish illuminated manuscripts. It was produced in Ghent and Bruges ca 1515-1520 and by 1520 owned, though possibly not originally commissioned, by Domenico Grimani. Several leading artists, including Simon Bening and Gerard David contributed some of their finest work to it.

The cardinal left his collection of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin manuscripts to the religious community at S. Antonio di Castello. Many ancient sculptures were found on land the family had purchased on the Quirinal Hill, once site of an ancient Roman bath and garden.

Grimani also wrote several theological treatises, and translated John Chrysostom&#x27;s homilies.

<text>Franz Oppenheimer (March 30, 1864 – September 30, 1943) was a German Jewish sociologist and political economist, who published also in the area of the fundamental sociology of the state.

==Life and career==

After studying medicine in Freiburg and Berlin, Oppenheimer practiced as a physician in Berlin from 1886 to 1895. From 1890 onward, he began to concern himself with sociopolitical questions and social economics. After his activity as a physician, he was editor-in-chief of the magazine &quot;Welt am Morgen&quot;, where he became acquainted with Friedrich Naumann, who was, at the time, working door-to-door for different daily papers.

In 1909, Oppenheimer earned a PhD in Kiel with a thesis about economist David Ricardo. From 1909 to 1917, Oppenheimer was a Privatdozent in Berlin, then for two years &quot;Titularprofessor&quot;. In 1914 he was one of co-founders of the German Committee for Freeing of Russian Jews. In 1919, he accepted a call to serve as Chair for Sociology and Theoretical Political Economy at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main. This was the first chair dedicated to Sociology in Germany.

A co-operative farm, the so-called &quot;Co-operative in Merhavia&quot;, was founded in 1911 by Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine using a plan for agricultural cooperation written by Oppenheimer. The project eventually failed and Merhavia was transformed in 1922 into a moshav, a different form of communal settlement.

From 1934 to 1935, Oppenheimer taught in Palestine. In 1936 he was appointed an honorary member of the American Sociological Association. In 1938, fleeing Nazi persecution, he emigrated via Tokyo and Shanghai to Los Angeles. In 1941 he became a founding member of &quot;The American Journal of Economics and Sociology&quot;.

Oppenheimer&#x27;s son was Hillel Oppenheimer, a professor of botany at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an Israel Prize recipient.

==Ideas==

===&quot;Der Staat&quot; (&quot;The State&quot;)===
In 1907, Oppenheimer published Der Staat, translated into English in 1922 as &quot;The State&quot;. The book breaks down the origins of the modern state, identifying it as coming from conquering warlords and robber barons taking control over what would have been relatively free communities, each time ramping up the power of the ruling class.

Unlike Locke and others, Oppenheimer rejected the idea of the &quot;social contract&quot; and contributed to the &quot;conquest theory of the state&quot;, heavily influenced by the earlier sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz and his intertribal, intergroup competition, &quot;race-conflict&quot; (Rassenkampf) theories of the sociological genealogy of the state:

Oppenheimer saw the state as the original creator of inequality.

Oppenheimer considered himself a liberal socialist and has been described as pro-market; he thought that nonexploitative economic arrangements would work best in a collectivist environment. He spent much of his life advising people who wished to set up a voluntary, communitarian setting (especially kibbutzim). He rejected the view of anarchists and revolutionary socialists as unnecessarily pessimistic. Not violence, but the path of evolution, would bring about the desired social change. His ideal was a state without class or class interests in which the bureaucracy would become the impartial guardian of the common interests. In the United States Oppenheimer became a popularizer and devotee of the American social reformer Henry George. While Oppenheimer and George regarded the state as a longtime protector of privilege, they also believed that it was radically transformed by democracy. Government administrators were forced to show a humanitarian side which made the political class vulnerable. Oppenheimer, who died in 1943, saw Nazism and Bolshevism as representing last-gasp attempts to resurrect ancient tyranny. He hoped that their downfall would provide the prelude to a truly liberal epoch.

In the 1920s &quot;Der Staat&quot; was a widely read and heatedly discussed book. It was translated into English, French, Hungarian, Serbian, Japanese, Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian and has been influential among libertarians, communitarians, and anarchists.

Oppenheimer was the teacher of German chancellor Ludwig Erhard who rejected his collectivism, but attributed to his professor his own vision of a European society of free and equal men. In 1964 Ludwig Erhard declared that:

==Writings==
Oppenheimer created an extensive oeuvre of approximately 40 books and 400 essays which contain writings on sociology, economics, and the political questions of his time. One of the most renowned was &quot;Der Staat&quot; (&quot;The State&quot;).

<doc id="1198513" wikidata="Q974466" url="?curid=1198513" title="James Gillespie (U.S. politician)">
<text>James Gillespie (1747 – January 10, 1805) was an American lawyer, politician, and Revolutionary War veteran from North Carolina. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1793 and died in office on January 10, 1805. Prior to serving in the U.S. Congress, Gillespie was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons, the North Carolina Senate, the North Carolina Council of State, and held various other positions in the state government. An ardent Anti-Federalist, he voted twice against the ratification of the U.S. Constitution.

==Life==
===Early life===
The &quot;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress&quot; incorrectly gives his birthplace as Kenansville, North Carolina, which did not exist at the time of his birth. Several sources, including William S. Powell&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of North Carolina Biography&quot;, family sources, the National Archives and Records Administration, and North Carolina state publications mention he was born in Ireland in County Monaghan. James Gillespie was one of five children born to David Gillespie and Mrs. (&quot;née&quot; Brison) Gillespie. He was educated at the University of Dublin and immigrated to New Bern, North Carolina, from Ireland with two of his brothers, Archibald and Borthick Gillespie. Borthick would later return to Ireland. His brother Archibald was a prominent citizen of Onslow County and was issued a commission of the peace and dedimus by the governor in 1777. Some allegations of misconduct were placed against Archibald when he was a Justice of the Peace of Onslow County, but they were found to be groundless.

James Gillespie purchased a plantation known as &quot;Golden Grove&quot; located one mile east of Kenansville before the start of the Revolutionary War. The area in which he lived was known as the village of Grove and he was a member of the Grove Presbyterian Church which still maintains an active congregation.

===Revolutionary War and political career===
He was a delegate to the 5th North Carolina Provincial Congress in Halifax that drafted the state constitution.

Gillespie was appointed as captain of the 1st Battalion of Volunteers and the Duplin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the American Revolutionary War. &quot;The State Records of North Carolina&quot;, published in 1907, lists him as the rank of private and sergeant on a list of North Carolina Revolutionary Pensioners. Gillespie also served in the North Carolina House of Commons (1779–1783) from Duplin County, then in the North Carolina Senate (1784–1786, 1789, 1792). He fought and was a participant in the Battles of Heron&#x27;s Bridge, Rockfish Creek, and Elizabethtown as a member of the militia. During the war, his home was burned down by Tories led by Major James Henry Craig. He advanced to the rank of colonel in the militia.

He voted against the ratification of the U.S. Constitution at the first convention in Hillsborough on August 1, 1788. He attended the second convention in Fayetteville in November 1789, elected as a delegate from Duplin County. He voted against the successful ratification on the second vote on November 21, 1789, advocating with others for a Bill of Rights.

Gillespie held various positions in the state government of North Carolina, serving as commissioner of confiscated property, secretary to the governor, superintendent of the press, and on the Council of State. He defeated James Kenan in a North Carolina Senate election in 1791. Gillespie was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1793. He opposed the Jay Treaty signed in 1794 by George Washington with Great Britain. In 1800, Gillespie broke his hip while in Washington, D.C. He died while in office serving as a U.S. congressman on January 10, 1805. He was buried at the Presbyterian Burying Ground in Georgetown, D.C. By an act of Congress, his remains were removed to the Congressional Cemetery in April 1892. A cenotaph at the cemetery is located at Range 31 Site 58; his ashes were transferred to the cemetery and now lie under the marble monument.

==Political and social views==
The &quot;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress&quot; mentions that Gillespie was elected as a candidate to the 3rd U.S. Congress (March 4, 1793 – March 3, 1795) and represented the Anti-Administration party. He later became a Democratic-Republican before being elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 4th and 5th U.S. Congresses (March 4, 1795 – March 3, 1799) and later to the 8th U.S. Congress (March 4, 1803 – January 10, 1805).

Powell&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of North Carolina Biography&quot; mentions Gillespie was a Federalist during his time as congressman.

Gillespie was a slave owner. In the 1790 census he is listed as owning over 2,000 acres and 30 slaves. His family owned a large amount of land in the lower Cape Fear region of North Carolina in Duplin County.

==Personal life==
James Gillespie married Dorcas Mumford of Onslow County, and they had at least 7 children. His son David fought in the War of 1812, was a member of the House of Commons from Bladen County, and was also a councilor of state.

==Legacy==
Two letters from Gillespie to the Governor Richard Caswell have been published as part of the digital publishing initiative &quot;Documenting the American South&quot; at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Libraries. The earlier letter dates to the Revolutionary War in 1777, when Gillespie wrote to the Governor requesting for a William Gillespie to be freed from his confinement at Cross Creek in present-day Fayetteville.

Two additional letters written by Gillespie to James Madison during Madison&#x27;s term as the 5th U.S. Secretary of State have been published on the National Archives and Records Administration website.

Gillespie took part in the meetings to merge Cross Creek and Campbellton into Fayetteville, which named a street, Gillespie Street, in his honor.

A historical marker in Kenansville was dedicated to Gillespie on July 6, 2018, in an event titled &quot;Honoring the Life of a Noteworthy Patriot&quot;, organized by his descendants, the Duplin County Historical Society, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. The historical marker is located next to the Routledge Cemetery in Kenansville.

<doc id="1198519" wikidata="Q1498921" url="?curid=1198519" title="John Harvie">
<text>John Harvie (1742 – February 6, 1807) was an American Founding Father, lawyer and builder from Virginia. He was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, where he signed the Articles of Confederation, in 1777 and 1778. He was a successful lawyer and landowner, as well as the fourth mayor of Richmond, Virginia. Thomas Jefferson was a friend since his childhood; his father was Jefferson&#x27;s guardian. He negotiated a peace treaty in 1774 after the Battle of Point Pleasant. During the American Revolutionary War, he was on the Board of War and operated a prison of war camp on his property, The Barracks.

== Personal life ==
Harvie was born at Belmont Plantation in Albemarle County, Virginia, in 1742, to Scottish immigrant John Harvie Sr. (1706–1767) and Martha Gaines Harvie. His brother Richard managed a store in Charlottesville and had established R. Harvie &amp; Company or Harvie &amp; Company with a partner. Harvie was a close friend of Thomas Jefferson and Robert Morris. His father was Jefferson&#x27;s legal guardian after Peter Jefferson died in 1757. Harvie was a lawyer who settled in Augusta County.

In 1767, Harvie inherited Belmont Plantation. His mother moved to Georgia with his eight siblings. He married Margaret Morton Jones, daughter of Gabriel Jones and Margaret Strother Morton Jones. They had four sons—Lewis, John, Edwin, and Jacquelin—and three daughters, Gabriella, Emily, and Julia. He lived at Belmont until 1780, when he moved to Richmond.

== Career ==
=== Law and business ===
Harvie amassed a fortune through his business and financial skills in Richmond and across the state. He was one of the first directors of Bank of Virginia and was superintendent of subscriptions of capital stock for the bank. He built a successful law practice, one of the first lawyers who practiced at the Albemarle bar.

=== Politics ===
After Governor Dunmore dissolved the House of Burgesses, West Augusta County voters elected Harvie as one of their two delegates to its successor, the five Virginia revolutionary conventions legislature in 1775 and 1776. The following year fellow legislators elected Harvie as one of Virginia&#x27;s delegate to the Second Continental Congress. Harvie never lived in West Augusta County, which never incorporated (the land ultimately became Ohio County, Monongalia County and Yohogania Counties) but trans-Appalachian counties had difficulties both in financing their representatives travel and in finding men willing to take the long and grueling journey to the state capitol.

While at the Continental Congress, Harvie was one of five Virginia delegates to sign the Articles of Confederation on July 9, 1778. He was appointed the registrar of the Land Office in 1780, for which he moved to Richmond. His office was responsible for transactions in the Northwest Territory, western Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. From 1785 to 1786, Harvie served as the mayor of Richmond.

=== Military ===
In 1774, he was named as a commissioner to the Shawnee tribe to negotiate a peace treaty after the Battle of Point Pleasant. He was a colonel in the Virginia militia in 1776. Harvie and Thomas Walker of Castle Hill were assigned as joint commissioners and given plenary powers to negotiate with Native Americans at Fort Pitt.

Colonel Harvie served as a purchasing agent and supply organizer for Virginia&#x27;s militia and Continental Army units. He was also on the Board of War during the American Revolutionary War. Becoming aware of the conditions at Valley Forge, members of Congress came to the encampment to inspect for themselves. Washington&#x27;s reputation and ability to lead were questioned. Harvie told Washington, &quot;My dear General, if you had given some explanation, all these rumors [denigrating Washington] would have been silenced a long time ago.&quot;

Based upon his influence, Harvie procured the establishment of the Prison Camp at The Barracks that held 6,000 Hessian and British soldiers in January 1779. Harvey purchased the 240 acre property from Richard Anderson around 1778. It is located west of Charlottesville. Brick buildings housed troops. It had gardens, farm animals, poultry and other outbuildings. A number of men deserted and settled in the mountains, where they married Native American women. Remaining soldiers were taken north when the camp was closed up in November 1780.
=== Land owner and developer ===
Harvie owned large estates, including Belmont, Pen Park, and The Barracks. In 1798, he bought the Belvidere estate in Richmond from Judge Bushrod Washington. It was compared to other stately manors, like Mount Vernon, and was said to be &quot;an extremely handsome house, and of decidedly superior architecture, being beautifully proportioned&quot;.

He had 12 enslaved men in 1782 and no mention of free males. He had 6 cattle and 7 colts and mules. On January 24, 1782, an ad was published in the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; and &quot;American Advertiser&quot; about Jordan, one of his slaves who ran away. In 1789, Harvie owned 17 enslaved males, 2 of whom were between 12 and 16. He was taxed for his property in Fredricksville Parish of Albemarle County; there were 2 white males and 10 horses.

== Death and legacy==

While he was inspecting the construction of a mansion being built by Benjamin Latrobe, Harvie fell from the roof and suffered injuries that resulted in his death. He died on February 6, 1807, and was buried at the family plot at Belvidere. This property later became part of the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. His wife Margaret inherited the 20-acre Belvidere estate and lived there until 1814, when she sold it.

Harvie Street between Park Avenue and Cary Street in Richmond was named after Harvie. Jacquelin Street is said to have been named after his son, General Jacquelin Harvie.

<text>John Andrew Shulze (July 19, 1775 – November 18, 1852) was a Pennsylvania political leader and the sixth governor of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Muhlenberg family political dynasty.

==Early life and education==

Shulze was born in Tulpehocken Township in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was the son of Eve Elizabeth ( Muhlenberg) and the Rev. Christopher Emmanuel Shulze. Shulze was the grandson of Henry Muhlenberg and the nephew of brothers Peter Muhlenberg and Frederick Muhlenberg, who were leading politicians. Shulze grew up in the Pennsylvania Dutch community speaking their German dialect, and for his entire life would speak English with a noticeable accent.

Shulze studied at Franklin College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and was ordained a minister in the Lutheran church in 1796. He left the ministry due to poor health in 1802 and became a merchant in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Shulze married Susan Kimmell and they had five children together.

==Political career==
Shulze was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1806 and served three terms. From 1813 to 1821, he served in several low offices in Lebanon County. He served as a member of the Pennsylvania Senate for the 8th district from 1821 to 1823.

In 1823, he was elected Governor of Pennsylvania defeating former U.S. Senator Andrew Gregg. A large crowd attended his inaugural ceremonies on December 16, 1823. He was reelected in 1826 over John Sergeant in one of the most lopsided victories in Pennsylvania political history.

Together with Mayor Joseph Watson of Philadelphia, in the mid-1820s Schulze worked to recover young free blacks of a group of about 20 who had been kidnapped from Philadelphia in 1825 and sold into slavery in Mississippi, as well as to prosecute members of the Cannon-Johnson gang of Maryland/Delaware for the crimes. In 1826 he issued extradition notices related to them to the states of Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi. None of the white members were convicted. John Purnell, a mulatto member of the gang, was tried in Philadelphia County Court in 1826, convicted of two counts of kidnapping and sentenced to a fine and 42 years in prison. He died five years later in prison. Patty Cannon, considered the leader of the gang, evaded capture. She was indicted on four counts of murder in 1829 after the remains of four blacks were found buried on her land, but she died in jail before being tried, likely a suicide.

Shulze pushed to establish free compulsory education in Pennsylvania. Although it failed to pass during his administration, he laid the groundwork for its adoption and funding under his successor, George Wolf. He also oversaw major canal and road building projects in the state.

==Later life and legacy==
Shulze declined to run for a third term and retired to Montoursville, Pennsylvania. He returned to public life briefly to become a delegate to the first national convention of the Whig Party in 1839. In 1840, he served as President of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Electoral College which elected William Henry Harrison as the ninth President of the United States.

He died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, November 18, 1852, and was buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery. His widow and former First Lady of Pennsylvania, Susan Kimmell Shulze, died on October 4, 1860. She is also buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster.

Shulze Hall, located on the campus of Penn State University, is named in his honor.

<text>A 24-hour comic is a 24-page comic book written, drawn, and completed in 24 hours. Cartoonist Scott McCloud came up with the challenge in 1990 as a creative exercise for himself and fellow comics artist Stephen R. Bissette. Beginning in 2004, writer Nat Gertler helped popularize the form by organizing annual 24 Hour Comics Days (usually held in October), which now take place regularly in the United States and many other countries worldwide.

== History ==
To prove it could be done, McCloud drew the first 24-hour comic on August 31, 1990, and Bissette did his on September 5.

Word of the challenge slowly spread, especially as Dave Sim published his own 24-hour comic, as well as those of McCloud, Bissette, and Neil Gaiman, in the back of his popular &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot;. Eventually Scott McCloud had collected six 24-hour comics on his website from different, well-known comic-creators. Creators Erik Larsen and Chris Eliopoulos published their 24-hour stories together in the one-shot comic &quot;Image-Two-In-One featuring The Herculean and Duncan&quot; (&quot;The Herculean&quot; being Larsen&#x27;s creation, and &quot;Duncan&quot; being Eliopoulos&#x27;).

Until 2004 (when participation in 24-hour comics expanded exponentially), McCloud kept an archive of all completed 24-hour comics on his website. That archive was later maintained by About Comics; it is now maintained by the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum, which also has physical holdings of hundreds of completed 24-hour comics.

== Rules ==
As originator of the challenge, Scott McCloud has established rules for a comic to qualify: It must be begun and completed within 24 consecutive hours. Only one person may be directly involved in its creation, and it must span 24 pages, or (if an infinite canvas format webcomic is being made) 100 panels.

The creator may gather research materials and drawing tools beforehand, but cannot plan the comic&#x27;s plot ahead of time or put anything on paper (such as designs and character sketches) until they are ready for the 24 hours to begin. Any breaks (for food, sleep, or any other purpose) are counted as part of the 24 hours.

If the cartoonist fails to finish the comic in 24 hours, there are two courses of action suggested: Stop the comic at the 24-hour mark, or continue working until all 24 pages are done. The former is known as &quot;the Gaiman variation&quot; after Neil Gaiman&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt, and the latter is called &quot;the Eastman variation&quot; after Kevin Eastman&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt. Scott McCloud calls both of these &quot;noble failures&quot;, which he continued to list on his site when he believed that the creator intended to finish the project within the specified amount of time.

==Events==
Nat Gertler/About Comics organized &quot;24 Hour Comics Day&quot; on April 24, 2004. On this day, comics creators around the world were invited to spend the day making a 24-hour comic. Many comic book stores supported this event by setting up space for participating artists to work on their comic. It attracted many writers and artists, working both in print and web media.

In 2005, the second annual 24 Hour Comics Day began on Saturday April 23, such that the 24 hours ended on the 24th, with over 800 cartoonists taking part at organized events with other folks taking the challenge at home. 2006&#x27;s 24 Hour Comics Day fell on October 7 of that year, and had over 1200 participants at official event locations in 17 countries around the globe.

Leadership of 24 Hour Comics Day has been passed over to ComicsPRO, a U.S.-based comic book retailer organization. They held the 2008 event on October 18.

The School of Visual Arts hosts a &quot;24-hour Comic Day&quot; every year, but due to class schedules, the date varies. The Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) has an annual, campus-wide event for all majors that includes a 24 Hour Comic challenge for the Sequential Arts program. This event, called &quot;Generate,&quot; happens in the fall of each year. In 2013 it occurred between Oct. 4th-5th, from 10am.-10am.

=== Europe, Asia and beyond ===
Lo Spazio Bianco organized &quot;24 Hour Italy Comics Day,&quot; for creators in Italy, beginning on October 1, 2005, with authorization from McCloud and Gertler. 24 Hour Comic events have also been held in Croatia and France.

Pulp Faction organise an Australian event known as the Comikaze 24 Hour Challenge over the Queen&#x27;s Birthday weekend every year since 2005.

Since 2006 Comicworld (www.comicworld.gr) is responsible for organizing the event in the Greek cities of Athens &amp; Thessaloniki. In 2006 they gathered more than 50 participants in the same place. Every year they publish a graphic novel with the best three stories created in the event.

A 24-hour comic challenge was held in a castle on 21–22 March 2015 at Kellie&#x27;s Castle, Batu Gajah, Perak, Malaysia as a collaboration between Port Ipoh, the Malaysian Comic Activist Society (Pekomik) and Malaysian Animation Society (Animas). The event was the &quot;scariest&quot; 24-hour comics challenge — the castle is known as a famous paranormal tourist spot.

In 2017, Malaysia hosted another hardcore 24 hour comic challenge set in Taiping Zoo and Night Safari on 8-9 April 2017, Perak, Malaysia. The event was the first ever international 24 hour comic challenge held in a zoo or safari and featured comic artists from India and Indonesia.

==Similar challenges==
The International 3-Day Novel Contest started in Vancouver in 1977 and now happens all over the world every Labour Day Weekend.

The 24-hour comics idea inspired similar challenges in other art forms:
* 24 Hour Plays — a group of playwrights/actors script and perform a full play by the end of 24 hours
* 48 Hour Film Project — a group of filmmakers/actors script and perform a film by the end of 48 hours
* 24 Hour RPG project — started in 2003; asks designers to produce a playable tabletop role-playing game in 24 hours, and holds frequent &quot;Grand Events&quot; which assign a theme and a time window for designers to compete

<doc id="1198527" wikidata="Q5628099" url="?curid=1198527" title="H. Bruce Franklin">
<text>Howard Bruce Franklin (February 28, 1934 – May 19, 2024) was an American cultural historian and scholar. He was notable for receiving top awards for his lifetime scholarship in fields as diverse as American studies, science fiction, prison literature and marine ecology. He wrote or edited twenty books and three hundred professional articles and participated in making four films. His main areas of academic focus were science fiction, prison literature, environmentalism, the Vietnam War and its aftermath, and American cultural history. He was instrumental in helping to debunk false public speculation that Vietnam was continuing to hold prisoners of war. He helped to establish science fiction writing as a genre worthy of serious academic study. In 2008, the American Studies Association awarded him the &quot;Pearson-Bode Prize&quot; for Lifetime Achievement in American Studies. 

A critic of the Vietnam War, he was one of the founding members of the Bay Area Revolutionary Union, heading its Palo Alto chapter. After a split within the party, he became the leader of a new organization, Venceremos. Venceremos was a largely Chicano Third Worldist organization. 

Franklin was fired from Stanford University in 1972 for allegedly inciting students to riot in connection with those activities. The termination brought nationwide attention to the issue of academic freedom. Franklin was arrested in December 1972 for harboring Ronald Beaty, a federal fugitive after being freed in October during a prison transfer in which one guard was killed and another wounded.

Franklin became a tenured full professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University–Newark in 1975. He also held the John Cotton Dana endowed chair at the institution from 1987 until retiring in 2015. Thereafter, he retained the title of professor emeritus.

==Background==
Born to a working class family in Brooklyn on February 28, 1934, Franklin held numerous jobs while working his way through college. From 1951 to 1952, he was a batch worker at the Mayfair Photofinishing Company. In 1953, he was an upholsterer for the Carb Manufacturing Company, and in 1954 was promoted to foreman of the shipping department. He graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Amherst College in 1955 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. 

In 1956, he married Jane Morgan, a graduate of Duke University. They had three children together and were married until her death in 2023.

From 1955 to 1956, he was a tugboat deckhand and mate for the Pennsylvania RR Marine department, based in Jersey City, New Jersey. He served in the United States Air Force from 1956 to 1959 as a navigator and intelligence officer. In 1966, he resigned his commission in the Air Force Reserve as a protest against the Vietnam War.

Franklin died from corticobasal degeneration at his home in El Cerrito, California, on May 19, 2024, at the age of 90.

==Stanford years==
Franklin earned his doctorate from Stanford University in 1961. He was hired that year at the university as an assistant professor of English; he was promoted to associate professor in 1965. He was also a lecturer in San Jose, California&#x27;s municipal adult education department from 1963 to 1964. 

He became an expert on American writers, particularly Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne. At one point, he served as president of the Melville Society. His first book, &quot;The Wake of the Gods: Melville&#x27;s Mythology&quot;, examined Melville&#x27;s use of mythologies and intellectual milieu from Meso-American to Sanskrit. Franklin wrote a scholarly edition of Melville&#x27;s &quot;The Confidence Man: His Masquerade,&quot; which traced obscure classical and &quot;alien&quot; references embedded in Melville&#x27;s prose.

Franklin and his family spent a year in France from 1966 to 1967. He taught for six months at Stanford&#x27;s campus in Tours, France, and then moved in Paris. There he and his wife Jane studied Marxist theory, helped organize the Free University of Paris, and participated in setting up the European network of GI deserters, who were primarily young men opposed to the Vietnam War. When he returned to the United States in the late 1960s, he became a prominent activist in the movement against the Vietnam War.

===Maoism, Revolutionary Union, and Venceremos===
In 1968, Franklin was one of twenty-four founders of the Revolutionary Union. After Franklin left the RU, the organization became the Revolutionary Communist Party. 

The organization was infiltrated by the FBI, which planted informers within the leadership of the group to heighten members&#x27; &quot;suspicions of each other&quot;. Detailed information about this period and the FBI&#x27;s attempts to &quot;neutralize&quot; (their word) Franklin can be found in the thousands of pages which he later collected under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). He donated this material to the Bancroft Library of the University of California in Berkeley. Doctrinal differences soon emerged between followers of Franklin and followers of Robert Avakian over revolutionary strategy.

In a matter of months Franklin, along with roughly half of RU&#x27;s members, left to join a Chicano-based leftist group in Palo Alto called Venceremos. Some of its members were active in prisoner outreach programs. 

===Termination from Stanford===
At Stanford, in 1971, Franklin was accused of inciting anti-war protests on campus. At a campus rally on February 10, Franklin made a speech protesting a war effort by the United States during the Vietnam War to invade the neighboring nation of Laos. According to the testimony of one witness, Franklin urged students assembled at the rally to disrupt university functions by shutting down its computer facility.

Franklin concluded his speech at that rally by saying:

See, now what we&#x27;re asking is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show that we&#x27;re willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation Center.

A report in the &quot;Stanford Daily&quot; student publication suggested that Franklin urged protestors to &quot;resist police efforts&quot; with the effect of &quot;inciting a riot&quot;. After his speech, students occupied the Stanford computer center, and more than 100 riot police were summoned.

Stanford president Richard Lyman gave Franklin a letter, claiming that he violated an agreement entitled &quot;Statement of Policy on Appointments and Tenure&quot;, with the specific complaint that Franklin &quot;deliberately contributed to a disturbance which forced the cancellation of a speech by Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge at Dinkelspiel Auditorium&quot;. A tenure-review committee was chosen, with professors from assorted academic departments. A lecture hall was converted into a makeshift courtroom. Stanford hired a major Los Angeles law firm, with lead attorney Paul Valentine, to argue the university&#x27;s case, while Franklin, lacking funds as he was unemployed, had to defend himself with advice from a law student. Evidence was heard, witnesses were cross-examined, summations were given, and the panel left to consider its verdict.

Franklin was found guilty of three charges of &quot;inciting student disruptions&quot;. Accordingly, Stanford fired Franklin in 1972. He was the only tenured professor to be fired from Stanford. The termination generated nationwide media exposure and brought attention to the issue of academic freedom and freedom of speech. 

For a period, he continued to be active with Venceremos, and in December 1972 was arrested on charges of harboring Ronald Beaty, a federal fugitive. Other Venceremos members had attempted to free Beaty during a transfer to court and killed one prison guard and wounded another in the process. 

After being terminated from Stanford, Franklin was out of work for the next three years. Blacklisted, Franklin did not have regular employment during these years, although he had brief visiting faculty positions at Wesleyan and Yale universities from 1974 to 1975.

A decade later, in 1985, with the help of a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union, Franklin appealed the termination, and sought back pay, damages, and reinstatement, but the effort was not successful. A state court upheld Stanford&#x27;s ruling, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear the case. ACLU lawyer Margaret Casey said the ruling would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the power of academics to express their thinking freely.

==Rutgers years==
In 1975, Franklin was hired by Rutgers University–Newark as a full professor with tenure. In 1987, he was appointed as the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies, a title he retained until his retirement in 2015. Franklin&#x27;s academic career has diverse areas of scrutiny, which relate mostly to the topic of American cultural history. In 2014, he was influential in organizing Rutgers faculty to block the choice of former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as commencement speaker:

In 2014, Temple University scholar Carolyn Karcher summed up Franklin&#x27;s achievements by saying that he has an &quot;extraordinary gift for teaching us to read our history in our literature and to glean from both insights that can help us alter our future.&quot; Franklin retired in 2016.

===Science fiction===
Franklin had a lifelong passion for science fiction and has been a guest curator on topics about &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. His book &quot;War Stars&quot; was cited by leftist philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky, who bemoaned the prevalence of a recurring theme in popular literature that &quot;we&#x27;re about to face destruction from some terrible, awesome enemy.&quot; Franklin&#x27;s research explored America&#x27;s fascination with superweapons. He argued in &quot;War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination&quot; that popular American books and novels in preceding decades and centuries, which dealt with the themes of superweapons, may have helped to shape national thinking on this subject. When the movie &quot;Independence Day&quot; appeared in 1996, Franklin said &quot;Fundamental to the historical experience of [American] culture are alien invaders who came armed with a superior technology and wiped out the culture that was here.&quot; His book &quot;Future Perfect: American Science Fiction of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1966) identified American authors including Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville as pioneers of this genre who wrote science fiction, contrary to popular understanding. His &quot;Robert A. Heinlein: America as Science Fiction&quot; won the Eaton Award in 1981, and contributed to Franklin receiving the Pilgrim Award for lifetime scholarship in 1983. In his 1988 &quot;War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination&quot; selected by Choice as the Outstanding Academic Book of 1989, Franklin turned his interest in science fiction to an examination of the American fascination with superweapons. His book presents a view that, ironically, from Robert Fulton&#x27;s submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; in the 18th century to the death-dealing weaponry of the late 20th century, superweapons ostensibly designed to end war have proved capable of exterminating the human species. The expanded 2008 edition explores how this cultural history led to the seemingly permanent state of warfare of the 21st century. &quot;War Stars&quot; is informed by Franklin&#x27;s own earlier experience as a navigator and intelligence officer in the Strategic Air Command. In 1990 he was named the Distinguished Scholar for the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts. In 1991, he was Guest Curator for the &quot;Star Trek and the Sixties&quot; exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution; this show subsequently traveled to the Hayden Planetarium.

===Vietnam and its aftermath===
A recurring subject area for Franklin was the history of the Vietnam War and its role in American literature and culture since 1966. His books &quot;M.I.A., or Mythmaking in America&quot; and &quot;Vietnam and America: A Documented History&quot; (which he co-edited) have been used in courses on the Vietnam War. His &quot;Vietnam and Other American Fantasies&quot; (2000) synthesized his previous work and extended it into an overview of 21st-century American culture.

One of Franklin&#x27;s themes in writing about Vietnam is that the supposed existence of surviving American prisoners of war in Vietnam after the war was a myth created after 1980 with the tacit approval of the Reagan administration, and that the psychological foundations of the myth arguably originated from justifications for the war offered by the Nixon before 1973, in that the war had to continue in order to bring the prisoners of war home. In the 1980s and 1990s, many Americans believed, incorrectly, that there were many &quot;prisoners of war are still being held in Indochina&quot; and that the American government was lying to the public about their existence. When Franklin was assembling an anthology in 1996 entitled &quot;The Vietnam War in American Stories, Songs and Poems&quot;, he sent a fax to musician Bruce Springsteen requesting the singer&#x27;s permission to put the song &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; in his anthology; he faxed the request en route to class, and Springsteen&#x27;s office faxed back, agreeing, letting him use the image without charge. His book &quot;Vietnam and America: A Documented History&quot;, which he co-edited with his wife Jane Franklin and Marvin Gettleman and Marilyn Young, was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;valuable anthology of crucial texts and records&quot; which &quot;tersely replays the bitter conflict.&quot; A reviewer in &quot;The Nation&quot; described Franklin&#x27;s writing about the M.I.A. issue as using &quot;elegant economy&quot;. Franklin believed that his students had incorrect ideas about the American involvement in Vietnam, such as that the United States lost the war because it &quot;didn&#x27;t try hard enough&quot;; Franklin felt that his students were unaware of the extent of bomb damage. His book chronicled how the supposed &quot;missing&quot; American soldiers were &quot;known to be dead&quot; but were &quot;kept alive for bureaucratic reasons that backfired.&quot; He described the post-war belief in still-held prisoners of war as a &quot;manufactured issue&quot; and criticized presidential contender Michele Bachmann for bringing up the issue as &quot;pure opportunism.&quot; Franklin was pivotal in helping to debunk the &quot;Missing in Action&quot; myths. New York Times reviewer Todd Gitlin described Franklin&#x27;s &quot;M.I.A.&quot; as &quot;meticulously researched.&quot;

In 2018, at the age of 85, Franklin published &quot;Crash Course: From the Good War to the Forever War&quot;, a history of America from the 1930s to the present, in the form of a memoir. The book takes us from the consciousness of a kid growing up during World War II, through his work as a tugboat mate on the New York waterfront during the murderous gang wars, his experience at a Strategic Air Command navigator and intelligence officer, and his subsequent decades of activism for peace and justice.

===Environmentalism===
Franklin&#x27;s research about menhaden, a fish crucial in the food chain of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, helped spark a mass movement to protect them. In &quot;The Most Important Fish in the Sea&quot;, Franklin examined marine food chains and argued for the importance of menhaden. He showed that many species of fish, which humans eat, depend for their well-being on eating menhaden, and therefore their role in the food chain was vital. Franklin&#x27;s analysis was an interdisciplinary study in American environmental, economic, social, political, and cultural history from the 17th into the 21st centuries. It led to the introduction of two nature conservation bills in Congress. In a review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, his book was described as an &quot;exhaustive examination of issues&quot; using lucid prose &quot;infused with an urgency that depends little on hyperbole and largely on careful documentation&quot;. The book played a leading role in restoring whales to New York and New Jersey waters, and also in persuading the Department of Commerce in 2020 to act to protect menhaden.

===Prisoners and prisons===
A major focus of Franklin&#x27;s research has been the American penal system. &quot;Prison Literature in America: The Victim as Criminal and Artist&quot; (1989) established Franklin as an authority on American prison literature and has been cited by historians, penologists, literary critics, and sociologists. In books such as his 1998 anthology &quot;Prison Writing in 20th-Century America&quot; and &quot;Prison Literature in America&quot;, Franklin argued that convict authors and artists are &quot;innovative creators who have had a deep influence on the mainstream of cultural production&quot;, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. His work was cited in the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to overturn New York State&#x27;s Son of Sam law. He has been an outspoken critic of the American penal system, in terms of violations of human rights. His anthology &quot;Prison Writing in 20th-Century America&quot; about &quot;criminals turned raconteurs&quot; has been called the best anthology of the genre.

<doc id="1198530" wikidata="Q723806" url="?curid=1198530" title="Wyoming State Capitol">
<text>The Wyoming State Capitol is located in the city of Cheyenne. Cheyenne is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Wyoming, also hosting the workspace for the governor, and his staff; Mark Gordon. Built between 1886 and 1890, the capitol is located in Cheyenne and contains the chambers of the Wyoming State Legislature as well as the office of the Governor of Wyoming. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987. The Capitol underwent an extensive three-year renovation and reopened to the public on July 10, 2019.

==History==
The construction of the capitol began prior to Wyoming gaining statehood. Cheyenne was born in 1867 in the path of the transcontinental railroad, when the Union Pacific crews arrived to lay tracks westward. Cheyenne soon laid claim to a higher status than older Wyoming settlements such as those at Fort Laramie, Fort Bridger, and the mining town of South Pass City, changing Cheyenne from a village to a city in a matter of months. The seat of the new Territorial government was established in Cheyenne in 1869.

In 1886, the Ninth Territorial Legislative Assembly authorized construction of the State Capitol. A five-member commission, appointed by Governor Francis E. Warren, was charged with the selection and purchase of the site, selection of an architect and accepting the lowest bids for construction of the building. The commission chose the firm of David W. Gibbs &amp; Company, Architects, to draw plans and specifications. These were accepted in July 1886 and a contract issued to the lowest bidder, Adam Feick &amp; Brother, who broke ground on September 9, 1886.

The Tenth Territorial Legislative Assembly convened in the unfinished building. The two small wings on the east and west were completed in 1890. Crowded conditions persisted with the growth of the state and in 1915 the Thirteenth legislature approved the construction of the House and Senate Chambers, which were completed in March 1917.

The 42nd Legislature in 1974 appropriated funds for the first phase of renovation of the capitol and the project was completed in 1980. Work included stripping and staining all woodwork, painting walls in the original designs and colors, replacing wooden floor beams with steel, concrete and modernizing the wiring, heating, plumbing and air conditioning.

In 2013, the Wyoming State Legislature created a task force to examine potential renovations to the building. The Legislature authorized the renovation project in 2014 with work on the Capitol, the Herschler Building, the utility plant and the tunnels to be completed as a unified project with a budget of $299 million. The project was completed in 2019.

The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, for its role in Wyoming&#x27;s history, including specifically the role it played in hosting conventions that ensured woman&#x27;s suffrage in the state constitution.

==Description==

The capitol is located north of downtown Cheyenne. The exterior approach to the front steps of the capitol features the State Seal in granite.

The architecture of the building is Renaissance Revival, reminiscent of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The sandstone for the building came from quarries in Rawlins, Wyoming, and Fort Collins, Colorado. The building&#x27;s cornerstone was laid on May 18, 1887, with maps, a roster of territorial officers, and other papers inside. During the Centennial of the Capitol in 1987; the cornerstone was removed, these documents were replaced and the cornerstone reset.

While standing in the center of the rotunda, looking up at the base of the dome directly overhead you see the stained glass, imported from England. From underneath it sparkles with blue, purple, and green hues, but the upper side glistens with red, yellow, and orange. The peak of the dome is 146 feet high, and the base is 50 feet in diameter.

The first-floor rotunda is striking, with checkerboard marble floors, columns, and an impressive staircase made of cherry wood brought from Ohio.

The Governor is the only elected official with offices in the capitol building. The four other elected officials have ceremonial offices only.

The Senate chamber is in the west wing of the second-floor building; the House chamber is in the east wing of the second floor. Each chamber contains four large murals by Allen Tupper True, who painted them in August 1917 for a cost of $500 each. The murals depict various aspects of the culture, history, and industry of Wyoming. The murals in the Senate chamber are entitled &quot;Indian Chief Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;Frontier Cavalry Officer&quot;, &quot;Pony Express Rider&quot;, and &quot;Railroad Builders/Surveyors&quot;. The House murals are entitled &quot;Cattlemen&quot;, &quot;Trappers&quot;, &quot;Homesteaders&quot;, and &quot;Stagecoach&quot;. The ceilings of both chambers are inlaid with stained glass from the Midland Paint and Glass Company of Omaha, NE, with the Wyoming State Seal displayed in the center. Both chambers are accessible to visitors by balconies on the third floor. The House has two oil paintings by William Gollings. The wood in both chambers is oak.

== Renovation ==
The Wyoming State Capitol went through a major restoration between 2016 and 2019. Many improvements were made during this time. Some of the improvements included: the addition of stairs, elevators, and restrooms; the restoration of decorative paintings and moldings; and the improvement of the electrical and HVAC systems. During the restoration phase, there were several discoveries of paintings, decorated architectural elements, and woodwork that were all carefully restored. Another major part of the restoration project was to gain back some of the visibility of the dome on the building. To be able to view the dome from North Capitol Avenue, a large atrium on an adjacent building was demolished.

=== The Dome ===
The dome is one of the key architectural features of the Capitol building. It stands out above the skyline, representing Wyoming&#x27;s values. The Dome of the capitol is copper and it tarnished so badly in 1900 they began using gold leaf on the exterior of the dome. The 24-carat gold leaf dome is visible from all roads entering the city. It has been gilded five times, the first in 1900. Only ten out of the fifty United States have gold leaf covered domes on their state capitol buildings. In 2009, the dome was re-covered in gold for $1.3 million. During the restoration process that took place between 2016 and 2019, scaffolding was used to cover the dome until the work on it was complete. The interior dome structure is covered in the signatures of the workers who built the dome. Others have added their signatures over the years up to the present day. Thanks to this restoration work, the dome&#x27;s life expectancy went from a mere 15 years to 90 years.

=== The Vaults ===
On the Garden Level of the Capitol, there sit six vaults that were covered in layers of paint. During the restoration, this paint was carefully removed, to reveal unique paintings hiding beneath, one for each vault door. These vaults were found to have been made by Mosler Safe and Lock Company, which was a well-distinguished safe company at the time. This company was originally called Mosler, Bahmann and Company and was located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Mosler&#x27;s sons would later take over the business and move it to Hamilton, Ohio, where it would be run under the name Mosler Safe and Lock Company.

<text>Dieter Felix Gerhardt (born 1 November 1935) is a former commodore in the South African Navy and commander of the strategic Simon&#x27;s Town naval dockyard. He was arrested by the FBI in New York City in 1983 following information obtained from a Soviet defector. He was convicted of high treason as a spy for the Soviets for a period of twenty years in South Africa together with his second wife, Ruth, who had acted as his courier. Both were released prior to the change of government following the 1994 general election.

==Early life and education== 
Gerhardt was born on 1 November 1935, in Berlin, Nazi Germany.
== Military training ==
Gerhardt joined the South African Navy after his father successfully persuaded naval chief Hugo Biermann to take the troubled teenager under his wing to try to instill discipline in him; he graduated from the Naval Academy in Saldanha Bay in 1956, winning the Sword of Honour. In 1962, he attended a Royal Navy mine school in Portsmouth and completed the parachute training course at RAF Abingdon. After his training in Britain, he was seconded to the Royal Navy. He started his spying career in his late twenties, while still a junior naval officer, by offering his services to the South African Communist Party. Bram Fischer referred him to the Soviet embassy in London, where the &quot;walk-in&quot; was recruited into the GRU, the Soviet military intelligence branch, and instructed to continue his career in the South African military.

==Spy activities==

As part of his service in the Royal Navy, he trained at and served on , and passed classified information about the weapons systems there to the Soviets. Among the systems he compromised through these activities were the SeaCat and Sea Sparrow missiles. He was also responsible for passing the first intelligence information about the French Exocet missile to the Soviets. British journalist and security services specialist Chapman Pincher maintained that, while in London in the late 1960s, Gerhardt was able to interview Royal Navy Polaris submarine crews for potential candidates that the Soviets could approach. It was also during this time that he met his first wife, British-born Janet Coggin, whom he married in 1958.

Coggin says she became aware of her husband&#x27;s Cold War spying activities eight years later in 1966, but chose not to turn him in, fearing that he would be executed, leaving her children fatherless. She says Gerhardt eventually gave her an ultimatum to become a spy too, which she declined, forcing the couple&#x27;s separation. She divorced him in 1966 and moved to Ireland with her children, claiming that she lived in constant fear of the Soviet security services. She subsequently published a book in 1999 about her experiences called &quot;The Spy&#x27;s Wife&quot;.

In 1973, Gerhardt married his second wife, Ruth Johr, a Swiss citizen who author Chapman Pincher claims was already a spy for the German Democratic Republic. According to Gerhardt, he recruited her shortly after they were married. She travelled to Moscow to undergo training.

Gerhardt rose through the ranks of the naval establishment as his career progressed. Upon his return from training in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, he served as the naval liaison officer with the defence company that subsequently become Armscor. From 1972–1978, he was appointed as a senior staff officer to the Chief of the SADF in Pretoria. In this position he was able to access South African Army and Air Force secrets and plans regarding the South African Border War. He claims direct involvement in aspects of Israeli and South Africa&#x27;s military cooperation, using this position in 1975 to pass Israeli secrets to the Soviets, including details of the purchase of Jericho missiles from Israel.

Later, he was appointed commander of the strategically important Simonstown naval dockyard. In this position, he had access to all the South African Naval intelligence reports from the Silvermine listening post near Cape Town, as well as technical details of weapons systems. He reportedly revealed to the Soviets most of the Western naval surveillance techniques for the South Atlantic. During the 1982 Falklands War, Gerhardt was allegedly able to use his position to supply the Soviets with detailed information about the locations of Royal Navy ships in the south Atlantic that the South African Navy intercepted at Silvermine. Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill-Norton publicly contradicted this view, but supported screening of Royal Navy officers who had been in contact with Gerhardt throughout his career.

Gerhardt visited the USSR five times during his career, while his wife travelled with him twice in 1972 and 1976. He was reportedly paid 800,000 Swiss francs by the GRU for his spying activities; his contact in the GRU said that money was not the motive for Gerhardt.

==Arrest, trial and subsequent release==
Gerhardt&#x27;s cover was finally blown by Soviet double agent Vladimir Vetrov (given the codename &quot;Farewell&quot; by France&#x27;s DST intelligence service) He was arrested at his hotel in New York City in January 1983 in a sting operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation while he was taking a degree in mathematics at Syracuse University. The CIA interrogated him for 11 days, during which time he gave up one of his Soviet handlers, Vitaly Shlykov (codename &quot;Bob&quot;). Shlykov, who did not know that the Gerhardts had been arrested, was also arrested on 25 January when he travelled to Zürich under the alias &quot;Mikhail Nikolayev&quot; for a pre-arranged meeting with Ruth Gerhardt. He had in his possession $100,000 in cash that he intended to pay her; he did not disclose his real identity to Swiss authorities, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment for spying.

The then Prime Minister of South Africa P.W. Botha announced Gerhardt&#x27;s arrest to the world in a special press conference on 26 January 1983. Following his deportation to South Africa, Gerhardt and his wife were tried &quot;in camera&quot; in the Cape Town Supreme Court, with the prospect of a death sentence being handed down for high treason. In his trial, Gerhardt stated that the repulsion he felt towards his father&#x27;s right-wing political beliefs drove him to fight apartheid by serving the USSR. According to Gerhardt, he deliberately attempted to sow confusion in the trial by stating in his defence that he had spied for an unnamed third country that was not hostile to South Africa. His first wife described him as a &quot;traditional apartheid-accepting South African&quot;; he had told her that he wanted revenge against the South African government for interning his father, a Nazi sympathizer, during World War II. Ruth Gerhardt claimed in her defence that she thought he was a double agent working for South Africa. Judge George Munnik sentenced him to life imprisonment in December 1983, while his wife Ruth received a 10-year sentence for acting as a courier. The judge said that he would have passed the death sentence on Gerhardt that the prosecution sought if the information he had passed to the Soviet Union had led to the death of a South African soldier.

Ruth Gerhardt served her sentence together with Barbara Hogan and other anti-apartheid dissidents. In 1988, she attempted to gain her freedom by renouncing violence, and thereby take advantage of an offer made by PW Botha to political prisoners like Nelson Mandela, however the request was turned down by Justice Goldstone.

Dieter Gerhardt was one of the imprisoned spies who was mooted for inclusion in a 1989 East-West prisoner exchange amongst a number of countries that did not materialise. In 1990 when FW de Klerk unbanned organisations such as the ANC and released political prisoners like Nelson Mandela, Gerhardt was not one of those who was freed. He was visited in prison on 22 January 1992 by a delegation from the ANC, who were seeking information regarding the SADF that might have assisted them in CODESA negotiations with the National Party government. Gerhardt was released in August 1992 following his application for release, political pressure in South Africa and an appeal by Russian premier Boris Yeltsin to South African President FW de Klerk when the latter visited Moscow after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan said that the former spy&#x27;s release was a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic ties and the signing of a trade agreement between South Africa and the Russian Federation.

Gerhardt moved to Basel, Switzerland, following in the footsteps of his Swiss wife Ruth Gerhardt, who was released in 1990 following a request from the Swiss government. He stated upon his release that: &quot;I did not feel like a traitor or someone who was betraying his colleagues. I was a political activist fighting the evil regime of apartheid. It was nothing personal.&quot; Gerhardt was subsequently granted amnesty in 1999 by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and his rank of rear admiral restored.

==Nuclear weapons controversy==

He claimed that the United States and the Soviet Union met in 1976 to discuss South Africa&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme, and that the Soviets proposed a pre-emptive strike on the Pelindaba plant.

In February 1994, he told Des Blow of the &quot;Johannesburg City Press&quot; that the Vela incident was the result of a joint Israeli-South African nuclear test, code-named &quot;Operation Phoenix&quot;. He stated that he had no official knowledge of the alleged test, but was not ready to provide further details. In a subsequent interview with David Albright in March 1994, he stated that no South African warships had been involved, but declined to provide further details.

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; contends that the mystery surrounding the incident would finally have been resolved if Gerhardt were a more credible source, while other authors suggest that newly declassified documents increase the credibility of his claims.

<text>The Bisnovat (later [[OKB-4 Molniya|Molniya]]) R-4 (NATO reporting name AA-5 &#x27;Ash&#x27;) was an early Soviet long-range air-to-air missile. It was used primarily as the sole weapon of the Tupolev Tu-128 interceptor, matching its RP-S &quot;Smerch&quot; (&#x27;Tornado&#x27;) radar.

==History==
Development of the R-4 began in 1959, initially designated as K-80 or R-80, entering operational service around 1963, together with Tu-128. Like many Soviet weapons, it was made in both semi-active radar homing (R-4R) and infrared-homing (R-4T) versions. Standard Soviet doctrine was to fire the weapons in SARH/IR pairs to increase the odds of a hit. Target altitude was from 8 to 21 km. Importantly for the slow-climbing Tu-128, the missile could be fired even from 8 km below the target.

In 1973 the weapon was modernized to R-4MR (SARH) / MT (IR) standard, with lower minimal target altitude (0.5–1 km), improved seeker performance, and compatibility with the upgraded RP-SM &quot;Smerch-M&quot; radar.

The R-4 survived in limited service until 1990, retiring along with the last Tu-128 aircraft.

<text>Mervyn Malcolm Dymally (May 12, 1926 – October 7, 2012) was an American politician from California. A Democrat, he served in the California State Assembly (1963–1966) and the California State Senate (1967–1975), as the 41st lieutenant governor of California (1975–1979), and in the U.S. House of Representatives (1981–1993). Dymally returned to politics a decade later to again serve in the California State Assembly (2003–2008).

Dymally was the second African-American to hold statewide office in California, following Wilson Riles, who served as California Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 1971.

==Early life and education==
Born in Cedros, Trinidad and Tobago, Dymally first received his secondary education at Naparima College before transferring to Saint Benedict&#x27;s College, both in San Fernando. He is of Dougla (mixed African and Indian) descent.

He moved to the United States to study journalism at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri. After a semester there, he moved to the greater Los Angeles area to attend Chapman University, and completed a Bachelor of Arts in education at California State University, Los Angeles in 1954. Dymally became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity in 1949. Dymally became a U.S. citizen in 1957.

In 1969, while serving in the California State Legislature, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in government from California State University, Sacramento. Dymally earned his doctorate in human behavior from United States International University (later merged into Alliant International University) in San Diego .

==Career==

Dymally was first elected to the California State Assembly, the lower house of the state Legislature, in 1962, from District 53; he was re-elected in 1964.

He was elected to the California State Senate, the Legislature&#x27;s upper house, in 1966; initially for a two-year term. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that state legislatures must reapportion their upper houses on the basis of population; in the process in California, the even-numbered districts elected their senators for full four-year terms in 1966. As Dymally was in District 29, he had to run again in 1968; he won and was re-elected in 1972.

In 1974, Dymally was elected lieutenant governor (49.2%-46.3%) over Republican incumbent John L. Harmer, who had just been appointed to fill a vacancy in the office a month earlier and until then had been Dymally&#x27;s colleague in the state Senate.

Dymally was the first Trinidadian to serve California as a state senator and as lieutenant governor.
He and George L. Brown of Colorado became the first two African Americans elected to the office of lieutenant governor since Oscar Dunn did so in Louisiana during Reconstruction.

In the tightly contested race for lieutenant governor in 1978, Dymally&#x27;s bid for re-election was derailed when Michael Franchetti, an aide to State Senator George Deukmejian, floated a false rumor that Dymally was about to be indicted. The story, coming days before the election, harmed the Dymally campaign, and Dymally lost to Republican Mike Curb.

Franchetti later said that the source of the rumor was a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter, who called the Justice Department trying to confirm its authenticity. Franchetti could not substantiate the rumor but included it in a report. The report was passed to Curb&#x27;s office with the rumor part erased, after which it moved to broadcaster Bill Stout, who announced it as fact on Los Angeles radio station KNX (AM) and its CBS affiliates. (Stout&#x27;s wife worked for Curb.) Then-Attorney General Evelle J. Younger filed a letter of reprimand in Franchetti&#x27;s personnel records, accusing him of a breach of responsibility.

Dymally was an old friend of Peoples Temple founder Jim Jones. When Jones decided to move his congregation to Jonestown, Guyana, Dymally &quot;wrote the Guyanese prime minister [Forbes Burnham] to reassure him that Jones was an upstanding citizen.&quot; The Jonestown compound would be the site of the mass suicide of over 900 people on November 18, 1978.

In 1980, two years after losing the lieutenant governorship, Dymally ran for Congress in District 31, against former U.S. representative Mark W. Hannaford (who had served two terms in a nearby district) and 18-year incumbent Charles H. Wilson, who had been reprimanded by his U.S. House colleagues for financial misconduct in the Koreagate scandal. Dymally won the primary with 49% of the vote, to 24% for Hannaford and just 15% for Wilson; he went on to defeat Republican Don Grimshaw in the general election, 64%-36%. He was one of the first persons of Dougla (mixed African and Indian) origin to serve in Congress.

In 1983 Dymally joined with seven other U.S. representatives to sponsor a resolution to impeach Ronald Reagan over his sudden and unexpected invasion of Grenada. He retired in 1992, after six terms in Congress.

In the 1990s, Dymally served as a paid lobbyist for the country of Mauritania, attempting to present the country as engaged in abolishing every remnant of slavery.

Dymally came out of retirement and returned to the State Assembly in 2002 when Assemblyman Carl Washington was term limited. He served for six years and then, himself term-limited, ran to return to the State Senate in 2008. At 82, he was defeated in the Senate primary by Rod Wright.

Dymally died in Los Angeles and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City.

Mervyn M. Dymally High School, at 88th and San Pedro streets in South Central Los Angeles and part of the Los Angeles Unified School District, is named in his honor.

<text>Romulus Zachariah Linney (December 26, 1841 – April 15, 1910) was an American politician who was a Republican U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1895 and 1901.

==Life and career==
Linney was born in Rutherford County, North Carolina, the son of Martha (&quot;née&quot; Baxter) and William Coplin Linney. He attended common schools, York&#x27;s Collegiate Institute, and Doctor Millen&#x27;s School in Taylorsville, North Carolina. During the American Civil War, he served in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia as a private in Company A of the 7th North Carolina Infantry. He was seriously wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville.

After the war, he engaged in agricultural pursuits and studied law. Admitted to the bar in 1868, he opened a practice in Taylorsville. He was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1870, 1873, and 1882 and then to the United States Congress in 1894, serving three terms in the 44th, 45th, and 46th Congresses (March 4, 1895 – March 3, 1901). While in the North Carolina Senate, Linney was a major proponent of the construction of the Alexander Railroad, then known as the Statesville &amp; Western Railroad.

Linney died in Taylorsville in 1910 and is buried in the Taylorsville Cemetery. He is the great-grandfather of playwright Romulus Linney and great-great-grandfather of actress Laura Linney.

<text>Shantaram is a 2003 novel by Gregory David Roberts, in which a convicted Australian bank robber and heroin addict escapes from Pentridge Prison and flees to India. The novel is commended by many for its vivid portrayal of life in Bombay in the 1980s.

The novel is reportedly influenced by real events in the life of the author, though some claims made by Roberts are contested by others involved in the story.

==Plot summary==
In 1978, Roberts was sentenced to a 19-year imprisonment in Australia after being convicted of a series of armed robberies of building society branches, credit unions, and shops. In July 1980, he escaped from Victoria&#x27;s Pentridge Prison in broad daylight, thereby becoming one of Australia&#x27;s most wanted men for the next ten years.

The protagonist Lindsay (according to the book, Roberts&#x27; fake name) arrives in Bombay carrying a false passport in the name of Lindsay Ford. Mumbai was supposed to be only a stopover on a journey that was to take him from New Zealand to Germany, but he decides to stay in the city. Lindsay soon meets a local man named Prabhakar whom he hires as a guide. Prabhakar soon becomes his friend and names him Lin (Linbaba). Both men visit Prabhakar&#x27;s native village, Sunder, where Prabhakar&#x27;s mother decided to give Lin a new Maharashtrian name, like her own. Because she judged his nature to be blessed with peaceful happiness, she decided to call him &quot;Shantaram&quot;, meaning &quot;Man of God&#x27;s Peace&quot;. On their way back to Mumbai, Lin and Prabhakar are robbed. With all his possessions gone, Lin is forced to live in the slums, which shelters him from the authorities. After a massive fire on the day of his arrival in the slum, he sets up a free health clinic as a way to contribute to the community. He learns about the local culture and customs in this cramped environment, gets to know and love the people he encounters, and even becomes fluent in Marathi, the local language. He also witnesses and battles outbreaks of cholera and firestorms, becomes involved in trading with the lepers, and experiences how ethnic and marital conflicts are resolved in this densely crowded and diverse community.

The novel describes a number of foreigners of various origins, as well as local Indians, highlighting the rich diversity of life in Mumbai. Lin falls in love with Karla, a Swiss-American woman, befriends local artists and actors, landing him roles as an extra in several Bollywood movies, and is recruited by the Mumbai underworld for various criminal operations, including drug and weapons trade. Lin eventually lands in Mumbai&#x27;s Arthur Road Prison. There, along with hundreds of other inmates, he endures brutal physical and mental abuse from the guards, while existing under extremely squalid conditions. However, thanks to the protection of the Afghan mafia don &quot;Abdel Khader Khan&quot;, Lin is eventually released, and begins to work in a black market currency exchange and passport forgery. Having travelled as far as Africa on trips commissioned by the mafia, Lin later goes to Afghanistan to smuggle weapons for mujahideen freedom fighters. When his mentor Khan is killed, Lin realizes he has become everything he grew to loathe and falls into depression after he returns to India. He decides that he must fight for what he believes is right, and build an honest life. The story ends with him planning to go to Sri Lanka, which lays the premise for the sequel to this book.

=== Fact-based elements ===
While parts of the novel, based on Roberts&#x27; known biography, such as Roberts&#x27; criminal history and escape from prison in Australia, are a matter of public record, and read as reportedly factual, numerous significant claims by Roberts remain harder (or impossible) to verify and are disputed by the family of one of the main Indian characters in the book.

There is a great deal of debate as to where the boundaries lie between fact and fiction in the book. Roberts has stated the characters in the story are largely invented, and that he merged different elements taken from true events and people into such events and characters like Prabaker &#x27;of the big smile&#x27;. Prabhakar Kisan Khare was a real-life individual, as are the members of Khare family from the book (Kisan, Rukhma, Kishor and Parvati Khare) whose names appear on government issued identity cards. The family resides in the Navy Nagar slum where the lead character Shantaram also lived. The Khare family disputes many of Roberts&#x27; claims, although they acknowledge close association with Gregory Roberts in the 1980s. Prabhakar died in an accident in 1988 in circumstances matching the event in the book.
In March 2006, the &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; reported they may have discovered the inspiration for the big smile of the character Prabhakar as belonging to a still living cab driver called Kishore, who took Roberts to his home village. Kishore Khare, brother of Prabhakar, who drives tourists around Mumbai, has told his story.

==== Roberts&#x27; position, based on his interviews ====
&quot;With respect, &quot;Shantaram&quot; is not an autobiography, it&#x27;s a novel. If the book reads like an autobiography, I take that as a very high compliment, because I structured the created narrative to read like fiction but feel like fact. I wanted the novel to have the page-turning drive of a work of fiction but to be informed by such a powerful stream of real experience that it had the authentic feel of fact.&quot;

&quot;As with the novel &quot;Shantaram&quot;, the experiences in &quot;The Mountain Shadow&quot; are derived from my own real experiences, and the characters, dialogue, and narrative structure are all created.&quot;

Roberts repeatedly stated this, as on the book&#x27;s official website:
== Publication history ==
Originally, &quot;Shantaram&quot; was published by Scribe Publications as a hardcover and later as a paperback. Following the mediated resolution in 2004 of a dispute that arose in 2003 between Scribe and the book&#x27;s author, Gregory David Roberts, rights to all forms of the local publication of &quot;Shantaram&quot; reverted to the author after Scribe sold its remaining stock of hardbacks. Pan Macmillan then took over publication under the Picador label.

== Reception ==

Megan O&#x27;Grady of The New York Times wrote &quot;Few stand out quite like &quot;Shantaram&quot;&quot;, calling it a &quot;gentle giant&quot;.

Carole Burns of The Washington Post described Gregory David Robert&#x27;s &quot;blatantly autobiographical&quot; novel as sprawling and intelligent.

Emma Lee-Potter of &quot;The Independent&quot; listed it as one of the 12 best Indian novels, calling it a &quot;page-turning debut&quot;.

== Sequels ==
Gregory Roberts has said that &quot;Shantaram&quot; is the first book in a planned quartet. A sequel entitled &quot;The Mountain Shadow&quot; was released on 13 October 2015 by Little Brown. In this long-awaited sequel, Lin strives to survive in the new Bombay run by the new mafia.

==Proposed film adaptation==
When the novel &quot;Shantaram&quot; was published in 2003, several parties, including actor Russell Crowe, expressed interest in a film adaptation. Although Crowe was temporarily attached to a bid, Warner Bros. went forward with a $2 million bid primarily due to actor Johnny Depp&#x27;s expression of love for the book to studio executive Brad Grey. With the rights won, Depp was attached to star in the film, which was to be based on a script written by the book&#x27;s author Gregory David Roberts. Roberts commended the casting choice, and the author said of his intended script, &quot;The screenplay I am writing will be as complex and will have the same sense of layering and texturing. Thematically, it will reflect everything that is in the heart of the book and that is the exile experience, and the power of love to transform and change the heart of a person. But the book is a book and the film is a film—they are different art forms so the film will have an independent life.&quot; In October 2005, Warner Bros. hired screenwriter Eric Roth to rewrite the initial draft created by Roberts. The following November, director Peter Weir was hired by the studio to helm &quot;Shantaram&quot; and develop the script with Roth. The studio originally planned to schedule production for late 2006.

By June 2006, Weir departed from the project with a studio spokesperson citing different interpretations between the director and the studio and producers. In January 2007, director Mira Nair replaced Weir at the helm. The studio anticipated production would begin by autumn 2007 for a 2008 release. Roth began rewriting the script to lower project costs, and actor Amitabh Bachchan joined to star opposite Depp. By November 2007, the anticipated February production start was cancelled by Warner Bros, who cited the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike&#x27;s interference with the script&#x27;s readiness, the impending monsoon season in India, and Depp&#x27;s schedule difficulties in filming between India and New Mexico in the United States. The studio anticipated that production would finally begin in September 2008, but by November 2009, with production not starting, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported the project had been cancelled.

In May 2013, the &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; reported that Warner Bros. had negotiated to retain the film rights until 2015, fuelling speculation that a film adaptation of &quot;Shantaram&quot; was still in the works. In the following October, it was announced that Joel Edgerton would be starring in the leading role, with Eric Roth penning the adaptation and Johnny Depp now involved as a producer. Warner Bros. was in early talks with Garth Davis, co-director of the Emmy-nominated &quot;Top of the Lake&quot;, to make his feature film directing debut on the movie. An article from The Sydney Morning Herald published in April 2021 covered the development of all plans for screen adaptations of the book, saying that Warner Bros. had lost the film rights by 2015 and that a planned movie with Johnny Depp as one of its producers and Joel Edgerton as protagonist had been cancelled.

==TV adaptation==

On 7 June 2018, it was announced that Apple Inc. was developing a television adaptation of the novel for Apple TV+ to be written by Eric Warren Singer who will also executive produce alongside David Manson, Nicole Clemens, Steve Golin, and Andrea Barron with Charlie Hunnam in the lead role. Production companies set to be involved with the potential series include Anonymous Content and Paramount Television. In August 2019, it was announced that production was moving forward with filming set to begin in October 2019. The series will be filmed in Victoria, Australia, with scenes filmed at Docklands Studios Melbourne and HM Prison Pentridge. It was also announced that the series will get 7.4 million Australian dollars in funding from the Australian Government. The series consists of 12 episodes with four episodes directed by Justin Kurzel. Steven Lightfoot has joined the show as showrunner. &quot;Shantaram&quot; premiered on Apple TV+ on 14 October 2022, starring Charlie Hunnam.

<text>Profile Records was one of the earliest hip hop labels. As well as hip-hop they released disco, dance, and electro records.

==History==
In 1980, Cory Robbins, who was 23 at the time and had worked briefly for MCA, wanted to start a record label. He invited his songwriter friend Steve Plotnicki to be a partner. They each borrowed $17,000 from their parents, purchased the little used Panorama Records subsidiary from MCA, and Profile Records was born. Their tiny office opened at 250 West 57th street in NYC on May 1, 1981.

With the success of “Genius Rap” by Dr. Jeckyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, they escaped financial ruin by a mere $2,000. From there it was Gidea Park&#x27;s “Seasons of Gold” that brought more commercial and financial success, becoming Profile Records’ first hit to make the Billboard Hot 100. In 1982 the fledgling label gained international recognition with the club hit &quot;I Specialize in Love&quot;, recorded by Sharon Brown, licensed to Virgin Records in the UK. The label continued its commercial success, with gold and platinum sales with artists such as Dana Dane, Twin Hype, Run DMC, Poor Righteous Teachers, Nemesis, and Paul Hardcastle among others.

In 1985, the label moved to a headquarters at 740 Broadway in New York. The label had numerous sub-labels such as Smile Communications (which later became independent and continued to be controlled by Plotnicki after Profile was acquired), Sea Bright Records, and Robert Hill&#x27;s Zakia Records, the label that launched the career of King Sun and hip hop legends Eric B. &amp; Rakim.

Profile&#x27;s biggest act was Run-D.M.C., which was introduced to Robbins when manager Russell Simmons sent him a demo cassette of &quot;It&#x27;s Like That&quot;. Robbins signed the group soon after.

The partners&#x27; less than amicable split severed not only all business ties but all personal ones too. Robbins, in 2008, said he had no regrets “except for an occasional loss, it was a good experience, a positive experience but I would not change a thing.”

Profile was acquired by Arista Records in 1998, and its catalogue and artists were transferred to Arista. Sony Music Entertainment (owner of Arista since 2004) now manages much of Profile&#x27;s back catalog and master recordings. Most recordings are currently out of print except for the albums of DJ Quik, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock and Run-D.M.C.

<doc id="1198576" wikidata="Q3028965" url="?curid=1198576" title="Takara">
<text>was a Japanese toy company founded in 1955. In March 2006, the company merged with Tomy Company, Ltd. to form Takara Tomy. The Takara motto was(&quot;playing is culture&quot;).

The company focused on traditional toys and board games. They created the Licca-chan dolls, which has been referred to as &quot;Japan&#x27;s Barbie&quot; in Western press. Some of the globally known toys and franchises that Takara invented include Transformers and Beyblade. Takara also held the license to localise and distribute Hasbro products in Japan including The Game of Life, Blythe dolls, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Duel Masters&quot; trading card games. Takara was also involved in software, publishing video games based on its toys like &quot;Transformers&quot; and &quot;Choro Q / Penny Racers&quot;, porting SNK Neo Geo games to consoles, and the &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; series.

== Products ==

===Toys===

In 1960, Takara released the Dakko-Chan () doll which would become a hit in Japan&#x27;s during that era. The nickname was given because of how it &quot;embraces&quot; a person. Also referred to as Winky Dolls in English, in the 1980s the company was criticized overseas for using it as a mascot due to its golliwog-like character and racial undertones. By the end of production in 1988, six million of these dolls were sold.

In 1967, Takara produced the first generation of the Licca-chan doll, which would become very popular in Japan to this day, and which was 21 centimeters tall and had the last name of Kayama, inspired by the musician Yuzo Kayama and actress Yoshiko Kayama. They released the Jenny doll in the 1980s.

In 1975, Takara produced the Diaclone and Microman Micro Change toys. In 1984, the toy line was rebranded by Hasbro as &quot;Transformers&quot;. Takara continued to sell Microman and used it as the basis for the Micronauts toy line. Micronauts were sold internationally by the Mego Corporation. Other transforming toys made by Takara include Brave, Dennō Bōkenki Webdiver, and Daigunder. Both Webdiver and Daigunder toys could interact with TV screens, which proved only but a fad in the early 2000s.

In 1978, Takara developed the Choro-Q, mini pullback cars. Internationally, they have been sold as &quot;Penny Racers&quot;. Takara also invented Battle Beasts, the E-kara karaoke microphone, B-Daman, and Beyblade, a product that has achieved high popularity globally. These toys were sold or distributed internationally by Hasbro.

The Dakko-Chan doll was revived in 2001 in a new colorful form. This one had enough features to connote the original product, but divested the traits which brought criticism (for example, the new doll was not always coloured black).

===Software===

Takara developed and published video games, the first being &quot;&quot; based on their own Transformers toys. They also licensed their other properties into video games for example the Famicom title &quot;Lost Word of Jenny&quot; based on their Jenny doll, and &quot;Choro Q&quot; games. Other games published by Takara include &quot;Banana Prince&quot; and &quot;Arabian Nights: Sabaku no Seirei-ō&quot;.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Takara published video games for franchises and manga such as &quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;, &quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&quot;, &quot;Duel Masters&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Mew Mew&quot;. The company ported (adapted) some of the SNK Neo Geo based arcade games including the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; series for the 8 and 16-bit consoles, Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or the Famicom.

Takara with its contract developer Tamsoft also produced the influential 3D fighting series &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot;, and other original games such as &quot;SteamGear Mash&quot;. Takara from 1994–1998 also brought many SNK fighters to the Game Boy in the form of simplified &quot;demakes&quot; called &quot;Nettou&quot;, starting with &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;.

&quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&quot; was released in 2003 as a crossover between Takara, Hudson Soft and Konami. From 2003 Takara also owned the video game developer and publisher Atlus. Some Takara properties were licensed to and published by Atlus. In 2006, after the merger with Tomy, Takara&#x27;s former controlling stake in Atlus was sold to Index Holdings, Takara Tomy&#x27;s major shareholder. Takara-branded product licenses were returned to Takara Tomy&#x27;s consumer software division; the merged company thereafter also produced the games in the Zoids and Naruto series.

===Life entertainment products===
Takara has manufactured several unusual gadgets marketed as &quot;life entertainment products&quot;. An example is BowLingual which aimed to translate the sounds of dogs to human language. The BowLingual was named as one of the best inventions of 2002 by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. See also Yumemi Kobo (dream generator).

===Robots===
In 2005, Takara produced Walkie Bits, a colorful, multi-function miniature robotic turtle. it was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s best invention in a robot category.

=== Miscellaneous ===

In the 1980s, Takara as an OEM also sold Sord M5 home computers.

In 2002, Takara developed and released a real-life, road legal small electric car based on its Choro-Q toys through its new motor subsidiary. However due to low sales these cars were soon axed.

==Company history==
Founded in 1955 by Yasuta Sato, the company adopted the name Takara in 1960. The company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1984.

Despite the big success of Beyblade in 1999, Takara was struggling financially. In July 2000, Konami bought a 22.2% controlling stake in the company. In 2003, Takara purchased Atlus and transferred all its video gaming properties to it. Konami sold its share to Index Corporation in April 2005 and Takara became a subsidiary of Index.

On 13 May 2005, Takara and Tomy announced their merger, with Tomy being the surviving company. It became effective on 1 March 2006. In English, the official name of the merged company is &quot;TOMY Co. Ltd.&quot; while in Japan the legal company name is &quot;K. K. Takara-Tomy&quot; (; ). In deciding upon the merged company&#x27;s new name, &quot;Takara&quot; was used for its international brand recognition and &quot;Tomy&quot; was used because it was a trusted brand of infant and preschool products in Japan. While Japanese commercial law allows wide latitude in translating Japanese corporate names into official English names, the merged company took the unusual step of adopting &quot;TOMY Company, Ltd.&quot; as its official English, while using &quot;K.K. Takara-Tomy&quot; in Japan.

<text>Falerna () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Catanzaro, in the Calabria region of southern Italy. It lies on the A3 motorway.

There are two sections of the city. Falerna, the oldest section, lies atop a set of cliffs. Falerna Marina is situated on the seashore and boasts a fine beach and several hotels. Castiglione Marittimo is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the Falerna municipality; it is a former Norman outpost.

Many of Falerna&#x27;s inhabitants emigrated to the United States, in particular western Pennsylvania, and a few have returned to their home town in retirement. Older residents speak a distinct dialect of Italian known as Falernese. It is dying out as media and schools continue to standardize the Italian language throughout the nation.

<doc id="1198586" wikidata="Q7439381" url="?curid=1198586" title="Scud Mountain Boys">
<text>Scud Mountain Boys are an American alternative country band. Formed in 1991 in Northampton, Massachusetts, it comprised Joe Pernice, Stephen Desaulniers, Bruce Tull and Tom Shea. Stephen Desaulniers left the band and was replaced by Frank Padellaro in October 1996.

The band at first was known as the Scuds, and their early work was influenced by electric rock. However, they sat round Tull&#x27;s kitchen table every night and played acoustic country tunes, and soon decided that they enjoyed this style more. This culminated in the Scud Mountain Boys bringing the table to a concert and playing while sitting down, a move which was enthusiastically welcomed.

The band released three albums before disbanding in 1997: &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; (1995), &quot;Pine Box&quot; (1995) and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; (1996). &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was their debut on the Sub Pop label, and upon signing they negotiated for the re-release of their first two albums. &quot;The Early Year&quot; was released in 1997 and contained slightly reordered versions of &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; and &quot;Pine Box&quot; on two CDs.

Pernice, Shea and Desaulniers reunited for an impromptu performance in Cambridge in August 2011. The band announced plans for a full reunion of the original lineup in January 2012 and social networking sites confirmed involvement of Pernice, Desaulniers, Tull and Shea for the shows.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Do You Love the Sun&quot; was released in 2013 featuring all original members (Pernice, Desaulniers, Tull and Shea) with Padellaro as producer and recording engineer. &quot;The Early Year&quot; compilation was also re-released the same year on One Little Indian Records.

Pernice, the group&#x27;s main songwriter, later went on to form the more pop/rock-influenced band Pernice Brothers.

<text>The Chinese Taipei national football team () represents Taiwan (The Republic of China) in international football and is controlled by the Chinese Taipei Football Association. Despite never qualifying for the FIFA World Cup, Chinese Taipei, then known as Republic of China, reached the semi-finals of the 1960 and 1968 AFC Asian Cups, finishing third in the former. The side also won gold at the 1954 and 1958 Asian Games, although the players in the team originated from British Hong Kong.

==History==

=== AFC Asian Cup debut and conflicts (1924–1989) ===
The Chinese Taipei Football Association (CTFA) was founded in Mainland China as the China Football Association (CFA) in 1924 and relocated to Taiwan in 1949 at the end of the Chinese Civil War. The country joined FIFA in 1954, renaming to &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; in 1982.

Chinese Taipei&#x27;s greatest success came when they finished third at the AFC Asian Cup in 1960. The team also qualified for 1960 Summer Olympics. However, the players in the team originally came from Hong Kong, despite the Hong Kong national football team not being one of the best in Asia.

In 1970, an agreement was reached by the Chinese Taipei Football Association and the Hong Kong Football Association to the effect that Hong Kong footballers were no longer eligible to play for Taiwan. Since then, Chinese Taipei has not qualified for any FIFA World Cup and AFC Asian Cup competitions.

==== Oceania representatives ====
Due to the political conflict with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (China PR), Taiwan (Republic of China) had to change their name and Olympics design to &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; after Chinese Taipei had been expelled from Asian Football Federation and Asian Games. Chinese Taipei was part of the Oceania Football Confederation from 1975 to 1989.

=== Return to AFC (1989–present) ===
Chinese Taipei was then re-admitted back to the Asian Football Federation in 1989 and Olympic Council of Asia in 1990. 

Chinese Taipei reached their highest FIFA World Ranking of 121st in July 2018, under the guidance of renowned English coach, Gary White. Since his arrival in the autumn of 2017, White&#x27;s strategies aimed not only to improve the national team, but also the standards of football on the island. An extended scouting operation looking for talents of Taiwanese heritage from abroad was also part of his plans. The cast proved to be successful when players such as Tim Chow, Will Donkin and Emilio Estevez were tapped in for the national team.

In December 2017, Chinese Taipei hosted the CTFA International Tournament, an A-level competition that also included Laos, the Philippines and Timor-Leste. It was created to test the country&#x27;s team in preparation for international friendlies and tournaments in future years. Chinese Taipei won all of their three games, winning the mini-tournament and their first official international trophy in 55 years. Thanks to the four goals he scored (two of which in the final match against Laos), striker Li Mao was deemed as the competition&#x27;s top scorer.

White led a successful period for the Chinese Taipei, including winning 7 FIFA international games in a row. Charged with taking Taiwan to their first AFC Asian Cup since 1968, White had taken over the guide of the national team halfway through the qualification campaign: eventually, he brought them to the third round of the qualifiers, missing a spot to the tournament (in favour of Bahrain and Turkmenistan) by just one point. White was then offered a contract by the Hong Kong national team and left his role in Taiwan in September 2018.

Following the Englishman&#x27;s departure, progress started to plummet during the following year. Vom Ca-nhum, employed as a caretaker manager while he was guiding the Chinese Taipei U19 squad, was unable to qualify his side to the final round of the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (even though they won their match against Mongolia). Then, another Englishman, Louis Lancaster, who previously assisted Gary White during his time on the island, was appointed as the main coach to take his first senior management position. However, things got even worse for the Chinese Taipei: in 2019, the team won just one out of the nine matches they played (a 2–0 win in a friendly against Hong Kong), and they were prematurely eliminated from the continental qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, losing all of their first five games and getting thrashed by Australia (1–7), Kuwait (9–0) and Jordan (5–0). Following the shocking results in the first phase of the qualifiers, Lancaster was sacked in December 2019, and the federation soon decided to hire Vom Ca-nhum again, this time on a full basis, as he was one of the few coaches on the island to have already gained an AFC Pro A coaching license.

In October 2023, Chinese Taipei participated in the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, winning against Timor-Leste 7–0 on aggregate which saw them advancing to the second round, being placed in Group D alongside Oman, Kyrgyzstan, and Malaysia.

=== Kit ===
As of January 2023, the official kit supplier is local Taiwanese sports brand Entes.

=== Stadium ===
Chinese Taipei played their home matches at the Kaohsiung National Stadium which is able to hold up to 55,000 seating capacity. The stadium, designed by Japanese architect Toyo Ito, makes use of 1 MW of solar cells to provide most of its power needs. The stadium&#x27;s semi spiral-shaped, like a dragon, is the first stadium in the world to provide power using solar power technology. The solar panels covering the vast external face of the stadium are able to generate most of the power required for its own operation, as well as additional power that can be sent to the grid.

Chinese Taipei used to play their match at the 20,000 capacity stadium Taipei Municipal Stadium which as of now, will be second in line to host the national team matches. On 3 July 2011, the stadium recorded its highest attendance for a football game when Chinese Taipei hosted Malaysia in the first round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification second leg match, when 15,335 spectators attended the game.

<text>is a toyline by Takara Toys launched in 1980. It consisted of transforming vehicles and robots piloted by miniature, magnet-shoed figures spun off from the prior Microman toy line.

The toys in the 1980 line were designed by future &quot;Macross&quot; designers Shoji Kawamori and Kazutaka Miyatake (both contracted from Studio Nue), who designed the mecha and the figures respectively. Unlike Microman, which featured &quot;full-scale&quot; toys of its 10-centimeter-tall alien cyborgs, the figures in Diaclone represented full-sized human (and enemy alien Waruder) pilots, and were in approximately 1/60 scale. 
In 1982, the line later featured the Car-Robots set of transforming robot toys, invented by Ōno Kōjin with some initial designs by Kawamori and others. While the original series featured fanciful robots and vehicles, Car-Robots added the feature of the robots being able to disguise themselves as various late 20th century-era contemporary vehicles. In 1984, Hasbro licensed the Car-Robots toyline along with the Microman&#x27;s Micro Change toyline from Takara and merged the two series of toys to create the Transformers. Most of the original Autobot vehicle-based characters came from the Car-Robots set of Diaclone robots. Other Transformers characters that came from the Diaclone line included the Dinobots, Insecticons (from the enemy Waruder toys), the Jumpstarters, the mail-order exclusive Powerdashers and Omnibots, the Decepticon planes (originally from two &quot;JetRobo&quot; toys, produced in the colors of future Decepticons Starscream and Thundercracker) and the Constructicons, who also came from the Car-Robots set. The Constructicons came from near the end of the series, at which point Takara was starting to abandon the Inch-Man pilot figures and being limited to the 1/60 scale. The six TrainRobo were also produced in the same sub-line as the Constructicons, but would only become Transformers (as the Trainbots) in Japan&#x27;s 1987 line.

Takara eventually discontinued the Diaclone and Microman toylines in 1985 in favor of the Transformers rebranding. Takara has since revived the franchise, however; first announced at Tokyo Toy Show 2015, the first proper figure of the new &quot;Diaclone&quot; line was revealed at Wonder Festival of 2015. The BotCon storyline for 2015 also features several concepts from the Diaclone series, and several figures were based on Diaclone characters.

<text>Jolie Holland (born September 11, 1975) is an American singer and performer who combines elements of folk, traditional, experimental, and rock.

==Career==
Growing up in her birthplace of Houston, Texas, Holland left in 1994, moving to Austin, New Orleans, and San Francisco before ending up in Vancouver, Canada, where she was one of the founding members of The Be Good Tanyas. Holland left the band before the release of their debut album, &quot;Blue Horse&quot;, on which she appears prominently. She returned to San Francisco, where she recorded her first album, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Catalpa&quot;. Originally self-released, the album was later picked up and re-released by ANTI-. In 2004 she released her first album for ANTI-, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Escondida&quot;. ANTI- labelmates Tom Waits and Sage Francis are both outspoken fans of Holland&#x27;s: Waits nominated her for the Shortlist music prize, while Francis has said that &quot;Escondida&quot; was his most listened to album of 2005.

As well as releasing another four solo albums for ANTI- and touring globally, Holland has performed a number of collaborations with other artists, including with fan Sage Francis (on his album &quot;Human the Death Dance)&quot; and Booker T. (with whom she recorded &quot;What A Wonderful World&quot; in 2007). In 2016, she reunited with Be Good Tanyas bandmate Samantha Parton and they began touring as a duo, releasing the jointly-credited album &quot;Wildflower Blues&quot;, on Cinquefoil Records, in 2017 and embarking on a joint tour through 2018.

<text>The Blue Max is a 1966 WW I film directed by John Guillermin and starring George Peppard, James Mason, Ursula Andress, Karl Michael Vogler, and Jeremy Kemp. The film was made in DeLuxe Color and was one of the last movies filmed in CinemaScope. It was filmed entirely in Ireland, and included numerous location scenes shot in Dublin, Wicklow and Cork. The plot is about a German fighter pilot on the Western Front during World War I. The screenplay was written by David Pursall, Jack Seddon, and Gerald Hanley, based on the novel of the same name by Jack D. Hunter as adapted by Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina.

In contrast to films that romanticize the flying aces of the Great War, &quot;The Blue Max&quot; depicts the protagonist as a man who appears to have no regard for anyone but himself. Set against the realities of modern warfare, the film also explores the decline of chivalry and the advent of total war.

==Plot==

German Corporal Bruno Stachel leaves the fighting in the trenches to become a fighter pilot in the German Army Air Service. In spring 1918, he sets his sights on winning Germany&#x27;s highest medal for valour, the &quot;Blue Max&quot;, for which he must shoot down 20 aircraft.

Of modest origins (his father ran a small hotel), Leutnant Bruno Stachel sets out to prove himself. Oberleutnant Willi von Klugemann resents having a commoner as his rival. Their commanding officer, Hauptmann Otto Heidemann, is an aristocratic officer whose belief in chivalry and the laws and customs of war conflict with Stachel&#x27;s disregard for them.

On his first mission, Stachel shoots down a British S.E.5, but does not receive credit for it because there were no witnesses. Stachel searches the countryside for the wreckage, which gives the impression that he cares more about himself than the death of his wingman.

Soon afterward, he attacks an Allied two-man observation aircraft and incapacitates the rear gunner. Instead of downing the defenseless aircraft, he signals the pilot to fly to the German base. As they near the airfield, the rear gunner revives and reaches for his machine-gun, unseen by the observers on the ground. Stachel is forced to shoot the aircraft down. A disgusted Heidemann believes that Stachel has committed a war crime just for a confirmed kill.

The incident brings Stachel to the attention of Generaloberst Count von Klugemann, Willi&#x27;s uncle. When the general visits the base, he meets Stachel. As Stachel is a commoner, the general sees great propaganda value in him. Meanwhile, Kaeti, the general&#x27;s wife, is carrying on a discreet affair with her husband&#x27;s nephew.

Soon afterward, Stachel is shot down after rescuing a red Fokker Dr.I from two British fighters. When he returns to the airfield, he is stunned when he is introduced to the man he saved: Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. Richthofen offers Stachel a place in his squadron. Stachel declines, explaining his desire to &quot;prove himself&quot; with his current squadron.

With Stachel temporarily grounded by a minor injury, General von Klugemann orders him to Berlin to help shore up the crumbling public morale. The general invites him to dinner. Later, Stachel and Kaeti have sex.

Soon afterward, Stachel and Willi volunteer to escort a reconnaissance aircraft. When British fighters attack, Stachel&#x27;s guns jam, but Willi downs three enemy planes. While returning to base, Willi challenges Stachel to a flying contest, flying under a railway viaduct. Willi clips the top of a tower and crashes. When Stachel reports his death, Heidemann assumes that the verified victories were Willi&#x27;s. Stachel impulsively claims them, even though he fired only 40 bullets before his guns jammed. Outraged, Heidemann officially accuses him of lying, but the Air Service backs Stachel. Later, when he sleeps with Kaeti again, he admits he lied.

During a strafing mission covering the retreat of the German Army, Stachel disobeys orders and engages enemy fighters. The rest of the squadron follows him. Later, Heidemann confronts him because half his pilots were killed in the ensuing dogfight. Stachel does not care. He has shot down enough aircraft, even without Willi&#x27;s kills, to qualify for the Blue Max. Enraged, Heidemann submits a report recommending a court-martial. Both men are ordered to Berlin. There, von Klugemann tells Heidemann that Stachel is to receive the Blue Max because the people need a hero. The general orders Heidemann to withdraw his report. Rather than do that, Heidemann resigns his command and accepts a desk job.

Later that evening, Kaeti visits Stachel and suggests they flee to neutral Switzerland, since defeat is inevitable. Stachel refuses.

The next day, Stachel is awarded the Blue Max by the Crown Prince in a well-publicised ceremony. Field Marshal von Lenndorf telephones von Klugermann to order him to stop the ceremony since an investigation has been opened into Stachel&#x27;s claim. The general asks how the field marshal found out about that. He turns to his wife and realises that she is responsible. When Heidemann reports that the new monoplane that he has just test-flown is a &quot;death trap&quot; with weak struts, von Klugemann sees a way out and tells Stachel, &quot;Let&#x27;s see some real flying&quot;. Stachel&#x27;s aerobatics causes the aircraft to break up and crash.

==Cast==

Cast notes:
The casting of George Peppard in the mainly international ensemble cast was considered a &quot;safe&quot; choice, as he was establishing a reputation for leading roles in action films. Although youthful looking, at 37 years of age, he was much older than the Stachel depicted in the novel. Peppard wanted to create an &quot;authentic&quot; performance and learned to fly, earned a private pilot&#x27;s license and did some of his own flying in the film, although stunt pilot Derek Piggott was at the controls for the under-the-bridge scene.

==Novel==
Jack Hunter&#x27;s debut novel was published in 1964. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;entertaining&quot;.

The novel was optioned by 20th Century Fox, which in October 1964 assigned Ben Barzman and Basilio Franchina to write the script. In December, Fox announced that it would make the film the following summer.

===Compared to film===

The film differs from the book on which it is based both in the plot and the portrayal of the characters. Some of the differences are:

Stachel: The movie portrays Stachel initially as an idealistic, humble and naive man who evolves into someone willing to do whatever it takes to get his way. He is also depicted as being insecure about his lower-class background and desires to prove himself an equal aviator and man to the aristocrats by earning the Blue Max. The vain attempt by Stachel to confirm his first kill occurs only in the film. There is also no confrontation with Heidemann, who takes a swift dislike to Stachel over claiming aircraft that Willi had shot down.

Stachel was played by the 37-year-old George Peppard, in stark contrast to the 19-year-old character of the novel. From the beginning of the novel, Stachel is a deeply troubled alcoholic with a penchant for lying. Obsessed with earning the last of the new Fokker D.VIIs, he kills Willi to obtain it. In the novel, Heidemann exhibits an immediate favouritism toward the newcomer and credits Stachel with his first victories, and Kettering, the squadron adjutant, refuses to comply until Heidemann orders him to do so.

At the end of the novel, Heidemann reveals that he has been secretly boosting Stachel&#x27;s achievements as part of an experiment in publicity management. Stachel earns his Blue Max not from 20 victories but by destroying three aircraft and capturing one after Heidemann&#x27;s guns jam. (Stachel is so drunk that he cannot even recall the engagement.) He is also honoured for saving the life of a French girl who falls into a river. Stachel does not die in the book and in fact meets the future commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, Hauptmann Hermann Göring. Stachel marries Kaeti von Klugermann after the death of Graf von Klugermann, as is noted at the beginning of &quot;The Blood Order&quot;, the second book in Jack Hunter&#x27;s Stachel series.

Hauptmann Heidemann: Heidemann&#x27;s deep longing to be with his wife and her growing depression over his absence are more subtle in the movie than in the book. In the novel, Heidemann does not accuse Stachel of brutality in the shooting down of the British aircraft over their airfield. He regards Stachel as the best pilot in the Jasta after himself and has already planned to assign Stachel one of the new Fokker D.VIIs. In the novel, Heidemann, not General von Klugermann, is the one who recognises the propaganda value of building Stachel up into a hero and uses that as a means to get himself reassigned to Berlin to be near his wife.

Willi von Klugermann: Willi is described as a &quot;fat aristocrat&quot; in the book who has only one victory more than Stachel. In the film, Willi is leaner and more arrogant and competitive and earns a Blue Max shortly after Stachel&#x27;s arrival. In the book, Willi regards Stachel as a close friend, and his affair with Kaeti is revealed only after his death when Stachel reads his journal. Unlike the movie, they are never rivals for her affection. In the novel, Willi is murdered by Stachel to obtain the last of the five new Fokker D VIIs allotted to the squadron. In the movie, Willi is accidentally killed in an aerial competition with Stachel over who is the better pilot.

General von Klugermann: In the movie, the count is a career General-Oberst in the German Army. In the novel, his title is Graf, and he is a famous surgeon who has researched alcoholism and other addictions. Unlike the film, the Graf and the Gräfin do not have an open marriage. In the film, General von Klugermann recognises the social turmoil erupting in Germany and presents Stachel as a lower-class hero. Doctor von Klugermann, an aristocrat, recognises the unfair nature of Germany&#x27;s class system and disapproves of it but makes no effort at change.

Käti von Klugermann: Käti&#x27;s character in the book and film are similar. The Gräfin comes from the lower classes but relishes her status and wealth. Both characters deftly use sexuality to get what they want. In the book, while she is drunk, Stachel extorts money from Käti with his knowledge of her affair with Willi. Later, she blackmails Stachel to marry her by threatening to reveal his murder of Willi and two British pilots. In the film, she proposes for Stachel to run away with her to Switzerland, which he refuses. For that slight, she exposes Stachel&#x27;s lies. Her husband, the General, then sends Stachel to his death in an unstable aircraft to preserve the honour of the officer corps.

Elfi Heidemann: In both the novel and the film, Elfi is a nurse stationed in Berlin. In the book, Elfi is an alcoholic who overcomes her addiction with the assistance of Doctor von Klugermann. Stachel recognises Elfi as his kindred spirit, and after Heidemann&#x27;s death, seeks to form a relationship with her. Käti literally stops him at Elfi&#x27;s door, which forces Stachel to marry her instead. Stachel ruefully accepts his fate to return to Käti and alcoholism.

Corporal Rupp: Rupp has only a minor role in the movie. In the novel, he is an &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; and thoroughly distasteful character, and Stachel describes him as &quot;a pig of a man&quot;. He earns extra money by smuggling cheap booze to Stachel and by using one of the squadron&#x27;s reconnaissance cameras to take pornographic pictures for Kettering&#x27;s extensive collection of erotica. In the end, it is Rupp who provides Kaeti with evidence that implicates Stachel in Willi&#x27;s murder.

Conclusion: In the movie, Heidemann flies the monoplane first and determines that it is a &quot;death trap&quot; because the struts are too weak for the wing loading. General von Klugermann then sends Stachel to his death to shield the German Officer Corps from the shame of Stachel&#x27;s false claim of two victories. In the novel, it is Stachel who tries out the new monoplane, finds the defect and then allows Heidemann to fly the aircraft. Before Heidemann takes off, Stachel tries to stop him to save his life, but Heidemann continues and dies. Hunter&#x27;s novel ends with Stachel meeting a young Hermann Göring, who has assumed command of the vaunted &quot;Flying Circus&quot; after the death of its commander, Manfred von Richthofen.

==Production==
George Peppard&#x27;s casting was announced in April 1965.

The job of directing was given to John Guillermin, who had impressed Fox&#x27;s studio head, Darryl F Zanuck, with two lower budgeted films he made for Fox.

The film was shot in Ireland, at Bray, County Wicklow&#x27;s Ardmore Studios. The budget was originally $3 million.

Fox spent $250,000 on building nine war planes.

Peppard learned to fly for the film and later called working with Guillermin &quot;the most exciting creative experience I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

Director of photography Douglas Slocombe was hospitalized for three weeks with an injured back. Elmo Williams said Guillermin was &quot;indifferent to people getting hurt as long as he got realistic action...a hard-working, overly critical man whom the crew disliked.&quot;

===Stunt flying===
The majority of the aircraft used in the film were converted Tiger Moths and Stampe SV.4s. Two Pfalz D.IIIs were produced (by two separate companies) for the film, along with three Fokker D.VIIs and two Fokker Dr.I triplanes. Other German aircraft were represented by repainted Tiger Moths and Stampes. Two SE 5 flying replicas were made by the Miles Aircraft company at Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex, England. Other British aircraft were mocked-up trainers made into British S.E.5s. The German lozenge camouflage was not universal to all units at the time the story takes place (Spring 1918), but, in the film, aircraft of all German units are shown in this scheme.

The Fokker Dr.I triplanes were purpose-built replicas. The Tiger Moth silhouette was more appropriate to British aircraft of the period, such as the S.E.5a (one of which Stachel shoots down during his first mission) and presents a good general impression of actual contemporary aircraft.

The &quot;death-trap&quot; monoplane at the end of the film, known as the &quot;Adler&quot; (German for eagle) in the novel, may have been inspired by the Fokker E.V, which was a late-war monoplane design which did indeed rapidly gather a reputation for poor construction of the wing, resulting in several crashes before being modified and re-designated the Fokker D.VIII. In the film it is portrayed by Patrick Lindsay&#x27;s Morane 230 Parasol trainer, with a faired-over front seat to simulate a monoplane fighter visually.

The depictions of aerial combat in the film are particularly realistic. The aircraft ground scenes were shot at Weston Aerodrome near Dublin (which should not be confused with RAF Weston-on-the-Green, England).

Pilots from the Irish Air Corps helped recreate the live dog-fight scenes, supported by number of civilians, including former Air Transport Auxiliary pilot Joan Hughes, who flew one of the Pfalz replicas, Charles Boddington and Derek Piggott. Piggott was the only pilot willing to fly beneath the spans of a bridge. Taking the role of both German pilots and with multiple takes from contrasting camera angles, he ended up flying 15 times under the wide span of the Carrickabrack Railway Viaduct in Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland, and 17 times under the narrower span. The two Fokker Dr.I triplane replicas had about of clearance on each side when passing through the narrower span. He was able to fly through the arch reliably by aligning two scaffolding poles, one in the river and one on the far bank. Just before the scenes of flying beneath the bridge, one of the Triplanes executes what could be considered a near-perfect barrel roll as seen from aft of the two Dr.Is used for the scene. Off screen, actor George Peppard flew one of the Pfalz used in the movie.

The director had placed a flock of sheep next to the bridge so that they would scatter as the aircraft approached to show that the stunt was real and not simulated with models. However, by later takes, the sheep had become accustomed to the aircraft, and had to be scared by the shepherd instead. In the printed take, the sheep continued to graze, creating a continuity error which can be seen in the finished film.

The entire collection of aircraft, uniforms and supporting equipment was purchased from 20th Century Fox by ex-Royal Canadian Air Force pilot Lynn Garrison. He kept the collection together in Ireland under his company, Blue Max Aviation, Ltd. Over the following years they played a part in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win &#x27;Em All&quot;, &quot;Darling Lili&quot;, &quot;Zeppelin&quot;, &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot;, and various television commercials, including a classic Ridley Scott production promoting Opel&#x27;s limited edition &quot;Blue Max.&quot; Both of the Pfalz replicas and one Fokker D.VII now belong to New Zealand film director Peter Jackson&#x27;s 1914–18 Trust, with the Viv Bellamy-designed Pfalz now being on display at the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre in New Zealand. All three aircraft are kept in fully airworthy condition. Another of the Fokker D.VII&#x27;s is on display at the Southern Museum of Flight in Birmingham, Alabama.

===Locations===
The scenes where the Germans come into the French village were filmed on Calary Bog in County Wicklow, Ireland. For many weeks, the building of the village attracted the locals to watch it coming up. Then it was bombed and made to look destroyed. It was a local tourist attraction for a long time after the film had wrapped.

The Berlin scenes were shot in Dublin. Christ Church Cathedral and Leinster House, the seat of the Oireachtas, the Irish national parliament, are easily recognisable in the background of many scenes and Trinity College served as the army headquarters where von Klugermann&#x27;s office is located.

Many of the flying scenes were shot at Weston Aerodrome (EIWT) near Lucan, Ireland, about 10 miles west of Dublin hence the name confusion with Weston-on-the-Green. Today there is a restaurant named after the movie at the Aerodrome. The final scene where Stachel meets his fate was filmed at Baldonnel, the Irish Air Corps&#x27; main base. The hangars seen in the movie were built for the Royal Air Force in 1918.

The Carrickabrack Viaduct in Fermoy, County Cork was used for the scenes where Stachel and Von Klugermann flew several times under the railway bridge. The view from the 19th century railway bridge which spans the River Blackwater is spectacular and it was one of the reasons the producers of The Blue Max chose it as one of the locations for the film.

===Historical accuracy===
In an article entitled &quot;About &quot;The Blue Max&quot; the author, Jack D. Hunter, wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;On the day of our arrival at the Bray Studios, we were shown to canvas director’s chairs with our names on the back and treated to rushes of some key action sequences. And I was literally left speechless when I saw Fokker D-7s with inverted engines and 1916-style insignia, Dr-1s with radial engines and smoke canisters on their landing gear struts, machine-guns that looked like Space Cadet props spouting flame without benefit of ammo tracks, every pilot wearing an Uhlan uniform and Battle of Britain style goggles, Gypsy Moths pretending to be Albatros D-3s, a Stampe presented as an RE-8—the anachronisms and goofs compounded. When I asked Delang about it later, he merely shrugged, rolled his eyes, and sighed resignedly. When I challenged the art director on something so glaring as a D-7 with curve-sided crosses, he shrugged, too. &quot;That kind of cross photographs better,&quot; he said. Ah, but how about those machine-guns with no ammo feed tracks? Another shrug. &quot;No big deal. People just watch the muzzle flashes.&quot;

So much for the definitive World War I aviation movie.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Music==
The producers chose Jerry Goldsmith to compose the score after offering the job to Ron Goodwin, who was working on another score. With Goldsmith, they requested a Germanic composition. Goldsmith was even introduced to the project with scenes incorporating a &quot;temp track&quot; from Richard Strauss&#x27;s Also sprach Zarathustra. Goldsmith said of this experience &quot;I admit it worked fairly well but my first reaction was to get up and walk away from the job. Once you&#x27;ve heard music like that with the picture, it makes your own scoring more difficult to arrive at.&quot;

Goldsmith used a large orchestra, some cues requiring over 100 musicians, with large brass and percussion sections as well as a wind machine. On 4 April 1966, he conducted the soundtrack with the National Philharmonic Orchestra led by Sidney Sax at Shepperton Studios in London. These recordings were released on LP by Mainstream Records in 1966, and re-released on LP by Citadel Records in 1976. The soundtrack was released on CD by Varèse Sarabande in 1985 and by Sony in 1995 (with seven cues of source music from the movie arranged by Arthur Morton). The score was once again released, this time complete and in correct film order with accurate track listings, by speciality-label Intrada in 2010.
On 4 March 2014, LaLaLand Records reissued the score on a 2-disc set, including all source music and alternatives. Mike Matessino performed the restoration and remastering, making this the definitive release of this score, with vastly improved sound.

André Previn chose an extended passacaglia from the score to perform on his television program &quot;Previn and the Pittsburgh&quot; in 1978 on the episode &quot;Music that Made the Movies&quot;.

Five tracks of music from the film (&quot;Overture&quot;, &quot;First Flight&quot;, &quot;The Bridge&quot;, &quot;The Attack&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot;) were recorded on 11 March 1987, at Walthamstow Assembly Hall, London, and are incorporated as Tracks 1–5 into the CD, &quot;Goldsmith Conducts Goldsmith&quot;, played by the Philharmonia Orchestra and subsequently released by Silva Screen Records in 2002 (FILMCD336), though it had been originally released in 1989 by the Decca Record Co. Ltd./Filmtrax plc.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Although &quot;The Blue Max&quot; was seen as a quasi-historical account, some critics decried what they considered an intrusive sub-plot tying a World War I story into the &quot;modern theme of the corruption of the military-industrial complex.&quot; Even though the music and the flying scenes were considered the film&#x27;s redemption, some aviation observers criticised what they thought was a wooden characterisation by Peppard&#x27;s performance of a dog-fighting combat pilot from military aviation&#x27;s heroic age.

Robert Alden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;What is by far the best thing about &#x27;The Blue Max&#x27; ... is that this élan, this glory, is captured on film once again. With the technological improvements of the years, the skies were never bluer or wider, the war in the air or on the ground never more realistic ... The question each filmgoer will have to ask himself is how much of what is bad in &#x27;The Blue Max&#x27; is he willing to take in exchange for what is good. Much of the earthbound drama of this lengthy film is tangled, confusing, clumsy.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a World War I combat drama with some exciting aerial sequences helping to enliven a somewhat grounded, meller (sic) script in which no principal character engenders much sympathy.&quot;

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote of the film that &quot;The aerial dogfights have thrilling impact ... Its fault is that it doesn&#x27;t give one anybody to pull for, so that aside from admiration for the men who fly these flimsy, antiquated crates one&#x27;s sympathies are rarely engaged.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;the flight sequences and the fantastically frail-looking planes run away with the picture ... Director John Guillemin rightly makes the most of Skeets Kelly&#x27;s aerial photography and those fabulous flying crates, but on the ground he misses what might have been an absorbing statement.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;the aerial dogfights are imaginative and lively&quot; and James Mason &quot;is in fine form,&quot; but &quot;the film is padded out with tedious chunks of indoor chat between its set of largely unpleasant characters, filmed flatly in gloomy shades of grey and green for the most part.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 6 critics, with an average rating of 6.1/10.

&quot;Filmink&quot; called it &quot;a sports movie at heart.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Blue Max&quot; was a financial success at the box office, earning $5 million in North American rentals in 1966. It was one of the twelve most popular films at the British box office in 1967.

According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $14,200,000 in rentals to break even and made $16,850,000. By 11 December 1970, it made Fox a profit of $2,830,000. It would be Peppard&#x27;s last big commercial success until &quot;The A Team&quot;.

===Legacy===
Director Peter Jackson listed the film as one of the top six World War I films.

In Yellow Submarine The Blue Meanies second-in-command, Max is named after the tite.

<text>Private Stock Records was a record label that operated from 1974 to 1978.

The label was founded by Larry Uttal after he left Bell Records. The label primarily focused on pop music and had numerous hit records, many of them one-hit wonders, including singles by David Soul of &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; fame (&quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Us&quot;), Starbuck (&quot;Moonlight Feels Right&quot;), Austin Roberts (&quot;Rocky&quot;), Samantha Sang (&quot;Emotion&quot;), Walter Murphy and the Big Apple Band (&quot;A Fifth of Beethoven&quot;), Cyndi Grecco (&quot;Making Our Dreams Come True&quot;, a.k.a. the theme song to &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;) and Frankie Valli (&quot;My Eyes Adored You&quot;, &quot;Swearin&#x27; to God&quot;, &quot;Our Day Will Come&quot;). The label also released Brownsville Station&#x27;s album with the same name, and the singles &quot;The Martian Boogie&quot; and &quot;(Lady) Put the Light on Me&quot; in 1977. Even during 1976 and 1977 Jose Feliciano released two albums on the label, &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot; (produced by Jerry Wexler) and &quot;Angela&quot; (soundtrack of the movie Aaron Loves Angela). More indicative of the label&#x27;s nature, Private Stock issued for the US in 1976 a compilation of Rod Stewart&#x27;s work with Steampacket and the Hoochie Koochie Men culled from mid-1960s live shows in the UK while the singer was transitioning from Mercury Records to Warner Brothers. In the early 1980s a Stray Cats compilation appeared in stores, ostensibly a licensee of Capitol Records but debatable as to whether it was even the same company.

Blondie&#x27;s eponymous debut album—which was not a commercial success at the time—was also originally issued on Private Stock in 1976, as were two final single releases by Junior Campbell. 
Following the demise of Woody Woodmansey&#x27;s U-Boat, singer/songwriter Phil Murray signed to the label in 1978, and released one single, End Of My Time, before moving on to Mickie Most&#x27;s label RAK. 
Singer-songwriter Tom Paxton&#x27;s 1975 album, &quot;Something in My Life&quot; and Rupert Holmes&#x27; fourth album, &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; were also released by the label.
Peter Lemongello released one album and a few singles for Private Stock after his debut &quot;Love &#x27;76.&quot; However, the &quot;Love &#x27;76&quot; album was never released by Private Stock, and none of his recordings for the label charted. 
Gospel/soul singer Cissy Houston (mother of singer Whitney Houston) released two albums on the label- 1977&#x27;s &quot;Cissy Houston&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Think It Over&quot;.

The label closed down when Uttal moved to London; he later returned to New York, where he died in 1993. His son Jai Uttal owned the rights to the catalogue after his father&#x27;s death, after which he sold to 43 North Broadway, LLC around 2016.

<text>The Autostrada A3 is an &quot;autostrada&quot; (Italian for &quot;motorway&quot;) long in Italy located in the region of Campania, which runs from Naples to Salerno. It is a part of the E45 European route. 

Until 2017 the route was much longer, going after Salerno further south until Reggio Calabria; on this year, this section became part of the new Autostrada A2 and of its two spur routes.

==History==

Due to sections not being originally constructed to anywhere near Motorway standard and to the notoriously poor conditions of maintenance, and also to the difficult terrain along some of the route, the motorway has been often taken as a symbol of the backwardness and economical problems of southern Italy. Italian historian Leandra D&#x27;Antone has defined it &quot;a true Italian shame&quot;. The European Union declines to classify the road as a &quot;motorway&quot; due to the decades-long roadwork restrictions on a supposedly modern road and seeks recompense for its financial contributions.

The first stretch of the road to be completed was the Naples-Pompeii section, finished on 22 June 1929. The connection onward to Salerno was completed on 16 July 1961. In 1964 the Italian government decided to build a motorway which connected the rest of Italy to Calabria, so far considered a kind of &quot;Third Island&quot; (together with Sicily and Sardinia), due to the nature of its terrain, which made it problematic to reach the region. The new motorway was built in a total of 8 years, the works being delivered on 13 June 1974.

The road built by 1974 was more similar to a sub-standard freeway (Italian: &quot;strada statale&quot;, &quot;state road&quot;) than to the other &quot;autostrade&quot; (motorways) in Italy. Hard shoulders were absent, curves were often sharp, and in many places merge lanes were absent - the cars entering the motorway instead had to wait at stop signs. By the 1990s the road was severely deteriorated. 

===1997–2017 Renovation===

Queues became a common feature, especially in summer. To solve the situation, the Italian government funded the construction of a new route which would remove the high gradients and sharp turns and enlarge the carriageway. This required the construction of new tunnels and viaducts (among these the viadotto italia the highest in Italy) while keeping the traffic on the current motorway open. The reconstruction works started in 1997 and officially ended in 2016 during a ceremony although works continued until late 2017. The EU antifraud investigation of works undertaken between 2007 and 2010 together with the repayment of over €300m to the EU in July 2012 have delayed completion of the upgrade works even further.

The cost of the upgrade (in August 2013) was projected to reach over €10bn by the time it was eventually completed, then envisaged as 2018. The section from Salerno to Reggio Calabria alone, 442 km long, would cost €10bn with the rest spent on widening/upgrades already completed between Naples and Salerno. €7.443 Bn had been spent up to 2011 on parts of the 442 km section between Salerno and Reggio Calabria.

On 22 December 2016 the Salerno-Reggio Calabria freeway was declared complete, 20 years after the first renovation works started, with the opening of Larìa tunnel in Cosenza. In a ceremony held in Reggio Calabria, prime minister Paolo Gentiloni begged pardon &quot;for the delay&quot; and the road name was changed from &quot;&quot;A3 Salerno-to-Reggio Calabria&quot; to &quot;A2 Autostrada del Mediterraneo&quot;&quot; (Highway of the Mediterranean).

===Construction===

The entire road was constructed as a substandard freeway by the mid-1970s and later an upgrade program from Naples to Reggio Calabria started in the early 1990s. The section with three lanes in each direction has a length of 105 km, between Naples and RA02 which goes towards Potenza. The section from the interchange with the A1 motorway in Naples to the Pompeii exit, built during the 1920s, originated as a local turnpike, and was later retrofitted to motorway standard. 
Many of the junctions along the original A3 route completed in the 1970s had very tight corners and extremely limited deceleration fields; this is especially significant on the now more than 50-year-old Naples-Salerno section, where at some junctions there are stop-signs for traffic entering the motorway. 
Hard shoulders only appeared along the route as part of the post 1990 upgrades, with only occasional emergency bays at infrequent locations on the sections that have not been upgraded yet.

The concession of the Northern part was owned by , a company listing in Borsa Italiana and a subsidiary of Autostrade per l&#x27;Italia, which in turn a subsidiary of Atlantia.
The southern segment (Salerno-Reggio Calabria) is toll-free and is maintained by ANAS, the state agency for public routes. Located in a mountainous area, it is prone to very high levels of traffic (especially at the start and at the end of holiday periods).

===Upgrade progress===
Starting in 1997 the motorway underwent heavy modernisation, in many cases a completely new parallel motorway was built alongside the original A3 and involved in most cases a complete rebuilding or replacement of the road where the alignment was retained. By August 2014, works on 391 km of the road (88%) were completed. 16 more km of rebuilding/modernization was then due to be completed. A number of new junctions were also to be constructed, in some cases to service certain towns with no direct access at present. In May 2015 then prime minister Renzi indicated that the upgrade programme would be terminated by 2016.

By March 2016 68 km remained to be done. Plans to upgrade 58 km were abandoned and changed from Motorway Construction projects to &quot;Maintenance&quot; Maintenance will involve pavement and structural renewal and is projected to cost €1bn between 2016 and 2021 instead of the €3bn that ANAS projected as the cost of fully upgrading the 3 remaining sections. These total 58 km of the new length of 435 km from Salerno to Campo Calabro and do not include the final 10 km from Campo Calabro to Reggio Calabria which remains as constructed in the 1970s. Also abandoned were a number of planned junctions. The motorway standard road will terminate at Campo Calabro approximately 10 km to the north of Reggio Calabria, and the remaining 10 km of old A3 into Reggio Calabria will not be upgraded to full motorway standards.

==Major Cities==
A3 goes through many cities, that are Salerno, Nocera Inferiore, Pompei, Torre Annunziata, Torre del Greco, Ercolano, Pompei, Portici, San Giorgio a Cremano, and Naples.

<text>Priority Records is an American distribution company and record label known for artists including N.W.A, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy-E, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Silkk the Shocker, Jay-Z, Paris, Mack 10, 504 Boyz, Brotha Lynch Hung, C-Murder, Mia X, Westside Connection, and Ice-T. It also distributed hip hop record labels including Death Row Records, Hoo-Bangin&#x27; Records, No Limit Records, Posthuman Records, Rap-A-Lot Records, Rawkus Records, Roc-A-Fella Records, Ruthless Records Duck Down Records, and Wu-Tang Records. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;few record labels were as important to the rise of West Coast hip hop as Priority Records&quot;.

== Company history ==
=== Beginnings (1985–1996) ===
The Los Angeles-based company (with no ties or relations to a previous Priority Records label that was a subsidiary of what was then CBS Records) was formed in 1985 by three former K-tel executives: Bryan Turner, Mark Cerami and Steve Drath. Initial funding was provided by R-tek, a company headed by former K-tel board members: Ray and Harold Kives, and their company took an initial 50% ownership in Priority. Priority bought out the R-tek interest in 1987.

Its first success came with novelty act the California Raisins. To support early operations, Priority Records licensed repertoire from others and released compilation albums using archive recordings while developing its own artist roster. Priority Records achieved success as an independent label by developing a precedent-setting &quot;street-based&quot; formula of underground marketing which bypassed mainstream radio. This approach allowed Priority to sell millions of records without entering into the fiercely competitive major label battles over radio airplay. Priority&#x27;s strategic marketing team was developed by Vice President Alyssa Pisano, who led Priority&#x27;s Marketing and Creative Services Department between 1987 and 1996. Priority&#x27;s roster featured numerous gold, platinum and multi-platinum artists, including N.W.A, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy-E, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Silkk the Shocker, Jay-Z, Paris, Mack 10, 504 Boyz, Brotha Lynch Hung C-Murder, Mia X, Westside Connection, No Limit and Ice-T.

Priority distributed rapper Jay-Z&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, in June 1996 with Jay-Z&#x27;s company Roc-A-Fella Records. The album was a critical success, but a minor success upon release, selling 43,000 copies in its first week and 420,000 copies altogether. It was ultimately certified Platinum by the RIAA. &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was Roc-A-Fella and Jay-Z&#x27;s only album with Priority Records.

=== EMI acquisition (1996–2004) ===
In the early 1990s, the label struck up a distribution deal with EMI, while continuing to operate independently. EMI bought a 50% stake in Priority in 1996, and the remainder in 1998.

In 1997, Priority released the I&#x27;m Bout It soundtrack by No Limit Records. The album was a critical and commercial success, debuting and peaking in the top 5 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. It sold 300,000 copies in its first week, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

In 1999, Priority and No Limit Silkk the Shocker&#x27;s January 1999 release, &quot;Made Man&quot;, which debuted and peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

Despite EMI&#x27;s full ownership, Priority continued to be an independently managed company until 2001, when its operations were merged into EMI&#x27;s major U.S. subsidiary, Capitol Records. Priority was absorbed into Capitol Records in 2004 and ceased operations.

=== Relaunch (2006–2013) ===
In late 2006, EMI revived Priority Records, and it was supposed to start releasing new records again but never did except for a couple compilation and greatest hits albums from the likes of N.W.A, Westside Connection, Mack 10, and Ice Cube. In 2009, Snoop Dogg was appointed creative chairman of the label; Priority released Snoop Dogg&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Malice N Wonderland&quot; on December 8, 2009. In July 2013, Priority was re-launched via a joint venture between Capitol Records and Insurgency Music. Based at the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, the new Priority Records was a producer centric label that focused on a broader array of music genres, including electronic music as well as urban music. The lone release under Priority&#x27;s first relaunch was Snoop Dogg&#x27;s Malice n Wonderland, which was a commercial failure. Following this, Priority remained dormant.

=== Second relaunch (2015–present) ===
In 2015, due to the success of the 2015 American biographical film &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; based on former Priority act N.W.A, Priority Records was relaunched one more time as a distributor. This time the focus was on new acts, including G Perico, Snoh Aalegra and Jonn Hart. In 2018, Priority Records partnered with TuneGO. Priority Records signed TuneGO Artist, Three Guests and distributed their album, &quot;3G&quot;. Priority also signed Massachusetts rap group Bandits The Label and later went on to distribute DtheFlyest debut project &quot;Dope Boy Diaries&quot; which was executive produced by CruufromtheNorth and featured a hit single with rap superstar Lil Baby titled &quot;Fugazi&quot; (2018).

<doc id="1198620" wikidata="Q978692" url="?curid=1198620" title="Satō">
<text>is the most common Japanese surname, representing about 1.5% of Japan&#x27;s population in March 2023. It is often romanized as Sato, Satou or Satoh.

A 2024 study by Hiroshi Yoshida at Tohoku University estimated that if a law requiring spouses to have the same surname is not repealed and the Japanese people do not go extinct due to population decline, then every person in Japan will have the surname Satō by 2531 — legalizing separate surnames for married couples would delay this to .

<text>Positiva Records is a subsidiary of Universal Music Group and concentrates on releasing dance music in the UK. The record label was set up in 1993, by Nick Halkes, who previously ran XL Recordings. Its headquarters are at the Universal UK offices (formerly at EMI offices in Brook Green in West London), where it is the only large dance music label under the EMI banner.

==History==
One of the label&#x27;s first releases was &quot;I Like to Move It&quot; by Reel 2 Real, an alias of dance DJ Erick Morillo, originally released on Strictly Rhythm. Later, the label signed US vocalist Barbara Tucker, who went on to release tracks including &quot;Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Stay Together&quot; (both 1995) and &quot;Stop Playing with My Mind&quot; (2000). Other house releases in this period came from Umboza, the Bucketheads and Judy Cheeks. During the late 1990s, Positiva released several tracks from the emerging trance scene such as Alice Deejay&#x27;s &quot;Better Off Alone&quot; which became a huge hit in Europe and the U.S., as well as DJ Quicksilver&#x27;s &quot;Bellissima&quot;, Ayla&#x27;s eponymously titled &quot;Ayla&quot;, Binary Finary&#x27;s &quot;1998&quot; and BBE&#x27;s &quot;Seven Days and One Week&quot;.

Releases in the 2000s have included the number one hits &quot;Toca&#x27;s Miracle&quot; by Coco Star vs Fragma, &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; by Spiller featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and &quot;Lola&#x27;s Theme&quot; by the Shapeshifters. Other top 10 hits in the same decade include Watergate&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Asia&quot;, &quot;Flashdance&quot; by Deep Dish, Motorcycle&#x27;s &quot;As the Rush Comes&quot;, remixes of The Source feat. Candi Staton&#x27;s &quot;You Got the Love&quot; and &quot;Watch the Sunrise&quot; by Swedish DJ/producer Axwell.

Other artists who have been with the label for many years include Paul van Dyk and the Shapeshifters, although the latter have since left to release tracks via Defected Records and concentrate on running their own Nocturnal Grooves label.

The label has since been resurrected by Universal Music Group as a trading name for Virgin Records and releases from foreign dance acts, such as Armin van Buuren, Avicii, Nicky Romero and Nervo.

<doc id="1198629" wikidata="Q1544006" url="?curid=1198629" title="Aces High (film)">
<text>Aces High is a 1976 war film directed by Jack Gold, starring Malcolm McDowell, Peter Firth, Christopher Plummer and Simon Ward. An Anglo-French production, the film is based on the 1928 play &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; by R. C. Sherriff, with additional material from fighter ace Cecil Lewis&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Sagittarius Rising&quot;. The screenplay was written by Howard Barker.

&quot;Aces High&quot; turns the trench warfare of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; into the aerial battles fought in 1917 by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) above the Western Front. The film covers a week of a squadron where the high death rate puts an enormous strain on the surviving pilots. Many characters and plot lines are loosely based on those of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;: the idealistic new officer who is killed at the end, and whose sister is the girlfriend of his tough but alcoholic commanding officer, the kindly middle-aged second-in-command (known as &quot;Uncle&quot; by the younger officers) who is killed on a dangerous intelligence-gathering mission ordered by the top brass, and the officer whose claims of neuralgia are taken to be cowardice.

==Plot==
In October 1916, fighter ace John Gresham speaks to the senior class at Eton College, which includes Stephen Croft. Gresham had been his house captain at Eton and is his older sister&#x27;s boyfriend. To Croft he is a hero to be emulated. 

A year later, 2nd Lt. Croft, after much careful arranging and maneuvering, arrives as a replacement at the base in northern France where Gresham is commanding officer. Seeing the excitement the young man has about flying with his hero, Captain &quot;Uncle&quot; Sinclair tells Croft he might find Gresham &quot;changed&quot;. 

Gresham is conflicted about having a younger man worship him as a hero as he relies on alcohol to continue being a flying ace, something Croft might report to his older sister back home. In a series of trials by fire, Gresham initiates Croft into the fighter pilot world, shooting down a German fighter on the younger pilot&#x27;s tail. When Croft writes of his admiration for this heroic feat in a letter to his sister, Gresham waylays the letter, purportedly so he can review it. Not able to bring himself actually to open the letter, Sinclair reads it to him.

When Sinclair is killed in a photography mission Croft pilots, Gresham arranges to have him lose his virginity to a young French woman (prostitute) in Amiens. When Croft sneaks back to town the next night to be with her, she is chatting with a French colonel and ignores him.

By the end of the week, Croft shoots down his first plane. He is then suddenly killed in an air-to-air collision with a German aircraft. Back at base, Gresham struggles to write a letter to Croft&#x27;s older sister, informing her of his death.  When the next hopeful group of young replacement pilots enters his office for his review, he sees an apparition of an uninjured, smiling Croft through his office window.  After the image fades, Gresham notes the dirtiness of the window to Bennett, before ordering the replacement pilots to grab their gear.

==Cast==
(Name in brackets for the equivalent character in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;.)
==Production==
===Development===
The idea for the film came from producer Benny Fisz, who had served in the RAF in the Second World War and made such movies as &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;. He pitched the idea of remaking &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; with an air force background to British director Jack Gold, who had just made &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;. Although initially wary of it being an aviation film, Gold agreed after Howard Barker revised the screenplay.

Gold said he was attracted to the film because &quot;That was innocence, extreme youth, marred lives of these pilots who knew they are going to die. And we could show not only chivalry and bravery but also the fear.&quot; &quot;What interests me is human relationships,&quot; said Gold. &quot;&quot;Aces High&quot; has aerial battle scenes but they&#x27;re not just thrown in. It has songs but they&#x27;re not just cue music. They do tell something about the characters.&quot; Barker said Fisz&#x27;s idea had &quot;opened up&quot; Sherriff&#x27;s play. &quot;You can&#x27;t set a film entirely in a dugout.&quot;

The movie was co-financed by EMI Films. Its production was announced in July 1975 by Nat Cohen of EMI, as part of a slate of films worth £6-7 million. (Others included &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads&quot;, a remake of &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Steiner&quot;, &quot;Spanish Fly&quot;, &quot;To the Devil a Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Nat King Cole Story&quot; and &quot;Seven Nights in Japan&quot;. Some of these were not made.)

===Casting===
Peter Firth and Christopher Plummer joined Malcolm McDowell, who agreed to appear in the film because Gold had such a good reputation among actors at the time.

===Filming===
The shooting schedule took seven weeks with one week for rehearsal. Exteriors were shot in Spain and Southern England with principal photography at Booker Airfield, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, as well as St Katharine Docks and Eton College. Interiors were completed at Pinewood Studios. Malcolm McDowell recalls a highlight was when Douglas Bader visited the set.

The production paid close attention to authenticity with First World War era equipment being used throughout the film such as the airfield facilities, barracks and motor transport. The squadron depicted (known as 76 Squadron) is loosely based on 56 Squadron, which flew the S.E.5 that regained Allied air superiority in mid-1917. Some scenes are based on real RFC stories, such as pilots choosing between jumping to their deaths or burning alive in their aircraft (as they were not issued parachutes). The juvenile mess room songs and young pilots &quot;public school&quot; attitudes capture the fatalistic attitudes of the time, when the life expectancy of a new pilot could be measured in weeks.

====Aerial sequences====

Although the film reused some aerial sequences from &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1966) and &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot; (1971), the producers shot their own flight scenes. All British S.E.5s were heavily modified Stampe SV.4s, a Belgian two-seat trainer that first flew in the 1930s. Sinclair&#x27;s plane was a period Avro 504.

German aircraft were all adapted post-WWI aircraft except for a replica Fokker E-III . The reproduction is seen when it is brought down intact and its pilot given a toast by his British counterparts. Production stills show Malcolm McDowell (Gresham) posing with a Bristol M.1C but this particular plane does not appear in the finished film.

Director Jack Gold later recalled &quot;It was very difficult to obtain those planes. Sometimes we used models or archive footage. Action sequences in the air were very difficult to make and they were also very much tied with story. I had great assistant in Derek Cracknell and great specialist for special effects.&quot;

==Reception==
The film was not a success at the box office.&lt;rf name=&quot;five&quot;/&gt; Malcolm McDowell argued this was in part because it had too much action for a psychological drama but not enough action to be a proper action film.
===Critical===
&quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; wrote the film &quot;contains a quarter of young actors whose enormous potential for stardom will, predictably, only be equalled by the inability of British studios to know what to do with it.&quot; &quot;A shrill anti-establishment squawk,&quot; complaiened &quot;The Observer&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a very straight forward epic... if not exactly inspired, is at least handled with great competence and confidence throughout.&quot;

&quot;The Evening Standard&quot; felt the movie was &quot;predictably good in the sky&quot; but when it came to &quot;asking for insight into the hearts and minds of the boy pilots of the Royal Flying Corps, it&#x27;ll be a deep disappointment.&quot;

Film historian Michael Paris saw &quot;Aces High&quot; as another of the period films that attempted to &quot;de-mystologise&quot; warfare. Film archivist and historian Stephen Pendo saw the &quot;good aerial photography by Gerry Fisher&quot; as the strength of a film that played more as &quot;standard fare&quot;.

Howard Barker later said the film&#x27;s &quot;theme reveals in comic clarity the absurdity of producer-power in an artistic enterprise. It involved converting &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; into a flying film. Of course all the power that play possessed — and it’s not a play I like — was instantly dissipated, and you were left with a lot of public schoolboys flying over Surrey.&quot;

&quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;&quot;Journey’s End&quot; didn’t translate to the sky, at least not in this version with these stars... and this director... ; 1938’s &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; is far better.&quot; 
==US Release==
The film was not shown in US cinemas. HBO premiered it in 1979.
==Legacy==
Howard Barker mentioned the film in a 2017 interview, joking &quot;Was there ever a more ill-conceived project?” but adding, &quot;I wouldn’t be in this house if I hadn’t written that. Never made any money out of the theatre.” 

The song &quot;Aces High&quot; by Iron Maiden is titled after and inspired by the film, although takes place during the Second World War, whereas the film takes place in the First World War. Iron Maiden frequently name songs after war films.

The episode of &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; titled &quot;Private Plane&quot;, during the aerial sequence, reuses scenes from &quot;Aces High&quot;.

<text>John Stanly (April 9, 1774 – August 2, 1834) was a Federalist U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1801 and 1803 and again between 1809 and 1811. He was the father of Edward Stanly and rear admiral Fabius Stanly, and the father-in-law of General Walker Keith Armistead.

==Early life==
Stanly, the son of John Wright Stanly, was born in New Bern, North Carolina, and educated by private tutors before attending Princeton University. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799.

==Career==
After practicing law and serving as a clerk and master in equity, Stanly was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1798 and 1799.

In 1800, Stanly was elected as a Federalist to the 7th United States Congress (March 4, 1801 – March 3, 1803); he served again in the 11th Congress (March 4, 1809 – March 3, 1811) before returning to the practice of law. Stanly returned to the state house for several more terms, in 1812–1815, 1818–1819, and 1823–1825. He died in New Bern in 1834 and is buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery. He is also known for killing Richard Dobbs Spaight, a signer of the Constitution, in a famous duel in 1802. Although Spaight&#x27;s family sought to have Stanly charged with murder, he was pardoned by Gov. Benjamin Williams. As a result of the duel, North Carolina passed a strict anti-duelling law prohibiting duelists from holding public office, and listing the duel as a specific crime, as opposed to a common law offense.

==Personal life==
Stanly had at least three sons, Edward, Fabius and Marcus Cicero. His daughter married General Walker Keith Armistead.

==Legacy==
Stanly County, North Carolina was formed in 1841, and named in his honor.

Research by Chris Bramlett indicates that John Stanly had no connection with the area named for him, but that the name was chosen to please state legislators. Bramlett also believed that Stanly&#x27;s father John Wright Stanly was named Stanley and changed the spelling. One theory offered by Bramlett is that the elder Stanly, while on a trip to India during the American Revolution, met a British soldier named Stanley. Since he did not like the idea of being related to a British soldier, Stanly said his name was spelled without an E.

<doc id="1198651" wikidata="Q6325245" url="?curid=1198651" title="V. Viswanatha Menon">
<text>Vadakkoot Viswanatha Menon, also known as Ambadi Viswam (15 January 1927 – 3 May 2019), was an Indian politician and was the former minister in the southern state of Kerala in India. He had also served as a member in the Indian Parliament.

In the early 2000s, Viswanatha Menon distanced himself from the CPI(M) due to difference of opinion on party policies. He contested from Ernakulam constituency to Lok Sabha with support from the Bharatiya Janata Party and a rebel CPI(M) splinter group in 2004 and was defeated by Dr. Sebastian Paul.

== Early life ==
Viswanatha Menon was born in Kochi as the son of Narayana Menon, a lawyer, and Vadakkoot Lakshmikkuttiyamma. His father belonged to Ambadi, a famous Nair family of Cochin.

He was a political activist in his youth, accused in the Communist attack on the Edappally police station. He was a leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala. Starting his career as a student activist in the Indian independence movement in his alma mater Maharaja&#x27;s College, Ernakulam, he became popularly known as Ambadi Viswam among his peers, seniors and near ones.

Menon was one of the popular youth leaders in Kochi at that time, owing to his opinions and actions against the ruling elite. A follower of Mahatma Gandhi since childhood, he was inclined towards communism during his student days due to the influence of prominent personalities around him, including his cousin A. K. Damodaran, former Indian Administrative Service official.

At the last stage of his political career he quit CPM and joined the Bharathiya Janata Party and contested as a BJP Candidate in assembly elections in 2004.

== Career ==
V. Viswanatha Menon was one of the earliest members of the undivided Communist Party of India in Kochi and played an essential role in building its base during the colonial and post-colonial period of the 1940s and early 1950s. Having sacrificed his aristocratic lifestyle at his affluent family, he worked among the party ranks against the exploitation of the oppressed classes.

The caste system left the less fortunate castes never achieving equal treatment. This continuing injustice inspired Menon to adopt Socialism and later on Democracy, as a means of addressing these ills.

He was a two-time Member of Parliament representing CPI and later the CPI(M). He served as Finance Minister in the 1987 E.K. Nayanar-led Left Democratic Front Government. He once held the record of having presented the lengthiest Budget speech in the Kerala Legislative Assembly.

He served as trade union president in FACT for 12 years, and in Indal for 14 years. He also led a Cochin Port union.

During the early 2000s, he distanced himself from the CPI(M) due to difference of opinion on party policies. He contested from Ernakulam constituency to Lok Sabha with support from the Bharatiya Janata Party and a rebel CPI(M) splinter group in 2004 and was defeated by Dr. Sebastian Paul.

<doc id="1198656" wikidata="Q5236289" url="?curid=1198656" title="David Laing (architect)">
<text>David Laing (1774–1856) was a British architect principally known as the architect of the New Custom House in London, which was completed in 1817 and collapsed in 1825. Assisted by a young William Tite, he also rebuilt the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East between 1817 and 1821.
==Life==
David Laing was born in London and baptised in the church of St Dunstan-in-the-East in March 1775. In 1790 he was articled to the architect John Soane. He set up his own architectural practice in 1796, initially designing private houses. in 1801 he published a book of his designs, entitled &quot;Hints for Dwellings, Consisting of Original Designs for Cottages, Farm Houses, Villas, etc.&quot;, which sold well enough to be reprinted several times.

In 1810 he was appointed Surveyor to the Customs, and designed the new customs house at Plymouth. Two years later he was asked to produce plans for a new custom house in London, replacing the old building of 1718. His first suggestions were rejected, so he produced a simpler scheme, for a massive rectangular block. Laing estimated the cost at £209,000, but the contract was won by Miles and Peto, with a tender of only £165,000. During construction, costs escalated, and there were disputes between Laing and the contractors. In 1818 Laing published a book of plans and drawings which included details of the problems he had encountered in laying the foundations of the New Custom House. The foundations proved inadequate: in 1820, cracks appeared in the vault of the king&#x27;s warehouse in the central section of the block, and four years later the facade of the long room above it collapsed, followed by the warehouse vaults themselves and the long room floor. Sir Robert Smirke, called in to investigate, reported that the work paid for had not been done to specification. The facade was rebuilt to Smirke&#x27;s own design with new foundations.

After the collapse of the New Custom House Laing was suspended from his post as Architect &amp; Surveyor of the Board of Customs, and his practice was ruined.

His other works included the rebuilding of St Dunstan-in-the-East, the Corn Market at Colchester and, after his dismissal from the post with the customs, Lexden Park, and the Royal Universal Infirmary for Children, Waterloo Road, London.

<doc id="1198661" wikidata="Q2378658" url="?curid=1198661" title="Fuzion">
<text>Fuzion is a generic role-playing game system created by the collaboration of R. Talsorian Games and Hero Games. The rights to Fuzion are jointly held by Mike Pondsmith of R. Talsorian Games, along with Steve Peterson and Ray Greer of Hero Games. &quot;Fuzion&quot; is a combination of the Interlock System, (used in games like &quot;Mekton&quot; and &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;), and the HERO system (used in &quot;Champions&quot;, &quot;Justice, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Star Hero&quot;, etc.). &quot;Fuzion&quot; is an adaptable system which can be played in any genre and setting imaginable.

&quot;Fuzion&quot; is noted for its anime-genre support, customizable rules flexibility, and being one of the first generic game systems to be released for free over the internet. It is one of the first games to readily allow licensing, albeit not the &quot;hands-off&quot; licensing offered by the Open Gaming License (OGL) that came about some years later. A modified OGL set of rules based on &quot;Fuzion&quot; is published by Gold Rush Games as the &quot;Action! System&quot;.

There are two versions of &quot;Fuzion&quot; that have been published: the simplified Instant Fuzion, and more detailed Total Fuzion (also known as &quot;Primary Fuzion&quot;). A third, Maximum Fuzion, was hinted at in &quot;Fuzion&quot;-based &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot; RPG, but has never been published.

==Making &quot;Fuzion&quot; characters==
&quot;Fuzion&quot; uses a point-based creation method for building characters. This system is similar to both of the parent systems as well as other generic games like &quot;GURPS&quot;.

===Character Points===
&quot;Fuzion&quot; characters are built with &quot;Character Points (CPs)&quot;, also known as Stat Points. Depending on the &quot;power level&quot; of the game, the Referee (or Game Master), assigns players a number of CPs to buy Attribute Stats. Usually, 40 to 50 points are enough for a heroic &quot;action-adventure&quot; setting. Fewer points would be given for low-power games set in a more realistic, &quot;mundane&quot; world. A hundred (or more) points are given for high-powered, superheroic adventures. CPs are used to buy levels in &quot;Primary Stats&quot; which are the basic attribute abilities of the character.

===Option Points and Power Points===
&quot;Option Points (OPs)&quot;, or Campaign Points, are given to characters to buy Character Options. OPs are assigned by the Referee and are usually kept separate from the Character Point pool. The Referee usually gives a pool of as many OPs as he gives CPs. At the player&#x27;s choice, any leftover CPs not used to buy Stats can be traded for OPs at a ratio of 1:5, (1 CP = 5 OP) and vice versa. OPs can also be converted into money to buy Equipment at a ratio of 1:100; (1 OP = 100 units of currency). The actual type of currency is dependent upon the genre being played, (for instance a fantasy medieval-era game may use gold pieces, a modern action game set in the United States would use dollars, a sci-fi future setting may use galactic credits).

Certain campaigns using the &quot;Fuzion&quot; system can have &quot;Power Points (PPs)&quot;, which are assigned to the players by the Referee just like CPs and OPs. PPs are optional and are used with Magic, Psionics, and Super Powers. CPs can be traded for PPs at a ratio of 1:1, (1 CP = 1 PP), and OPs can be traded as well, at a ratio of 5:1, (5 OP = 1 PP). Using PPs helps the Referee keep superpowers under control by restricting how often a character can use them.

===Primary Stats===

In &quot;Total Fuzion&quot;, a character usually has ten &quot;Stats&quot;, (or Characteristics), organized in four groups as follows:

Physical Group:
*Constitution (CON)
*Strength (STR)
*Body (BODY)
Mental Group:
*Intelligence (INT)
*Willpower (WILL)
*Presence (PRE) (or Personality (PER), or Cool (COOL)
Combat Group:
*Technique (TECH)
*Reflexes (REF)
*Dexterity (DEX)
Movement Group:
*Movement (MOVE)

In the slimmed down &quot;Instant Fuzion&quot; rules, the character has only four main Stats based on each of the four Stat groups: Physical, Mental, Combat, and Movement.

Character Points are used to buy levels in a Stat at a ratio of 1:1; 1 CP buys 1 level of a Stat. For the average &quot;competent&quot; human, each Stat has a level of 3 or 4, while 1 and 2 represent mundane abilities. Stats of 5 and 6 are considered &quot;heroic&quot;; 7 and 8, are &quot;legendary&quot;; 9 and above are &quot;superhuman&quot;.

&quot;Fuzion&quot; is a flexible and easily modifiable system, so more Stats can be added to any category by the Referee as they see fit. For instance, in a magical world, the Referee could add a Mana Stat for the casting and control magic spells, or add a Comeliness Stat, which rates the physical attractiveness of a character. Likewise, Stats can be removed without too much difficulty. If the Referee feels there is no real difference between Dexterity and Reflexes, they could remove one or the other, and use a single Stat for both.

===Derived Stats===
&quot;Fuzion&quot; characters have numerous &quot;Derived Stats&quot;, which get their values based on the level of a primary Stat and performing a mathematical formula to calculate a number. For instance, a character gets Hit Points (called &quot;Hits&quot;), and Stun Points (called &quot;Stun&quot;), by taking their Body Stat and multiplying it by 5. Therefore, a character with a Body Stat of 5 would have 25 Hits and 25 Stun. Derived Stats do not cost points to purchase. Depending on the genre, the Referee can choose what Derived Stats he wants in his campaign. Some are required, like Hits, Stun, and Recovery, but others, like Luck and Humanity, are optional. Characters can also trade up to 1/2 of their Stun points for more Hits if they so desire.

In &quot;Instant Fuzion&quot;, a character has two Derived Stats: Hits and Defense.

===Skills===
&quot;Fuzion&quot; characters have Skills that represent specific areas of knowledge that are useful in the game. Skills are purchased with Option Points at a ratio of 1:1, (1 OP = 1 level of a Skill). &quot;Fuzion&quot; has a large array of Skills to choose from. Referees and players can also make up their own skills as needed. Skills are organized by type:

*Fighting Skills are used mainly in combat situations for evading attacks and using hand held weapons. They may also be used for Martial Arts and unarmed combat. Usually a character focuses on a particular type of weapon, such as Sword, Mace, Dagger and Hand-to-Hand.
*Ranged Fighting Skills are used for handling ranged weapons such as guns and bows. Usually they are focused on a particular type of ranged weapon, such as Crossbow, Shotgun and Rocket Launcher.
*Awareness Skills are such skills as Perception, Search, Tracking and Lip Reading
*Control Skills are used for operating vehicles and handling animals. Usually they are focused on a type of vehicle, such as Automobile driving or Helicopter piloting.
*Physical or Body Skills are such skills as Acrobatics, Climbing, and Stealth.
*Social Skills are such skills as Bribery, Interrogation and Etiquette.
*Technical or Technique Skills are complex skills such as Surgery, First Aid, Demolitions and Lockpicking.
*Performance Skills are such as Acting, Singing, Painting and playing a specific kind of musical instrument.
*Knowledge Skills represent complex areas of specialized education, such as Criminal Law, Forensics, Chemistry, Engineering, and Foreign Language.

For free, a starting character gets a set of &quot;Everyman Skills&quot; that are picked by the Referee as appropriate to the campaign. Everyman Skills include 2 points each in such Skills as Education (which includes all basic knowledge a character learns through years of schooling like basic mathematics and reading for example), and other skills, like Evasion, Hand-to-Hand, Local Area Knowledge and Perception. For a modern or futuristic campaign, Driving and Computer Use may also be common Everyman skills. At the Referee&#x27;s discretion, the Education skill can be used as a catch-all for when a character faces a challenge in a skill they do not possess; they can &quot;wing it&quot; by adding their Education skill bonus to the die roll.

===Character options===
Character options come in the form of Talents, Complications, Perks, Lifepaths, and Templates.

&quot;Talents&quot; represent special innate abilities of a character that cannot be taken away from them, or used by another character. They represent certain areas of special training, or inherited abilities that are not covered by Skills. In a way, they are similar to Advantages in &quot;GURPS&quot;, or Feats in a &quot;d20 System&quot; game, and offer benefits to the character. Talents cost 3 Option Points each. Some Talents include: Combat Sense, Lightning Calculator, Photographic Memory, Light Sleeper, Speed Reading, and Ambidexterity.

&quot;Complications&quot; represent special hindrances to the character. They are similar to Disadvantages in &quot;GURPS&quot;. Complications are a way to gain back OPs to spend elsewhere. Each Complication returns a number of points based on the hindrance they give the character, and how often they crop up in the game. A permanent Complication, such as Missing Limb, is always a problem for a character and returns many points. Others, like Enemy or Dependent, may crop up occasionally during a game and offer less points back. Some other Complications include: Bad Tempered, Sense of Duty, Stubbornness, Dependents, Phobias, Bad Reputation, Poverty, and Addiction.

&quot;Perks&quot; are similar to Talents, but are not innate to the character. They can be lost or taken away by actions in the game. They usually include Special Equipment, Security Clearances, Licenses, Permits, and Contacts (who a character can use to gain information or call in favors from).

&quot;Lifepaths&quot; are an optional way to randomly generate character backgrounds and personalities through a series of tables. A character rolls on a list of options, or they can pick and chose them as they see fit. Some Lifepath choices could give a character a special Talent, Complication, or Perk for free.

&quot;Templates&quot; are featured in certain &quot;Fuzion&quot; campaigns, which can be chosen by players to help design a well rounded character suited for a specific career, (such as police officer, soldier, doctor, etc.). Templates explain things about the character&#x27;s job, and give a listing of particular Skills, Talents, Complications, Perks and starting equipment.

==&quot;Fuzion&quot; game mechanics==
In &quot;Fuzion&quot;, whenever a character performs some kind of critical action that needs to be resolved, they make a die roll to see if they succeed or fail at the task. There are two kinds of resolution tests in &quot;Fuzion&quot;; those rolled against a &quot;Difficulty Value (DV)&quot; determined by the Referee, and those rolled against another character. DVs range from &quot;very easy&quot;, such as hefting a bag of garbage to the street (DV 2), to &quot;cosmic&quot;, like hefting a mountain and throwing it into an ocean (DV 100+). When resolving a contest between characters, the DV of the check is the result of the opposing force&#x27;s roll or, to save time, the Referee could add a set number, &quot;+X&quot;, to an NPC&#x27;s abilities (typically +10 when using 3d6 or +5 using 1d10).

Regardless of what the character is rolling against, the player has to roll the target number or higher on the dice to succeed. This the opposite of &quot;Fuzion&#x27;s&quot; parent, the HERO System (which is similar to the GURPS mechanic), where the roll must be equal to, or less than the target number to succeed.

===Resolving actions===
Under standard rules, &quot;Fuzion&quot; offers two ways to resolve actions with dice. A Referee can pick either using three six-sided dice (3d6), like the HERO System, or one ten-sided die (d10), like the Interlock System used in &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; and &quot;Mekton&quot;. Using 3d6 for checks subjects it to the more predictable &quot;bell curve&quot; and has a higher probability of success. Using a d10 is more unpredictable and adds a level of uncertainty and suspense. When using d10, the DV values are set lower than when using 3d6.

Another aspect of &quot;Fuzion&quot;&#x27;s flexibility is the easy adaptation to the use of d12 or d20 dice for making checks. Consult the table below for variations of the Difficulty Values by die type:
The resolution formula is: &quot;Stat + Skill + Die Roll vs. Difficulty Value (DV)&quot;. When an action is opposed by another character or two characters are competing to complete the same action, the formula becomes &quot;Stat + Skill + Die Roll vs. Stat + Skill + (Die Roll or +X)&quot;. Combat resolution is similar to an opposed skill check. If a character&#x27;s Stat + Skill already meets or exceeds the DV, it is usually considered an automatic success without making a die roll.

There is also the optional rule of &quot;Critical Successes&quot; and &quot;Critical Failures&quot;. If using a d10, rolling a 10 is a Critical Success, and allows a second roll. The result of the second roll is added to the first to calculate the result. Further 10&#x27;s may be rerolled. A roll of 1 is a critical failure and you subtract 1d10 from your total. When using 3d6; a roll of all sixes, (an 18), is a Critical Success, and two additional dice can be rolled and added to the result. A roll of three ones, (a 3), is a Critical Failure, (even if all you only needed to roll was a 3 to succeed the check), and subtract 2d6 from the total. A Critical Failure may represent something more disastrous happening to the character as the Referee sees fit. A Critical Failure on a Lockpicking task, for example, could trigger a silent alarm the character wasn&#x27;t aware of.

===Combat actions===
&quot;Fuzion&quot; uses rounds, (called &quot;Phases&quot;), to time actions taken in combat. A typical Phase in &quot;Fuzion&quot; represents 3 seconds of real time, and 20 Phases = 1 minute.

During a Phase, a character can perform one of several &quot;Basic Actions&quot;, such as Attack, Block (Parry), or Move.

&quot;Advanced Actions&quot; usually take more time and additional phases to perform, like casting a spell, or performing another complex task.

&quot;Free Actions&quot; take such little time that can be performed immediately and do not use up time, such as dropping an item, standing up, or calling to an ally. The character in a party with the highest Reflexes stat acts first, or they can hold the action and wait to see what someone else is doing. There are no Initiative checks unless the Referee decides to randomly see who goes first. In such a case, the Reflexes Stat can be added to the 3d6 die roll. Usually a party of several NPC&#x27;s act on one Initiative. Initiative is rolled again for each combat Phase, or to save time, the GM can opt to use the same initiative for the rest of the combat scene.

When making an opposed roll against another character, (or NPC), the resolution is handled differently and attempt to counteract what the opposition does.

The typical opposed check formula is:
&quot;Attack Value (AV) + Die Roll vs. Defense Value (DV) + Die Roll, or Defense Value + Flat X&quot;

To make things easier, a player should calculate their character&#x27;s AVs and DVs ahead of time before beginning play. Another option for the defender to choose &quot;Flat X&quot;, (or Flat 10), where the Difficulty is always 10 + the defender&#x27;s DV. The attacker only rolls dice during the combat Phase, which helps speed a combat scene along. The Flat X can be further modified by armor, cover and range penalties.

===Resolving damage===
Living characters in &quot;Fuzion&quot; can take two kinds of damage; &quot;Lethal Damage&quot;, (that subtracts Hits), or &quot;Stun Damage&quot;, that subtracts Stun points. When Hits fall to zero, a character is unconscious and may be dying. Losing further Hits can kill a character if it should fall twice below their Body Stat, that is, a character with Body 5, (and 25 Hits), dies when his Hits fall to -10. When Stun falls to zero, a character is out cold. At this point, any further damage becomes &quot;Stun Rollover&quot; at 1/5 the Stun damage and begin deducting from their Hits. When a character loses 1/2 of their Hits, all their stats drop by 2. If 3/4 Hits are lost, all stats drop by 4.

Inanimate objects, have &quot;Structural Damage Points&quot; or SDPs. When an object loses all its SDPs, it is rendered useless; (a vehicle shuts down and grinds to a halt, a weapon will no longer fire, etc.). It is destroyed when it reaches twice its SDPs in damage. To keep things simple, (and to avoid too much rolling of dice), large scale weapons inflict points of damage called &quot;Kills&quot;, which represent destruction on a much larger scale. Kills are used for such things as giant mecha robots and spaceships. Weapons that inflict Kill damage are not usually small enough to be carried around by characters.

Character sized weapons in &quot;Fuzion&quot; have &quot;Damage Classes&quot;, or (DCs). Each point of DC represents a six-sided die that is rolled to see how much damage the weapon can cause. Six-sided dice are always used for damage rolls, regardless of using a d10 (or other die types) for checks. For instance, a lightweight handgun typically has a DC of 3; meaning 3d6 is rolled to determine the damage it causes when it hits something. Some weapons also have a &quot;Weapon Accuracy (WA)&quot; value. This number is further added to the Attack roll and raise the chances of getting a successful hit.

Melee weapon sometimes have a &quot;Minimum Strength&quot; value. This is an optional rule to add more realism. A character must possess the listed minimum level of STR to fully inflict the weapon&#x27;s damage. For every point of STR under the minimum, the weapon does one less die of damage. For example: A Battleaxe has a DC 5 and a Minimum STR of 5. A character with an STR 3, that uses the Battleaxe, suffers a -2 penalty to his Attack roll. It will also only inflict DC 3 of damage because the character&#x27;s STR is 2 less than the minimum of 5. The character also suffers a -2 penalty to any Reflex checks and Reflex-based Skill checks when wielding the weapon.

For unarmed physical damage, a character deals 1 DC of punching damage per level of STR Stat, that is, a character with STR 3 does 3 DC of damage. Kicking adds an additional DC, that is, with a STR of 3, a character deals 4 DC of damage with a kick.

Some &quot;Fuzion&quot; campaigns offer an optional &quot;Hit Location Chart&quot; where 3d6 is rolled to determine which part of the body is hit by an attack. Depending on the location, the damage may be modified. For instance, if damage is applied to the head, the damage taken is doubled. If a hand is struck, the damage is halved. Using Hit Locations allows &quot;Called Shots&quot; with a -4 penalty to an attack roll to strike a specific area.

===Rewards===
After a good game of &quot;Fuzion&quot;, Referees can reward characters with more Option Points, (or Award Points), which they can use to improve skills, and convert to money to buy more equipment. Enough OPs that are saved up can later allow a player to raise a Stat or two, and maybe buy a Talent or Perk, however the price for future ability upgrades becomes costly and keeps characters from becoming too powerful, too quickly. For example, to raise a skill from 4 to 5 costs a number of Option Points per point of the skill&#x27;s next level. In this case, 5 option points. To raise it again to 6, costs 6 more points. To raise a primary stat costs 5 option points per level starting with the first. For example, to raise a stat from 4 to 5 costs 25 option points (5x5). Again to 6 would cost 30 more points (5x6).

<text>R. P. Saraf, full name Ram Piara Saraf, (1924 – 24 June 2009) was a Kashmiri politician.

In 1952, Saraf was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir from the Kadal constituency. He was a member of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly for ten years. In 1958, he co founded the Democratic National Conference.

Saraf was a leader in the early years of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). In Kashmir the entire Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) organization had gone with Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)). At the CPI(ML) party congress in 1970 Saraf was elected to the Central Committee. The formerly CPI(M) local organ &quot;Jammu Sandesh&quot; became the regional CPI(ML) publication.

In 1986, Saraf founded his own splinter group, the Internationalist Democratic Party. Two former Members of the Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, Kristhan Dev Sethi and Abdul Kabir Wani, joined Saraf&#x27;s group.

At the end of December 2002 the Nature-Human Centric Peoples Movement (NHCPM) was formed under his guidance.

<text>Rodven Records was a Venezuelan record label that belonged to the Cisneros family owned ODC Group, then proprietors of one of the largest TV networks in the country, Venevision. They also owned a nationwide AM radio network (RadioVision, which later expanded into the FM realm as FM Center) and a record stores chain (DiscoCenter), thus serving as a channel for those artists who belonged to the roster of either of those companies (mostly signed to Venevision).

==Early years==

In its beginnings, SonoRodven (As it was originally named) emerged as a local source for international compilation albums (mostly those produced in the U.S. by companies such as K-Tel). Then it started handling a small roster of local luminaries, some of them also performing as actors for its sister TV network, such as Guillermo Dávila, Karina, Ricardo Montaner, Jose Luis Rodriguez &quot;El Puma&quot;, Marcelo, and others. Then the roster began to grow up, and it became the second biggest local record label in Venezuela, alongside Sonográfica, its biggest competitor, from the rival group &quot;Empresas 1BC&quot; (proprietors of rival TV network RCTV, rival radio network RCR, rival record stores chain &quot;Recordland&quot;). Later, in the early-middle eighties, it became the Rodven Group, also comprising Video-Rodven, a commercial home video company, as well as other small record labels that previously existed in the country, such as Velvet (thus becoming VelvetRodven and later TH-Rodven, an outlet for all Latin dance music oriented artists, and later for other youth and pop acts, such as the late 80s boyband &quot;Los Chamos&quot;, from which emerged the Venezuelan singer Carlos Baute), Love Records, and forming alliances with other record labels from around the world for local distribution purposes (thus forming EMI-Rodven, Hispavox-Rodven, Ariola-Rodven, Wea-Rodven et al.). This made Rodven&#x27;s roster even bigger, allowing for the distribution of both local and foreign acts through a complete radio/TV/distribution platform, which later gave birth also to an artist management and show services company: &quot;Big Show Productions&quot;.

==Later years==
By 1994, the label was responsible for releasing about 10% of the Latin music market in the United States, and had its American headquarters in Miami. It was ultimately acquired by PolyGram in 1995 (which itself was later acquired by Universal Music Group in 1999). The record label was well known for popular Latin pop and salsa singers during the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;El Club de Los Tigritos&quot; alumni and teen idol Douglas Vale released his debut album &quot;Aun Soy Chamo&quot; only in Venezuela under Rodven and the breakthrough album &quot;Hieroglyphics&quot; associated with Maverick Records and Warner Music Group.

The Rodven catalog is currently owned by Universal Music Group through Universal Music Latin Entertainment with Machete Music managing the Tropical catalog and Universal Music Latino managing the non-Tropical catalogs.

<text>George Outlaw (October 25, 1771 – August 15, 1825) was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina in 1825.

Outlaw, born near Windsor, North Carolina, in Bertie County, was educated by private teachers and in the common schools. He engaged in agricultural and mercantile pursuits and was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons for a term in 1796 to 1797. He rose to the North Carolina Senate, serving in 1802 from 1806 to 1808 from 1810 to 1814, 1817, 1821, and 1822, where he was that body&#x27;s speaker in 1812, 1813, and 1814.

Following the resignation of Rep. Hutchins Burton, Outlaw was sent to the 18th U.S. Congress in a special election; he served for less than two months in Congress, from January 19, 1825, to March 3, 1825. Outlaw was defeated in his campaign for re-election by Willis Alston in a three-way race. Alston, who had served previously from 1799 to 1815, criticized Outlaw&#x27;s vote for William H. Crawford in the contingent presidential election of 1825. Outlaw&#x27;s vote reflected the vote of the 2d Congressional District (which had voted Crawford 1,516 to Jackson 957), but the voters agreed with Alston and elected him over Outlaw by a 42-31% margin (with an Adams supporter winning 27%). Afterwards, he resumed agricultural and mercantile pursuits and died in Windsor in 1825, where he is buried in his family cemetery.

Outlaw was the cousin of Rep. David Outlaw.

<text>In quantum field theory, a false vacuum is a hypothetical vacuum state that is locally stable but does not occupy the most stable possible ground state. In this condition it is called metastable. It may last for a very long time in this state, but could eventually decay to the more stable one, an event known as false vacuum decay. The most common suggestion of how such a decay might happen in our universe is called bubble nucleation – if a small region of the universe by chance reached a more stable vacuum, this &quot;bubble&quot; (also called &quot;bounce&quot;) would spread.

A false vacuum exists at a local minimum of energy and is therefore not completely stable, in contrast to a true vacuum, which exists at a global minimum and is stable.

== Definition of true vs. false vacuum ==
A vacuum is defined as a space with as little energy in it as possible. Despite the name, the vacuum still has quantum fields. A true vacuum is stable because it is at a global minimum of energy, and is commonly assumed to coincide with the physical vacuum state we live in. It is possible that a physical vacuum state is a configuration of quantum fields representing a local minimum but not global minimum of energy. This type of vacuum state is called a &quot;false vacuum&quot;.

== Implications ==

=== Existential threat ===
If our universe is in a false vacuum state rather than a true vacuum state, then the decay from the less stable false vacuum to the more stable true vacuum (called false vacuum decay) could have dramatic consequences. The effects could range from complete cessation of existing fundamental forces, elementary particles and structures comprising them, to subtle change in some cosmological parameters, mostly depending on the potential difference between true and false vacuum. Some false vacuum decay scenarios are compatible with the survival of structures like galaxies, stars, and even biological life, while others involve the full destruction of baryonic matter or even immediate gravitational collapse of the universe. In this more extreme case, the likelihood of a &quot;bubble&quot; forming is very low (i.e. false vacuum decay may be impossible).

A paper by Coleman and De Luccia that attempted to include simple gravitational assumptions into these theories noted that if this was an accurate representation of nature, then the resulting universe &quot;inside the bubble&quot; in such a case would appear to be extremely unstable and would almost immediately collapse:
In a 2005 paper published in &quot;Nature&quot;, as part of their investigation into global catastrophic risks, MIT physicist Max Tegmark and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1/109 per year from all natural (i.e. non-anthropogenic) events, including a transition to a lower vacuum state. They argue that due to observer selection effects, we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would reach us only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and hypernovae, the frequencies of which we have adequate direct measures.

=== Inflation ===
A number of theories suggest that cosmic inflation may be an effect of a false vacuum decaying into the true vacuum. The inflation itself may be the consequence of the Higgs field trapped in a false vacuum state with Higgs self-coupling λ and its βλ function very close to zero at the planck scale. A future electron-positron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations.

Chaotic inflation theory suggests that the universe may be in either a false vacuum or a true vacuum state. Alan Guth, in his original proposal for cosmic inflation, proposed that inflation could end through quantum mechanical bubble nucleation of the sort described above. See history of Chaotic inflation theory. It was soon understood that a homogeneous and isotropic universe could not be preserved through the violent tunneling process. This led Andrei Linde and, independently, Andreas Albrecht and Paul Steinhardt, to propose &quot;new inflation&quot; or &quot;slow roll inflation&quot; in which no tunnelling occurs, and the inflationary scalar field instead graphs as a gentle slope.

In 2014, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences&#x27; Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics gave an actual mathematical demonstration of the already existing idea that the universe could have been spontaneously created from nothing (no space, time, nor matter) by quantum fluctuations of a metastable false vacuum causing an expanding bubble of true vacuum.

==Vacuum decay varieties==
===Electroweak vacuum decay===
The stability criteria for the electroweak interaction was first formulated in 1979 as a function of the masses of the theoretical Higgs boson and the heaviest fermion. Discovery of the top quark in 1995 and the Higgs boson in 2012 have allowed physicists to validate the criteria against experiment, therefore since 2012 the electroweak interaction is considered as the most promising candidate for a metastable fundamental force. The corresponding false vacuum hypothesis is called either &quot;Electroweak vacuum instability&quot; or &quot;Higgs vacuum instability&quot;. The present false vacuum state is called formula_1 (de Sitter space), while tentative true vacuum is called formula_2 (Anti-de Sitter space).

The diagrams show the uncertainty ranges of Higgs boson and top quark masses as oval-shaped lines. Underlying colors indicate if the electroweak vacuum state is likely to be stable, merely long-lived or completely unstable for given combination of masses. The &quot;electroweak vacuum decay&quot; hypothesis was sometimes misreported as the Higgs boson &quot;ending&quot; the universe.
A 125.18±0.16   Higgs boson mass is likely to be on the metastable side of stable-metastable boundary (estimated in 2012 as .) A definitive answer requires much more precise measurements of the top quark&#x27;s pole mass, however, although improved measurement precision of Higgs boson and top quark masses further reinforced the claim of physical electroweak vacuum being in the metastable state as of 2018. Nonetheless, new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics could drastically change the stability landscape division lines, rendering previous stability and metastability criteria incorrect.
Reanalysis of 2016 LHC run data in 2022 has yielded a slightly lower top quark mass of 171.77 GeV, close to vacuum stability line but still in the metastable zone.

If measurements of the Higgs boson and top quark suggest that our universe lies within a false vacuum of this kind, this would imply that the bubble&#x27;s effects will propagate across the universe at nearly the speed of light from its origin in space-time. A direct calculation within the Standard Model of the lifetime of our vacuum state finds that it is greater than formula_3years with 95% confidence.

===Other decay modes===
* Decay to smaller vacuum expectation value, resulting in decrease of Casimir effect and destabilization of proton.
* Decay to vacuum with larger neutrino mass (may have happened as late as few billion years ago).
* Decay to vacuum with no dark energy.
* Decay of the false vacuum at finite temperature was first observed in ferromagnetic superfluids of ultracold atoms.

==Bubble nucleation==

When the false vacuum decays, the lower-energy true vacuum forms through a process known as bubble nucleation. In this process, instanton effects cause a bubble containing the true vacuum to appear. The walls of the bubble (or domain walls) have a positive surface tension, as energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the true vacuum. The former tends as the cube of the bubble&#x27;s radius while the latter is proportional to the square of its radius, so there is a critical size formula_4 at which the total energy of the bubble is zero; smaller bubbles tend to shrink, while larger bubbles tend to grow. To be able to nucleate, the bubble must overcome an energy barrier of height

where formula_5 is the difference in energy between the true and false vacuums, formula_6 is the unknown (possibly extremely large) surface tension of the domain wall, and formula_7 is the radius of the bubble. Rewriting gives the critical radius as
.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

A bubble smaller than the critical size can overcome the potential barrier via quantum tunnelling of instantons to lower energy states. For a large potential barrier, the tunneling rate per unit volume of space is given by
 e^{-\Phi_c/\hbar},&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_8 is the reduced Planck constant. As soon as a bubble of lower-energy vacuum grows beyond the critical radius defined by , the bubble&#x27;s wall will begin to accelerate outward. Due to the typically large difference in energy between the false and true vacuums, the speed of the wall approaches the speed of light extremely quickly. The bubble does not produce any gravitational effects because the negative energy density of the bubble interior is cancelled out by the positive kinetic energy of the wall.

Small bubbles of true vacuum can be inflated to critical size by providing energy, although required energy densities are several orders of magnitude larger than what is attained in any natural or artificial process. It is also thought that certain environments can catalyze bubble formation by lowering the potential barrier.

Bubble wall has a finite thickness, depending on ratio between energy barrier and energy gain obtained by creating true vacuum. In the case when potential barrier height between true and false vacua is much smaller than energy difference between vacua, shell thickness become comparable with critical radius.

===Nucleation seeds===

In general, gravity is believed to stabilize a false vacuum state, at least for transition from formula_1 (de Sitter space) to formula_2 (Anti-de Sitter space), while topological defects including cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles may enhance decay probability.

====Black holes as nucleation seeds====
In a study in 2015, it was pointed out that the vacuum decay rate could be vastly increased in the vicinity of black holes, which would serve as a nucleation seed. According to this study, a potentially catastrophic vacuum decay could be triggered at any time by primordial black holes, should they exist. The authors note, however, that if primordial black holes cause a false vacuum collapse, then it should have happened long before humans evolved on Earth. A subsequent study in 2017 indicated that the bubble would collapse into a primordial black hole rather than originate from it, either by ordinary collapse or by bending space in such a way that it breaks off into a new universe. In 2019, it was found that although small non-spinning black holes may increase true vacuum nucleation rate, rapidly spinning black holes will stabilize false vacuums to decay rates lower than expected for flat space-time.

If particle collisions produce mini black holes, then energetic collisions such as the ones produced in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) could trigger such a vacuum decay event, a scenario that has attracted the attention of the news media. It is likely to be unrealistic, because if such mini black holes can be created in collisions, they would also be created in the much more energetic collisions of cosmic radiation particles with planetary surfaces or during the early life of the universe as tentative primordial black holes. Hut and Rees note that, because cosmic ray collisions have been observed at much higher energies than those produced in terrestrial particle accelerators, these experiments should not, at least for the foreseeable future, pose a threat to our current vacuum. Particle accelerators have reached energies of only approximately eight tera electron volts (8×1012 eV). Cosmic ray collisions have been observed at and beyond energies of 5×1019 eV, six million times more powerful – the so-called Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit – and cosmic rays in vicinity of origin may be more powerful yet. John Leslie has argued that if present trends continue, particle accelerators will exceed the energy given off in naturally occurring cosmic ray collisions by the year 2150. Fears of this kind were raised by critics of both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider at the time of their respective proposal, and determined to be unfounded by scientific inquiry.

In a 2021 paper by Rostislav Konoplich and others, it was postulated that the area between a pair of large black holes on the verge of colliding could provide the conditions to create bubbles of &quot;true vacuum&quot;. Intersecting surfaces between these bubbles could then become infinitely dense and form micro-black holes. These would in turn evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation in the 10 milliseconds or so before the larger black holes collided and devoured any bubbles or micro-black holes in their way. The theory could be tested by looking for the Hawking radiation emitted just before the black holes merge.

== Bubble propagation==
A bubble wall, propagating outward at nearly the speed of light, has a finite thickness, depending on the ratio between the energy barrier and the energy gain obtained by creating true vacuum. In the case when the potential barrier height between true and false vacua is much smaller than the energy difference between vacua, the bubble wall thickness becomes comparable to the critical radius.

Elementary particles entering the wall will likely decay to other particles or black holes. If all decay paths lead to very massive particles, the energy barrier of such a decay may result in a stable bubble of false vacuum (also known as a Fermi ball) enclosing the false-vacuum particle instead of immediate decay. Multi-particle objects can be stabilized as Q-balls, although these objects will eventually collide and decay either into black holes or true-vacuum particles.

== False vacuum decay in fiction ==
False vacuum decay event is occasionally used as a plot device in works picturing a doomsday event.

<text>Sharp Wizard is a series of electronic organizers released by Sharp Corporation. The first model was the &quot;OZ-7000&quot; released in 1989, making it one of the first electronic organizers to be sold. The name &quot;OZ-7000&quot; was used for the USA market, while in Europe the device was known as the &quot;IQ-7000&quot;.

==Specifications and history==
The OZ-7000 was about 6.3 inches (163 mm) tall, 3.7 inches (94 mm) wide closed, 7.25 inches (184 mm) open, and 0.85 inches (21.5 mm) thick closed, making it much larger than later PDAs. It featured a serial port (proprietary connector) to attach to a Windows PC or Macintosh or another OZ-7xxx/OZ-8xxx device, an optional thermal printer port and a cassette tape backup. The OZ-7000/IQ-7000 model featured 32 kilobytes of internal memory and a 96 x 64 dot (8 lines x 16 characters or 4 lines x 12 characters) black and white LCD with controllable contrast but without a back light. A major advertised feature of the model was the &quot;IC Cards&quot; expansion slot for accessory cards developed by Sharp.

The expansion cards (IC Cards) were about the same size and shape of PC Cards but predated this standard and were incompatible with the latter. The IC Cards were inserted in a slot behind a transparent plastic panel with an overlay touch-sensitive sensor organized in a 4x5 array of touch zones, thus allowing up to 20 &quot;buttons&quot; to be used for control of IC Cards functions. The selection of IC cards included memory expansion cards, a thesaurus dictionary, a Time and Expense Manager, an Investment Planner, a bilingual and 8-Language translators, an &quot;Encyclopaedia of Wine&quot; and even games like &quot;Box Jockey&quot; (a Sokoban clone), Tetris, chess and backgammon. A spreadsheet software card capable of handling 26 columns by 999 rows tables compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 was available too.

The out-of-the-box functionality of the &quot;OZ-7000&quot;/&quot;IQ-7000&quot; included a memo pad, a telephone pad, calendar and scheduling with alarms and repeating events, multi-time zone clocks, and a calculator, thus covering all the basic functions found in PDAs since. The keyboard was not QWERTY, although later models, starting with OZ/IQ-8000, changed the orientation of the screen and keyboard layout.

In 1991 Sharp released an enhanced version of IQ-7000 — the &quot;IQ-7200&quot; with internal memory increased up to 64K.

The &quot;OZ-8000&quot; followed later in 1991, with a larger (240 x 64 dot) screen and 64K of internal, non-volatile memory. The &quot;OZ-8200&quot; was launched at the same time with 128K of internal non-volatile memory. Both models shared the same form factor. A custom fitted leather, padded carrying case was also available for both models. The devices opened in landscape rather than portrait orientation with the IC Cards slot position changed accordingly.

The &quot;OZ-9600&quot; and &quot;OZ-9600II&quot; were the last of in this family of PDA in the Wizard line. Later Wizard organizers were smaller, dispensing with the expansion slot and soon bore little resemblance to the original &quot;OZ-7000&quot;.

In 1991 Sharp released also a series of IC cards allowing programming in BASIC for the OZ-7000, thus turning the organizer to more a PDA-like device. The same version of BASIC had been used in later Sharp PDAs, both Wizards and pocket computers such as the Sharp PC-E500S. The line of devices utilizing touch-controlled IC cards had been concluded with the &quot;IQ-8500&quot; model.

Starting with the &quot;OZ-8900&quot; and, later, the &quot;OZ-9xxx&quot; series, Sharp moved to production of clam-shell design/touch-sensitive display devices. Newer Wizards had an integrated IR transmitter allowing data exchange with PCs or other OZ-9xxx devices. The innovative design had the main features of the initial Zaurus line which continued this PDA family for Sharp. Due to new features, &quot;IC Cards&quot; for these devices were not backwards compatible with the OZ-7xxx series.
The later Sharp Wizards were something between an electronic databank and a PDA. They were small, lightweight devices with keyboards but no touch screen, running on a Zilog Z80.

Starting with the &quot;ZQ-770&quot;, model numbers had the prefixes either of &quot;OZ&quot; (for the USA market, where the prefix from the beginning was meant to be a pun on The Wizard of Oz) or &quot;ZQ&quot; (rest of the world) followed by a number, for instance &quot;ZQ-770,&quot; a non-US organizer with 3 MB memory, thus abandoning the IQ prefix used earlier.

<text>Hip-O Records is a record label that specializes in reissues and compilations. It is part of Universal Music Group. Established in 1996, the label has distributed releases from &#x27;out of style&#x27; genres such as disco and early hip-hop music as well as publishing film soundtracks. The label&#x27;s name is a pun on the name &#x27;hippo&#x27;.

==History==
The name &quot;Hip-O Records&quot; is a play on the word &quot;hip&quot; and the already-existing Rhino Records. The formation of Hip-O Records has its roots in Universal Music Group Chairman &amp; CEO Doug Morris&#x27; relationship with Rhino. As co-Chairman of Atlantic Records during the early 1990s and then President &amp; C.O.O. of Warner Music Group (U.S.), Morris observed Rhino&#x27;s great financial success at cross country rivals Capitol/EMI. EMI had taken an equity position in Rhino Records as an ideal two way relationship. Rhino provided invaluable assistance in the packaging and marketing of EMI&#x27;s catalog, and EMI provided Rhino with increasingly difficult to access master recordings. Their association had been extremely prestigious and profitable for both. During a 1992 renegotiation, Morris took a 50% stake in Rhino, which only energized the profitability and success of both.

Morris left Warner Music Group in 1995 during an internal shake-up and immediately landed at what was then called MCA Music Entertainment Group. He recognized the history of the group&#x27;s labels provided a parallel opportunity to market the vintage catalog of masters, but Rhino&#x27;s magical executive team was tied up tight in the deal he signed with them at Atlantic. Morris launched his own catalog label that shadowed Rhino Records in every way, down to the company&#x27;s name.

Today, as part of Universal Music Group, Hip-O reissues many albums from UMG&#x27;s huge back catalogue - including such labels as Decca, Interscope, Geffen, A&amp;M, Mercury, Polydor, MCA, Island and others.

==Hip-O Select==
Hip-O Select, Hip-O&#x27;s limited edition reissue label, was co-founded by UMe VP Pat Lawrence and former Rhino Records exec Thane Tierney. It released remastered classics by artists including The Supremes, Chuck Berry, Rupert Holmes, Bo Diddley, Ken Nordine, Etta James, Dobie Gray, The Miracles, Burt Bacharach, Tammi Terrell, Doug Sahm, and Muddy Waters, among others. It released the &quot;Complete Motown Singles&quot;, a series of fourteen box sets which include both sides of every single from Motown Records and its subsidiaries during that company&#x27;s Detroit era. Their catalog includes a number of previously unreleased albums and compilations from the Motown, Mercury, Polydor, MCA, ABC, A&amp;M, Dot, Decca, and 20th Century Records vaults. Hip-O Select also released a multi-volume set of James Brown&#x27;s complete singles.

Unlike limited releases made by competitor Rhino Handmade, Hip-O Select has its catalog available for purchase on iTunes.

In 2015, Vivendi pulled the plug on Hip-O Select and all of the Hip-O Select titles are now out of print.

<text>The Adirondack Guideboat is a rowboat that was developed in the 1840s for recreational activities in Adirondack Park. It was designed to have a shallow draft, carry three people and their gear, and be light enough to be portaged by one man, the guide. Typical dimensions are 16 feet long, with a 38 inch beam, and weighing 60 pounds. While superficially resembling a canoe in size and profile, its construction methods are very different and are one of its defining features.

The stem and ribs are made from spruce, a wood which has a very good strength to weight ratio. The hull is planked up with cedar laps, with seams tacked with copper tacks. The hull has a bottom board, like a dory, typically made of pine. Ribs are traditionally cut from spruce roots which have a grain following the desired curvature of the rib.

Since 1962 the annual Willard Hanmer Guideboat Race has been held on the closest Sunday to the 4th of July in Saranac Lake. It is a 10-mile canoe and kayak race on Lake Flower and down the Saranac River. 

Modern hand-crafted versions can sell for about 20,000 US dollars.

<doc id="1198684" wikidata="Q2016936" url="?curid=1198684" title="Referred pain">
<text>Referred pain, also called reflective pain, is pain perceived at a location other than the site of the painful stimulus. An example is the case of angina pectoris brought on by a myocardial infarction (heart attack), where pain is often felt in the left side of neck, left shoulder, and back rather than in the thorax (chest), the site of the injury. The International Association for the Study of Pain has not officially defined the term; hence, several authors have defined it differently. Referred pain has been described since the late 1880s. Despite an increasing amount of literature on the subject, the biological mechanism of referred pain is unknown, although there are several hypotheses.

Radiating pain is slightly different from referred pain; for example, the pain related to a myocardial infarction could either be referred or radiating pain from the chest. Referred pain is when the pain is located away from or adjacent to the organ involved; for instance, when a person has pain only in their jaw or left arm, but not in the chest. Radiating pain would have an origin, where the patient &quot;can&quot; perceive pain, but the pain also spreads (&quot;radiates&quot;) out from this origin point to cause the pain to be perceived in a wider area in addition. 

==Characteristics==
* The size of referred pain is related to the intensity and duration of ongoing/evoked pain.
* Temporal summation is a potent mechanism for generation of referred muscle pain.
* Central hyperexcitability is important for the extent of referred pain.
* Patients with chronic musculoskeletal pains have enlarged referred pain areas to experimental stimuli. The proximal spread of referred muscle pain is seen in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and very seldom is it seen in healthy individuals.
* Modality-specific somatosensory changes occur in referred areas, which emphasize the importance of using a multimodal sensory test regime for assessment.
* Referred pain is often experienced on the same side of the body as the source, but not always.

==Mechanism==
There are several proposed mechanisms for referred pain. Currently there is no definitive consensus regarding which is correct. The cardiac general visceral sensory pain fibers follow the sympathetics back to the spinal cord and have their cell bodies located in thoracic dorsal root ganglia 1-4(5).
As a general rule, in the thorax and abdomen, general visceral afferent (GVA) pain fibers follow sympathetic fibers back to the same spinal cord segments that gave rise to the preganglionic sympathetic fibers.
The central nervous system (CNS) perceives pain from the heart as coming from the somatic portion of the body supplied by the thoracic spinal cord segments 1-4(5). Classically the pain associated with a myocardial infarction is located in the mid or left side of the chest where the heart is actually located. The pain can radiate to the left side of the jaw and into the left arm. Myocardial infarction can rarely present as referred pain and this usually occurs in people with diabetes or older age. Also, the dermatomes of this region of the body wall and upper limb have their neuronal cell bodies in the same dorsal root ganglia (T1-5) and synapse in the same second order neurons in the spinal cord segments (T1-5) as the general visceral sensory fibers from the heart. The CNS does not clearly discern whether the pain is coming from the body wall or from the viscera, but it perceives the pain as coming from somewhere on the body wall, i.e. substernal pain, left arm/hand pain, jaw pain.

===Convergent-projection===
This represents one of the earliest theories on the subject of referred pain. It is based on the work of W.A. Sturge and J. Ross from 1888 and later TC Ruch in 1961. Convergent projection proposes that afferent nerve fibers from tissues converge onto the same spinal neuron, and explains why referred pain is believed to be segmented in much the same way as the spinal cord. Additionally, experimental evidence shows that when local pain (pain at the site of stimulation) is intensified the referred pain is intensified as well.

Criticism of this model arises from its inability to explain why there is a delay between the onset of referred pain after local pain stimulation. Experimental evidence also shows that referred pain is often unidirectional. For example, stimulated local pain in the anterior tibial muscle causes referred pain in the ventral portion of the ankle; however referred pain moving in the opposite direction has not been shown experimentally. Lastly, the threshold for the local pain stimulation and the referred pain stimulation are different, but according to this model they should both be the same.

===Convergence-facilitation===
Convergence facilitation was conceived in 1893 by J MacKenzie based on the ideas of Sturge and Ross. He believed that the internal organs were insensitive to stimuli. Furthermore, he believed that non-nociceptive afferent inputs to the spinal cord created what he termed &quot;an irritable focus&quot;. This focus caused some stimuli to be perceived as referred pain. However, his ideas did not gain widespread acceptance from critics due to its dismissal of visceral pain.

Recently this idea has regained some credibility under a new term, central sensitization. Central sensitization occurs when neurons in the spinal cord&#x27;s dorsal horn or brainstem become more responsive after repeated stimulation by peripheral neurons, so that weaker signals can trigger them. The delay in appearance of referred pain shown in laboratory experiments can be explained due to the time required to create the central sensitization.

===Axon-reflex===
Axon reflex suggests that the afferent fiber is bifurcated before connecting to the dorsal horn. Bifurcated fibers do exist in muscle, skin, and intervertebral discs. Yet these particular neurons are rare and are not representative of the whole body. Axon-Reflex also does not explain the time delay before the appearance of referred pain, threshold differences for stimulating local and referred pain, and somatosensory sensibility changes in the area of referred pain.

===Hyperexcitability===
Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that referred pain has no central mechanism. However, it does say that there is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that referred pain sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created as a result of the opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.

Several characteristics are in line with this mechanism of referred pain, such as dependency on stimulus and the time delay in the appearance of referred pain as compared to local pain. However, the appearance of new receptive fields, which is interpreted to be referred pain, conflicts with the majority of experimental evidence from studies including studies of healthy individuals. Furthermore, referred pain generally appears within seconds in humans as opposed to minutes in animal models. Some scientists attribute this to a mechanism or influence downstream in the supraspinal pathways. Neuroimaging techniques such as PET scans or fMRI may visualize the underlying neural processing pathways responsible in future testing.

===Thalamic-convergence===
Thalamic convergence suggests that referred pain is perceived as such due to the summation of neural inputs in the brain, as opposed to the spinal cord, from the injured area and the referred area. Experimental evidence on thalamic convergence is lacking. However, pain studies performed on monkeys revealed convergence of several pathways upon separate cortical and subcortical neurons.

==Examples==

==Laboratory testing methods==
Pain is studied in a laboratory setting due to the greater amount of control that can be exerted. For example, the modality, intensity, and timing of painful stimuli can be controlled with much more precision. Within this setting there are two main ways that referred pain is studied.

===Algogenic substances===
In recent years several different chemicals have been used to induce referred pain including bradykinin, substance P, capsaicin, and serotonin. However, before any of these substances became widespread in their use a solution of hypertonic saline was used instead. Through various experiments it was determined that there were multiple factors that correlated with saline administration such as infusion rate, saline concentration, pressure, and amount of saline used. The mechanism by which the saline induces a local and referred pain pair is unknown. Some researchers have commented that it could be due to osmotic differences, however that is not verified.

===Using electrical stimulation===
Intramuscular electrical stimulation (IMES) of muscle tissue has been used in various experimental and clinical settings. The advantage to using an IMES system over a standard such as hypertonic saline is that IMES can be turned on and off. This allows the researcher to exert a much higher degree of control and precision in terms of the stimulus and the measurement of the response. The method is easier to carry out than the injection method as it does not require special training in how it should be used. The frequency of the electrical pulse can also be controlled. For most studies a frequency of about 10 Hz is needed to stimulate both local and referred pain.

Using this method it has been observed that significantly higher stimulus strength is needed to obtain referred pain relative to the local pain. There is also a strong correlation between the stimulus intensity and the intensity of referred and local pain. It is also believed that this method causes a larger recruitment of nociceptor units resulting in a spatial summation. This spatial summation results in a much larger barrage of signals to the dorsal horn and brainstem neurons.

==Use in clinical diagnosis and treatments==
Referred pain can be indicative of nerve damage. A case study done on a 63-year-old man with an injury sustained during his childhood developed referred pain symptoms after his face or back was touched. After even a light touch, there was a shooting pain in his arm. The study concluded that his pain was possibly due to a neural reorganization which sensitized regions of his face and back after the nerve damage occurred. It is mentioned that this case is very similar to what phantom limb syndrome patients experience. This conclusion was based on experimental evidence gathered by V. S. Ramachandran in 1993, with the difference being that the arm that is in pain is still attached to the body.

===Orthopedic diagnosis===
From the above examples one can see why understanding of referred pain can lead to better diagnoses of various conditions and diseases. In 1981 physiotherapist Robin McKenzie described what he termed &quot;centralization&quot;. He concluded that centralization occurs when referred pain moves from a distal to a more proximal location. Observations in support of this idea were seen when patients would bend backward and forward during an examination.

Studies have reported that the majority of patients that experienced centralization were able to avoid spinal surgery through isolating the area of local pain. However, the patients who did not experience centralization had to undergo surgery to diagnose and correct the problems. As a result of this study there has been a further research into the elimination of referred pain through certain body movements.

One example of this is referred pain in the calf. McKenzie showed that the referred pain would move closer to the spine when the patient bent backwards in full extension a few times. More importantly, the referred pain would dissipate even after the movements were stopped.

===General diagnosis===
As with myocardial ischaemia, referred pain in a certain portion of the body can lead to a diagnosis of the correct local center. Somatic mapping of referred pain and the corresponding local centers has led to various topographic maps being produced to aid in pinpointing the location of pain based on the referred areas. For example, local pain stimulated in the esophagus is capable of producing referred pain in the upper abdomen, the oblique muscles, and the throat. Local pain in the prostate can radiate referred pain to the abdomen, lower back, and calf muscles. Kidney stones can cause visceral pain in the ureter as the stone is slowly passed into the excretory system. This can cause immense referred pain in the lower abdominal wall.

Further, recent research has found that ketamine, a sedative, is capable of blocking referred pain. The study was conducted on patients with fibromyalgia, a disease characterized by joint and muscle pain and fatigue. These patients were looked at specifically due to their increased sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, referred pain appears in a different pattern in fibromyalgic patients than non-fibromyalgic patients. Often this difference manifests as a difference in terms of the area that the referred pain is found (distal vs. proximal) as compared to the local pain. The area is also much more exaggerated owing to the increased sensitivity.

<text>David Outlaw (September 14, 1806 – October 22, 1868) was a Whig U.S. Congressman representing the Albemarle district of North Carolina between 1847 and 1853.

Born near Windsor, North Carolina in 1806, Outlaw attended private schools and academies in Bertie County. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1824, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1825, opening a practice in Windsor.

A member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1831 to 1834, Outlaw was a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1835.

From 1836 to 1844, Outlaw was solicitor of the first judicial district in North Carolina. In 1844, he was nominated at the Whig National Convention as their candidate for the 29th United States Congress but Outlaw was defeated in the general election. He ran again and won two years later, subsequently serving in the 30th, 31st, and 32nd U.S. Congresses (March 4, 1847 – March 3, 1853). Outlaw was renominated by the Whigs in 1852 to compete for his seat in the 33rd Congress but was defeated in the general election by his Democratic opponent, Henry Marchmore Shaw.

Outlaw returned to state politics, serving Bertie County in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1854 to 1860, and the North Carolina Senate in 1860 and 1866. He ran for the Senate in 1862 and 1864 but lost in each election.

Outlaw, running for the North Carolina Senate in 1864, assured voters that he would support the re-election of Governor Zebulon Baird Vance and seek peace with the North based on Southern Independence. If elected, he would also oppose a convention, &quot;believing it to be a trick, by which North Carolina was to be withdrawn from the Confederacy.&quot;

Outlaw served as a colonel in the Bertie County regiment of the North Carolina state militia.

Outlaw died in Windsor, where he is buried in the Episcopal Cemetery.

Outlaw was the son of Raphael Outlaw and the cousin of US Congressman and North Carolina State Senator George Outlaw.

<text>The 5-UCO (5-Unit Controlled) was an on-line one-time tape Vernam cipher encryption system developed by the UK during World War II for use on teleprinter circuits. During the 1950s, it was used by the UK and the US for liaison on cryptanalysis.

5-UCO was fully synchronous, and therefore could be electrically regenerated on tandem high frequency (HF) radio links (i.e. one link connected to the next). It could operate directly with commercial circuits. The system also provided traffic-flow security (TFS). Another feature of the 5-UCO was that the receiving operator could maintain synchronisation if the path delay suddenly changed by &quot;walking up and down&quot; the key tape (one character at a time or one bit at a time). This procedure avoided the cumbersome task of a restart. 

5-UCO required large amounts of key tape to operate on a continual basis. In 1960, supplying the key tape for a single 5-UCO in continuous use cost £5000 per year (). In the US, the logistical problems involved in the generation, supply and destruction of sufficient quantities of key tape limited its use to only the most sensitive traffic. The Army Security Agency sought to develop a replacement, an effort later taken over by the newly formed National Security Agency and resulting in the fielding of the KW-26 (ROMULUS) system.

Colonel G. Bellairs was awarded sums totalling £2250 for the development of 5-UCO, £750 in 1943, and £1,500 in 1960. Dr G. Timms and Mr D. C. Harwood were also awarded £1,000 for work on random tape for 5-UCO.

<text>Eurodoc, the European Council for Doctoral Candidates and Junior Researchers, is an international federation of national associations of doctoral candidates and early career researchers (pre-doctoral or post-doctoral researchers employed on a temporary basis) of the European Union and the Council of Europe.

==History==
The initiative for the first conference, held in 2001, was taken by the Doktorandnämnden of Uppsala Student Union, who organized the conference together with SweDoc, i.e. the Swedish association of doctoral candidates. Eurodoc was subsequently founded in Girona, Spain on 2 February 2002. Eurodoc was legally established in 2005 in Brussels as an international non-profit organisation.

In a meeting of ministers responsible for higher education in Berlin in 2003, doctoral programmes were first mentioned in the Bologna Process setting. Since then, Eurodoc has been playing an active role in pertinent Bologna seminars and projects. Its involvement in the Bologna Process has been formally acknowledged in 2007 by the formal status of &quot;partner&quot; to the Bologna Process follow-up group. In addition, Eurodoc has been involved and provided input for the European Higher Education Area and the European Research Area.

=== Eurodoc Conferences and Annual General Meetings ===

Each year (generally in spring), Eurodoc convenes an international conference. This conference aims to provide a framework for doctoral candidates and junior researchers to meet with European political and economic leaders and to engage in a fruitful discussion on the construction of the European Research and Higher Education Area. Conferences are usually followed by an Annual General Meeting (AGM), Eurodoc&#x27;s highest decision-making body.

==== Conference &amp; AGM 2021 in Prague, Czech Republic ====
The Eurodoc Conference 2021 was held in Prague on 14–15 July 2021 in a hybrid form to bring together as many people as the pandemic situation allowed while streaming it online. The event was organised by the Committee for Doctoral Education under the Student Chamber of the Council of Higher Education Institutions (SK RVŠ) from the Czech Republic and Eurodoc. The conference focused on the quality and appropriate conditions of doctoral training and career development with the title: &quot;Improving Doctoral Training in Europe.&quot;

==== Conference &amp; AGM 2020 in Warsaw, Poland (Online) ====
The Eurodoc 2020 conference took place on 22–23 July 2020. It was the first online Eurodoc Conference in history. Due to the epidemic, organisers were obliged to change the date and form of the conference. The event was organised by Krajowa Reprezentacja Doktorantów (KRD) and Eurodoc with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education Republic of Poland. The topic of the conference was &quot;Open Up Your Science!&quot; 

==Members and observers==
There are 29 member organisations representing young researchers from 26 countries of the European Union and the Council of Europe. These are the members which conduct Eurodoc&#x27;s decisions. In addition, contributions to Eurodoc&#x27;s activities also include observers as national representatives.

==Objectives==
Eurodoc envisions a European Research Area and European Higher Education Area in which doctoral candidates and junior researchers are duly recognised and respected for the essential roles they play in the research community. Eurodoc seeks to represent and consolidate the community of doctoral candidates and junior researchers in Europe in their pursuit of a dignified career and a worthy professional life.

As a volunteer, non-profit organisation, Eurodoc monitors the situation of early career researchers in Europe with respect to different parameters (e.g. mobility, working conditions, employment opportunities, career paths, doctoral supervision and training).

Eurodoc issues policy statements and provides recommendations to academic, corporate and governing institutions on subjects of special relevance to European doctoral candidates and junior researchers (e.g., the Bologna Process or the Lisbon Strategy). In this activity, Eurodoc is in regular contact with major stakeholders in European research and higher education policy, most notably with the Directorate-General for Research (European Commission), and the European University Association.

The first Eurodoc Survey was conducted from December 2008 until May 2011. It analysed the current situation of 7561 doctoral candidates in twelve countries (Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden), and provided input for policy recommendations at the European level.

<text>Ashim Chatterjee (born 1944) is an Indian politician and a former Naxalite leader. He was a student of the then Presidency College, Kolkata, and leader of firstly Bengal Provincial Student&#x27;s Federation (then student wing of Communist Party of India (Marxist)) and then student leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) in Calcutta. Chatterjee broke ranks with Charu Majumdar in 1971 after the failure of the attempts to build an armed movement in the Debra-Gopiballavbur area in West Bengal and due to the opposition of CPI(ML) towards the liberation struggle of Bangladesh. He was imprisoned during 1972–78. Chatterjee formed the Bengal-Bihar-Odisha Border Regional Committee, CPI(ML) as a separate faction. His group joined the CPI(ML) of Satyanarayan Singh. Later Chatterjee formed the Communist Revolutionary League of India.

He unsuccessfully contested West Bengal legislative assembly (Bidhan Sabha) elections twice - first as a Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) supported Independent and in 2006, as a Trinamool Congress supported candidate. He is popularly called as comrade &quot;Kaka&quot;.

<doc id="1198711" wikidata="Q6178339" url="?curid=1198711" title="Jennifer Garrison">
<text>Jennifer Garrison (born April 2, 1962) is an American politician of the Democratic party from Marietta, Ohio. From 2005 to 2010 she represented the 93rd District in the Ohio House of Representatives, which includes Guernsey, Monroe and Noble counties, most of Washington County, and part of Muskingum County, all in southeast Ohio.

On August 3, 2009, Garrison announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Ohio Secretary of State. Garrison withdrew from the Ohio Secretary of State race in January 2010. She resigned from the State House in November 2010 to take the position of Commissioner of the Ohio State Employment Relations Board. Her nomination, a recess appointment by outgoing Democratic Governor Ted Strickland, was rejected by the Republican-majority Ohio Senate less than a month later. She declared her candidacy for Ohio&#x27;s 6th congressional district in the 2014 election on 12 July 2013.

==Biography==
Jennifer Garrison was born in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, the daughter of a union plumber. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and business administration from Xavier University, and a J.D. degree from Catholic University Law School in Washington, D.C. While in college, she worked as an intern for the Congressional Budget Office, and for the Ohio Department of Transportation and Ohio Department of Natural Resources as a legislative assistant in Washington.

Garrison then completed a judicial clerkship in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and became a practicing attorney. She moved to Marietta in 1990, joining the law firm of McCauley, Webster &amp; Emrick, where she became a partner in 1993. Three years later, she opened a private law practice, concentrating on family mediation. She ran the Washington County Visitation Mediation Project for seven years, providing free mediation to parents working out their custody and visitation conflicts. She has served on the boards of the domestic violence shelter EVE and the Washington County Mental Health &amp; Alcohol Addiction Board, and as Commissioner on the Marietta Civil Service Board.

Garrison is licensed to practice law in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. She served as president of the Washington County, Ohio Bar Association from 1996 to 1997.

==Ohio House of Representatives==
In 2004, Garrison beat incumbent representative Nancy P. Hollister with 51.6% of the vote. Garrison campaigned as a conservative Democrat who supported a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages.

In 2006, Garrison was reelected with 71% of the vote against Republican challenger Donald J. Gadd, mayor of Byesville, Ohio. She served as Ranking Member of the Juvenile and Family Law Committee, and on the Education, Ranking Member on Public Utilities and Energy, and Finance and Appropriations Committees and the Primary and Secondary Education Subcommittee.

She won reelection in 2008 with 68% of the vote against Republican Wayne Smith. In 2009 she was elected by her peers as Majority Floor Leader in the Ohio House of Representatives.

In 2011, Garrison established the Southeastern Ohio Landowners Association (SEOLA), a not-for profit, association to assist mineral owners in the collective negotiation of oil and gas leases for the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations. As legal counsel for SEOLA, Garrison successfully negotiated leases on approximately 100,000 mineral acres in 13 lease transactions with 6 different companies. This work was recognized in the New York Times June 5, 2012 edition.

In 2014, Garrison ran unsuccessfully for the Ohio&#x27;s 6th Congressional District Representative seat against incumbent Bill Johnson.

<doc id="1198712" wikidata="Q3551335" url="?curid=1198712" title="University Avenue (Toronto)">
<text>University Avenue is a major north–south road in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Beginning at Front Street West in the south, the thoroughfare heads north to end at College Street just south of Queen&#x27;s Park. At its north end, the Ontario Legislative Building serves as a prominent terminating vista. Many of Toronto&#x27;s most important institutions are located along the eight-lane wide street such as Osgoode Hall and other legal institutions, the Four Seasons Centre, major hospitals conducting research and teaching, and landmark office buildings for the commercial sector, notably major financial and insurance industry firms. The portion of University Avenue between Queen Street West and College Street is laid out as a boulevard, with several memorials, statues, gardens, and fountains concentrated in a landscaped median dividing the opposite directions of travel, giving it a ceremonial character. Despite its name, the University of Toronto is not located on University Avenue but instead on neighboring St. George Street.

==Route description==

University Avenue begins at the intersection of Front and York streets near Union Station and heads northwest for a short distance before turning north. Lanes on the left ends as ramp to underground parking garage. At Adelaide Street West, the avenue divides slightly, leaving room for a median of greenery and sculptures between the north and southbound lanes. Southbound University runs diagonally to meet with York Street at Front Street West then continues south as York Street to Queens Quay and ends as a driveway signed as Harbour Square.

The avenue ends at College Street, where it splits into Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent East (northbound) and Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent West (southbound). Between these two roads is Queen&#x27;s Park, the home of the Ontario Legislative Building. This landmark creates a terminating vista for those looking north along University. The legislature&#x27;s site was originally home to the main building of the University of Toronto, and this is the origin of the avenue&#x27;s name. Today, the university surrounds the legislature building. Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent is a single street north to Bloor Street.

North of Bloor Street, the road continues as Avenue Road. University Avenue and Avenue Road were once designated as Highway 11A.

While Yonge Street is the emotional heart of the city and Bay Street the financial hub, University Avenue is Toronto&#x27;s most ceremonial thoroughfare, with many of the city&#x27;s most prominent institutions. The boulevard is unusually wide for Canadian cities (except for Winnipeg), as it expands from 6 lanes wide (just past the jog at Front and York streets) to eight lanes wide (just past the divide past Adelaide Street). The speed limit is 40 km/h below Gerrard St, reduced from 50 km/h. The speed limit was reduced from 60 to 50 in May–June 2009.

The northernmost part of the street is dominated by a series of hospitals including Toronto General Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, and The Hospital for Sick Children. The concentration of hospitals on this portion of the street has led to it being given the nickname &quot;Hospital Row&quot; by locals and the media. The intersection of University and College is also home to the headquarters of Ontario Power Generation.

The rest of the street is home to a variety of corporate offices and government buildings. Historically, this imposing street has been met with mixed reviews. Noted Canadian author and historian Pierre Berton commented that University Avenue &quot;was rendered antiseptic by the presence of hospitals and insurance offices...the pristine display of wall-to-wall concrete that ran from Front Street to Queen&#x27;s Park.&quot;

University Avenue has matured and mellowed somewhat since Berton&#x27;s unfavourable observation, though paving is still characterized by poured concrete and asphalt for most sidewalks and roadway. Restaurants now dot the southern end of University Avenue. The Four Seasons Centre at the intersection of University Avenue and Queen Street was completed in 2006 and is the home of the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Osgoode Hall presents stately architecture and a welcome green space. During the holiday season, festive lights illuminate the trees and shrubs of the boulevard. Unlike most major streets in Toronto, there are no rooftop billboards visible from University Avenue due to a bylaw.

A portion of the University line portion of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line runs the length of University Avenue.

==History==

University Avenue was originally made up of two streets, College Avenue and University Street, and separated by a fence, but it was eventually removed and the streets were merged. The merged street ended at Queen Street until 1931, when it was extended southward to Front Street.

After World War Two the avenue was transformed. Trees were cut down and four lanes, in each direction, were devoted to cars and trucks. A central median has some trees, monuments, and park benches, which are lightly used, because strollers are surrounded by noisy traffic.

=== Bike lane installation ===

As part of the City of Toronto’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of temporary dedicated bike lanes were installed across Toronto in 2020, including on University Avenue. These lanes, from Bloor Street to King Street were made permanent in 2021.

The current premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, has introduced legislation to remove these bike lanes over the wishes of the city. 

==Future==

In 2020 the city changed how lanes were allocated on University Avenue&#x27;s pavement. Only two lanes, per direction, were devoted to cars and trucks. A lane was devoted to parking, and room was made for a bicycle lane.

According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; it has been proposed to return approximately half of the width of the broad avenue to parkland. The of parkland would cost $230 million, compared with the anticipated $1.7 billion cost for the proposed Rail Deck Park&#x27;s . The park would extend from the Royal Ontario Museum, at Bloor Street, to the green space that surround Osgoode Hall, on Queen Street. When the greenspace around Osgoode Hall, and adjacent Nathan Phillips Square, and Queen&#x27;s Park, surrounding the legislature are counted, University Avenue Park would connect of greenspace and public space.

The plans include restoring a section of Taddle Creek that once flowed beside University Avenue.

<doc id="1198718" wikidata="Q1899781" url="?curid=1198718" title="DreamWorks Records">
<text>DreamWorks Records (often referred in copyright notices as SKG Music, LLC) was an American record label founded in 1996 by Mo Ostin, his son Michael Ostin and Lenny Waronker as a subsidiary of DreamWorks Pictures. The label operated until 2004 when it was sold to Universal Music Group. The label itself also featured a Nashville, Tennessee-based subsidiary, DreamWorks Nashville, which specialized in country music and was shut down in 2006 then moved to MCA Nashville. The company&#x27;s logo was designed by Roy Lichtenstein and was his last commission before his death in 1997.

== History ==
In October 1994, four years after David Geffen sold his former record label Geffen Records to MCA Music Entertainment, he joined Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg to form DreamWorks SKG. SKG stood for Spielberg, Katzenberg &amp; Geffen. The three partners, mainly Geffen along with Mo Ostin, his son Michael and Lenny Waronker later launched the subsidiary record label DreamWorks Records in early 1996. Rufus Wainwright was the first artist to be signed to the new record label, in early 1996.

The logo for the label was the last project completed by artist Roy Lichtenstein. The distinctive design, incorporating a musical note in the artist&#x27;s trademark &quot;dream balloon,&quot; debuted on the packaging for &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot;, the first album from Los Angeles-based band Eels, and the second release from the record company. The record label&#x27;s first release, George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Older&quot; album, had featured DreamWorks Pictures&#x27; logo of a boy fishing and sitting on a moon crescent.

Henry Rollins (both as a spoken-word artist and with Rollins Band), Tamar Braxton, Nelly Furtado, George Michael, Randy Newman, Morphine, Elliott Smith, Eels, comedian/actor Chris Rock, Powerman 5000, Papa Roach and others were also signed to the label. The label was presided over by Lenny Waronker and Mo Ostin -- who ran Warner Bros. Records until the mid-1990s -- and Michael Ostin, who served as the president of DreamWorks. Ostin stated at the time: &quot;What you find in the record business is there is more and more a trend toward corporate control, corporate values, and here you’re dealing with a creatively oriented operation.&quot;

Geffen Records distributed DreamWorks Records until 1999, when Interscope Records took over distribution duties (meanwhile, as Interscope and Geffen switched international distribution to Polydor Records, DreamWorks Records followed suit). It was announced on November 11, 2003, that Universal Music Group (the former MCA Music Entertainment, and parent of Interscope, Geffen, and Polydor) reached an agreement to acquire DreamWorks Records from DreamWorks for &quot;about $100 million&quot;. The purchase came at a time when the music business was &quot;going through major changes&quot; as it struggled to &quot;counter falling sales and the impact of unofficial online music sales&quot;. Mo Ostin, the principal executive at DreamWorks Records, said: &quot;Despite the challenges of the music business today, Universal is acquiring a wonderful asset and the sale will assure the strongest possible future for our artists&quot;. Under the new deal, DreamWorks Records was placed within the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M label, under the direction of Jimmy Iovine. After the finalisation of the label&#x27;s sale to UMG on January 9, 2004, 100 employees were laid off at DreamWorks, multiple bands were dropped, and several albums were cancelled as it was folded into Geffen Records. Notably, the label&#x27;s A&amp;R staff were kept on to the label. Polly Anthony joined Jordan Schur as Geffen co-head in 2004.

Its country music division, DreamWorks Nashville, which began in June 1997, remained operational until September 1, 2005, when it was shut down by Universal Music Group Nashville following the departure of the label&#x27;s biggest star, Toby Keith.

== DreamWorks Nashville ==
Between 1997 and 2005, DreamWorks also operated a division in Nashville, Tennessee for country music acts. Among the artists signed to the DreamWorks Nashville division were Jessica Andrews, Emerson Drive, Toby Keith, Mike Walker, Randy Travis, Jimmy Wayne, and Darryl Worley. After DreamWorks Records&#x27; dissolution, former executive Scott Borchetta formed Big Machine Records in late 2005, signing several country music acts to the label. Borchetta also signed Show Dog Records in partnership with Toby Keith, although Keith dropped his association with the latter label in 2005. Meanwhile, Borchetta signed Taylor Swift to Big Machine Records. The latter label merged with Universal South Records to become Show Dog-Universal Music.

<text>Kevin DeWine (born October 11, 1967) is an American businessman and politician who chaired the Ohio Republican Party from 2009 until 2012. Previously, he was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 2001 to 2009.

DeWine graduated from Fairborn High School in 1986, received his Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from the University of Dayton in 1990, and earned an MBA from Wright State University in 1996. The DeWine family resides in Fairborn, Ohio. Before holding public office, Kevin was a regional development manager for the Dayton Power and Light Company. He is the second cousin of R. Michael DeWine, who currently serves as Governor of Ohio.

When Steve Austria vacated his seat to run for the Ohio Senate, DeWine was elected to represent the 76th district in the Ohio House in 2000, defeating Democrat Eric Marcus and independent candidate Christina Turner, winning 62.3% of the vote. In 2002, in the 70th district after redistricting, he defeated Democrat Lawrence Gordon
with 71.7% of the vote. He faced Gordon again in 2004, DeWine won with 69.3% of the vote.

In 2006, DeWine won his fourth term with 60.4% of the vote against Democrat Kevin O&#x27;Brien. DeWine was elected Speaker pro tempore in the 127th Ohio General Assembly. He was the chair of the Rules and Reference committee, and also serves on the Finance &amp; Appropriations and the State Government &amp; Elections Committees. He was not eligible to run for a fifth term due to term limits.

On January 16, 2009, he was elected unanimously as chairman of the Republican Party of Ohio. He was reelected as chairman in 2011. He was replaced in April 2012 by Robert T. Bennett, following DeWine&#x27;s resignation over disputes with Ohio Governor John Kasich.

<text>Adibhatla Kailasam was an Indian communist leader. Kailasam was one of the original leaders of the Srikakulam peasant uprising. Kailasam came from a landlord family of Kaarivalasa village in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh. He joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) and he was elected to its central committee at the party congress in 1970.

Kailasam was a school teacher by profession. In the early 1960s, Kailasam and his colleague Satyanaraya, began to organise tribal peasants in the Srikakulam area. State authorities began to register criminal cases against the two, and they decided to go into hiding. On 7 July 1970, Kailasam and Satyanarayan were captured by police. They were later shot dead around 10–11 July.

<text>C. G. Conn Ltd., Conn Instruments or commonly just Conn, is a former American manufacturer of musical instruments incorporated in 1915. It bought the production facilities owned by Charles Gerard Conn, a major figure in early manufacture of brasswinds and saxophones in the USA. Its early business was based primarily on brass instruments, which were manufactured in Elkhart, Indiana. During the 1950s the bulk of its sales revenue shifted to electric organs. In 1969 the company was sold in bankruptcy to the Crowell-Collier-MacMillan publishing company. Conn was divested of its Elkhart production facilities in 1970, leaving remaining production in satellite facilities and contractor sources.

The company was sold in 1980 and then again in 1985, reorganized under the parent corporation United Musical Instruments (UMI) in 1986. The assets of UMI were bought by Steinway Musical Instruments in 2000 and in January 2003 were merged with other Steinway properties into a subsidiary called Conn-Selmer. C. G. Conn survived as a brand of musical instruments manufactured by Conn-Selmer, retaining several instruments for which it was known: the Conn 8D horn, 88H trombone, 62H bass trombone, 52BSP trumpet and the 1FR flugelhorn.

==History==

===Company origins===
Charles G. Conn was a Civil War veteran of the U.S. Army who, after the war, established a grocery and baking business in Elkhart, Indiana. He also played cornet in the local community band. Conn&#x27;s entrance into the musical instrument manufacturing business was the result of a split lip. There are three existing stories of how this occurred, but the popularly accepted version is that Del Crampton slugged him in the mouth outside a saloon where both of them had been drinking. Conn&#x27;s upper lip was severely lacerated, and it pained him so to play his cornet that he thought his playing days were over. In addition to running his store, Conn also made rubber stamps and re-plated silverware. He decided to try adhering rubber stamp material to the rim of a mouthpiece which he hoped would conform to his lips. After he showed his friends his idea, he realized that there was tremendous demand for his invention. Conn then began to contemplate manufacturing his new mouthpiece. He needed a rim with a groove which the rubber cement would adhere to more easily. It was in 1874 when Conn converted a discarded sewing machine frame into a simple lathe and started to turn out his mouthpieces and was soon in full production (Subsequently, Conn and Del Crampton became best of friends, and when Conn embarked on his political career, he was a staunch advocate of temperance). Conn patented his rubber-rimmed mouthpiece in 1875 (with patents to follow through 1877) described as &quot;an elastic face [i.e., a rubber rim] where the mouthpiece comes in contact with the lips, the object being to prevent fatigue and injury to the lips.&quot;

===Growth of Conn&#x27;s musical instrument business===
Conn met Eugene Victor Baptiste Dupont, a brass instrument maker and designer and a former employee of Henry Distin of London. In January 1876, Conn joined with Dupont under the name of Conn &amp; Dupont, and Dupont created Conn&#x27;s first instrument, the Four-in-One cornet, with crooks allowing the horn to be played in the keys of E♭, C, B♭, and A. By 1877, Conn&#x27;s business had outgrown the back of his grocery store, and he purchased an idle factory building on the corner of Elkhart Avenue and East Jackson. Conn&#x27;s partnership with Dupont was dissolved by March 1879, but he was successful in attracting skilled craftsmen from Europe to his factory, and in this manner he expanded his operation so that by 1905, Conn had the world&#x27;s largest musical instrument factory producing a full line of wind instruments, strings, percussion, and a portable organ. Conn partnered with Albert T. Armstrong, Joseph Jones, and Emory Foster to manufacture a twin-horn disc phonograph called the &#x27;Double-Bell Wonder&#x27; that was produced in two iterations briefly in early 1898 before a lawsuit by the Berliner Gramophone Company caused production to cease. Brick-red &#x27;Wonder&#x27; records were also pressed for the &#x27;Double-Bell Wonder&#x27; talking machine by the Scranton Button Works from pirated Berliner masters. Fewer than fifty &#x27;Double-Bell Wonders&#x27; were produced of both iterations combined.

Conn&#x27;s first factory was destroyed by fire on January 29, 1883 (his thirty-ninth birthday), and he erected a new building on the same site. In 1886 rumors began to circulate that Conn wanted to move his business to Massachusetts. Conn was induced to stay after the public raised a large sum of money by popular subscription and gave it to him. In 1887 Conn purchased Isaac Fiske&#x27;s brass instrument manufactory in Worcester, Massachusetts upon Fiske&#x27;s retirement. Fiske&#x27;s operation was considered to be the best in its time. Conn operated it as a company subsidiary, and in this way he achieved his objectives. The company&#x27;s product line now centered on the &#x27;Wonder&#x27; cornet, but in 1885 Conn began importing French clarinets and flutes. Conn started production of the first American-made saxophone in 1888, after being shown an Adolphe Sax saxophone by his employee Ferdinand August Buescher and agreeing to produce a copy of it. That instrument belonged to Edward A. Lefebre, a well known soloist with both Patrick Gilmore&#x27;s and John Philip Sousa&#x27;s bands. After working on prototypes with advice from Lefebre, Conn settled on production models of saxophones and started regular production around 1892. Conn&#x27;s instruments were endorsed by several leading band directors, including Sousa. In 1898, upon the suggestion of Sousa, Conn developed the first commercially successful bell-up sousaphone (&quot;the rain-catcher&quot;). Conn phased out the Worcester operation (production was ceased in 1898), and Conn established a store in New York City (1897–1902) that sold a large variety of merchandise under the &#x27;Wonder&#x27; label, including Conn-made woodwind, brass and percussion instruments, violins, mandolins and portable reed organs. The business also distributed American-made and imported guitars, banjos and zithers.

Conn&#x27;s marketing included not only sales of instruments but promotion of brass bands. He founded the Conn Conservatory to train the brass instrument teachers who would be a vital component in the growth of the musical instrument industry. During the 1890s E.A. Lefebre started teaching saxophone at the Conservatory, which provided a boost to the availability of saxophone instruction and the following growth of saxophone sales into the twentieth century.

Conn&#x27;s company was a source of competitors as well as instruments. Notable employees who left the firm to pursue their own businesses were composer W. Paris Chambers, the founder of the Seidel Band Instrument Company William F. Seidel, the founder of the Buescher Band Instrument Company Ferdinand A. Buescher, the founder of the F.E. Olds Company Frank E. Olds, and the founder of the Martin Band Instrument Company Henry Charles Martin.

Conn&#x27;s second factory burned on 22 May 1910, a loss estimated between $100,000 and $500,000. Conn was en route from California to Elkhart when his factory burned, and upon arriving home he was met with a public demonstration, a way of showing popular sympathy. Conn then announced his intentions to build a third factory on the corner of East Beardsley and Conn Avenues. Construction began 15 August 1910, and by the following 12 December it was fully operational.

===Conn&#x27;s other enterprises===
Conn&#x27;s career grew well beyond the realm of musical instrument manufacturing. In 1892 he was elected to the United States Congress, in 1908 he ran for Governor of Indiana and lost, and in 1910 he ran for Senator. In 1889, Conn founded the &quot;Elkhart Daily Truth&quot;, published the monthly &quot;Trumpet Notes&quot; and a scandal sheet called &quot;The Gossip&quot;, and purchased &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, which he later sold. After a failed entry into the utilities business, the building of his third factory (and its loss to fire), and his loss of a costly lawsuit filed against him by a former company manager, Conn had amassed significant debts. In 1911, in an effort to bond Conn&#x27;s debts and secure working capital, Conn and his wife executed a trust deed for $200,000 covering not only the horn factory, but all their possessions, with the longest bond to mature in ten years. Conn&#x27;s growing debt crisis forced him to seek a buyer for his assets, and in 1915 all of Conn&#x27;s holdings, including the horn factory, were bought by a group of investors led by Carl Dimond Greenleaf, whom Conn had met during his years in Washington, D.C.

===Carl D. Greenleaf and C. G. Conn, Ltd., 1915–1949===
Carl Greenleaf was president of Conn from 1915 to 1949. The new company was incorporated with public stock offerings under the name C. G. Conn Ltd. and the Conn trademark was updated to the official name of the new company. Greenleaf was an astute businessman, very sensitive to the market trends of the industry. While president, Greenleaf was noting the gradual extinction of the small town brass band, and of the big touring bands such as the Sousa band. To shore up the future market for band instruments, he undertook to promote band programs in schools and colleges. He proceeded to develop a close relationship and communications between the industry and music educators. His collaboration with educators such as Joseph E. Maddy and T.P. Giddings helped introduce band music into public schools. Greenleaf organized the first national band contest in 1923 and helped make possible the founding of the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. In 1928 he founded a Conn National School of Music which trained hundreds of school band directors, and this in turn helped spur the development of music programs in schools and communities across the United States.

Under Greenleaf&#x27;s leadership the company converted distribution from mail-order to retail dealers and expanded its product line through acquisitions. C. G. Conn founded the Continental Music retail subsidiary in 1923 which, at the height of its success, included a chain of over 30 music stores. During the 1920s C. G. Conn owned the Elkhart Band Instrument Company (1923–27), the Leedy Company (1929–55), a manufacturer of percussion, and 49.9% of the stock of the retailer H. &amp; A. Selmer (1923–27). Conn purchased the drum manufacturer Ludwig and Ludwig, the instrument import/retail operation of the Carl Fischer company, and accordion manufacturer Soprani in 1929. From 1940 to 1950 the company owned the Haddorff Piano Company, and from 1941 to 1942 the Straube Piano Company.

Greenleaf expanded and upgraded C. G. Conn&#x27;s plant to increase production and developed new lines of wind instruments to sell. By 1917, using a new hydraulic expansion process which Greenleaf introduced to the plant, the assembly-line work force had increased to 550 employees who were turning out about 2500 instruments a month. In 1917 C. G. Conn introduced the &quot;Pan American&quot; brand for its second-line instruments, forming the Pan American Band Instrument Company subsidiary in 1919 and moving production of second-line instruments to the old Angledile Scale factory, which had been transferred to the new company among Conn&#x27;s other assets, later that year. In 1930 the Pan American company was absorbed by C. G. Conn, with C. G. Conn retaining and utilizing the Pan American brand for its second-line instruments until 1955.

By 1920 C. G. Conn was producing a complete line of saxophones. In this area they had stiff competition from other big saxophone makers such as Buescher and Martin. Around 1917 C.G. Conn introduced drawn tone holes (after a patent by W.S. Haynes in 1914) eliminating the necessity of soft-soldering tone hole platforms onto the bodies of the instruments. Around 1920 C. G. Conn introduced rolled tone hole rims, a feature that enhanced the seal of the pads and extended pad life. Rolled tone holes remained a feature of Conn saxophones until 1947. By the late 1920s the success of Conn&#x27;s latest &quot;New Wonder&quot; model saxophones with dance orchestras was gaining widespread attention, leading European manufacturers to produce horns closer to the deeper, richer, bolder &quot;American&quot; sound. Selmer (Paris) introduced the American-sounding &quot;New Largebore&quot; model in 1929 and the new Julius Keilwerth Company in Czechoslovakia produced saxophones influenced by the C. G. Conn design, including rolled tone holes and microtuners. As sax sales plateaued in 1928, Conn attempted to introduce a mezzo-soprano saxophone in the key of F and the &quot;Conn-o-sax&quot;, a saxophone-English horn hybrid, but these instruments were soon discontinued after disappointing sales.

In 1928, under the direction of Carl Greenleaf&#x27;s son Leland Burleigh Greenleaf, C. G. Conn opened its Experimental Laboratory, which was unique in the industry. Under Leland Greenleaf&#x27;s directorship, the department developed the first short-action piston valves (1934), and the &#x27;Stroboconn&#x27; (1936), the first electronic visual tuning device. It also developed the &quot;Vocabell&quot; (1932), a bell with no rim, which C. G. Conn described as &quot;vibrat[ing] freely and in sympathy with the vibrating column of air in the instrument,&quot; C. G. Conn also developed the &quot;Coprion&quot; bell (1934), a seamless copper bell formed by directly electroplating it onto a mandrel. Under Greenleaf&#x27;s saxophone specialists Allen Loomis and Hugh Loney, C. G. Conn&#x27;s research and development resulted in the designs of the 6M alto (1931), 10M tenor (1934), and 12M baritone (1930). The 12M baritone was the first saxophone with both bell keys on the right side, followed by the King Voll-True II (1932) and Selmer Balanced Action (1936). The 6M alto featured an innovative double socket neck that eliminated the large collar on the body tube at the neck joint for a more positive seal and even response, later adopted for King altos and tenors. From 1935 through 1943, C. G. Conn produced the 26M and 30M &quot;Connqueror&quot; alto and tenor saxophones, featuring screw-adjustable keywork and improved mechanisms for the left hand cluster. The keywork was the most fully adjustable of any saxophone during that period. C. G. Conn&#x27;s laboratory was expanded into the Division of Research, Development and Design in 1940, directed by Earle Kent. C. G. Conn&#x27;s combined abilities in close-tolerance manufacturing and electronic devices made them a valuable resource for wartime production.

From mid-1942 to 1945, C. G. Conn ceased all production of musical instruments for civilian use to manufacture flat &amp; mounted compasses, altimeters, gyro-horizon indicators, and other military instrumentation. A special application of C. G. Conn&#x27;s &quot;Coprion&quot; process—creating seamless brass bells by depositing copper on a mandrel—was to manufacture silver bearing inserts for the Wright Cyclone airplane engines. In winter 1946–47, production was again interrupted, by a 15-week labor strike. The loss in sales from those disruptions and increased competition from other manufacturers such as Selmer (Paris) and King (H. N. White) caused a serious decline in C. G. Conn&#x27;s status as a major band instrument manufacturer. The company first responded by expanding their lines of electronic musical products, developing the &quot;Connsonata&quot; electronic organ in 1946. They later introduced the &quot;Connstellation&quot; model wind instruments to revitalize those product lines (28M alto saxophone with help from Santy Runyon, 1948, and brass instruments, mid-1950s). The Connstellation brasswinds remained a premium line through the 1960s.

===The Paul Gazlay – Lee Greenleaf era, 1949–1969===

Carl Greenleaf retired in 1949 but remained a member of the C. G. Conn board of directors until his death in 1959. He was succeeded by Paul Gazlay. In 1958, Lee Greenleaf succeeded Gazlay as company President. C. G. Conn briefly returned to the manufacture of military instrumentation during the Korean War, while continuing production of musical instruments. Priorities changed under Gazlay, with the high-quality wind instruments on which the company had built its reputation becoming an increasingly marginal interest. The 28M saxophone was discontinued after 1952 and cost-cutting measures were incorporated into the manufacturing process and designs of Conn&#x27;s 6M, 10M, and 12M &quot;Artist&quot; series saxophones. C. G. Conn shifted their emphasis to the expanding market for school band instruments and to diversifying their instrument lines. In 1956, C. G. Conn sponsored a film to promote school bands entitled &quot;Mr. B Natural&quot;. To diversify their product line, C. G. Conn acquired as subsidiaries the New Berlin Instrument Company (1954) of New Berlin, New York which produced clarinets, oboes and bassoons for Conn, the Artley Company (1959), a manufacturer of flutes and clarinets, the Janssen Piano Company (1964), and the Scherl &amp; Roth Company (1964), a manufacturer of stringed instruments. C.G. Conn divested itself of Leedy and Ludwig in 1955, Carl Fischer retail in 1959, and New Berlin Instrument in 1961. By 1958, over half of C.G. Conn&#x27;s sales revenue was from their electric organs. In 1959 C. G. Conn built a new organ factory in Madison, Indiana. The Janssen Piano assets were merged with C. G. Conn&#x27;s organ division to form Conn Keyboards in 1964.

In 1960, C. G. Conn acquired the Art Best Manufacturing Company (Coin Art) facility that manufactured saxophones in Nogales, Arizona. They continued manufacturing saxophones of the Vito design that were produced there, marketed as the Conn 50M and 60M alto and tenor saxophones, then moved the production of their 14M and 16M student alto and tenor saxophones to the facility in 1963. Production of other wind instruments remained in Elkhart.

The late 1960s saw trends in the keyboard, wind, and stringed instrument markets that were seriously undermining C. G. Conn&#x27;s position. The growing popularity of portable electronic keyboards was cutting into C. G. Conn&#x27;s niche of home organs and pianos. The market for student instruments was becoming increasingly competitive, with newcomers from Japan offering products more efficiently produced, with higher quality standards, and more tailored to students&#x27; needs. Conn saxophones had ceased to be competitive in the professional market during the 1950s due to outdated designs and declining quality. By the late 1960s, their student line instruments were in competitive decline for similar reasons. In an effort to respond to the uprising of electronics Conn tried to also explore market possibilities in these areas and released in 1967 the Conn Multi÷Vider, an electronic device for using on saxophones similar to an octaver. Even though the device achieved some popularity with Jazz artists, like e.g. Tom Scott using it on some of his early recordings, it didn&#x27;t stop the decline of the company. By 1969, C. G. Conn, Ltd. was facing insolvency.

===Company from 1969 to 2003===
In 1969 C. G. Conn, Ltd. was sold under bankruptcy to the Crowell-Collier MacMillan Company. In 1970, the corporate offices were moved to Oak Brook, Illinois, Conn Keyboards was moved to Carol Stream, Illinois and their piano manufacturing operation sold. The same year, G. C. Conn&#x27;s Elkhart manufacturing facilities were sold to Selmer (USA) and Coachmen Industries. Brasswind manufacturing moved to Abilene, Texas and woodwind production was moved from Nogales, Arizona to Nogales, Mexico. A precipitous drop in product quality followed those moves, initiated as cost-cutting measures by executives not familiar with instrument production, and destroyed whatever was left of G. C. Conn&#x27;s reputation in the wind instrument market. Conn introduced the modernized 7M alto saxophone; it soon acquired the same reputation for poor quality as the other &quot;MexiConns,&quot; sold poorly, and was discontinued. In 1970 Conn also started the Conn Guitar Division, operating out of Oak Brook, Illinois, contracting the manufacture of a new line of acoustic guitars to Tokai Gakki in Japan. G. C. Conn&#x27;s acoustic guitar business ended in 1978. In 1979 G. C. Conn tried to enter the highly competitive electric guitar market, introducing a line of some original model electric guitars, and some copies of existing popular brands. (see History of Conn Guitars).

In 1980 the company was sold to Daniel Henkin, who had served the company as an advertising manager during the 1960s. Henkin moved C. G. Conn&#x27;s corporate offices back to Elkhart and moved to refocus the company on wind instruments. First to go were the failing electric guitar venture, which was discontinued, and Conn Keyboards, sold to Kimball. Henkin hired &quot;Tonight Show&quot; trumpeter and bandleader Doc Severinsen as Vice President of Product Development, and introduced the Conn Severinsen trumpet and Henkin student clarinet. In 1981 Henkin bought the W.T. Armstrong Company, a manufacturer of flutes and marketer of &quot;H. Couf&quot; branded saxophones made by the Julius Keilwerth company of West Germany. After that acquisition, the Keilwerth instruments were also sold as &quot;Conn DJH Modified&quot; models. The company introduced a student line of oboes and bassoons under the &quot;Artley&quot; brand in 1983. The same year, Henkin acquired King Musical Instruments of Eastlake, Ohio from the defunct Seeburg Corporation&#x27;s creditors.

By 1985 Henkin was seeking a buyer for his companies, first selling the Conn Strobotuner division to Peterson Electro-Musical Products. Peterson continues to service the Conn line of tuners. The Swedish investment firm Skåne Gripen bought Henkin&#x27;s other companies and merged them in 1986 to create a new parent corporation, United Musical Instruments (UMI), headquartered in Nogales, Arizona. UMI closed the Conn Brasswind facility in Abilene, Texas (1986), moving brass instrument production to the King plant in Eastlake. All operations were moved out of Mexico in 1987. Production of &quot;Artley&quot; flutes was moved to the W. T. Armstrong facility in Elkhart, and reed instrument production was moved back from Nogales, Mexico to Nogales, Arizona.

In 1990 UMI was sold to Bernhard Muskantor, one of the Skåne Gripen partners. Muskantor, with family roots in the musical instrument business, desired a return of the Conn name to respectability, but its arrangement with Keilwerth had recently fallen apart and the increasingly tough market with new low-cost Asian competitors kept Conn&#x27;s position marginal. In 2000 UMI was purchased by Steinway Musical Instruments, and in January 2003 Steinway merged the UMI assets with their subsidiary The Selmer Company to create the Conn-Selmer division.

==Conn Res-o-Pads==

Between 1920 and 1947, all professional-grade saxophones manufactured by C. G. Conn had rolled toneholes. In the early 1930s, C. G. Conn developed a unique type of saxophone pad called &quot;Conn Res-o-Pads&quot;, which were specifically designed for use on saxophones with rolled toneholes. Conn Res-O-Pads have an internal metal reinforcing ring which is hidden under the leather covering around the circumference of the pad. Their most notable feature is that the diameter of the pad extends over the rim of the key-cup, thereby giving a slightly wider surface area for the rolled tone-hole to seal onto. Rim impressions from Res-o-Pads are minimal and unlike standard pads they cannot be &quot;floated&quot; in. Though designed to fix into key-cups purely via friction, most saxophone repairers glue them in place using shellac or hot melt adhesive. Res-o-Pads can be challenging to size correctly because (unlike standard saxophone pads which come in 0.5 mm size steps) they are only available in 1/32nds of an inch sizes which may not always correspond closely to key-cup diameters. Newly produced Conn Res-o-Pads are still available from specialist suppliers and are favored by some saxophone collectors because they give a fully authentic look and feel to vintage saxophones with rolled toneholes e.g. those made by Conn, Kohlert and Keilwerth. However, it is possible to fit standard pads to any saxophone with rolled toneholes (and many people do) without any noticeable disadvantage regarding the quality of sound produced.

==The Conn Microtuner==

From 1922 to 1950 Conn manufactured alto and c-melody saxophones with a unique tuning device on the neck known as the &quot;Conn Microtuner.&quot; The feature was devised to allow the saxophone to be tuned while maintaining optimal volume in the chamber of the mouthpiece, thus avoiding disturbance to intonation. The device adjusts the length of the neck, controlled by a threaded barrel near the mouthpiece end. To lower the pitch, the barrel was rotated to the left. To raise the pitch the barrel was rotated to the right. The benefits of the microtuner to intonation have been shown to be more theoretical than practical, with the drawbacks that the internal mechanism requires extra cleaning and maintenance and is a potential source of leaks. Some repair technicians who have play-tested large numbers of Conn altos (cf. Les Arbuckle of Saxoasis.com) report that the microtuner necks lend a different sound quality from those without one. Early Keilwerth and other German-made saxophones also featured microtuners. Since the 1950s, all new saxophones use the traditional tuning method of pulling out or pushing in the mouthpiece on the cork until the pitch is correct.

<text>David Paul Ausubel (October 25, 1918 – July 9, 2008) was an American psychologist. His most significant contribution to the fields of educational psychology, cognitive science, and science education learning was on the development and research on &quot;advance organizers&quot; (see below) since 1960.

==Biography==
===Family===
He was born on October 25, 1918, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He was nephew of the Jewish historian Nathan Ausubel. Ausubel and his wife Pearl had two children.

===Education and academic career===
Ausubel studied at the University of Pennsylvania where he graduated with honors in 1939, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree majoring in psychology. Ausubel later graduated from medical school in 1943 at Middlesex University where he went on to complete a rotating internship at Gouverneur Hospital, located in the lower east side of Manhattan, New York. Ausubel earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in developmental psychology from Columbia University in 1950. He served with the US Public Health service, worked in Germany after World War Two in the medical treatment of displaced persons and as a psychiatrist in Veterans Administration hospitals. Ausubel continued to hold a series of professorships at several schools of education, including University of Illinois (1950-1966), University of Toronto (1966-1968) and the City University of New York, where he stayed until his retirement.

===Psychiatrist=== 
In 1973, Ausubel retired from academic life and devoted himself to his psychiatric practice. During his psychiatric practice, Ausubel published many books as well as articles in psychiatric and psychological journals. In 1976, he received the Thorndike Award from the American Psychological Association for &quot;Distinguished Psychological Contributions to Education&quot;.

===Author===
In 1994, at the age of 75, Ausubel retired from professional life to devote himself full-time to writing. He then published four books:
* &quot;Ego development and Psychopathology&quot; (1996),
* &quot; The Acquisition and Retention of Knowledge&quot; (2000),
* &quot;Theory and Problems of Adolescent Development&quot; (2002), and
* &quot;Death and the Human Condition&quot; (2002), 
** In &quot;Death and the Human Condition&quot; he wrote about the psychology of death and impressed his own personal psychological, theological and philosophical thoughts on the nature and implications of the afterlife, conceptualizing death from the perspective of both Christian believers and non-believers, expressing his view that &quot;the relevance and value of faith should certainly not be derogated or treated pejoratively, as atheists, agnostics, and rationalists tend to do.&quot;

==Influences==
Ausubel was influenced by the teachings of Jean Piaget. Similar to Piaget&#x27;s ideas of conceptual schemes, Ausubel related this to his explanation of how people acquire knowledge. &quot;David Ausubel theorized that people acquire knowledge primarily by being exposed directly to it rather than through discovery&quot; (Woolfolk et al., 2010, p. 288) In other words, Ausubel believed that an understanding of concepts, principles, and ideas is achieved through deductive reasoning.

Similarly, he believed in the idea of meaningful learning as opposed to rote memorization. In the preface to his book &quot;Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View&quot;, he says that &quot;If [he] had to reduce all of educational psychology to just one principle, [he] would say this: The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach him accordingly&quot; (Ausubel, 1968, p. vi) Through his belief of meaningful learning, Ausubel developed his theory of advance organizers. However, Ausubel was a critic of discovery-based teaching techniques, stating:
Actual examination of the research literature allegedly supportive of learning by discovery reveals that valid evidence of this nature is virtually nonexistent. It appears that the various enthusiasts of the discovery method have been supporting each other research-wise by taking in each other&#x27;s laundry, so to speak, that is, by citing each other&#x27;s opinions and assertions as evidence and by generalizing wildly from equivocal and even negative findings.
==Advance organizers==
An advance organizer is information presented by an instructor that helps the student organize new incoming information. This is achieved by directing attention to what is important in the coming material, highlighting relationships, and providing a reminder about relevant prior knowledge.

Advance organizers make it easier to learn new material of a complex or otherwise difficult nature, provided the following two conditions are met:
:1. The student must process and understand the information presented in the organizer—this increases the effectiveness of the organizer itself.
:2. The organizer must indicate the relations among the basic concepts and terms that will be used.

===Types===
Ausubel distinguishes between two kinds of advance organizer: &quot;comparative&quot; and &quot;expository&quot;.

1. Comparative Organizers
The main goal of comparative organizers is to activate existing schemas. Similarly, they act as reminders to bring into the working memory of what one may not realize is relevant. By acting as reminders, the organizer points out explicitly &quot;whether already established anchoring ideas are nonspecifically or specifically relevant to the learning material&quot; (Ausubel &amp; Robinson, 1969, p. 146). Similarly, a comparative organizer is used both to integrate as well as discriminate. It &quot;integrate[s] new ideas with basically similar concepts in cognitive structure, as well as increase[s] discriminability between new and existing ideas which are essentially different but confusably similar&quot; (Ausubel, 1968, p. 149).

An example of a comparative organizer would be one used for a history lesson on revolutions. This organizer &quot;might be a statement that contrasts military uprisings with the physical and social changes involved in the Industrial Revolution&quot; (Woolfolk et al., 2010, p. 289). Furthermore, one could also compare common aspects of other revolutions from different nations.

2. Expository Organizers
&quot;In contrast, expository organizers provide new knowledge that students will need to understand the upcoming information&quot; (Woolfolk et al., 2010, p. 289). Expository organizers are often used when the new learning material is unfamiliar to the learner. They often relate what the learner already knows with the new and unfamiliar material—this in turn is aimed to make the unfamiliar material more plausible to the learner.

An example which Ausubel and Floyd G. Robinson provide in their book &quot;School Learning: An Introduction To Educational Psychology&quot; is the concept of the Darwinian theory of evolution. To make the Darwinian theory of evolution more plausible, an expository organizer would have a combination of relatedness to general relevant knowledge that is already present, as well as relevance for the more detailed Darwinian theory.

Essentially, expository organizers furnish an anchor in terms that are already familiar to the learner.

Another example would be the concept of a right angle in a mathematics class. A teacher could ask students to point out examples of right angles that they can find in the classroom. By asking students to do this, it helps relates the students present knowledge of familiar classroom objects with the unfamiliar concept of a 90 degree right angle.

===Criticism===
&quot;The most persuasively voiced criticism of advance organizers is that their definition and construction are vague and, therefore, that different researchers have varying concepts of what an organizer is and can only rely on intuition in constructing one-- since nowhere, claim the critics, is it specified what their criteria are and how they can be constructed&quot; (Ausubel, 1978, p. 251).

In a response to critics, Ausubel defends advance organizers by stating that there is no one specific example in constructing advance organizers as they &quot;always depends on the nature of the learning material, the age of the learner, and his degree of prior familiarity with the learning passage&quot; (Ausubel, 1978, p. 251).

Another criticism of Ausubel&#x27;s advance organizers is that the critics often compare the idea of advance organizers with overviews. However, Ausubel has addressed that issue in saying that advance organizers differ from overviews &quot;in being relatable to presumed ideational content in the learner&#x27;s current cognitive structure&quot; (Ausubel, 1978, p. 252).

Thirdly, critics also address the notion of advance organizers on whether they are intended to favor high ability or low ability students. However, Ausubel notes that &quot;advance organizers are designed to favour meaningful learning..&quot; (Ausubel, 1978, p. 255). Therefore, to question whether advance organizers are better suited for high or low ability students is unrelated as Ausubel argues that advance organizers can be catered to any student to aid them in bridging a gap between what they already know and what they are about to learn.

<text>The Kruskal–Wallis test by ranks, Kruskal–Wallis formula_1 test (named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis), or one-way ANOVA on ranks is a non-parametric statistical test for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution. It is used for comparing two or more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes. It extends the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test, which is used for comparing only two groups. The parametric equivalent of the Kruskal–Wallis test is the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

A significant Kruskal–Wallis test indicates that at least one sample stochastically dominates one other sample. The test does not identify where this stochastic dominance occurs or for how many pairs of groups stochastic dominance obtains. For analyzing the specific sample pairs for stochastic dominance, Dunn&#x27;s test, pairwise Mann–Whitney tests with Bonferroni correction, or the more powerful but less well known Conover–Iman test are sometimes used.

It is supposed that the treatments significantly affect the response level and then there is an order among the treatments: one tends to give the lowest response, another gives the next lowest response is second, and so forth. Since it is a nonparametric method, the Kruskal–Wallis test does not assume a normal distribution of the residuals, unlike the analogous one-way analysis of variance. If the researcher can make the assumptions of an identically shaped and scaled distribution for all groups, except for any difference in medians, then the null hypothesis is that the medians of all groups are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one population median of one group is different from the population median of at least one other group. Otherwise, it is impossible to say, whether the rejection of the null hypothesis comes from the shift in locations or group dispersions. This is the same issue that happens also with the Mann-Whitney test. If the data contains potential outliers, if the population distributions have heavy tails, or if the population distributions are significantly skewed, the Kruskal-Wallis test is more powerful at detecting differences among treatments than ANOVA F-test. On the other hand, if the population distributions are normal or are light-tailed and symmetric, then ANOVA F-test will generally have greater power which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it indeed should be rejected.

==Method==

# Rank all data from all groups together; i.e., rank the data from to ignoring group membership. Assign any tied values the average of the ranks they would have received had they not been tied.
# The test statistic is given by
#:formula_2 where
#*formula_3 is the total number of observations across all groups
#*formula_4 is the number of groups
#*formula_5 is the number of observations in group formula_6
#*formula_7 is the rank (among all observations) of observation formula_8 from group formula_6
#*formula_10 is the average rank of all observations in group formula_6
#*formula_12 is the average of all the formula_13.
# If the data contain no ties, the denominator of the expression for formula_1 is exactly formula_15 and formula_16. Thus
#:formula_17The last formula contains only the squares of the average ranks.
# A correction for ties if using the short-cut formula described in the previous point can be made by dividing formula_1 by formula_19, where formula_20 is the number of groupings of different tied ranks, and formula_21 is the number of tied values within group formula_22 that are tied at a particular value. This correction usually makes little difference in the value of &quot;formula_23&quot; unless there are a large number of ties.
# When performing multiple sample comparisons, the type I error tends to become inflated. Therefore, the Bonferroni procedure is used to adjust the significance level, that is, formula_24, where formula_25 is the adjusted significance level, formula_26 is the initial significance level, and formula_27 is the number of contrasts.
# Finally, the decision to reject or accept the null hypothesis is made by comparing formula_1 to a critical value formula_29 (obtained from a table or software) for a given significance or alpha level. If formula_1 is bigger than formula_29, the null hypothesis is rejected. If possible (no ties, sample not too big) one should compare formula_1 to the critical value obtained from the exact distribution of formula_1. Otherwise, the distribution of H can be approximated by a chi-squared distribution with formula_34 degrees of freedom. If some formula_35 values are small (i.e., less than 5) the exact probability distribution of formula_1 can be quite different from this chi-squared distribution. If a table of the chi-squared probability distribution is available, the critical value of chi-squared, formula_37, can be found by entering the table at formula_34 degrees of freedom and looking under the desired significance or alpha level.
# If the statistic is not significant, there is no evidence of stochastic dominance among the samples. However, if the test is significant then at least one sample stochastically dominates another sample. Then, a researcher might use sample contrasts between individual sample pairs, or &quot;post hoc&quot; tests using Dunn&#x27;s test, which (1) properly employs the same rankings as the Kruskal–Wallis test, and (2) properly employs the pooled variance implied by the null hypothesis of the Kruskal–Wallis test in order to determine which of the sample pairs are significantly different. When performing multiple sample contrasts or tests, the Type I error rate tends to become inflated, raising concerns about multiple comparisons.

==Exact probability tables==
A large amount of computing resources is required to compute exact probabilities for the Kruskal–Wallis test. Existing software only provides exact probabilities for sample sizes of less than about 30 participants. These software programs rely on the asymptotic approximation for larger sample sizes. Exact probability values for larger sample sizes are available. Spurrier (2003) published exact probability tables for samples as large as 45 participants. Meyer and Seaman (2006) produced exact probability distributions for samples as large as 105 participants.

==Exact distribution of==
Choi et al.
made a review of two methods that had been developed to compute the exact distribution of formula_1, proposed a new one, and compared the exact distribution to its chi-squared approximation.

==Example==

===Test for differences in ozone levels by month===
The following example uses data from Chambers et al.
on daily readings of ozone for May 1 to September 30, 1973, in New York City. The data are in the R data set codice_1, and the analysis is included in the documentation for the R function codice_2. Boxplots of ozone values by month are shown in the figure.

The Kruskal-Wallis test finds a significant difference (p = 6.901e-06) indicating that ozone differs among the 5 months.
kruskal.test(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)

 Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

data: Ozone by Month
Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 29.267, df = 4, p-value = 6.901e-06
To determine which months differ, post-hoc tests may be performed using a Wilcoxon test for each pair of months, with a Bonferroni (or other) correction for multiple hypothesis testing.
pairwise.wilcox.test(airquality$Ozone, airquality$Month, p.adjust.method = &quot;bonferroni&quot;)

 Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test

data: airquality$Ozone and airquality$Month

 5 6 7 8 
6 1.0000 - - - 
7 0.0003 0.1414 - - 
8 0.0012 0.2591 1.0000 - 
9 1.0000 1.0000 0.0074 0.0325

P value adjustment method: bonferroni 
The post-hoc tests indicate that, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the following differences are significant (adjusted p &lt; 0.05).

*Month 5 vs Months 7 and 8
*Month 9 vs Months 7 and 8

== Implementation ==
The Kruskal-Wallis test can be implemented in many programming tools and languages. We list here only the open source free software packages:
* In Python&#x27;s SciPy package, the function codice_3 can return the test result and -value.
* R base-package has an implement of this test using codice_2.
* Java has the implement provided by provided by Apache Commons.
* In Julia, the package codice_5 has the function codice_6 to compute the p-value.

<doc id="1198760" wikidata="Q670315" url="?curid=1198760" title="OPM (band)">
<text>OPM is an American band based in Los Angeles. OPM has a distinctive sound, combining hip hop, rock music, and pop with laid-back reggae.

== History ==
Originally called &quot;Stash&quot;, the name OPM, according to the band&#x27;s frontman John E. Necro, is an abbreviation of the phrase &quot;Open People&#x27;s Minds&quot; (originally &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot;). This was stated during an interview with MarijuanaRadio.com. The name also sounds like the drug opium. The band&#x27;s original members were John E. Necro, Matthew Meschery and Geoff Turney, with Gary Dean and Etienne Franc later appointed permanent members in 2001. John E. and Geoff aka Casper first met on a bus ride with their girlfriends in 1996. At the time John E. was a label scout at Island Records and Geoff was in a band called &quot;Alpha Jerk&quot;. In 1997 John E. invited Geoff to do some recordings with him and his then brother-in-law Matthew Meschery. After 2 years they finally managed to start writing songs and sent a 3 track demo to Atlantic Records, leading them to get signed despite having never played live together. OPM released their debut album, &quot;Menace to Sobriety,&quot; in August 2000 on Atlantic Records. Their debut single &quot;Heaven Is a Halfpipe&quot; charted worldwide and won the Kerrang! Award for Best Single. They performed their hit single on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on July 20, 2001.

After the &quot;Menace to Sobriety&quot; tour, Matthew Meschery decided to leave the band. John E. Necro stated &quot;that was the biggest blow of anyone&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t think Matthew thought it through. It seemed like a really good idea when we got started, but it was more than he bargained for&quot; during an interview in 2009. In the October 2015 edition of Rock Sound magazine, Matthew revealed he would &quot;often get stage fright&quot; when performing live and &quot;The idea of touring another record for two years felt pretty daunting. I was done.&quot; Matthew along with Etienne Franc and Gary Dean then formed a band by the name of &quot;The Free Agency&quot; in 2003 after they all departed OPM. As of 2007, Matthew has been working for ITVS.

In 2002, they replaced Matthew with Big B and signed to Suburban Noize Records. They left Atlantic Records as they were not interested in releasing another OPM album. John E. spoke of this in 2004 by saying &quot;They&#x27;d spent so much to promote the first album, that we thought everything was a go with the second record. But they kept sending us back into the studio…we wrote over 50 songs while waiting for the label to make a move. We finally got to the point where we realized that we needed more attention than they were giving us, so we started working on getting out of our deal.&quot; Their second album, &quot;ForThemAsses&quot;, was released in June 2004. The album was produced by OPM and Steve Gallagher and features guest appearances by reggae artists Yellowman and Eek-A-Mouse along with Johnny Richter of the Kottonmouth Kings. The only single from the album was &quot;Horny&quot;, which was released a year later in 2005. Jonathan Williams was then appointed as a permanent member, having provided keyboards for the &quot;ForThemAsses&quot; album. Matt Rowe was appointed as bass player in 2005 along with Robert Bradley on drums. Their third album was &quot;California Poppy&quot;, released in July 2006. The album was supported by the release of the In the OPMDEN EP in 2006. In 2008 Robert left the band and was immediately replaced by Carlos Perez. OPM released their fourth album, &quot;Golden State of Mind&quot; in September 2008. The album was produced by Michael Patterson who also produced the band&#x27;s debut album. Carlos Perez then left the band to become the drummer for Big B in 2009 and was replaced by Shane Mayo.

The band joined the new label MNO records, founded by John E. and released their single &quot;Holiday Under The Sun&quot; in 2010. In 2012 the band released a new EP called &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; to celebrate 13 years since the band&#x27;s formation. When asked why a 13th anniversary, John E. Necro explained the band was originally planning a 10th anniversary, but due to a band hiatus which involved building a new studio, he claimed the 10th year &quot;slipped past us, without realizing&quot; and decided on 13 since it is considered an unlucky number. It featured 5 re-recordings of classic songs. In 2013 they released a new single entitled &quot;Everything&#x27;s The Same In LA&quot;. Matt Rowe and Shane Mayo left the band in 2014 to focus on their other band &quot;Garrett Lee Robinson&quot;, who are also signed to OPM&#x27;s label MNO records. In 2015 Carlos Perez returned to OPM to provide drums after originally leaving the band in 2009.

OPM released their 4th EP entitled &quot;The Minge Dynasty&quot; in August 2015 as well as announcing a European tour for 2015. The EP features a new single called &quot;Millionaire Like Me&quot;. Big B returns to feature on the EP, produced by Ras MG. They also re-released &quot;Menace to Sobriety&quot; in September 2015 for the 15th anniversary of the release of their debut album. The re-release featured one bonus track called &quot;Feel The Pain&quot;, which was one of the band&#x27;s first songs recorded in 1999 with the original lineup (John E., Matthew and Geoff).
