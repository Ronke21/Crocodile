<text>Eva Ionesco (born 18 July 1965) is a French actress and filmmaker. She is the daughter of photographer Irina Ionesco and came to international prominence as a child model after being featured in her mother&#x27;s works.

==Early life==
Ionesco was born to photographer Irina Ionesco, a Frenchwoman of Romanian descent, who had a relationship with a Hungarian man who worked in the military. Prior to Ionesco&#x27;s birth, her mother had worked as a contortionist as she had come from a family of circus performers on her maternal side. Her parents separated when she was 3 at which point Ionesco became estranged from her father.

In 1977 her mother lost custody of her and Ionesco lived for a time with the parents of footwear designer Christian Louboutin who had already left home.
From the age of 13 Ionesco became a regular club-goer at Le Palace along with Christian Louboutin and Edwige Belmore and also developed a drug habit. She was in and out of various foster homes until an older boyfriend of hers took custody of her at the age of 16.

==Career==
At the age of 5, Eva became her mother&#x27;s favorite photo model. Irina Ionesco&#x27;s erotic photographs of her young daughter Eva have been a source of controversy since they first appeared in the 1970s. Eva also modeled for other photographers such as Jacques Bourboulon.

She is the youngest model ever to appear in a &quot;Playboy&quot; nude pictorial, since she was featured at age 11 in the October 1976 issue of the Italian edition of the magazine in a set by Bourboulon. In that picture, she posed nude at a beach. Another of her nude pictorials, in the November 1978 issue of the Spanish edition of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, was a selection of her mother&#x27;s photographs. She also appeared on the cover page of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; at the age of 12 completely nude. The issue was later expunged from the magazine&#x27;s records.

In the 1980s, Ionesco attended the prestigious acting school &quot;Amandiers&quot;, directed by Patrice Chéreau and . She made her film début at the age of 11 in 1976, playing a child in Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;The Tenant&quot;. A short time later she was cast in films of the mid-1970s such as &quot;Maladolescenza&quot; (also known as &quot;Puppy Love&quot;).

Eva claimed her story served as inspiration for Louis Malle&#x27;s film &quot;Pretty Baby&quot;.

===Directorial career===
Ionesco began directing in 2006.

In 2011 she directed her first full-length feature film, &quot;My Little Princess&quot;, which debuted at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The film, loosely inspired by Ionesco&#x27;s personal life, starred Isabelle Huppert as a predatory photographer who uses her young daughter as a model in a series of nude photos.

Ionesco again paired with Isabelle Huppert for her next film, &quot;Golden Youth&quot;, about a young couple in Paris who begin to spend time with a much older and wealthier couple.

===Writing career===
In 2015 Ionesco&#x27;s husband Simon Liberati released a book about their courtship and her childhood called &quot;Eva&quot;.

In 2017 Ionesco released her first book, &quot;Innocence&quot;, which dealt with her fractured relationship with her father.

==Legal disputes==
Since the time in which her mother lost custody of her for repeatedly photographing or allowing Ionesco to be photographed by others completely nude, Ionesco has been engaged in protracted court battles with her mother to censor and reclaim the images taken of her as a child.

She tried three times to sue her mother for emotional distress, and the trial is still going on through various courts in France. In 1998 the French police confiscated from her mother&#x27;s apartment hundreds of photographs in which she appears at the age of five in suggestive poses and in complete nudity.

In 2012 Eva sued her mother for taking pornographic photos of her as a child. Although much of her claim was denied, she did receive some compensation.

== Personal life ==
Ionesco has a son, Lukas Ionesco, born in 1995.

Since 2013, she has been married to author Simon Liberati.

<text>A hodograph is a diagram that gives a vectorial visual representation of the movement of a body or a fluid. It is the locus of one end of a variable vector, with the other end fixed. The position of any plotted data on such a diagram is proportional to the velocity of the moving particle. It is also called a velocity diagram. It appears to have been used by James Bradley, but its practical development is mainly from Sir William Rowan Hamilton, who published an account of it in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy&quot; in 1846.

==Applications==

It is used in physics, astronomy, solid and fluid mechanics to plot deformation of material, motion of planets or any other data that involves the velocities of different parts of a body.

===Meteorology===

In meteorology, hodographs are used to plot winds from soundings of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It is a polar diagram where wind direction is indicated by the angle from the center axis and its strength by the distance from the center. In the figure to the right, at the bottom one finds values of wind at 4 heights above ground. They are plotted by the vectors formula_1 to formula_2. One has to notice that direction are plotted as mentioned in the upper right corner.

With the hodograph and thermodynamic diagrams like the tephigram, meteorologists can calculate:

* Wind shear: The lines uniting the extremities of successive vectors represent the variation in direction and value of the wind in a layer of the atmosphere. Wind shear is important information in the development of thunderstorms and future evolution of wind at these levels.
* Turbulence: wind shear indicates possible turbulence that would cause a hazard to aviation.
* Temperature advection: change of temperature in a layer of air can be calculated by the direction of the wind at that level and the direction of the wind shear with the next level. In the northern hemisphere, warm air is to the right of the wind shear vector between levels in the atmosphere. The opposite is true in the southern hemisphere (see thermal wind). Using the example hodograph, the wind formula_3 from the southwest meets the right side of the wind shear vector which means warm advection is occurring and thus the air is warming at that level.

==Distributed hodograph==

It is a method of presenting the velocity field of a point in planar motion. The velocity vector, drawn at scale, is shown perpendicular rather than tangent to the point path, usually oriented away from the center of curvature of the path. 

==Hodograph transformation==
Hodograph transformation is a technique used to transform nonlinear partial differential equations into linear version. It consists of interchanging the dependent and independent variables in the equation to achieve linearity.

* Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector, for an example in solving the Kepler problem

<text>Derryn Nigel Hinch (born 9 February 1944) is a New Zealand-born media personality, politician, actor, journalist and published author. He is best known for his career in Australia, on Melbourne radio and television. He served as a Senator for Victoria from 2016 to 2019.

Hinch was elected to the Senate representing Victoria as the head of Derryn Hinch&#x27;s Justice Party at the 2016 federal election. Aged 72 at the time, Hinch was, when elected, the oldest federal parliamentarian ever to be elected for the first time. He lost his senate seat in the 2019 election.

He remained host of his weekly program &quot;Hinch Live&quot; until the election campaign period officially commenced, in a decision supported by Sky News Live. He has been the host of 3AW&#x27;s &quot;Drive&quot; radio show, and a National Public Affairs commentator for the Seven Network on &quot;Sunday Night&quot;, &quot;Today Tonight&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;.

Hinch has been convicted of contempt of court three times, serving two prison sentences and one sentence of house detention.

==Career==

===Print===
Hinch began his career at the age of 15 with the &quot;Taranaki Herald&quot; in New Plymouth, New Zealand in 1960. In 1963, he came to Australia on the MS &quot;Wanganella&quot; and joined &quot;The Sun&quot; in Sydney. By 1966, he had become a foreign correspondent for the Fairfax organisation, and in New York became bureau chief in 1972. He lived in New York for 11 years. Hinch returned to Sydney and was editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1976–1977.

=== Television ===
Hinch hosted &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; on the Seven Network between 1982 and 1983. From 1987 to 1991, Hinch hosted his own current affairs show on the Seven Network titled &quot;Hinch&quot;, which later moved to Network Ten where it ran from 1992 to 1994. In 1994, Hinch joined the Nine Network and hosted &quot;The Midday Show&quot; for a year. He has also appeared on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;Underbelly&quot; and &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot; as a guest playing for charity.

In September 2012, Hinch rejoined the Seven Network as national public affairs commentator, though there were rumours that &quot;Hinch&quot; might make a comeback (although this never eventuated). From February 2015, Hinch hosted a twice weekly news opinion program, &quot;Hinch Live&quot;, over the weekend on Sky News Australia.

*&quot;Hinch Live&quot;, Sky News Australia (2015–2016)

===Radio===
In 1978, Hinch had a morning program on 3XY. In 1979, Hinch moved to 3AW, hosting a successful morning program for eight years. In 1987, he left radio to host &quot;Hinch At Seven&quot; on television.

During the 1990s, he had a brief stint presenting talkback on Adelaide station 5DN, before returning to 3AW in 2000 to host &quot;Nightline&quot;. In 2001, he began a two-year stint at 3AK before returning to 3AW to host the drive-time program in 2003. He was often absent from the programs due to suspension, poor health and house arrest. In August 2012, it was announced that Hinch&#x27;s contract would not be renewed by 3AW, and he would be replaced by financial commentator Tom Elliott. He is the Melbourne correspondent for New Zealand radio network Newstalk ZB and often presents political commentaries on the station.

In 2010 he was inducted into the Australian Commercial Radio Hall of Fame.

===Acting===
In September 2008, Hinch had a four-week run as The Criminologist (narrator) in the Australian tour of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show.&quot; He also appeared as himself, in a minor role, in the 2000 film &quot;The Wog Boy&quot; with Nick Giannopoulos, and reprised the role in its 2022 sequel, &quot;Wog Boys Forever&quot;. Hinch also made cameo appearances on &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, which was the same sketch show where he was parodied as &quot;Hunch&quot;, played by Steve Vizard. Hinch played the role of Senator in 2016 movie The Colour of Darkness.

===Politics===
In 2015, Hinch established Derryn Hinch&#x27;s Justice Party, and was subsequently elected to the Australian Senate as senator for Victoria at the 2016 double dissolution election on 2 July 2016. At the age of 73, he became the oldest new member ever elected to the Australian parliament. His party&#x27;s main emphasis is on criminal justice reform, including tougher sentences for violent and sexual offenders, no bail for those accused of a serious violent offence, parole reform, and a public register of sex offenders. Other positions include equal rights for all citizens regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, tougher laws against animal cruelty, and support for voluntary euthanasia. Following the announcement of the 2016 Senate election results, other Senators negotiated, against Hinch&#x27;s objections, to allocate him a three-year rather than a six-year Senate term.

In August 2017, it was revealed that Hinch holds an American Social Security number, raising concerns during the dual citizenship crisis that he may be disqualified from office under Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. However, in September 2017, the Attorney-General made the decision not to refer him to the High Court.

Hinch has shown support for capital punishment.

In the 2019 elections, Hinch&#x27;s bid for re-election to the Senate was unsuccessful. As a result, Hinch&#x27;s party is not represented in the Australian federal parliament but retains two seats in the Victorian Legislative Council. 

Hinch most recently contested the 2022 Victorian state election for the South-Eastern Metropolitan Region but was unsuccessful.

Hinch opposes the Indigenous Voice to Parliament.

In February 2024, Hinch announced that he will run in the 2024 Melbourne City Council election.

==Controversies==

===Michael Glennon===
In 1985, Hinch reported that Michael Glennon, who had previously been convicted of indecent assault against a minor, was operating a youth camp while facing new charges. Hinch, who says he was concerned that parents were unknowingly sending their children to Glennon&#x27;s camp, first appealed privately to then Victorian Premier John Cain and the then-Attorney-General, as well as the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia, but in Hinch&#x27;s words, they &quot;washed their hands&quot; of the situation. Subsequently, Hinch publicly identified Glennon during his trial on the third set of charges, in spite of the strong sub judice rule under Australian jurisprudence. This delayed the trial while Hinch was tried on contempt of court charges; Hinch was fined $10,000 and imprisoned for twelve days. This was the first time anyone had gone to prison on a prior restraint issue in Australia. Hinch appealed his case as far as the High Court of Australia, which affirmed his conviction. In its ruling, the Court held that despite Hinch&#x27;s motivation of warning the public that Glennon continued to hold a position in a youth organisation, it was sufficient to inform them of the current charges against him, and that the information about his prior conviction was prejudicial under Australian law. Hinch called the incident &quot;the thing I&#x27;m most proud of in my life.&quot;

===Mick Gatto&#x27;s call===
On 24 June 2008, while Hinch was discussing the celebrity status of underworld crime figures during his drive program, Mick Gatto phoned in and had a brief confrontation with Hinch, ending with a death threat.

===John Laws===
On 30 July 2007, John Laws and Hinch attended the &quot;40 Years of Radio Legends&quot;, after which Hinch complained the &quot;event had been turned into a tribute to Laws&quot;, among other comments which caused ill feeling between the two.

On 5 December 2007, Hinch was abused verbally with obscenities by John Laws while dining at lunch with 2CH personality Bob Rogers in a restaurant at the Finger Wharf in Woolloomooloo, Sydney.

===Sexual relationship with teenager===
In his 2004 book &quot;The Fall and Rise of Derryn Hinch&quot;, and in a radio editorial in March 2005, Hinch admitted to having sex with a 15-year-old female when he was in his early thirties, although he stated he &quot;thought she was about 25&quot;. Following his on-air admission, &quot;Herald Sun&quot; journalist Andrew Bolt called for his prosecution. In 2013, Hinch wrote that after 30 years, the woman had contacted him and said he was wrong about her age. She said she was born in 1961 and they met shortly after he joined 3AW in 1979. That made her 17 at the time of the liaison (which is above the age of consent in Australia). The ABC journalist James Purtill article on 6 July 2016 mentions only one (of the two) published self-admissions.

== Criminal convictions ==

===1987 conviction and imprisonment===
Hinch served 12 days in prison and was fined 15,000 in 1987 for contempt of court after he publicly revealed paedophile Roman Catholic priest Michael Charles Glennon&#x27;s prior conviction while a trial was still pending.

===2011 conviction and home detention===
In June 2011, he was convicted of breaching suppression orders against the names of two sex offenders, and was subsequently sentenced to five months&#x27; home detention.

===2014 conviction and imprisonment===
In October 2013, Hinch was found guilty of contempt of court for breaching a suppression order by revealing details of the criminal history of Jill Meagher&#x27;s killer, Adrian Ernest Bayley. The judge gave Hinch 90 days to pay the fine, or else face 50 days in prison. On 16 January 2014, one day prior to the expiration of the 90-day period, Hinch advised that he would not pay the fine &#x27;on principle&#x27;. He was imprisoned on 17 January 2014. On 7 March 2014, he was released from prison after 50 days, having served his full sentence. He was greeted by his partner Natasha Chadwick, other friends and a substantial media contingent.

==Personal life==
Hinch has been married five times. His first marriage was to Lana Wells, an editor. His second marriage was to Eve Carpenter, a flight attendant. He then married Australian actress Jacki Weaver. They were married in 1983 and remained so for 13 years before divorcing in 1996. It has been widely reported that they remarried in 1997 before divorcing again in 1998, however Weaver has denied that any such second marriage ever took place. He married Chanel Hayton in February 2006 and they separated in late 2012. His most recent publicised relationship was with Natasha Chadwick, a former detective sergeant with NSW Police and freelance journalist.

In March 2017, Hinch told the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; that he had been molested by a brother of one of his father&#x27;s friends as a nine-year-old boy in his childhood home in New Plymouth in 1953.

Hinch identifies as an atheist.

=== Health ===
In 2006, Hinch lost weight and his health declined. On 4 March 2007, he revealed on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; he had been suffering from advanced cirrhosis of the liver, and that a tumour had been found on his liver. On 27 April 2007, Hinch returned to hospital for additional scans. On 4 August 2007, Hinch revealed he had inoperable liver cancer.

On 20 September 2010, Hinch confirmed the liver cancer diagnosis, and said that he expected to undergo surgery to remove a third of his liver, and that this would take him off-air for several weeks. Doctors gave him a 60 per cent chance of surviving a further five years. On 4 November 2010, Hinch told his listeners that his doctors had told him that without a liver transplant, his maximum survival would be 12 months.

On 6 July 2011, Hinch underwent liver transplant surgery at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne.

<text>David Garst (September 10, 1926 in Coon Rapids, Iowa – January 9, 2006), was a seed industry leader, farmer, and former Executive President of Garst Seed Company. He also worked in the livestock, fertilizer, and chemical businesses, and contributed to foreign agricultural development projects in Eastern Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean. Garst believed that farming in the United States is fettered by governmental and environmental regulation.

Garst was appointed by the Carter administration to the Presidential Mission on Agricultural Development in Central America and the Caribbean. The work of this committee led to the Caribbean Basin Initiative passed under President Ronald Reagan. Garst helped to develop the National Corn Growers Association that promoted open trade with Communist countries and sends aid in the form of farming technology to developing nations. In the 1990s, under the Clinton administration, Garst lead the agricultural portion of a development project in the Staritsky district of Moscow. The project included the development of a dairy industry, egg and broiler houses, hog farms, packing plants, roads, and marketing systems. Garst was a leader in Howard Dean&#x27;s campaign in Iowa and was an active voice in the opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Garst married Georganne (Jo) Orenstein (October 9, 1928 – March 1, 1984) on July 12, 1949, and Marilyn Ann Shinn on March 23, 1985 (divorced 1996). He married Marilyn Reineke in May 2005. He was the son of agriculturalist Roswell Garst and Elizabeth Henak.

He is credited as bringing forth innovations that helped the corn market.

<doc id="1218889" wikidata="Q1454909" url="?curid=1218889" title="Peggy Sue">
<text>&quot;Peggy Sue&quot; is a rock and roll song written by Jerry Allison and Norman Petty (according to the official record, though Buddy Holly is known to be a principal songwriter too), and recorded and released as a single by Buddy Holly on September 20, 1957. The Crickets are not mentioned on label of the single (Coral 9-61885), but band members Joe B. Mauldin (string bass) and Jerry Allison (drums) played on the recording. This recording was also released on Holly&#x27;s eponymous 1958 album.

==Production==
The song was originally entitled &quot;Cindy Lou&quot;, after Holly&#x27;s niece, the daughter of his sister Pat Holley Kaiter. The title was later changed to &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; in reference to Peggy Sue Gerron (1940–2018), the girlfriend (and future wife) of Jerry Allison, the drummer for the Crickets, after the couple had temporarily broken up.

In her memoir, &quot;Whatever Happened to Peggy Sue?&quot;, Gerron stated that she first heard the song at a live performance at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium in 1957, and that she was &quot;so embarrassed, I could have died.&quot;

Appropriately, Allison had a prominent role in the production of the song, playing paradiddles on the drums throughout the song, the drums&#x27; sound rhythmically fading in and out as a result of real-time engineering techniques by the producer, Norman Petty. Joe B. Mauldin (string bass) also played on the recording.

Initially, only Allison and Petty were listed as the song&#x27;s authors. At Allison&#x27;s insistence, Holly was credited as a co-writer after his death.

==Reception==
&quot;Peggy Sue&quot; went to number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart in 1957.

It is ranked number 194 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2004 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot; In 1999, National Public Radio (NPR) included the song on the NPR 100, a list of the &quot;100 Most Important American Musical Works of the 20th Century.&quot; The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum included the song on its list of the &quot;Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.&quot;

==&quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;==
Holly wrote a sequel, &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, and recorded a demonstration version in his New York City apartment on December 5, 1958, accompanied only by himself on guitar. The tape was discovered after his death and was &quot;enhanced&quot; for commercial release, with the addition of backing vocals and an electric guitar track that drowns out Holly&#x27;s playing and almost drowns out his voice. The rarely heard original version was released on a vinyl collection, &quot;The Complete Buddy Holly&quot;. It was later played over the opening credits of the 1986 Kathleen Turner film &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;.

After Holly&#x27;s death, the Crickets released their own version as a single in 1960. They followed the original arrangements, with David Box, a Holly soundalike, as the lead vocalist.

==Cover versions==
This song has been covered many times, including by John Lennon, New Riders of the Purple Sage, The Beach Boys, The Hollies, and Waylon Jennings (who worked with Holly).

An adaptation of &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; entitled &quot;Christmas Time Is Here Again&quot; which made use of the backing track from The Beach Boys&#x27; cover version featured on their 1998 compilation album &quot;Ultimate Christmas&quot;.

<text>Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer (), also known as Tel HaShomer Hospital, is the largest hospital in Israel, located in the Tel Aviv District city of Ramat Gan in the Tel HaShomer neighborhood, Israel. In 2020, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked it as the 9th-best hospital in the world, in 2021, the 10th best, and in 2024 the 9th best; in all three cases scoring the highest for an Asian or Israeli hospital.

==History==

The hospital was established in 1948 as Israel&#x27;s first military hospital, to treat Israeli casualties of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. It was founded in a cluster of abandoned military barracks from the Mandate era, and was originally known as Army Hospital No. 5. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had it renamed Tel HaShomer Hospital.

In 1953, it became a civilian hospital, and Dr. Chaim Sheba became its director. Following Sheba&#x27;s death, the hospital was renamed in his honor. Mordechai Shani served as Director General for thirty-three years.

Situated on an campus in east Ramat Gan, Sheba operates 120 departments and clinics. It has 1,430 beds, about 1,250 physicians, 2,300 nurses and 1,500 other healthcare workers. Sheba also employs 1,700 other staff, and nearly 1,000 long-term volunteers, researchers and foreign interns.

It handles over 1,000,000 patient visits a year, including 200,000 emergency visits annually, and conducts more than two million medical tests of all types each year, on a $320 million (approximate) annual budget. Sheba is supported by donations from a network of philanthropists and friends from around the world.

Sheba includes an acute care hospital, a rehabilitation hospital (one of the largest rehabilitation hospitals in the world, with 800 beds and 14 buildings), a women&#x27;s hospital, a children&#x27;s hospital, an eating disorder clinic, a PTSD clinic for soldiers, a laboratory division, an outpatient division, and an academic campus.

Sheba is home to the Israel National Center for Health Policy and Epidemiology Research (equivalent to the U.S. National Institutes of Health), the internationally acclaimed Israel National Center for Medical Simulation (MSR), the Israel National Blood Bank and Cord Blood Bank, and the Safra International Congenital Heart Center. Other major centers at Sheba include the Sheba Cancer Treatment and Research Centers, the Sheba Heart Center that was donated by Lev Leviev, and the Tel Hashomer Medical Research, Infrastructure and Services Co. Ltd., which provides global consulting and training services There is also a rehabilitation hotel, the Shilev Hotel, for recuperating patients. It has 36 double rooms and a medical wing with a doctors office, nurses room, and treatment room.

Sheba provides services to patients from across the Middle East, including many patients (especially children) from the Palestinian Authority. It also provides guidance and mentoring in the planning, construction and operation of healthcare systems and hospitals around the world. Sheba has helped to found a multi-disciplinary clinic in Ukraine, an imaging Center in Uzbekistan, a medical center in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, an oncology center in Mauritania, a polyclinic in the Ivory Coast, and more. Sheba has sent medical support to Kosovo, Armenia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Rwanda. Many patients from the Palestinian Authority and the Arab world are treated at Sheba. After a massive explosion in Equatorial Guinea, a relief mission was sent by Sheba Medical Center. Eight Kurdish infants in need of emergency cardiac surgery were operated on in Israel by Sheba&#x27;s pediatric cardiac-thoracic surgeons. In December 2020, Sheba&#x27;s Israel Center for Disaster Medicine and Humanitarian Response team dispatched a coronavirus medical team to the Piedmont region of Northern Italy. Sheba sent a large shipment of equipment to Uruguay along with experts in logistics, treatment and pandemic mitigation.

In 2021, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sheba Medical Center. According to a statement released by the Emirates News Agency, the MoU aims to &quot;create a framework for cooperation in developing and improving healthcare services to meet the needs of a healthier community.&quot;

==Clinical research==

A large proportion of clinical research in Israel is conducted at Sheba. It is the main clinical trial venue for human health scientific studies conducted by the Weizmann Institute of Science, Tel Aviv University, and Bar-Ilan University. In 2011, Sheba topped the list of Israeli hospitals for revenue acquired through research, at NIS 42.4 million, but came in second in 2012.

Scientific research at Sheba includes a study of pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue in a patient with ovarian failure after chemotherapy; a study of alginate-based stem cell biomaterial injected into heart attack victims that may repair heart tissue; and a study showing that heavy cell phone users are subject to a higher risks of benign and malignant tumors of the salivary gland. The Israeli company Ventor Technologies developed a novel type of heart valve which can be implanted by catheterization rather than open-heart surgery at Sheba. This invention was sold to medical device maker Medtronic in 2009 for US$325 million, of which about 10% went to Sheba Medical Center.

In October 2020, the hospital piloted a rapid coronavirus test that detects protein portions of the virus and yields results within two to 15 minutes.

== Edmond and Lily Safra Children’s Hospital ==
Established in 2002 with the support of the Edmond J. Safra Foundation, the pediatric section of the Medical Center features diagnosis as well as treatment in numerous specialized clinics for children: Premature, intensive care, haemato-oncology and stem cell transplantation, surgery, Louis-Bar syndrome, radiology and imaging, oncology, gastroenterology, immunology, rheumatology, and surgery of congenital malformations.

The hospital provides treatments for children from Israel as well as from the neighbouring Palestinian Authority and from other regions in the Middle East.

The Children&#x27;s Hospital receives more than 60,000 patients each year. It has notably treated some of the hostages released after the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, 2023 and was praised for its readiness to provide immediate physical and psychological care.

It also provides clinical research in various fields.

== Foreign internships ==
In 2011, the hospital signed agreements with St. George&#x27;s University in London and with the University of Nicosia (Cyprus) to train medical students for a fee of 25,000 euros per student and to award them MBBS degrees. Deans of several Israeli medical schools, including Yosef Mekori of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, and Rivka Carmi, president of the Ben-Gurion University, criticised the programme, claiming it would hurt the quality of medical education received by Israeli students and harm medical care in Israel.

==Medical tourism==
Through its Global Patient Services, Sheba provides world-class medicine with a personal touch to thousands of patients annually from 100+ countries in Europe, South America, North America, and Africa. The dedicated team is experienced in serving individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, offering services in English, Russian, and Arabic, and providing translation assistance as needed. 

International patients receive the same high-quality care and access to advanced therapies as domestic patients, benefiting from Sheba’s various clinics and acute care facilities. The Global Patient Services team assists in arranging personalized travel and healthcare packages, encompassing clinical consultations, imaging and laboratory diagnostics, surgery, treatment plans, and rehabilitation. Each patient is assigned a personal coordinator and interpreter to guide them throughout their treatment journey at Sheba. 

Notably, many international patients seek Sheba&#x27;s expertise for oncological treatments, including advanced therapies such as CAR-T therapy and TIL immunotherapy. Sheba&#x27;s commitment to compassionate care extends beyond Israel&#x27;s borders, welcoming patients from across the Middle East, including countries without diplomatic relations with Israel, and engaging in humanitarian efforts worldwide. As a state-owned and regulated medical center, Sheba ensures transparency in all fees and upholds the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct among its staff.

==Awards and recognition==

Sheba Medical Center has been recognized by Newsweek as one of the world&#x27;s best hospitals for six consecutive years. In 2024, Sheba was ranked 9th globally, maintaining its position among the top ten hospitals worldwide. 

==Notable staff==

* Jacob Sadé
* Eli Schwartz
* Limor Schreibman-Sharir
* Shomron Ben-Horin

==Controversy==
On 12 June 2008 at 11 a.m., Sheba Medical Centre discharged patient Omar Abu Jariban, despite the patient still needing medical attention and being in a confused state, and handed him over to the police. Two days later, he was found dead by the side of Route 443, barefoot, still wearing a hospital gown, a catheter and a diaper. Abu Jariban, a Palestinian from Gaza, had allegedly stolen a car and was seriously injured in an accident on 28 May 2008. He was treated at Sheba Medical Centre, but discharged in very poor condition to the police. They first took him to Rehovot police station, but then dumped him by the side of a highway, barefoot and without food or water. He died from dehydration. After his body was identified, the police and hospital staff blamed each other for his death. In 2012, two Israeli police officers involved were convicted of negligent homicide and were sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Damages were paid to the family of the victim in the name of the police and the hospital.

In 2014, during 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, a Palestinian nurse of the clinic posted on Facebook that “the Israel Defense Forces are war criminals, only killing innocent people, and the state is claiming [it is done] &#x27;by mistake and we are investigating the incident.&#x27;” Hospital director Zeev Rotstein suspended the nurse for two weeks, writing that the nurse&#x27;s statement constituted a “disciplinary offense”. In accordance with a labour court rule, the hospital revoked the suspension, while the nurse dropped the request for an injunction against the suspension and apologized in writing to the hospital management for the post on his Facebook page.

In 2020, Mustafa Younis, an Israeli Arab, came to the clinic for a psychiatric examination. Inside the hospital, he threatened two people with a knife, but hurt nobody. Hospital security guards followed him and forcibly removed him from his car as he was about to leave. Younis stabbed one guard in the head, injuring him lightly. The guards disarmed and incapacitated him on the ground, then proceeded to shoot him five or six times and killed him. Only after several protests, the police opened an investigation into the killing.

<text>Per-Kristian Foss(born 19 July 1950) is a Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party and from 2014 to 2021 the Auditor General of Norway.

He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Oslo in 1981, and was re-elected on six occasions. He had previously served as a deputy representative during the term 1977–1981.

From 2001 to 2005, when the second cabinet Bondevik held office, Foss was Minister of Finance. He also acted as Prime Minister very briefly in 2002. During this period his seat in parliament was taken by Ine Eriksen Søreide. Foss has received much attention for being the first openly gay minister in a Norwegian government and lives in registered partnership with Jan Erik Knarbakk. He was the first openly homosexual national leader.

On the local level Foss was a deputy member of Oslo city council from 1971 to 1975.

From 1973 to 1977 he was the leader of the Young Conservatives (&quot;Unge Høyre&quot;), the youth wing of the Conservative Party. Per Kristian Foss was mentioned as a possible new leader for the Conservative Party after Jan Petersen resigned in 2004, but he declined to run and instead supported Erna Solberg. After Høyre struggled in elections and polls during the first years of Erna Solberg&#x27;s leadership he was also mentioned as a possible new leader, but he never challenged Solberg for the leadership position. At present Foss is deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and member of the party&#x27;s central board.

Foss has a cand.mag. degree in political science, public law and criminology from the University of Oslo (1977) and partial graduate studies in political science.

<text>Marvel UK was an imprint of Marvel Comics formed in 1972 to reprint US-produced stories for the British weekly comic market. Marvel UK later produced original material by British creators such as Alan Moore, John Wagner, Dave Gibbons, Steve Dillon, and Grant Morrison.

There were a number of editors in charge of overseeing the UK editions. Although based in the United States, Tony Isabella oversaw the establishment of Marvel UK. He was succeeded by UK-based editors Peter L. Skingley (a.k.a. Peter Allan) and then Matt Softly – both of whom were women who adopted male pen names for the job (in reality, they were Petra Skingley and Maureen Softly). They were then replaced by Neil Tennant, who later found fame with the pop group the Pet Shop Boys. Nick Laing succeeded him, but with a turbulent market and falling sales, Laing was let go and Dez Skinn took over. Paul Neary was editor in chief in 1995, when Marvel UK was shut down.

Panini Comics obtained the license to print Marvel material in 1995 and took over the UK office&#x27;s remaining titles.

==Publishing history==

=== Predecessors ===
After World War II, the UK was intent on promoting homegrown publishers, and thus banned the direct importation of American periodicals, including comic books; that ban was lifted in 1959. The British company Thorpe &amp; Porter became the sole UK distributor of both DC and Marvel comics. Thus it was that in the early 1960s brand-new American-printed copies of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1, &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15, and countless others appeared in the UK. Alan Class Comics also reprinted select Marvel superhero stories during this period. Thorpe &amp; Porter, however, went bankrupt in 1966 and was purchased by Independent News Distributors (IND), the distribution arm of National Periodical Publications (DC Comics). As a result, T &amp; P&#x27;s output became almost exclusively reprints of DC titles.

At that point, in early 1966, Odhams Press (a division of IPC Magazines) acquired the Marvel license, and reprints of American Marvel superhero material — including the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Thor, and the X-Men — began to be published in the UK in Odhams&#x27; Power Comics line of titles. Titles such as &quot;Wham!&quot;, &quot;Smash!&quot;, and &quot;Pow!&quot; featured a mix of Marvel reprints and original UK comics; while the titles &quot;Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Terrific&quot; were dominated by Marvel superhero stories. This arrangement lasted till March 1969, when the last Marvel strip was removed from &quot;Smash!&quot;.

Beginning about a year and a half later, from late November 1970 to late September 1971, reprints of Spider-Man and the Silver Surfer appeared in &quot;TV21&quot;, published by City Magazines (a company closely associated with IPC). From that point, no Marvel titles were being regularly reprinted in the UK (although IPC released a &quot;Marvel Annual&quot;, featuring Marvel superhero reprints, in autumn 1972).

=== Origins: &quot;MWOM&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man Comics Weekly&quot; ===
In 1972, seeing a gap in the popular weekly comics market of the UK, Marvel Comics formed their own British publishing arm, Marvel UK (under the corporate name of Magazine Management London Ltd.). Though publishing comics in the UK for a British audience, Marvel UK was under the editorial direction of Marvel&#x27;s New York offices, overseen by the then 21-year-old American writer/editor Tony Isabella. Pippa Melling (née King), a British former staffer at Odhams who was familiar with the adjustments needed to transform stories from the monthly American comics to the weekly British ones, was employed on a six-month contract to help set the whole thing up.

Marvel UK started with &quot;The Mighty World of Marvel&quot;, which featured mainly black-and-white art with spot colouring (except for the front and back pages which were in full colour). Originally the weekly comic was created by slicing up storylines from the monthly American versions of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, and the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

A few months later &quot;Spider-Man Comics Weekly&quot; was released. Again this carried on reprinted American &quot;Spider-Man&quot; material originally started in &quot;MWOM&quot;, with the adventures of Thor starting as a back-up feature. The new title allowed an entire issue of the US &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; to be reprinted every week in the UK publication. Both of these initial series were huge successes and became the mainstays of the Marvel UK lineup; &quot;The Mighty World Of Marvel&quot;, in one form or another, was published continuously until 1984, while the Spider-Man weekly comic (under many different name changes) would continue until 1985.

=== Expansion: Skingley and Softly era ===
In 1973, the US-based editor Isabella was replaced by the UK-based Petra Skingley (credited in the comics as &quot;Peter L. Skingley&quot; and &quot;Peter Allan.&quot;) That year, Marvel UK launched &quot;The Avengers&quot; — starting with material from issue #4 of the US series which reintroduced Captain America (issues #1-3 had been reprinted in &quot;The Mighty World of Marvel&quot;). The new title introduced glossy covers around a smaller 36-page comic, down from the previous 40-page format of &quot;MWOM&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man Comics Weekly&quot;. Doctor Strange was the back-up feature. Glossy covers were to be a distinctive feature of Marvel UK weeklies until the &quot;Marvel Revolution&quot; in 1979. The other two titles also changed to this new format. In &quot;Spider-Man&quot; the decrease to 36 pages marked the reduction of Spider-Man material so that now only half a US issue was reproduced in the UK weekly, and Iron Man was added to the lineup. (&quot;MWOM&quot; and &quot;SMCW&quot; had started at 40 pages but dropped to 32 before the launch of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.)
In 1974 two new weeklies were added that departed from the usual superhero fare. These were &quot;Dracula Lives!&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, the latter reprinting material from the American black &amp; white Marvel Monster Group brand. In 1976 &quot;Dracula Lives!&quot; was canceled and merged with &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; as of issue #88. The Apes adventures lasted until 1977, the final months as a co-feature with the Hulk, in &quot;MWOM&quot; from issue #231. The non-superhero launches continued in early 1975 as &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; was added as a weekly title.

In March 1975, Marvel UK launched a new weekly title called &quot;The Super-Heroes&quot; (simultaneously with &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot;). Although it originally starred popular characters like the Silver Surfer and the X-Men, &quot;The Super-Heroes&quot; eventually began reprinting stories starring such obscure characters as Doc Savage, Ant-Man, The Cat, Scarecrow, and Bloodstone. Maureen Softly (using her son&#x27;s name Matt in the credits). replaced Skingley as editor in late 1975.

Marvel UK&#x27;s fifth superhero title, also debuting in 1975 (October), was &quot;The Titans&quot;, which was notable for its use of a &quot;landscape&quot; orientation. Although this format allowed two pages of Marvel U.S. artwork to fit onto one (magazine-sized) Marvel UK page, reader reaction was mixed, as it made the text small and often difficult to read. &quot;The Titans&quot; featured well-known characters like Captain America, Captain Marvel, the Sub-Mariner, the Inhumans, and Nick Fury.

&quot;The Super-Heroes&quot; lasted fifty issues before being canceled in early 1976, at which point it was merged into &quot;Spider-Man Comics Weekly&quot; (which changed its title to &quot;Super Spider-Man with the Super-Heroes&quot;). At this point, the book also changed orientation to become a landscape-format comic like &quot;The Titans&quot;. The aforementioned &quot;Titans&quot; title ran 58 issues until late 1976, when it too was canceled. Towards the end of its run, the Avengers were moved over from &quot;The Mighty World of Marvel&quot; to be &quot;The Titans&quot;″ lead strip. As with &quot;The Super-Heroes&quot;, with &quot;The Titans&quot;″ cancellation it was merged with the weekly Spider-Man comic (which changed its title again, to &quot;Super Spider-Man and the Titans&quot;).

=== Tennant and Laing era ===
Marvel UK began to establish itself as a major publisher of weekly comic titles (along with D.C Thomson and IPC) under the direction of editor-in-chief Neil Tennant (later one of the Pet Shop Boys). Tennant was responsible for anglicising the dialogue of the comics to suit British readers, and for indicating where women needed to be redrawn &quot;more decently&quot; for the British editions.

However, with the exception of some new covers drawn by Marvel Comics&#x27; American staff, no original material had yet been produced by Marvel UK. This changed in 1976 when &quot;Captain Britain Weekly&quot; was launched, featuring a hero created for the British market. &quot;Captain Britain Weekly&quot; featured new stories in colour as well as reprints of &quot;Nick Fury&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; strips as backup. It was initially a success but eventually combined with Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; reprint title from #39.

It was Neil Tennant&#x27;s suggestion to create an original British Marvel war comic to compete with titles such as &quot;Warlord&quot; and &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;. While no original material was commissioned the concept of a war comic found fruition as &quot;Fury&quot; which ran from March to August 1977 before merging with &quot;MWOM&quot;. It reprinted &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot; and &quot;Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders&quot;.

Tenant left in 1977 and was replaced by Nick Laing. In early 1978, Laing oversaw the launch of Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Weekly&quot; title, soon after the film was released in the UK. The weekly issues split the stories from the US monthly issues into smaller installments, and it usually took three weekly issues to complete a US monthly issue. In May 1980 the title became known as &quot;The Empire Strikes Back Weekly&quot;, and in November 1980 it transformed into a monthly publication. Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic also published original &quot;Star Wars&quot; stories by British creators as well as reprinting the US comics material. Many, but not all, of these original British stories were reprinted in the 1990s by Dark Horse Comics. The format changed back to a weekly in June 1983 with the adaptation of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (which also became the new name of the publication), and remained so until its last issue in 1986. Prior to the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; comic, the strips in the UK &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics were printed in black and white, even those taken from the American color versions. The UK comics also reprinted several other supporting strips in each issue from other Marvel properties (such as &quot;The Micronauts&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Watcher&quot;, &quot;Star-Lord&quot;, etc.). While the comic was in a weekly format, the supporting strips often made up the bulk of each issue.

=== Skinn era (&quot;The Marvel Revolution&quot;)===
By the late 1970s, sales of Marvel UK titles had begun to fall and it was on a visit to the UK that Stan Lee headhunted Dez Skinn to revamp the ailing company. Knowing Skinn had significant experience in British comic publishing, Lee gave him the freedom to do what he felt best. Skinn had his own catchphrase in &quot;Dez Sez,&quot; which was inspired by Lee&#x27;s catchphrases from the 1960s. Skinn set out to change Marvel UK as he saw fit, dubbing the changes &quot;The Marvel Revolution&quot;. Taking over in late 1978, the first major change he brought was to have original material produced by British creators. Many of these creators had already worked with Skinn on his title &quot;The House of Hammer&quot; a few years earlier, plus some new young talent.

Skinn wrote: &quot;[T]raditional British comics were at the time selling 150,000+ a week, firm sale, no returns. If Marvel and Spider-Man could look British enough for some of that to rub off, everybody would be happy ... But fixing the covers to resemble the non-glossy generic look of weekly anthology titles was one thing ... Having &quot;splash&quot; pages and then five or six frames a page just didn&#x27;t stack up against &quot;Warlord&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Battle&quot;, and the rest with their nine to 12 a page.&quot; So the US artwork was re-sized to fit several pages onto one and emulate the look of the more established UK boys&#x27; weeklies.

Skinn reasoned that Marvel superhero weeklies had been effectively competing with each other in an already crowded market. So while the &quot;Spider-Man Comic&quot; was to be the flagship superhero comic (with Thor, Iron Man, Avengers, Fantastic Four, and Nova), &quot;The Mighty World of Marvel&quot; was re-launched as &quot;Marvel Comic&quot;, in the tradition of UK boys&#x27; adventure titles. Dracula, Conan the Barbarian, and Skull the Slayer joined (or re-joined) established strips Daredevil and Hulk (although the Hulk was replaced three issues after the re-launch by Godzilla, as the Hulk left for his own title).

The Hulk was a popular character – &quot;Rampage Weekly&quot; which starred The Defenders had been added to Marvel&#x27;s list of publications under Tennant&#x27;s editorship as a second vehicle for the green giant – and now with his own TV series Skinn saw the Hulk as the lead feature of another adventure style comic. &quot;Hulk Comic&quot; started out with originally produced Hulk stories by Steve Dillon, Paul Neary, and John Stokes, among others, which reflected the green-skinned behemoth as depicted on the TV. Skinn explained: &quot;As with &quot;Marvel Comic&quot;, I was wanting an adventure anthology title more than a superhero one. Super-heroes had never been big sellers in the UK, we had plenty of legends of the past to spin fantasies about. So I went that route, picking existing Marvel characters who weren&#x27;t really cut from the super-hero cloth.&quot; Originally produced stories were included, such as Nick Fury drawn by Steve Dillon, and Night Raven by Steve Parkhouse and David Lloyd. Also included was the Black Knight, a Marvel character revamped to take in Arthurian concepts, as well as feature the return of Captain Britain from comic book limbo. As well there was the usual US reprint material, such as Ant-Man and in later issues the Beast from &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, and even The Defenders were moved in from &quot;Rampage Monthly&quot; to increase the dose of Hulk action (a house ad showed a stern doctor holding out a handful of pills and saying, &quot;Boredom is a sickness... and there&#x27;s only one cure. More Hulk action!!!&quot;).

Arguably Skinn&#x27;s most important decision was to launch &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; in 1979. Based on the BBC TV series (which at that point had already been running for 16 years), &quot;Doctor Who Weekly&quot; featured original comics stories by John Wagner, Pat Mills, and Dave Gibbons, among many others, plus articles and features on the show itself. It proved a huge success, and by now Skinn had transformed Marvel UK back to being a major publisher of not just weekly comics but monthly titles such as &quot;Starburst&quot;. &quot;Starburst&quot; had been created by Skinn before he joined Marvel UK, but was purchased by Marvel when he joined the company.

Skinn left Marvel UK in 1980 (eventually forming Quality Communications in 1982).

==== Pocket Books ====
In March 1980, as part of the &quot;Marvel Revolution,&quot; Skinn launched the Marvel Pocket Books line with four 52-page titles. The line began with &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Star Heroes&quot; (featuring TV tie-in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and the toy-based strip the Micronauts continued from their previous run in &quot;Star Wars Weekly&quot;), and &quot;Chiller&quot; (starring Dracula and the Man-Thing with occasional appearance from other horror-related characters). Following Skinn&#x27;s belief that much of Marvel&#x27;s strongest material was that published in the 1960s and early 70s, many of these titles showcased strips from that period.

Skinn drew on the design of the traditional UK Picture Library titles (such as &quot;Thriller Picture Library&quot; and &quot;War Picture Library&quot;), which boomed in the 1960s, to establish a definitive look for the Pocket Books. Skinn wrote that they &quot;emulated the look in their &quot;Combat Picture Library&quot; covers ... that was the look I wanted, to pull the line of pocket books together visually and make them different to any of our other titles ...&quot;

The first four titles were later joined by &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Titans&quot; (reprinting the 1960s stories of Captain America, Thor and Iron Man), &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot; (featuring comic book adaptations of classic literature), &quot;Conan&quot;, and &quot;Young Romance&quot;. Some titles were not a success in terms of sales: &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Conan&quot;, &quot;The Titans&quot;, &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot;, and &quot;Young Romance&quot; were cancelled after 13 issues, while &quot;Star Heroes&quot; (which had replaced The Micronauts with the original X-Men from issue #10) was re-launched as &quot;X-Men Pocket Book&quot; from #14. All other Pocket Books were cancelled after issue 28 in July/August 1982.

The Hulk strips continued in a newly launched &quot;The Incredible Hulk Weekly&quot; and similarly the classic Fantastic Four strips resurfaced in a weekly title in October 1982. Both of these eventually folded into &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, where the strips continued on and off until it changed into &quot;The Spider-Man Comic&quot;, aimed at younger readers. The classic Spider-Man material continued in the first few issues of &quot;The Daredevils&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
In September 1981 Captain Britain got his own strip in the pages of &quot;Marvel Superheroes&quot; (the by-then firmly established monthly version of &quot;The Mighty World Of Marvel&quot;/&quot;Marvel Comic&quot;), as written by Dave Thorpe and drawn by Alan Davis. (Thorpe left in 1982, to be replaced by Alan Moore in one of Moore&#x27;s first major ongoing strips.) In October 1981, inspired by the success of its &quot;Doctor Who&quot; title, Marvel UK began publishing a monthly &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; title, initially edited by Stewart Wales. However, as the television series itself went off the air in late 1981, the magazine itself lasted less than two years.

Despite a flurry of new weeklies post-Skinn (&quot;Forces in Combat&quot;, &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, &quot;Future Tense&quot; and &quot;Valour&quot;), by 1983 Marvel UK moved mainly to monthly titles such as &quot;The Daredevils&quot; (featuring Moore and Davis&#x27;s &quot;Captain Britain&quot;). Many of Marvel UK&#x27;s titles wouldn&#x27;t last long, however, before being combined or cancelled outright due to poor sales. 

In January 1985 the first issue of &quot;Captain Britain Monthly&quot; appeared with its titular strip written by Jamie Delano and drawn by Alan Davis. This title lasted 14 issues before cancellation and would prove to be Marvel UK&#x27;s last major new title for several years. New material was still being produced, such as the &quot;Zoids&quot; stories (written by Grant Morrison) for &quot;Secret Wars&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man and Zoids&quot;, but not on the scale or diversity previously seen.

For the remainder of the 1980s the company published only a small handful of titles that appealed to superhero fans, but had considerable success on the UK newsstands with licensed titles such as Care Bears, Lady Lovely Locks, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, and many others. These all featured original strips as well as some US reprints.

&quot;Transformers&quot;, in particular, was a major seller for Marvel UK, selling 200,000 copies a week at its height. Its main writer, Simon Furman, would eventually take over the Marvel US version of the title as well, and continues to work on the franchise to this day, though it is no longer published by either branch of Marvel Comics. The Marvel UK &quot;Transformers&quot; series, running 332 issues, is, besides Bob Budiansky&#x27;s run on the American comic, regarded as the most important collection of Transformers fiction. As such, &quot;Transformers&quot; remains one of Marvel UK&#x27;s most important historical titles. (The Marvel UK &quot;Transformers&quot; series was reprinted by Titan Books in the 2000s with some omissions, notably all of the UK exclusive stories prior to issue 45. Although these have now been reprinted by IDW Publishing along with the rest of the weekly and Annual stories as part of &quot;The Transformers Classics UK&quot; collections.)

From 1988, it was &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; that became the top seller; it ran for 193 issues, four annuals, and a &quot;Slimer&quot; spinoff, and its characters were used to anchor several other titles like &quot;Wicked!&quot; and &quot;The Marvel Bumper Comic&quot;.

In 1988, Marvel UK letterer/designer Richard Starkings pushed for the company to publish its own US-format comics, beginning with &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Claws&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; (a spin-off character from Marvel UK&#x27;s &quot;Transformers&quot; title). &quot;The Sleeze Brothers&quot; (1989–1990) was a creator-owned title by John Carnell and Andy Lanning. It was Steve White who launched the first critically acclaimed volume of &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot; (1990–1991), written by Dan Abnett and John Tomlinson with art by Gary Erskine, which mixed superheroes and Arthurian myth. It also featured Captain Britain among many other Marvel Comics heroes, such as Iron Man.

Strip was a short-lived comics anthology published by Marvel UK in 1990. It ran for 20 issues (February - November 1990) and featured work by many British comics creators, including Alan Grant, Ian Gibson, Pat Mills, Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Si Spencer and John Wagner.
Strips include Marshal Law by Pat Mills and Kev O&#x27;Neill and Grimtoad by Grant, Wagner and Gibson.

By 1990, Marvel had told its UK branch that long miniseries were too expensive and that it should produce four-issue minis (John Freeman recalled &quot;some legal or distribution restriction in the US on publishing three-part miniseries, which the company would have preferred&quot;) that would try out new characters. Freeman and Dan Abnett first wanted to revive Death&#x27;s Head, give a miniseries to &quot;Strip&quot; character Rourke of the Radlands, and spin-off &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Abslom Daak as an original character. This last one was dropped as Marvel felt &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was &quot;a &#x27;dead&#x27; franchise and there was no value to Marvel in seeking to extend a brand they did not themselves own.&quot;

=== Neary era ===
Paul Neary became Marvel UK editor-in-chief circa 1990, appointed to revamp the company and make another attempt at the US market. As a stop-gap, he had two short-lived reprint titles created: &quot;Havoc&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot; (which reprinted &quot;Akira&quot;).

The US-format titles began with &quot;Death&#x27;s Head II&quot;, a recreation of Simon Furman&#x27;s cyborg bounty hunter. The titles were set in the existing Marvel Universe but with more of a focus on cyberpunky science fiction and magic than the traditional superhero fare. Titles such as &quot;Warheads&quot; (wormhole-hopping mercenaries), &quot;Motormouth&quot; (later &quot;Motormouth and Killpower&quot;, a streetwise girl and escaped genetically modified super-assassin hop around the universe having adventures) and a second volume of &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot;. These were all linked by plots featuring the organization &quot;Mys-Tech&quot;, a shadowy group of Faustians bent on world domination. Some of these titles were also reprinted in the UK anthology &quot;Overkill&quot;.

At some point during Neary&#x27;s run but before the market crash, Marvel UK was running low on money. They requested an emergency meeting with Marvel Entertainment executives Bill Bevin and Terry Stewart to approve a £1m last-ditch strategy. While they got the money, writer Sean Howe would later be told that Bevin was livid about being called to London for a mere one million, asking &quot;why are you wasting my time?&quot;

Neary instituted a deliberate policy to feature Marvel US guest-stars in the Marvel UK stories. However, they would only be featured on eleven pages, and these pages were designed to be able to cut from the main story; the eleven pages without the guest-star were run in &quot;Overkill&quot;. This policy was dropped after market research showed people expected to see superheroes in Marvel (&quot;that included watching a group of teenagers rip &quot;Overkill&quot; apart from behind a two-way mirror&quot;, according to Freeman). Where US Marvel characters were featured, all the storylines were approved by the American editor in charge of that book. Some were more responsive than others to the outlines, with editors such as Bobbie Chase offering useful feedback for Marvel UK&#x27;s editors. Very few Marvel US comics referenced any of the original characters or major events that occurred within the Marvel UK comics, with an exception being &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; in August 1993.

Nevertheless, in the US, these comics were initially immensely successful, with some issues being reprinted to keep up with demand. Marvel UK massively expanded, and trading cards were made of their characters. During this flush period, Tom DeFalco requested they make a new hero called Red Squirrel Man. An entire sub-imprint called Frontier Comics was created in 1993, patterning itself after DC&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo Comics&quot; and Marvel UK even showed up at the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show in 1993, with staff members dressed as superheroes and Death&#x27;s Head II.

Despite a lineup that included Liam Sharp, Simon Coleby, Bryan Hitch, Carlos Pacheco, Graham Marks, Salvador Larroca, Dan Abnett, and many others, too many titles were launched too quickly in a market which was already swamped by the early 1990s comics boom. In late 1993, Marvel UK would be devastated by the comics market glut and subsequent crash; on September 29, their new Director of Sales, Lou Bank, reported that they were being hurt by &quot;inadequate display of product&quot; at retail &quot;[that] has hindered sale through&quot; and that it was failed there was &quot;simply no room to display&quot; all the comics being made.

&quot;Dark Guard&quot;, &quot;Cyberspace 3000&quot;, &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, &quot;Black Axe&quot;, &quot;Super Soldiers&quot;, and the entire Frontier imprint were cancelled. A large number of projects in the works, from those just proposed to some that had been solicited, were also canceled. The &quot;Red Mist 20:20&quot; crossover was killed so late that &quot;Roid Rage&quot; #1, a &quot;Super Soldiers&quot; spinoff, was canceled while at the printers. Mark Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Loose Cannons&quot; was canceled shortly before it was meant to run (January 1994), despite being almost complete; was later put online by Harrison. Paul Neary told &quot;Comic World&quot; that this was a &quot;trimming of fat&quot; to allow Marvel UK to focus its marketing efforts on &quot;our strongest characters&quot; and claimed the canceled projects would see the light of day in 1994. Two titles that did still run were spinoffs of &quot;Death&#x27;s Head II&quot; in November, with house ads brashly comparing them to other popular comics as part of a marketing strategy to portray the new Marvel UK as a lean, hungry company that could hold its own against the larger (and implicitly duller) competition.

In 1994, Marvel UK had ceased publishing in the US market and was now only printing a handful of titles — mostly reprints — for the UK market, as well as licensed titles like the long-running &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;. &quot;Death&#x27;s Head II&quot; was canceled at #16, of which distributor Capital only sold 7,400 copies. Various creators began looking elsewhere for work and Lou Banks left for Dark Horse Comics. Neary planned a four-title relaunch of their US format line, including &quot;Nocturne&quot; (an updated Night Raven), &quot;The Golden Grenadier&quot;, and new titles for Captain Britain and Death&#x27;s Head. (David Leach&#x27;s proposal for Death&#x27;s Head started as a Third Doctor joke, &quot;that we should completely overhaul him, reduce his power, lose the time travel aspect and set it in present-day England&quot;.) The Golden Grenadier would have been a 1950s superhero, a grenadier guardsman who worked for a secret organisation run by the Queen Mother. The launch never took place.

Eventually, &quot;Nocturne&quot; and &quot;ClanDestine&quot; saw print in America, while &quot;Wild Angels&quot; (a Dark Angel/Wild Thing team-up) was published in Italy in black-and-white format. &quot;Loose Cannons&quot;, a canceled Warheads spin-off about the all-female Virago Troop, and painted by Mark Harrison, was released online in 2005 by its own creator.

=== Panini takeover ===

With the failure of its US titles the company was folded into Marvel&#x27;s Panini Comics business, who at the time was part of Marvel Europe, and had already been reprinting American material across Europe for several years. Casualties of the merger included editor-in-chief Paul Neary and managing director Vincent Conran.

Thanks to this licensing deal, reprints of American Marvel Comics material continued to be published in the UK by Panini from the mid-1990s. They continued printing two existing Marvel UK titles &quot;Astonishing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Essential X-Men&quot; and followed the continuity of the US comics, however it was approximately two–three years behind the current run in America. Each book contained approximately two or three Marvel US strips in one issue with possibly a &quot;classic&quot; comic printed as a substitute for a comic in the current run, whilst being priced at a reasonable level. In addition to this Panini continued &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;.

In addition to reprinting the mainstream US comics, Panini started publishing a monthly (later every three weeks) oversized comic, entitled &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, for younger readers to accompany &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;, which began broadcasting in the UK in the mid-1990s. Initially, the stories were simply reprints of the US comics based on the series, but eventually the title moved to all-new UK-originated stories, marking the first Marvel UK material featuring classic Marvel characters to be produced since early 1994.

Eventually, the Marvel UK logo itself was dropped. One of the final comics to have it was a licensed &quot;Rugrats&quot; comic in May 1996. &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; continued to carry the Marvel UK logo and indicia up to the December 1999 issue (#285), after which it was changed to only Panini UK.

<text>Rune is an action-adventure video game developed by Human Head Studios which was released in 2000. The game is based on Ragnarok, showing the conflict between the Gods Odin and Loki and the buildup to Ragnarok. Built on the Unreal Engine, the game casts the player as Ragnar, a young Viking warrior whose mettle is tested when Loki and his evil allies plot to destroy the world and bring about Ragnarok.

Upon release, &quot;Rune&quot; received generally positive reviews. A standalone expansion pack for the game, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2001. Both the base game and expansion were ported to Linux by Loki Software. Ryan C. Gordon, a former Loki employee, would also later port Human Head&#x27;s 2006 title &quot;Prey&quot;. A port to the PlayStation 2 was also released under the title Rune: Viking Warlord in 2001. The game was re-released digitally under the name &quot;Rune Classic&quot; in 2012, with the expansion included. A sequel, &quot;Rune II&quot;, was released in 2019.

A pen-and-paper adaptation of &quot;Rune&quot; was published by Atlas Games.

== Gameplay ==
The game casts the player as Ragnar, a young Viking warrior. It follows a fantasy plot based on Norse mythology. The various enemies Ragnar faces include man-eating fish, goblins, zombies, Norse dwarves and other Vikings. As the game goes on, as in most games of its type, better weapons are accumulated. Late in the game the player wields weapons of enormous size, even though most weapons maintain their usefulness to the end. Runes are strewn around the game world. When collected, they add to the player&#x27;s rune power.

Weapons in &quot;Rune&quot; are divided into three categories: swords, axes, and maces/hammers. Each of the three classes have five weapons, increasing in size as the game progresses. Each weapon has a unique &quot;Rune Power&quot; that can be activated for a short period of time when the player has enough rune power. Shields may be equipped along with the first three weapons of each class. Weapons of tier 4 and 5 are two-handed, and may not be used along with shields. Besides these standard weapons, other items such as torches and severed limbs may also be equipped to be used as weapons. While high-tier weapons tend to be preferable in singleplayer games, all tiers are considered somewhat equal for multiplayer situations due to balancing factors such as speed.

Depending on the direction of Ragnar&#x27;s movement, weapons can be thrust, swung overhead, or slashed. Repeated strikes unleash a powerful spinning attack. All weapons may be thrown, and deal as much damage when thrown as a melee attack. When Ragnar has killed enough enemies in a short span of time, he enters a brief &quot;Berserk Mode&quot;, which allows him to resist damage and hit harder. There is also a special rune which instantly activates Berserk Mode.

Although rather linear, Ragnar does not need to kill everything in sight (common in games of the time) to travel from one level to the next. In some levels, players have found alternative ways of getting through to the next level. However, particular scripted pawns must be activated (killed, moved or tripped) in key zones to initiate certain actions to continue and move the story along.

=== Multiplayer ===
&quot;Rune&quot; features several multiplayer modes, typical for the time, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and so on. The expansion, Halls of Valhalla, added one unique mode, which is inspired by football; the players are split into team, and score points by dismembering players in the opposing team, picking up their body-parts, and throwing them into the goal. It is a game of spatial orientation in which opponents manoeuvre around each other, swinging in and out of range and attempting to score hits on each other. There are a variety of attacks available to the player at any one time, dictated by the weapon they hold at that moment. The geometries of each swing are immutable – thus players are able to fine tune their movement to the precision of a few pixels, and accurately behead their opponents. Over the years, Rune developed a thriving and competitive clan community, with players from all over the world joining servers, playing together, and forming clans.

== Story ==

The story begins when the player, as Ragnar, is initiated into the Odinsblade, an order of warriors sworn to protect the runestones, magical creations of Odin which bind the evil god, Loki and prevent him from unleashing Ragnarok – the end of the world. Ragnar has completed his initiation by beating the great warrior Ulf in combat, when a warrior bursts into the scene and informs the two that a Viking known as Conrack is leading a raid on an allied village. Ragnar and the rest of his village&#x27;s warriors are assembled into a longship to do battle.

They encounter Conrack&#x27;s longship, and Ragnar&#x27;s father is about to order his men to attack, when Conrack calls upon Loki and destroys the ship with a thunderbolt. The ship sinks, killing all on board but Ragnar, who receives a message from Odin that it is not his time to die. Recovered, he swims to safety in an underwater cave. Ragnar fights his way through the monster-riddled caverns. He eventually enters the land of the dead, domain of Loki&#x27;s daughter Hel.

Passing through the Underworld and facing the ghastly undead, Ragnar learns the enemy&#x27;s plan: Conrack&#x27;s carnage sends many dishonored souls to Hel&#x27;s domain, who in turn gives them to Loki to transform into an army which will conquer the world. After fighting his way through Hel, Ragnar is captured by goblins and fights their beast in the trial pit. He defeats the beast and escapes goblin lands riding on a giant flying beetle. When he emerges from the caverns, he stands before Thorstadt, the mountain fortress of Conrack, and fights his way through it to a Temple of Loki. Inside, Sigurd – Conrack&#x27;s right arm – confronts his master about all the destruction and asks him to drop the charade of worshipping Loki. Conrack states that Sigurd has outlived his usefulness, and sends two of the transformed dishonored to kill him, then escapes. Ragnar enters the scene and stands before the dying warrior. Sigurd informs Ragnar that he is the last of the Odinsblade, and saving the world is up to him, then dies.

Ragnar follows Conrack, and ends up in the land of the Dwarves. In &quot;Rune&quot;, Dwarves are depicted as short, stocky, purple beings. He travels through the industrial powerhouse of the dwarven land and learns that the dwarves are supplying weaponry and armor for Loki&#x27;s new sinister armies. Odin then tasks Ragnar to murder the dwarf king, whose will holds the dwarves&#x27; allegiance to Loki together. The king has apparently proclaimed himself a semi-god, and resides in a great temple dedicated to himself. Ragnar enters battle with the king, and he uses the great machine that gives the king his powers to destroy him.

Ragnar travels deep below the earth and to the castle of Loki himself. Odin tells Ragnar that even he will not be able to contact him whilst he transverses through Loki&#x27;s realm. Ragnar discovers that it is Loki&#x27;s blood that transforms Hel&#x27;s undead warriors to the monsters of Loki&#x27;s armies. He passes through the castle and Loki&#x27;s maze, arriving at the holding chamber of Loki himself. It is here Ragnar faces Conrack at last. Ragnar knocks the rogue Viking into a river of Loki&#x27;s blood, which seems poised to kill him. However, the great stone snake which binds Loki drips acid onto his gaping chest wound and the green blood turns purple. Conrack rises out of the river, reborn in Loki&#x27;s image as a hideous monster. Conrack reveals to Ragnar that Loki&#x27;s armies are invading Midgard and destroying Odin&#x27;s runestones left and right. He escapes with a great leap. After a tussle with some undead, Ragnar dives into the river, emerging as a mighty giant.

Loki tries to persuade Ragnar to join his side. He refuses and goes after Conrack. He escapes from Loki&#x27;s castle and makes his way through caverns out into the world above. He then stands witness to the devastation wrought by Loki&#x27;s armies. Loki mocks him, but he presses on. His fellow warriors no longer recognize him, and attack him on sight. Ragnar finally arrives home, only to see it totally destroyed. Loki offers one last time to join him, and Conrack sends his men forward to destroy the runestone and Ragnar. There are two possible outcomes of the game, depending on what the player does here.

In the canonical good ending, Ragnar bests Conrack and his men. Odin speaks to Ragnar, telling him that the people of his village are safe in the hands of his servant Bragi. He informs Ragnar that he has succeeded and Ragnarok has been averted. Loki, full of bitterness and rage, has his cave filled in by Odin, thwarted for the time being. Odin then opens up a portal in his last runestone, telling Ragnar to step through and join him at his side as the first living warrior to enter Asgard. Complying, Ragnar enters Odin&#x27;s realm and finds himself restored to his human form. Beckoned by Odin, Ragnar runs over Bifröst and enters the Halls of Valhalla.

In the evil ending, Ragnar strides up the hill toward the last runestone and shatters it. As soon as this happens, Loki is freed from his underground prison. The last we see of Ragnar is that he is crucified in Loki&#x27;s lair. Loki then takes over all of Midgard.

== Development ==
The game was developed with a 15 person team. The genesis of &quot;Rune&quot; occurred while Ted Halsted and Shane Gurno were working at Raven Software. Halsted, who had always been fascinated by Vikings, took inspiration from the Icelandic Völsunga saga. Halsted, Gurno and four others left Raven to found Human Head Studios, and soon found work developing a sequel to &quot;Daikatana&quot; using the Unreal Engine. When that project fell through, the Viking idea was revived and work began on &quot;Rune&quot; with the publisher Gathering of Developers.

Epic Games allowed Human Head to keep using the Unreal Engine originally licensed for the &quot;Daikatana&quot; project. The two developers collaboratively made several enhancements to it, including a skeletal animation system, a new particle effects system, and an enhanced shadowing system. Although made using the Unreal Engine, &quot;Rune&quot; is a third-person perspective game without any shooting. The weapons used in the game include swords, axes, maces, and other medieval fantasy melee weapons. Despite using an engine made for shooting, the interface lends itself well to a playing style consisting of running, jumping, and hacking at opponents. Although the game includes no ranged weapons, any weapon can be thrown.

An innovative feature of the game is that anything dropped by a dead opponent (body parts included) can be picked up and used. Limbs can be swung as clubs, and heads can be carried and used as weapons. Enemies whose sword arms have been chopped off will run away from battle.

Both &quot;Rune&quot; and &quot;Rune: Halls of Valhalla&quot; were released with their own &quot;RuneEd&quot; toolkits which the community quickly used making several popular multiplayer mods (coop, CTT—capture the torch, &#x27;bots, etc.). Although a few single player addons have been made, it is &quot;Rune&quot;&#x27;s multiplayer aspect has been the focus of several mutators, skins, and hundreds of maps that are available through many clan and resource websites. In 2004, the source header files were released freely by Human Head.

== Release ==
&quot;Rune&quot; shipped for Windows on October 27, 2000. A playable demo was released at the same time. Developed by Westlake Interactive, the Mac OS version followed on December 4, 2000. Loki Software released a Linux port on June 21, 2001. In October 2001, &quot;Rune&quot; was re-released with the &quot;HOV&quot; expansion included, as &quot;Rune Gold&quot;. A Dreamcast port of the game had been planned, but was eventually cancelled.

Human Head Studios would also feature new multiplayer levels for &quot;Rune&quot; online.

A pen-and-paper adaptation was released by Atlas Games, whom Tim Gerritsen had approached at GenCon.

&quot;Rune&quot;&#x27;s original master server was shut down in 2014 but online play is still possible with community&#x27;s support.

== Reception ==
The original PC version of &quot;Rune&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Critics generally thought the game was good, but not great, and required the player to adjust their expectations. A common point of criticism was the enemy artificial intelligence. Opponents would simply gang up on the player without bothering to use tactics. Enemy variety was also found wanting.

Praise was however given to the graphics, especially the crisp textures, and the detailed limb-hacking violence was appreciated.

The multiplayer was thought middling. Although many appreciated the cathartic fun of running around lopping the heads off other players, the lack of game modes and problems with lag interfered with the enjoyment.

Jim Preston of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game in its February 2001 issue, &quot;&quot;Rune&quot; fails to impress. The shaky gameplay undermines the first-rate visuals and ripping good story.&quot; Brian Wright of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;What &quot;Rune&quot; does offer is a fun, albeit not too original, action/platform-style game with hours and hours of gameplay.&quot;

John Brandon of &quot;GameZone&quot; gave the game a score of eight out of ten, calling it &quot;a brawny game without a huge emphasis on brains – although Viking warriors toward the end of the game are challenging enough. There&#x27;s a lot of visceral, visual enjoyment here – a near-perfect antidote to a long workday.&quot; Michael Tresca of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, &quot;Despite good graphics and excellent sound, &quot;Rune&quot; falls short of its potential due to various flaws, glitches, and a lack of variation over the long haul.&quot; However, Benjamin E. Sones of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that it was &quot;too long and uninspiring to hold your attention. The game would have been far more entertaining with half as many levels. More can be better... but only if it&#x27;s good.&quot;

The game sold 49,000 units in the U.S. by October 2001.

The game was nominated for the Action Game of the Year award at the &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; Computer Game Awards for 2000, which went to &quot;MechWarrior 4: Vengeance&quot;.

== Expansion and PS2 version ==
The &quot;Rune&quot; multiplayer component was expanded with the 2001 release of the stand-alone expansion pack &quot;Rune: Halls of Valhalla&quot;. It adds two new modes: &quot;Head Ball&quot; is a variant of capture the flag with body parts standing in for flags; &quot;Arena&quot; is a duel-centric deathmatch mode. The developers drew inspiration from the violent sport of the Aztecs, in which the losing team of a ball game was decapitated. 37 new maps in total are included: 20 for deathmatch, 8 for Head Ball, and 9 for Arena. Some of these maps were the winners of a four-week competition for fans of the game to create their own maps using the level editor. Sixteen new character models are available, some of them female. The Wren Valkyrie model is based on a fan of &quot;Rune&quot; who ended up getting hired as site director of the official &quot;Rune&quot; website. The soundtrack is also expanded.

&quot;Rune: Viking Warlord&quot; is the PlayStation 2 port of &quot;Rune&quot;, released in 2001 by Take-Two Interactive. It contains a few extra maps and enemies, but is otherwise a straight port. It was released in North America on July 30, 2001 and in the United Kingdom on October 5.

The PlayStation 2 port received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to Metacritic. It was criticized for inferior graphics to the original and long loading times. Whatever their opinion of the multiplayer on PC, critics disliked the multiplayer on PS2. In &quot;NextGen&quot;″s October 2001 issue, Preston called it &quot;Another disc on the already enormous heap of mediocre PS2 games.&quot; Dylan Parrotta of &quot;GameZone&quot; gave it 4.5 out of 10, saying, &quot;Though I could not find a stopwatch I would say that I spent around a quarter of my time in the confines of the load screen.&quot;

== Sequel ==
Human Head was considering a sequel as early as 2000. Rune II had been negotiated with an unnamed publisher during the early-to-mid-2000s. In 2012, Human Head Studios indicated that it was considering making a sequel to &quot;Rune&quot;. A sequel titled &quot;Rune: Ragnarok&quot; was announced to be in production by Human Head in August 2017. In March 2018, the &quot;Ragnarok&quot; subtitle was dropped and the title was renamed &quot;Rune&quot;. By May 2019, Human Head renamed the title again as &quot;Rune II&quot;, with a target release for Windows in mid-2019 through the Epic Games Store. The partnership with Epic Games enabled Human Head to acquire additional funding to finish out their more expansive version of the game, according to studio head Chris Rhinehart.

The game was pushed back and was released on November 12, 2019, under publisher Ragnarok Game LLC. Immediately after the game&#x27;s release, Human Head Studios was shuttered and a new studio, Roundhouse Studios, was formed with the staff of Human Head Studios under management with Bethesda Softworks. Ragnarok stated they were unaware of Human Head&#x27;s closure until that day but remained committed to providing ongoing support and releases outside Epic Games Store through 2020. By December 2019, Ragnarok had filed a lawsuit against the former Human Head staff for failing to provide the final source code and assets for &quot;Rune II&quot; following the studio&#x27;s surprise closure upon their request, as well as in damages relating to the poor state in which &quot;Rune II&quot; was released at launch and to cover the game&#x27;s post-launch support period which Human Head was to have done. Ragnarok had received the source code back from the former Human Head staff by January 2020, but still intend to follow through with the lawsuit. By October 2020, Ragnarok had expanded the lawsuit to include both ZeniMax and Bethesda as parties to the suit, alleging they had defrauded Ragnarok and sabotaged the development of two games.

<text>The Division of Hinkler is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It includes the city of Bundaberg and its surrounds. The most recent member for Hinkler is Keith Pitt of the National Party who served between 2013-2025.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History== 

The division was created in 1984 and is named after Bert Hinkler, the great pioneer Australian aviator.

The seat is located in coastal Queensland, including the towns of Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Childers, Gayndah and Monto.

The electoral division had previously centred on Gladstone and its surrounding area. On those boundaries, it was a marginal seat that traded hands between the Australian Labor Party and the National Party of Australia. However, after a redistribution in 2006, the Gladstone area, a Labor bastion, was transferred to the Division of Flynn. This seemingly consolidated the Nationals&#x27; hold on the seat. While National incumbent Paul Neville was nearly swept out in 2007 due in part to Queensland swinging heavily to Labor under Kevin Rudd, he survived in part due to Labor-leaning Gladstone being replaced with conservative-leaning Hervey Bay. He was reelected with a large enough swing in 2010 to turn Hinkler into a safe seat for the merged Liberal National Party.

<doc id="1218917" wikidata="Q16935628" url="?curid=1218917" title="Round table (furniture)">
<text>A round table is a table which has no &quot;head&quot; and no &quot;sides&quot;, and therefore no one person sitting at it is given a privileged position and all are treated as equals. The idea stems from the Arthurian legend about the Knights of the Round Table in Camelot.

Today, round tables are often used at conferences involving many parties. The most famous modern round table was the one used for talks between the Communist government and Solidarity in Poland in 1989; see: Polish Round Table Agreement. Hence, the term &quot;round table&quot; is also used figuratively to refer to a peaceful way of achieving a compromise solution.

<doc id="1218922" wikidata="Q310181" url="?curid=1218922" title="Martin Jol">
<text>Maarten Cornelis &quot;Martin&quot; Jol (born 16 January 1956) is a Dutch football manager and former midfielder. He played over 400 games during his career which included spells in the Netherlands, Germany and England, as well as earning three caps with the Netherlands national team. He subsequently became a manager and has worked for Roda JC, RKC Waalwijk and Ajax in his homeland, as well as German Bundesliga club Hamburger SV and English Premier League clubs Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham and Egypt&#x27;s Al Ahly.

==Playing career==
Jol was born in The Hague. He started his playing career with an amateur team before joining the local professional side ADO Den Haag. He turned professional with Den Haag in 1973. He won the 1975 Dutch Cup with the team defeating Twente. He played in the Bundesliga for the 1978–79 season with Bayern Munich before returning to the Dutch Eredivisie to play for Twente in 1979. While with Twente, he won his first cap for the Netherlands national football team in October 1980. Jol moved to England in 1981, joining West Bromwich Albion. He appeared in the semi-finals of both domestic cup competitions in 1981–82. He signed for Coventry City in 1984 but wanted to leave the club after manager Bobby Gould was asked to leave. Jol returned to Den Haag in 1985, and won the 1985 &quot;Dutch Footballer of the Year&quot; award in the Eerste Divisie league.

At international level, Jol won ten schoolboy caps, 20 &#x27;B&#x27; caps, 12 Under-21 caps and 12 Under-23 caps. He also made three appearances for the senior team, and competed at the 1980 Mundialito held in Uruguay.

==Coaching career==

===Early career in the Netherlands===
Jol&#x27;s coaching career began in 1991 when he took over at the amateur side ADO Den Haag and took them to the highest local amateur division. Jol then moved to the leading local amateur side Scheveningen for one season, where he won the national non-league championship. Jol then spent two years as manager at the professional Eredivisie side Roda JC from the town of Kerkrade, during which time he won the Dutch Cup in 1997, Roda&#x27;s first trophy for 30 years. Between 1998 and 2004, Jol managed the Dutch professional team RKC Waalwijk. He started there in November with only three points at the bottom of the table. He saved them from relegation in their first year and was in contention for European football in the years after. He was honoured with the Dutch Football Writers Coach of the Year 2001 and with the Dutch Players and Coaches Coach of the Year 2002 awards.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
RKC Waalwijk denied reports in June 2004 that Jol was about to become assistant manager of Tottenham Hotspur. Several days later, however, Jol was given the job under Tottenham&#x27;s new coach, Jacques Santini, having been recruited by Tottenham&#x27;s sporting director Frank Arnesen. Santini resigned from the manager&#x27;s job after just 13 games, and on 8 November 2004, Jol was confirmed as his replacement. In his first season in charge, Jol improved their league fortunes and scrapped the defensive nature of play that Santini had instilled. After winning five league games in a row, Tottenham&#x27;s best run of form since the 1992–1993 season, he won the FA Manager of the Month award in December 2004 and was strongly linked in the press with the then vacant managerial job at Ajax of Amsterdam. Jol, however, ruled out moving clubs early. Jol led Tottenham to the verge of European qualification but the season ended with a ninth-place finish in the Premier League after a final day draw at home to Blackburn Rovers. This meant Spurs missed out on the UEFA Cup spot by two points. In August 2005, he signed a new three-year contract with Tottenham.

Tottenham warmed up for the 2005–06 season by winning the pre-season tournament the Peace Cup, which featured such clubs as PSV, Lyon, Boca Juniors; Tottenham defeated Lyon in the final. Although Tottenham went out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle, they never once dropped out of the top six places in the league, and for much of the season, Tottenham sat in fourth place, a UEFA Champions League spot. On the final day of the season, however, Tottenham&#x27;s squad was struck down by illness and Spurs were defeated by West Ham United, meaning they missed out on Champions League qualification and finished in fifth place. Nevertheless, Jol had led Tottenham to their highest league finish since 1990, which meant they had qualified for the UEFA Cup via the league for the first time since the ban on English clubs playing in Europe was lifted in 1990. The season saw Tottenham concede just 38 league goals, the fewest the club has conceded since 1971.

The 2006–07 season saw Jol end Tottenham&#x27;s lengthy hoodoo against Chelsea with a win, the first against them in the league since 1990. In the Football League Cup, they were knocked-out in the semi-finals by rivals Arsenal. A 4–0 FA Cup win away to Fulham, however, kick-started a run of form which saw Tottenham take 27 points from their final 12 league games, losing just once. This run saw Spurs surge into fifth place, securing UEFA Cup qualification on the final day of the season, making Jol the first Spurs manager since Keith Burkinshaw to qualify for European football in successive seasons. Tottenham also reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup and the FA Cup, losing to the eventual winners in both.

In the summer of 2007, Tottenham signed a number of expensive players spending around £40 million. It has been reported that some of these players were signed on the request of Director of Football Damien Comolli and that Jol was not allowed to select players he wanted to buy, such as Martin Petrov. When the suggestion of selling star striker Dimitar Berbatov arose, Jol claimed, &quot;I&#x27;d rather die.&quot;

Because of the large amount of money that had been spent, Spurs were expected by the board to challenge for a top four place in the 2007–08 season. After Tottenham lost their opening two games, however, Club Secretary John Alexander and Director Paul Kemsley were photographed in a Spanish hotel with Sevilla manager Juande Ramos, who then claimed that Tottenham had made him a &quot;dizzying offer&quot; to become their manager, though this was denied by Tottenham&#x27;s chairman Daniel Levy. This undermined Jol&#x27;s position, and he was eventually sacked by the Tottenham board on 25 October 2007 during their 2–1 defeat to Getafe in the UEFA Cup. News of the sacking was widely known around the ground before the final whistle, before even Jol had become aware of his fate. Jol confessed that he first became aware of the decision when his nephew told him of a text message he received saying Jol was to leave the job.

Jol rejected an approach from Birmingham City to discuss their managerial vacancy in November 2007, but was reported at the time as interested in returning to Premiership football to manage one of the clubs outside the &quot;top four.&quot;
===Hamburg===
From the 2008–09 season, Jol began coaching German Bundesliga club Hamburger SV. Hamburg was at the top of the league standings and ended up finishing in fifth place, qualifying for the Europa League for the following season. Hamburg also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup and the German League Cup, which were both lost against Werder Bremen. This was the first time since the 1980s that Hamburg reached the semi-finals in both competitions.

===Ajax===
On 26 May 2009, it was announced that Jol was to be the new head coach of Ajax, taking over from Marco van Basten, who resigned at the end of the season. Jol showed his happiness at returning to his home country and on 28 May 2009, he officially signed a three-year contract.

After winning their opening two games of the season, Jol&#x27;s Ajax lost away to PSV and then drew with Sparta Rotterdam at home, a result that saw them slip down to seventh place in the Eredivisie. This was the only game, however, in which they dropped points at home all season. They ended the season with the league&#x27;s strongest defence and the fewest league goals conceded by any Dutch team in five years, including just four conceded at home all season. Even more remarkably, they scored 106 league goals – an average of more than three per game – the most any Dutch side has scored since the 1997–98 season. This meant that Ajax ended the season with a goal difference of +86. PSV, who had the next best goal difference in the league, had only half of this with +43.

Jol&#x27;s side did not drop a single point after January, winning their final 14 games of the season. This meant that they finished with 85 points, a 17-point improvement on the previous season and a tally that would have been enough to win the league in all but two of the seasons since 1995, when the rules of the Eredivisie changed to award three points for a win instead of two. They were beaten to the title by one point, however, by Steve McClaren&#x27;s Twente, who won their first-ever Eredivisie title.

Jol had some consolation for the season, winning the Dutch Cup, his first trophy since winning the same competition 13 years earlier with Roda JC, by beating Feyenoord 6–1 on aggregate in the first two-leg final since 1983. During the summer of 2010, Jol was the subject of an unsuccessful attempt by Fulham to make him their new manager; Ajax refused to let him leave the club. In the same month, Jol led Ajax to the Champions League, for the first time since the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League. On 6 December 2010, Jol resigned as manager of Ajax with immediate effect after a 1–1 home draw to NEC Nijmegen that left the Amsterdam-based club in fourth place, with a five-point distance from the top of the league, after 17 games. Ajax would go on to win the Eredivisie championship under new manager Frank de Boer.

===Fulham===
On 7 June 2011, it was announced that Jol had signed a two-year contract to take up the vacant post at Premier League side Fulham, after Mark Hughes&#x27; departure. He joined the club almost a year after nearly becoming their manager before Hughes&#x27; appointment. &quot;I am very happy to join Fulham. It is a club with good, solid foundations and a great fan base,&quot; he said. &quot;I am looking forward to being part of the Fulham family and thank the chairman for the trust shown in me.&quot; Jol&#x27;s first game in charge of Fulham was the UEFA Europa League first round first leg against Faroese side NSÍ Runavík on 30 June 2011, Fulham winning 3–0. Jol&#x27;s first Premier League game in charge was at home against Aston Villa on 13 August 2011, the game ending in a 0–0 draw. In his first season with the club, he led them to ninth place in the Premier League, collecting 52 points, one point off of Fulham&#x27;s record points tally in the top division. They claimed some notable scalps during the season, including victories over Arsenal, Newcastle United, and Liverpool, plus a credible 2–2 draw against eventual league champions Manchester City. They also earned two solid draws against London rivals Chelsea and beat local rivals Queens Park Rangers first 6–0 at home and then 1–0 away.

It had been reported that during the first half of the season, Jol had fallen out with striker Bobby Zamora. Zamora subsequently left Fulham to go to QPR and join up with former Fulham manager Mark Hughes. Collectively, it was a successful first season for Jol, as Fulham finished only 12 points and three places outside of Europa League qualification.

In the second season Fulham finished 12th place and Jol extended his contract for another year until 30 June 2014. Jol was sacked as Fulham manager on 1 December 2013 after six successive defeats in all competitions, the last of which a 3–0 defeat to West Ham in which Fulham failed to register a single shot on target.

===Al Ahly===
On 24 February 2016, Jol was appointed as the new coach of the Egyptian Premier League club, Al-Ahly. On 19 August 2016, Jol was sacked because of his bad performance in the 2016 CAF Champions League competition. On 20 August 2016, Ahly SC made a farewell party to thank Jol and to celebrate the premier league achievement.

<doc id="1218923" wikidata="Q926700" url="?curid=1218923" title="Oeiras, Portugal">
<text>Oeiras () is a town and municipality in the western part of Lisbon metropolitan area, located within the Portuguese Riviera, in continental Portugal. The municipality is part of the urban agglomeration of Lisbon and the town of Oeiras is about 16 km from Lisbon downtown. The population in 2011 was 172,120 living in an area of 45.88 km2, making the municipality the fifth-most densely populated in Portugal.

Oeiras is an important economic hub, being one of the most highly developed municipalities of Portugal and Europe. It has the highest GDP per capita in the country, being also the second highest-ranking municipality (immediately after Lisbon) in terms of purchasing power as well as the second highest-ranking in the country as far as tax collection is concerned. These economic indicators also reflect the education level of its inhabitants, as Oeiras is the municipality with the highest concentration of population by tertiary education attainment in the country, their entrepreneurial prowess and the economically liberal mindset of Oeiras&#x27; society in general. It also has the lowest unemployment rate in the Lisbon area.

==History==

The mild climate, access to water, quality of its soils and geographically advantageous location at the mouth of the Tagus River attracted early settlement to this region. The rugged hilltops of the interior conditioned cultivation and allowed the settlement of several small agricultural castros within the region&#x27;s limits, such as Castro of Leceia (which was classified in 1963 as a property of public interest). This archaeological site is a witness to the early settlements and defensive structures that developed during the Chalcolithic period, although Paleolithic camps such as &quot;Gruta da Ponte da Laje&quot; are indicative of earlier settlements.

Remnants of the Roman occupation of the Iberian peninsula are evident in many places throughout the municipality, including mosaics, specifically along the &quot;Rua das Alcássimas&quot;, and a Roman bridge. The later Arab conquest left behind several toponymic markers, including Arab/Moorish place names such as Alcássimas, Algés, Alpendroado and Quinta da Moura.

===Kingdom era===
The settlement of Oeiras dates back to 1208, when the area was colonized by Christians arrived from northern lands of the Kingdom of Portugal who were moving south into warmer agricultural lands during the process of Reconquista (reconquest of ancient Visigothic Kingdom’s territory occupied by Muslim invaders since the 8th century).

At the beginning of the Age of Discoveries, Oeiras became the industrial and commercial warehouse of Lisbon. The development of the Gunpowder Factory () in Barcarena was therefore important in the expansion of the Portuguese dominions of the Orient, in addition to the aggregate extraction and calcium oxide furnaces in Paço de Arcos. These industries were supported and guarded by the construction of several fortifications along a maritime defensive line that ringed the southern coast to Lisbon and that controlled navigation in the Tagus estuary from the 16th to 18th centuries. This perimeter included the Fort of São Lourenço da Cabeça Seca (also known as the Lighthouse or Tower of Bugio), rising from a tiny islet in the middle of the Tagus River, as well as the Fort of São Julião da Barra, both examples of Renaissance military architecture.

The municipality was founded in 1759 by the Marquis of Pombal on an area granted as a reward by King Joseph I to his minister for his efforts in rebuilding Lisbon&#x27;s historical downtown () after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. A royal charter, dated 7 June 1759, gave jurisdiction over the lands within Oeiras to the King&#x27;s loyal minister, who became the first Count of Oeiras. A month later, the small village was elevated to the status of town, and then gained municipal status on 13 June 1759. Although Oeiras had a history of earlier settlement, it was during the reign of Joseph I that economic and social development, conditioned by the influence of the King&#x27;s Minister, who promoted innovation and supported local economic activities, began to flourish.

In 1770, the first agricultural and industrial fair was established in Oeiras, representing a unique national event that also contributed to the creation of fishing shelters and a new customs house and factory, among other projects. One of the principal developments was the construction of the estate of the Marquess of Pombal, which today exists in its original form, with garden, palace and agricultural dependencies, such as the wine cellar, barn and other buildings, today housing the national institutions responsible for bio-science.

In 1894, the municipality was abolished, but it was reestablished four years later on 13 January 1898. It was reconstituted without Carcavelos, which was annexed to Cascais, while gaining the civil parish of Benfica. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, several estates and palaces began to be constructed in order to explore agricultural production, principally cereals and vineyards, which supported the growing markets of Lisbon. However, this activity began to decline by the 19th century and was replaced by new industry, supported by the Lisbon-Cascais railway link, first inaugurated in 1889. Large factories began to locate in the municipality, among them the &quot;Fábrica do Papel&quot;, the &quot;Fundição de Oeiras&quot;, a Lusalite and &quot;Fermentos Holandeses&quot;.

===20th century===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the growth of leisure activities along the coast transformed Oeiras, which became a privileged location for the Portuguese elite. 

By the beginning of the 20th century, many of the beaches in Oeiras were already occupied by the higher social classes, who travelled to the municipality for medical reasons (believing the air and beach-waters were therapeutic). The construction of National Roadway 6 (EN6) would later link Lisboa to Cascais, permitting new travellers to experience the area, resulting in an influx of new residents that expanded the urban centres, giving rise to beach &quot;chalets&quot; and summer cottages. Simultaneously, the concentration of economic activities in Lisbon and surrounding urban municipalities meant that Oeiras had direct access to the capital.

After 1940–50, the municipality began to function as a suburb and bedroom community, attracting more residential growth along the coast. This culminated in the 1970s with the appearance of illegal urban settlements, squatters and barrios. Until the 1980s, the municipality was dependent on the much larger urban centre for development.

By the end of the 1980s, however, Oeiras began to constitute its own economic pole in the Lisbon metropolitan area, concentrating its development on tertiary activities linked to science, investigation, information technology and communications. At the end of the 20th century, the municipality became known for its high standard of living, leaving behind its image as a suburb of Lisbon and assuming an important position as a centre associated with new technologies (with the establishment of various technology parks, such as Taguspark and LagoasPark) and service industries. The elevated standard of living and work allowed the region to obtain several awards, including the &quot;Melhor Concelho para Trabalhar&quot; (&#x27;Best Municipality to Work&#x27;), &quot;Município de excelência&quot; (&#x27;Municipal Excellence&#x27; Award), European Enterprise Award and the ECOXXI Award.

==Geography==

The municipality is located along the northern margin and mouth of the Tagus River, across from the municipality of Almada, surrounded by the municipalities of Lisbon (east), Sintra (north), Amadora (northeast) and Cascais (west).

Administratively, the municipality is divided into five civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Algés, Linda-a-Velha e Cruz Quebrada-Dafundo
* Barcarena
* Carnaxide e Queijas
* Oeiras e São Julião da Barra, Paço de Arcos e Caxias
* Porto Salvo

Along the 10 km coastline, where the Tagus River meets the ocean, several natural coves were at the origin of its beaches:
* Praia da Torre
* Praia de Santo Amaro de Oeiras
* Praia de Paço de Arcos
* Praia de Caxias
Two major green areas spread over Oeiras municipality: the &quot;Estação Agronómica Nacional&quot; and the Jamor sports complex.

===Climate===
Oeiras has a Mediterranean climate with warm to hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters with less precipitation and slightly smoother variations in temperature than the nearby city of Lisbon.

== Demographics ==

Oeiras municipality had a population of 172,120 at the 2011 census, remaining the nation&#x27;s 11th most populous municipality and the 5th greatest in terms of population density.

The major expansion in the municipality&#x27;s demographics, like those of the other municipalities that circle Lisbon, occurred in the second half of the 20th century. Realizing this growth, and understanding that there was a need to control urban sprawl, in 1948 the &quot;Plano de Urbanização da Costa do Sol&quot; (&#x27;Sun Coast Urbanization Plan&#x27;) was adopted to manage this activities in the northern margin of the Tagus. This remained active until 1994, when the first &quot;Plano Director Municipal&quot; (&#x27;Municipal Plan&#x27;) was adopted.

Demographically, the population is divided into 52.6% women to 47.4% men, with the majority of its resident population in the cohort between 25 and 64 years of age (approximately 92,978 inhabitants). Rounding out these numbers, there are 24,153 seniors over the age of 65 and 22,685 residents less than 14 years of age. Oeiras has the highest concentration of bachelor&#x27;s and PhD degrees in the country, as well as the highest percentage of graduates in the country: 26%.
==Economy==


The industrialized and heavily commercial municipality is occupied by several facilities, which include the headquarters of SIC and TVI (two major Portuguese television networks), as well as main operational offices, research units, subsidiaries and branches of many large multinational companies, including Google, Nestlé, McDonald&#x27;s, BP, General Electric, Cisco, Synopsys, P&amp;G, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Epson, Samsung, LG, Unit4, Philips, Intel, Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson &amp; Johnson, L&#x27;Oréal, Oracle, Atlas Copco, ABB, Daikin, Nike, Nissan, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Grundfos, Merck &amp; Co, NetJets Europe, Synopsys, Miele, Unisys, BMW, Toshiba, Canon, GSK, Volvo Cars, and Stellantis. The headquarters of Omni Aviation and its Portuguese subsidiary airline White Airways are also located in the area.

The municipality is also a business incubator due to the purposeful creation of many science, technology, research and business parks and centers, including:

* Arquiparque
* Lagoas Park
* Miraflores Premium
* Neo Park
* Parque Holanda
* Parque Suécia
* Quinta da Fonte
* Taguspark - Science and Technology Park
* Tagus Space

Several not-for-profit private and governmental institutions are also headquartered within the vicinity of Oeiras town. These include the principal naval service command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#x27;s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO); IGC - Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, and a branch of the Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos, responsible for agrarian research, the Estação Agronómica Nacional (National Agronomy Station), which are all located within the municipality of Oeiras.

The first Portuguese semiconductor company, Chipidea, founded in 1997, was established in Oeiras until being acquired by MIPS Technologies for $147 million in 2007. On May 8, 2009, Synopsys acquired it as the Analog Business Group from MIPS Technologies for $22 million in cash.

==Main sights==

Oeiras offers a range of points of interest, ranging from monuments of unique and historical value, such as the Palace of Marquês de Pombal and Palace of the Royal Estate in Caxias (that dates from the 18th century and surrounded by luxurious gardens) to sites with industrial history, like the &quot;Fábrica da Pólvora de Barcarena&quot; (&#x27;Barcarena Gunpowder Factory&#x27;), a reclaimed arms factory used for leisure and cultural purposes.

Leisure facilities include the sports complex of Jamor, Oeiras&#x27; promenade (linking Algés and Oeiras e São Julião da Barra) and the yacht harbour, in addition to other local parks and green spaces. The modern &quot;Parque dos Poetas&quot; (&#x27;Poets&#x27; Park&#x27;), a green space with statues of Portuguese poets and writers, is also one of the &quot;ex-libris&quot; of Oeiras. Many of the former town centres have been recovered, displaying monuments and tourist-oriented venues for leisure, cultural, gastronomic and social events (for example the town of Paço de Arcos).

The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It is named after Edmund Kennedy, an explorer in the area where the division is located in Queensland.

The member since 1993 is Bob Katter Jr., the leader of Katter&#x27;s Australian Party. He was previously elected as a member of the National Party, but became an independent in 2001 before forming his own party in 2011.

Geographically, the electorate is rural. It takes in the Pacific coast of Queensland between Cairns and Townsville, including a small portion of Cairns itself, before sweeping westward to take in most of Queensland&#x27;s northern outback—a large, increasingly sparsely populated area stretching west to the border with the Northern Territory. The largest population centre in the electorate is the city of Mount Isa, in its far west. Until 1949, the electorate was even larger, encompassing most of the state north of Townsville, becoming still larger when it absorbed Cairns in 1934. However, much of its northern portion, including the Cairns area, became the Division of Leichhardt in 1949.

Kennedy was held by the Australian Labor Party for most of the first half of the 20th century, and was one of the few country seats where Labor consistently did well. From Federation until 1966, Labor held it for all but two terms. However, since 1966 it has been held by the conservative Katter family—Bob Sr. and his son, Bob Jr.—for all but one term. It has long since shaken off its Labor past, and is now often colloquially nicknamed &#x27;Katter Country&#x27;. A few Labor pockets still exist in Mount Isa, which was represented by Labor at the state level as late as 2012, as well as around Cairns and Townsville. However, they are no match for the heavily conservative bent of the rest of the seat, which is now considered one of the most overall conservative in Australia.

Besides the Katters, other prominent members include Charles McDonald, the first Labor Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, and Bill Riordan, a minister in the Chifley government.

Darby Riordan held the seat from 1929 until his death in 1936. His nephew, Bill, won the seat at the ensuing by-election and held it until his retirement in 1966. Bob Katter Sr. won it in the 1966 Coalition landslide, holding it until 1990. His son and current member, Bob Jr. defeated his father&#x27;s successor, Rob Hulls, in 1993. Hulls would later become Deputy Premier of Victoria.

Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

At the 2013 election, sitting member Bob Jr. faced his first serious contest in two decades. He&#x27;d gone into the election holding Kennedy with a margin of 18 per cent, making Kennedy the second-safest seat in Australia. However, Liberal National candidate Noeline Ikin was well ahead on the primary vote by 10,000 votes. Katter narrowly pulled through and won another term on Labor preferences. However, he suffered a swing of 17 per cent, reducing his majority to only 2.19 per cent.

Katter did not however face a rematch against Ikin at the 2016 election due to her having a brain tumour which forced her out of the election. (The tumour ultimately claimed Ikin&#x27;s life in 2017.)
At that election, Katter picked up a swing of almost nine per cent, making it a safe seat once again.

Kennedy was one of the 17 (out of 150) electorates that voted ‘no’ in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.

<text>Karlsruher Virtueller Katalog (KVK) is a book search engine administered by the library of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. It was developed by KIT-Library in 1996 and continuously expanded and adapted since. It searches a large number of catalogs of research libraries and consortia in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, as well as important consortia and national library catalogs in other countries. Beyond that it also searches open access and digital media search engines and catalogs. It is said to encompass more than 600 million books and serial publications.

==Technology==
In order to be able to search many catalogs at the same time, the KVK team has created a CGI program, which initially reformulates the terms entered in the KVK search form for each of the target catalogs according to their requirements. For each WWW search interface of the target catalogs, a structure description file is provided which allows entry into the CGI program. The structure description file describes the structure of the respective search form and the structure of the resulting hit lists. Important information about the search form is the names of the WWW server, the search fields, and the CGI program of the target catalog that performs the search. The CGI program of the KVK then transfers the search queries in the KVK in the correct syntax to the correct fields of the target catalog. Important elements of the hit list are the short titles of the hits and the URL links to the full title dis.

<text>Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is a manufacturing process, used to reduce the porosity of metals and increase the density of many ceramic materials. This improves the material&#x27;s mechanical properties and workability. 

The HIP process subjects a component to both elevated temperature and isostatic gas pressure within a high-pressure containment vessel, unlike the cold isostatic pressing (CIP), where the component is maintained at room temperature. The pressurizing gas most widely used is argon. An inert gas is used so that the material does not chemically react. The choice of metal can minimize negative effects of chemical reactions. Nickel, stainless or mild steel, or other metals can be chosen depending on the desired redox conditions. The chamber is heated, causing the pressure inside the vessel to increase. Many systems use associated gas pumping to achieve the necessary pressure level. Pressure is applied to the material from all directions (hence the term &quot;isostatic&quot;).

For processing castings, metal powders can also be turned to compact solids by this method, the inert gas is applied between and , with being most common. Process soak temperatures range from for aluminium castings to for nickel-based superalloys. When castings are treated with HIP, the simultaneous application of heat and pressure eliminates internal voids and microporosity through a combination of plastic deformation, creep, and diffusion bonding; this process improves fatigue resistance of the component. Primary applications are the reduction of microshrinkage, the consolidation of powder metals, ceramic composites and metal cladding. Hot isostatic pressing is thus also used as part of a sintering (powder metallurgy) process and for fabrication of metal matrix composites,
often being used for postprocessing in additive manufacturing.

The process can be used to produce waste form classes. Calcined radioactive waste (waste with additives) is packed into a thin walled metal canister. The adsorbed gases are removed with high heat and the remaining material compressed to full density using argon gas during the heat cycle. This process can shrink steel canisters to minimize space in disposal containers and during transport. It was invented in the 1950s at the Battelle Memorial Institute and has been used to prepare nuclear fuel for submarines since the 1960s. It is used to prepare inactive ceramics as well, and the Idaho National Laboratory has validated it for the consolidation of radioactive ceramic waste forms. ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) is using HIP as part of a process to immobilize waste radionuclides from molybdenum-99 production.

<doc id="1218943" wikidata="Q3048768" url="?curid=1218943" title="The Public Theater">
<text>The Public Theater is an arts organization in New York City. Founded by Joseph Papp, The Public Theater was originally the Shakespeare Workshop in 1954; its mission was to support emerging playwrights and performers. Its first production was the musical &quot;Hair&quot; in 1967. Since Papp, the theater has been led by JoAnne Akalaitis (1991–1993), and George C. Wolfe (1993–2004), and is currently under Artistic Director Oskar Eustis and Executive Director Patrick Willingham.

The Public&#x27;s headquarters is located at 425 Lafayette Street in the former Astor Library in Lower Manhattan. The building contains five theater spaces, and Joe&#x27;s Pub, a cabaret-style venue for new work, musical performances, spoken-word artists, and soloists. Additionally, The Public operates the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, where it has staged &quot;Shakespeare in the Park&quot; performances free of charge since 1954.

Recent productions include: &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (2010); &quot;Here Lies Love&quot; (2013); &quot;Fun Home&quot; (2013); &quot;Eclipsed&quot; (2015); and &quot;Hamilton&quot; (2015).

==Programs and series==
In addition to each season of full-scale theatrical productions, The Public produces several different series, festivals, and programs each year.

The Public presented its inaugural Public LAB series in 2008 with an annual series of new plays presented in collaboration with LAByrinth Theater Company. With each Public LAB show, the corresponding speaker series is presented as after-show talkbacks to discuss prominent themes, ideas, and topics in the plays. Several plays that have appeared in the Public LAB series have gone onto full-scale productions, including Tracey Scott Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Good Negro&quot;, which ran at The Public in 2009, and &quot;Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson&quot;, which had a sold-out, thrice-extended off-Broadway run at The Public in spring 2010 and transferred to Broadway that fall.

In 2011, Public LAB expanded to include Public LAB SHAKESPEARE, which is a new platform for The Public&#x27;s exploration of the Shakespeare canon. This expansion marks the growth of The Public&#x27;s Shakespeare Initiative and provides more ways for The Public to produce American interpretations of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. The first production of Public LAB SHAKESPEARE was &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; in March 2011, with Richard Thomas playing the title role.

Since 2013, The Public&#x27;s Mobile Unit has been bringing free Shakespeare performances to various locations throughout New York City&#x27;s five boroughs, including prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers. The tour concludes at the Public Theater, having previously performed at notable venues such as Rikers Island, Borden Avenue&#x27;s Veteran&#x27;s Shelter, and The Fortune Society. The Public also launched its inaugural Public Works production in 2013. Public Works combines diverse groups of people throughout the five boroughs of New York City to watch theater, participate in theatrical workshops, and perform in one full-scale Public Works production alongside professional actors at Shakespeare in the Park. Past Public Works productions include &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;.

The Public Forum, begun in 2010, is a series of lectures, debates, and conversations that showcase leading voices in the arts, politics and the media. Curated by Jeremy McCarter, a senior writer at &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Public Forum events explore issues raised by plays in The Public&#x27;s season, as well as the political and cultural headlines of today&#x27;s world. Notable participants in the series include Stephen Sondheim, Tony Kushner, Arianna Huffington, Alec Baldwin and Anne Hathaway.

The Public hosts the annual Under the Radar Festival, a festival tracking new theater from around the world.

Over the last 12 years, The Public&#x27;s Under the Radar Festival (UTR) has presented over 194 companies from 40 countries. UTR has presented works by such artists as Elevator Repair Service, Gob Squad, Belarus Free Theatre, and Young Jean Lee.

The Public serves as the home of the Emerging Writers Group, which seeks to target playwrights at the earliest stages in their careers. The Emerging Writers Group is a component of The Public Writers Initiative.

The Public also fosters Public Studio, a performance series dedicated to developing the works of new and emerging theater artists. Emerging playwrights get the opportunity to stage a piece somewhere between a workshop and a full production in front of an audience, as an opportunity to gage audience reaction and further develop their work.

The Public Theater invests in theater education, training classical actors through the annual summer acting intensive known as the Shakespeare Lab. The Shakespeare Lab is The Public Theater&#x27;s professional actor development program that immerses a selected company of professional, mid-career actors in a summer intensive exploring the rigors, challenges, and joys of performing Shakespeare.

The Public Theater hosts educational programs for teenagers such as Shakespeare Spring Break, Summer ShakeUP, and A Midsummer Day&#x27;s Camp programs, all for teenagers interested in learning about and performing Shakespeare.

Suzan-Lori Parks, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Master Writer Chair of The Public, debuted her performance piece &quot;Watch Me Work&quot; as part of the 2011 Under The Radar Festival. In the performance, Parks worked on her newest writing project in the main lobby of The Public Theater.

==Notable works and awards==
A number of The Public&#x27;s productions have moved to larger Broadway theaters upon the conclusion of their run at Astor Place. The three most commercially successful of these works have been &quot;Hair&quot; (1967), &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; (1975), and &quot;Hamilton&quot; (2015).

The Public Theater has won 54 Tony Awards, 152 Obie Awards, 42 Drama Desk Awards and five Pulitzer Prizes. Fifty-five Public Theater productions have moved to Broadway, including &quot;Sticks and Bones&quot;, &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Bring in &#x27;da Noise, Bring in &#x27;da Funk&quot;, Michael John LaChiusa&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, &quot;The Ride Down Mt. Morgan&quot;, &quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot;, &quot;Take Me Out&quot;, &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot;, &quot;Passing Strange&quot;, the revival of &quot;HAIR&quot;, &quot;Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;, &quot;Well&quot;, &quot;Fun Home&quot;, &quot;Hamilton&quot;, and &quot;Eclipsed&quot;.

==Astor Library Building==

The Public has been housed in a landmarked Romanesque revival structure at 425 Lafayette Street since 1967, built between 1853 and 1881 as the Astor Library, which later merged with the Tilden and Lenox collections to become the New York Public Library. The library was built by William B. Astor, son of the library&#x27;s founder, John Jacob Astor. A German-born architect, Alexander Saeltzer, who had been the architect of the Anshe Chesed Synagogue,
 designed the building in Rundbogenstil style, then the prevailing style for public building in Germany. Astor funded two expansions of the building toward Astor Place, designed by Griffith Thomas (1856–1869) and Thomas Stent (1879–1881). Both large expansions followed Saeltzer&#x27;s original design so seamlessly that an observer cannot detect that the edifice was built in three stages.

In 1920, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society purchased the building. By 1965, it was in disuse and faced demolition. The Public Theater, then the New York Shakespeare Festival, persuaded the city to purchase it for use as a theater. It was converted for theater use by Giorgio Cavaglieri between 1967 and 1976.

The building is a New York City Landmark, designated in 1965. It was one of the first buildings to be recognized as such by the newly formed Landmarks Preservation Commission of New York City.

In 2009, The Public began its &quot;Going Public&quot; campaign to raise funds for a major renovation of the historic building. Groundbreaking for the $35 million renovation occurred on March 9, 2010, with notables such as Liev Schreiber and Philip Seymour Hoffman in attendance. Plans included a renovation of Joe&#x27;s Pub; the Pub went on a three-month hiatus during the summer of 2011 to allow for construction. The building re-opened on October 4, 2012, after a renovation designed by Ennead Architects costing $40 million.

==Public Works productions==
In 2013, The Public launched Public Works, which brings together diverse groups of people throughout the five boroughs of New York City to watch theater, participate in theatrical workshops, and perform in one full-scale Public Works production alongside professional actors at Shakespeare in the Park. Past Public Works productions include &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Two productions, Shaina Taub&#x27;s adaptations of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;, were later remounted as full Shakespeare in the Park productions in 2018 and 2022, respectively.

<text>In economics, crowding out is a phenomenon that occurs when increased government involvement in a sector of the market economy substantially affects the remainder of the market, either on the supply or demand side of the market.

One type frequently discussed is when expansionary fiscal policy reduces investment spending by the private sector. The government spending is &quot;crowding out&quot; investment because it is demanding more loanable funds and thus causing increased interest rates and therefore reducing investment spending. This basic analysis has been broadened to multiple channels that might leave total output little changed or even smaller.

Other economists use &quot;crowding out&quot; to refer to government providing a service or good that would otherwise be a business opportunity for private industry, and be subject only to the economic forces seen in voluntary exchange.

Behavioral economists and other social scientists also use &quot;crowding out&quot; to describe a downside of solutions based on private exchange: the crowding out of intrinsic motivation and prosocial norms in response to the financial incentives of voluntary market exchange.

==History==
The idea of the crowding out effect, though not the term itself, has been discussed since at least the 18th century. Economic historian Jim Tomlinson wrote in 2010: &quot;All major economic crises in twentieth century Britain have reignited simmering debates about the impact of public sector expansion on economic performance. From the &#x27;Geddes Axe&#x27; after the First World War, through John Maynard Keynes&#x27; attack on the &#x27;Treasury view&#x27; in the interwar years, down to the &#x27;monetarist&#x27; assaults on the public sector of the 1970s and 1980s, it has been alleged that public sector growth in itself, but especially if funded by state borrowing, has detrimental effects on the national economy.&quot; Much of the debate in the 1970s was based on the assumption of a fixed supply of savings within a single country, but with the global capital markets of the 21st century &quot;...international capital mobility completely undermines a simple model of crowding out&quot;.

== Crowding out from government borrowing ==
One channel of crowding out is a reduction in private investment and accumulation of real resources that occurs because of an increase in government spending. Increased government spending results in a shift in the distribution of real resources produced within an economy, away from private use and to public use. This &quot;crowding out&quot; of real investment of capital stock and other resources reduces what is available to the private sector. However, this is assuming that the resource acquisition for the public purpose is non-productive in the long run. There is some controversy in modern macroeconomics on the subject, as different schools of economic thought differ on how households and financial markets would react to more government borrowing under various circumstances.

The extent to which resource crowding out occurs depends on the economic situation. If the economy is at capacity or full employment, then the government suddenly increasing its budget deficit (e.g., via stimulus programs) could create competition with the private sector for scarce resources, resulting in a redistribution of production across the economy. Thus the effect of the stimulus is offset by the effect of crowding out. On the other hand, if the economy is below capacity and there is a surplus of resources available, an increase in the government&#x27;s deficit does not result in competition with the private sector. In this scenario, the stimulus program would be much more effective. In summary, changing the government&#x27;s budget deficit has a stronger impact on GDP when the economy is below capacity. In the aftermath of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the U.S. economy remained well below capacity and there was a large headroom of potential production available should investment be made, so increasing the budget deficit put funds to use that would otherwise have been idle.

===What factors determine how much crowding out takes place?===
The extent to which interest rate adjustments dampen the output expansion induced by increased government spending is determined by:
*Income increases more than interest rates increase if the LM (Liquidity preference—Money supply) curve is flatter.
*Income increases less than interest rates increase if the IS (Investment—Saving) curve is flatter.
*Income and interest rates increase more the larger the multiplier, thus, the larger the horizontal shift in the IS curve.

In each case, the extent of crowding out is greater the more interest rate increases when government spending rises.

Economist Laura D&#x27;Andrea Tyson wrote in June 2012: &quot;By itself an increase in the deficit, either in the form of an increase in government spending or a reduction in taxes, causes an increase in demand. But how this affects output, employment and growth depends on what happens to interest rates. When the economy is operating near capacity, government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit causes interest rates to fall in the first instance since higher net spending from the government injects liquidity into the banking system, pushing down the overnight rate. A response from the Central Bank to increase interest rates may occur if they believe the increased government spending at full resource employment would be inflationary. Higher interest rates reduce private investment, and this reduces growth. The resource “crowding out” argument purports to explain why large and sustained government deficits can take a toll on growth; they reduce capital formation in the private sector. But this argument rests on how government deficits are used. Increased net spending on highly productive state investment in physical and human infrastructure will likely increase long-run growth due to an expansion in the productive potential of the population. When there is considerable excess capacity within the economy, an increase in government deficit does not crowd out private real capital formation. Instead, the higher demand resulting from the increase in the deficit bolsters employment and output directly, and the resulting increase in income and economic activity in turn encourages or &#x27;crowds in&#x27; additional private spending. The crowding-in argument is the right one for current economic conditions.&quot;

===Two extreme cases===
====Liquidity trap====
If the economy is in a hypothesized liquidity trap, the &quot;Liquidity-Money&quot; (LM) curve is horizontal, an increase in government spending has its full multiplier effect on the equilibrium income. There is no change in the interest associated with the change in government spending, thus no investment spending cut off. Therefore, there is no dampening of the effects of increased government spending on income. 
If the demand for money is very sensitive to interest rates, so that the LM curve is almost horizontal, fiscal policy changes have a relatively large effect on output, while monetary policy changes have little effect on the equilibrium output. So, if the LM curve is horizontal, monetary policy has no impact on the equilibrium of the economy and the fiscal policy has a maximal effect.

====The classical case and crowding out====
If the LM curve is vertical, then an increase in government spending has no effect on the equilibrium income and only increases the interest rates. If the demand for money is not related to the interest rate, as the vertical LM curve implies, then there is a unique level of income at which the money market is in equilibrium.

Thus, with a vertical LM curve, an increase in government spending cannot change the equilibrium income and only raises the equilibrium interest rates. But if government spending is higher and the output is unchanged, there must be an offsetting reduction in private spending. In this case, the increase in interest rates crowds out an amount of private spending equal to increase in government spending. Thus, there is full crowding out if LM is vertical.

==Crowding out sources==
If increased government net spending with a corresponding increased issuance of government bonds leads to the Central Bank increasing interest rates, and hence a higher &quot;price&quot; (&quot;ceteris paribus&quot;), the private sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, will likely reduce investment due to a lower rate of return. This is the investment that is crowded out. The weakening of fixed investment and other interest-sensitive expenditure counteracts to varying extents the expansionary effect of government deficits. More importantly, a fall in fixed investment by business can hurt long-term economic growth of the supply side, i.e., the growth of potential output.
Thus, the situation in which a tight monetary policy may lead to crowding out is that companies would like to expand productive capacity, but, because of high interest rates, cannot borrow funds with which to do so. According to American economist Jared Bernstein, writing in 2011, this scenario is &quot;not a plausible story with excess capacity, the Fed funds [interest] rate at zero, and companies sitting on cash that they could invest with if they saw good reasons to do so.&quot; Another American economist, Paul Krugman, pointed out that, after the beginning of the recession in 2008, the federal government&#x27;s borrowing increased by hundreds of billions of dollars, leading to warnings about crowding out, but instead interest rates had actually fallen. When aggregate demand is low, government spending tends to expand the market for private-sector products through the fiscal multiplier and thus stimulates – or &quot;crowds in&quot; – fixed investment (via the &quot;accelerator effect&quot;). This accelerator effect is most important when business suffers from unused industrial capacity, i.e., during a serious recession or a depression.

Chartalist and Post-Keynesian economists question the crowding out of nominal funds thesis because government spending has the actual effect of lowering short-term interest rates by injecting liquidity into the banking system in the first instance, not raising them. However, the rate for short-term debt is always set by intervention by central banks - they pay interest on reserve balances to set a floor on inter-bank lending rates and therefore bank-customer lending rates. Additionally, private credit is not constrained by any &quot;amount of funds&quot; or &quot;money supply&quot; or similar concept. Rather, banks lend to any credit-worthy customer, constrained by their capitalization level and risk regulations. The resulting loan creates a deposit simultaneously, increasing the amount of endogenous money at that time.
Crowding out is most plausibly effective when an economy is already at potential output or full employment. Then the government&#x27;s expansionary fiscal policy encourages increased prices, which lead to an increased demand for money. This in turn leads to higher interest rates if the Central Bank decides to increase them and crowds out interest-sensitive spending. At potential output, businesses are in no need of markets, so that there is no room for an accelerator effect. More directly, if the economy stays at full employment gross domestic product, any increase in government purchases shifts resources away from the private sector. This phenomenon is sometimes called &quot;real&quot; crowding out and is the only pertinent crowding out that occurs with increased government spending.

Crowding out of another sort (often referred to as international crowding out) may occur due to the prevalence of floating exchange rates, as demonstrated by the Mundell–Fleming model. Government borrowing can lead to higher interest rates if the Central Bank raises them, which attract inflows of money on the capital account from foreign financial markets into the domestic currency (i.e., into assets denominated in that currency). Under floating exchange rates, that leads to appreciation of the exchange rate and thus the &quot;crowding out&quot; of domestic exports (which become more expensive to those using foreign currency). However, an appreciating domestic currency increases domestic demand for imports thereby &quot;crowding in&quot; the import of real production produced abroad. These effects on net exports have ambiguous impacts on the demand-promoting effects of government deficits but have no obvious negative effect on long-term economic growth.

==Crowding out demand==
In terms of health economics, &quot;crowding-out&quot; refers to the phenomenon whereby new or expanded programs meant to cover the uninsured have the effect of prompting those already enrolled in private insurance to switch to the new program. This effect was seen, for example, in expansions to Medicaid and the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in the late 1990s.

Therefore, high takeup rates for new or expanded programs do not merely represent the previously uninsured, but also represent those who may have been forced to shift their health insurance from the private to the public sector. As a result of these shifts, it can be projected that healthcare improvements as a result of policy change may not be as robust. In the context of the CHIP debate, this assumption was challenged by projections produced by the Congressional Budget Office, which &quot;scored&quot; all versions of the CHIP reauthorization and included in those scores the best assumptions available regarding the impacts of increased funding for these programs. CBO assumed that many already eligible children would become enrolled as a result of the new funding and policies in CHIP reauthorization, but that some would be eligible for private insurance. The vast majority, even in states with enrollments of those above twice the poverty line (around $40,000 for a family of four), did not have access to age-appropriate health insurance for their children. New Jersey, supposedly the model for profligacy in SCHIP with eligibility that stretched to 350% of the federal poverty level, testified that it could identify 14% crowd-out in its CHIP program.

In the context of CHIP and Medicaid, many children are eligible but not enrolled. Thus, in comparison to Medicare, which allows for near &quot;auto-enrollment&quot; for those over 64, children&#x27;s caregivers may be required to fill out 17-page forms, produce multiple consecutive pay stubs, re-apply at more than yearly intervals and even conduct face-to-face interviews to prove the eligibility of the child. These anti-crowd-out procedures can fracture care for children, sever the connection to their medical home and lead to worse health outcomes.

==Crowding out supply==
Crowding out is also said to occur in charitable giving when government public policy inserts itself into roles that had traditionally been private voluntary charity, rendering private charity unnecessary. Crowding out has also been observed in the area of venture capital, suggesting that government involvement in financing commercial enterprises crowds out private finance.

<text>Heinrich Friedrich Ludwig Rellstab (13 April 179927 November 1860) was a German poet and music critic. He was born and died in Berlin. He was the son of the music publisher and composer Johann Carl Friedrich Rellstab. An able pianist, he published articles in various periodicals, including the influential liberal &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot;, and launched the music journal &quot;Iris im Gebiete der Tonkunst&quot;, which was published in Berlin from 1830 to 1841. His outspoken criticism of the influence in Berlin of Gaspare Spontini landed him in jail in 1837.

Rellstab was, according to Max Graf, &quot;the first great music critic&quot;. His considerable influence gave him some power over what music could be used for German nationalistic purposes in the mid-nineteenth century. Because he had &quot;an effective monopoly on music criticism&quot; in Frankfurt and due to the popularity of his writings, Rellstab&#x27;s approval would have been important for any musician&#x27;s career in areas in which German nationalism was present.

The first seven songs of Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Schwanengesang&quot; have words by Rellstab, who had left them in 1825 with Beethoven, whose assistant Anton Schindler passed them on to Schubert. His work was also set to music by Franz Liszt.

He is also known to have given Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27/2, its famous nickname &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;.

Concerning Chopin&#x27;s nocturnes, in contrast with those of John Field:

“Where [John] Field smiles, Chopin makes a grinning grimace; where Field sighs, Chopin groans; where Field shrugs his shoulders, Chopin arches his back like a cat, where Field puts some seasoning into the food, Chopin empties a handful of cayenne pepper… In short, if one holds Field’s charming romances before a distorting, concave mirror, so that every delicate impression becomes a coarse one, one gets Chopin’s work. We implore Mr Chopin to return to nature.” - Ludwig Rellstab after 1832 when Chopin&#x27;s first Nocturne was published.

<text>Blindern is the main campus of the University of Oslo, located in Nordre Aker in Oslo, Norway.

==Campus==
Most of the departments of the University of Oslo are located at Blindern; other, smaller campuses include Sentrum (law), Gaustad (medicine), St. Hanshaugen (odontology) and Tøyen (botany, zoology, geology and paleontology).

The central building is the new university library, Georg Sverdrup&#x27;s house. Other buildings of note are Eilert Sundt&#x27;s house, the social studies building; the humanities buildings, named after Sophus Bugge, Henrik Wergeland, Niels Treschow and P. A. Munch; Frederikke, the welfare building; and Niels Henrik Abel&#x27;s house, for mathematical studies, the biology building, named after Kristine Bonnevie, the first female professor at Oslo University.

Though the construction of a university campus at Blindern was decided on as early as 1921, the first buildings were not ready for use before 1931. Only in 1960 was Upper Blindern, the area most associate with the university today, finished. UiO today has approximately 32,000 students.
==Etymology==
The campus is named after the old farm Blindern from Norse &quot;Blindarvin&quot;. The first element is probably the genitive of an old name of the brook, Blindernbekken (&quot;Blind&quot;), the last element is &quot;vin&quot; f &#x27;meadow&#x27;. The word &quot;Blind&quot; is derived from the fact that parts of the brook were hidden to see since the brook had a deep course.

==History==
Blindern was ancient farmland. In the 18th and 19th century the owners were among the progressive farmers who employed modern methods of agriculture, sold refrigerated milk to the city. Halvor Blinderen (1733–1804) was a pioneering farm owner and was among the first farmer to grow potatoes in Norway.

In the 1850s parts of the Blindern farm were made the vicarage of Vestre Aker parish. Among the parsons was poet and folklorist Jørgen Moe, who is buried at the churchyard (&quot;Vestre Aker kirkegård&quot;).

<text>Pastorita Huaracina (December 19, 1930 - May 2001) born María Alvarado Trujillo, was a Peruvian singer who strongly identified with the traditions of the rural Andes. Her career began in the era of 78 rpm records and lasted into that of compact discs. In the 1950s she recorded 4 songs a month and sold more records in Peru than the Beatles. Her success established her reputation as the diva of Andean song and she won every award that pertained to her type of music. She toured extensively in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

==Biography==

Pastorita Huaracina was born in the Malvas district of Aija Province, Ancash region. Reportedly, even as a young child tending the flocks, she already loved to sing. Raised speaking Quechua, upon the death of her mother she traveled to Lima at the age of 8, with no luggage or money and no one to meet her, and speaking very little Spanish.

She debuted as a performer on her 12th birthday. She began as a performer of Andean dances but later became a singer and composer of songs. She developed a reputation as disciplined trouper, always the first to arrive at a rehearsal or performance; this continued even once she became a star. She always advocated for authenticity in the performance of Andean music and dance, including the use of traditional outfits: &quot;typical dress is not a costume, it is part of our identity, something we must assume with honor and pride, being conscious of whom we represent...&quot;

Her singing became a symbol of liberty and of a demand for the rights of the &quot;serranos&quot;, the people of the high Andes, expressing beauty but also bearing the people&#x27;s demand for opportunity and conditions for their development. On her program on Radio Santa Rosa, &quot;Canta el Perú Profundo&quot; she openly expressed her opposition to the dictatorship of Alberto Fujimori and Vladimiro Montesinos, and she was a longtime defender of the validity of the Quechua language. Loyal to her principles, she refused significant sums of money from politicians who solicited her for their electoral campaigns and from businesses which she felt unfairly exploited the people. Towards the end of her life, only one week after an operation and in delicate health, she voted in the Peruvian presidential election of 2001. She died of cancer in 2001

<doc id="1218964" wikidata="Q4993815" url="?curid=1218964" title="William Farrar Smith">
<text>William Farrar Smith (February 17, 1824February 28, 1903), known as &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, was a Union general in the American Civil War, notable for attracting the extremes of glory and blame. He was praised for his gallantry in the Seven Days Battles and the Battle of Antietam, but was demoted for professional and political reasons after the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg. As chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland, he achieved recognition by restoring a supply line that saved that army from starvation and surrender, known as the &quot;Cracker Line&quot;, that helped Union troops to success in the Chattanooga Campaign in the autumn of 1863. Leading the first operation against Petersburg, Smith&#x27;s caution, possibly illness-related, may have cost the Union a prime opportunity for a quick end to the war. He was relieved of command shortly thereafter.

==Early life==
Smith, known to his friends as &quot;Baldy&quot;, was born at St. Albans, Vermont, the son of Ashbel and Sarah Butler Smith, and a cousin of J. Gregory Smith (governor of Vermont, 1863–1865). He was educated locally in Vermont until he attended the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1841, and graduated four years later standing fourth of 41 cadets. Smith was appointed a brevet second lieutenant on July 1, 1845, and was assigned to the Topographical Engineers Corps. He was promoted to second lieutenant on July 14, 1849, and promoted to first lieutenant on March 3, 1853.

During his service in the Corps, Smith conducted surveys of the Great Lakes, the states of Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as well as much of Mexico. While serving in Florida, Smith was stricken with the infectious disease malaria. Although he would recover at the time, the illness affected his physical health for the rest of his life. In 1856 Smith began his involvement in the lighthouse service, which was headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, and eventually rose to become the Engineer Secretary of the Lighthouse Board.

Smith was also twice assistant professor of mathematics at West Point (1846–48 and 1855–56). He was promoted to captain on July 1, 1859.

==Civil War==
Smith was commissioned the colonel of the Third Vermont on July 23, 1861, but dated from April 27, making him the ranking officer of Vermont troops. On August 13, 1861, he was appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army after helping organize the 1st Vermont Brigade. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his gallantry at the Battle of White Oak Swamp in the Seven Days Battles. On July 4, 1862, he received promotion to the rank of major general in the Union Army. Smith led his division with conspicuous valor during the Battle of Antietam, and was again brevetted in the regular army. When his corps commander, Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, was reassigned to a superior command, Smith was placed at the head of the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac, which he led at the disastrous Battle of Fredericksburg.

The recriminations that followed Fredericksburg led to a famous general order in which army commander Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside proposed to dismiss several of the senior officers of the army. President Abraham Lincoln prevented this order from taking effect and relieved Burnside of his command instead. Smith was one of the affected officers, but it is to his credit that he did not leave the Army. However, his indiscretion in communicating to Lincoln directly about Burnside&#x27;s shortcomings, compounded by the fact that Smith was a close friend of out-of-favor Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, resulted in his losing both his corps command and his rank; the Senate failed to confirm his nomination to major general, which expired on March 4, 1863. Reverting to the rank of brigadier general, he commanded a division-sized force of militia within the Department of the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania during the critical days of the Gettysburg Campaign, repelling Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart at a skirmish in Carlisle. Smith&#x27;s green troops then participated in the unsuccessful pursuit of Gen. Robert E. Lee back to the Potomac River. He followed this in division command in West Virginia.

On October 3, 1863, Smith was assigned to duty as chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland (and a couple of weeks later, the Military Division of the Mississippi). As such he conducted the engineer operations and launched the Battle of Brown&#x27;s Ferry, which opened the &quot;Cracker Line&quot; to provide supplies and reinforcements to the besieged troops in Chattanooga. Of this action the House Committee on Military Affairs reported in 1865 that &quot;as a subordinate, General WF Smith had saved the Army of the Cumberland from capture, and afterwards directed it to victory.&quot; Smith was then renominated for the rank of major general of volunteers. Ulysses S. Grant, who was much impressed with Smith&#x27;s work, insisted strongly that the nomination should be confirmed, which was accordingly done by the Senate on March 9, 1864. Grant, according to his own statement &quot;was not long in finding out that the objections to Smith&#x27;s promotion were well grounded,&quot; but he never said what the grounds were, while Smith, contributing to a major series of war memoirs, maintained that they were purely of a personal character.

For the Overland Campaign of 1864, Smith was assigned by Grant to command the XVIII Corps in Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler&#x27;s Army of the James, which he led in the Battle of Cold Harbor and the first operations against Petersburg. Smith&#x27;s corps and a division of black troops (under Edward W. Hinks) were ordered to take the city. Remembering the debacle at Cold Harbor, Smith performed exhaustive reconnaissance. Determining that the section of the defensive line was manned primarily by artillery, he ordered an attack. The attack was successful in capturing several Confederate batteries and over a mile of entrenchments. However, by the time this was accomplished, Smith determined that darkness prevented him from effectively moving further. Both the time it took to prepare for the attack and suspending the attack at night has led some historians to see the outcome of the battle as a missed opportunity to shorten the war by nearly a year. But the fault may also lay with General Grant who failed to communicate with Smith, Major General George Gordon Meade and Major General Winfield Scott Hancock the full picture of the battle&#x27;s true objective and provide the time to develop an effective operational plan. Smith&#x27;s personal and professional differences with Generals Butler and Meade led General Grant to relieve Smith from command of the XVIII Corps on July 19, 1864. Smith spent the remainder of the war serving on military commissions, including one that discovered significant corruption in the Department of the Gulf.

==Postbellum career==
Smith resigned from the volunteer service in 1865, and from the U.S. Army in 1867. From 1864 to 1873 he was president of the International Telegraph Company, and from 1875 to 1881 served on the board of police commissioners of New York City, becoming its president in 1877. After 1881 he was engaged in civil engineering work in Pennsylvania. He died at Philadelphia in 1903 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His &quot;Autobiography of Major General William F. Smith, 1861–1864&quot; was published posthumously in 1990.

<text>Elseus Sophus Bugge (5 January 1833 – 8 July 1907) was a Norwegian philologist and linguist. His scholarly work was directed to the study of runic inscriptions and Norse philology. Bugge is best known for his theories and his work on the runic alphabet and the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Prose Edda&quot;.

==Background==
Bugge was born in Larvik, in Vestfold county, Norway. His ancestors had been merchants, ship owners and captains of the Larvik for several generations. Bugge was a Candidatus magisterii (1857) and research fellow in comparative linguistics and Sanskrit (1860). He was educated in Christiania, Copenhagen and Berlin.

==Career==
In 1866, he became professor of comparative philology, comparative Indo-European linguistics and Old Norse at Christiania University now the University of Oslo. In addition to collecting Norwegian folksongs and traditions and writing on Runic inscriptions, he made considerable contributions to the study of the Celtic, Romance, Oscan, Umbrian and Etruscan languages. His scientific work was of fundamental importance for the Norse philology and runic research.

In his 1881 work, &quot;Studier over de nordiske Gude- og Heltesagns Oprindelse&quot; (Studies on the Origin of the Nordic Legends of Gods and Heroes), Bugge theorized that nearly all myths in Old Norse literature derive from Christian and late classical concepts. Bugge&#x27;s theories were generally vehemently rejected, but have had some influence.

Bugge was the author of a very large number of books on philology and folklore. His principal work, a critical edition of the Poetic Edda (&quot;Norrœn Fornkvæði&quot;), was published at Christiania in 1867. He maintained that the Eddic poems and the earlier sagas were largely founded on Christian and Latin tradition imported into Scandinavian literature by way of England. His writings also include &quot;Gamle Norske Folkeviser&quot; (1858), a collection of Old Norse folk-songs; &quot;Bidrag til den ældste skaldedigtnings historie&quot; (Christiania, 1894); &quot;Helge-digtene i den Ældre Edda&quot; (Copenhagen, 1896, Eng. trans., &quot;The Home of the Eddic Poems&quot;, 1899); &quot;Norsk Sagafortælling og Sagaskrivning i Island&quot; (Christiania, 1901), and various books on runic inscriptions.

By 1902, Bugge&#x27;s vision had become so poor that he could no longer read. Professor and linguist Magnus Olsen, who was Bugge&#x27;s assistant and successor, read and described new discoveries of inscriptions. Bugge&#x27;s final works regarding original rune scripture were not completed before he died. They were released between 1910 and 1913 through the efforts of Professor Olsen.

==Honors==
Bugge was a member of the Scientific Society of Christiania (now The Norwegian Academy of Science) from 1858 (vice president 1884), The Royal Norwegian Scientific Society in Trondheim (1865) and a number of foreign societies. He was made honorary doctor at Uppsala University in 1877. He was appointed a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1877, Commander Grand Cross 1890 and 1896.

==Personal life==
Bugge was married during 1869 to Karen Sophie Schreiner (1835–1897). His son, Alexander, became a noted historian.

<text>Lance Corporal John Joseph Caffrey VC (23 October 1891 – 22 February 1953), was a British Army soldier and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that is awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Caffrey left Ireland at an early age and settled in Nottingham (a city in Nottinghamshire, England), joining the British Army in 1910.

==Military service==
Caffrey was 24 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, of the British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 November 1915 near La Brique, France, a man was badly wounded and lying in the open unable to move, in full view of and about from the enemy&#x27;s trenches. A corporal of the RAMC and Private Caffrey at once tried to rescue him, but at the first attempt were driven back by shrapnel from enemy fire. They tried again and succeeded in reaching and bandaging the wounded man. However, just as they were lifting him up, the RAMC corporal was shot in the head. Private Caffrey bandaged the corporal and helped him back to safety, and then returned and brought in the other wounded man.

Caffrey later achieved the rank of Sergeant and served in the Home Guard during World War II. He was employed in civilian life as a commissionaire.
He died in Derby, England on 22 February 1953.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The York and Lancaster Regiment Museum within the Clifton Park Museum in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England.

<text>Schwelm is a town in the district of Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis in the administrative region of Arnsberg within the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

==Geography==
Schwelm is situated in the southeast of the &quot;&quot;Ruhrgebiet&quot;, the Ruhr district of Germany, between Westphalia and the &quot;Bergisches Land&quot;. Schwelm is commonly known as the &quot;Pforte Westfalens&quot;&quot; (&quot;Gate to Westphalia&quot;).

===Neighbouring places===
Surrounding towns include Ennepetal, Gevelsberg, Sprockhövel and Wuppertal.

===Division of the town===
Schwelm is called the &quot;town of neighbourhoods&quot;. It is made up of the following 13 neighbourhoods:

* Aechte de Muer
* Brunnen
* Fronhof
* Linderhausen
* Loh
* Möllenkotten
* Oberstadt
* Oehde
* Ossenkamp
* Parliament
* Rote Wasser
* Winterberg
* Zur alten Post
==History==
The history of Schwelm can be traced back to the ninth century, where it is first mentioned as &quot;Suelmiu&quot;. The town of Schwelm was officially established in 1496 and became seat of the Ennepe-Ruhr district in 1929. According to its area, Schwelm is the smallest town in North Rhine-Westphalia.

==Language/dialect==
A Westphalian variety of high German is spoken in Schwelm (Westphalian: from old Saxon &quot;Westfal&quot; = &quot;western land&quot;). The Westphalian dialect belongs to the low Saxon dialects, which is a part of the family of low German dialects. Compared to other German regions (e.g., Bavaria or Swabia) the dialect does not have a strong influence on the everyday speech. Especially the elderly population is still able to speak Schwelm&#x27;s original Westphalian tongue, called &quot;Schwelmer Platt&quot;, which is quite different from standard high German and bears a certain resemblance to Dutch.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Schwelm is Stephan Langhard of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2020. In the most recent mayoral election on 13 and 27 September 2020, Langhard advanced to the runoff with 41.85% of votes against Philipp Beckmann of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), who won 30.4%. Heinz-Jürgen Lenz, with the endorsement of the CDU and The Greens, placed third with 27.8%. In the runoff, Langhard won with 52.4% of votes.

=== Local council ===

The Schwelm city council governs the city alongside the Mayor. The most recent city council election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

==Points of interest==
Schwelm has got a historical town center with many old houses, some of which date back to the 18th century. The &quot;Altmarkt&quot; is a historical market place lying in front of the tall &quot;Christuskirche&quot;, the town&#x27;s principal Protestant church. From the &quot;Altmarkt&quot;, the decorative street &quot;Kölner Strasse&quot; leads uphill and is part of the former road to Cologne.

Until 2011, Schwelm was home to the &quot;Brauerei Schwelm&quot;, the &quot;Schwelm Brewery&quot;, one of few remaining private breweries in North Rhine-Westphalia. Established in 1830 by Haarmann &amp; Kathagen, the brewery was one of the first worldwide to switch from wooden to metal storage containers. The original administration building, the &quot;Rietz&#x27;sche Haus&quot; built in 1701, is an appealing house in the town center. Most of the brewery&#x27;s historic production site, however, was torn down in 2012.

The oldest piano manufacturer in the world is located in Schwelm. Since 1794, &quot;Rud. Ibach Sohn&quot; has been building pianos and, until 1904, organs in Schwelm.

Europe&#x27;s biggest fair-trade organisation &quot;GEPA&quot; was founded in Schwelm in the 1970s, but is now located in Wuppertal.

A historical Jewish cemetery, dating from the late 18th century is located in the countryside about 1.3 km south of the town&#x27;s center. It is maintained by the municipality and volunteers.

<doc id="1218987" wikidata="Q372187" url="?curid=1218987" title="Arthur Numan">
<text>Arthur Numan (born 14 December 1969) is a Dutch former professional footballer. He played as a left back and was a regular fixture in Netherlands national football team. He is currently the team manager for the Netherlands B squad and a scout for AZ Alkmaar.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Heemskerk, North Holland, Numan started his career with the amateur club SV Beverwijk and was spotted by Haarlem, who handed him his first professional game against DS &#x27;79 on 26 March 1988 which his team won 2–0. He originally played in a more attacking role, but his long-time mentor Dick Advocaat, then the coach of Haarlem, positioned him as a left fullback.

===Twente and PSV===
Numan joined Twente at the close of the 1990–91 season where he scored goals even as a defender. He was named team captain for the Enschede team and also captained the Dutch Under 21 national team. However, it was not until he joined PSV Eindhoven that his talents were fully appreciated. He was drafted into the Dutch team for a World Cup qualifying game against Poland which ended in a 2–2 draw on 14 October 1992. Numan was substituted after forty minutes by Advocaat, who was then the national team coach and brought on PSV teammate Gerald Vanenburg as his team was 2–0 down early in the game.

===Rangers===
A £4.5 million deal took him to Rangers in May 1998, but Numan&#x27;s time in Scotland was then blighted by injuries that forced him to sit out many games. Dick Advocaat, who managed the team at that time, waited for Numan to recover, a move which was rewarded when he helped the team to considerable league success as well as the treble in his first and final season at Rangers. Numan was awarded the teams vice-captaincy serving as deputy to captain Lorenzo Amoruso. He had a particularly prolific relationship with German international left sided midfielder Jorg Albertz. However, at the end of the 2002–03 season, he and the club could not agree a new contract so he left at the end of that season. He stated that he was willing to accept a pay-cut offer but felt that his club wanted too large a drop in wages. He soon announced his retirement. A late offer by Villarreal failed to change his mind and he refused to continue his career in Holland. He was not looking forward to start afresh training and playing hectic games every week.

==International career==
Numan was included in the squad for the 1994 World Cup in the United States, although he was never included in the starting line-up for any of the matches. His World Cup debut came against Ireland as a substitute in the 75th minute. He was also selected for Euro 1996, yet also failed to start a match at the tournament.

Numan was chosen to captain the team. He featured in most of the qualification games for the 1998 World Cup. Numan played in all of the group matches in France, although the quarter final game against Argentina was marred with his second yellow card of the game (after a tackle on Diego Simeone). He missed the crucial clash with eventual finalist Brazil. He played in the third placing match against Croatia, but could not help his team win the bronze medal.

Numan continued to feature in the Dutch national team, representing his country on home soil during the Euro 2000 tournament. By 2000, Numan&#x27;s career at the international stage appeared to wane and his automatic left back spot was open to his contenders Winston Bogarde and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. He was to play for the remaining games of his team&#x27;s failed attempt to capture their first major trophy since 1988 culminating in the semi-final loss to Italy on penalties.

He was determined to assist his national team to qualify for the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan under manager Louis van Gaal but the crucial game against Ireland at Landsdowne Road stadium in late 2001 was lost 1–0. He retired from international football after his final international game against United States on 19 May 2002, which the Dutch won 2–0 away.

==Managing career==
Numan was a regular pundit on Scotsport SPL, Scottish and Grampian TV&#x27;s round-up of Scottish Premier League action and remained in Hamilton for a few years after his retirement. He was also appointed treasurer of the Rangers Charity Trust.

He has taken up the position of team manager for the Netherlands B squad in December 2008.

Numan signed a one-year contract with Aston Villa to become their scout in the Netherlands and surrounding areas in mid-2011.

Currently, he works as a scout for Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar on a part-time basis.

<doc id="1218995" wikidata="Q7994034" url="?curid=1218995" title="Whistle-stop train tour">
<text>A whistle stop or whistle-stop tour is a style of political campaigning where the politician makes a series of brief appearances or speeches at a number of small towns over a short period of time. Originally, whistle-stop appearances were made from the open platform of an observation car or a private railroad car.

==Definition and usage==
The definition of the term derives from the practice of a small, occasionally used railway station signaling a train so the engineer will know to stop. Trains inbound to a &quot;whistle stop&quot; station would signal their approach with a blast of the train&#x27;s steam whistle which would alert the train depot attendant to their arrival. If passengers, mail, or freight waited to be picked up at the depot, the depot master would raise a tower signal to indicate to the train engineer that the train should stop. If no stop was necessary, a different signal would be raised and the engineer could pass through the depot without stopping.

One usage of the term in the political context, by Robert A. Taft, was derisive. He accused then-President Harry S. Truman of &quot; Congress at whistle stops across the country&quot;.

==Background==

In the 19th century, when travel by railroad was the most common means of transport, politicians would charter tour trains which would travel from town to town. At each stop, the candidate would make a speech from the train, but might rarely set foot on the ground. &quot;Whistle stop&quot; campaign speeches would be made from the rear platform of a train.

One of the most famous railroad cars to be used in the U.S. whistle-stop tours was the &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot;, the only car custom built for the President of the United States in the 20th century. Originally built in 1928 by the Pullman Company and officially the &quot;U.S. No. 1 Presidential Railcar&quot;, the &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot; is on display at the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in Miami, Florida. The famous news photo of Harry S Truman holding up a copy of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; with a banner headline stating &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman&quot; was taken on this platform on Wednesday, 3 November 1948, at St. Louis Union Station. The &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot; was also used by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and, to a much lesser extent, by President Dwight Eisenhower. The &quot;Magellan&quot;&#x27;s last official trip before retirement was in 1954, when first lady Mamie Eisenhower rode it from Washington, D.C., to Groton, Connecticut, to christen the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine, the . President Ronald Reagan used the &quot;Magellan&quot; for one day, 12 October 1984, traveling 120 miles in Ohio, from Dayton to Perrysburg, making five stops to give &quot;whistle stop&quot; speeches along the way.

==Modern whistle-stop tours==
Charles III of the United Kingdom started a five-day whistle-stop tour of the United Kingdom on Monday, 6 September 2010, with a speech in Glasgow when he was Prince of Wales. The green campaigning tour was a part of the Prince&#x27;s Start initiative that aimed to build public awareness of sustainable activities.

In Europe, touring politicians still occasionally take a train, as the excellent, dense railway network offers access comparable to road travel and as it is better suited for extensive trips than air travel. In 2009, for example, German chancellor (and CDU candidate) Angela Merkel made a highly publicized tour in Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s old campaign train. The SPD, on the other hand, discontinued the use of train tours for campaigns before the 1998 election.

On 30 September 2020, after the first presidential debate against Donald Trump, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden rode on an Amtrak &quot;Build Back Better Express&quot; from Cleveland, Ohio, to Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

<text>The Battle of Emmaus took place around September 165 BC during the Maccabean Revolt between Judean rebels, led by Judas Maccabeus (Judah Maccabee), and an expedition of Seleucid Empire forces under generals Gorgias, Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor near Emmaus. The battle was won by the Maccabee rebels, who marched by night and surprised the Seleucid camp while many soldiers were absent. The victorious Maccabees looted the Greek camp for valuables and likely weapons to help further their cause.

== Primary sources ==
The Battle of Emmaus is recorded in the books of 1 Maccabees (), 2 Maccabees (), and Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; Book 12. In general, the account in 1 Maccabees gives a more detailed description of the battle and the rebel army, and the author was possibly even a personal eyewitness to the battle. The description in 2 Maccabees gives a more accurate depiction of the Seleucid forces and commanders, but its depiction of the battle is more focused on moral lessons and emphasizing the righteousness of Judas and the Maccabee cause.

==Background==
Toward the end of the summer of 165 BC, King Antiochus IV Epiphanes gathered forces from the Western part of his empire to leave for an expedition to the eastern satrapies in Babylonia and Persia. There, he intended to stay awhile, replace or do battle with rebellious governors, deter the growing Parthian Empire from invading, and restore a flow of taxes to the capital. He left Lysias in charge as regent in the Seleucid capital Antioch and to raise his young son, the future Antiochus V. 

At the time, Jerusalem was still ruled by Seleucid-friendly Hellenist Jews and High Priest Menelaus. Perhaps at the request of Menelaus, Lysias dispatched a force, led by Ptolemy son of Dorymenes (strategos of Coele Syria and Phoenicia), in order to aid the ruling faction of Hellenist Jews and defeat the countryside rebels led by Judas. Ptolemy was accompanied by Gorgias and Nicanor as commanders. 2 Maccabees also suggests that Nicanor, one of the Seleucid generals, intended to raise money by using the army to enslave Jews, then sell them and pay off a 2,000 talent debt the Seleucids owed to the Roman Republic.

== Battle ==
The Seleucids established their base camp at the town of Emmaus. Emmaus is at the eastern edge of the Ayalon Valley and along the western border of Judea; it is a spot with easy access to numerous routes into the Judean hills and good water, making it an excellent base to project power from. Emmaus itself was largely flat, allowing use of cavalry and denying any rebel advantages from hilly terrain. Judas Maccabeus&#x27;s camp was located in the town of Mizpah, north of Jerusalem. Gorgias planned to attack Judas&#x27;s concentration of troops after receiving word of them; Judas possibly intentionally ensured that word of his location would leak by performing obvious ceremonies and rituals. Judas&#x27;s scouts and spies found out that Gorgias was leading troops on a march against his camp and was planning to surprise the Jewish rebels in a night-time attack. Judas also possibly intentionally trimmed his army during a morale-raising religious ceremony at Mizpah. Using criteria from the Book of Deuteronomy, he ordered some of his troops to decamp: if they were betrothed, for example. Some scholars believe this claim is ahistorical and added to buttress the righteousness of the cause; others think the passage is historical, and suspect Judas intentionally favored the speed of a small force, and used the Biblical criteria on who to exclude as a way to build morale. 2 Maccabees writes that the Jewish force numbered 6,000 total, and 1 Maccabees indicates 3,000 soldiers actually proceeded with the attack.

Judas abandoned the camp at Mizpah and led his forces to Emmaus, to attack the expedition base camp that remained there. The timing on such a maneuver would have been strict: the Maccabees would have required excellent, speedy intelligence such as signal fires or riders and to have left just at nightfall for such a tactic to work, and to have chosen a different road than Gorgias took. Gorgias found the camp at Mizpah empty and deserted, and believing the rebel army had fled, began a search for them in the surrounding area.

The rebel troops, which had in truth advanced forward, came upon the unprepared Seleucid camp at Emmaus at dawn. Judas&#x27;s troops numbered about 3,000 who had gone with him on the night march, and consisted of light infantry armed with swords and shields, perhaps fighting similar to peltasts of the era. The Seleucids had fortified their camp, possibly with a palisade, and had mounted scouts to offer at least some warning of an attack. However, many soldiers were absent with Gorgias, and others still asleep or unready. Blowing trumpets for intimidation and morale, the Jewish rebels attacked and forced the surprised camp to retreat to the southwest, toward Idumea.

Gorgias returned to Emmaus, only to find his camp destroyed. The Maccabees lit fires, possibly to disguise their number and discourage Gorgias&#x27;s force from joining the fight. Gorgias did not give battle after the destruction of his base, but left for the coastal plains. The Maccabees looted the camp, taking gold and silver. While not directly recorded in the primary sources, they also presumably took abandoned Seleucid weapons: the rebels would have wanted better equipment, and the rebels are reported as indeed having better equipment in later battles of the revolt.

The outcome of the battle was quite influential. The two earlier clashes recorded against Apollonius and Seron appear to have been against small detachments. With this victory, the Maccabees proved that they could challenge larger numbers of Seleucid troops, and could make complicated plans and tactical ploys. Many rebellions existed during this time period, but most were quickly put out; the staying power of the Maccabees helped set up the eventual independence of the Hasmonean kingdom.

==Analysis==
1 Maccabees is generally considered trustworthy in its depiction of the battle itself. Scholars have quibbled with other aspects of its portrayal of the battle, however. As in most battles of the Maccabean Revolt, the rebels and authors of 1 and 2 Maccabees are generally considered to have written exaggerated estimates of the size of the Seleucid forces. Defeating larger armies made for more impressive morale-raising stories. The book of 1 Maccabees claims that Gorgias&#x27;s force that split from the camp consisted of 5,000 soldiers, 1,000 cavalrymen, and allied Hellenist Jews from the Acra as guides in his expedition to attack Judas, yet this would be unwieldy for a surprise attack that would travel through the narrow Beth Horon ascent, and the Seleucids had perhaps only 5,000 cavalry in the entire Western half of their empire. Some later manuscripts of 1 Maccabees adds that the rebel troops lacked &quot;helmets and slings and stones and armor&quot; as well in the battle; this is considered likely to be a gloss of an unknown scribe copying the material, and unlikely to be historical. Reported Seleucid casualty numbers are also considered implausibly high: 3,000 defeated according to 1 Maccabees, and 9,000 according to 2 Maccabees.

Judas&#x27;s speeches and prayers in the book of 1 Maccabees are best seen as free compositions of the historian, not actual transcriptions, in the style of Hellenistic historians to essentially invent or rewrite such dialogue to be more literary. At the Battle of Emmaus, Judas&#x27;s speech does not make sense in context: 1 Maccabees has him give the speech just before the rebels attack the base camp. Yet during a surprise attack, time is of the essence; every minute of delay after being spotted gives the defenders more time to rouse themselves, put on armor, and man the palisade. If Judas offered any speeches or special instructions, they would have happened during the ceremony held at Mizpah, a day earlier.

<text>Fort Pitt was a fort built by British forces between 1759 and 1761 during the French and Indian War at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers, where the Ohio River is formed in western Pennsylvania (modern day Pittsburgh). It was near (but not directly on) the site of Fort Duquesne, a French colonial fort built in 1754 as tensions increased between Great Britain and France in both Europe and North America. The French destroyed Fort Duquesne in 1758 when they retreated under British attack.

Virginia colonial protection of this area ultimately led to the development of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania by British-American colonists and immigrants.

==Location and construction==

In April 1754, the French began building Fort Duquesne on the site of the small British Fort Prince George at the beginning of the French and Indian War (AKA Seven Years&#x27; War). The Braddock expedition, a 1755 British attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela at present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania. The French garrison later defeated an attacking British regiment in September 1758 at the Battle of Fort Duquesne. French Colonel de Lignery ordered Fort Duquesne destroyed and abandoned at the approach of General John Forbes&#x27; expedition in late November.

A number of factors contributed to this strategic withdrawal. In August 1758 the French Fort Frontenac, at the head of Lake Ontario, was captured by British Gen. Bradstreet, severing the supply lines to French fortifications across the frontier. Fort Duquesne was the southernmost of these. Short on materiel, French commander François-Marie Le Marchand de Lignery was forced to dismiss elements under his command down the Ohio River to their bases in Illinois and Louisiana, and send others overland north to Ft. Presque Isle. Those Native who may have remained at Fort Duquesne were likely eager to return to their winter longhouses before the weather changed. Consequently, the fort was further undermanned, possibly left with as few as 200 regulars.

The late October Treaty of Easton with several Native tribes involved in the war largely dissolved the alliance that had enabled French military dominance in the region. Chiefs of 13 American Indian nations agreed to negotiate peace with the colonial governments of Pennsylvania and New Jersey and to abandon any alliances with the French. The nations were primarily the Six Nations of the Iroquois League, bands of the Lenape (Delaware), and the Shawnee. They agreed to the treaty based on the colonial governments&#x27; promising to respect their rights to hunting and territory in the Ohio Country, to prohibit establishing new settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains, and to withdraw British and colonial military troops after the war.

The French commander, anticipating an attack along Braddock&#x27;s road, had spent some effort fortifying positions there. (Forbes had several times advanced men along that route as a feint.) From prisoners captured during Maj. James Grant’s catastrophic attack on Fort Duquesne, de Lignery was reportedly surprised to learn of a fortified encampment of British troops only 50 miles away at Ligonier, Pennsylvania, with substantial reserves behind. He was also certainly cognizant of the British lightning raid on the Native village of Kittanning (40 miles north on the Allegheny River) two years earlier. Thus, a British attack from the north was a distinct possibility. Forbes had indeed contemplated an attack further north on Fort Machault (later, Ft. Venango; modern-day Franklin, PA.)

Finding himself in an under-manned, flood-prone fort in a weak defensive position, vulnerable to attack from three directions, and running low on provisions, de Lignery retreated north. He destroyed the stores and many of the structures as 1500 advance British troops under the command of Forbes drew within 10 miles. The French never returned to the region.

After constructing the temporary Mercer&#x27;s Fort, the British built a new fort and named it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt the Elder. The fort was built from 1759 to 1761 during the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War), next to the site of former Fort Duquesne. It was built in the popular pentagram shape, with bastions at the star points, by Captain Harry Gordon, a British Engineer in the 60th Royal American Regiment.

==Pontiac&#x27;s War==

After the colonial war and in the face of continued broken treaties, broken promises and encroachment by the Europeans, in 1763 the western Lenape and Shawnee took part in a Native uprising known as Pontiac&#x27;s War, an effort to drive settlers out of the Native American territory. The American Indians&#x27; siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but they found it too well-fortified to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, a Swiss mercenary and the commander of Fort Pitt, gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox. The potential of this act to cause an epidemic among the American Indians was clearly understood. Commander William Trent wrote that he hoped &quot;it will have the desired effect.&quot; Colonel Henry Bouquet, leading a relief force, would discuss similar tactics with Commander-in-Chief Jeffery Amherst. The effectiveness of these attempts to spread the disease are unknown, although it is known that the method used is inefficient compared to respiratory transmission, and it is difficult to differentiate from naturally occurring epidemics resulting from previous contacts with colonists.

During and after Pontiac&#x27;s War, epidemics of smallpox among Native Americans devastated the tribes of Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes areas. On August 1, 1763, most of the American Indians broke off the siege to intercept the approaching force under Colonel Bouquet. In the Battle of Bushy Run, Bouquet fought off the American Indian attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10.

In 1772, after Pontiac&#x27;s War, the British commander at Fort Pitt sold the building to two colonists, William Thompson and Alexander Ross. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by the colonies of both Virginia and Pennsylvania, which struggled for power over the region. After Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, they called it Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia&#x27;s Governor Lord Dunmore. The fort served as a staging ground in Dunmore&#x27;s War of 1774.

==American Revolutionary War and beyond==
During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt served as the American headquarters for the western theater of the war, while British forces garrisoned Fort Detroit at the present-day location of Detroit, Michigan.

By 1777, the Continental Congress had learned of efforts by Governor Henry Hamilton, British commander of the garrison at Fort Detroit, to incite Ohio country Indian nations and local American Loyalists against the lightly guarded American western border and feared an attack. In November 1777, Congress appointed three commissioners to travel to Fort Pitt and investigate and report on the situation of the Western Department. Specifically, Congress directed the commissioners “to investigate the rise, progress, and extent of the disaffection in that quarter, and take measures for suppressing the same.” The commissioners also were directed “to cultivate the friendship of the Shawanese and Delawares, and prevent our people from committing any outrages against them” and also were “empowered to engage as many of the Delaware and Shawanese warriors in the service of the United States.” In coordination with General Edward Hand, the Continental Army Western Department commander at Fort Pitt, the commissioners also were authorized to devise a plan for “carrying the war into the enemy&#x27;s country … to be extended against the British garrison at Detroit and its dependencies.” The commissioners included Colonel Samuel Washington (younger brother of George Washington) and Gabriel Jones, both from Virginia, and Colonel Joseph Reed from Pennsylvania. However, Reed declined the appointment and George Clymer was selected to take his place. Likewise, Washington and Jones also declined their appointments and so Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia appointed Sampson Mathews and Colonel Samuel McDowell to replace them. From Fort Pitt, the committee reported back to Congress the seriousness of the threat, recommending that 3,000 militiamen be sent to the western frontier.

As the commissioners were beginning their work at Fort Pitt in early 1778, Virginia also was taking steps to secure the western frontier. George Rogers Clark was commissioned a Lieutenant Colonel of the Illinois regiment of the Virginia State Forces with a plan to capture British held villages in the Illinois country and strike at Detroit. Clark organized his force in early 1778 at Redstone, a settlement on the Monongahela River south of Fort Pitt, and departed from there on May 12, 1778, proceeding on boats down the Monongahela to Fort Pitt where they picked up supplies before heading to the Falls of the Ohio. Clark was able to capture Kaskasia, Cahokia, and Vincennes in the Illinois country, but was not able to muster a force and march on Detroit. However, he was able to capture Hamilton in the winter of 1779 — a success that further encouraged the alliance with France that was forged after the American victory at Saratoga in the fall of 1777. 

Later, during the Northwest Indian War, General Anthony Wayne built a fort adjacent to the site as Fort Lafayette, elided to Fort Fayette. Still later it was regarrisioned in the War of 1812 as a staging point and supply depot for expeditions against northern British forts. Both forts became part of the borough of Pittsburgh.

==20th century==
In the 20th century, the city of Pittsburgh commissioned archeological excavation of the foundations of Fort Pitt. Afterward, some of the fort was reconstructed to give visitors at Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section, the Fort Pitt Museum is housed in the Monongahela Bastion, and excavated portions of the fort were filled in.

A redoubt, a small brick outbuilding called the Blockhouse, survives in Point State Park as the sole remnant of Fort Pitt. Erected in 1764, it is believed to be the oldest building still standing in Pittsburgh. Used for many years as a private residence, the blockhouse was purchased and preserved for many years by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing center for the Federal government during the Civil War, under the charge of William Metcalf.

<doc id="1219008" wikidata="Q1156739" url="?curid=1219008" title="Umbrella brand">
<text>Umbrella branding (also known as family branding) is a marketing practice involving the use of a single brand name for the sale of two or more related products. Umbrella branding is mainly used by companies with a positive brand equity (value of a brand in a certain marketplace). All products use the same means of identification and lack additional brand names or symbols etc. This marketing practice differs from brand extension in that umbrella branding involves the marketing of similar products, rather than differentiated products, under one brand name. Hence, umbrella branding may be considered as a type of brand extension. The practice of umbrella branding does not disallow a firm to implement different branding approaches for different product lines (e.g. brand extension).

== Strategy ==

Marketers may increase the chance of success for a new product launch by using a sub-brand name and a parent brand name simultaneously. In the article by Howard Pong Yuen LAM and other co-authors, they report the successful case of using two brand names—dual branding strategy—by practitioners in China for the Minute Maid Orange Pulp juice drink launch:A suggestive sub-brand name helps consumers recall the key benefits and features of the new product. A suggestive parent brand name communicates the benefits of the product category. A dual branding strategy addresses the problem of using only one brand name for a new product launch. After the successful launch of the first new product by a parent brand, marketers are able to launch other new products under other sub-brand names in the future to meet different consumer needs. Marketers may use the same parent brand to introduce different products to build scale for the brand, and are able to clearly differentiate the different product offerings under different sub-brand names. If a company acquires a brand from another company, a marketer may position the acquired brand as a sub-brand under the parent brand if the marketer has defined the business scope of the parent brand broadly enough and with a suggestive parent brand name.

== Purpose ==
Umbrella branding is used to provide uniformity to certain product lines by grouping them under a single brand name, making them more easily identifiable and hence enhancing their marketability. All products under the same corporate umbrella (masterbrand providing structure and credibility to other products of the corporation) are expected to have uniform quality and user experience (e.g. All products carrying the parent brand must be of the same high quality standards).

Factors that may determine the impact of umbrella branding include:
# The degree of commonality among the products falling under the corporate umbrella (e.g. Whether the products may act as substitutes for each other).
# The brand equity of a corporation (e.g. Whether the brand is known in its product market).

== Theories ==
Various theories attempt to explain a consumer&#x27;s decisions and judgements during product purchasing that cause umbrella branding to be a successful marketing strategy.

=== Categorization theory ===
The categorization theory is based upon the notion that consumers tend to categorize products by associating them to brands and their past experiences with those particular brands (stored in their category memory) in order to evade the initial confusion caused by the extensive choice of products they are presented with. New information on certain products are categorized into various sections such as product class (e.g. beverage) and brand (e.g. Coca-Cola) and then stored. Afterwards, consumers evaluate the product quality through past experiences with the brand&#x27;s products as well as the brand equity.

This theory also explains for the popularity of umbrella branding. Consumers tend to evaluate new products not only by positive brand equity but also if the brand&#x27;s concept is consistent with their extended products. For instance, assuming that the consumer had satisfactory past experiences with the company&#x27;s products, if Apple Inc. would develop and sell a new version of a Macbook, consumers would deem it more reliable and potentially of superior quality rather than if Apple would produce a new beverage due to Apple&#x27;s past product line.

=== Schema congruity theory ===
The schema congruity theory suggests that the storage of new information and retrieval of memory is majorly influenced by past expectations. Schemas are a human&#x27;s personal cognitive representations of the environment that guide their perceptions, thoughts and actions. Schemas go through constant change as a human experiences and learns new information. Nonetheless, the new information is firstly evaluated on the basis of existing schemas. Relating the theory to consumer evaluation of products, a consumer already possesses pre-existing schemas from past experiences with certain brands and therefore new products are evaluated based on the existing schema the consumer has with the certain brand. This theory is quite similar to the categorization theory; however, the schema congruity theory places emphasis on the consumer&#x27;s past experiences with the brand which is influenced by the surrounding environment.

=== Confirmation bias ===
Confirmation bias is a form of statistical bias, describing the tendency to seek for or interpret evidence in ways that support one&#x27;s existing beliefs. After a consumer creates a preference of one brand over others, any additional feature that may be common between various brands will most likely only strengthen the consumer&#x27;s pre-existing preference, causing them to disregard other brands. Hence, a positive brand equity may not be as influential if a consumer already has a pre-existing brand preference.

== Benefits ==
Umbrella branding has become a popular marketing practice utilized by companies due to its various potential benefits. Such marketing practice may create advertising efficiencies through the reduced costs of brand development. This strategy reduces a firm&#x27;s marketing costs due to the consumer-brand association through which consumers already recognize certain brands, making new products more easily identifiable. Consequently, the market entry for umbrella branded products is relatively inexpensive since reputable brands can take advantage of past marketing efforts. Furthermore, a company benefits from advertising efficiencies since umbrella branding focuses on the promotion of a single brand rather, than multiple ones. For instance, Apple Inc. adds new products (e.g. Macbook Pro, Apple Watch) to their line and benefits from past marketing since consumers use previous information to make an inference about a product with the same brand name, allowing Apple to focus on promoting the corporate brand, rather than multiple individual brands. Additionally, the use of umbrella branding does not prevent companies from implementing other methods of brand extension, enabling them to remain flexible with marketing strategies. Finally, the success of one umbrella branded product may translate to other products under the same corporate umbrella due to the positive brand equity.

== Risks ==
A major risk of utilizing umbrella branding is that it may result unsuccessful in promoting new products if the company does not have a strong brand equity. Secondly, the consumer&#x27;s experience with one umbrella branded product may affect their perception of other products and services falling under the same corporate umbrella as well as the brand itself. Consequently, if one umbrella branded product does not satisfy the consumer&#x27;s expectations, the other products sold under the same brand are also likely to suffer. Thus, the company might result in a negative brand equity (also known as brand equity dilution). Thirdly, umbrella branding is only beneficial when promoting relatable products through which consumers could recognize the brand. For instance, the Starbucks brand is associated to coffee-related products and therefore consumers would mainly recognize the brand on products related to the specific market. Lastly, cannibalization (reduction in sales volume due to the introduction of a new product by the same company) may result when related products are introduced under the same corporate brand as internal product competition will lead to consumers choosing between products from the same brand, stunting future investment into product creation of the same product line under the corporate umbrella.

== Popular usage ==
Starbucks Corporation, Virgin Group, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Apple Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company are examples of multinational companies that use umbrella branding in some of their product lines.

=== Starbucks Corporation ===
Starbucks Corporation (operating as Starbucks coffee) is an American multinational coffee company, which markets all of their products under their corporate brand name. Some products produced by Starbucks include:
* Starbucks Coffee – Various types of coffees.
* Starbucks Tea – Various types of teas.
* Starbucks Drink-ware – Various types of drink-ware such as cups, mugs and tumblers.
* Starbucks Equipment – Various types of equipment such as coffee machines.
* Starbucks Syrups and Toppings – Various types of syrups and toppings.

=== Virgin Group ===

Virgin Group Ltd. is a British multinational branded investment corporation. Virgin is one of the world&#x27;s most recognized brands, which has used various types of brand extensions, including umbrella branding. Virgin has 33 branches that operate under the Virgin name; however, the practice of umbrella branding is observed in their industry-specific brands (e.g. Virgin Drinks, which was a subsidiary of Virgin Group that marketed Virgin Cola and Virgin Vodka) including:
* Virgin Green Fund
* Virgin Atlantic
* Virgin Books
* Virgin Games
* Virgin Vacations
* Virgin Spa
* Virgin Life Care

=== Procter &amp; Gamble ===

Procter &amp; Gamble (also known as P&amp;G) is an American multinational corporation, providing a range of consumer products. Although P &amp; G create individual product brands (e.g. Pampers or Pantene), umbrella branding is implemented within the individual brands. Some individual brands owned by P&amp;G include:
* Pantene – Brand of haircare products, including shampoos, dry shampoos, conditioners, moistures, hair-styling products and others.
*Oral-B – Brand of oral-hygiene products such as toothbrushes, toothpastes, dental floss and mouthwashes.

*Vicks – Brand of over-the-counter medication including medication for cold &amp; flu, cough relief, sinus relief and occasional sleeplessness.

P&amp;G create individual brands for different product lines and then implement umbrella branding within those brands in order to control profitable market sections.

<text>Marduk is a Swedish black metal band formed in Norrköping in 1990. The band released their debut full-length album, &quot;Dark Endless&quot;, in 1992 on No Fashion Records. Their name is taken from the Ancient Babylonian deity, Marduk.

==History==
Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson, the band&#x27;s guitarist, formed Marduk with the intention of being the &quot;most blasphemous band in the world&quot;. Concerning the band&#x27;s two initial releases, the 1991 EP, &quot;Fuck Me Jesus&quot;, and their debut album, &quot;Dark Endless&quot;, released the subsequent year, Marduk can be sonically defined as black metal which interwove significant influence from death metal. For both of these releases, the band&#x27;s lineup consisted of the aforementioned Morgan, Andreas &#x27;Dread&#x27; Axelsson as vocalist, Magnus &#x27;Devo&#x27; Andersson as guitarist, Rikard Kalm as bassist, and Joakim &#x27;Av Gravf&#x27; Göthberg as drummer, while Dan Swanö of Edge of Sanity mixed both albums.

Nonetheless, the stability of this line-up was ruptured following the release of &quot;Dark Endless&quot; when both Dread and Richard Kalm departed from the band. After which, Av Gravf assumed the additional position of vocalist while Roger &#x27;B. War&#x27; Svensson assumed the position of bass player, consequently recording their second full-length album, &quot;Those of the Unlight&quot;, in April 1993, again being mixed by the aforementioned Swanö. Subsequently, released on 1 October 1993, &quot;Those of the Unlight&quot; demarcated a noteworthy sonic excursion for the band, as this album manifested a more melodic black metal sound that repudiated the death metal undergirding of Marduk&#x27;s body of work thusfar. The band elaborated upon this style on &quot;Opus Nocturne&quot;, released on 12 December 1994, which, concerning personnel, was signified by the addition of Fredrik Andersson on drums, with Av Gravf forsaking this position to concentrate specifically on vocal delivery, and the departure of Devo.

Stability had not yet been attained by the band, however, as Av Gravf opted to depart from Marduk in 1995, citing boredom as the primary instigator for this decision. Wherefore, Marduk recruited Erik &#x27;Legion&#x27; Hagstedt, formerly of Swedish black metal band Ophthalamia, as vocalist. This development was further characterised by the band opting to record their fourth full-length album, &quot;Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered&quot;, with Peter Tägtgren of Hypocrisy fame at The Abyss Studio in January 1996, antecedent to the album&#x27;s release on 1 July 1996.

This line-up of the band, with the exception of Fredrik Andersson departing in 2002 only to be replaced by Emil Dragutinovic, remained largely unscathed, releasing &quot;Nightwing&quot;, &quot;Panzer Division Marduk&quot;, &quot;La Grande Danse Macabre&quot;, and &quot;World Funeral&quot;, all of which the aforementioned Tägtgren mixed, in 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2003 respectively. Nonetheless, attributing his decision to both dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s musical direction and the diminishment of interpersonal relations within the band, Legion departed from the band in 2003, followed by B. War the subsequent year. Consequently, Legion was replaced by Daniel &#x27;Mortuus&#x27; Rostén, renowned for his work within Funeral Mist, while Devo returned to the band, this time assuming the position of bassist.

In September 2016, Marduk intended to tour the United States with Carach Angren, Rotting Christ, and Necronomicon but was forced to cancel this endeavour as a result of unresolved delays in acquiring visas. In late February 2017, Marduk&#x27;s prospective show at Oakland was cancelled by the venue for fears of security issues after a local anti-fascist group targeted the band and reportedly threatened the venue staff. In April 2018, accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies resurfaced after the news site published an article alleging that Fredrik Widigs and Daniel Rostén had placed orders from the Nordic Resistance Movement web shop, according to leaked files from NRM servers. The band have denied these accusations, as well as any connection to the Nordic Resistance Movement.

Marduk released their latest studio album, &quot;Viktoria&quot;, on 22 June 2018. In 2019, Devo announced that he was leaving the band to focus on studio work, being replaced by Joel Lindholm in 2020.

In May 2023, Marduk announced that bassist Joel Lindholm had left the band, after video showed him apparently making a Nazi salute during their performance at Incineration Fest in London. Guitarist Morgan Håkansson called the incident &quot;deplorable&quot;. The band said they were not made aware until after the show, adding that Lindholm was &quot;very drunk&quot; and carried out &quot;a variety of intolerable stage antics&quot;. The band was booked to play Bangkok, Thailand in 2023. 

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
The band&#x27;s two initial releases, the 1991 EP, &quot;Fuck Me Jesus&quot;, and their debut album, &quot;Dark Endless&quot;, combine black metal with death metal. The band&#x27;s second and third albums &quot;Those of the Unlight&quot; and &quot;Opus Nocturne&quot;, showed a more melodic black metal approach, with the latter hinting at a more chaotic, blast beat-driven style that would be further explored on subsequent albums like &quot;Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered&quot;, &quot;Nightwing&quot;, and &quot;Panzer Division Marduk&quot;.

Concerning the thematic nature of Marduk&#x27;s lyrics, the lyrics primarily incorporate Satanism, anti-Christianity, blasphemy, death, Third Reich history, and World War II. Marduk began incorporating the war themes on their 1999 album, &quot;Panzer Division Marduk&quot;, which continued on in later years such as &quot;The Hangman of Prague&quot; on 2004&#x27;s &quot;Plague Angel&quot;, the title being a reference to Reinhard Heydrich — second in command of the SS — in his capacity as the &quot;de facto&quot; Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia.

Her first novel, &quot;Children of the Shaman&quot;, was published by Orbit in 2001, and was short-listed for the Locus magazine best first novel in 2002. A sequel, &quot;The Glass Mountain&quot;, appeared in October 2002. A short story, &quot;The Anniversary&quot;, was published in an anthology printed by NewCon Press in 2010 to celebrate the fifth anniversary of The Write Fantastic.

Both books have been reissued by small press Kristell Ink Publishing, together with sequels &quot;Malarat&quot; and &quot;Winterbloom&quot;. They have cover art by artist Daniele Serra and &quot;Children of the Shaman&quot; also has internal illustrations by Evelinn Enoksen, who designed the maps. After publication of &quot;Children of the Shaman&quot;, the three remaining books were released through Amazon in February 2019 and are available from many booksellers.

Rydill&#x27;s first three books are set in the alternate world of Mir, with elements of Slavic Fantasy, but &quot;Winterbloom&quot; is the first in which part of the action takes place in the real world, in her home-town, the city of Bath, and features a number of historical figures from Dr John Dee to Aleister Crowley.

Her sister Sarah Ash, author of the Tears of Artamon trilogy, the &quot;Tide Dragons&quot; series and many other works, is also a fantasy novelist.

<text>Sir Hugh William Bell Cairns (26 June 1896 – 18 July 1952) was an Australian neurosurgeon. For most of his life he lived in England. His concern about despatch rider injuries sparked research which led to increased use of motorcycle helmets.

==Early years and education==
Hugh Cairns was born in Port Pirie, South Australia, but spent his early childhood in Riverton, South Australia where he received all of his primary school education. He went to Adelaide for his secondary education at Adelaide High School and tertiary education at the University of Adelaide. He was awarded the 1917 South Australian Rhodes Scholarship and went to the University of Oxford to read Medicine. He was president of the Balliol Boat Club and represented Oxford at seven in the Boat Race of 1920.

==Career==
Cairns worked as a neurosurgeon at the London Hospital and with Harvey Cushing at Harvard before setting up the Nuffield Department of Surgery in Oxford, in which he became the first Nuffield Professor of Surgery. He was a key figure in the development of neurosurgery as a speciality, the formation of the Oxford University Medical School, and the treatment of head injuries during the Second World War. The Cairns Library (one of the Bodleian Libraries) at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford is named after him, as is the medical school Hugh Cairns Surgical Society. A blue plaque for him at his 1920s residence at Loughton has been erected.

In June 1946 he received the title of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

While at the London Hospital and in Oxford, Cairns trained US-born surgeon Joseph Buford Pennybacker, who in 1952 took over as director of the Radcliffe&#x27;s neurosurgery department, a job he held until he retired in 1971.

Profoundly affected by treating T. E. Lawrence for head injuries during the six days before the latter died after a motorcycle accident, Cairns began a long study of what he saw as the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle despatch riders through head injuries. His research led to the use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists. As a consequence of treating Lawrence, Cairns would ultimately save the lives of many motorcyclists.

==Death and legacy==
He died of cancer at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford on 18 July 1952. The Society of British Neurological Surgeons established an annual lecture in his name. There is a road named after him at Bedford Park, South Australia, adjacent to Flinders Medical Centre.

A ward at the Walton Centre, Liverpool, is named after him.

<text>Brigadier General John Vaughan Campbell, (31 October 1876 – 21 May 1944) was a senior British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Campbell was born in London. His father, Ronald George Elidor Campbell (1848–1879), was the second son of the 2nd Earl Cawdor and an army captain, was killed at the Battle of Hlobane in the Zulu War in 1879.

He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before entering the Coldstream Guards in 1896. He served through the Second Boer War, in which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and twice mentioned in despatches.

==First World War==
Campbell was 39 years old, and a temporary lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 15 September 1916 at Ginchy, France, during the Battle of the Somme, Lieutenant Colonel Campbell took personal command of the third line when the first two waves of his battalion had been decimated by machine-gun and rifle fire. He rallied his men and led them against the enemy machine-guns, capturing the guns and killing the personnel. Later in the day he again rallied the survivors of his battalion and led them through very heavy hostile fire. His personal gallantry and initiative at a very critical moment enabled the division to press on and capture objectives of the highest tactical importance.

Not mentioned in the citation but much reported in the popular press, by which he was dubbed the &quot;Tally-Ho VC&quot;, is that he rallied his men under fire by blowing a hunting horn and giving the traditional hunting cry.

Later in November 1916, he achieved the rank of brigadier general.

==Later life==
In 1919 he was appointed aide-de-camp to King George V, a post held until he retired from the army in 1933, and was subsequently a member of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms until his death.

In the Second World War he was an honorary flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1939 to 1940, then from 1941 until his death commanded the 8th Battalion Gloucestershire Home Guard. He died, aged sixty-seven, at his last home in Woodchester near Stroud, on 21 May 1944, and was cremated at Cheltenham Crematorium.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Coldstream Guards RHQ) in Wellington Barracks, London.

<doc id="1219028" wikidata="Q17664052" url="?curid=1219028" title="Fort Pitt, Kent">
<text>Fort Pitt is a Napoleonic era fort on the high ground of the boundary between Chatham and Rochester, Kent.

A fort on the site was proposed as early as 1779 by Hugh Debbieg, then Chief Engineer at Chatham. In 1783 the land was purchased by the Board of Ordnance and 4.5 million bricks were deposited there in preparation for construction. (Nothing immediately followed, however, and the bricks were instead used for the rebuilding of the Lines).

The fort was finally built between 1805 and 1819. At that point, the Napoleonic Wars having ended, it ceased being manned as a fort and instead became an important military hospital. In the 1820s-50s it was the only General (as opposed to regimental) Military Hospital in England, and, until the opening of Netley Hospital in 1863, it was considered the &quot;de facto&quot; Headquarters of the Army Medical Department. Fort Pitt Hospital closed in the 1920s, since when the surviving buildings have housed a girls&#x27; grammar school.

==History==
===The original hospital===

In 1793 Chatham was one of five sites selected by the new Army Medical Board for the establishment of a General (as opposed to regimental) Hospital. Towards the end of the century an establishment of medical personnel was appointed and work was begun on the hospital building. The intention had been that the hospital would function as part of the &#x27;Depôt of Recruits and Invalids&#x27; which had been established at Chatham in the 1770s. In June 1801, however, the Depôt was removed to Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight (to be closer to Spithead, the usual embarkation point for troops serving overseas). The Depôt Hospital establishment went with it; so when the hospital building was finally completed, towards the end of that year, it found itself without a function. Two years later, at the start of the Napoleonic Wars, the hospital was finally opened in an attempt to re-establish a General Hospital for the army at Chatham; but it did not prove successful (a later report by the Commissioners of Military Enquiry described the facility at that time as being fully equipped with an establishment of &#x27;Officers, Stewards, Nurses, &amp;c.&#x27;, but &#x27;without a single patient&#x27;). Over the next year or so, the hospital was gradually run down and it closed in April 1805; later that same year the building was turned over to barrack accommodation, and the fort was constructed around it.

===The Fort===

Construction of a fort on the site began in 1805, in response to renewed fears of a French invasion. Named after Prime Minister William Pitt (who had died in 1806), Fort Pitt was planned as part of the defences overlooking the River Medway: Fort Clarence, Fort Amherst and the Great Lines were visible from Fort Pitt, the whole providing a defensive ring to protect Chatham Dockyard from landward attack. A further concern (with the potential of invasion in mind) was to guard the approaches to Rochester Bridge, which was a key river crossing on the most direct route from the south-east coast to London.

By 1813 it was more or less complete (although some works remained to be done). It has been described as a &#x27;remarkable hybrid&#x27;: it was among the very last bastioned forts to be built in England (as the style was by then obsolescent), but integrated into its form were multi-storey brick gun towers, representing the latest fashion in fortification.

====Description====

Fort Pitt was laid out as an irregular polygon with a bastion at each corner. Formed of a combination of red-brick walls and earthworks, the fort was surrounded by a deep defensive trench, beyond which was a substantial glacis. A ravelin was built across the ditch to the south (and connected to the fort by a caponier); within the walls at this point were a pair of cavaliers (raised gun platforms). Placed off-centre in the middle of the fort was a substantial tower or keep (akin to the surviving tower at nearby Fort Clarence): three storeys high with a gun platform on its flat roof. In line with the tower to the north, projecting out from the fortification like a hornwork, was a detached blockhouse containing casemated barracks with accommodation for up to 500 soldiers. This also functioned as a multi-tiered gun platform, and had a flat roof for gun emplacements. The blockhouse was outside the fort but attached to it, so as to allow the occupants to withdraw into the fort in the event of an attack; it was built on a massive scale, cut into the hillside and flanked by dry moats revetted with bricks. It dominated views of the fort from Chatham and the north.

Two outlying towers were also built, one on each flank, named &#x27;Delce&#x27; and &#x27;Gibraltar&#x27;; the former was linked to the fort by a covered way. Each were brick towers, two storeys high with magazines and stores at basement level. Built with musketry loopholes and equipped (in the case of Delce) with a pair of 18-pound carronades, they were designed to control road access to the bridge: Delce to the west defended the approach from the south, Gibraltar to the east defended the approach from Chatham.

====Armament====
Until the 1820s the fort was armed with ten 18-pound cannons, twenty-two 18-pound carronades and four 10-pound mortars.

Its function was described in 1822 as follows:
&#x27;Fort Pitt, scarped with masonry and bastioned [...] is the largest of all the works which cover Chatham, and the nearest to the citadel, the fire of which crosses its own. On the opposite quarter, the fire of Fort Pitt crosses that of Fort Clarence [...] The flanks of Fort Pitt are provided with carronades in frames turning upon pivots to sweep the different parts of the ditch. The gorge of the fort presents a front of fortification, casemated with embrasures, to command in reverse the town of Chatham, and the course of the Medway&#x27;.

According to the same description the central tower of the fort was described as being &#x27;armed at the summit with two long guns to batter in front, and two carronades to protect the gorge. This was at the epoch when the rage for building martello towers had seized the British government [...] The tower in Fort Pitt is very lofty, and its object is to command at a considerable distance the brow of a hill which raises itself with an insensible slope in front of Fort Pitt&#x27;.

===Invalid Depôt and General Military Hospital===

The end of the Napoleonic Wars meant that the site was not finally used as a fort, and in 1814 the soldiers garrisoning the fort were redeployed. For a brief time it was occupied by the Royal Marine Artillery, due to shortage of accommodation elsewhere, but in 1815 they were removed to make way for wounded from the Battle of Waterloo.

In 1819 the Army&#x27;s Invalid Depôt was moved back from the Isle of Wight to Chatham, and Fort Pitt was repurposed as a medical establishment to treat soldiers prior to their release from service. At the same time, the nearby Fort Clarence was converted into a military lunatic asylum.

In the same year, York Hospital, Chelsea (the Army&#x27;s last remaining General Hospital) was closed to serving soldiers, and Fort Pitt began to be established as Britain&#x27;s principal military hospital. In 1822 the casemates were said to be &#x27;at present inhabited by invalids, who compose the only garrison of this fortress&#x27;.

The hospital building was expanded in 1823-4, with eight large wards of twenty-seven beds each providing room for over 200 patients. The H-plan hospital building was flanked by smaller blocks to the north and to the south, which served as officers&#x27; quarters.

Fort Pitt also functioned as the Medical Staff Depôt: &#x27;all candidates for commissions, and young medical officers who had just received commissions, were in the first instance sent down to Fort Pitt; partly in order that, when the exigences of the public service permitted, they might receive a certain amount of training in the special work as army surgeons, and partly also because the Staff Depôt formed a convenient place of residence for them until they could be drafted to their respective destinations&#x27;. In 1816 the Director General of the Army Medical Department, James McGrigor, had brought from Chelsea a collection of anatomical specimens and other items of interest with a view to establishing a medical museum at Fort Pitt. At the same time he endowed a library on the site, and issued instructions to the army&#x27;s medical officers stationed around the globe to send six-monthly reports of prevalent diseases, treatments and various treatments which were collated at Fort Pitt and made available for analysis and study. The museum and library expanded prodigiously over the years and Fort Pitt became an important centre for the study of military and tropical medicine. (By 1851 the library had amassed a collection of 67,000 volumes, and the museum contained 41,000 specimens and numerous anatomical drawings.)
In 1846 the military lunatic asylum was moved out of Fort Clarence (and away from Chatham, to the vacant Naval Hospital complex in Great Yarmouth); the following year a smaller &quot;asylum for insane soldiers&quot; was opened in the north-west corner of Fort Pitt, in a former barrack block, (albeit as a place of &#x27;observation and temporary probation&#x27; rather than one of ongoing care and treatment).
By the 1850s Fort Pitt was a major military hospital, with most of the soldiers invalided to Britain from abroad assessed there prior to their discharge. This included most of the sick and wounded from the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny (Queen Victoria came to Fort Pitt on three separate occasions in 1855 to visit soldiers wounded in the Crimea.) Florence Nightingale described, at that time, the process whereby &#x27;When a ship arrives with invalids, the bedridden are carried to Fort Pitt, and the convalescents are marched to St Mary&#x27;s Casemates&#x27;. (Those at Fort Pitt were under &#x27;hospital discipline&#x27;, whereas those at St Mary&#x27;s were under &#x27;a kind of regimental discipline under the adjutant&#x27;.) During the period of the war in Crimea a total of 14,700 soldiers passed through the Central Invalid Depôt of the British Army at Chatham.

At some stage the blockhouse at Fort Pitt had been converted into a &#x27;casemate hospital&#x27; with five casemated wards. In the 1840-50s two of the casemates were appropriated for the sick women and children of the garrison, for whom it was the only hospital provision available; in the year ending March 1857, 26 sick women (and 7 infectious), 12 sick children (and 31 infectious) and 20 lying-in women were treated there. In 1854 psychiatric patients were returned to Fort Pitt from Yarmouth (the hospital there having been requisitioned by the Navy) and housed temporarily &#x27;in the &quot;pit&quot; or casemates&#x27;, a place described as being &#x27;most unfit&#x27;: &#x27;even the temporary confinement of a lunatic, in a place so destitute of the means of ameliorating his mental condition, must materially lessen the chance of his recovery&#x27;.

In 1860 Fort Pitt was selected by Florence Nightingale as the initial site for the new Army Medical School; however, this was only a temporary measure pending the imminent opening of a new General Military Hospital at Netley, near Southampton, which took place in 1863. Along with the Army Medical School, the museum and library were moved to Netley in 1863 and the following year the Invalid Depôt was removed from Chatham to Netley, prompting a reassessment of the function and use of Fort Pitt.

===Garrison Hospital===
The Army Sanitary Commissioners had in 1863 approved a proposal for the facilities at Fort Pitt to be converted into &#x27;a Hospital for the whole of the troops of the garrison, including the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers, and the three depots battalions of infantry&#x27;. The following year additional buildings were erected &#x27;for the reception of the whole of the troops of the garrison requiring hospital treatment&#x27;; at the same time, the old separate Garrison Hospital within the lines at Brompton was closed and its premises converted into barracks.

A major expansion of the hospital at Fort Pitt was begun in 1910, necessitating the demolition of the western wings of the old H-plan hospital and also the removal of the Napoleonic-era tower/keep, to make way for a new central hospital block (which was linked to the old hospital on one side, and a new West Wing on the other). This pavilion-plan hospital extension (which contained two new operating theatres, an x-ray department and other modern facilities) opened just before the outbreak of war in 1914.

In October 1914 King George V and Queen Mary visited, meeting servicemen wounded in the First World War, including five German Naval officers held in a separate ward. At least seventy German prisoners were treated at the Fort. On recovery, they were held in the Blockhouse until the end of the war. 

The hospital closed in 1922; its patients were transferred to the Royal Naval Hospital, Chatham.

===Grammar School===

In 1929 the Chatham Education Board bought the vacant Fort Pitt from the War Office, and the site was converted into a Girls&#x27; Technical School. The school, now known as Fort Pitt Grammar School, remains on the site and has added a number of new buildings. The neighbouring University for the Creative Arts building occupies the old blockhouse site and some of the original brickwork remains visible at the sides of the building.

==Present day==

The site continues to be of national historical significance and substantial sections of the ramparts are still clearly discernible. Several of the fort&#x27;s original buildings have not survived above ground level: Gibraltar Tower was demolished in 1879 and Delce Tower, by then a ruin, was probably demolished shortly afterwards. The central tower, or keep, was removed in 1910 when the hospital was extended; and the blockhouse was demolished in the early 1930s, to allow the school to expand (the Rochester campus of the University for the Creative Arts now stands on its site). Nevertheless, much of the outer walls of the fort survive including parts of the outer defences which extend into the adjacent recreation grounds to the east and west. The tunnels of the fort also survive, but are partly filled in.

Furthermore, several of the old hospital buildings remain in place as part of the school. The Music House (the former &#x27;insane asylum&#x27;) in the school grounds and the “Crimea Wing” teaching block (the original Napoleonic-era hospital) are both listed buildings, with some of the old hospital ward numbers still visible on the Crimea Wing&#x27;s walls. Several other buildings also date to the period of use as a hospital, including the North Block (which was first erected as a temporary building to house the Army Medical School in 1860) and the West Wing of the 1914 extension (its main central block having been destroyed in a fire in 1973).

==Military cemetery==

The Fort Pitt Military Cemetery, created initially to serve the hospital, lies a quarter of a mile to the south of the fort by the A229 road from Rochester to Maidstone. The graves, dating from the mid-19th century onwards, include 290 of Commonwealth service personnel from the World Wars, 265 from World War I, who lie in an extensive plot, and 25 from World War II who are mainly buried in a group north of that plot.

==In literature==
As a boy, Charles Dickens lived at 2 Ordnance Terrace, a quarter of a mile to the east of Fort Pitt, and the fort is the location of the fictional duel between Mr. Nathaniel Winkle and Dr. Slammer in his novel &quot;The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club&quot;.

<text>Georg Sverdrup (born Jørgen Sverdrup; 25 April 1770 – 8 December 1850) was a Norwegian statesman, best known as one of the presidents of the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll Manor in 1814. He was a member of the Norwegian Parliament and was also responsible for the development of the first Norwegian university library.

==Biography==
Georg Sverdrup was born in the fishing village of Laugen in the prestegjeld of Nærøy in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. He was the uncle of brothers Harald Ulrik Sverdrup, who served as a member of Norwegian Parliament, and Johan Sverdrup, who was the Prime Minister of Norway. Georg Sverdrup, the Norwegian-American Lutheran theologian, was his great-nephew.

Georg Sverdrup entered the University of Copenhagen during 1794 and graduated with a degree in philology in 1798. During the period 1798–1799, he studied at the University of Göttingen.

He represented Christiania at the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly during 1814 at Eidsvoll Manor. He was the last president of the Assembly, chosen the second last day, 16 May. He led the election of the king and gave the closing speech. During the drafting of the Norwegian constitution, Sverdrup was one of the principle authors of the Jew clause, which prohibited Jews from entering Norway. He was later elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1817 and 1823.

Sverdrup became professor of Greek at the University of Copenhagen in 1805. Sverdrup was librarian of the university library from 1813 to 1845. The University of Oslo was established in 1811 under the name Royal Frederick University, but due to the Napoleonic War it was not until 1815 that Sverdrup could receive the 50,000 volumes, then in Copenhagen, intended for the new university library. It took another year for the government to provide adequate localities for the collection, and not until 1828 was the library finally completed, with a total of 90,000 volumes.

Georg Sverdrup is buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund. Sverdrups gate in the district of Grünerløkka in Oslo was named in his honor. The new university library at Blindern (&quot;Georg Sverdrups hus – Universitetsbibliotekets&quot;), finished in 1999, is named after Georg Sverdrup. It houses more than 2,000,000 books.

<text>Geoffrey St. George Shillington Cather (11 October 1890 – 2 July 1916) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the Royal Irish Fusiliers during the First World War, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 1 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
Cather was born in Streatham Hill, south-west London, on 11 October 1890 to R. G. Cather, who worked for the tea merchant company Joseph Tetley &amp; Co., and his wife Margaret . His mother was the sister of the politician David Graham Shillington. He was educated at Hazelwood School in Limpsfield before going onto Rugby School. His schooling was curtailed in his mid-teens by the death of his father. He went to work for his late father&#x27;s company, Joseph Tetley &amp; Co. He spent much of the period from 1911 to 1914 in the United States and Canada on business.

==First World War==
On 3 September 1914, Cather enlisted in the British Army&#x27;s Artists Rifles. He already had some military experience, having served for two years in the Territorial Force with the 19th Royal Fusiliers from 1909 to early 1911. The following May, he requested a transfer to the Royal Irish Fusiliers on account of his parents both being from Northern Ireland. He was accordingly granted a commission in the 9th Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers, which was part of the 36th (Ulster) Division.

Sent to the French sector of the Western Front in October 1915, Cather was soon promoted to lieutenant and became adjutant of the battalion. The following July, the 36th Division took part in the Battle of the Somme. On 1 July 1916, the opening day of the battle, Cather&#x27;s battalion was tasked with capturing Beaucourt Station, near Beaumont-Hamel. However, there were heavy casualties amongst 9th Battalion and the adjacent 12th Battalion, and the Irish had to return to their starting positions leaving behind many wounded in no man&#x27;s land. That night, Cather went out to locate and bring in wounded. He was able to retrieve three men before retiring for the night. The next morning he went out again to locate more survivors but was killed by machinegun fire. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows:
Originally buried near where he was killed, Cather&#x27;s grave was later lost. His name is listed on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing, which was established near Thiepval in Picardy. A plaque to his memory is on the walls of the main building of Hazelwood School, which he attended in his youth; and he is listed on the Royal Fusiliers Regimental Memorial in St Anne&#x27;s Cathedral in Belfast.

==Victoria Cross==
King George V presented Cather&#x27;s VC to his mother on 31 March 1917, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He was also entitled to the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. His VC and other medals were later donated by his brother to the Royal Irish Fusiliers Museum in Armagh, Northern Ireland.

<text>Avon and Somerset Police is the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement in the five unitary authority areas of Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset, Somerset, and South Gloucestershire, all in South West England.

, the force had 2,965 police officers, 299 special constables, and 330 police community support officers. The force serves 1.72million people over an area of .

According to a House of Commons Library report, as of March 2023, Avon and Somerset Police had 3,330 Police Constables and 235 Special Constables.

==History==
The police area covered by Avon &amp; Somerset Police today can trace its policing heritage back to the very start of the modern policing system. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 created municipal boroughs across England and Wales, each with the power to create a borough police force. Before then, policing was largely unrecognisable from today&#x27;s system, with watchmen and parish constables providing variable levels of law enforcement, if any, driven largely by magistrates. As a result of the Act the following borough police forces were created within the current Avon and Somerset Police area: Bath City Police (1836), Bristol Constabulary (1836), Bridgwater Borough Police (1836), Wells City Police (1836), Glastonbury Borough Police, Chard Borough Police (1839), and Yeovil Borough Police (1854).

However, outside the new boroughs there was no modern police. Therefore, the government introduced the County Police Act 1839 which permitted county authorities to set up county forces to police areas outside of the boroughs. Following these Acts, Gloucestershire Constabulary was created in 1839, which covered what is now the north part of the Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary area (South Gloucestershire). But there was still some opposition to the new model of policing, and rural Somerset had no police force until 1856. The County and Borough Police Act 1856 mandated county authorities to set up a constabulary. Somerset Constabulary commenced policing the county in 1856, and Wells City Police and Glastonbury Borough Police were merged into the new county force almost immediately; Yeovil Borough Police followed a year later.

Later in the 19th century the Local Government Act 1888 required that all boroughs with populations of less than 10,000 amalgamate their police force with the adjoining county constabulary. This signalled the end of Chard Borough Police, which merged into Somerset Constabulary on 1 April 1888. In 1940, Bridgwater Borough Police voluntarily became part of Somerset constabulary, with the 20 officers of the borough police becoming Somerset County officers upon merger.

During the 20th century, the number of separate police forces in the United Kingdom was reduced on grounds of efficiency. The Police Act 1964 gave the Home Secretary the power to enforce amalgamations, but this was not required when Somerset Constabulary and Bath City Police voluntarily agreed to merge forming the Somerset and Bath Constabulary on 1 January 1967. This resulted in three police forces covering the current area of the Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary: Somerset and Bath Constabulary, Bristol Constabulary, and Gloucestershire Constabulary (in the far north). The next change was on 1 April 1974, with the implementation the Local Government Act 1972, which created Avon and Somerset Constabulary, a merger of Somerset and Bath Constabulary, Bristol Constabulary, and the southern part of Gloucestershire Constabulary.

In 2014, the force announced that in order to reduce its budget, it would close 12 local police stations as part of a planned 36% reduction of the number of buildings it occupied. Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens said these buildings were &quot;outdated&quot; and &quot;under-occupied&quot;. The stations were seven in Bristol, and those in Bath, Keynsham, Nailsea, Radstock and Weston-super-Mare.

===Proposed mergers===
In 2006, the Home Office announced plans to reduce the number of police forces in the UK from 42 to 24 to try to save money. The plans were abandoned later that year due to lack of funding; but the idea has resurfaced many times. The proposal would have seen Avon and Somerset Constabulary merge with Gloucestershire Constabulary, Devon and Cornwall Police, Wiltshire Police and Dorset Police to form a &quot;super police force&quot;. The plans were publicly criticised by all the forces involved, stating that it would lead to poor quality service and a reduction in local policing.

In February 2010, plans for a merger of the five South West police forces (Avon and Somerset; Wiltshire; Dorset; Gloucestershire; and Devon and Cornwall) were re-evaluated by the Home Office in a bid to reduce spending. All of the forces except Avon and Somerset were against an amalgamation. Following this, Avon and Somerset Constabulary began purchasing uniform and equipment without the force crest. Instead, identifying marks just read &#x27;Police&#x27; without a force crest or reference to Avon and Somerset.

===Chief constables===

Colin Port served as the chief constable from January 2005. In November 2012, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) Sue Mountstevens announced that she would invite applications for the role rather than extending his contract. Port then decided not to re-apply for the position, and retired in March 2013. In January 2013, Port took the PCC to court to seek an injunction to block the interviews of candidates for the post of chief constable, but his case did not succeed.

Nick Gargan was appointed as the next chief constable in March 2013. In mid-May 2014, Gargan was suspended by the PCC following allegations of &quot;inappropriate behaviour towards female officers and staff&quot;. The enquiry into the allegations was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Gargan was reported by the PCC to have denied the allegations. During the first part of Gargan&#x27;s suspension, the force was run by Deputy Chief Constable John Long. He stood down as acting chief constable at the end of August 2015, and was replaced by Gareth Morgan, who was serving as deputy chief constable for Long. Gargan resigned from the position in October 2015.

Morgan continued serving as acting chief constable after Gargan&#x27;s resignation until the PCC appointed Andy Marsh, the former chief constable of the Hampshire Constabulary, as the new chief constable in February 2016.

In April 2021, Marsh announced that he would not be renewing his contract in July 2021. Following Marsh&#x27;s departure, Deputy Chief Constable Sarah Crew took over as Temporary Chief Constable, and was confirmed in the role on 25 November 2021.


===Officers killed in the line of duty===

The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers. Officers killed include:
* Superintendent William Balkwill (Somerset Constabulary), 1900: Fatally injured while restraining a violent prisoner
* DC Reginald Charles Grady (Bristol Constabulary), 1945: Collapsed and died during a violent arrest
* PC David George Petch, 1981, aged 31: Killed when his traffic patrol car crashed following a speeding car
* PC Peter Leonard Deans and PC Jonathan Michael Stapley, 1984: During a car chase their vehicle crashed and Deans and Stapley were fatally injured
* WPC Deborah Leat, 1986: During a car chase Leat&#x27;s vehicle crashed and she was fatally injured
* PC Stephen Jones, 1999: Died after being hit by a stolen vehicle he was attempting to stop

==Governance==

The force is overseen by the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner, an elected position which replaced the Avon and Somerset Police Authority in November 2012. The police and crime commissioner is scrutinised by the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Panel, consisting of elected councillors from the police area. The first police and crime commissioner, who was elected on 15 November 2012 and took office on 21 November 2012, was Sue Mountstevens. She had previously been a magistrate and a member of the police authority, and had stood for election as an independent. 
Mountstevens was succeeded by Mark Shelford in May 2021. Then in May 2024, Claire Moody was elected to serve as Avon and Somerset PCC. 

==Organisation==

Avon and Somerset headquarters, which it has shared with Avon Fire and Rescue Service since 2017, is in Portishead in North Somerset, close to the B3124. The site was chosen when the Bristol Constabulary&#x27;s Bridewell Headquarters was deemed to be too small. The Portishead complex cost £31million to construct and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June 1995.
In 2014, the force moved into three new police and custody centres in Bridgwater, Patchway and Keynsham. At that time it announced that a third of its other premises would be closed by 2019.

In 2017, Avon and Somerset moved away from a geographically based policing model to a directorate based one. The current directorates are:

* Response (Patrol, Communications and Detainee Investigations)
* Investigations and Operations Support (including Complex investigations, Criminal Justice and Intelligence)
* Neighbourhood and Partnerships (including Road Safety and Integrated Offender Management)
* Southwest regional Collaborations (Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU), Counter terrorism unit, Forensics)

===Basic Command Unit structure===

Each Basic Command Unit (BCU) has several specialist teams, namely:

* Neighbourhood Policing Teams, each with local beat managers and police community support officers. The teams concentrate on preventing and detecting local crime and targeting offenders, building contacts in the local community, resolving problems by working with local organisations and individuals and being visible and accessible.
* Targeted Patrol Teams responding to emergency calls.
* Traffic units patrol the roads and target and pursue people committing traffic offences, this includes Traffic Police Community Support Officers.
* Criminal Investigation Departments detect serious crime
** Forensic Services investigate crime scenes for forensic evidence that may correspond with many of the Home Office databases.
* Pro-active policing units target persistent criminals and focus on specific operations.
* Dog Units are officers who patrol with dogs and respond to incidents where a police dog is required.

===Headquarters-based teams===
To support the BCUs, several centralised teams operate from the Portishead headquarters:

* Senior Management
* Criminal Investigation Department
* Major Incident Planning
* Major Investigation Team
* Armed Response Group
* Counter Terrorism Group
* Emergency Communications Centre
* Force Contact Centre (SNEN)
* Intelligence
* Corporate communications

===Rank Structure===
Avon and Somerset Police uses the standard rank structure.
===Special Constabulary===
Avon and Somerset Police have a large and active Special Constabulary. Members are warranted (attested) constables, who serve unpaid in various areas of the Force.

&quot;Specials&quot; as they are known, work in the following teams:

* Response Teams (RT)
* Neighborhood Policing Teams (NPT)
* Roads Policing Unit (RPU) (Traffic)
* Attachment to CID

The head is Special Chief Officer Andy Bennett.

The rank structure is as follows:

Avon and Somerset generally do not wear &quot;SC&quot; on their operational uniform rank slides, but all Specials collar numbers start with the digit &quot;5&quot;. 

=== Cadets ===
The force&#x27;s cadets engage at public events, community engagements and meetings with their unit. There are nine cadet units Bath, Bristol Central, Hartcliffe, Patchway, Portishead, Bridgwater, Southmead, Speedwell, and Weston-super-mare.

Police Cadets are young people and are not considered Police Staff or warranted constables.

==Operations==

===National Police Air Service ===
The National Police Air Service (NPAS) is responsible for providing air support to all the police forces of England and Wales. NPAS has a base within the force area adjacent to the Almondsbury M4/M5 Interchange. The helicopter serves all police forces within flying distance. 

===Road Policing Unit===

In 2011 the RPU had 55 cars and 28 motorcycles. The unit has two bases: Almondsbury and Express Park, Bridgwater.

===Support Group Unit===
Avon and Somerset Police has a Support Group that specialise in specific needs of investigations or missions, such as police divers, football match management and explosive searching. The officers chosen for Support Group duties are physically elite and have passed extensive tests.

===Mounted Division Unit===

Although considered a luxury in other forces, Avon and Somerset Police has a division of mounted police due to the many events that attract large crowds in the area such as Badminton Horse Trials, Glastonbury Festival and Bristol City Football Club. The unit consists of 12 bred bay geldings. The unit is occasionally loaned to neighbouring forces as Avon and Somerset and Gloucestershire are the only West Country police forces with a mounted division.

=== Former tri-force collaboration ===
From 2013 to 2019, specialist teams – roads, firearms and police dogs – operated in collaboration with the Gloucestershire and Wiltshire forces.

==Presentation==

===Headgear===
Male police officers and Special Constables (up to and including the rank of Sergeant_ on foot patrol wear the traditional custodian helmet, in the rose style, with a Brunswick star that reads &#x27;Avon and Somerset Constabulary&#x27;. 
A black peaked cap with the black-and-white tartan capband is worn on mobile patrol in vehicles, and a white peaked cap for traffic officers. 

Female police officers and Special Constables have the option of a black bowler hat, or black peaked cap, or a white bowler hat for traffic officers.

Male PCSOs wear a black peaked cap, with a blue sold capband, with female PCSOs having the option of wearing that, or a bowler cap in the same style.

===Uniform===

When on duty, officers wear the black wicking shirt, covered with a black stab vest reading &#x27;Police&#x27; on the front and back. 
Avon and Somerset no longer use the traditional NATO police jumper, having favoured the black jacket with &#x27;Police&#x27; written on the chest and back. Avon and Somerset officers do not have Brunswick stars on their epaulettes, just the rank and/or collar number. 
Officers have a choice of a black (unmarked) fleece, a black inner jacket and a black waterproof coat. There is also a high-visibility bomber jacket, coat and tabbard.

Formal dress comprises an open-necked tunic, white shirt/blouse and tie. Female officers do not wear the black and white chequered cravat. Constables and Sergeants wear custodian helmets and collar numbers on their epaulettes, while higher-ranked officers wear peaked caps, name badges and their rank on their epaulettes. The No.1 uniform is accompanied by black boots or shoes and occasionally black gloves, or brown gloves for the rank of Inspector and above.
===Equipment===

Avon and Somerset Police use a variety of standard UK police equipment including TETRA digital radios, rigid handcuffs, PAVA spray and the ASP collapsible baton. Some officers also routinely carry the TASER Stun device designed to electrically shock a subject making them fall to the ground and to be subdued.

During late 2009 Avon and Somerset Police introduced mobile data terminals and Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) to some of its operational vehicles and front line officers. This is steadily being rolled out across the force. Most front line officers now have their own PDA designed to assist the officer in his/her day to day tasks and allows them to spend more time out of the station.

===Livery===
 Avon and Somerset Police uses the modern blue and yellow retro-reflective square Battenburg markings on all of its operational vehicles. This style of livery was introduced in 2005, when the traditional &#x27;jam sandwich&#x27; style police markings were removed in favour of the new livery, thought to aid officers responding to emergency calls by allowing the public to quickly and clearly identify the vehicle as belonging to the police. The square livery also aids in the visibility of the force, which is perceived to enhance public confidence. Marked vehicles also show the force&#x27;s Internet address on the rear and the word &#x27;POLICE&#x27; across the bonnet. However, the force&#x27;s crest is no longer used on most vehicles.

==Strength and recruitment==
, the force had 2,965 police officers, 299 special constables, and 330 police community support officers, 234 police support volunteers (PSV), and 2,803 staff.

A report has described Avon and Somerset Police as at &#x27;tipping point&#x27; due to financial pressure and increasing work load. The region faces complex threats from Islamism, from right-wing extremists trying to incite anti Muslim hatred and from left-wing extremists. The report states, &quot;We now face a tipping point. We cannot sustain further funding cuts without extremely serious consequences.&quot; There is concern how far the force can protect its population from terrorism. The report expresses concern over management of offenders and over increasing demands due to people with mental health problems. By May 2017, 1,926 registered sexual offenders were in the region. The force manages over 11,000 offenders. Nearly 2,000 &quot;high risk&quot; people, including domestic abusers, violent offenders, sexual offenders, robbers and burglars are not under formal management. Andy Marsh, then chief constable said, &quot;Our continuing ability to safeguard communities, protect the vulnerable, and manage major incidents of this kind is being severely tested. It&#x27;s simply not sustainable. There are serious choices to be made.&quot;

==Performance==

===Complaints===
For the year of 2007/8, the Independent Police Complaints Commission received 800 complaint cases, an increase of 18% from 2006/7, compared to a 0% increase nationally; from this number, 1,231 allegations were made, including &#x27;Other neglect or failure in duty&#x27; and &#x27;Incivility, Impoliteness and Intolerance&#x27;, both at 6% and 3% respectively lower than the national average. Avon and Somerset Police was second-lowest in its peer group of seven other forces.

Of the 1,231 allegations made, 40% were investigated - 8% higher than the national average - 41% were resolved locally, and 19% were withdrawn, dispensed with or discontinued. Of the 40% investigated, 12% were substantiated and 88% were unsubstantiated.

===British Crime Survey===
The British Crime Survey reported that 124,89 crimes were recorded in Avon and Somerset during 2009/10. Nationally recorded crime fell by 9% during this time, including a 22% fall in car crime, a 19% fall in fraud, a 13% fall for robbery and criminal damage. Assault and sex crimes rose by 1%, and &#x27;Other Crimes&#x27;, including public order offences, dangerous driving, possession of firearms, going equipped for stealing, and perverting the course of justice, rose by 26%.

In perceptions of police and crime, 65.2% of residents in Avon and Somerset believed that Avon and Somerset Constabulary was dealing with &#x27;anti-social behaviour and crime that matters&#x27; in their area.

===Official inspections===

For the year of 2009/10, His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMICFRS) rated Avon and Somerset as &#x27;Fair&#x27; in all categories, including &#x27;Local Crime&#x27;, &#x27;Protection from harm&#x27; and &#x27;Satisfaction and Confidence&#x27;. It was recorded as &#x27;Good&#x27; in &#x27;Reducing road death and injury&#x27;, and &#x27;Poor&#x27; in &#x27;Comparative satisfaction of BME [black and minority ethnic] community&#x27;. In value for money, the force received &#x27;Medium/High&#x27; status.

HMICFRS conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Avon and Somerset Police was rated as follows:

==Controversy==

===Race and sex discrimination in recruitment===
In 2006, the force admitted it had contravened the Sex Discrimination Act and Race Relations Act when it deselected 186 white male candidates from its recruitment process solely because of their sex and race. Ralph Welsman, one of those discriminated against, sued the force for their breach of employment laws and he received compensation in an out of court settlement. The policy was condemned by both the Police Federation and Commission for Racial Equality and it was abandoned. The same illegal policy was also used by Gloucestershire Constabulary.

===Taser usage===
In August 2015, officers from the Avon and Somerset force used a Taser on a disabled man, who had the mental age of a seven year old. The man was charged with assaulting an officer, but the case collapsed after defence lawyers provided CCTV of the alleged assault to prosecutors. The police watchdog said that the actions of the officer who failed to gather the CCTV evidence &quot;fell below the standard expected&quot;, but concluded there was no wrongdoing. Campaigners and local politicians argued that the case represented “another incident of excessive and unnecessary” use of the weapon in Bristol. In response to the case, the force appointed a &quot;dedicated lead for autism&quot; and committed to ensuring that all new officers and civilian investigators undergo training covering &quot;autism spectrum conditions and other non-visible disabilities&quot;.

In January 2017, the force referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission following an incident when officers used a Taser on a black community activist who was trying to enter his own home. They mistook him for a wanted person as he persistently refused to give his name to the officers despite requests to do so. The incident was captured on video by a member of the public and by the officers&#x27; own body cameras.
In the subsequent criminal trial of the officer involved, they were acquitted of the allegation of assault and battery (assault by beating) at a trial at Salisbury Magistrates Court. The officer was also later cleared of misconduct by an independent disciplinary panel.

===Death of James Herbert===
The force was criticised over the death in 2010 of James Herbert, who died aged 25 in police care. Herbert, who had mental health issues, was restrained and left wearing a winter coat alone in a hot police van during a 45-minute drive on a hot summer evening. At the police station, Herbert was unresponsive and was put naked into a police cell instead of being taken to hospital. Herbert went into cardiac arrest, and subsequently died. Deborah Coles of the charity Inquest said, &quot;James was detained by the police for his safety. He should have been treated as a patient in need of medical care. Instead, he suffered a traumatic but entirely preventable death involving prolonged and brutal restraint.&quot; The police did not get mental health support for Herbert. In 2017 it was reported that Avon and Somerset police had improved their procedures since the Herbert incident, while other police forces continued with previous practice.

===Bristol protests===

In March 2021, a demonstration against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill splintered, and a group of protestors headed toward Bridewell Police Station in Bristol city centre. The crowd began to attack police officers and the station, where the windows were broken and entry was attempted. Police repelled the mob, but there was further damage to police vehicles, including two vehicles destroyed by fire. This included a male who attempted to set a police van on fire whilst officers were inside the van.

Two further protests the following week were dispersed by police as they were all in contravention of Coronavirus legislation and the crowd refused to move on. The police received support from political leaders across the spectrum, and a member of the public donated a gift to the police in recognition of their work. Other members of the public condemned the violence used by the police against protestors, and the alleged lies told and repeated by the force Twitter account and the Chief Constable, Andy Marsh, regarding non-existent injuries to police officers.

== In media ==
From January 2024, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary series &quot;To Catch a Copper&quot;, showing the work of the force&#x27;s professional standards department. Production company Story Films filmed for four years and covered issues of race, mental health and sexual misconduct in policing. Sarah Crew, chief constable since 2021, said parts of the series had been &quot;uncomfortable&quot; to watch. Incidents in the programme raise questions about use of force and racial profiling. In one case, a constable is fired after publishing revenge porn; in another, an officer is acquitted after having sex on duty with an intoxicated woman.

Crew, with the support of Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Shelford, permitted the programme maker behind-the-scenes access at the police Counter-Corruption Unit. Some members of the Avon and Somerset Police Federation said they felt &quot;utterly betrayed&quot; and &quot;unsupported&quot; by this decision and the resultant program.

<text>James Samuel Emerson VC (3 August 1895 – 6 December 1917) was a British Army officer, and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Emerson was born 3 August 1895 in the village of Collon, County Louth in what is now the Republic of Ireland, to John and Ellen Emerson. When he was 22 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 9th Battalion, The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (Tyrone Volunteers), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 6 December 1917, on the Hindenburg Line north of La Vacquerie, France. He died in action that same day.

==Memorial==
His name is inscribed on the war memorial at the Church of Ireland parish church at Collon, County Louth and on the Cambrai Memorial to the Missing.

<doc id="1219048" wikidata="Q4162534" url="?curid=1219048" title="Short-rate model">
<text>A short-rate model, in the context of interest rate derivatives, is a mathematical model that describes the future evolution of interest rates by describing the future evolution of the short rate, usually written formula_1.

==The short rate==
Under a short rate model, the stochastic state variable is taken to be the instantaneous spot rate. The short rate, formula_1, then, is the (continuously compounded, annualized) interest rate at which an entity can borrow money for an infinitesimally short period of time from time formula_3. Specifying the current short rate does not specify the entire yield curve. However, no-arbitrage arguments show that, under some fairly relaxed technical conditions, if we model the evolution of formula_1 as a stochastic process under a risk-neutral measure formula_5, then the price at time formula_3 of a zero-coupon bond maturing at time formula_7 with a payoff of 1 is given by

:formula_8

where formula_9 is the natural filtration for the process. The interest rates implied by the zero coupon bonds form a yield curve, or more precisely, a zero curve. Thus, specifying a model for the short rate specifies future bond prices. This means that instantaneous forward rates are also specified by the usual formula

:formula_10

Short rate models are often classified as endogenous and exogenous. Endogenous short rate models are short rate models where the term structure of interest rates, or of zero-coupon bond prices formula_11, is an output of the model, so it is &quot;inside the model&quot; (endogenous) and is determined by the model parameters. Exogenous short rate models are models where such term structure is an input, as the model involves some time dependent functions or shifts that allow for inputing a given market term structure, so that the term structure comes from outside (exogenous).

==Particular short-rate models==
Throughout this section formula_12 represents a standard Brownian motion under a risk-neutral probability measure and formula_13 its differential. Where the model is lognormal, a variable formula_14 is assumed to follow an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and formula_1 is assumed to follow formula_16.

===One-factor short-rate models===
Following are the one-factor models, where a single stochastic factor – the short rate – determines the future evolution of all interest rates. 
Other than Rendleman–Bartter and Ho–Lee, which do not capture the mean reversion of interest rates, these models can be thought of as specific cases of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. 
The Vasicek, Rendleman–Bartter and CIR models are endogenous models and have only a finite number of free parameters and so it is not possible to specify these parameter values in such a way that the model coincides with a few observed market prices (&quot;calibration&quot;) of zero coupon bonds or linear products such as forward rate agreements or swaps, typically, or a best fit is done to these linear products to find the endogenous short rate models parameters that are closest to the market prices. This does not allow for fitting options like caps, floors and swaptions as the parameters have been used to fit linear instruments instead. This problem is overcome by allowing the parameters to vary deterministically with time, or by adding a deterministic shift to the endogenous model. 
In this way, exogenous models such as Ho-Lee and subsequent models, can be calibrated to market data, meaning that these can exactly return the price of bonds comprising the yield curve, and the remaining parameters can be used for options calibration. The implementation is usually via a (binomial) short rate tree or simulation; see and Monte Carlo methods for option pricing, although some short rate models have closed form solutions for zero coupon bonds, and even caps or floors, easing the calibration task considerably. 

We list the following endogenous models first. 

#Merton&#x27;s model (1973) explains the short rate as formula_17: where formula_18 is a one-dimensional Brownian motion under the spot martingale measure. In this approach, the short rate follows an arithmetic Brownian motion.
#The Vasicek model (1977) models the short rate as formula_19; it is often written formula_20. The second form is the more common, and makes the parameters interpretation more direct, with the parameter formula_21 being the speed of mean reversion, the parameter formula_22 being the long term mean, and the parameter formula_23 being the instantaneous volatility. In this short rate model an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is used for the short rate. This model allows for negative rates, because the probability distribution of the short rate is Gaussian. Also, this model allows for closed form solutions for the bond price and for bond options and caps/floors, and using Jamshidian&#x27;s trick, one can also get a formula for swaptions. 
#The Rendleman–Bartter model (1980) or Dothan model (1978) explains the short rate as formula_24. In this model the short rate follows a geometric Brownian motion. This model does not have closed form formulas for options and it is not mean reverting. Moreover, it has the problem of an infinite expected bank account after a short time. The same problem will be present in all lognormal short rate models
#The Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model (1985) supposes formula_25, it is often written formula_26. The formula_27 factor precludes (generally) the possibility of negative interest rates. The interpretation of the parameters, in the second formulation, is the same as in the Vasicek model. The Feller condition formula_28 ensures strictly positive short rates. This model follows a Feller square root process and has non-negative rates, and it allows for closed form solutions for the bond price and for bond options and caps/floors, and using Jamshidian&#x27;s trick, one can also obtain a formula for swaptions. Both this model and the Vasicek model are called affine models, because the formula for the continuously compounded spot rate for a finite maturity T at time t is an affine function of formula_29. 

We now list a number of exogenous short rate models. 
#The Ho–Lee model (1986) models the short rate as formula_30. The parameter formula_31 allows for the initial term structure of interest rates or bond prices to be an input of the model. This model follows again an arithmetic Brownian motion with time dependent deterministic drift parameter. 
#The Hull–White model (1990)—also called the extended Vasicek model—posits formula_32. In many presentations one or more of the parameters formula_33 and formula_23 are not time-dependent. The distribution of the short rate is normal, and the model allows for negative rates. The model with constant formula_35 and formula_23 is the most commonly used and it allows for closed form solutions for bond prices, bond options, caps and floors, and swaptions through Jamshidian&#x27;s trick. This model allows for an exact calibration of the initial term structure of interest rates through the time dependent function formula_31. Lattice-based implementation for Bermudan swaptions and for products without analytical formulas is usually trinomial.
# The Black–Derman–Toy model (1990) has formula_38 for time-dependent short rate volatility and formula_39 otherwise; the model is lognormal. The model has no closed form formulas for options. Also, as all lognormal models, it suffers from the issue of explosion of the expected bank account in finite time.
#The Black–Karasinski model (1991), which is lognormal, has formula_40. The model may be seen as the lognormal application of Hull–White; its lattice-based implementation is similarly trinomial (binomial requiring varying time-steps). The model has no closed form solutions, and even basic calibration to the initial term structure has to be done with numerical methods to generate the zero coupon bond prices. This model too suffers of the issue of explosion of the expected bank account in finite time.
#The Kalotay–Williams–Fabozzi model (1993) has the short rate as formula_41, a lognormal analogue to the Ho–Lee model, and a special case of the Black–Derman–Toy model. This approach is effectively similar to &quot;the original Salomon Brothers model&quot; (1987), also a lognormal variant on Ho-Lee.
# The CIR++ model, introduced and studied in detail by Brigo and Mercurio in 2001, and formulated also earlier by Scott (1995) used the CIR model but instead of introducing time dependent parameters in the dynamics, it adds an external shift. The model is formulated as formula_42 where formula_43 is a deterministic shift. The shift can be used to absorb the market term structure and make the model fully consistent with this. This model preserves the analytical tractability of the basic CIR model, allowing for closed form solutions for bonds and all linear products, and options such as caps, floor and swaptions through Jamshidian&#x27;s trick. The model allows for maintaining positive rates if the shift is constrained to be positive, or allows for negative rates if the shift is allowed to go negative. It has been applied often in credit risk too, for credit default swap and swaptions, in this original version or with jumps. 

The idea of a deterministic shift can be applied also to other models that have desirable properties in their endogenous form. For example, one could apply the shift formula_43 to the Vasicek model, but due to linearity of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, this is equivalent to making formula_22 a time dependent function, and would thus coincide with the Hull-White model.

===Multi-factor short-rate models===
Besides the above one-factor models, there are also multi-factor models of the short rate, among them the best known are the Longstaff and Schwartz two factor model and the Chen three factor model (also called &quot;stochastic mean and stochastic volatility model&quot;). Note that for the purposes of risk management, &quot;to create realistic interest rate simulations&quot;, these multi-factor short-rate models are sometimes preferred over One-factor models, as they produce scenarios which are, in general, better &quot;consistent with actual yield curve movements&quot;.
* The Longstaff–Schwartz model (1992) supposes the short rate dynamics are given by

:: formula_46
: where the short rate is defined as
:: formula_47
* The Chen model (1996) which has a stochastic mean and volatility of the short rate, is given by
:: formula_48
* The two-factor Hull-White or G2++ models are models that have been used due to their tractability. These models are summarized and shown to be equivalent in Brigo and Mercurio (2006). This model is based on adding two possibly correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Vasicek) processes plus a shift to obtain the short rate. This model allows for exact calibration of the term structure, semi-closed form solutions for options, control of the volatility term structure for instantaneous forward rates through the correlation parameter, and especially for negative rates, which has become important as rates turned negative in financial markets. 
==Other interest rate models==
The other major framework for interest rate modelling is the Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework (HJM). Unlike the short rate models described above, this class of models is generally non-Markovian. This makes general HJM models computationally intractable for most purposes. The great advantage of HJM models is that they give an analytical description of the entire yield curve, rather than just the short rate. For some purposes (e.g., valuation of mortgage backed securities), this can be a big simplification. The Cox–Ingersoll–Ross and Hull–White models in one or more dimensions can both be straightforwardly expressed in the HJM framework. Other short rate models do not have any simple dual HJM representation.

The HJM framework with multiple sources of randomness, including as it does the Brace–Gatarek–Musiela model and market models, is often preferred for models of higher dimension.

Models based on Fischer Black&#x27;s shadow rate are used when interest rates approach the zero lower bound.

<text>Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra is a four-issue comic book mini-series published by Marvel Comics written by Greg Rucka with art by Salvador Larroca. Marvel characters Daredevil and Elektra are introduced to the Ultimate universe in the series in October 2002. A sequel to the series called Ultimate Elektra was released in August 2004.

==Plot==
In this story, Matt Murdock and Elektra Natchios are both students in Columbia University, where they meet and start dating. Murdock is blind and studying law. During the course of the story, Elektra and her roommates are harassed by a rich boy, Trey Langstrom, until Elektra, a martial artist fights back. In response, Langstrom and a group of thugs destroys Elektra&#x27;s father&#x27;s business. Murdock, also a martial artist and possessor of enhanced senses (which compensate for his blindness), forces the thugs to confess, but couldn&#x27;t stop Elektra from seriously wounding Langstrom. While Matt reveals his identity to Elektra, she forces him to choose between their love and his sense of duty. He chooses the second and they apparently part ways.

==Reception==
The first issue Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra was ranked 13 with pre-order sales of 77,050.

<text>Gabriel Georges Coury VC (13 June 1896 – 2 February 1956), was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years==
Born on 13 June 1896 in Liverpool, (then part of Lancashire), to an Armenian-Lebanese father and a French mother, Coury was educated at Stonyhurst College from 1907 to 1913. He worked as an apprentice in a cotton brokerage when World War I broke out. Coury volunteered to join Kitchener&#x27;s Army in 1914.

==Victoria Cross==

While Coury was a second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, The South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers) (attached to the 1/4th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment, the pioneer battalion of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division), he performed deeds on 8 August 1916, near Arrow Head Copse, France, for which he was awarded the VC. His actions also earned him a promotion to full lieutenant.

===Citation===

===Royal Flying Corps===
On 15 November 1916, Coury was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps as a flying officer (observer). He was appointed a flying officer on 20 September 1917, although his seniority was dated from 28 August 1917.

On 1 April 1918, Coury was transferred to the Royal Air Force on its establishment, and he subsequently transferred to the RAF Administrative Branch on 20 September 1918. On 30 September 1918, Coury was promoted to temporary captain in the Medical section of the Administrative Branch. He mustered out as a captain when the war ended.

===Post war===
After the war, Coury returned to his old firm as a cotton broker. When the Second World War broke out, he joined the Royal Army Service Corps and participated in the Normandy Landings.

==Personal life==
Coury married Katherine &#x27;Kitty&#x27; Mary Christina (née Lovell) on 7 January 1918 in St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Clapham, London. Katherine was a volunteer with a medical/welfare group during the First World War.

The couple had three daughters: Joan Marie Louise Coury, Carmen Katherine Mary Coury and Margaret Mary Coury.

==Legacy==
Coury is honoured in a memorial at his former school, St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College, Liverpool. His VC is on display at the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment Museum at Fulwood Barracks in Preston, Lancashire. Coury also attended Stonyhurst College in Lancashire and a platoon of the Stonyhurst CCF is named in his honour. In addition, his portrait hangs alongside the other six Stonyhurst VCs in the Top Refectory.

<text>Raymond James Houghton (born 9 January 1962) is a former professional footballer and current sports analyst and commentator with RTÉ Sport.

As a player, he was a midfielder, notably playing for Liverpool where he won two First Division titles and a two FA Cups before switching to Aston Villa ahead of the inaugural Premier League season. He also briefly played top flight football for both West Ham United and Crystal Palace with spells in the Football League for Fulham, Oxford United and Reading, before retiring with non-league Stevenage Borough.

Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Houghton played international football for the Republic of Ireland, for which he qualified through his Irish father. Houghton is particularly remembered by Irish fans for scoring two of the most important goals in the national team&#x27;s history, which resulted in 1–0 victories over England in Stuttgart at the 1988 European Championship, and Italy at Giants Stadium at the 1994 World Cup.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Houghton was born in Castlemilk, Glasgow (where Arthur Graham, who would also become an international footballer, was an upstairs neighbour in the same tenement block), but began his professional career in London at West Ham United, after moving to London at the age of 10, where he came through the ranks and signed professional forms as a 17-year-old on 5 July 1979. Houghton&#x27;s endeavour failed to make any impact at Upton Park and after 3 years, in which he made just one appearance as substitute, he was on the move. On 7 July 1982 he moved on to Fulham on a free transfer.

===Fulham===

Malcolm Macdonald had Tony Gale (later a Premier League title winner with Blackburn Rovers), Paul Parker (who went on to win several major trophies with Manchester United), Gerry Peyton (Republic of Ireland international goalkeeper) and Ray Lewington (ex-Chelsea) to form a mixture of youth and experience which ultimately won Fulham promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1981–82 season. He then added Houghton to the side that would try to keep the Cottagers in the second division. They did, and comfortably so; in fact for much of the 1982–83 season it looked as though Fulham would achieve back-to-back promotions, however, their form after the turn of the year dipped. One of the most memorable sequences of matches that happened whilst Houghton was at Fulham was the League Cup third round tie against Liverpool in 1983. The first game finished 1–1 at Craven Cottage as did the replay at Anfield, Fulham then won the toss to take the second replay back to the Cottage. Many observers believe Fulham had done enough to have beaten the reigning cup holders but had let the Reds off the hook with their failure to put away the chances they created. Liverpool won the game 1–0 with a 25-yard thunderbolt from Graeme Souness.

In May 1985, he made a guest appearance for Manchester United in Peter Foley&#x27;s testimonial.

===Oxford United===
Jim Smith had taken Oxford United to the top tier of English football. When he left in 1985, his replacement, Maurice Evans, looked to Houghton to help solidify their place in the league. He paid £147,000 for Houghton on 13 September 1985. Houghton had played 145 times for Fulham and scored 21 goals. He made his U&#x27;s debut the day after he signed, in a 2–2 draw with Liverpool at the Manor Ground. By the end of his first season, Houghton had helped to steer Oxford clear of the relegation places, just staying up with a win on the final day of the season, but most notably scored the second goal in the club&#x27;s 3–0 League Cup final victory over Smith&#x27;s new team Queens Park Rangers at Wembley.

===Liverpool===
At the start of the 1987–88 season, Oxford were beaten 2–0 by Liverpool, who then offered £825,000 for his services. The deal was done and Houghton took the place of Craig Johnston on the right side of Liverpool&#x27;s midfield, unusually wearing the No. 9 shirt which striker John Aldridge, his former Oxford teammate who had made the Anfield move himself a year earlier, had asked not to wear because of the pressure of replacing Ian Rush.

Houghton was added to the new acquisitions of Aldridge, Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to form one of the most exciting forward lines in the club&#x27;s history. He made his Reds debut on 24 October 1987 in the 1–0 league victory over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. His first goal for the club came on 4 November 1987 in the 1–1 draw with Wimbledon at Plough Lane. Houghton&#x27;s 62nd-minute strike came just two minutes after he had come on as a sub for Johnston. It also kept up Liverpool&#x27;s run of 29 unbeaten league matches from the start of the season.

Liverpool went on to coast to the League title, with Houghton contributing some memorable displays as a marauding creator from the flank. He scored his share of goals too, including the first goal in the era-defining 5–0 win over Nottingham Forest, which was later described by some journalists as the &quot;match of the century&quot; and was complimented by the game&#x27;s greats such as Tom Finney.

Houghton did his bit in the run to that season&#x27;s FA Cup final too, scoring the winner in a fifth round derby at Everton and then clipping home a shot on the turn as Liverpool romped past Manchester City 4–0 in the quarter-finals. In the final, Liverpool surprisingly lost to Wimbledon and missed out on the &quot;double&quot;.

The following season, Houghton was again a regular as Liverpool battled towards another League and FA Cup &quot;double&quot;, though they again would be denied. More important matters than football affected Houghton and his teammates in April 1989 however, as the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April claimed 94 lives (with the death toll eventually reaching 97). Upon returning to the game Liverpool went on to win the Cup with a 3–2 extra-time victory over Everton but lost the League title with virtually the last kick of the season in the title decider at Anfield against Arsenal.

The following year Houghton and Liverpool regained the title when they finished 9 points ahead of Aston Villa, although Houghton managed just 19 out of 38 league appearances in the 1989–90 season and scored just once.

Houghton played 32 times in the 1990–91 season, scoring seven goals, as Liverpool finished second in the League to Arsenal. He picked up another FA Cup winners&#x27; medal with Liverpool in the 1991–92 season and also had his best return in goals during his time at Anfield, finishing as the club second highest goalscorer with 12 goals, only bettered by Dean Saunders. However, Souness allowed Houghton to leave at the end of the season, partly due to the emergence of Steve McManaman.

After 202 appearances and 38 goals in his 5 successful years at Liverpool Houghton joined Aston Villa for £900,000.

===Aston Villa===
Ray Houghton joined Aston Villa at the start of the 1992-93 season. Villa manager Ron Atkinson had to fend off attempts by manager Ian Porterfield to bring Houghton Chelsea. Houghton made his debut on 15 August 1992 in the 1–1 draw with Ipswich Town at Portman Road, Villa&#x27;s first game in the new FA Premier League.

Houghton again won the fans over with his robust style and helped Villa win the League Cup on 27 March 1994, although he was an unused sub for a Villa side who defeated Manchester United 3–1. This would be the only trophy that he won during his time at Villa. He did come close to collecting another title medal in his first season at Villa Park, as Villa had led the league at several stages of the campaign, but were eventually pushed into runners-up place by Manchester United, who were crowned champions by a 10-point margin.

Houghton played a total of 117 times for Villa, scoring 11 goals.

===Crystal Palace===
On 23 March 1995 (transfer deadline day) Houghton left Villa to join Crystal Palace. Palace paid £300,000 for the player hoping that his experience would help Palace stave off relegation from the Premier League and progress in the FA Cup, but they were relegated (despite finishing fourth from bottom as the division was being reduced to 20 clubs) and eliminated at the semi-final stage in the respective competitions.

Houghton made his Palace debut, as a 33-year-old, on 1 April 1995 in the 2–1 win over Manchester City at Selhurst Park. One of Houghton&#x27;s best performances for the South London club was on 28 September 1996 in the 6–1 thrashing of Southend United in a Division One fixture at Selhurst Park. Houghton was at the heart of everything Palace did, and scored a goal in the 38th minute. He spent just over two years at Palace, playing 87 times and scoring 8 goals.

===Reading===
Houghton signed for Reading on a free transfer on 15 July 1997. He made his debut the following month on 9 August in the 1–1 league draw with Bury at Gigg Lane.

He spent a season at Elm Park and another at Reading&#x27;s new home, the Madejski Stadium, which saw him rack up 56 appearances in which he scored just once, against Manchester City. Reading would be Houghton&#x27;s last professional club, he had played 723 times during his career scoring 93 goals.

===Stevenage Borough===
Houghton wound his career down at Stevenage Borough in the Conference. He signed for Stevenage on 24 September 1999 but only made three appearances before he retired from the game on 31 May 2000.

==International career==
Prior to his career with the Republic of Ireland, Houghton was a member of a Scotland U18 squad under Andy Roxburgh, failing to gain any caps. Despite becoming increasingly successful in his club career by 1986, he was not considered for the Scotland squad for the upcoming World Cup.

Houghton qualified to play international football for the Republic of Ireland through his father, who was born in Buncrana in Inishowen, County Donegal, in Ulster. He earned his first cap in Jack Charlton&#x27;s first match as manager, a 1–0 defeat by Wales in a friendly international at Lansdowne Road on 26 March 1986.

In the summer of 1988, Houghton was selected for the Irish squad which had reached its first ever major finals, the European Championships in West Germany. The first group game on 12 June was against an England team that included Gary Lineker, Bryan Robson and Houghton&#x27;s Liverpool club mates Peter Beardsley and John Barnes. Houghton scored with an early looping header to win the game 1–0, his first goal for Ireland. Ireland failed to get through the group stage after a draw against the USSR and a defeat against eventual champions The Netherlands.

Houghton was selected for the Irish squad which qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. They were once again drawn in the same group as England, which included Lineker, Robson, Beardsley and Barnes as well as Paul Gascoigne and Chris Waddle. The game finished in a 1–1 draw. The Irish also drew with both Egypt, 0–0, and the Netherlands, 1–1, finishing on the same points (3), goal difference (0), and goals scored (2) as the Dutch. Both teams progressed to the second round, along with England who topped the group.

On 25 June Ireland faced Romania at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in Genoa. Following a hard earned 0–0 draw, the game went to penalties with Houghton scoring the second penalty kick to help Ireland win 5–4 and qualify for the quarter-finals. Ireland were defeated 1–0 by the host nation Italy in a closely fought match.

Houghton was selected in the Irish squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States and was once again the goalscoring hero in a shock victory. In the 11th minute of the group E match at Giants Stadium on 18 June Houghton hit a looping shot into the net to defeat Italy, gaining revenge for the defeat Ireland had suffered at the hands of the Italians four years earlier. Ireland were knocked out of the tournament at the next stage by the Netherlands.

Houghton&#x27;s final appearance was as a substitute in the 1998 FIFA World Cup play-off match with Belgium in Brussels. Ireland lost the match 2–1 (3–2 on aggregate) with Houghton scoring his final international goal. He had represented Ireland 73 times scoring 6 goals.

Houghton has now taken up post as an ambassador for the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).

In 2008, Houghton was part of the three-man team along with Don Givens and Don Howe appointed to head-hunt the new international manager. After interviewing several candidates, Houghton and the team ultimately nominated Giovanni Trapattoni to the FAI.

==Media career==
Houghton now works as a pundit on the game, working for outlets such as RTÉ in Ireland, and talkSPORT, Sky Sports, Sportsxchange in the UK and LFC TV. Since 2002 he has also worked for Sports Interactive as a consultant on their game Football Manager.

In 2005, he was given an honorary degree by the University of Huddersfield, for his services to sport. He joined actor Tim Brooke Taylor and former Olympic swimmer Adrian Moorhouse in collecting degrees.

He contributed to RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
He was also part of RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as a co-commentator, and of UEFA Euro 2016 and UEFA Euro 2020.

<text>Eilert Lund Sundt (8 August 1817 – 13 June 1875) was a Norwegian theologist and sociologist, known for his work on mortality, marriage and other subjects among the working class. He was an early pioneer of the field of sociology in Norway.

==Early and personal life==
He was born in Farsund as a son of Lars Mortensen Sundt (1762–1850) and Karen Bing Drejer (1777–1865). He was a distant descendant of Peter Drejer. He was a third cousin of Christian Sundt, uncle of Lauritz and Karen Sundt, granduncle of Vigleik, Halfdan and Harald Sundt, and great-granduncle of Leif Sundt Rode.

His father was a ship captain, and he was born into a large family of 13 children. All the children worked to help make ends meet. Farsund at that time had many seamen, small fishermen and chandlers. This provided his initial exposure to the ideas which he came to examine extensively later in his life: poverty, overpopulation and the work issues associated with the transition from an older farm culture to 19th century business and industry.

In February 1859 he married Nicoline Conradine Hansen (1822–81), a daughter of Maurits Christopher Hansen. They had the son Einar Sundt, a publisher.

==Career==
In 1835 he began his studies in Kristiania, but came back to Farsund in 1838 and became a teacher. He resumed his studies in Kristiania in 1841. There he met and became close friends with Henrik Wergeland, who was also born and raised in Agder. When Henrik Wergeland was buried in 1845, Eilert Sundt led the student contingent and spoke at the funeral on their behalf.

His interests in sociology were broad. He studied prison conditions, customs and treatment of Gypsies, causes of death, the evils of married life in Norway, conditions of prostitutes, suicide, fishery and forestry workers&#x27; living and working conditions, building customs, shipping practices, household cleanliness and administration of poverty laws. A man of his times, he also was interested in ethnography, ethnology, vernacular architecture, demography, and linguistics (with special emphasis on the dialects of Norwegian).

From 1857 to 1866 Eilert Sundt was editor for &quot;Folkevennen&quot; (&quot;Friend of the People&quot;), for which he wrote a number of the more important articles. His work served to inform many of the authors of Norwegian literature in their transition to a socially aware realism at the close of the 19th century.

Eilert Sundt served as the parish priest in Eidsvoll from 1869, and he died there in 1875.

Two of his works were selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009–2011.

<text>PEO, the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (, ), is an umbrella organization for trade unions in Cyprus, which evolved from PSE (). It was instrumental in the 1948 strikes in the mines of the Cyprus Mines Corporation and has been closely related to AKEL.

==History==
When AKEL was declared illegal by the British colonial government of Cyprus in 1955, PEO and especially its leader Andreas Ziartides was the only legal leftwing political entity and it was expressing the politics of underground AKEL.

PEO had a membership from all ethnic groups in Cyprus. In 1958 the Turkish Cypriot nationalistic organisation TMT launched a terror campaign against Turkish Cypriot members of PEO, killing the journalist Fazıl Önder and attempting to kill the head of PEO&#x27;s Turkish bureau, Ahmet Sadi. Following those events, most Turkish Cypriots left the union, and PEO&#x27;s members since then have primarily been Greek Cypriots. The PEO is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions.

<text>Bedfordshire Police is the territorial police force responsible for policing the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire in England, which includes the unitary authorities of Bedford, Central Bedfordshire and Luton. Its headquarters are in the town of Kempston in Bedford Borough.

, the force has 1,317 police officers, 151 special constables, and 1,084 staff.
It covers an area of ,
with a population of 665,000.

==History==
A professional police force was established in Bedfordshire in 1839, under the County Police Act 1839, replacing the earlier system of elected parish constables. It initially comprised a chief constable, who was based in Ampthill, 6 superintendents and 40 constables. Constables were paid 19 shillings a week, which was nearly twice the typical wage of an agricultural labourer in the county at that time.

There was an independent Luton Borough Police from 1876 to 1947, and then from 1964 to 1966, when it amalgamated with Bedfordshire Constabulary, which was then known as the Bedfordshire and Luton Constabulary until 1974. In 1965, Bedfordshire Constabulary had an establishment of 497 and an actual strength of 430.

On 11 June 2007, PC Jon Henry, was fatally stabbed whilst on duty in the town centre of Luton by a Nigerian immigrant, Tennyson Obih. Obih was convicted of his murder, along with the attempted murder and wounding with intent of two other men that he stabbed on the same morning.

==Structure==
Bedfordshire Police has collaborated in the formation of several specialist units with Hertfordshire Constabulary and Cambridgeshire Constabulary including Major Crime, Dogs, Firearms and Roads Policing.

The force also leads regional units including Eastern Region Special Operations Unit and Eastern Counter Terrorism Intelligence Unit with forces in Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex.

In June 2015, the force implemented a new operating model – which comprises north and south bases and aims to increase the number of warranted officers in local communities.

==Initiatives==
Bedfordshire Police publish results of cases on their official website, such as a drug gang who were jailed for 39 years.

In 2014, Bedfordshire Police allowed cameras into the force 24/7 to film a fly-on-the-wall documentary, &quot;24 Hours in Police Custody&quot;, capturing some of the issues faced by police officers today. The last series ended in June 2016, but more episodes are planned for the near future.

In July 2015, Bedfordshire Police was the first force in the country to secure a female genital mutilation (FGM) protection order. The court order allowed officers to seize the passports of two young girls who it was thought were being taken to Africa.

In 2016, Bedfordshire Police&#x27;s cadets scooped a national award for their outstanding contribution to helping to reduce crime and creating a safer community.

==Resources==
The force&#x27;s 202122 budget was set at £127.4million.
Previously, in 2017, funding pressures meant that Bedfordshire Police had considered not responding to some low level crimes. Kathryn Holloway stated that the force has made almost £35M in cuts and would face further cuts of £11.4M to £12.5M over the coming four years &quot;if things remain unchanged&quot;.

, the force has 1,317 police officers, 151 special constables, and 46 police community support officers (PCSO), 20 police support volunteers (PSV), and 1,084 staff.

==Governance==
The first Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner was Olly Martins, who was elected on 15 November 2012 and took office on 21 November 2012. The performance of the police and crime commissioner (PCC) is scrutinised by the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Panel, made up of elected councillors from the local authorities in the police area, and two independent members. Before November 2012 the Bedfordshire Police Authority was the police governance. On 5 May 2016, Kathryn Holloway became the second PCC, after winning the vote against Olly Martins and other candidates.
Festus Akinbusoye was elected PCC in May 2021 election. Akinbusoye assumed office on Thursday 13 May 2021

The &quot;Our Force&quot; control strategy determines operational priorities, helping Bedfordshire Police to protect people and fight crime.

==PEEL inspection==
His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Bedfordshire Police was rated as follows:

<doc id="1219073" wikidata="Q1371532" url="?curid=1219073" title="Peretz Smolenskin">
<text>Peretz (Peter) Smolenskin (; 25 February 1842 – 1 February 1885) was a Russian-born Zionist and Hebrew writer.

== Biography ==
Peretz Smolenskin was born in Monastyrshchina, Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Smolensk Oblast, Russia). His family came from Smolensk. His older brother was seized by the Czar&#x27;s army and never returned. His father, falsely accused of a crime, was a fugitive for over two years and died when Peretz was eleven. At the age of 12, he left home to study at yeshiva for five years. He began reading secular books and learning Russian under the influence of the Haskalah movement.

Smolenskin traveled through southern Russia and the Crimea, supporting himself by singing in choirs and preaching in synagogues. In 1862 he settled in Odessa where he studied music and languages and taught Hebrew. He published his first story in 1867. In the course of his travels through Romania, Germany and Bohemia, he acquired Turkish nationality.

==Literary career==
In Vienna, Smolenskin founded &quot;HaShachar&quot; (&quot;The Dawn&quot;), a Hebrew journal that became a literary platform for the Haskalah movement and early Jewish nationalism. He also wrote novels and short stories in Hebrew.

He was stricken with tuberculosis in 1883 and died on February 1, 1885, in Merano, Italy. He completed his last novel, &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, shortly before his death.

Smolenskin was a leader in the revolt of young Jews against medievalism and a strong voice for Jewish nationalism. His Hebrew periodical, &quot;The Dawn&quot; (&quot;Ha-shahar&quot; השחר), was highly influential in these spheres. Shortly before his death he was associated with Laurence Oliphant and became deeply interested in the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Smolenskin was among the first of the Jewish nationalists to disassociate Messianic ideals from theological concomitants.

==Published works==
His six novels create a kaleidoscope of Jewish life in which he rejects the notion of the westernized Jew.

<doc id="1219075" wikidata="Q5919381" url="?curid=1219075" title="Howard Craufurd Elphinstone">
<text>Major General Sir Howard Craufurd Elphinstone, (12 December 1829 – 8 March 1890) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early career and the Crimean War==
Born in Livonia, Elphinstone joined the Corps of Royal Engineers as a gentleman cadet at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in December 1847. With the outbreak of the Crimean War, Elphinstone was posted to the Crimea and it was during the Siege of Sebastopol that he won the Victoria Cross.

===Victoria Cross===
On 18 June 1855, he was 25 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.
His citation read:
===Further honours===
With the end of the war he was decorated by both Napoleon III, Emperor of France being appointed as a Knight of the Legion of Honour; and Abdülmecid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire who appointed him to the 5th class of the Order of the Medjidie.

==Subsequent career==
Elphinstone ended the Crimean War as a brevet major and as a substantive second captain in the Royal Engineers, but was promoted to the substantive Army (but not Corps) rank of major in 1858.

In 1859 he joined the Royal Household of Queen Victoria as governor to Prince Arthur, the third son of Queen Victoria, and later also governor to Prince Leopold, Her Majesty&#x27;s fourth son. In 1865 the Queen rewarded him for his service as governor by appointing him as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (Civil Division). In 1868 he was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel and in 1870 he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

Further honours came Elphinstone&#x27;s way when Prince Arthur obtained his majority in 1871, firstly in May he was appointed Comptroller of the Household to Prince Arthur, the same month he was made a Companion of the Military Division of Order of the Bath, and finally in July was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Civil Division of the Order of the Bath.

He married Annie Frances Cole (1856–1938) and they settled at Pinewood, Bagshot, close to Prince Arthur&#x27;s home at Bagshot Park. Lady Elphinstone lived at Pinewood until her death in 1938. They had four daughters: Victoria (1877–1952); Irene (1878–1957), Olive (1882–1968) and Mary (1888–1965). All four married army officers. Mary married Colonel Robert Singleton McClintock, son of Francis Leopold McClintock.

Promotions also followed; in 1872 his substantive promotion to major was confirmed and the following year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

Returning to military service Elphinstone served as an Aide-de-camp to the Queen in 1877 and was promoted to colonel at the end of 1881, and was appointed as Officer Commanding Royal Engineers in Mauritius, a post he was reluctant to take up, so much so that he was prepared to resign from the army; however under customs then allowed in the British Army, a posting could be avoided if another officer was prepared to take the posting instead. Normally this involved payment to the substitute officer but Elphinstone was fortunate to meet fellow Royal Engineer officer, Colonel Charles Gordon who was willing to take the posting to Mauritius without payment. During 1884–5 he served as military attache in Berlin. In 1887 he was promoted to major general and in 1889 he became General Officer Commanding Western District but he drowned in 1890 when he fell overboard while on a trip to Madeira.

==Memorial==

There is a brass plaque to his honour in the Nave of Exeter Cathedral. It names the people who attended Elphinstone&#x27;s memorial service in the cathedral – a large number were royalty and Queen Victoria sent a representative. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1219082" wikidata="Q966451" url="?curid=1219082" title="Filesystem in Userspace">
<text>Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a bridge to the actual kernel interfaces.

FUSE is available for Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD (as puffs), OpenSolaris, Minix 3, macOS, and Windows.

FUSE is free software originally released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License.

== History ==
The FUSE system was originally part of &quot;AVFS&quot; (&quot;A Virtual Filesystem&quot;), a filesystem implementation heavily influenced by the translator concept of the GNU Hurd. It superseded Linux Userland Filesystem, and provided a translational interface using in libfuse1.

FUSE was originally released under the terms of the GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License, later also reimplemented as part of the FreeBSD base system and released under the terms of Simplified BSD license. An ISC-licensed re-implementation by Sylvestre Gallon was released in March 2013, and incorporated into OpenBSD in June 2013.

FUSE was merged into the mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14.

The userspace side of FUSE, the library, generally followed the pace of Linux kernel development while maintaining &quot;best effort&quot; compatibility with BSD descendants. This is possible because the kernel FUSE reports its own &quot;feature levels&quot;, or versions. The exception is the FUSE fork for macOS, OSXFUSE, which has too many differences for sharing a library. A break in libfuse history is libfuse3, which includes some incompatible improvements in the interface and performance, compared to the older libfuse2 now under maintenance mode.

As the kernel-userspace protocol of FUSE is versioned and public, a programmer can choose to use a different piece of code in place of and still communicate with the kernel&#x27;s FUSE facilities. On the other hand, and its many ports provide a portable high-level interface that may be implemented on a system without a &quot;FUSE&quot; facility.

== Operation and usage ==

To implement a new file system, a handler program linked to the supplied codice_1 library needs to be written. The main purpose of this program is to specify how the file system is to respond to read/write/stat requests. The program is also used to mount the new file system. At the time the file system is mounted, the handler is registered with the kernel. If a user now issues read/write/stat requests for this newly mounted file system, the kernel forwards these IO-requests to the handler and then sends the handler&#x27;s response back to the user.

FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike traditional file systems that essentially work with data on mass storage, virtual filesystems don&#x27;t actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing file system or storage device.

In principle, any resource available to a FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system.

== Applications ==

=== On-disk file systems ===
Conventional on-disk file systems can be implemented in user space with FUSE, e.g. for compatibility or licensing reasons.

*Linear Tape File System: Allows files stored on magnetic tape to be accessed in a similar fashion to those on disk or removable flash drives.
*NTFS-3G and Captive NTFS, allowing access to NTFS filesystems.
*retro-fuse: retro-fuse is a user-space filesystem that provides a way to mount filesystems created by ancient Unix systems on modern OSes. The current version of retro-fuse supports mounting filesystems created by Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Edition of Research Unix from Bell Labs, as well as 2.9BSD and 2.11BSD based systems.

=== Layering file systems ===
FUSE filesystems can create a view of an underlying file system, transforming the files in some way.

*EncFS: Encrypted virtual filesystem
* FuseCompress, gzipfs, Fuse-ZIP, CompFUSEd: Compressed virtual filesystems
* Archive filesystems may also perform this task

=== Archive and backup file systems ===
FUSE filesystems can expose the contents of archives or backup sets without having to first extract them.

*archivemount
*Atlas (Rubrik backup software): Immutable, distributed filesystem used by Rubrik Cloud Data Management data protection applications
*Borg (backup software): Deduplicating backup program that allows backup archives to be mounted as FUSE filesystems.
*Restic: Free, fast, efficient and secure backup software uses FUSE to be able to browse all of your backup snapshots as a regular file system
*SPFS A file system for Spectrum Protect, designed to mount the backup server filespace anywhere on your server, and use the features included from the backup server (encryption, de-duplication, compression, filtering etc). This is a WORM file system.

=== Remote/distributed file system clients ===
*CernVM-FS: A distributed read-only software distribution system, implemented as a POSIX filesystem in user space (FUSE) using HTTP transport, to deliver software in a fast and reliable fashion at global scale.
*CloudStore (formerly, Kosmos filesystem): By mounting via FUSE, existing Linux utilities can interact with CloudStore
*ExpanDrive: A commercial filesystem implementing SFTP/FTP/S3/Swift using FUSE
*FTPFS
*GlusterFS: Clustered Distributed Filesystem having ability to scale up to several petabytes.
*goofys: A FUSE filesystem that allows access to Amazon S3/Microsoft Azure storage with an emphasis on performance.
*google-drive-ocamlfuse is a FUSE filesystem for Google Drive, written in OCaml. It lets you mount your Google Drive on Linux.
*IPFS: A peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files.
*JuiceFS: A distributed POSIX file system built on top of Redis and S3.
*KBFS: A distributed filesystem with end-to-end encryption and a global namespace based on Keybase.io service that uses FUSE to create cryptographically secure file mounts.
*Lustre Cluster filesystem will use FUSE to allow it to run in userspace, so that a FreeBSD port is possible. However, the ZFS-Linux port of Lustre will be running ZFS&#x27;s DMU (Data Management Unit) in userspace.
*MinFS: MinFS is a fuse driver for Amazon S3 compatible object storage server. MinFS lets you mount a remote bucket (from a S3 compatible object store), as if it were a local directory.
*MooseFS: An open source distributed fault-tolerant file system available on every OS with FUSE implementation (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenSolaris, OS X), able to store petabytes of data spread over several servers visible as one resource.
*Nexfs: A commercial Linux file system that combines Block, File, and S3 compatible Cloud &amp; Object storage into a single pool of POSIX compatible storage.
*ObjectiveFS: Distributed filesystem with object store backend (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage or S3-compatible object store) using FUSE
*Rclone can mount a variety of remote / cloud storage with FUSE.
*s3fs: Gives the ability to mount an S3 bucket as if it were a local file system.
*Sector File System: Sector is a distributed file system designed for large amount of commodity computers. Sector uses FUSE to provide a mountable local file system interface.
*SSHFS: Provides access to a remote filesystem through SSH.
*Transmit: A commercial FTP client that also adds the ability to mount WebDAV, SFTP, FTP and Amazon S3 servers as disks in Finder, via MacFUSE.

*IndexFS: A remote file aggregating filesystem with transparent CURL access to distributed files.

=== Other ===

*GVfs: The virtual filesystem for the GNOME desktop
*rvault: A secure and authenticated store for secrets and small documents using envelope encryption with one-time password (OTP) authentication. It uses FUSE to expose the vault as a file system.
*EaseFilter-Cloud-File-System: A Windows cloud file system for developers in user space, to implement the load balancing and cloud-based disaster recovery.

<doc id="1219088" wikidata="Q4962118" url="?curid=1219088" title="Brett Cloutman">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel His Honour Sir Brett Mackay Cloutman, VC, MC, QC (7 November 1891 – 15 August 1971) was a British Army officer, barrister, and Official Referee of the Supreme Court. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Background ==
Brett Cloutman was educated at Berkhamsted School, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford College and London University where he was a member of the Royal Engineers contingent of the university&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Training Corps.

== Military career ==
At the outbreak of World War I Cloutman enlisted as a Rifleman in the Rangers (12th Battalion, London Regiment), reached the rank of Lance-Corporal, and in 1915 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Kent (Fortress) Engineers, a Territorial Force unit.

=== Military Cross ===
Cloutman, by then Acting Major in command of the 59th Field Company, Royal Engineers, was awarded the Military Cross for an action in September 1918:
For conspicuous gallantly and devotion to duty at Banteux on the morning of 30th September, 1918, when he made a personal reconnaissance under heavy machine-gun fire to ascertain the possibilities of bridging the Canal de L&#x27;Escaut.

=== Victoria Cross ===
A few weeks later the action took place for which Cloutman won his VC. The official citation read:
The bridge had been prepared for demolition by the Germans, and was well defended. By cutting the wires, Cloutman prevented the enemy from blowing it up at the time. He was seen at the bridge, however, and escaped under an intense fire from its guards. The fact that the abutments were not destroyed later meant that the bridge could be more quickly replaced by the Allies.

This was the last act to win a VC in the First World War.

==Legal career==
After the war Cloutman became a lawyer and was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1926. In World War II he served again in the Royal Engineers and received a mention in despatches. He became a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1946 and in 1947 he was appointed Senior Chairman of the War Pensions Tribunal. He was Senior Official Referee of the Supreme Court of Judicature (now the Senior Courts of England and Wales) 1954–63. Having become Senior Official Referee, he was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1957. He was Master of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers 1939–40 and 1965–66.

Following his death in 1971, his ashes were interred at Norfolk Cemetery, in the Somme department, in the grave of his brother, an officer of No. 178 Tunnelling Company who was killed on 22 August 1915. 

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Chatham, Kent.

<text>Edmund Besley Court Kennedy J. P. (5 September 1818 – December 1848) was an explorer in Australia in the mid nineteenth century. He was the Assistant-Surveyor of New South Wales, working with Sir Thomas Mitchell. Kennedy explored the interior of Queensland and northern New South Wales, including the Thomson River, the Barcoo River, Cooper Creek, and Cape York Peninsula. He died in December 1848 after being speared by Aboriginal Australians in far north Queensland near Cape York.

==Early life==
Kennedy was born on 5 September 1818 on Guernsey in the Channel Islands to Colonel Thomas Kennedy (British Army) and Mary Ann (Smith) Kennedy. He was the sixth born of nine children, comprising five boys and four girls.

Kennedy was educated at Elizabeth College Guernsey, and expressed an early interest in surveying. In 1837 he went to Rio de Janeiro, returning to England in 1838 when the business house in which he worked closed down. A naval officer friend of the family, Captain Charles James Tyers, suggested that if Kennedy obtained the necessary qualifications, he would arrange employment for him in Australia. During 1839 Kennedy attended lectures in surveying at King&#x27;s College London, obtaining a certificate from his tutor.

In November 1839 Kennedy sailed for Sydney in the barque &quot;Globe&quot; which arrived in March 1840. Another family contact Captain Perry, who was deputy to Sir Thomas Mitchell, arranged a position for Kennedy as assistant surveyor in the New South Wales Survey Department after he had passed an examination. In August Kennedy was assigned to join Tyers on an overland journey to Melbourne, thence to Portland Bay for survey duties.

Whilst there, he had a liaison with an Irish convict girl named Margaret Murphy. She became pregnant which caused a minor scandal and Kennedy sent her off in a ship to Launceston with £50. Kennedy&#x27;s indiscretion was reported to Superintendent Charles La Trobe and Governor Gipps and he was recalled to Sydney in May 1843 in disgrace. Murphy later gave birth to their daughter Eliza, remarried and moved back to Ireland. The daughter died at age five. Kennedy received praise from Mitchell for his work in Portland and remained employed in the government surveying department in Sydney, but at half-pay.

==First expedition==

In 1845, Mitchell received authority from London for an expedition from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria terminating at Port Essington. He was convinced that a major river must run in a north-westerly direction to the gulf, and that he would be the one to discover it. His initial choice for second in command was the surveyor Townsend, but shortly before setting off, Edmund Kennedy was appointed to replace him. On 5 November Kennedy was sworn in as a Justice of the Peace at the Supreme Court, and the expedition set off from Sydney in mid November. The party trekked via Parramatta and Bathurst to a rendezvous point at Boree. Kennedy in a letter to his father noted that the party consisted of 30 men, 12 months supplies plus &quot;8 drays, 3 carts, 102 bullocks, 255 sheep, [and]17 horses.&quot; The large size of the expedition was to be detrimental to the rate of progress.

Mitchell tracked north along the Bogan River, east to the Macquarie, north to the Narran, then along the Balonne. Here Mitchell found a natural rocky causeway and named it St George Bridge, near the present town of St George, Queensland. To allow time for stock to refresh, he left Kennedy at a depot camp for three weeks, thereafter to follow slowly while Mitchell probed northwards with a small party. Mitchell continued to follow the Balonne, which took him too far north-east, so he veered west until coming across the Maranoa River where Kennedy and the main party caught up on 1 June 1846. By now Mitchell realised that their equipment was a cumbersome impediment to progress, so he decided to leave Kennedy behind again, near the present town of Mitchell. He was gone for four and a half months.

Initially Mitchell followed the Maranoa to its headwaters, and entered an area of hills which left him perplexed. At least four streams, the Nogoa, Belyando, Nive and Nivelle were traced to determine their direction of flow, but none trended north-west, and much time was employed in so doing. He left yet another party behind and travelled north-west with only a native guide and two men. Finally he discovered a substantial river which seemed to flow towards the gulf, so he named the river Victoria, after the British Sovereign. Mitchell had reached the limit of his supplies, and was forced to turn back. The two smaller teams rejoined and returned to Kennedy&#x27;s depot on 19 October. The expedition then beat a retreat to Sydney, arriving 20 January 1847.

==Second expedition==

Mitchell was impressed with the leadership qualities of Kennedy, as demonstrated by his management of the depot camps in 1846, and his technical skills relating to survey and exploration. As the question of a great north-west river remained unanswered, Mitchell gained approval in February 1847 for a new expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria, with the express purpose of plotting the course of his Victoria River en route. This time he placed Kennedy in charge of a party of eight, which set off from Windsor, New South Wales 21 March 1847.

His instructions were to travel via St. George Bridge (14 May) to the Maranoa (8 June) where his earlier depot had been, then determine the course of the Victoria. Kennedy had spent some time plotting Mitchell&#x27;s Victoria river on the latest map of the colony, and was struck by the fact that its general course turned towards a bend of Cooper Creek, named by Charles Sturt in 1845. The expedition continued northward over what was now new territory for Kennedy, and by mid August was in the vicinity from which Mitchell had been forced to return. Kennedy decided to conceal the carts and supplies from local aborigines by digging a large trench in which to bury them, then proceeded by packhorse.

The river began turning towards the south-west, taking them away from the gulf. Scouting ahead he found a substantial tributary joining the Victoria from the north, and named it the Thomson River in honour of the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Edward Deas Thomson. The country began to deteriorate and by early September Kennedy was forced to retreat to his hidden cache because of lack of water and supplies. The river by this time showed no sign of turning towards the gulf, but looked as though it would run into the Cooper. Kennedy&#x27;s plan altered then to split the party and make a dash for the gulf.

When a buried cart was opened at the cache however, it was found to have been tampered with by natives and a great deal of the supplies had been destroyed. This left the expedition with no alternative but to retreat to Sydney. On the homeward journey, Kennedy followed the course of the Warrego River (discovered by Mitchell in 1846), until its course took him too far west, splitting into many channels. He then headed east, intercepted the Culgoa River, and returned to Sydney 7 February 1848. It was later proved that the Victoria did flow into Cooper Creek, thus it was renamed Barcoo River, an Aboriginal name for the river that Kennedy had learnt.

Gregory reported that the Upper Burdekin area was very suitable for squatting, given the extensive country and its abundant water, advising that settlement would of necessity require the use of force since the indigenous peoples were amply supplied with food and water which would enable them to resist resolutely any settlement on their lands.

==Third expedition==

The Government&#x27;s plan for Kennedy&#x27;s next journey was primarily to find a way to the gulf, to be followed by exploration of Cape York Peninsula. The importance of Port Essington (the only port in northern Australia at the time) had declined, but trade along the east coast between Sydney and Singapore had increased, which prompted Captain Owen Stanley of to recommend that the east coast of Cape York be explored first. He further suggested that after a resupply of the party at the tip of the cape, the exploration could continue down the west coast, with a subsequent return overland to Sydney. It was anticipated that eighteen months would be required to complete the trip. This idea was accepted, and planning began for Kennedy to head for a starting point at Rockingham Bay, near the present town of Cardwell, Queensland.

On 28 April 1848 Edmund Kennedy and twelve men sailed from Sydney Harbour in the barque &quot;Tam O&#x27; Shanter&quot; escorted by &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. They arrived at Rockingham Bay 20 May, but once they had landed, the party encountered terrible terrain such as mangrove swamps, mountains, lagoons, rivers, and thick rainforest that made it almost impossible to travel with horses, carts, and sheep. After nine weeks, they had travelled just 40 miles from the coast, and 12 miles north of the landing point. Kennedy had to abandon the carts and some supplies in a hopeless bog. Further on, the storeman was found to have stolen food from the supplies, and was demoted to labourer. The party was due to rendezvous at Princess Charlotte Bay with the supply ship &quot;Bramble&quot; in early August, but this did not occur as the party was two months late, and in any case there was no close approach for &quot;Bramble&quot;.

===Death===
By mid November, the men and horses began to weaken, so the decision was taken to leave eight men behind at Weymouth Bay, while Kennedy and four others continued north. There were still several hundred miles to go to a rendezvous point with the ship &quot;Ariel&quot;, before any hope of a rescue was possible. Days after crossing the Pascoe River, when in the vicinity of Shelburne Bay, Costigan accidentally shot himself while tending his horse and could not continue, so Luff and Dunn were left behind to care for him. They were never seen again. Kennedy and his aboriginal tracker Jackey Jackey pressed on towards Port Albany and the rendezvous, but they were closely followed by local indigenous peoples. Near the banks of the Escape River, 20 miles from the tip of Cape York, Kennedy was speared several times and died in Jackey Jackey&#x27;s arms. From existing reports it seems that Kennedy&#x27;s death resulted from attacks that seem &quot;not to have been directly provoked&quot;. After a feat of endurance of about ten days with no supplies, Jackey Jackey made it to the supply ship alone 23 December 1848.

Following directions from Jackey Jackey, &quot;Ariel&quot; proceeded to Shelburne Bay, and sent a search party ashore. A few relics were found, but no sign of the three men. The ship continued to Weymouth Bay where William Carron and William Goddard were found to be the only survivors of the eight men left there. &quot;Ariel&quot; with its three surviving expeditioners returned to Sydney in May 1849.

==Views on Aboriginal Australians==
During his life and career in Australia, Kennedy maintained an overtly negative view of the Indigenous people, writing that:
&quot;I sincerely trust they will soon be exterminated...they are a barbarous set of rascals never to be tamed.&quot;
He later elaborated that:
&quot;I feel convinced that nothing can be done towards civilizing the adults. The children might be made anything of by removing them to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land...might not the second or third generation improve by cultivation? Towards reconciling the natives to our occupation of their land much might be done by distributing tomahawks and blankets...I feel sure however that the native adults are too far behind in the scale of civilization to derive any benefit from religious instruction.&quot;

==Legacy==
The following were named in his honour:

* The former Electoral district of Kennedy in the Queensland Legislative Assembly and the Division of Kennedy in the Parliament of Australia are named after Kennedy.
*Edmund Kennedy National Park – established 1977; subsumed into Girramay National Park in 2009.
*Kennedy Highway
*Kennedy, Queensland, a locality in the Cassowary Coast Region

In 1852, a marble memorial to Kennedy and Jackey Jackey was erected in St James&#x27; Church in Sydney. The memorial depicts Kennedy dying in Jackey Jackey&#x27;s arms.

=== Centenary of the expedition ===
The centenary of the expedition was commemorated in 1948.

In May 1948, a monument to Kennedy was erected in Cardwell.

On 25 September 1948 a monument to Kennedy was erected at Cooktown.

On 11 November 1948 a monument to Kennedy was erected at Portland Road (Weymouth Bay) in Iron Range in Queensland near a spring where the expedition drew water.

The Kennedy Memorial Monument was unveiled on 13 December 1948 in Somerset, Queensland in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Kennedy&#x27;s unsuccessful exploration of Cape York Peninsula. The monument comprises a concrete slab on a concrete footing with a bronze commemorative plaque on its eastern face.

In addition, bronze plaques were placed in Charleville, Kennedy, Tully and Escape River.

<text>Cambridgeshire Constabulary is the local territorial police force that covers the county of Cambridgeshire and the Peterborough district of the ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire administered by the unitary authority of Peterborough City Council. It provides law enforcement and security for an area of and population of 856,000 people, in a predominantly rural county. The force of Cambridgeshire includes the cities of Cambridge, Ely and Peterborough, the market towns of Chatteris, Huntingdon, March, Ramsey, St Ives, St Neots, Whittlesey, and town and Port of Wisbech. Its emblem is a crowned Brunswick star containing the heraldic badge of Cambridgeshire County Council. 
According to a government report in July 2018 on policing numbers, the force consists of 1,383 police officers (giving the county a ratio of 163 officers per 100,000 people), 111 police community support officers and 778 members of staff. Together with 229 special constables and 84 police support volunteers. It had a budget in for the year of 2018 of £134 million, of which £78.4 million (58.5%) came directly as an annual grant from the Home Office and the rest from local council taxes.

The chief constable is Nick Dean. The force is overseen by the Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC).

== History &amp; background ==
=== Beginnings ===
The origins of Cambridgeshire Constabulary date back to 1836, when the first police force within what are now the current boundaries of the force area was set up in the city of Cambridge under the name Cambridge Borough Police. This was followed in 1841 by establishment of the Isle of Ely Constabulary, covering the city of Ely, as well as Chatteris and March.

Cambridgeshire County Constabulary was formed in 1851 to police those rural parts of the county outside the jurisdiction of the Cambridge Borough Police. The boroughs of Huntingdonshire and Wisbech and city of Peterborough did not start their own police forces until 1857, under the County and Borough Police Act 1856, which required each borough to have its own local police force. Wisbech Borough Police came under the authority of the Isle of Ely Constabulary in 1889. In 1949, the two forces that covered the city of Peterborough; the Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary and the Peterborough City Police merged to form Peterborough Combined Police. Cambridge Borough Police was renamed Cambridge City Police in 1951. 

=== Mid-Anglia Constabulary to Cambridgshire Constabulary ===
In 1965, all five forces that exist in the Cambridgeshire area (Cambridge City Police, Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Isle of Ely Constabulary, Huntingdonshire Constabulary, and Peterborough Combined Police) amalgamated to form the new Mid-Anglia Constabulary. The force was renamed Cambridgeshire Constabulary in 1974, when the new non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire was created by the Local Government Act 1972 with identical boundaries to the Mid-Anglia Constabulary area.

In 2001 the constabulary conducted one of Peterborough&#x27;s biggest police enquiries following the racist murder of teenager Ross Parker.

2002 saw the Soham murders, an event that led to the biggest investigation in the history of Cambridgeshire police and one of the most expensive in the country, costing £3.5million.

=== Past and current collaboration ===
In March 2006, as part review on policing nationally the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke proposed the creation of an East Anglian force merging Cambridgeshire with Norfolk and Suffolk. While Norfolk and Cambridgeshire supported it, Suffolk would have preferred to have Eastern Coastal force with Norfolk and Essex. Essex on the other hand wanted to stay alone. However, these proposes were scrapped after a cabinet reshuffle with John Reid as the new Home Secretary.

Since 2010, the force has been collaborating with Bedfordshire Police and Hertfordshire Constabulary to form a mid-Anglia &quot;triforce&quot; with various departments collaborating to make local efficiencies with resources. Areas that have been collaborated include Human Resources, Information Technology, Major Crime Unit, Dog Unit, Tactical Firearms Unit, Information Management Unit, Tickets and Collisions Office, Road Policing Unit, Scenes of Crime and Procurement.

There is also collaboration on a seven-force function with the adjacent forces of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent with serious incident, counter terrorism and intelligence under the regional organised crime unit, the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU). Vehicle procurement is done in association with Thames Valley Police, British Transport Police and Civil Nuclear Constabulary as well as Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire under the Chiltern Transport Consortium.

===Officers killed in the line of duty===

The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers.

The following officers of Cambridgeshire Constabulary were killed while they were on duty, or returning to / from duty:
==Operations==
The head of the constabulary is Chief Constable Nick Dean, a former assistant chief constable of Norfolk Constabulary who came into the role as chief constable in October 2018. His deputies are head of investigations Deputy Chief Constable Jane Gyford, formerly a commander of the City of London Police and head of operations Assistant Chief Constable Vicki Evans, previously the Assistant Chief Constable of Dyfed-Powys Police. One notable former chief constable is the current Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, Julie Spence OBE QPM, who was chief constable from 2005 to 2010.

The constabulary headquarters is based in the Huntingdon suburb of Hinchingbrooke, which is home to the force executive board, information management and the force control room. The constabulary also works together with eleven police stations throughout the local policing area. They are: Cambridge (known simply as Parkside, after the street it is based on), Histon, Sawston, Ely, Cambourne, St Ives, Huntingdon town, St Neots, March, Wisbech, Hampton and Peterborough (known as Thorpe Wood, after the local nature park). It has a local police training facility in the parish of Abbots Ripton, near Alconbury (known as Monks Wood, after the local national nature reserve).

In local policing management, the force area is subdivided into two areas (also called divisions) and are known simply as North and South. Northern local policing headquartered at Thorpe Wood, covers the city of Peterborough and the district of Fenland. Southern local policing is headquartered at Parkside, and it covers the districts of Cambridge City, South Cambridgeshire, East Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire.

==Governance==
Prior to 2012, Cambridgeshire Constabulary was overseen by a police authority that comprised 17 members. This was made up of nine district councillors, of which seven were nominated by Cambridgeshire County Council and two by Peterborough City Council, three magistrates, nominated by the county&#x27;s magistrates&#x27; courts committee; and five independent members, chosen from the community. However, In 2011 the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 was passed by Parliament which abolished Police Authorities in favour of an elected police and crime commissioner (PCC). On 15 November 2012, elections took place in England and Wales to elect a PCC for each Police Area. In Cambridgeshire, the winning candidate was Conservative Sir Graham Bright, former MP for Luton. The Cambridgeshire PCC is scrutinised by the Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Panel, made up of elected councillors from the local authorities in the police area.

==PEEL inspection==
His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Cambridgeshire Constabulary was rated as follows:

== In popular culture ==
In 2019, the constabulary was involved in the Channel 4 reality programme &quot;Famous and Fighting Crime&quot; where five personalities Penny Lancaster, Jamie Laing, Katie Piper, Sandi Bogle and Marcus Brigstocke acted as special constables for the force.

<doc id="1219094" wikidata="Q6422462" url="?curid=1219094" title="Knights of Pendragon">
<text>The Knights of Pendragon are a fictional team of heroes featuring in comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters appeared in two series published by imprint Marvel UK between 1990 and 1993. The first incarnation was written by Dan Abnett and John Tomlinson, with art by Gary Erskine. The series featured a mixture of new and extant characters, and takes place in the shared Marvel Universe.

==Creation and publication history==
===First series===
&quot;The Knights of Pendragon&quot; was Marvel UK&#x27;s third attempt at producing an American-format &#x27;book length&#x27; comic series, following &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Claws&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot;. Whereas those titles had been science fiction-based action-adventure series, &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot; was a highly political and environmental comic, its themes borrowing heavily from British folklore and the growing New Age and neopagan subcultures. Heavy reference was made to &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, a 14th-century chivalric romance. The series was also influenced by growing coverage of environmental activist groups such as Greenpeace; as a result the comic itself was printed on Scangloss, an environmentally friendly paper stock that used half the trees and minimum whitening bleach. The series was Gary Erskine&#x27;s first ongoing series, following a short story in Marvel UK&#x27;s anthology &quot;Strip&quot;.

The series featured extant British-based characters including former &quot;Captain Britain&quot; supporting character Dai Thomas and Union Jack, a costumed hero originally created by Roy Thomas and Frank Robbins for &quot;The Invaders&quot;, as well as new creations. It also featured appearances by Captain Britain himself and the Weird Happenings Organisation, both then featuring in the popular American &quot;Excalibur&quot; series. Promotional adverts featured art by Alan Davis and prominently featured Captain Britain, leading to some complaints when the character&#x27;s role was more peripheral. Davis himself would later criticise the portrayal of Captain Britain in the series. Union Jack&#x27;s costume was redesigned to play down similarities between his costume and apparel worn by right-wing groups such as the National Front.

Davis was initially planned to do the series&#x27; covers, but after being misinformed about the front page graphic layout withdrew after completing the first five, feeling it was making his work look bad. Instead, a variety of prominent British artists contributed – including Simon Bisley, Mark Farmer, John Bolton, Doug Braithwaite, Colin MacNeil, Dermot Power and Liam Sharp. Initial sales were reportedly strong, leading to the initial planned six issue limited series being extended to an ongoing title. In the title&#x27;s letters page, &quot;Pendragon to Paper&quot;, editor Steve White noted the title had received criticism it was attempting to &quot;batter [the] readers into an ecological submission with saturation attacks each issue&quot;. The series received limited distribution in America.

Later issues featured guest appearances by several prominent Marvel superhero characters including Iron Man, the Black Panther, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. As noted ruefully by the publication&#x27;s own letters pages, these appearances were not reciprocated by Marvel UK&#x27;s parent companies beyond a sideways reference in the pages of &quot;Excalibur&quot;. The series lasted 18 issues – eight more than &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Claws&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Head&quot; – before finally being cancelled in December 1991.

===Collected editions===
Plans to collect the first six issues in a trade paperback while the series was still running ultimately failed to come to fruition. In 2009 Panini Comics, owner of Marvel UK since the company&#x27;s mid-1990s collapse, issued the first nine issues in a trade in 2009. The rest of the series would be uncollected until 2020, when Marvel issued an oversized omnibus collecting both series of the title.

===Second series===
Partway through the first series Paul Neary took over from Ian Rimmer as Marvel UK editorial director (effectively the imprint&#x27;s editor-in-chief). He planned an aggressive tilt at the lucrative American market, and rapidly commissioned a slew of American-format titles, material from which would be featured in anthology &quot;Overkill&quot; for the domestic market. John Freeman pitched a follow-up called &quot;Armageddon Knights&quot; in late 1993, but never received a response; the story, which featured Grace and Union Jack, would have wrapped up loose-ends from the preceding series. Instead, Neary instigated a different revival of &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot;, initially called (and occasionally referred to for clarity in later material as) &quot;Pendragon II&quot;. Neary liked the concept of the original series but felt it had lost focus as it progressed. He commissioned original writers Abnett and Tomlinson to make a sequel that made the theme reborn Arthurian heroes more explicit and consistent, while retaining the ecological themes. The new series began in summer 1992.

Erskine was moved over to another new title, &quot;Warheads&quot;, with Phil Gascoine and Adolfo Buylla the initial art team. The characters were redesigned by Alan Davis to fit the aesthetic Neary was aiming for, while the editor directed the series to tie in with the overarching Mys-Tech plot linking the new Marvel UK series. Like several Marvel UK titles of the period the series crossed over with other Marvel UK titles, including &quot;Warheads&quot; and &quot;Death&#x27;s Head II&quot;, and also featured guest appearances from the parent company&#x27;s big hitters – with Iron Man in the first four issues, and later Spider-Man. However, like most of the Marvel UK series, the latter went unacknowledged by the American series for the most part, though the characters did feature in a one-off strip in anthology &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #122 – written by Skip Dietz and drawn by Hoang Nguyen rather than the usual creative team, and some of the team were used in Davis&#x27; take on the Days of Future Past storyline in &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

The series ended abruptly in 1993 after 15 issues after the summer collapse of the comic market led to mass cancellations of Marvel UK titles.

===Later appearances===

==Fictional history==
The team was formed to be agents of the Green Knight, an aspect of the Green Man; a mystical entity representing the natural cycle and spiritual growth. The Knight is in ageless conflict with the Bane, an unnatural destructive force of warfare and winter. The Green Knight invests power, in the form of a possessing spirit bestowing powers, to various groups throughout British history, to protect nature; one such group were the original Knights of the Round Table; the Knights of Pendragon are a modern-day incarnation.

Widowed Scotland Yard inspector Dai Thomas, a sometime antagonist and more recently ally of Captain Britain, is contacted by the W.H.O. (Weird Happenings Organisation) to solve a series of gruesome murders of ecologically based criminals (corrupt farmers, ivory hunters, exotic bird smugglers, and so on). He is soon joined by satellite TV reporter Kate McClellan. Soon both become obsessed with fighting the criminals themselves, and after a series of visions, Dai becomes superhumanly strong and battle-savvy, taking on the aspect of Gawain. The crimes share a common factor – the sinister multinational Omni Corporation, owned by the Bane-controlled Francesca Grace. As Thomas&#x27; investigation becomes messier and draws negative attention to Omni, Grace initially assigns heavy Dolph to kill the pair. When he fails, Grace leans on her government connections to have the WHO remove Thomas from the case. He ignores them, so Grace arranges for the British government to send Captain Britain to retrieve the apparently insane Thomas from a cut-down section of the Amazon Rainforest, they instead fight, and Britain kills Thomas. However, Thomas and the Captain were possessed by the spirits of Gawain and Lancelot respectively from the time of King Arthur; as such the Captain was destined to kill Thomas in accordance to Arthurian lore, and Thomas is then resurrected. The three of them travel to the Green Knight&#x27;s citadel, whilst Thomas/Gawain recounts the Green Knight&#x27;s poem, a pact between man and nature:

Man had forgotten that pact, and so the Knight was lashing out in pain. Gawain sacrifices his Pendragon power to partially heal the Knight, and also to spark the creation of another Pendragon group.

Thomas&#x27; next assignment is to find the identity of vicious, misogynistic serial killer The Jigsaw Man, who is butchering successful women in London. After conferring with Kate and Brian Braddock, they realise the killer is Dolph. Their investigation is side-tracked when Kate&#x27;s son Cam is imbued with the spirit of the Pendragon and goes missing from his boarding school in Wiltshire. One of the masters at the school is Peter Hunter, a former avatar of the Pendragon himself and secretly the World War I-era patriotic superhero Albion, who aids the search; another ally is the vigilante Joe Chapman, also known as Union Jack. Formerly an unpowered crime-fighter, he has also come under the influence of the Pendragon and contacts Kate searching for answers. Kate discovers she is also gaining powers when she comes under attack from Dolph, but Cam is found by Grace and falls under the influence of Grace. Meanwhile, bestselling author Ben Gallagher is also imbued with the Pendragon after coming across a brutal whale culling while in Orkney. Dai meanwhile is hospitalised when Cam leads a mission to free Dolph from police custody. After an abortive raid on Omni, the current Pendragons – Peter, Kate, Ben and Joe – pool their resources, and realise Grace plans to use a deal with Stark Industries to manifest the Red Knight in Joselito, Spain. However, the Green Knight appears instead, but is little match for the power of the Bane. With the aid of Iron Man, the group are able to keep the Bane at bay long enough for Peter to reach Cam and draw the Pendragon from the boy into himself. Cam returns to normal, and in gratitude Tony Stark funds the group to build a headquarters in Chapman&#x27;s Cameliard Farm base.

Kate and Ben begin a relationship, much to the chagrin of the jealous Joe, while Grace and the Bane continue their attacks. The Omni Corporation targets Hippopotami near the Congo River in Wakanda, an atrocity that also draws the attention of the Black Panther, fitting new anti-poaching detection units with the help of Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. Forewarned by visions, Ben, Joe and Kate are in the area investigating, while Peter researches the Bane in Bonn. After stopping the ivory thieves, Union Jack and the Black Panther follow a lead to Hong Kong, while Kate and Ben head to Australia to follow another. However, neither mission goes well – in Kowloon the Black Panther is critically injured and Union Jack is killed by a horribly mutated Dolph, while Ben is mortally injured by another of the Bane&#x27;s avatars. Albion meanwhile is captured by Grace and used as a sacrifice to manifest the Red Lord. In anticipation, the Green Knight gathers Pendragons from all through time at the Green Chapel, resurrecting Ben, Joe and Peter in the process. Among the others called are the Black Panther, Captain Britain, Iron Man, Dai and Little John, as well as Adam Crown – a young man possessed by the spirit of King Arthur. In the resulting battle the Red Lord and his forces are driven back and Adam purges the Bane from Grace, though the cost is high and Ben is among those killed.

Grace&#x27;s conversion and subsequent membership in the Knights of Pendragon attracts the attention of Omni&#x27;s owners, Mys-Tech. While Grace, Adam and Peter explore the Green Chapel in Avalon, Union Jack comes under attack from malfunctioning robots at Questworld, a new Arthurian theme park in Darkmoor. The robot facsimile of Gawain at the park, meanwhile, becomes the vessel for the spirit of Gawain himself. As Questworld features robotics from Stark Industries, Union Jack calls in Iron Man to assist. Afterwards, Union Jack convenes with the other Pendragons, who have found powerful armour in the Green Chapel. The rampaging Gawain robot is tracked by the Black Knight, observed by Mys-Tech agent Magpie and journalist Jane Breeze. When they try to seize the robot the Pendragons and Iron Man intervene, and Gawain joins the team – while Jane explains she had been duped by Mys-Tech. The group convenes at the Green Chapel. Meanwhile, a man called Iain Guthrie is tricked into triggering a nuclear leak at Cape Wrath by the Bane; following Jane&#x27;s visions the Pendragons arrive and Gawain is able to talk Guthrie into not triggering a full meltdown.

Breeze joins the group. The Pendragons respond to a call for help from the world of Arakne, being attacked by the Warheads. Envoy Arrakyl took the Pendragons to the Gossamer Tower where they found the world&#x27;s Spider-God resembled Spider-Man, who was under attack from Malekyth. The group were ultimately able to persuade Liger, Misha and Stacy of the Warheads that their attack on Arakne was wrong, and Malekyth was driven off. The Pendragons also battled Shadow Wing, one of the Bane, foiling his plans to complete a devastating spell known as the Seeds of Winter.

Mys-Tech stepped up their campaign against the team by allying with Union Jack&#x27;s old enemy Baron Blood. Grace feigned returning to the service of the Bane and pretended to lure Union Jack to the Omni Corporation tower as a human sacrifice. However, once he arrived the pair worked together to defeat the vampire. Next Mys-Tech used the Un-Earth to poison the Green Knight, causing chaos in London via the monster Skire, who Adam was eventually able to defeat. With the aid of Death&#x27;s Head, Wolverine, Dark Angel, Doctor Strange and Professor X the Pendragons were able to prevent Un-Earth from activating.

The Pendragons&#x27; work on Arakne had inadvertently damaged Earth-313, and the Lemurians of that world hired Death&#x27;s Head to kill them in return. The biomechanoid attacked the Green Chapel, briefly allying with Magpie, but eventually realised he had been misled. Death&#x27;s Head destroyed Magpie and the Pendragons were able to foil another attempt to manifest the Red Lord before aiding the people of Earth-313 in repairing the damage they had done.

When the alien Skrulls invaded Avalon the Green Knight was decapitated by a Super-Skrull and the Pendragon Force was briefly controlled by the Skrulls and redistributed to empower the Skrull soldiers attacking London. With the failure of their invasion, the Green Knight was restored and the Skrulls lost control of the Pendragon Force.

The Pendragons were part of the final battle against Mys-Tech. Years later, Dai, Kate, Union Jack, an elderly Albion, and new ally Pete Wisdom united to stop Omni-Corporation from digging up an old Mys-Tech base in the Lake District. The base contained perverted zombie clones of the original Round Table (complete with &quot;Zombie Excalibur&quot;) who wanted to slaughter and return Britain to a distorted Dark Ages, and sent a defeated Albion to Psycho-Wraith Prime. Wisdom turned the tide by reawakening the Green Knight in a new form, representing the best of modern Britain. Albion was used as part of a portal to bring Mephisto&#x27;s Hell to Earth but the Knights helped stop it. Afterwards, the team disbanded again.

==Collected editions==
==Reception==
Alan Stewart&#x27;s Arthurian comic guide Camelot in 4 Colors felt the first series was &quot;one of the most intriguing and original Arthurian comics series that has yet appeared&quot;, but that the second was much less successful as it strove to be &quot;a more conventional (and commercial) superhero team comic book&quot;. In a retrospective review for Now Read This, Win Wiacek described the collection of the first nine issues as &quot;a pivotal moment in British mainstream comics&quot;.

Comic Book Resources listed the Pendragons as one of &#x27;10 Marvel Teams Built Around Magic&#x27;.

<text>George William Chafer VC (16 April 1894 – 1 March 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 22 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, The East Yorkshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 3/4 June 1916 east of Méaulte, Somme, France, during a very heavy bombardment and attack on our trenches, a man carrying an important written message to his commanding officer was half buried and rendered unconscious by a shell. Private Chafer, at once grasping the situation, on his own initiative, took the message from the man&#x27;s pocket and, although severely wounded, choking and blinded by gas, ran along the ruined parapet under heavy shell and machine-gun fire. He just succeeded in delivering the message before he collapsed from the effects of his wounds.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire Museum, 3 Tower Street, York, England.

<text>Major-General The Hon. Sir Henry Hugh Clifford, (12 September 1826 – 12 April 1883) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Clifford was the third son of Hugh Clifford, 7th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh by his marriage with Mary Lucy, only daughter of Thomas (afterwards Cardinal) Weld of Lulworth Castle, Dorsetshire. He was born on 12 September 1826 and received his first commission as a second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade, on 7 August 1846.

Clifford served in South Africa against the Gaikas under Sandili in the following year, and then against the Boers until their submission at Weinberg on the Vaal river. On the outbreak of another Kaffir war in 1852 he again went to Africa, where he remained until November 1853.

Clifford took part in the Crimean war, where he received the appointment of aide-de-camp to Sir George Brown, commanding the light division, and was present at Alma and Inkerman, and for his gallantry in the latter battle was decorated with the Victoria Cross, by leading one of the charges, killing one of the enemy with his sword, disabling another and saving the life of a soldier (5 November 1854).

In May 1855, Clifford was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general, and remaining in the Crimea until the conclusion of the war was then promoted to the rank of brevet major, and received the medal and clasps for Alma, Inkerman, and Sebastopol, and from foreign governments the Legion of Honour and the 5th class of the Medjidie.

==Later career==
On the outbreak of hostilities in China Clifford sailed thither, and as assistant quartermaster-general was present at the operations between December 1857 and January 1858 which resulted in the capture of Canton. For his services he received the brevet of lieutenant-colonel, with the China medal and Canton clasp.

On his return to England, Clifford commenced a long term of service on the staff; he was assistant quartermaster-general at Aldershot 1860–4, held a similar appointment at headquarters 1865–1868, was aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief 1870–3, and assistant adjutant-general at headquarters 1873–5. Early in 1879, Clifford was selected to proceed to South Africa to take charge of the communications of Lord Chelmsford between Durban and the forces in the field. His task was no light one, for great confusion prevailed at Durban, the port of disembarkation; but by his great experience in staff duties, his knowledge of the requirements of the supply of an army, and, above all, by his familiarity with native warfare and his indefatigable nature, he very soon reduced everything to order, and his labours were fully acknowledged by Sir Garnet Wolseley.

Clifford was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1869, and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 19 December 1879, and was granted a pension of £100 for distinguished services on 7 October 1874. He served as General Officer Commanding Eastern District of England from April to September 1882. He died at Ugbrooke, near Chudleigh in Devon on 12 April 1883.

==Family==
Clifford married, 21 March 1857 in Dublin, Josephine Elizabeth, the only surviving child of Joseph Anstice of Madeley Wood, Shropshire, a professor at King&#x27;s College London. A son was the colonial administrator Sir Hugh Clifford. Another son was Brigadier-General Henry Frederick Hugh Clifford, who was killed in action during the First World War. Lady Clifford died in 1913 at Hampton Court Palace presumably as grace and favour of her husband&#x27;s service.

<text>Ronald Arthur Howard (August 27, 1934 – October 6, 2024) was an emeritus professor in the Department of Engineering-Economic Systems (now the Department of Management Science and Engineering) in the School of Engineering at Stanford University.

Howard directed teaching and research in decision analysis at Stanford and was the Director of the Decisions and Ethics Center, which examines the efficacy and ethics of decision making under uncertainties. He coined the term &quot;Decision Analysis&quot; in a paper in 1966, kickstarting the field. He was a founding Director and Chairman of Strategic Decisions Group. Interests included improving the quality of decisions, life-and-death decision-making, and the creation of a coercion-free society. Howard also taught a graduate-level course, &quot;Voluntary Social Systems,&quot; which investigated the means of constructing and operating a coercion-free society.

In 1986 he received the Operations Research Society of America&#x27;s Frank P. Ramsey Medal &quot;for distinguished contributions in decision analysis&quot;. In 1998 he received from the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) the first award for the teaching of operations research/management science practice. In 1999 INFORMS invited him to give the Omega Rho Distinguished Plenary Lecture at the Cincinnati National Meeting.

Howard was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1999 for contributions to the foundations of decision analysis and its application. He received the Dean&#x27;s Award for Academic Excellence. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. The Raiffa-Howard award for organizational decision quality is named after him and Howard Raiffa.

Howard earned his Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1958 (under George E. Kimball) and was an associate professor there until he joined Stanford in 1965. He pioneered the policy iteration method for solving Markov decision problems, and this method is sometimes called the &quot;Howard policy-improvement algorithm&quot; in his honor. He was also instrumental in the development of the Influence diagram for the graphical analysis of decision situations.

In 1980 Howard introduced the concept of micromort as a one-in-a-million chance of death.

<doc id="1219105" wikidata="Q5132210" url="?curid=1219105" title="Cleveland Police">
<text>Cleveland Police is a territorial police force in England responsible for the policing the boroughs of Middlesbrough and Redcar and Cleveland in North Yorkshire and Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham within North East England. The force is overseen by the Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner. Since 2022, the chief constable has been Mark Webster. 

The force covers an area of with a recorded population of 569,000 in 2011. Geographically, the force has the second smallest police area of the 43 territorial police forces of England and Wales, after the City of London Police. The force is responsible for policing a predominantly urban area with higher levels of deprivation than average in the United Kingdom. 

In terms of officer numbers, Cleveland Police is the 12th smallest of the 48 police forces of the United Kingdom. As of September 2017, the force had 1,274 police officers, 278 police staff, 124 police community support officers and 64 special constables.
In the 2019 annual assessment by His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Cleveland Police was rated &#x27;inadequate&#x27; overall and rated &#x27;inadequate&#x27; in all review areas, concluding that &quot;crime prevention isn&#x27;t a priority for the force and this is a cause of concern&quot;.

==History==
The force was established as Cleveland Constabulary on 1 April 1974, covering the newly created county of Cleveland (which was abolished on 1 April 1996, being replaced with the four unitary authorities). It was renamed Cleveland Police, from Cleveland Constabulary.

It is a successor to the Teesside Constabulary, and also the York and North East Yorkshire Police, which existed before 1974, and also took over part of Durham Constabulary. The police area is the second smallest geographically, after the area covered by the City of London Police.

Under proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, a proposal for a merger with Northumbria Police and Durham Constabulary to form a single strategic police force for the North East England was suggested. Cleveland Police proposed instead merging with the southern area of Durham Constabulary. In July 2006, the plans to merge the three forces were abandoned. 

=== New force headquarters ===

On 31 January 2007, the new headquarters in Middlesbrough were opened, boasting a 50-cell custody unit including a purpose-built prevention of terrorism suite, one of only three in the country. It has been designed to increase the speed and safety of detainee handling with secure vehicle docking, video links to court and CCTV links in all cells for improved prisoner safety.

The Middlesbrough headquarters is the centrepiece of Cleveland Police Authority&#x27;s multi-million pound private finance initiative project which has also seen a new headquarters for Redcar and Cleveland district and new town offices in Redcar and South Bank. The building, which was officially opened by the then Home Secretary John Reid, is seen as not only the spearhead to policing Cleveland in the 21st century but also the gateway to the regeneration of the St Hilda&#x27;s area of the town and the flagship Middlehaven project.

=== Volunteer scheme ===
In 2008, Cleveland Police launched its volunteer scheme, by which members of the local community can offer a minimum of 4 hours a week helping the force. As the scheme progresses more roles are expected to become available.

=== Cadets scheme ===

On 5 January 2009, the force launched its cadets programme, something which many other police forces have operated for some years. There are 20 places available in each district, and the cadets will meet each week in groups run by police officers, police community support officers, youth workers and volunteers. There will also be the chance to gain recognised qualifications, such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award.

=== &#x27;Special measures&#x27; ===
In September 2019, the Cleveland police force was put into special measures, after His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) rated the service as inadequate overall and in three key areas: the extent to which the force is effective at reducing crime and keeping people safe; operates efficiently and sustainably; and treats the public and its workforce legitimately were all found inadequate. HMICFRS said that the force was &quot;putting the public at risk.&quot; There have been five chief constables since 2012. Staff described the force as, &quot;directionless, rudderless and clueless&quot;. Vulnerable people including children were not identified and left at risk. Despite large numbers of domestic abuse victims being repeat victims offenders were not always proactively pursued. There were delays before police tried to locate youngsters reported missing. Some victims of honour-based violence and survivors allegedly had had a &quot;terrible experience&quot;. Crime rose 17.6% in the year to 2019 but according to the watchdog, &quot;crime prevention isn&#x27;t a priority for the force and this is a cause of concern&quot;. The quality of investigations needs improvement, the watchdog maintains. High-ranking officers and staff were in many cases, &quot;not taking responsibility&quot; and some were &quot;not acting with honesty, integrity and competence&quot;. Cleveland police is in the, &quot;special measures&quot; police equivalent, after a report showing the force failed to prevent crime, protect the public, apprehend criminals or deal with internal corruption.

=== Resignation of Police and Crime Commissioner ===
A year after the publication of the report, the Labour Cleveland police and crime commissioner (PCC), Barry Coppinger, resigned. Coppinger cited stress and the workload impacting on his health for his resignation. His resignation was immediate in September 2020 and an interim PCC took over until an election for the post in May 2021, in which Steve Turner of the Conservative Party was elected.

===Officers killed in the line of duty===
The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers.

Since 1893 the following officers of Cleveland Police were killed while attempting to prevent or stop a crime in progress:
* Police Constable William Henderson, 1893 (shot attempting to disarm a man).

== Force structure ==
As of September 2017, the force had 1,274 police officers, 278 police staff, 124 police community support officers and 64 special constables. 

Cleveland Police area is divided into four local policing areas (LPAs), previously known as districts, which are coterminous with the four unitary authorities of Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton-on-Tees. These LPAs are split between North and South of the River Tees for operational purposes.

In response to a Freedom of Information Act request in July 2018, Cleveland Police published (in October 2018) the organisational structure of its &#x27;Basic Command Units / Local Policing Units / District Policing Teams or equivalent&#x27;. The chart shows the number of police officers of each rank assigned to each unit.

== PEEL assessments ==
His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Cleveland was rated as follows:

==Alleged or actual offences involving serving officers==
In 2007, it was reported that Detective Constable Steve Pennington, who was convicted of a drink driving offence in 2000 and jailed for four months, had been granted a £500,000 pay-off by the force garnering much criticism from members of the public and anti drink driving campaigners.

In April 2012, Cleveland Police admitted liability for &quot;malicious prosecution&quot; and were ordered to pay out over £841,000, one of the largest compensation sums in UK police history. The court was told former PC Sultan Alam was &quot;stitched up&quot; by fellow officers after he launched industrial tribunal proceedings in 1993, complaining of racial discrimination following a series of incidents that included a Ku Klux Klan poster being left on his desk. Cleveland Police admitted that officers suppressed evidence that lead to Mr Alam being wrongfully imprisoned for conspiracy to steal motor parts and enduring a 17-year battle to clear his name. Mr Alam, who was, as of 2012, considering a position in public office, did not believe that the force had improved and stated that racism had gone &quot;underground&quot;, with ethnic minorities being denied the same opportunities as their white colleagues.

In October 2012 the force&#x27;s chief constable, Sean Price, was sacked after being found guilty of deceit and misconduct. He was dismissed from his £190,000 a year job (one of the highest rates in the country for a chief constable), having been suspended in August 2011 on full pay.

In May 2013, Cleveland Police agreed to pay a settlement of £550,000 to James Watson, a Middlesbrough solicitor who sued them for false imprisonment after being detained for almost 30 hours.

In January 2019, Chief Constable Mike Veale resigned after being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) on a matter of &quot;serious allegations&quot; of misconduct.

==Shared services==
Cleveland Police shares a number of specialist policing services with other police forces. 

===Specialist Operations Unit===
In 2010, Cleveland Police and neighbouring Durham Constabulary merged firearms and roads policing teams through a joint Specialist Operations Unit.

===Dogs===
Cleveland Police, Durham Constabulary and North Yorkshire Police merged their dog section in 2016. The agreement ended in 2019 and the three forces returned to having their own independent dog sections. 

===Force helicopter===
Cleveland was previously a member of the North East Air Support Unit helicopter sharing agreement with neighbouring Durham Constabulary and Northumbria Police in which all three forces shared two helicopters, one based at Newcastle Airport and the other at Teesside Airport.

In 2008, Durham and Northumbria decided that just one helicopter based at Newcastle Airport would be enough. Cleveland disagreed saying that this resource would be based many miles away from Cleveland and would leave it at a disadvantage, and would not agree to the proposal. As a result, Durham and Northumbria decided to leave the consortium of the three forces and forge a new agreement without Cleveland, leaving Cleveland to fund its own helicopter from 2009, when the former North East Air Support Unit agreement officially ended, and the Cleveland Air Operations Unit was formed.

Since 2012, air support to the force has been provided by the National Police Air Service (NPAS).

<text>Knäppupp (Swedish: &quot;unbutton&quot;) was the collective name of a popular revue series produced by Swedish musician and entertainer Povel Ramel. It was associated with Knäppupp AB, the production company that was set up specifically for the purpose of managing and financing the theatrical performances. The company was active from 1952 to 1968. Ramel was the driving force behind the revues and wrote and performed most of the material himself. Among the more prolific co-actors were Martin Ljung and Brita Borg.

== History ==
Povel Ramel and Per-Martin Hamberg had worked in Radiotjänst&#x27;s entertainment department, where Ramel made innovative radio programs such as &quot;The Hunt for Johan Blöth&quot;, &quot;The Association for the Promotion of Flying&quot;, &quot;Four Around a Grand Piano&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hålm&#x27;s Fates and Adventures&quot;, in which Brita Borg and Martin Ljung participated. When the swaying artist and entertainment producer Felix Alvo came up with a proposal for a collaboration, the result was the production &quot;Akta huvet&quot; at Cirkus in Gothenburg in 1952, where the ensemble was expanded to include Maj-Britt Thörn, Gunwer Bergqvist and Oscar Rundqvist, among others. &quot;Anything except revue,&quot; said Ramel, giving the phenomenon the name Knäppupp. In 1953, Alvo and Ramel took over the Odeon Theatre at Brunkebergstorg in Stockholm, which was renamed Idéonteatern. This was followed by annual productions, which were usually performed from the autumn at Idéon and in circus tents Sweden around the following summer, until 1968, when the theatre was demolished to build the Culture House. Ramel was then ready for activities in another form, PoW Show with Wenche Myhre and performances with Sven Olson&#x27;s trio.

Typical for Knäppupp were unconventional approaches inspired by American crazy humor, elastic game openings, where sleepwalkers, chimney sweeps, polar explorers and doctors joked with the audience already at the entrance, crazy whims such as Ramel&#x27;s entrance via a tense wire from the other side of the circus room and an artificial rain in the finale &quot;Follow me out in the rain&quot;. Particular inspiration came from the stage version (original) of the film &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;&quot;&quot;&#x27; which Ramel had previously experienced at the London Palladium After the first few years, the humour and sketches became more conventional, but many are the song and sketch classics that originate from Ramel and Knäppupp: &quot;The Old Restaurant Trio&quot;, &quot;Nature Children&quot;, &quot;Ester&quot;, &quot;Siskorna i björken&quot;, &quot;Fat Mammy Brown&quot;, &quot;Fingal Olsson&quot; and so on &quot;All 4&quot; (1960) appointed Povel, Gunwer, Martin, Brita as a kind of core troupe, while &quot;Dax again&quot; (1962) was a large and ambitious anniversary pop with new wild crazy grips. The four reunited in &quot;Karamellodier&quot; på Berns (1972) and in &quot;Knäpp igen&quot; (1992), which was an anniversary production with modern artists and Wenche plus Brita, Gunwer and Martin as alternating guest artists.

For a few years, Knäppupp was probably the definition of Swedish humor and good musical entertainment. The company was a giant in Swedish entertainment that produced theatre as well as films and gramophone records with all kinds of artists, not just Knäppupps. Ideon also featured Karl Gerhard revues, operettas with Nils Poppe, guest performances by Denmark&#x27;s revue king Stig Lommer and American musicals. Ramel wrote most of it himself, but also got help from Martin Ljung, Yngve Gamlin, Hasse Ekman, Hasseåtage, Beppe Wolgers and many more to keep the tent and the theater well filled. Later entertainment producers such as Svenska Ord avoided tying themselves as tightly to one and the same theatre and institutionalised forms of touring.

The Knäppupptent, at least parts of it, lived on when it was rented out to the socialist theatre tour Tältprojekt, which travelled around Sweden in a similar way but with different intentions in the summer of 1977.

<doc id="1219109" wikidata="Q1738172" url="?curid=1219109" title="The Thrills">
<text>The Thrills are an Irish pop band originally formed in Dublin in 2001. The band was founded by lead vocalist Conor Deasy and guitarist Daniel Ryan, guitarist and bass player Padraic McMahon, pianist Kevin Horan and drummer Ben Carrigan. Their break came with their debut album, &quot;So Much for the City&quot;, which became an Irish number one and charted at number 3 in the UK. The band&#x27;s sound has been described as &quot;inspired by classic American pop of the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s&quot; by Rovi and &quot;an ocean-soaked, harmony-heavy homage to California&#x27;s dreamy dreams, shaking ground, and unrelenting sunshine&quot; by &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot;.

==Early history and &quot;So Much for the City&quot;==

The Thrills were formed in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock in the mid-1990s, when neighbours Conor Deasy and Daniel Ryan formed the Cheating Housewives with friends Kevin Horan, Padraic McMahon and Ben Carrigan. Several of the members attended primary school together at Hollypark Boys School in Foxrock. In 1999, the band spent four months living in San Diego, during which time they wrote several of the tracks that would eventually appear on their debut album &quot;So Much for the City&quot; (such as &quot;One Horse Town&quot;). Upon returning to Dublin, they began writing and demoing more material, hoping to secure a record deal – which they soon did with local label Supremo Records, home of fellow Irish band Chicks. The relationship with Supremo produced no releases and was short-lived; when they were dropped by the label several months later, the band members pointedly chose not to inform their parents.

During a trip to San Francisco in 2001, the band decided to change their name to The Thrills. Later that year they recorded six songs over the span of two demos. The second demo made a favourable impression on Johnny Davis of Bright Star Recordings and BMG Publishing. Through Davis, indie label Rough Trade Records became aware of the band and was impressed, offering the Thrills the money to record another demo. The Rough Trade demo was recorded, but by then label interest in the band had grown rapidly, with up to thirty A&amp;R men and record personnel attending the band&#x27;s next musical showcase gig. In September 2002, The Thrills signed with Virgin Records, attracted by the promise of artistic freedom and the label&#x27;s decision to allow them to record their debut record in Hollywood with producer Tony Hoffer (Beck, Air).

After releasing their debut EP in November 2002, the band flew to Los Angeles in December 2002 to record their debut album &quot;So Much for the City&quot;. &quot;So Much for the City&quot; was released in 2003, debuting at No. 1 in Ireland, No. 3 in the UK and going platinum in both the UK and Irish Album Charts. The album was nominated for the 2003 Mercury Prize but lost to Dizzee Rascal&#x27;s &#x27;Boy in da Corner&#x27;. The album also won the 2003 Q Award for Best New Act, and Best New Act at the 2003 Irish Meteor Awards.

In 2004 The Thrills won an EBBA Award. Every year the European Border Breakers Awards (EBBA) recognize the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.

==&quot;Let&#x27;s Bottle Bohemia&quot;==
The Thrills&#x27; second album &quot;Let&#x27;s Bottle Bohemia&quot; was released in September 2004. It was recorded in L.A. (where their first album had also been recorded) – this time with Dave Sardy as producer, featuring orchestration by Van Dyke Parks and a guest mandolin performance by R.E.M.&#x27;s Peter Buck. The album enjoyed similar success to the band&#x27;s debut, entering the charts at number one in Ireland and number nine in the U.K. – largely on the back of the single &quot;Whatever Happened To Corey Haim?&quot;.

That same year, the band took part in the Band Aid 20 charity assemble, and performed the song &quot;Santa Cruz (You&#x27;re Not That Far)&quot; at the Live 8 Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push charity concert, which is also featured on the DVD release of the event. The band also performed a medley with Ronnie Wood of their single &quot;The Irish Keep Gatecrashing&quot; and the Rod Stewart song &quot;Maggie May&quot; at the Irish Meteor Awards 2005.

The band performed a medley of songs from the album on the U.S. television series &quot;The OC&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;The Ex-Factor&quot;.

==Extended break and &quot;Teenager&quot;==

The band took an extended break after their second album, in an effort to evolve their sound. New material was written, and recording sessions took place in New York during 2006. Failing to meet the band&#x27;s standards, many of these new songs were ultimately discarded, and remain unreleased.

&quot;We were definitely striving for a new standard,&quot; Deasy said in 2007. &quot;We were willing to scrap months of work on songs, which is one of the reasons it took so long. We recorded maybe 30 songs.&quot; During an interview with indie music magazine &quot;Under The Radar&quot; in October 2007, Deasy stated: &quot;We wrote about 30 songs for this album, and a lot of the songs we discarded. They weren&#x27;t poor songs. They were perfectly good songs, but they were songs that could have fit on the first or the second album a little too easily.&quot;

More new material was written, including &quot;Midnight Choir&quot; which became the opening track for &quot;Teenager&quot; and was also released as a single. At the suggestion of R.E.M., the five relocated to a renovated morgue (owned by Canadian musician Bryan Adams) in inner-city Vancouver to record their third album with Tony Hoffer, who had previously produced their debut album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Featured article - /The Thrills&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Teenager&quot; was released in Ireland on 22 July 2007 and Central Europe on 25 July 2007. It failed to light up the British and Irish charts and received generally positive reviews, getting a Metacritic score of 71%, positive reviews from the BBC, 7/10 from the NME, a 6.9/10 from Pitchfork and a 2/5 review from &quot;The Guardian&quot;. A special CD/DVD edition of &quot;Teenager&quot; – which contained a film-length documentary about the band entitled &quot;The Thrills: The End of Innocence&quot; – was given limited release in the UK only.

==Post-&quot;Teenager&quot;==

The band was dropped by EMI in 2008 after the poor performance of their &quot;Teenager&quot; album, which only charted at No. 48 in the UK.

In an August 2010 interview with the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, Ben Carrigan confirmed that the Thrills remain on indefinite hiatus. At the time, Carrigan was working on his debut solo record entitled &quot;The Greatest Narrators&quot;, which was released on 23 September 2011. The first single from this album (&quot;You Knew It All Along&quot;) was released on 19 August 2011.

While promoting his album in September 2011, Carrigan said of the Thrills: &quot;We&#x27;re just on a hiatus. We haven&#x27;t done anything since 2008, when we toured Australia. We never split up, but we&#x27;re all working on other projects. In time, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get back together. It just got a bit crazy for a while because we were away from home, so we needed to take a break.&quot; During an interview with &quot;Hot Press&quot; in late October 2011 Carrigan stated: &quot;It&#x27;s like a past life now, the whole Thrills thing, to be honest. Which is kind of nice because it&#x27;s good to always feel like you&#x27;re moving forward as opposed to looking back and wondering what might have been.&quot;

On 22 August 2011, Virgin Records (the Thrills&#x27; former label) released a &#x27;best of&#x27; compilation entitled &quot;2002–2007&quot;. The compilation contained no previously unreleased or bonus material; all the tracks had been previously released in the Thrills&#x27; first three studio albums. To date, &quot;2002–2007&quot; has not been released in stores; the disc is only available through Amazon&#x27;s UK site. A digital-only edition is available on Amazon&#x27;s US site.

Kevin Horan would join Little Green Cars as a touring member with Daniel Ryan as their manager.

==In popular culture==
* The band&#x27;s US west coast ethos was satirised by Irish television personality Dustin the Turkey on his 2005 song &quot;Stillorgan 90210&quot; from the album &quot;Bling When You&#x27;re Mingin&quot;&#x27;.

<text>[[Peter Andreas Munch|P. A. Munch. &lt;br&gt; Engraving by [[W. Obermann]]]]

Peter Andreas Munch (15 December 1810 – 25 May 1863), usually known as P. A. Munch, was a Norwegian historian, known for his work on the medieval history of Norway. Munch&#x27;s scholarship included Norwegian archaeology, geography, ethnography, linguistics, and jurisprudence. He was also noted for his Norse legendary saga translations.

==Background==

Munch was born in Christiania (now Oslo). He was the son of Edvard Storm Munch and Johanne Sophie Hofgaard. Munch was the uncle of the famous painter Edvard Munch.

He grew up at Gjerpen parsonage, where his father was parish priest of the Church of Norway. He was schooled in the city of Skien. He attended the Royal Frederick University. Munch first studied law and took his state examination in 1834, but then turned to historical and philological studies.

==Career==
Munch&#x27;s first great achievement, with Rudolph Keyser, was their three volumes of &quot;Norges Gamle Love&quot; (Norway&#x27;s old laws), edited after a two-year research visit to Copenhagen. In 1837, he became lecturer in history at the University of Oslo and in 1841 became a professor of history. In 1857, after producing numerous publications, he received a large grant for archives research in Rome and lived there from 1859 to 1861. Munch served as Norway&#x27;s national archivist from 1861 to 1863. He was one of the first non-Catholics to be allowed into the archives of the Vatican. He took extensive notes from the volumes of papal letters, and sometimes drew accurate facsimiles of the texts. His research there was useful in his main work, &quot;Det norske Folks Historie&quot; (&quot;History of the Norwegian People&quot;), in eight volumes, and he sent his notes home to the Royal Archives in Christiania. Among the theories he is remembered for is the theory on immigration to Norway, in which he developed work done by Rudolf Keyser. On a trip back to Rome to fetch his family, who had remained there for a while, he died from a stroke, and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.

==&quot;The Chronicles of Mann and the Sudreys&quot;==

In this work, Munch translated the 3rd Chronicle of the Chronicles of Mann from a Codex transferred to the British Museum (formerly owned in 1620 by one Sir Robert Cotton). The manuscript is the only known copy of this Codex (and thought to be the only one). In any event, Munch translated runic characters and added historical notes to lend light upon the writings, and using previous works on the history of Scottish and Icelandic Isles to aid in the presentation of the translated material. He also edited &quot;Chronica regvm Manniae et insvlarvm&quot;: The chronicle of Man and the Sudreys (1874) with Alexander Goss.

==Controversial views about the Finno-Ugric peoples==
Munch claimed in his article on Finnish nationality (&quot;Om Finlands Nationalitet og dens Forhold til den svenske&quot;) in 1855, that Finns and Hungarians must have a human race of their own.

<text>Taproot is an American alternative metal band from Ann Arbor, Michigan, formed in 1997. Its lineup consists of vocalist/guitarist Stephen Richards, bassist Phil Lipscomb, drummer Jarrod Montague, and guitarist Taylor Roberts. They are best known for their hit single &quot;Poem&quot;, which peaked at No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 2002.

Taproot originally consisted of Richards, Lipscomb, Montague, and guitarist Mike DeWolf. After a few independent releases in the late 1990s, they signed to the major label Atlantic Records in 1999. Their debut album on the label, &quot;Gift&quot;, was released in 2000. Both of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Again &amp; Again&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, attained moderate success. Taproot&#x27;s breakthrough came in 2002, with the album &quot;Welcome&quot;, which featured the lead single &quot;Poem&quot; as it peaked at No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No. 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Ultimately, &quot;Welcome&quot; sold over 500,000 copies. The release of 2005&#x27;s &quot;Blue-Sky Research&quot; produced the single &quot;Calling&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock chart. However, the album did not match its predecessor&#x27;s success. As a result, Atlantic and Taproot parted ways in 2006.

The band released &quot;Our Long Road Home&quot; in 2008, which was immediately followed by drummer Montague&#x27;s departure and the addition of Nick Fredell. Taproot then released &quot;Plead the Fifth&quot; in 2010, which featured the moderately successful single &quot;Fractured (Everything I Said Was True)&quot;, followed by &quot;The Episodes&quot;, in 2012. Subsequently, Fredell was replaced on drums by Dave Coughlin in 2013, and guitarist DeWolf was replaced by Dave Lizzio in 2015. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;SC\SSRS&quot;, came out in 2023. The record&#x27;s announcement coincided with the return of Montague on drums and the addition of Taylor Roberts on guitar.

==History==
===Formation and independent releases (1997–1999)===
Taproot was formed in 1997 in Ann Arbor, Michigan by vocalist Stephen Richards, guitarist Mike DeWolf, bassist Phil Lipscomb, and drummer Jarrod Montague. The band earned a following with their live performances. Shortly after forming, they recorded their first demos at Woodshed Studios in Oak Park, Michigan, with Tim Pak. In 1998, Taproot sent their demo to Limp Bizkit frontman, Fred Durst, after seeing a request for demos on their first album. Impressed with the material, Durst offered to get Taproot a recording contract through Interscope Records. However, after extended negotiations, Taproot decided to look elsewhere and finally landed a deal with Atlantic Records. Durst heavily cursed the band on vocalist Richards&#x27; answering machine.
Durst also allegedly put some blame on System of a Down, who assisted Taproot in securing the Atlantic deal. It is also alleged that Durst kicked System of a Down off the 1999 Family Values Tour. Taproot independently released their debut album, &quot;...Something More Than Nothing&quot; (1998), the EP &quot;Mentobe&quot; (1998), and their second record, &quot;Upon Us&quot; (1999) around this time.

===&quot;Gift&quot; and mainstream success with &quot;Welcome&quot; (2000–2004)===
Taproot released their major-label debut album, &quot;Gift&quot;, on June 27, 2000, through Atlantic Records. The lead single, &quot;Again &amp; Again&quot;, gained heavy exposure through MTV2, and it was the band&#x27;s first charting single, as it peaked at No. 39 on the Mainstream Rock chart and also at No. 95 on the UK Singles Chart. With the help of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s son Jack, Taproot landed a spot on the second stage of the 2000 and 2001 Ozzfest tour. &quot;Gift&quot;&#x27;s second single, &quot;I&quot;, also managed to chart at No. 34 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 2001.

After spending seven months in Los Angeles, the band released their second album, &quot;Welcome&quot;, on October 15, 2002. Considered to be a more melodic effort, the album debuted at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 51,000 copies in its first week of release. Much of this was due to the success of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Poem&quot;, which shot to No. 5 on the Mainstream Rock chart. &quot;Poem&quot; did not appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but it did peak at No. 6 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Mine&quot;, followed with moderate success, as it peaked at No. 23 on the Mainstream Rock chart and at No. 26 on the Alternative Songs chart. Ultimately, &quot;Welcome&quot; became Taproot&#x27;s most successful album to date, with over 500,000 copies sold.

After performing across North America on Disturbed&#x27;s Music as a Weapon Tour as well as playing in Europe, Taproot took a two-year break from touring.

===&quot;Blue-Sky Research&quot; and departure from Atlantic (2005–2006)===
Returning from their hiatus, Taproot released their third major-label studio album, &quot;Blue-Sky Research&quot;, on August 16, 2005. Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins assisted in songwriting on the album, which was produced by Toby Wright. It debuted at No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with approximately 28,000 first-week sales. The lead single, &quot;Calling&quot;, (co-written by Jonah Matranga), was used by WWE as the theme song for the 2005 pay-per-view Unforgiven. It also peaked at No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock chart and at No. 23 on the Alternative Songs chart.

Taproot acted as direct support to Chevelle alongside Thirty Seconds to Mars. The band then headlined a major tour with Evans Blue and From Satellite to promote the album&#x27;s release. Taproot also participated in the Fall Brawl Tour, which featured Staind and P.O.D. as headliners and was notable for taking the then-unknown Flyleaf along as the opening act for the three bands.

On May 23, 2006, it was reported that Taproot had parted ways with Atlantic Records after disappointing sales of &quot;Blue-Sky Research&quot;. At the time, the album had sold 112,000 copies since its release.

===&quot;Our Long Road Home&quot; and Montague&#x27;s departure (2007–2009)===
On March 5, 2007, Taproot confirmed that they were in the process of recording their sixth album, entitled &quot;Our Long Road Home&quot;, with producer Tim Patalan. On March 2, 2008, the band released the song &quot;You&#x27;re Not Home Tonight&quot; on their website.

According to the Taproot website, the band decided to forgo signing to a major label. The album would be released independently through their management firm, Velvet Hammer Music, in a 50/50 partnership with the band itself; however, distribution was handled by Sony-owned RED Music. &quot;Our Long Road Home&quot; was released on September 16, 2008. Just over a week after it was issued, Taproot announced that longtime drummer Montague would be leaving the band, to be replaced by Nick Fredell. They released a statement regarding the change in lineup:
&quot;After 10 years of touring, our drummer and good friend Jarrod will be sitting out this cycle and we will be replacing him with our long time friend Nick Fredell. We&#x27;ll miss Jarrod&#x27;s presence out on the road, but Nick has fit in perfectly and we&#x27;re excited for all of our fans to meet him. Jarrod&#x27;s still very much a part of our family, so you&#x27;ll be seeing him in press and the &#x27;Wherever I Stand&#x27; video which is out now on Youtube...&quot;

Taproot toured with Sevendust and Dear Enemy around this time. &quot;Our Long Road Home&quot;&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Wherever I Stand&quot;, ultimately peaked at No. 34 on the Mainstream Rock chart. In the spring of 2009, Taproot went on the road with Dear Enemy and Adakain for the Take It! tour. Later that year, they co-headlined a US tour with Cold.

===&quot;Plead the Fifth&quot; and &quot;The Episodes&quot; (2010–2012)===
After a brief period without a record label, Taproot signed with Victory Records. On April 1, 2010, the band released the lead single from the then-upcoming album, &quot;Fractured (Everything I Said Was True)&quot;. It peaked at No. 18 on the Mainstream Rock chart. A video followed, debuting on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel on April 16. Soon after, the band released their seventh studio album, &quot;Plead the Fifth&quot;. Taproot promoted &quot;Plead the Fifth&quot; with a headlining run in the summer of 2010, with support from Ice Nine Kills and label-mates Destrophy.

In September 2011, Taproot announced they were preparing to record their eighth studio album, working with producer Patalan once again and recording at the Loft Studios in Saline, Michigan. On December 15, the band announced that the album was recorded and should be released in the spring of 2012. On January 8, 2012, Taproot&#x27;s official website was closed and re-launched as a brand new one on February 7, 2012. In addition to the new site, the band also revealed their sixth album&#x27;s title, &quot;The Episodes&quot;. During the following weeks, Taproot offered a video every Tuesday about their upcoming album. On March 2, 2012, they issued the first single, titled &quot;No Surrender&quot;. It peaked at No. 38 on the Mainstream Rock chart. &quot;The Episodes&quot; was then released on April 10, 2012.

In an October 14 interview, Richards spoke candidly about his bout with seizures and how his medical issues had affected touring and onstage performances. Taproot supported &quot;The Episodes&quot; with a headlining Winter Riot Tour (with 12 Stones, Digital Summer, 3 Pill Morning, and Prospect Hill).

===Anniversary shows, lineup changes, and &quot;Besides&quot; (2013–2022)===
The first half of 2013 saw Taproot playing their major label debut album, &quot;Gift&quot;, in its entirety on tour with Boy Hits Car and Intertwined. On June 16, 2013, drummer Fredell announced on his Twitter account that he had departed the band, citing &quot;some bad blood&quot;. He was replaced by Dave Coughlin. The band did not issue an official statement addressing the lineup change.

On July 9, 2015, a statement was released by Lipscomb, stating that DeWolf was not interested in continuing with the band. A replacement on lead guitar was not immediately named.

On August 4, 2015, the Alice in Chains book &quot;Alice in Chains: The Untold Story&quot; was released, and it mentioned an unfinished collaboration between original frontman Layne Staley and Taproot. Just prior to his death from an overdose, Staley was set to record vocals for a Taproot song that was written for their 2002 album, &quot;Welcome&quot;. The &quot;spacey-sounding&quot; track, initially named &quot;Kevin Spacey&quot;,
would ultimately remain instrumental.

On August 8, 2015, Taproot played at Dirt Fest in Birch Run, Michigan, with Dave Lizzio, formerly of Nonpoint, as the band&#x27;s guitarist. The performance was also notable for its guest appearance of founding member Montague on drums. It was the band&#x27;s first show since the departure of DeWolf.

On September 6, 2016, Taproot announced that they would be releasing a rarities collection entitled &quot;Besides&quot;.

On February 27, 2017, they announced on Banana 101.5 that they would play their second album &quot;Welcome&quot; in its entirety. Original drummer Montague also appeared at the anniversary concert, along with his band WestFall as the opening act. Taproot performed on May 13 and 14, 2017, at the Machine Shop in Flint, Michigan. During the concert, they premiered a new song entitled &quot;No One Else to Blame&quot;.

On October 16, 2017, the band announced a twentieth-anniversary show and performed on December 23 at Token Lounge in Westland, Michigan. Montague played drums on older songs, while Coughlin performed more recent material. The compilation &quot;Besides&quot; was released as an eight-disc, 130-track box set in December 2018.

===&quot;SC\SSRS&quot; (2023–present)===
A condensed version of &quot;Besides&quot;, titled &quot;Best of Besides&quot;, was announced in early 2023, with a release date of April 30, 2023. A double-LP vinyl was planned to follow on September 30. The compilation will contain remastered versions of eighteen tracks from the &quot;Besides&quot; box set.

In February 2023, Taproot announced that they would be releasing a new album, titled &quot;SC\SSRS&quot;, on September 29. This would be their first studio release since 2012&#x27;s &quot;The Episodes&quot;.

The first single from &quot;SC\SSRS&quot;, titled &quot;V\CT\M \ PLAY&quot;, was released on April 6, 2023. The band stated that Montague had rejoined the lineup, although Coughlin planned on playing sporadic one-off shows in Montague&#x27;s absence. In addition, it was announced that Taylor Roberts had replaced Lizzio on guitar.

On August 9, 2023, Taproot issued the single &quot;No One Else to Blame&quot;. Another track, &quot;Favourite Song&quot;, came out in September. &quot;SC\SSRS&quot; was officially released on September 29, via the independent label THC Music.

==Musical style and influences==
Some of the bands that have influenced Taproot include Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Van Halen, and Rush. In 2001, the band were announced to be contributing a cover of the song &quot;Ricochet&quot; for a Faith No More tribute album, but the project never came to fruition. Their sound has been compared to Deftones, Fugazi, Helmet, Korn, and Tool.

<text>Gathering of Developers, Inc. (shortened as G.O.D. or GodGames, and branded as Gathering between 2003 and 2004) was an American video game publisher based in New York City. Founded by Mike Wilson and associates in January 1998 and originally based in Dallas, the company was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in May 2000. Between May 2000 and March 2001, Gathering of Developers also operated a division, On Deck Interactive, which acted as their mass market label. In August 2001, Take-Two Interactive closed Gathering of Developers&#x27; Dallas headquarters and moved the label in-house, to New York City. The label was shut down in September 2004, with all assets consumed by Global Star Software.

== History ==
Gathering of Developers was announced by Mike Wilson in 1997, with the official opening scheduled for January 1998. Wilson had previously been the CEO of Ion Storm, a video game developer. Wilson&#x27;s stated vision for the company was to have a video games publisher run by experienced developers rather than marketeers and conventional businessmen. Gathering of Developers was initially an alliance of eight development companies, with each of the founding companies having an equity in the publisher and a representative on the board of directors.

The opening of the company took place on January 13, 1998. Co-founders included Harry Miller, Jim Bloom, Rick Stults and Doug Myres. The same month, video game developer Terminal Reality became an equity partner of Gathering of Developers, through which their vice-president, Brett Combs, took a seat on the publisher&#x27;s board of directors. Other founding partners included Edge of Reality, 3D Realms, Epic Games, PopTop Software, and Ritual Entertainment. By February 1998, the company had struck an investment deal with Pennsylvania Merchants Group. On June 1, 1998, video game publisher Take-Two Interactive announced a &quot;subsistantial non-equity investment&quot; in Gathering of Developers, wherein Take-Two Interactive would distribute games published by Gathering of Developers. Take-Two Interactive later went on to acquire a 20% stake in the company by February 1999. Also in February 1999, Gathering of Developers co-founded the Independent Games Festival, which was to premier Game Developers Conference, and also co-hosted and funded the 1999 edition of it. In May 1999, Gathering of Developers signed an agreement with Sega to distribute eight of their games on the Heat.net platform.

During the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade shows, Gathering of Developers offered free barbecue, live music and beer to the nearly 10,000 attendees that would cross the street into their parking lot, dubbed the &quot;Promised Lot&quot;. At the 2001 edition of the event, Gathering of Developers&#x27; booth displayed booth babes dressed up as schoolgirls to promote their adult content.

On May 1, 2000, Take-Two Interactive announced that they had acquired Gathering of Developers. The deal was signed mainly due to Gathering of Developers&#x27; financial instability. On May 4, 2000, Take-Two Interactive and Gathering of Developers launched On Deck Interactive as a publishing label for games with &quot;a consumer friendly price point and a mass market appeal&quot;. Following the departure of On Deck Interactive&#x27;s CEO Robert Westmoreland, the label was shut down again on March 5, 2001, with all of its upcoming games shifted to Gathering of Developers. On May 3, 2001, Gathering of Developers co-founder Myres unexpectedly died of an asthma attack. In his honor, Gathering of Developers announced the &quot;Doug Myres Substance Award&quot; in June that year, which would be handed out at the July 2001 edition of the Cyberathlete Professional League, with a donation to the Dallas Children&#x27;s Advocacy Center made in the recipient&#x27;s name. Gathering of Developers&#x27; Dallas offices were closed down by Take-Two Interactive in August 2001, with all operations relocated to Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s headquarters in New York City. All staff were laid off or left the company, most of which were then hired by SubstanceTV, a new venture previously launched by Wilson and Myres. By February 2003, Gathering of Developers had been shortened to Gathering. On September 9, 2004, following poor financial results in Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s Q3 2004 fiscal quarter, Gathering of Developers was folded into Global Star Software, Take-Two Interactive&#x27;s budget range publishing label.

<doc id="1219115" wikidata="Q462427" url="?curid=1219115" title="Mezmerize">
<text>Mezmerize is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band System of a Down, released on May 17, 2005, by American Recordings and Columbia Records. Upon its release, the album received acclaim from critics. The album sold over 450,000 copies in its first week (over 200,000 more than &quot;Toxicity&quot; did), and immediately topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background==
&quot;Mezmerize&quot; and &quot;Hypnotize&quot; are considered two parts of a double album. &quot;Mezmerize&quot; features guitarist Daron Malakian sharing most of the vocal work with vocalist Serj Tankian, splitting the vocals at least halfway on many of the tracks.

Malakian wrote &quot;Old School Hollywood&quot; after playing in a celebrity baseball game for charity. The song mentions Tony Danza and Frankie Avalon, who also played in the game.

In &quot;Radio/Video&quot;, there are lines referring to two people named Danny and Lisa. Malakian commented on the song to &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine:

In the same interview, Daron Malakian talked about the &quot;non-stop disco&quot; lines in &quot;Violent Pornography&quot;:

The Japanese version of the album contains alternate mixes of &quot;Soldier Side (Intro)&quot; and &quot;Lost in Hollywood&quot;, the former with additional strings and the latter containing slightly different background vocals, while &quot;Cigaro&quot; as a bonus track on the single for &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot; contains a 4-stick hit intro not present in the retail version. The album artwork is done by Vartan Malakian, the father of Daron Malakian.

==Reception==

&quot;Mezmerize&quot; was acclaimed by critics, scoring 85 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The album debuted at number one in at least 12 countries, including the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 453,000 copies, and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA. The hit single &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot; won a Grammy Award in 2006 for Best Hard Rock Performance.

<text>East River Park, also called John V. Lindsay East River Park, is public park located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, administered by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Bisected by the Williamsburg Bridge, it stretches along the East River from Montgomery Street up to 12th Street on the east side of the FDR Drive. Its now-demolished amphitheater, built in 1941 just south of Grand Street, had been reconstructed and was often used for public performances. The park includes football, baseball, and soccer fields; tennis, basketball, and handball courts; a running track; and bike paths, including the East River Greenway, all of which are to be demolished. Fishing is another popular activity, for now.

The park and the surrounding neighborhood were flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 prompting the city officials to consider flood mitigation plans that would alter it. In December 2019, the New York City Council voted to approve the controversial $1.45 billion East Side Coastal Resiliency project, involving the park&#x27;s complete demolition and subsequent renovation, and is slated for completion in 2026. A New York Harbor Storm-Surge Barrier is also under consideration, which would also demolish and rebuild this and other parks.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Conceived in the early 1930s by Robert Moses, East River Park opened on July 27, 1939. Prior to this time, the East River waterfront had been an active shipping yard and later became home to many of the city&#x27;s poorest immigrants. 

The park became the largest open green space on the Lower East Side. Since that time, the park has been encroached upon by various developments such as the widening of the FDR Drive and the extension of South Street. Still, the park provides a respite for residents of the area, particularly in summer months when there are refreshing breezes from the river.

In 1998, through an agreement with the New York City Parks Department, the Lower East Side Ecology Center became the steward of the park. For 20 years, this local environmental nonprofit has been the park&#x27;s caretaker and had its offices and education center inside the Fire Boat House, located in the park near the Williamsburg Bridge. Each year the Ecology Center led thousands of volunteers in up-keeping the park, tending to garden beds, and enhancing the park by planting hundreds of thousands of native plants and bulbs.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the city rebuilt the amphitheater, which had fallen into disrepair. A new soccer field was also built at this time. Companies throughout the U.S. donated materials for the reconstruction, and the project was finished in record time and dedicated to those children who lost parents in the attacks. In December 2001, East River Park was renamed after former New York City Mayor John Lindsay.

In 2008 the City Parks Foundation brought free music, dance, and theater arts programming to the amphitheater in an effort to further engage the surrounding communities in the revitalization of the park. The first performance held was a music concert by Fiery Furnaces which drew an audience of 1,500. KRS-One and Willie Colón also performed that year, drawing crowds upward of 3,000 people.

=== Proposals for reconstruction ===
Hurricane Sandy flooded the East River Park and the Lower East Side in 2012 prompting city officials to consider flood mitigation plans that would alter the park. In June 2013, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Shaun Donovan launched Rebuild by Design, a competition which called for experts to develop solutions for neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Ten of the 150 proposals were selected as finalists, and seven received a total of $930 million in federal grants. The largest grant, totaling $335 million, was given to the &quot;Big U&quot; proposal, a berm surrounding Lower Manhattan. One of the largest segments of the Big U was known as the East Side Coastal Resiliency project, and promised to improve the resiliency of the park and the surrounding Lower East Side neighborhood. The resulting plan, supported by local residents, elected officials, and advocacy groups, included an 8-foot berm along FDR Drive from East 23rd Street to Montgomery Street, which would decrease the severity of flooding in the surrounded area. From 2015 to 2018 city agencies continued the process of participatory design that the Big U&#x27;s designers had commenced.

Starting in early 2018 the City underwent a months-long internal &quot;value engineering review&quot;, in which they met with designers and planners to determine the feasibility of the proposal. A FOIA request for documentation of this review process revealed several obstacles to the original plan, including concerns about flooding and the location of high-voltage Con-Edison power lines. In September 2018 the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that, based on the findings of the internal value engineering review, the proposed berm would be completely removed and the whole park would be raised. It was claimed that the new plan would be faster and less disruptive, moving the bulk of the construction away from residents directly alongside FDR Drive, instead placing the improvements alongside the water. The new plan was referred to by its engineers as the &quot;Value Alternative LI-29&quot; plan.” The review determined that this plan would be not only be more effective but also cheaper and faster, a concern that addressed the 2022 deadline associated with HUD funding (now extended to 2023).

Following their announcement, the plan had to be approved by Community Boards 3 and 6, and then the New York City Council. In July 2019, the new plan was presented to Community Board 3 by the Department of Design and Construction (DDC), following several months of public consultation with residents. The City Council typically defers to incumbent councilmembers regarding land-use decisions in their districts; in the East River Park decision, these were councilmembers Margaret Chin of District 1 and Carlina Rivera of District 2. Both secured concessions from the city. Original plans called for closing the park entirely from 2020 to 2023, but after protests from residents, the plans were modified in late 2019 to a partial five-year closure. In December 2019, the City Council voted to approve the $1.45 billion East Side Coastal Resiliency project, which would involve a complete demolition of the park and subsequent renovation that will elevate it by ; the project is slated for completion in 2025.

=== Renovation ===
In early 2022, construction on the southern half of the park commenced, beginning with the demolition of athletic fields, the amphitheater, and a section of the East River Esplanade. Work is expected to last until 2026, during which time significant sections of the park will be closed. Asbestos was found in a sub-basement structure under the amphitheater in late August 2022, and has raised concerns from activists. The city announced that it had completed asbestos abatement in October 2022, nine months after the demolition of the amphitheater. In September 2024, the city government finished reconstructing two of the park&#x27;s ballfields, and it opened a new footbridge at Delancey Street. 

==== Criticism ====
Critics of the current renovation plan have voiced concerns over the cost, oversight, lack of resident involvement, destruction of plants (including more than 1,000 mature trees), and animal habitats. One alternative presented by critics was a plan for storm barriers along the FDR. Community members also argue that the park closure will primarily impact low-income NYCHA residents and that, in reality, the renovation project will leave the Lower East Side especially vulnerable to storm surge during the renovation.

Supporters of the current plan include Councilwoman Rivera, other Democratic politicians, and Good Old Lower East Side (GOLES).

In February 2020, a dozen groups and 75 individuals, including members of East River Park Action, sued the city to stop the ESCR based on the grounds that the plan would sever the park from the surrounding community and requires approval from the state legislature. State Supreme Court Justice Melissa Crane ruled against opposition groups and in August 2020, the city was given approval to begin park demolition. 

The demolition began in December 2021, prompting protests and court orders against the work. State Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou and incoming city councilman Christopher Marte expressed support for the protesters.

<doc id="1219118" wikidata="Q3525015" url="?curid=1219118" title="Thomas Crisp">
<text>Thomas Crisp VC, DSC, RNR (28 April 1876 – 15 August 1917) was an English sailor and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross. Crisp, in civilian life a commercial fisherman operating from Lowestoft in Suffolk, earned his award after being killed during the defence of his vessel, the armed naval smack &quot;Nelson&quot;, in the North Sea against an attack from a German submarine in 1917.

Crisp&#x27;s self-sacrifice in the face of this &quot;unequal struggle&quot; was used by the government to bolster morale during some of the toughest days of the First World War for Britain, in late 1917, during which Britain was suffering heavy losses at the Battle of Passchendaele. His exploit was read aloud by David Lloyd George in the Houses of Parliament and made headline news for nearly a week.

==Early life==
Thomas Crisp was born into a family of shipwrights and fishermen in Lowestoft, one of ten children to William and Mary Anne Crisp. Although his father was the owner of a successful boatbuilding firm and thus could afford an education for his children, Thomas did not enjoy school, instead showing a &quot;marked preference for quayside adventure to school routine&quot;. 

Leaving school, Thomas took to the sea, spending several years as a herring fisherman before joining a fishing trawler out of Lowestoft. He was a natural to the work, being a remarkably good sailor, but tired of it quickly and joined the Atlantic steamship SS &quot;Mobile&quot;, becoming her quartermaster and making several trans-Atlantic voyages.

In 1895, aged 19, he met and married Harriet Elizabeth Alp and settled with her at 48 Staithe Road in Burgh St. Peter near Lowestoft, where they had two sons and a daughter, including Thomas Crisp Jr, who would be with his father on the day he won the Victoria Cross. Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, one of the largest boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their ketch &quot;George Borrow&quot;, in which he remained for thirteen years. In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea, proving one of the most popular fishing captains in Lowestoft and joined on his ketch by his son in 1913.

When the First World War began in July 1914, Crisp was at sea. Unaware of the outbreak of war, he remained in the North Sea for several days, and was surprised on his return to learn that enemy submarines were expected off the port at any moment. When this threat failed to materialise, Thomas Crisp returned to fishing, considered too old for military service and in an occupation vital to Britain&#x27;s food supplies. In late September, &quot;George Borrow&quot; passed , and shortly before they were all sunk, with over a thousand lives lost, by German U-boat . Tom Crisp Jr. later wrote of finding bodies in their fishing nets for weeks afterwards.

==War service==
In early 1915, Tom Crisp Jr left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U-boat threat expected so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive was part of a wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. &quot;George Borrow&quot; was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Tom Crisp (father) was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, in the same manner as Q-ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes.

Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by mid-1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, arranging for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack &quot;I&#x27;ll Try&quot;, armed with a 3-pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, &quot;I&#x27;ll Try&quot; had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger &quot;Boy Alfred&quot;. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post-war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean-going Q-ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife&#x27;s sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.

==Victoria Cross action==
In July, &quot;I&#x27;ll Try&quot; was renamed &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Boy Alfred&quot; became &quot;Ethel &amp; Millie&quot;, in an effort to maintain their cover. The boats continued to operate together and Crisp&#x27;s crew was augmented with two regular seamen and a Royal Marine rifleman, providing &quot;Nelson&quot; with a crew of ten, including Crisp and his son. The smacks set out as usual on 15 August and pulled in a catch during the morning before making a sweep near the Jim Howe Bank in search of cruising enemies. At 2.30 pm, Crisp spotted a German U-boat on the surface away. The U-boat also sighted the smack and both vessels began firing at once, the U-boat&#x27;s weapon scoring several hits before &quot;Nelson&quot;″s could be brought to bear. By this stage in the war, German submarine captains were aware of the decoy ship tactics and no longer stopped British merchant shipping, preferring to sink them from a distance with gunfire.

With such a heavy disparity in armament between the smack&#x27;s 3-pounder and the submarine&#x27;s 88 mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the &quot;Nelson&quot; could get within range of her opponent. The fourth shot fired by the U-boat holed the smack, and the seventh tore off both of Crisp&#x27;s legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat&#x27;s four carrier pigeons: like many small ships of the era, &quot;Nelson&quot; did not possess a radio set.

The sinking smack was abandoned by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered that he should be thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son&#x27;s arms a few minutes later. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. &quot;Ethel &amp; Millie&quot; had just arrived on the scene as &quot;Nelson&quot; sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for &quot;Nelson&quot;″s lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.

The crew of &quot;Ethel &amp; Millie&quot; then abandoned their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the &quot;Nelson&quot; survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of &quot;Ethel &amp; Millie&quot; were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion at the time was that they were killed and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, as the German government had made it clear they regarded the crews of merchant ships who fought back against U-boat attacks as &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;, and thus liable to execution. These scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner and killed when the submarine was sunk. UC-63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.

The survivors of &quot;Nelson&quot; drifted for nearly two days until they arrived at the Jim Howe Buoy, where they were rescued by the fishery protection vessel &quot;Dryad&quot;. A pigeon named &quot;Red Cock&quot; had reached the authorities in Lowestoft with news of the fate of the boats and caused the &quot;Dryad&quot; to be despatched to search for survivors.

A court of enquiry praised the surviving crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and Distinguished Service Medals to his son and another member of the crew. On 29 October 1917, David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the House of Commons citing Crisp&#x27;s sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy&#x27;s commitment &quot;from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan&quot;, which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as it did a story of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and perceived German barbarity. The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 1917. Crisp is memorialised on his wife&#x27;s gravestone in Lowestoft Cemetery.

===Citations===


The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the following honours, decorations and medals to officer and men for services in action with enemy submarines: —

Skipper Thomas Crisp, R.N.R., 10055D.A.

(Killed in action).

&quot;The London Gazette&quot;, 30 October 1917



On the 15th August, 1917, the Smack &quot;Nelson&quot; was engaged in fishing when she was attacked with gunfire from an enemy submarine. The gear was let go and the submarine&#x27;s fire was returned. The submarine&#x27;s fourth shot went through the port bow just below the water line and the seventh shell struck the skipper, partially disembowelling him, and passed through the deck and out through the side of the ship. In spite of the terrible nature of his wound Skipper Crisp retained consciousness, and his first thought was to send off a message that he was being attacked and giving his position. He continued to command his ship until the ammunition was almost exhausted and the smack was sinking. He refused to be moved into the small boat when the rest of the crew were obliged to abandon the vessel as she sank, his last request being that he might be thrown overboard.

(The posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to Skipper Thomas Crisp, D.S.C., R.N.R., 10055 D.A., was announced in London Gazette No. 30363, dated 2 November 1917).
&quot;The London Gazette&quot;, 20 November 1918
==Post-war remembrance==

After the war, a small display in memory of Crisp was set up in Lowestoft Free Library and another in Lowestoft Maritime Museum. The former contained a specially commissioned painting and parts of the sunken &quot;Nelson&quot;, which were dredged up years later. This display was destroyed during the Second World War when the building was gutted in the Blitz. A new display featuring a replica of the Victoria Cross awarded to Crisp currently stands in Lowestoft Town Hall. The original is held securely by the local council after Crisp&#x27;s family felt his interests would not be served if the medal were held privately. It can be viewed on request.

Crisp&#x27;s name is inscribed on the Chatham Naval Memorial for those lost at sea during the First World War, as well as two church memorials in Lowestoft to the town&#x27;s war dead, St. John&#x27;s and St. Margaret&#x27;s. The latter church also contains a &quot;VC Bell&quot; dedicated to his memory. Tom Crisp Way, a street in his native Lowestoft, is named in his honour.

In a footnote to the action, the pigeon &quot;Red Cock&quot;, which brought news of the engagement to the authorities, was stuffed upon his death and was mounted in the Thomas Crisp display at Lowestoft Town Hall for many years before being reportedly relocated to a museum in South Kensington.

<text>Captain George Fiott Day, (20 June 1820 – 18 December 1876) was a Royal Navy officer and one of the earliest recipients of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also a Knight of the Legion of Honour.

==Naval career==
George Fiott Day was born in Southampton. He joined the Royal Navy as a First Class Volunteer in 1833. His first vessel sailed to the Pacific Ocean and was wrecked off the coast of Patagonia in 1835. After serving off the west coast of Africa, in 1838 he departed for six and a half years service in the Mediterranean Sea, taking part in the bombardment of St. John d&#x27;Acre on the Syrian coast in 1840. From 1845 to 1848, he served in Africa, before departing for the Cape of Good Hope and the coast of Brazil. During the hostilities between the Argentine Confederation and Buenos Aires, he patrolled the Rivers of Paraguay and the Río de la Plata. In 1854, he was sent to the Baltic Sea, and then back to the Mediterranean Fleet, and eventually to the Black Sea in 1855, where he won his Victoria Cross. He was 35 years old, and a lieutenant during the Crimean War:

In 1857, Day was again off the west coast of Africa, and in late 1858 he sailed for the China Station. He was placed on the Captain&#x27;s retired list in February 1867, owing to ill health. He retired with the rank of captain.

==Personal life==
In 1858, Day married Mary Ruddell-Todd, the daughter of James Ruddell-Todd, and his wife Eliza Henrietta Campbell, daughter of Duncan Campbell, 5th of Inverneill House. His wife&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a brother of Sir James Campbell of Inverneill and a nephew of General Sir Archibald Campbell. Mrs Day was a first cousin of Emily Georgina Carter-Campbell of Possil and Willoughby Harcourt Carter. The Days were the parents of three daughters. Captain Day died at Weston-super-Mare, where he is buried. His grave in Milton Road Cemetery, Weston super Mare was unmarked until 1982 when a memorial headstone was installed.

<doc id="1219129" wikidata="Q2081455" url="?curid=1219129" title="An Experiment with Time">
<text>An Experiment with Time is a book by the British soldier, aeronautical engineer and philosopher J. W. Dunne (1875–1949) about his precognitive dreams and a theory of time which he later called &quot;Serialism&quot;. First published in March 1927, the book was widely read. Although never accepted by mainstream scientists or philosophers, it has influenced imaginative literature ever since. Dunne published four sequels: &quot;The Serial Universe&quot; (1934), &quot;The New Immortality&quot; (1938), &quot;Nothing Dies&quot; (1940) and &quot;Intrusions?&quot; (1955).
==Description==
===Overview===
&quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; discusses two main topics.

The first half of the book describes a number of precognitive dreams, most of which Dunne himself had experienced. His key conclusion was that such precognitive visions foresee future personal experiences by the dreamer and not mere general events.

The second half develops a theory to try to explain them. Dunne&#x27;s starting point is the observation that the moment of &quot;now&quot; is not described by science. Contemporary science described physical time as a fourth dimension and Dunne&#x27;s argument led to an endless sequence of higher dimensions of time to measure our passage through the dimension below. Accompanying each level was a higher level of consciousness. At the end of the chain was a supreme ultimate observer.

According to Dunne, our wakeful attention prevents us from seeing beyond the present moment, whilst when dreaming that attention fades and we gain the ability to recall more of our timeline. This allows fragments of our future to appear in pre-cognitive dreams, mixed in with fragments or memories of our past. Other consequences include the phenomenon known as deja vu and the existence of life after death.

===Dreams and the experiment===
Following a discussion of brain function in which Dunne expounds mind-brain parallelism and highlights the problem of subjective experience, he gives anecdotal accounts of precognitive dreams which, for the most part, he himself had experienced.

The first he records occurred in 1898, in which he dreamed of his watch stopping at an exact time before waking up and finding that it had in fact done so. Later dreams appeared to foretell several major disasters; a volcanic eruption in Martinique, a factory fire in Paris, and the derailing of the Flying Scotsman express train from the embankment approaching the Forth Railway Bridge in Scotland.

Dunne tells how he sought to make sense of these dreams, coming slowly to the conclusion that they foresaw events from his own future, such as reading a newspaper account of a disaster rather than foreseeing the disaster itself. In order to try and prove this to his satisfaction, he developed the experiment which gives the book its title. He kept a notepad by his bedside and wrote down details of any dreams immediately on waking, then later went back and compared them to subsequent events in his life. He also persuaded some friends to try the same experiment, as well as experimenting on himself with waking reveries approaching a hypnagogic state.

Based on the results, he claimed that they demonstrated that such precognitive fragments were common in dreams, even that they were mixed up in equal occurrence with past memories, and therefore they were difficult to identify until after the event they foresaw. He believed that the dreaming mind was not drawn wholly to the present, as it was during wakefulness, but was able to perceive events in its past and future with equal facility.

===The theory of Serialism===
Having presented Dunne&#x27;s evidence for precognition, the book moves on to a possible theory in explanation which he called Serialism.

The theory harks back to an experience with his nurse when he was nine years old. Already thinking about the problem, the boy asked her if Time was the moments like yesterday, today and tomorrow, or was it the travelling between them that we experience as the present moment? Any answer was beyond her, but the observation formed the basis of Serialism.

Within the fixed spacetime landscape described by the recently published theory of general relativity, an observer travels along a timeline running in the direction of physical time, &quot;t&quot;1. Quantum mechanics was also a newly emerging science, though in a less-developed state. Neither relativity nor quantum mechanics offered any explanation of the observer&#x27;s place in spacetime, but both required it in order to develop the physical theory around it. The philosophical problems raised by this lack of rigorous foundation were already beginning to be recognised.

The theory resolves the issue by proposing a higher dimension of Time, &quot;t&quot;2, in which our consciousness experiences its travelling along the timeline in &quot;t&quot;1. The physical brain itself inhabits only &quot;t&quot;1, requiring a second level of mind to inhabit &quot;t&quot;2 and it is at this level that the observer experiences consciousness.

However, Dunne found that his logic led to a similar difficulty with &quot;t&quot;2 in that the passage between successive events in &quot;t&quot;2 was not included in the model. This led to an even higher &quot;t&quot;3 in which a third-level observer could experience not just the mass of events in &quot;t&quot;2 but the &quot;passage&quot; of those experiences in &quot;t&quot;2, and so on in the infinite regress of time dimensions and observers which gives the theory its name.

Dunne suggested that when we die, it is only our physical selves in &quot;t&quot;1 who die and that our higher selves are outside of mundane time. Our conscious selves therefore have no mechanism to die in the same kind of way and are effectively immortal. At the end of the chain he proposed a &quot;superlative general observer, the fount of all ... consciousness&quot;.

==Publishing history==
&quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; was first published by A &amp; C Black in March 1927. Dunne continued to update it and many new editions and impressions were published over his lifetime. Black brought out a 1929 second edition, prefaced with editorial notes and an extract from a 1928 letter from Arthur Eddington. Dunne then changed publisher to Faber &amp; Faber, with whom he would remain. The third edition incorporated major new material and was published by Faber&#x27;s in 1932; this and subsequent editions were published in the US by Macmillan. The final version which he had a hand in was published as a &quot;reprint&quot; in 1948.

Faber continued printing paperback editions until at least 1973, and others have appeared since.

==Reception==

=== Academic ===
Initial reactions from the scientific and scientifically-minded community were broadly positive. &quot;Nature&quot; carried a review by Hyman Levy. They accepted that Dunne was a sober and rational investigator who was doing his best to take a scientific approach. They acknowledged that if his ideas about time and consciousness were true then his book would be truly revolutionary. However opinions differed over the existence of dream precognition, while his infinite regress was almost universally judged to be logically flawed and incorrect.

Philosophers who criticised &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; on much the same basis included J. A. Gunn, C. D. Broad and M. F. Cleugh.

Physicist and parapsychologist G. N. M. Tyrrell explained:

Mr. J. W. Dunne, in his book, &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot;, introduces a multidimensional scheme in an attempt to explain precognition and he has further developed this scheme in later publications. But, as Professor Broad has shown, these unlimited dimensions are unnecessary, ... and the true problem of time—the problem of becoming, or the passage of events from future through present to past, is not explained by them but is still left on the author&#x27;s hands at the end.

Later editions continued to receive attention. In 1981 a new impression of the 1934 (third) edition was published with an introduction by the writer and broadcaster Brian Inglis. The last (1948) edition was reprinted in 1981 with an introduction by the physicist and parapsychologist Russell Targ. A review of it in &quot;New Scientist&quot; described it as a &quot;definitive classic&quot;.

Mainstream scientific opinion remains that, while Dunne was an entertaining writer, there is no scientific evidence for either dream precognition or more than one time dimension and his arguments do not convince.

=== Popular ===
&quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; became well known and was widely discussed. Not to have read him became a &quot;mark of singularity&quot; in society.

Critical essays on Serialism — some positive, some negative — appeared in popular works. Among others, H. G. Wells wrote an essay, &quot;New Light on Mental Life: Mr. J.W. Dunne’s Experiments with Dreaming&quot; in 1927, Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short essay, &quot;El Tiempo y J. W. Dunne&quot; (Time and J. W. Dunne) in 1940. and J. B. Priestley gave an accessible account in his study &quot;Man and Time&quot; (1964). Interest remains today, with for example Gary Lachman discussing Dunne&#x27;s Serialism in 2022.

==Sequels==

Besides issuing new editions of &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot;, Dunne published sequels exploring different aspects of Serialism. &quot;The Serial Universe&quot; (1934) examined its relation to contemporary physics in relativity and quantum mechanics. &quot;The New Immortality&quot; (1938) and &quot;Nothing Dies&quot; (1940) explored the metaphysical aspect of Serialism, especially in relation to immortality. &quot;Intrusions?&quot; (1955) contained autobiographical accounts of the angelic visions and voices which had accompanied many of his precognitive dreams. It was incomplete at the time of his death in 1949; it was completed with the help of his family and finally published some years later. It revealed that he believed himself to be a spiritual medium. He had deliberately chosen to leave this material out of &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; as he judged that it would have affected the scientific reception of his theory.

==Literary influence==

The popularity of &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; was reflected in the many authors who subsequently referenced him and his ideas in literary works of fiction. He &quot;undoubtedly helped to form something of the imaginative climate of those [interwar] years&quot;. One of the first and most significant writers was J. B. Priestley, who used Dunne&#x27;s ideas in three of his &quot;Time plays&quot;: &quot;Time and the Conways&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Corner&quot;, and &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot;.

Dunne&#x27;s theory strongly influenced the unfinished novels &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien and &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; by C. S. Lewis. Tolkien and Lewis were both members of the Inklings literary circle. Tolkien used Dunne&#x27;s ideas about parallel time dimensions in developing the differing natures of time in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; between &quot;Lórien time&quot; and time in the rest of Middle-earth. Lewis used the imagery of serialism in the afterlife he depicted at the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, the closing tale in the Chronicles of Narnia.

Other important contemporary writers who used his ideas, whether as a narrative or literary device, included John Buchan (&quot;The Gap in the Curtain&quot;), James Hilton (&quot;Random Harvest&quot;), his old friend H. G. Wells (&quot;The Queer Story of Brownlow’s Newspaper&quot; and &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;), Graham Greene (&quot;The Bear Fell Free&quot;) and Rumer Godden (&quot;A Fugue in Time&quot;). Literary figures less overtly influenced included T.S. Eliot, James Joyce and Flann O&#x27;Brien.

Following Dunne&#x27;s death in 1949, the popularity of his themes continued. In Philip Jose Farmer&#x27;s 1952 science fiction novella &quot;The Lovers&quot; (expanded into a novel in 1961 &amp; &#x27;79) the religion of the Haijac Union derives from Isaac Sigman, a messianic figure of a thousand years prior to the events of the story. Sigmanism is the belief system of the &quot;Sturch&quot; (state-church) and it is clear that it is an elaboration, or variant, of Judaism. It incorporates Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Serialism&quot; with an extremely oppressive and coersive theocracy. Philippa Pearce&#x27;s 1958 childhood fantasy &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; makes use of Dunne&#x27;s theory of time and won the British literary Carnegie Medal. The writer Vladimir Nabokov undertook his own dream experiment in 1964, following Dunne&#x27;s instructions, and it strongly influenced his subsequent novels, especially &quot;Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle&quot;.

<doc id="1219130" wikidata="Q6233873" url="?curid=1219130" title="John Francis Cronin">
<text>John Francis Cronin (October 4, 1908 – January 2, 1994) was a Catholic priest of the Society of Saint Sulpice, who was an early advisor on anticommunism to freshman U.S. Representative Richard M. Nixon.

==Early life==
He was born October 4, 1908, in Glens Falls, New York. He graduated at the age of fourteen from St. Mary&#x27;s Academy. An essay that discussed the dangers faced by coal miners was published in the Glens Falls &quot;Post Star&quot;. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and seminary at the Sulpician seminary of the Catholic University of America, where he earned bachelor&#x27;s degrees in philosophy and sacred theology, and a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy. In 1932, Cronin was ordained at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, New York by Bishop Edmund F. Gibbons. He joined the Sulpicians, and in 1935, was awarded a doctorate in philosophy by Catholic University.

==Career==

===Teacher===
Cronin taught economics at St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland. While there, he published a pamphlet, &quot;A Living Wage Today&quot;, that built on Pope Pius XI&#x27;s encyclical, &quot;Quadragesimo Anno&quot;, and declared, &quot;The wage paid to the workingman must be sufficient for the support of himself and of his family.&quot; In 1938, Archbishop Michael J. Curley of Baltimore asked Father Cronin to establish a School of Social Action to instruct Catholic clergy in the church&#x27;s teachings on labor, which was later expanded to parishes. According to John T. Donovan, Cronin&#x27;s writing and teaching helped to sharpen his skills in the area of labor and economics.

He was also assistant director of the Department of Social Action for the National Catholic Welfare Conference.

===Anticommunist===

Around the end of the Second World War, Cronin wrote a report for the bishops on the Communist Party of the United States. He had the assistance of FBI officials, who unofficially provided some of the background material for him. When Richard Nixon was elected to Congress in 1946, he sought out information on Communism, and he was introduced to Cronin by Representative Charles J. Kersten (R.WI).

By early February 1947, U.S. Representative Charles J. Kersten had taken the newly elected Richard M. Nixon on several trips to Baltimore to meet with Cronin. At that time, Cronin shared with Nixon his 1945 privately circulated paper &quot;The Problem of American Communism in 1945&quot;, with much information from the FBI&#x27;s William C. Sullivan (who by 1961 would head domestic intelligence under Hoover). By May 1948, Nixon had co-sponsored a &quot;Mundt-Nixon Bill&quot; to implement &quot;a new approach to the complicated problem of internal communist subversion... It provided for registration of all Communist Party members and required a statement of the source of all printed and broadcast material issued by organizations that were found to be Communist fronts.&quot; On May 19, 1948, the bill passed the House by 319 to 58 but failed to pass the Senate. (The Nixon Library cites this bill&#x27;s passage as Nixon&#x27;s first significant victory in Congress.) During August 1948, Nixon pushed for further investigation of Alger Hiss based on allegations made early that month before the HUAC by Whittaker Chambers: his persistence helped pave the way for the subsequent Hiss Case with two trials in 1949 and a verdict against Hiss in January 1950.

In his paper &quot;The Problem of American Communism In 1945&quot;, Cronin wrote, &quot;In the State Department, the most influential Communist has been Alger Hiss.&quot; When Whittaker Chambers testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in August 1948 and said that Hiss was a Communist, Nixon had already known about the charge from his conversations with Cronin. After Nixon was elected Vice President, he asked Cronin for help in writing speeches, who became an unpaid assistant to Nixon; Cronin wrote the first draft of Nixon&#x27;s 1956 acceptance speech at the Republican Convention in San Francisco.

He authored the book &quot;Communism: A World Menace&quot;. However, despite his strong opposition to Communism, Cronin criticized Joseph McCarthy and similar anticommunists in the United States, whom he accused of fostering national disunity.

===Civil rights activist===
In the 1950s and 1960s, he strongly supported the civil rights in America. He wrote two of the bishops&#x27; statements on race relations and lobbied them to see that they accepted the drafts.

<doc id="1219131" wikidata="Q7498666" url="?curid=1219131" title="Shirley, London">
<text>Shirley is an area of south London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon. It lies north of Spring Park and Addington, east of Addiscombe, south of Monks Orchard and west of West Wickham, and 10 miles south-southeast of Charing Cross. Prior to the creation of Greater London in 1965, Shirley was in the administrative county of Surrey.

The Shirley area is split into Shirley proper (centred on Wickham Road), Shirley Oaks (to the north) and Upper Shirley (to the west); the suburbs of Monks Orchard and Spring Park are sometimes also considered to be sub-districts of Shirley.

== History ==
The name Shirley, first recorded in 1314, is thought to mean &#x27;shire clearing&#x27;, referring to its position adjacent to the traditional Kent-Surrey border, though it may instead mean &#x27;bright clearing&#x27;. It was long a small hamlet, with a large mansion (Shirley House) being built here in 1721; this was purchased by the businessman and member of parliament, John Maberley, in the mid-1800s. Around this period the population was growing, with more housing being built. St John&#x27;s Church was built in 1856 to serve the needs of the growing community, replacing a smaller chapel dating from 1835.

Shirley House was converted into the Shirley Park Hotel in 1912. In the 1930s. House building in the area rapidly expanded, largely consisting of suburban-style semi-detached houses, with the Monks Orchard estate also being built in this period. However some land escaped the building boom; Shirley Park Hotel was bought by the Whitgift Foundation in 1965 to become Trinity School in a new building constructed on the site.

Neighbouring the Trinity School grounds is Shirley Park Golf Course. To the south of Shirley are large areas of woodland, including Addington Hills and Threehalfpenny Wood. Parks and open spaces are dotted across the area, including Miller&#x27;s Pond in Spring Park. Central Shirley (along Wickham Road) contains a library, several shops and restaurants and two pubs - The Crown and the Shirley Inn.

==Shirley Oaks==

Shirley Oaks is situated north of central Shirley, abutting Monks Orchard. The land here was traditionally the property of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The area gets its name from Oaks Farm, which lay here circa 1800. The area began to be developed in the early 20th century, with the opening of the Shirley Oaks Children&#x27;s Home in 1903. Following the closure of the Home in 1982, the site was demolished and replaced with modern housing by Heron Homes. Part of the site was set aside for Shirley Oaks Hospital, a private healthcare centre which opened in 1986.

===Shirley Oaks Children&#x27;s Home===
The Shirley Oaks Children&#x27;s Home opened in 1903 and was run by the London Borough of Lambeth until its closure in 1982. It was the largest in the country. The children&#x27;s home consisted of 38 cottages on a site; it contained its own school. In 2014 allegations of abuse emerged, and the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association (SOSA) was set up. Between then and 2020, 1,760 people have described suffering sexual, physical and racial abuse while at the home. Children were &quot;drugged, tortured and sexually assaulted.&quot; The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse &quot;heard that despite widespread mistreatment of children, the authority (Lambeth Council) failed to investigate any allegations at the time.&quot;

The Metropolitan Police inquiry, Operation Midland, which examined all the borough&#x27;s children&#x27;s homes, concluded at least 35 men and women had abused children over a 20-year period. SOSA believes that over a 60-year period, over 120 abusers were involved.

To compensate victims of the abuse at Shirley Oaks (and also Lambeth Children&#x27;s Home), Lambeth Council has set up a Redress Scheme open until January 2022. The scheme is assisted by child abuse lawyers Ann Olivarius and Jeff Anderson of AO Advocates. As of January 2020, £30.7 million has been paid directly to victims.

==Upper Shirley==

Upper Shirley is situated to the south-west of Shirley proper and is centred on the junction of Upper Shirley Road and Oaks Road, adjacent to the Addington Hills and Shirley Park and Addington golf courses. The settlement is thought to have originated in the mid-18th century, originally under the name &#x27;Badger&#x27;s Hole&#x27;. The area was home to a brewery in the mid-18th century. In 1865 the Surprise pub opened. There was another pub in the area - The Sandrock - which was located at the junction of Upper Shirley Road with Sandpits Road, which closed in 2018. The area is largely affluent, especially along Bishops Walk.

=== Shirley Windmill ===

Upper Shirley&#x27;s most prominent landmark is the tower mill, which was built by Richard Alwen to replace the first mill on the site (built by his grandfather William Alwen in 1808) after it burnt down in 1854. By 1893, Alfred Rayson, the owner, was forced to abandon the mill as unviable. After closure the mill was allowed to deteriorate, being struck by lightning in 1899 and again in 1906.

In 1951 the mill and land were acquired by the Croydon Corporation. The mill was threatened with demolition when the new John Ruskin School was built but it was protected by its Grade II listed status and strong public interest. The school, now the John Ruskin College, later left the site and housing was built around the mill.

In August 1996, it was announced that the London Borough of Croydon was to receive a grant of £218,100 from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the mill. The grant money has helped restore the mill to working order and open it to the public.

Shirley Windmill is open to the public on the first Sunday of each month June to October open in May on National Mills weekend (Sunday) and usually open for the annual Open House Weekend (Sunday) in September.

<text>For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK (, abbreviated to TB/LNNK) was a free-market, national conservative political party in Latvia. In 2011, it dissolved and merged into the National Alliance.

The party was founded from smaller groups in 1993 as For Fatherland and Freedom (TB), with a focus on promoting the Latvian language and putting a cap on naturalisation of Latvian non-citizens. It won six Saeima seats in its first year, and 14 in 1995, when it entered the governing centre-right coalition. It merged with the moderate Latvian National Independence Movement (LNNK) in 1997, and moved its emphasis to economic liberalisation. TB/LNNK&#x27;s then-leader, Guntars Krasts, was Prime Minister from 1997 to 1998. It remained in government until 2004, and again from 2006.

Initially from the nationalist right, the party become more moderate after the 1997 merger. It also shifted from supporting economic interventionism to the free market. A predominantly ethnic Latvian party, the party&#x27;s support base was university-educated, middle class, and concentrated in Riga. The party was soft Eurosceptic, and was a member of the anti-federalist Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists. Its only MEP, party leader Roberts Zīle, sat with the ECR group in the European Parliament. It has caused some controversy with its participation in the Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires processions.

For the 2010 parliamentary election, it formed an alliance with the nationalist All for Latvia! party. In July 2011, both parties merged into a unitary party, bearing the name National Alliance.

==History==

===Foundation===
The roots of the party were in the &#x27;Third Awakening&#x27; of the Latvian independence movement in the late 1980s. It identified with the part of the movement, which insisted on a full restoration of independence for Latvia and legal continuity with the Republic of Latvia that existed until 1940, when it was annexed by the Soviet Union.

It was closely affiliated with the Citizens&#x27; Congress through which an alternative government was created that claimed lineage from the interwar government. Within this structure, parties developed which continued after the restoration of independence in 1991. Two of these parties, the &#x27;18th November Union&#x27; and &#x27;Fatherland&#x27;, merged in 1993 to form the centre-right &#x27;For Fatherland and Freedom&#x27; ( or &quot;TB&quot;). The new party took its name from the inscription on the Freedom Monument, and its focus was on undoing the effects of the Soviet occupation, especially promoting the Latvian language and tightening citizenship laws. The party took part in the 1993 election to the Saeima, and won six seats. A party with a similar background, the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNNK), won fifteen seats.

===Merger and referendums===
TB was the leading force behind two referendum proposals (in 1994 and 1998) to make Latvian citizenship laws stricter. In 1994, the proposition did not gather the necessary number of voter signatures. Before the 1995 election, TB signed a prospective coalition agreement, the centre-right &#x27;National Bloc&#x27;, with the LNNK and the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union, and presented a more rounded programme, based on the LNNK&#x27;s, although still concentrating on national identity issues. The party jumped to fourteen seats, becoming one of the four major parties in the Saeima, and leap-frogging the LNNK (which suffered a split from the secession of the populist right under Joachim Siegerist) as the main right-wing party. The party fell just short of a majority, with leader Māris Grīnblats&#x27;s right-wing coalition securing the support of 49 out of 100 deputies for the premiership. Instead, a broad centre-right coalition was formed with TB controlling four ministries under PM Andris Šķēle.

In 1997, the TB merged with the LNNK to form &#x27;For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK&#x27;, also known as the &#x27;Conservative Union&#x27;. In 1998, the proposal was defeated in a referendum, by a relatively small margin (45% of voters supporting the change and 52% rejecting it). At the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s, the party shifted its focus to economic issues.

===Government===

&quot;For Fatherland and Freedom&quot; was a part of coalition governments from December 1995 to February 2004. From 1997 to 1998, its representative, Guntars Krasts, was the prime minister. From February 2004 until November 2006, the party was in opposition. Although it only gained 8 seats in the 2006 election, the party was invited to become part of the ruling coalition, and it agreed to join.

&quot;For Fatherland and Freedom&quot; campaigned as a strong supporter of Latvia&#x27;s national interests and opponent of a federal Europe. &quot;For Fatherland and Freedom&quot; won 29% of votes and 4 of Latvia&#x27;s 9 seats in the 2004 European Parliament election. In the 2009 European election, the party lost most of its support, falling from nearly 30% to 7.5%, resulting in the loss of 3 of its 4 European seats.

The party attempted to join the centre-right Unity electoral alliance in 2010, but was rejected. Instead it joined with the more nationalist All for Latvia! (VL) in the National Alliance (&quot;Nacionālā Apvienība&quot;). In the 2010 election, the Alliance won eight seats, with VL winning six of them and TB/LNNK reduced to two.

In July 2011, both components of the National Alliance agreed to intensify their links and to re-organize the National Alliance as a unitary party under the same name. On TB/LNNK&#x27;s 17th and last delegate conference, 84 of 90 party representatives agreed with the merger, 3 opposed and 3 abstained.

==Ideology==
Constitutionally, the party treated the post-1991 Republic of Latvia not as a successor to the inter-war republic, but as a continuation, and considered all acts of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic illegitimate. The party opposed the naturalisation of the large population of Soviet-era migrants () that live in Latvia. The party&#x27;s stance towards the Soviet era lead Guntars Krasts&#x27;s government to make the Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires a public holiday, and its members to celebrate the Latvian Legion, part of the Waffen-SS.

The party was an advocate of the free market. The party&#x27;s position shifted over time from interventionism to liberalisation. Originally, the party based its Statism on the heavy interventionism of the inter-war republic. Of TB/LNNK&#x27;s predecessors, For Fatherland and Freedom was more sceptical of the free market, while the LNNK supported full privatisation, within the context of a welfare state and protectionism. After the merger, the party adopted free market economics as one of its main emphases, advocating a swift transition to a market economy.

The party held an anti-federal Europe, soft Eurosceptic position. It was the only centre-right party to have flirted with opposing membership of the European Union before Latvian accession. In March 2003, it changed to supporting membership, fearing that voting no would cause the country to lose support for economic reforms and security policy. The party campaigned in favour of accession in the November 2003 referendum.

The party was a strong advocate for the Latvian language. For example, it introduced a law mandating the public sector to ignore communication in any other language.

At the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance high-level panel meeting in 2005, Jean-Yves Camus, a French political scientist, described the party as &quot;on the borderline between conservative right and far-right&quot; and &quot;an ultra-nationalist party comparable in some respects to the far right&quot;.

==Political support==
A major cleavage in Latvian politics is between ethnic Latvians, from whom TB/LNNK received almost all of its votes, and ethnic Russians. In the 1998 election, ethnic Latvians were fifteen times as likely to vote for the party as ethnic Russians. The 1998 referendum on citizenship sponsored by TB/LNNK was supported by a majority of Latvians, but defeated overall by opposition from ethnic Russians.

The party was supported mostly by the middle class, with wealthier voters tending to vote either for TB/LNNK or Latvian Way. Before the parties merged in 1997, both TB and the LNNK received the most support from university graduates.

Riga was traditionally the party&#x27;s strongest area, with 40% of its voters in 1995 coming from the capital city. However, Riga&#x27;s politics are shifting from an ethno-linguistic cleavage to a socio-economic one, leading to a softening of this disparity in the 2001 municipal election.

Unlike most parties in Latvia, TB/LNNK never based its support on having a particularly populist leader.

==International relations and criticism==
The party was a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR), allying with amongst others, the British Conservative Party, Polish Law and Justice, and the Czech Civic Democratic Party. They sat with the AECR&#x27;s group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, in the European Parliament. Until 2009, TB/LNNK was a member of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations and sat with the UEN group.

In 2009, British foreign secretary David Miliband criticized Conservative Chairman Eric Pickles&#x27; decision to secure an alliance with TB/LNNK in the ECR group &quot;despite the fact that its members attend commemorations for the Waffen-SS&quot;. In a response, William Hague demanded an apology be made to TB/LNNK and the Latvian government from Miliband, describing his remarks as recycling &quot;false Soviet propaganda&quot; and noting that &quot;the majority of parties forming Latvia’s current Government including the Prime Minister’s party, have attended the commemoration of Latvians who fought in the Second World War&quot;.

The Israeli historian and Nazi-hunter Efraim Zuroff, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s office in Jerusalem, criticized the party&#x27;s &quot;obsession with paying public homage to the Latvian-SS Legion in contradiction to all historical logic and sensitivity to Nazi crimes&quot; in a column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 28 September 2009, while University of Vilnius professor Dovid Katz, writing that the British Conservatives must not be let &quot;off the hook for their dalliances with some of the worst racists and Holocaust perverters in eastern Europe,&quot; called for Pickles&#x27; resignation as chairman in October 2009.

==Electoral performance==
Electoral performance of TB/LNNK in the Saeima. TB/LNNK is in gold, as is its predecessor For Fatherland and Freedom. The performance of LNNK is in red (1993 and 1995) and that of VL in maroon (2010).

<text>CCGS &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; is a Canadian Coast Guard Improved serving in the Newfoundland and Labrador region and based in St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Entering service in 1988, &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; is the fourth ship and of an improved design over the rest of the ships in her class. The ship operates in the Arctic Ocean during summer months.

==Design==
Classified as a Medium Gulf/River Icebreaker by the Canadian Coast Guard, &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; was ordered to a modified design from the rest of the s. The vessel&#x27;s hull form differs from her classmates, with a differently-shaped bow with a raised forecastle and underwater &quot;ice knife&quot;. The vessel also has a different propulsion system. Furthermore, the ship has a Wärtsilä air-bubbling system installed to allow the vessel to reduce hull friction and more easily break ice. &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; displaces at full load. The vessel has a and a making her the largest vessel in the class. The icebreaker is long overall with a beam of and a draught of .

The ship is propelled by two fixed-pitch propellers driven by a diesel-electric system comprising two GE AC generators and three Wärtsilä Vasa 16V32 diesel engines. Combined, the system creates , giving the ship a maximum speed of . The ship carries of diesel fuel, giving the ship a range of at and can stay at sea for up to 90 days.

The icebreaker is equipped with a Sperry Marine Bridgemaster navigational radar. &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; has a flight deck and hangar which originally accommodated light helicopters of the MBB Bo 105 or Bell 206L types, but in the 2010s, the Bell 429 GlobalRanger and Bell 412EPI were acquired by the Canadian Coast Guard to replace the older helicopters. The ship can carry of aviation fuel for the helicopters. The vessel is certified as Arctic Class 4 and has a complement of 31 with 11 officers and 20 crew and 40 additional berths. The vessel is also equipped with a hospital ward.

==Service history==
The ship was ordered on 25 May 1984 as a replacement for . Ordered as the second batch of the class, the ship was of a modified design. The vessel&#x27;s keel was laid down on 23 August 1985 by Versatile Pacific Shipyards Limited at their yard in Vancouver, British Columbia with the yard number 110. The ship was launched on 3 January 1987, named after Henry Larsen, the commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police patrol vessel which was the first vessel to traverse the Northwest Passage in a single season. The ship entered service with the Canadian Coast Guard on 29 June 1988.

&quot;Henry Larsen&quot;, besides icebreaking duties along Atlantic Canada, provides search and rescue support, ship escort in iced-up areas in southern Canada during the winter and in Arctic waters in the summer and supports scientific research. On the ship&#x27;s maiden voyage from Victoria, British Columbia to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, the vessel transited the Northwest Passage, performing sea trials on the trip. The ship was initially assigned to the Coast Guard base at Dartmouth, but later transferred to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1998, an engine room fire took the ship out of service for some time.

In 2002, the icebreaker carried Governor General Adrienne Clarkson on ceremonial duties visiting several towns in Newfoundland. A 2004 voyage by &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; was the subject of the documentary film &quot;Ice Breaker&quot;. In 2008 Discovery Channel filmed an episode of &quot;Mighty Ships&quot; aboard &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; as the ship did an ice patrol around Notre Dame Bay in Newfoundland.

In September 2009 &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; participated in a training exercise with the Danish vessels and .

In September 2013, &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; was sent to aid sister ship in recovering a MBB Bo 155 helicopter that had deployed from &quot;Amundsen&quot; and crashed near Banks Island killing three crew members including &quot;Amundsen&quot;″s master. The helicopter had sunk in of water and &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; assisted &quot;Amundsen&quot; in keeping the ice clear while &quot;Amundsen&quot; brought the helicopter wreckage back to the surface. In August 2014, &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; took part in Operation Nanook, a joint military exercise that took place in the Davis Strait. On 7 July 2015, it was announced that &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; would undergo a $16 million refit at Davie Yards Incorporated in Lauzon, Quebec. In April 2017, &quot;Henry Larsen&quot; was dispatched to aid the ferry which had become stuck in ice in the Strait of Belle Isle near Blanc-Sablon, Quebec for over 24 hours. The icebreaker escorted the ferry to port once it was free of the ice.

He also commanded an army corps in the XYZ battle, in the Battle of Ebro and participated in the offensive of Catalonia. He led the Maestrazgo Army in the final offensive of the Spanish Civil War.

==Francoist Spain==
After the Civil War, he was named commander-in-chief of Melilla. In 1942, he became Chief of Staff of the Army. In 1944, he participated in the fighting against the Valle de Aran&#x27;s invasion by the Spanish Maquis. In 1947, he was promoted to lieutenant general and in charge of the captainship of the VII Military district. From 1951 to 1956, he was High Commissioner of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. In 1957, he was named director of the Superior School of the Army and, later, commander in chief of the First Military district, a position that he occupied until 1964.

In 1965, he established Air Spain together with the Banco del Noroeste and his relatives José Maria Rivero de Aguilar and Colonel Carbó.

<text>Sir Warington Wilkinson Smyth (26 August 181719 June 1890) was a British geologist.

==Biography==
Smyth was born at Naples, the son of Admiral W H Smyth and his wife Annarella Warington. His father was engaged in the Admiralty Survey of the Mediterranean at the time of his birth. Smyth was educated at Westminster School and Bedford School. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge crew in the 1839 Boat Race and graduated BA in 1839. Having gained a travelling scholarship he spent more than four years in Europe, Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt, paying great attention to mineralogy and mining, examining coal-fields, metalliferous mines and salt-works, and making acquaintance with many distinguished geologists and mineralogists.

Smyth married Anna Maria Antonia Maskelyne, daughter of Anthony Mervin Story Maskelyne, of Basset Down House, Wiltshire on 9 April 1864. One son, Herbert Warington Smyth, was also a mining engineer, a traveller, and a Geological Survey adviser to the government of Siam. Another son, Sir Nevill Maskelyne Smyth (1868–1941), won the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Omdurman.

Smyth died in his London home in Inverness Terrace, Bayswater, on 19 June 1890, but was buried at St Erth, not far from his country home at Marazion in Cornwall. He is commemorated by a wall plaque in Truro Cathedral, where he had been a founding member of the building committee responsible for its construction.

==Geological Survey==

On his return to England in 1844 Smyth was appointed mining geologist in the Geological Survey, and in 1851 lecturer at the Royal School of Mines, a post which he held until 1881 when he relinquished the chair of mineralogy but continued as professor of mining. In later years he became chief mineral inspector to the Office of Woods and Forests, and also to the Duchy of Cornwall.
He investigated the Roman gold mine at Dolaucothi and published a short paper on his observations in 1846 in &quot;Memoirs of the Geological Survey&quot;. Subsequently, he gave lectures on gold mining as a result of the then gold rushes in California and Australia in the 1850s.

Smyth was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1858. He became president of the Geological Society of London in 1866–1868, and in 1879 he was chairman of a Royal Commission appointed to inquire into coal mine accidents, the work in connection with which continued until 1886. He contributed sundry papers to the &quot;Memoirs of the Geological Survey&quot;, the &quot;Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society&quot; and the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall&quot;, serving as RGSC President from 1871–1879, and again from 1883–1890. He was also author of &quot;A Year with the Turks&quot; (1854), and of &quot;A Treatise on Coal and Coal-mining&quot; (1867). He was knighted in 1887. He was also a Knight of the Italian Order of SS. Maurizio and Lazzaro and of the Portuguese Order of Jesus Christ.

<doc id="1219143" wikidata="Q1163975" url="?curid=1219143" title="Million Dead">
<text>Million Dead are an English post-hardcore band from London, active between 2000 and 2005 with a reunion planned for 2025.

==History==
The band was founded in 2000 by Cameron Dean and Julia Ruzicka, after both came to London from Australia. They were joined by Ben Dawson, who had worked with Dean in a record shop in the city. The band&#x27;s lineup was completed with the addition of vocalist Frank Turner, an old bandmate of Dawson&#x27;s. The name was chosen from a lyric in the song &quot;The Apollo Programme Was a Hoax&quot;, by Swedish hardcore punk band Refused. The first Million Dead demo was recorded in September 2001.

The band&#x27;s touring career began with support sets for Cave In, The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, The Icarus Line and Alec Empire. In late 2002, the band signed to Integrity Records / Xtra Mile Recordings, and released their first single, &quot;Smiling At Strangers On Trains&quot;. The video for the single, directed by Adam Mason, proved controversial as it featured scenes of a homeless man urinating through a letterbox, as well as on Dean.

The single received support from John Peel, Mike Davies, Mary Anne Hobbs and Steve Lamacq, helping the band secure a support slot with Pitchshifter on their farewell tour.

The band entered the studio in April 2003 to record their debut album, &quot;A Song to Ruin&quot;, released in September, along with the single &quot;Breaking The Back&quot;. In December 2003, following a tour with Funeral for a Friend, Million Dead embarked on their first headline tour of the UK in support of the album, supported by Jarcrew and Minus.

In 2004, guitarist Cameron Dean announced he was leaving the band and was replaced by Tom Fowler. After a series of festival dates over the summer, the band re-entered the studio to record a new album. Written and recorded in eight weeks, &quot;Harmony No Harmony&quot; was released in May 2005, followed by another UK headline tour with Engerica and Days of Worth, and support dates on Finch&#x27;s UK tour.

Million Dead remixed the song &quot;Pop Idol&quot; by Blade, providing an instrumental-only arrangement for the rapper, the original song having previously appeared on his earlier record &quot;Storms Are Brewing&quot;.

In September 2005, it was announced via the band&#x27;s official website that Million Dead were to call it a day at the conclusion of their September tour, as &quot;irreconcilable differences within the band mean that it would be impossible to continue&quot;. The band played their final concert at Southampton&#x27;s Joiners venue on 23 September 2005.

Since the band&#x27;s breakup, vocalist Frank Turner has made a career as a solo folk/punk artist. Tom Fowler and Julia Ruzicka played guitar and bass in another band, Quiet Kill (2005–2006) and then Who Owns Death TV (2007–2009), and The Idle Hearts in 2009. Ben Dawson currently plays drums for Palehorse, Mothlite, Queen of Swords, Armed Response Unit and Mïngle Härde; a hardcore punk band he formed with Frank Turner and Matt Nasir of Turner&#x27;s backing band, The Sleeping Souls. Ruzicka also currently plays bass with Future of the Left, and played bass for Dream of an Opium Eater and Tricky on their tour in 2010. In November 2016, Ruzicka released her debut album under the name This Becomes Us. The album features 10 tracks written by Ruzicka and featuring Ian Wilson of Art Brut on guitar and Jack Egglestone of Future of the Left on drums. The first nine tracks on the album feature vocals recorded by what Ruzicka describes as &quot;9 very different, and very inspiring vocalists&quot;, including Black Francis.

In 2011, Turner commented on the band&#x27;s break-up. &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of all the music we made in that band,&quot; he said. &quot;It came to an end. The actual process of that end wasn&#x27;t very fun. I wouldn&#x27;t be doing what I&#x27;m doing now if I hadn&#x27;t done Million Dead before. I&#x27;m glad it happened. Once the end of Million Dead rolled around, I just didn&#x27;t want to be in a band anymore. The last year of Million Dead was just murderous. Four people who want to kill each other, sat in a van driving around Europe...it&#x27;s no fun.&quot; Turner has continued to perform &quot;Smiling At Strangers On Trains&quot; live since the split of the band, often including it in solo sets. In 2019, Mïngle Härde also began playing the song.

On 17 October 2024 an Instagram account was created, hinting at a 2025 reunion. On 23 October 2024 it was announced that a reunion would be taking place in 2025 with their original lineup consisting of Frank Turner, Julia Ruzicka, Tom Fowler, Ben Dawson and Cameron Dean.

<text>Hugh Cairns , (4 December 1896 – 2 November 1918) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
He was born in Ashington, Northumberland, England. The Cairns family immigrated to Canada and settled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1911 when he was 15 years old. He was a member of the Christ Church Choir, and as a keen footballer, he played for the Christ Church Intermediate Boys Football club, reaching the championship of the Sunday School League, scoring one goal in 104 matches. He also played for the St. Thomas Church team when they won the Saskatoon League Championship in 1915.

Hugh and his elder brother Albert enlisted in the army in August 1915. Cairns was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his actions at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. At the time the DCM was the second highest award for gallantry in the British honours system.

==VC details==
He was 21 years old, and a sergeant in the 46th (South Saskatchewan) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the Hundred Days Offensive of the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

With the German surrender and armistice on 11 November, ten days later, Sergeant Cairns would prove to be the last of seventy-one Canadians to earn the Victoria Cross for his actions in the Great War. Cairns was also awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the Government of France.

Cairns is buried in the Auberchicourt British Cemetery, seven kilometres east of Douai, France, roughly sixteen kilometres north of Cambrai, (Plot I, Row A, Grave 8).

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada.

In March 1936, the town of Valenciennes renamed a street in the vicinity of his actions on 1 November 1918 &quot;Avenue du Sergent Cairns&quot; and a plaque commemorating his valorous actions was installed on the side of a building opposite the Place du Canada on the street that bears his name.

Cairns has several buildings and locations named after him in his hometown of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, including Hugh Cairns V.C. School (an elementary school that opened in 1960), the Hugh Cairns V.C. Armoury, and the Footballer&#x27;s Memorial, a statue of Cairns in Kinsmen Park. The school is located on Cairns Avenue, however the street was not named for Hugh Cairns, but rather for Saskatoon pioneer John Cairns.

<text>Greenstone is a suite of software tools for building and distributing digital library collections on the Internet or CD-ROM. It is open-source, multilingual software, issued under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Greenstone is produced by the New Zealand Digital Library Project at the University of Waikato, and has been developed and distributed in cooperation with UNESCO and the Human Info NGO in Belgium.

The developers of Greenstone received the International Federation for Information Processing&#x27;s 2004 Namur Award for &quot;contributions to the awareness of social implications of information technology, and the need for an holistic approach in the use of information technology that takes account of social implications.&quot;

Greenstone may be used to create large, searchable collections of digital documents. In addition to command line tools for digital collection building, Greenstone has a graphical Greenstone Librarians Interface (GLI) used to build collections and assign metadata.

Through user selected plugins, Greenstone can import digital documents in formats including text, html, jpg, tiff, MP3, PDF, video, and Word, among others. The text, PDF, HTML and similar documents are converted into Greenstone Archive Format (GAF) which is an XML equivalent format.

A project on SourceForge was created in October 2005 for version 3 of Greenstone.
In 2010, Greenstone version 2.83 was included, along with the Koha Integrated Library System, in an Ubuntu Live-Cd.

<text>Classic Gold was a network of three &quot;Gold&quot; music formatted stations which broadcast on AM in Bradford, Hull and Sheffield. They were the sister stations of Pennine Radio, Viking Radio and Radio Hallam respectively and they were part of the Yorkshire Radio Network.

==History==
On 31 October 1988, Viking Radio split its frequencies and turned its medium wave service into &quot;Viking Gold&quot;, thereby becoming Yorkshire Radio Network&#x27;s first oldies station. Pennine and Hallam soon followed and Classic Gold launched on 1 May 1989.

For most of its life, Classic Gold was produced with a presenter in Hull, and local &#x27;tech-ops&#x27; in Bradford and Sheffield. In Bradford two sets of adverts would be played out - one for Bradford and one for the Halifax/Huddersfield transmitter. 
Tech-ops were instructed by talk-back from the presenter studio in Hull what the &#x27;out-cue&#x27; was going to be. Part of the tech-op&#x27;s duties was to drive the desk for the news readers - the first three minutes of which were taken by the FM station, while Classic Gold listeners got a full five minutes of news. 

A stand-by CD was in satellite studios in case of line failure; in Bradford, Nina Simone&#x27;s My Baby Just Cares for Me meant the line had gone dead.

In the early 1990s GWR Group, which had just bought 2CR and 210, took YRN&#x27;s Classic Gold from midnight until 6am. The name was used in Yorkshire by YRN some 12 months before the GWR Group.

After being taken over by the Metro Radio Group in the early 90s, Classic Gold was relaunched as &quot;Great Yorkshire Radio&quot;, and in 1993 as &quot;Great Yorkshire Gold&quot;. The station continued in all three areas, even after the sale of the Bradford-based station (along with its FM sister station The Pulse of West Yorkshire) to the Radio Partnership in 1996 due to Radio Authority rules at the time prevented the new owner from owning stations in both Leeds and Bradford due to the significant overlap.

In 1997, promotional trailers began running across all three Great Yorkshire Gold stations saying that they would be soon changing to become Magic, despite the fact that this would not be the case in West Yorkshire, where negotiations were underway to take GWR plc&#x27;s Classic Gold service. Unhappy with the confusion being caused to listeners, bosses in Bradford decided to create an emergency local service whilst the talks continued with GWR plc and 1278 and 1530 AM West Yorkshire ran for a couple of weeks before GWR&#x27;s Classic Gold was put to air. The Classic Gold brand continued in West Yorkshire until 2007 (apart from a brief period when the station became Big AM), when it was rebranded as Pulse Gold taking programming from the GCap-owned &quot;Gold&quot; network; being relaunched again the following year (2008) as Pulse 2, which remained on air until 1 September 2020 when the station was replaced with a relay of Bauer-owned Greatest Hits Radio.

==Programming==
Each station had its own, local breakfast show presenter - in Bradford it was Roger Kirk, in Hull it was Chris Bell and in Sheffield it was Gerry Kersey.

Network programming began at 9.00am, with Alan Ross on mornings, and Keith Skues on lunchtimes. Peter Fairhead was also a regular presenter. Local programmes took over after Drivetime at 7.00pm, with sports programmes and specialist music. For example, on the West Yorkshire frequencies in 1989 there were brass band programmes, cookery descriptions, old dance music, computer technology shows and &#x27;music from the hippy era&#x27; presented by Nigel Schofield.

Weekends included a large amount of local programming which on Saturdays included the breakfast show with Terry Pierce and Kenelm James and the morning show with Brian Cooke and Gregory Sammons, Sundays included religious programming with local clergy (Bradford had Martin Short and Daniel Croft as two of their presenters), and sports programming, including rugby league with Iain Williamson and football with Chris Cooper and Dan Aykroyd.

==Branding==
The Classic Gold jingles were re-sings of classic PAMS jingles, making the station sound more like an offshore pirate of the 60s - a sound familiar to Programme Director Keith Skues - himself a veteran of Radio Caroline and Radio London. The station even had its own version of the &quot;Sonovox waltz&quot; as used by Radio London, this was heard usually every hour just before the news. Alan Ross researched &#x27;Oldies Radio&#x27; and the use of jingles, by studying the output of &#x27;Cool 105.9&#x27; - a Solid Gold radio station based in Florida.

The Great Yorkshire Radio jingles were re-sings of the Great North Radio package produced by Alfasound, they also used the same slogans. (40 Years of Hits) At this time the station logo used the same font style as its sister station GNR too.

<doc id="1219149" wikidata="Q6923852" url="?curid=1219149" title="Mount Stephen">
<text>Mount Stephen, , is a mountain located in the Kicking Horse River Valley of Yoho National Park, km east of Field, British Columbia, Canada. The mountain was named in 1886 for George Stephen, the first president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The mountain is mainly composed of shales and dolomites from the Cambrian Period, some 550 million years ago. The Stephen Formation, a stratigraphical unit of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin was first described at the mountain and was named for it. Stephen has a subpeak known as Stephen SE1, at the end of a 1 km ridge, 132° from the main peak, visible from Lake O&#x27;Hara.

== Climbing ==
The first ascent was made on September 9, 1887 by James. J. McArthur and his assistant T. Riley, which was made even more difficult by the surveying equipment they also carried with them. Unfortunately for them, smoke from forest fires limited visibility from the top. Beginning at 4:30 am, it took them four hours to pierce dense forest to reach tree line. After another three hours, the final rocks were reached which bore the inscription &quot;Hill, Whatley, Ross, September 6, 1886&quot;. Above the rocks, they had to navigate an ice couloir and a knife-edged arete before reaching the summit. Sometime between this ascent and one in 1892, an estimated of rock had fallen in the upper section of the mountain, making the climb notably easier.

The main route (a scramble) ascends slopes on the southwest face but requires much route finding and the final section of to the top is rated difficult. A cornice on the summit may prevent parties from reaching the top so if in doubt of conditions, attempts should wait until August. The route also passes through a fossil bed and thus requires a special park permit to be in the area. The elevation gain is .

For rock climbers, a route on the north ridge is rated III 5.7 with generally good rock formations composed mainly of quartzite.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Stephen is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C. Weather conditions during winter make Mount Stephen one of the better places in the Rockies for ice climbing. Precipitation runoff from Mount Stephen drains into the Kicking Horse River.
