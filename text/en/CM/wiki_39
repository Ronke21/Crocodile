<text>West Midlands Police is the territorial police force responsible for policing the metropolitan county of West Midlands in England.

The force covers an area of with 2.93million inhabitants, which includes the cities of Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton and also the Black Country. In 2020, there were 6,846 officers, 484 police community support officers (PCSO), and 219 volunteer special constables.

The force is led by Chief Constable Craig Guildford. The force area is divided into ten Local Policing Units (LPUs), each being served by four core policing teams – Response, Neighbourhood, Investigation and Community Action &amp; Priority (CAPT) – with the support of a number of specialist crime teams. These specialist teams include CID, traffic and a firearms unit.

West Midlands Police is a partner, alongside Staffordshire Police, in the Central Motorway Police Group. The force is party to a number of other resource sharing agreements including the National Police Air Service.

==History==
===Regional policing in the West Midlands prior to 1974===

Prior to the formation of West Midlands Police as it is known today, the area now covered by the force was served by a total of six smaller constabularies. These constabularies were as follows:
*Birmingham City Police 1839–1974: Established in 1839 following an outbreak of Chartist rioting that the Metropolitan Police had to help quell, officers from Birmingham City Police first took to the streets on 20 November of that year. Initially with a strength of 260 officers paid at a rate of 17 shillings a week, the constabulary expanded to keep pace with the growth of the city with the final areas to be added before the force&#x27;s amalgamation in West Midlands Police being the Hollywood area. 
*Coventry Police 1836–1974: Formed with the Municipal Corporations Act in 1836, Coventry Police was initially only twenty officers with the support of a single sergeant and one inspector. The force reached a strength of 137 officers by 1914 and continued to grow until in 1969 it was merged with the Warwickshire and Coventry Constabulary, part of which it remained until the formation of West Midlands Police. 
*Dudley Borough Police 1920–1966: Formerly part of the Worcestershire Constabulary, Dudley gained its own police force on 1 April 1920 following a review by His Majesty&#x27;s Inspector that had suggested previous policing arrangements were unsatisfactory. Dudley Borough Police remained independent until the Royal Commission in 1960 which resulted in its inclusion as part of the newly formed West Midlands Constabulary.
*Walsall Borough Police 1832–1966: Moving away from a &#x27;watch&#x27; system, Walsall Borough Police were formed on 6 July 1832 with an initial strength of only one superintendent and three constables. As with the other regional forces, Walsall Borough Police expanded with the area&#x27;s population and in 1852 appointed its first two detectives. The force took on its first female recruits in 1918 and in the 1960s became one of the first forces to issues its officers with personal radios. As with Dudley&#x27;s police force, Walsall Borough Police became part of the West Midlands Constabulary following the Royal Commission. 
*West Midlands Constabulary 1966–1974: Lasting only eight years, West Midlands Constabulary was a newly formed force encompassing a number of smaller borough forces including Dudley Borough Police, Walsall Borough Police, Wolverhampton Borough Police and parts of Staffordshire and Worcestershire Constabularies. The creation of the West Midlands Constabulary was the consequence of 1960&#x27;s Royal Commission into policing.
*Wolverhampton Borough Police 1837–1966: The formation of Wolverhampton Borough Police was approved on 3 August 1837 under the condition that the strength of the force not exceed sixteen men. The Police Act 1839 saw Staffordshire County Police taking over policing in Wolverhampton with Wolverhampton Borough Police regaining responsibility for policing the town in 1848. At the turn of the 20th century the force was 109 strong, reaching a highpoint of around 300 before the force became part of the short lived West Midlands Constabulary in 1966.

===Establishment of West Midlands Police===

West Midlands Police was formed on 1 April 1974, owing to the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 which created the new West Midlands metropolitan county. It was formed by merging the Birmingham City Police, the earlier West Midlands Constabulary, and parts of Staffordshire County and Stoke-on-Trent Constabulary, Warwickshire and Coventry Constabulary and West Mercia Constabulary. The first Chief Constable appointed to the new force was Sir Derrick Capper, the last Chief Constable of Birmingham Police.

===Controversies and allegations of corruption===
Between 1974 and 1989, the force operated the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad. It was disbanded after allegations of endemic misconduct, leading to a series of unsafe convictions. These included allegations that officers had falsified confessions in witness statements, denied suspects access to solicitors and used torture such as &quot;plastic bagging&quot; to partially suffocate suspects in order to extract confessions. They were alleged to have abused payments to informers. A series of around 40 prosecutions failed in the late 1980s as defendants showed that evidence had or may have been tampered with. West Yorkshire Police led an investigation which led to a small number of internal disciplinary proceedings, but did not recommend any prosecutions for lack of evidence. However, over 60 convictions secured from their investigations have now been quashed, including those of the Birmingham Six.

West Midlands Police had two serious firearms incidents, in 1980 and 1985. In 1980, David Pagett held his pregnant girlfriend as hostage while resisting arrest by the police. Officers returned fire, and shot her. Police had initially tried to claim that Pagett has shot her, but it became clear that it was police bullets that had caused her death. In 1985, John Shorthouse was arrested by West Midlands police for questioning about armed robberies in South Wales. His house was then searched. His five-year-old son, John, was shot by police searching under the child&#x27;s bed. An internal inquiry was held, and as a result, use of firearms was restricted to a specialised and trained unit.

Allegations of bribery and corruption were made in 1994 by &quot;World in Action&quot;, an investigative current affairs TV programme. The convicted criminal David Harris alleged that West Midlands police officers had demanded payments of more than £200,000 to keep criminals including himself away from prosecutions. Other allegations from police officers focused on officers attempting to persuade others to accept bribes. The CID was the focus of an investigation by Leicestershire Police at the request of the Police Complaints Authority.

===2000s and onwards===
Under proposals announced by the then Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, on 6 February 2006, West Midlands Police would have merged with Staffordshire Police, West Mercia Constabulary and Warwickshire Constabulary to form a single strategic force for the West Midlands region.
This, along with a number of other mergers which would have cut the number of forces in England and Wales from 43 to 24, were abandoned in July 2006 after widespread opposition from police and the public.

Because of prison overcrowding in October 2006, up to 44 prison cells at Steelhouse Lane police station in Birmingham were made available to house inmates as part of Operation Safeguard and in accordance with an agreement between West Midlands Police and HM Prison Service.

In October 2008, the Chief Constable Sir Paul Scott-Lee announced he would not be renewing his contract in May 2009, after seven years in the post. His replacement was Chris Sims.

The force attracted controversy in 2010 when Project Champion, a £3million scheme to install a network of CCTV cameras in the predominantly Muslim areas of Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook, came under fire from local residents and civil rights organisations. A total of 218 cameras had been planned for installation but the project was abandoned following concerns over their legality and objections from residents and local councillors that they had not been consulted by the force.

Between April and September 2010, WMP budgets were cut by £3.4million as part of a programme to reduce spending by £50M over four years. In response to the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review, Chief Constable Sims said WMP would need to reduce spending by up to £123million over the same period.

In 2010, the force implemented regulation A19, requiring officers with 30 or more years service to retire, in response to government funding cuts. The regulation, used by 15 forces to make emergency savings, led to 591 WMP officers being forced to retire. Some of these officers later took WMP to an employment tribunal, alleging age discrimination. In 2014 the tribunal found the regulation to be unlawful. In 2015, 498 former WMP officers were seeking compensation. The ruling was later overturned by the Employment Appeal Tribunal, whose decision was upheld in the Court of Appeal in 2017.

Plans to privatise parts of the force were halted by Bob Jones, the force&#x27;s first Police and Crime Commissioner, upon taking office in 2012.

Chief Constable Chris Sims was reappointed to a second three-year term in 2013, then stepped down at the beginning of 2016. He was succeeded by Dave Thompson, who had previously been Deputy Chief Constable.

In March 2021, Oliver Banfield, a probationary officer with West Midlands Police, was convicted of assault by beating after using techniques taught in police training to attack a woman while off-duty. Banfield was sentenced to a 14-week curfew and ordered to pay £500 compensation to his victim. Former Leader of the Opposition Harriet Harman described the fact Banfield did not receive a custodial sentence as “proof ... that [the] system fails women and protects men”. After the conviction, the Crown Prosecution Service apologised for initially declining to charge Banfield. In a May 2021 hearing, Banfield was found guilty of gross misconduct and banned from policing for life.

A 2021 investigation by &quot;Newsnight&quot; and &quot;The Law Society Gazette&quot; found that alleged hate crimes in which the victim was a police officer were significantly more likely to result in a successful prosecution across a number of force areas including the West Midlands. The investigation found that in the year ending March 2020, crimes against police officers and staff constituted 7 percent of hate incidents recorded by West Midlands Police, but resulted in 43 percent of hate crimes convictions. In March 2022, a WMP constable resigned after having been found to have fabricated the death of a partner in order to receive bereavement leave and other benefits; Chief Constable Thompson said the officer would have been dismissed for gross misconduct had he not resigned.

In November 2023, His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary placed West Midlands police under &quot;special measures&quot;, and the force&#x27;s monitoring level was enhanced, as it was &quot;not effectively addressing the inspectorate&#x27;s concerns&quot;. The inspectors reported that the force was not carrying out investigations effectively or managing the public&#x27;s risk from known sex offenders. The chief constable and West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Foster said they completely disagreed with the decision.

==Leadership and performance==
, West Midlands Police was smaller than at any previous time in its history, having lost nearly 2,300 officers since 2010. Government funding for West Midlands Police fell by £145M since 2010. In 2018, Chief Constable Dave Thompson said that falling numbers of police officers due to funding cuts, and a &quot;wider spread of crime&quot;, prevented the police doing everything the public want or expect of them.

===Leadership===
The current chief constable is Craig Guildford, and the deputy chief constable is Scott Green.

==== Chief constables ====

* Sir Derrick Capper (1974–1975)
* Philip Knights (1975–1985)
* Sir Geoffrey Dear (1985–1990)
* Sir Ron Hadfield (1990–1996)
* Sir Edward Crewe (1996–2002)
* Sir Paul Scott-Lee (2002–2009)
* Chris Sims (1 June 2009 January 2016)
* Sir Dave Thompson (January 2016 December 2022)
* Craig Guildford (December 2022 present)

===Police and Crime Commissioner===

The West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), established in 2012 as one of several directly-elected police and crime commissioners is responsible for oversight and accountability for WMP and appoints the chief constable. , the current PCC is Simon Foster. 

The West Midlands PCC replaces the West Midlands Police Authority, which was founded in 1996. Before it was replaced, the chair of the West Midlands Police Authority was Bishop Dr Derek Webley, of the New Testament Church of God in Handsworth, the first non-politician member of Authority to be elected chair, and the first African Caribbean chair of any police authority in the United Kingdom.

===Crime statistics and budget===

The following table shows the percentage of cases resulting in a criminal charge or court summons in West Midlands Police&#x27;s jurisdiction, by offence group, for the period from April 2020 to March 2021:

Dave Thompson stated that unforeseen pensions expenses of £8.6M in 2019 and £13.9M in 2020, from a budget of £514M cost roughly as much as 500 officers and would lower the total number of officers to 6,000, contrasted with 8,600 in 2010. Thompson added, “There is no question there will be more obvious rationing of services. The public can already see it is going on. We are already not pursuing crimes where we could find a suspect. We are doing things now that surprise me. We are struggling to deliver a service to the public. I think criminals are well aware now how stretched we are. These further cuts will leave us smaller than we have ever been. There is unquestionably more demand than there was in 1974.”

In the 2021/22 financial year, West Midlands Police&#x27;s budget was £655.6M, an increase from £619.7M in 2020/21.

==Structure and departments==

West Midlands Police covers an area of with 2.93million inhabitants, which includes the cities of Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton and also the Black Country. 
, the force has 6,846 police officers, 219 special constables, and 467 police community support officers (PCSO), 165 police support volunteers (PSV), and 3,704 staff.
In 2019, 10.9% of officers were from a BAME background, compared with 8.5% in 2014.

===Local Policing Areas===

The area covered by West Midlands Police is divided into seven Local Policing Areas (LPAs). Each LPU is headed by a chief superintendent, responsible for the overall policing and management of the area, supported by a Local Command Team (LCT) composed of a varying number of superintendents and chief inspectors.

Each LPA has a number of dedicated Neighbourhood Policing teams. These cover a specific area and are headed by a sergeant with support from a number of police officers, PCSOs and sometimes special constables. The force operates a number of police stations.

===Core policing teams===

West Midlands Police is structured in such a way that there are a number of key teams in each LPA who have the responsibility for dealing with everyday policing duties. The force&#x27;s current structure was gradually introduced over the past two years with the Solihull and Birmingham South LPUs being the first area to see the change in June 2011, and the Walsall LPU being the last in January 2013. The structural change was introduced as part of the force&#x27;s &#x27;Continuous Improvement&#x27; programme with the ambition of working in a more cost effective and efficient manner and was overseen under the advice of accounting firm KPMG.

Prior to Continuous Improvement, the force had operated with larger response and neighbourhood teams and smaller teams allocated to prisoner handling roles. Community action and priority teams were a new addition to the force&#x27;s structure under Continuous Improvement.

The core policing teams are:

====Priority Crime Teams (PCT)====
The &#x27;PCT&#x27; support neighbourhood officers to address local issues and resource demands for service not met by other departments. They can be allocated to neighbourhoods suffering particular issues, for example anti-social behaviour, and are also often public order trained, so are used for policing football matches, demonstrations and similar occasions. As with the investigation teams, the community action and priority teams are supervised by a sergeant, who reports to an inspector.

Key responsibilities of community action and priority teams are as follows:
* Supporting neighbourhood teams – Providing specialist support to Neighbourhood Teams for example, conducting drugs warrants or addressing anti-social behaviour.
* Addressing local issues – Supporting other front line policing teams and completing tasking as directed by LPU local command teams
* Providing support for abstractions – Resourcing abstractions such as football matches, demonstrations and similar incidents so that Neighbourhood officers are able to focus on their beats.

====Investigation teams====
Officers on investigation teams have three main responsibilities, these being secondary investigation, prisoner handling and attending scheduled appointments with the public. These officers are also responsible for completing prosecution files and other paperwork necessary for taking cases to court. Investigation teams are split into a number of shifts, each supervised by a sergeant, and will have an inspector supervising the sergeants.

Key responsibilities of investigation teams are as follows:
* Secondary investigation – Following initial attendance of incidents by Response Team officers, investigations are allocated to investigation teams who conduct any follow up enquiries that are required.
* Prisoner handling – Offenders arrested by response and neighbourhood officers are handed to investigation teams who will interview and retain ownership of the investigation up to the point of its conclusion. 
* Scheduled response – Operating on a diary system, investigation team officers attend pre-booked slots with members of the public who are wanting to report none urgent matters.

====Neighbourhood teams====

Aligned to specific neighbourhoods, these officers seek to tackle long term issues affecting local areas and attend community meetings. There are 171 neighbourhoods across the West Midlands, and officers assigned to neighbourhood teams are often supported by PCSOs and special constables. It is not uncommon for busier areas, such as town centres, to have several neighbourhood teams such as the St. Matthews beat covering Walsall town centre, which has two teams. Neighbourhood teams usually have a single sergeant who reports to a sector inspector.

====Response====
Response officers work in shifts around the clock answering the most urgent calls for service received through the force&#x27;s call centres. It is not unusual for response officers to work alone and each response shift usually has a number of officers who are authorised to carry Taser. In addition to Taser, some response officers also carry mobile fingerprint ID machines to confirm identities at the roadside. Response officers undergo enhanced driving training and also have a range of other skills required to perform their role including &#x27;method of entry&#x27; training so that they can force entry into premises. Many response officers are also public order trained in order to respond to spontaneous disorder should it occur. Response teams are supervised by a number of sergeants and an inspector.

Key responsibilities of response teams are as follows:
* Primary investigation – Attending incidents in the first instance, Response officers gather available evidence and record offences. Follow up enquiries are then allocated to the investigation teams.
* Missing person enquiries – Response officers conduct investigations into missing persons with a low or medium risk assessment.
* Traffic – Officers from response teams attend reported road traffic accidents, sometimes supporting force traffic in the case of serious collisions.

===Specialist crime teams===

The core policing teams are supported by, and work closely with, a number of specialist crime teams. West Midlands Police had a mounted division which was disbanded in 1999 to divert funds elsewhere. Current specialist crime teams include:

====Air operations====


Air operations in the force&#x27;s area have been provided by the National Police Air Service since 2012. 
Previously, the Midlands Air Operations Unit was a consortium of West Midlands, Warwickshire, West Mercia and Staffordshire Police based at Birmingham Airport. It operated from July 1987,
until it was replaced by the After experimenting, since the 1970s, with civilian helicopters hired on an occasional basis, West Midlands Police launched their own air unit on 10 May 1989. A WMP helicopter was destroyed by arson in June 2009, while at Birmingham Airport.

====Airport policing====

The West Midlands Police force area includes Birmingham Airport which is on the Solihull LPA.
The airport has a dedicated airports policing team assigned who work closely with Border Force customs and immigration officers. Officers working at the airport have additional powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 as the airport is &quot;designated&quot; under the terms of the Act and some are armed.

====Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG)====
West Midlands Police is one of the two police forces who contribute officers to the Central Motorway Police Group, the other being Staffordshire Police. CMPG operate out of three main bases, the main headquarters being under the M6 motorway at Perry Barr at which their central control room and vehicle depot is situated. CMPG also have a regional control centre in Quinton, Birmingham shared with National Highways. Officers attached to CMPG cover a wide geographical area, including in the West Midlands the M6, M54 and A45.

====Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM)====
Based in Birmingham, Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) is responsible for co-ordinating the force&#x27;s counter-terrorism activity. CTPWM works under the guidance of the Government&#x27;s national counter terrorism strategy, CONTEST, with the aims of pursuing terrorists, protecting the public, preparing for a possible attack and preventing terrorism by working in the community to address the causes of terrorist activity.

====Dog Section====

Most dogs in the West Midlands Police Dog Section are products of an in-house breeding program which the force has been running at its Balsall Common training centre since 1994.

Specialist search dogs including Springer Spaniels and Labradors are also used by the Dogs Unit to locate drugs or firearms and explosives. Dogs are continually recruited from rescue centres and from members of the public. All specialist dogs are handled by officers who already have a general purpose police dog, giving the handler responsibility in both training and operational deployment.

Prior to 2013 there were 69 operational dog handlers working in West Midlands Police, dogs underwent an initial training program lasting twelve weeks. Officers with the Dog Section patrol in specially adapted Skoda patrol vehicles with air conditioned cages capable of carrying up to three dogs in the rear and operate from bases at Aston, Canley and Wednesbury.

====Events planning and football====
The events planning department has responsibility for co-ordinating large-scale events taking place within the force area and also for ensuring that officers are available should they be required to support other regional forces through mutual aid arrangements. One major responsibility of the department is organising the policing operation for the Autumn political party conferences that are often held at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham. Included within this department also is the Football Unit who coordinate policing of football games within the West Midlands and operate a team of &quot;spotters&quot; to identify violent supporters and banned individuals.

The policing of large-scale events such as football matches, VIP visits and public demonstrations can be coordinated from the force&#x27;s Events Control Suite (ECS) at the Tally Ho facility in Birmingham. The ECS is able to receive live CCTV footage and has computer facilities for the use of partner agencies with whom the suite is shared.

====Firearms====

West Midlands Police operate a number of armed response vehicles (ARVs) that patrol the region and respond to incidents typically involving guns, knives or dangerous dogs. Officers undertake a ten-week selection process to join the firearms unit with courses being delivered on weapons, tactics and advanced driving.

Alongside attending firearms incidents, officers attached to the firearms unit also provide tactical advice when planning operations and give lectures on firearms awareness to officers and members of the public. The force also has a Firearms Licensing Department which is responsible for the issue of shotgun and firearms certificates to members of the public and explosives certificates to companies requiring them.

====Major Crime Unit====
Detached from the LPAs, Major Crime is staffed by officers holding a detective qualification and investigate serious and complicated crimes not taken on by Local CID or other departments. Such offences include murders, serious assaults, firearms incidents and kidnap. Major Crime is arranged into a series of investigation teams including a dedicated Homicide Unit, working from bases at Harborne and Aston.

Working within Major Crime are a series of Payback Teams who are responsible for arranging asset seizures and confiscations under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. During 2011 offenders were forced to pay back £6.3M from proceeds of crime, a 39% increase on the previous year.

====Force traffic====
Based at Park Lane, Chelmsley Wood and Wednesbury, the force traffic unit has responsibility for roads policing on all roads inside the West Midlands other than the motorways which are covered by the Central Motorways Policing Group. Officers from the force traffic unit usually hold advanced driving grades and have access to marked and unmarked vehicles, including BMWs and Audis fitted with evidential video recording equipment. Force Traffic is supported by a Collision Investigation Unit based at Aston Police Station who investigate accidents involving fatalities or life-changing injuries.

====Forensic scene investigators (FSI)====

Officers are supported by a team of around 100 civilian forensics scene investigators who attend crime scenes and examine seized items to obtain forensic evidence for use in court. Formerly known as scenes of crime officers (SOCO), scene investigators have access to a wide range of specialist equipment to help with their role and alongside gathering forensic samples; they also are responsible for crime scene photography.

====Intelligence unit====
West Midlands Police has dedicated intelligence cells based on each LPU who collate and disseminate information collected by officers from a range of other sources. This role involves &quot;sanitising&quot; intelligence logs and forwarding them on to relevant persons, receiving information from outside sources such as Crimestoppers, and assisting with the progression of investigations.

The intelligence unit is responsible for organising briefing material for officers and police leadership; they also include a covert operations unit, who coordinate undercover policing operations under the terms of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA).

West Midlands Police is a partner alongside Warwickshire Police, West Mercia Police and Staffordshire Police in the Regional Intelligence Unit collaborative working agreement under which information is shared between the forces on serious and organised criminals affecting the West Midlands Region.

====Integrated emergency management (IEM)====

The Operations Integrated Emergency Management service is responsible for ensuring that the force is ready to respond to major incidents, that business continuity plans are in place and that the force&#x27;s duty under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 is satisfied. This work includes running exercises and drills to test readiness and working closely with other emergency services and local authorities. As part of the service&#x27;s work, the force also maintains a number of Casualty Bureau facilities at which calls from the public are taken and collated following a major incident such as a plane crash or terrorist attack.

====Local CID====

Each LPU has a Local CID team of officers who hold a detective qualification and conduct secondary investigations into serious offences that occur within their area. Offences that fall under the remit of Local CID include burglary of dwellings, personal robberies, frauds and some vehicle crime.

====Offender management unit (OMU)====

All LPAs have an offender management unit (OMU) who work with partner agencies to concentrate on the offenders living on their areas identified as being particularly difficult or damaging. Offenders who fall into this category include those designated as prolific and other priority offenders (PPOs), drug users, violent criminals and young criminals.

Officers from the OMU manage their assigned PPOs under two strands. One consists of rehabilitation and resettlement under which partner agencies are involved in an effort to halt re-offending whilst the other consists of catching and convicting offenders who have been identified as not participating in rehabilitation programmes or are wanted for outstanding crimes.

====Operational support unit (OSU)====

Working from Park Lane the operational support unit is a team of officers specially trained in areas including Public Order policing, method of entry and searching. Officers working with the OSU are typically deployed as part of a &quot;serial&quot; of one sergeant and seven officers and have access to specialist equipment and vehicles including armoured land rovers.

====Public protection unit (PPU)====

The public protection unit (PPU) investigates reports of sexual assaults and incidents involving children and vulnerable people. PPU is split between adult and child investigations, is responsible for safeguarding and works with partner agencies such as social services and domestic violence charities. As with CID, most officers working in the PPU hold a detective qualification.

====Safer travel====

The safer travel team is a collaboration between West Midlands Police, the British Transport Police and CENTRO, focusing on criminal activity occurring on the public transport network. The team is composed of officers and PCSOs who patrol trains, buses and trams in the region.

The Partnership, the first of its type in the country, also has access to around 1,000 CCTV cameras which are located at bus, rail and metro stations, park and ride sites and in bus shelters. The dedicated control centre is staffed 24 hours a day to spot and respond to incidents.

===Professional standards department (PSD)===
Based at Lloyd House, the professional standards department (PSD) is responsible for the recording and assessment of public complaints about police officers, police staff or special constables. PSD also has a role in investigating serious reports of misconduct and corruption involving members of the force.

Members of the public are eligible to make a complaint if the behaviour about which they want to complain was directed towards them, if they were &quot;adversely affected&quot; by said behaviour or if they were an eyewitness to said behaviour. A person is &quot;adversely affected&quot; if they suffer any form of loss or damage, distress or inconvenience, if they are put in danger or are otherwise unduly put at risk of being adversely affected.

PSD work alongside the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), to whom they will refer the most serious allegations.

Where appropriate, PSD have a range of outcomes following disciplinary panels, including no action, counselling (management advice), written warning, transfer to another post, withholding increments and dismissal.

West Midlands Police recorded 501 complaints for 2018/19, a 36 percent drop in comparison to 2017/18 during which 777 complaints were recorded.

===Press Office===
Also known as Corporate Communications, the West Midlands Police Press Office is centralised at headquarters and is charged with representing the force&#x27;s public image. Each LPU has dedicated Territorial Communications officers and in addition to addressing media enquiries, the Press Office also looks after the force&#x27;s website and publishes the force&#x27;s internal online newspaper, &quot;News Beat&quot;.

====Social media====
West Midlands Police maintains a presence on social media websites including Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube and blogging platforms.

Several of the force&#x27;s social media accounts have won recognition as examples of best practice, including Solihull Police&#x27;s Twitter feed which came first place in the 2012 Golden Twits&#x27; Customer Service category and Inspector Brown&#x27;s Mark Hanson Digital Media Award 2012 for his mental health blog.

===Special constabulary===

Officers belonging to the special constabulary have the same powers as full-time officers and are unpaid volunteers, giving a minimum of sixteen hours a month of duty time.

After initial training special constables are deployed wearing the same street uniform as other officers. They can be identified as Specials by their collar numbers, which start with 7 and the &#x27;SC&#x27; on their epaulettes.

Special constables provide West Midlands Police with around 96,000 hours of voluntary duty each year and usually work alongside regular officers on neighbourhood teams, response teams and also Community Action &amp; Priority Teams.

==PEEL inspection==
Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, West Midlands Police was rated as follows:

==Recruitment and training==
Applicants to join West Midlands Police as police officers are subject to a staged recruitment process designed to assess their suitability for the role, including background checks, medical and fitness tests.

On being accepted to join the force, new recruits undergo an initial training course last eighteen weeks which is non-residential and based mainly in the classroom but with periodic practical exercises and attachments. Performance is assessed by a series of examinations and training includes self-defence lessons and tuition on police computer systems. Following successful completion of initial training, recruits are then tutored on their LPUs for nine weeks before being signed off for independent patrol. They retain their status as student officers for a period of two years from their joining date during which they are required to maintain a record of their development. Upon reaching two years service, student officers are &quot;confirmed&quot; in their rank by a senior officer, usually their LPU commander.

The recruitment process for PCSOs is similar to that of police officers although training periods are reduced.

In November 2018 it emerged that the police force had blocked white male officers from promotion, setting aside half of all promotion slots for women and ethnic minority candidates in seven out of eight of the year&#x27;s promotion rounds. In the year&#x27;s final round the force continued to discriminate, by blocking white male applicants for two days. A complaint by the Police Federation union noted that the practice was illegal and condemned it as &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. As a result West Midlands Police &quot;paused&quot; the practice.

On 11 June 2020, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson committed to ensuring that the force recruits 1,000 new Black, Asian and minority ethnic police officers over the following three years to make the force look more like the communities it serves.

==Presentation==

Police officers working for West Midlands Police have a wide range of different uniforms, equipment and vehicles dependent on their specific roles.

===Uniform===

Officers&#x27; standard street uniform consists of black lightweight zip-up shirts, black trousers and a high visibility protective vest. White shirts were replaced by the black T-shirts in 2010 at a cost of £100,000 but are retained for court and station duties. Officers are issued with fleeces, weatherproof pullovers, fluorescent jackets, high visibility tabards, waterproof over trousers and slash resistant gloves.

====Ranks and epaulettes====

Shoulder insignia for ranks above police constable are as follows:

When dressed for public order policing, officers wear coloured epaulettes indicating their respective roles. Bronze commanders wear yellow epaulettes, inspectors wear red epaulettes, sergeants wear white epaulettes, tactical advisors wear blue epaulettes, medics wear green epaulettes and evidence gathering officers have orange epaulettes.

===Equipment===
As part of standard issue Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), officers carry Sepura TETRA radios, rigid handcuffs, PAVA spray and an extendible friction lock baton. Officers also have access to first aid kits, limb restraints and torches.

Traffic units, particularly officers performing collision investigation duties, use laser plotting devices to accurately survey collision sights and carry devices that can be used to measure road friction and deceleration values.

==Facilities==
As of 2021, there are 11 police stations, with a front desk in the West Midlands Police force area, including Lloyd House in Birmingham, the force headquarters. There are also two &#x27;superblock&#x27; custody suites in the West Midlands.

The NPAS helicopter operates from a base at Birmingham Airport in Solihull.

Large scale policing demonstrations such as protest marches and football matches were coordinated from the Events Control Suite (ECS) in Birmingham. Since that time the force has built a new purpose built Command Centre which contains the Force Control Room as well as hosting a number of other departments.

Public Order courses are hosted at the regional training centre which consists of a converted aircraft hangar on the RAF Cosford site near Telford. The site has facilities allowing officers to experience riot situations including dealing with &#x27;Emotionally Disturbed Person&#x27; scenarios during which they are subject to attacks by role playing actors wielding weapons.

West Midlands Police operate a Custody Visiting Scheme under which independent representatives from local communities are able to access detention facilities to observe, comment and report upon the welfare and treatment of detained persons. Visits are conducted at random by volunteers working in pairs who then write a report on the feedback gathered during their visit.

In 2017 a joint inspection of the force&#x27;s custody suites was conducted by HMIC and Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons.

==West Midlands Police Federation==

The West Midlands Police Federation is a part of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which is the representative body for every police officer below the rank of superintendent. Representatives of the Federation are elected for three year terms and must be serving police officers.

Police officers are restricted by their regulations from striking and from taking part in active politics, hence the Federation represents their interests and negotiates on their behalf in relation to pay, conditions and pensions.

The Federation is funded by a monthly subscription paid from officers&#x27; salaries and provides representation and advice to officers who are subject to disciplinary processes.

==West Midlands Police Benevolent Fund==

The West Midlands Police Benevolent Fund was set up in 1974 following the amalgamation of local forces to form West Midlands Police. The fund is financed by subscriptions from members and donations and monies are distributed on application to the committee to members suffering financial hardship.

<doc id="1205661" wikidata="Q482506" url="?curid=1205661" title="M1917 Browning machine gun">
<text>The M1917 Browning machine gun is a heavy machine gun used by the United States armed forces in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War; it has also been used by other nations. It was a crew-served, belt-fed, water-cooled machine gun that served alongside the much lighter air-cooled Browning M1919. It was used at the battalion level, and often mounted on vehicles (such as a jeep). There were two main iterations: the M1917, which was used in World War I and the M1917A1, which was used thereafter. The M1917, which was used on some aircraft as well as in a ground role, had a cyclic rate of 450 rounds per minute. The M1917A1 had a cyclic rate of 450 to 600 rounds per minute.

== Design and development ==
In 1900, John Moses Browning filed a patent for a recoil-powered automatic gun. Browning did not work on the gun again until 1910, when he built a water-cooled prototype of the 1900 design. Although the gun worked well, Browning improved the design slightly. Browning replaced side ejection with bottom ejection, added a buffer for smoother operation, replaced the hammer with a two piece firing pin, and some other minor improvements. The basic design of the gun was still the 1900 design.

The Browning is a water-cooled heavy machine gun, though some experimental versions were made that did not use a water jacket; the air-cooled M1919 was later developed as a medium machine gun. Unlike many other early machine guns, the M1917 had nothing to do with Maxim&#x27;s toggle lock design. At , it was much lighter than contemporary Maxim type guns such as the first German &quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; 08 (08/15 model: ) and the British Vickers machine gun, while still being highly reliable. The only similarities with the Maxim or Vickers are the principles of recoil operation, T-slot breechblock, &quot;pull-out&quot; belt feed, water cooling, and forward ejection. Its sliding-block locking mechanism saved weight and complexity, and was used in many previous Browning designs. The belt fed left-to-right, and the cartridges were stacked closer together than Maxim/Vickers (patterns copied by most guns later).

The Army Ordnance Department showed little interest in machine guns until war was declared in April 1917. At that time, the U.S. arsenal included only 1,100 machine guns, and most of those were outmoded. The government asked several designers to submit weapons. Browning arranged a test at the Springfield Armory in May 1917. In the first test, the weapon fired 20,000 rounds with only a few malfunctions mostly related to poorly loaded cloth belts. The reliability was exceptional, so Browning fired another 20,000 rounds through the weapon with one broken part: a broken sear at about 39,500. The Ordnance Board was impressed, but was unconvinced that the same level of performance could be achieved in a production model. Consequently, Browning used a second gun that not only duplicated the original trial, but it also fired continuously for 48 minutes and 12 seconds (over 21,000 rounds).

The Army adopted the weapon as its principal heavy machine gun, utilizing the M1906 .30-06 cartridge with a 150-grain, flat-base bullet. Production was complex as the several manufacturers producing the guns needed to establish assembly lines and create tooling. By 30 June 1918, Westinghouse had made only 2,500 and Remington had made only 1,600. By the time of the Armistice, Westinghouse had made 30,150, Remington 12,000, and Colt 600.

Until the start of World War I, the Army had used a variety of older machine guns, including the Browning-designed M1895 &quot;Potato Digger&quot;, the Maxim Gun, the Benet–Mercie M1909, and the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. Although the Model 1917 was intended to be the principal US Army heavy machine gun in the war, the Army was forced to purchase many foreign weapons—the French-produced Hotchkiss 8 mm machine gun was actually the most common heavy machine gun used by the American Expeditionary Force.

In 1926, the Browning&#x27;s rear sight was revised to incorporate scales for both the new M1 Ball (172-grain boat-tail bullet) and the M1906 (150-grain flat-base bullet) ammunition. With M1 ball, the M1917 had a maximum range of about ; with M2 ammunition, about . The rear sight had a battle sight as well as a raised leaf-type sight suitable for employment against either ground or air targets.

== Service ==
The M1917 saw limited service in the later days of World War I. Because of production delays, only about 1,200 Model 1917s saw combat in the conflict, and then only in the last 2½ months of the war. Some arrived too late for combat service. For example, the 6th Machine Gun Battalion, fighting as part of the Second Division did not exchange their Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns for Browning M1917 machine guns until 14 November, three days after the armistice. The U.S. equipped about a third of the divisions sent to France; the others were equipped equally with Hotchkiss machine guns bought from the French or the British Vickers machine guns built by Colt in the US. Where the Model 1917 did see action, its rate of fire and reliability were highly effective. The M1917 weapon system was inferior to the Vickers and Hotchkiss guns in indirect fire applications because the British and French cartridges had about 50 percent longer range than the .30-06 service cartridge used in World War I.

The Model 1917A1 was again used in the Second World War, and was primarily used with the M2 ball, tracer, and armor-piercing ammunition introduced just prior to the outbreak of hostilities. Some were supplied to the UK for use by the Home Guard since all production of the .303 Vickers were needed to resupply the equipment abandoned during the Fall of France. The M1917&#x27;s weight and bulk meant that it was generally employed as a fixed defense or as a battalion or regimental support weapon. In this latter role, the disassembled weapon was carried by machine gun squads advancing on foot, which could rapidly deploy it to support the infantry in offensive operations. At the battle of Momote Airstrip in the Admiralties, the US Army&#x27;s 5th Cavalry machine gunners killed several hundred Japanese in one night using their M1917 Brownings; one gun was left in position after the battle as a memorial to the desperate struggle.

The Model 1917 was called to service again in the Korean War. On at least one occasion, U.S. soldiers in the Korean War urinated on the gun when water-cooling had failed in the frigid temperatures of the Korean winter. The Model 1917 was slowly phased out of military service in the late-1960s in favor of the much lighter M60 machine gun chambered in the new 7.62 mm NATO cartridge.

Many of the 1917s were given to South Vietnam. The last ones in regular US service were on the machine gun infiltration course at Fort Benning, Georgia, where their sustained-fire capability was an advantage in long nights of shooting over the heads of low-crawling trainees. The gun did continue to see service in some Third World armies well into the latter half of the 20th century. Some are still in use today by irregular military forces because the water cooled barrel allows for long periods of sustained fire.

== M1917 and M1917A1 ammunition chests ==
The machine gun used a wooden ammunition chest that carried 250 rounds. The early M1917 model had an angled corner and a leather strap handle on top. The later M1917A1 model had a square corner and a cloth strap handle on top.

The wooden ammunition belt chest was replaced during WWII by the expendable metal box ammunition M1 adopted 6 May 1942. On 20 June 1945, a modified version known as the M1A1 was adopted. The M1A1 had a spring-loaded catch to fasten it to the M1917A1 tripod more securely and provide a better watertight seal. In the late-1940s the M19 box replaced the earlier metal M1 and M1A1 boxes, and a modified version known as the M19A1 appeared in the early-1950s and continues in use today.

== Variants ==
=== US military variants ===

==== M1917 ====
The original gun suffered from a weakness related to the design of the receiver. Under field conditions, the bottom plates, which were dovetailed into the gun&#x27;s two side plates, tore out. An early fix was to attach a roughly horseshoe-shaped steel bracket around the rearmost part of the receiver. A later fix was to rivet &quot;stirrups&quot; (right-angled steel pieces) to the bottom and side plates. The stirrup fix became the standard reinforcement until a more permanent fix for the problem was developed. Another reported problem was bulging in the side plates, which was probably caused by stresses put into the side plates when hammering the dovetails closed. The 1917 also had a simple sliding safety that blocked the trigger when moved to the far right position. These were removed as part of post-war refurbishment.

==== M1917A1 ====

In the 1930s, the Ordnance Department developed a new bottom plate, which had side flanges that came up on both sides of the receiver and were attached by rivets. This fixed the problem of the original bottom plates, and became standard for all M1917- and M1919-series machine guns. While the US Arsenal at Rock Island was the leader in converting the existing stocks of M1917-series guns over to 1917A1 configuration, other arsenals took part. In addition, the rear sights were updated for the new ammunition and were changed to yards from meters, and also did away with the World War I multiple-aperture disk on the rear sight. The top covers also had a stronger feed pawl pivot arm installed, so the gun could handle the stress of pulling an ammunition belt from the ground. Rock Island Arsenal also developed an all-steel water jacket that went into production around 1943; this was stronger than the earlier brass-capped jackets. These steel components were interchangeable with the earlier brass ones to allow for repair of worn or damaged water jacket components.

Other changes were implemented, some during the war, but not all M1917s received these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919-series guns. While the World War I–pattern top cover hinge pin appears to have been retained on most converted M1917s, the later-production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover hinge pin that allowed the top cover to remain open, lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one&#x27;s hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919-series guns.

==== M1918 ====
Air-cooled aircraft version of the M1917. Developed during the First World War, the M1918 arrived too late, but became the dominant weapon of its type in US service until the development of the M1919. It features a heavier barrel, but lighter barrel jacket as compared to the M1917. A sub-variant, the M1918M1, was developed as a flexible version of the fixed M1918.

=== International variants &amp; designations ===
The M1917 pattern has been used in countries the world over in a variety of forms. In certain cases a new designation was applied by the user nation.

==== FN30 ====
From 1930, Belgian Fabrique Nationale produced air-cooled and water-cooled versions of the M1917, chambered in various calibers for domestic and export use.

==== Ksp m/14-29 and ksp m/36 ====
Kulspruta m/14-29 was the Swedish designation for the licensed M1917A1, produced by Carl Gustafs Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna, for infantry support. The main differences was that it was chambered in the standard caliber 6.5×55mm, had spade-grips and used the cooling jacket and tripod of the m/14 (Schwarzlose) tripod, the machine gun the Ksp m/14-29 replaced. The reason for adoption of the Browning was cost: 50 machine guns using the Browning mechanism could be made for the same price as 30 Schwarzlose, which was discovered during the manufacture of Kulspruta m/22.

The 6.5mm bullet was found to be too light for long-range fire support and anti-aircraft use, so in 1932 the heavier 8×63mm patron m/32 cartridge was developed. As this resulted in a heavier recoil, a spring-loaded cradle replaced the backplate with a heavily spring-loaded buffer that acted as an extension of the standard Browning recoil buffer. This also replaced the regular spade-grips with the ones integrated in the cradle. The cradle, now part of the weapon, would then be hooked onto a tripod m/36. This tripod featured, beside a 5×25 power optical sight, advanced elevation and traverse controls. The unprecedented recoil control and steadiness of the tripod made Dolf Goldsmith remark that this arrangement &quot;was undoubtedly the most accurate long-range rifle-caliber machine gun ever made&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swedish Kulspruta m/36&quot;&gt;Swedish Kulspruta m/36, forgottenweapons.com&lt;/ref&gt; For anti-aircraft purposes, a double cradle was made to hold a matching pair of m/36s. The right gun, lacking sights altogether, was fed from the right, while the left gun, with iron sights complemented with an AA sight ring, was fed from left. The cocking handles were located between the guns, while safeties and triggers were individual for left and right. The special AA tripod had elongated legs and chains to either secure the tripod or hang weights on it for extra stability. These double cradles were also used as standard defense, mounted on a ring on the cab roof, on terrain vehicles and armored troop carriers like Terrängbil m/42 KP. The latter was used with good effect in the Congo Crisis in the early-1960s. Until 1966, the m/14-29 and m/36 machine guns could use both the 6.5mm and the 8 mm ammunition. Converting between the two was a matter of changing barrels, cartridge stops, and bolts.

In 1966, most were converted to 7.62×51mm NATO. Some old models were retained in training use to use up the stores of obsolete ammunition. After the stocks were expended in the 1970s, all guns were re-barreled to 7.62mm NATO. The weapons were finally taken out of service in the 1995.

==== Ckm wz.30 ====

The Ckm wz.30 was an unlicensed Polish-built modification of the Colt Model of 1924 chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser. The modifications included new iron sights (V-notch rather than loophole), lengthened butt handle, lengthened barrel, simplified rifle lock for easier exchange of used-up barrels and better handling, mounting adapted for both anti-personnel and AA fire and sights and grips adapted to suit both purposes. Roughly 8,000 were built by Państwowa Fabryka Karabinów.

==== M/29 ====
Norwegian designation for the Colt MG 38 (mentioned in the following section) in , used as the standard heavy machine gun and anti-aircraft weapon for the Norwegian Army from 1929 to 1940. The M/29 replaced the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun in Norwegian service. In all, 1,800 M/29s were in Norwegian service by the time of 9 April 1940 German invasion. The M/29 saw service in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, often deployed as the only heavy weapon of Norwegian front line units.

=== Commercial variants ===
Colt commercially produced the M1917 under several names:
*Colt Model of 1919 (not to be confused with the air-cooled M1919 Browning machine gun)
*Colt Model of 1924.
*Colt Model of 1928. The Model 1928 featured a thumb safety, Type A flash hider, and a mount for a panoramic sight unit.
*Colt MG38 series, derivatives of the Colt M1928 for general commercial sale, designed in 1931.
:The 38 and 38B were water-cooled with a barrel jacket threaded inside the trunnion, unlike the M1917 and Colt Model 1928.
:The 38BT was a short heavy barreled air-cooled weapon resembling the Browning M1919A2, designed for use in tanks.
:The MG40 was an aircraft machine gun, with double handgrips.
:The 38 series also features spade grips, not found on the rest of the M1917 and the majority of the M1919 families.

== Derivatives ==
A simplified, air-cooled version of the weapon, the Model 1919, was adopted after World War I and saw action in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Congo crisis.

<text>The Puerto Rico national football team () represents Puerto Rico in men&#x27;s international football, and are governed by the Federación Puertorriqueña de Fútbol (FPF). The team&#x27;s nickname is &quot;El Huracán Azul&quot; meaning The Blue Hurricane. They are members of the Caribbean Football Union, and part of CONCACAF. The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

== History ==
=== 1940–1990 ===
Puerto Rico&#x27;s first international match was against Cuba in 1940 in which they drew 1–1. They did not record a win until a 3–0 result in 1970 against the Bahamas. In 1972, Puerto Rico recorded a 1–0 win against Panama in a friendly. Wins between the 1980s and 1990s were mainly against the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, and Martinique.

=== Chris Armas years (1993–1994) ===
Chris Armas played for Puerto Rico in the 1993 Caribbean Cup. In the tournament, Puerto Rico established a 4-game win streak without conceding a goal. The competition was not then recognized by FIFA, and so his five matches were considered friendlies. As a result, he was later allowed to switch his allegiance to the United States, for whom he has since been capped over 50 times.

=== 1995–2007 ===
Between 1995 and 2007 Puerto Rico did not record a win, and had only four draws. During this time, the team dropped down in the FIFA Rankings to 202nd.

=== 2008–2015 ===

Over the past few years, Puerto Rico has begun to emerge as a contender, like they were in the 1990s. In 2008, they won two games as visitors against Bermuda (1–0 and 2–0), drew 2–2 with Trinidad and Tobago. They also won for the first time since 1994 when they beat the Dominican Republic in the first round of the World Cup qualifiers. Although they lost the first leg 4–0 to Honduras, they fought a 2–2 tie in the home leg in the second round. The Puerto Rican Football Federation has announced plans that would allow them to participate in the next editions of the Caribbean Cup and Gold Cup. Most capped player Andres Cabrero is the only active player as of 2021 who participated in said 2010 World Cup qualifiers.

Puerto Rico was supposed to make their debut in the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games on home soil in Mayagüez, but due to the controversy of CONCACAF not approving the stadiums, the team couldn&#x27;t compete in the football event. The team was supposed to play in Venezuela instead but due to the lack of teams, the male event was canceled.

Puerto Rico faced World and European champion Spain in a friendly on 15 August 2012, losing 2–1 in the Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

On 5 June 2015, Puerto Rico played a friendly against Bermuda, their last friendly before the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup ending in a 1–1 draw. After losing to Grenada 2–1 in the second round of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Interim coach Jose &#x27;Cukito&#x27; Martinez resigned and a few days later, the Uruguayan Carlos Avedissian solved his visa problems and could finally arrive as the head coach of the national team. On 11 December 2015, Puerto Rico played a friendly against MLS team New York City, losing 2–1.

=== 2016–2020 ===
==== Carlos Avedissian / Jack Stefanowski era ====
Carlos Avedissian took charge of the team in 2015 forming a roster mainly of players from the Puerto Rico local leagues. On 22 May 2016, Puerto Rico played a friendly match against the United States for the first time ever ending in a 3–1 loss. For discrepancies with the Federation, Avedissian was substituted by Jack Stefanowski for the second round on an interim basis. With this team mainly of local players, Puerto Rico advanced for the first time to the third round of the 2017 Caribbean Cup qualification when they defeated Grenada and Antigua and Barbuda in the second round, only two games away from reaching the CONCACAF Gold Cup for the first time. Stefanowski had to leave the technical director position because he was an assistant for Puerto Rico FC.

On 3 September 2016, Puerto Rico faced India for the first time in an international friendly match at the Mumbai Football Arena, but were defeated in the contest 1–4.

==== Carlos García Cantarero era ====
After Stefanowski left the team to continue with Puerto Rico FC, Carlos Cantarero assumed as head coach of the national team with Jose Cukito Martinez (who had coached most of the local players in the Puerto Rico League) as assistant coach. The team played three friendlies, two against the Dominican Republic and one against India, prior to the third round matches against Antigua and Barbuda and Curaçao. Coach Cantarero couldn&#x27;t coach in the friendlies due to visa problems. After the second friendly against the Dominican Republic Assistant Coach Martinez left the team prior to the trip to India and David Guillemat assumed the position. Regardless of the administrative debacle, and coaching changes, Puerto Rico lost the decisive match against Curaçao after being 2–0 up front for which Curaçao as head of group advanced to the Gold Cup.

Puerto Rico didn&#x27;t play an international match until the summer of 2017 when they played to a scoreless draw against Indonesia.

After the devastation of Hurricane Maria in September that left the entire island powerless. On 7 October it was reported MLS club, Orlando City SC announced a &quot;Fuerza Puerto Rico’ Friendly&quot; for 4 November with all the net proceeds from the match going towards the &quot;United for Puerto Rico&quot; initiative to raise funds and aid recovery efforts for the island. Reactivating the national team for a 3rd time this year. The friendly marked Orlando City’s last game of 2017, as well team captain, Kaká with the lions. Puerto Rico lost the exhibition match 6–1.

==== Amado Guevara era ====
In May 2018, the Puerto Rican Football Federation announced that Carlos Cantarero would no longer continue as head coach of the national team, with former Honduran player Amado Guevara taking over as head coach.

=== 2020s ===

On 19 March 2023, just days before the Nations League, the Puerto Rican Football Federation announced Charlie Trout as the new head coach of the national team.

==== 2022–23 Nations League ====
In the second season of the CONCACAF Nations League, Puerto Rico would again be a part of the C-League. This time being inserted to Group D alongside the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. The team would go on to beat the British Islands 3–1 and then later beat the Cayman Islands 5–1. The team would go on to win the group stage, thus earning a Gold Cup prelims invitation and promotion into the B league for the next Nations league. 

In the Gold Cup prelims, the team would draw against Suriname 0–0 and later winning in a penalty shootout 4–3. In the second round of the prelims, Puerto Rico would face Martinique. The team would lose 2–0 and be eliminated from the tournament.

<text>Bonfire is a five-disc box set by Australian rock band AC/DC, released in 1997, and remastered with a release in Digipak format in 2003. It was originally conceived to mark what would have been the 50th birthday of Bon Scott, the band&#x27;s previous lead vocalist who died of alcohol-related misadventure in 1980. The release includes the two disc soundtrack for the film &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, a live recording from the Atlantic Records studio in New York, some previously unreleased early material and a remastered version of the 1980 &quot;Back in Black&quot; album.

==Overview==
The album was originally released in 1997 with the CDs all packaged individually in jewel cases, complete with full artwork. The original issue also features a poster, a backstage pass, keyring and a few other extras depending on the region. When the album was reissued in 2003, it was packaged in a large digipak, similar to a longbox, which featured either four- or five-disc trays. The four-tray versions contained the remastered &quot;Back in Black&quot; in its own case with booklet. All versions of the box feature a large book full of liner notes and rare pictures of the band, mostly from before Scott&#x27;s death.

The boxset was the subject of a bit of derision from AC/DC fans for its limited content and select few rarities. AC/DC defended the release, stating that there was very little recorded by Scott that was not already released.

The Australian version is slightly different; Let There Be Rock: Live in Paris became a single disc album by removing two tracks, Walk All Over You and TNT, which were added to the Volts album instead, creating a four disc boxset.

<doc id="1205668" wikidata="Q1215498" url="?curid=1205668" title="A Single Man (album)">
<text>A Single Man is the twelfth studio album by English musician Elton John. Released in 1978, it is the first album for which Gary Osborne replaced Bernie Taupin as lyricist. It is also the first of two (the second being &quot;Victim of Love&quot;) John albums that, on the original cut, have no tracks co-written by Taupin.

==Production==
&quot;A Single Man&quot; is the first of Elton John&#x27;s albums to not include work by lyricist Bernie Taupin, and the first since his debut &quot;Empty Sky&quot; without producer Gus Dudgeon. The returning members of the Elton John Band are percussionist Ray Cooper and guitarist Davey Johnstone; the latter played on only one song on the album. Paul Buckmaster would not appear on another Elton John album until &quot;Made in England&quot;. Unlike previous compositions in which lyrics came first, John started writing melodies at a piano, and an album unintentionally came about from this. This is also John&#x27;s first album on which he sings in a lower register. &quot;Song for Guy&quot; was written as a tribute to Guy Burchett, a young messenger employed by John&#x27;s record label Rocket Records, who was killed in a motorcycle accident.

The staff and players of Watford Football Club, of which John was chairman at the time, provide backing vocals on &quot;Big Dipper&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot;. Also featured on these tracks are the backing vocals of the female staff from Rocket Records, credited as &#x27;The South Audley Street Girls&#x27; Choir&#x27;.

The photo for the front cover was taken in the Long Walk, which is part of Windsor Great Park in Berkshire. The inside cover shows John in a Jaguar XK140 FHC. John stopped wearing his trademark glasses in public for a period during the late 1970s, and the album photo reflects this.

==Release==
The album was released on 27 October 1978 by MCA in America, and by Rocket in the UK. 
Singles from the album were &quot;Part-Time Love&quot;, October 1978; &quot;Song for Guy&quot;, December 1978; and &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, February 1979. &quot;Song for Guy&quot; was a near-global success, charting high everywhere except the US and Canada, where John&#x27;s label, MCA Records, initially refused to release it, though the single was eventually released there in March 1979.

&quot;A Single Man&quot; was John&#x27;s first album ever to be officially released in the former USSR, though his previous releases had been smuggled into the country in various forms. It was released following the success of his A Single Man in Concert shows in Moscow and Leningrad, though it differed in two ways from its release elsewhere. Firstly, the album was re-titled &quot;Poyot Elton John&quot; [&quot;Elton John sings&quot; in Russian]. Secondly, both &quot;Big Dipper&quot; and &quot;Part-Time Love&quot; were removed, due to the subject matter of the songs. Curiously, John had performed &quot;Part-Time Love&quot; at the USSR shows without objection from Soviet officials.

==Reception==

In the US, &quot;A Single Man&quot; was certified gold in October 1978 and platinum in November of the same year by the RIAA. As with many of John&#x27;s releases of the late 1970s and the 1980s, it received generally mixed reviews from critics.

==Later releases==
The 1998 reissue has five bonus tracks, the first two being the 1978 flop single &quot;Ego&quot; and its B-side &quot;&quot;. The next two tracks are the B-sides of &quot;Part-Time Love&quot; and &quot;Song for Guy&quot; (&quot;I Cry at Night&quot; and &quot;Lovesick&quot; respectively), and the last track, &quot;Strangers&quot;, originally B-side of his 1979 disco-album title track, &quot;Victim of Love&quot;. Some releases of his 1980 album, &quot;21 at 33&quot;, also have &quot;Strangers&quot; as a bonus track.

==Promotion and live performances==
At the time of release, John performed some songs from the album on shows such as &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Big Night&quot; (performing &quot;Part-Time Love&quot;), &quot;Countdown&quot; (miming &quot;Georgia&quot; and &quot;Madness&quot;), &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; (performing &quot;Shooting Star&quot; and &quot;Song for Guy&quot;), &quot;The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot; (performing &quot;Shine on Through&quot;), &quot;Parkinson&quot; (performing &quot;Song for Guy&quot;), &quot;Rockpop&quot; (miming &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Part-Time Love&quot;) and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (miming &quot;Part-Time Love&quot; and performing &quot;Song for Guy&quot;). He performed two solo sets: one for MCA personnel at the Century Plaza Hotel on 14 October 1978 (performing &quot;Shine on Through&quot;, &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; and &quot;Song for Guy&quot;) and the other at a RTL studio on 20 October 1978 (performing &quot;Part-Time Love&quot;, &quot;Shooting Star&quot; and &quot;Song for Guy&quot;). John&#x27;s A Single Man Tour in 1979 included songs from the album (&quot;Part-Time Love&quot; and &quot;Song for Guy&quot;).

Since that period, songs other than &quot;Song for Guy&quot; have not been performed.

<text>The contact process is a method of producing sulfuric acid in the high concentrations needed for industrial processes. Platinum was originally used as the catalyst for this reaction; however, because it is susceptible to reacting with arsenic impurities in the sulfur feedstock, vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) has since been preferred.

This process was patented in 1831 by British vinegar merchant Peregrine Phillips. In addition to being a far more economical process for producing concentrated sulfuric acid than the previous lead chamber process, the contact process also produces sulfur trioxide and oleum.

In 1901 Eugen de Haën patented the basic process involving combining sulfur dioxide and oxygen in the presence of vanadium oxides, producing sulfur trioxide which was easily absorbed into water, producing sulfuric acid. This process was improved remarkably by shrinking the particle size of the catalyst (e.g. ≤ 5000 microns), a process discovered by two chemists of BASF in 1914.

== Process ==

The process can be divided into four stages:

# Combining of sulfur and oxygen (O2) to form sulfur dioxide, then purify the sulfur dioxide in a purification unit
# Adding an excess of oxygen to sulfur dioxide in the presence of the catalyst vanadium pentoxide at 450 °C and 1-2 atm
# The sulfur trioxide formed is added to sulfuric acid which gives rise to oleum (disulfuric acid)
# The oleum is then added to water to form sulfuric acid which is very concentrated. Since this process is an exothermic reaction, the reaction temperature should be as low as possible.

Purification of the air and sulfur dioxide (SO2) is necessary to avoid catalyst &quot;poisoning&quot; (i.e. removing catalytic activities). The gas is then washed with water and dried with sulfuric acid.

To conserve energy, the mixture is heated by exhaust gases from the catalytic converter by heat exchangers.

Sulfur dioxide and dioxygen then react as follows:

:2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g) : Δ&quot;H&quot; = -197 kJ·mol−1

According to the Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, a lower temperature should be used to shift the chemical equilibrium towards the right, hence increasing the percentage yield. However too low of a temperature will lower the formation rate to an uneconomical level. Hence to increase the reaction rate, high temperatures (450 °C), medium pressures (1-2 atm), and vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) are used to ensure an adequate (&gt;95%) conversion. The catalyst only serves to increase the rate of reaction as it does not change the position of the thermodynamic equilibrium. The mechanism for the action of the catalyst comprises two steps:

# Oxidation of SO2 into SO3 by V5+:
#: 2SO2 + 4V5+ + 2O2− → 2SO3 + 4V4+
# Oxidation of V4+ back into V5+ by dioxygen (catalyst regeneration):
#: 4V4+ + O2 → 4V5+ + 2O2−

Hot sulfur trioxide passes through the heat exchanger and is dissolved in concentrated H2SO4 in the absorption tower to form oleum.

: H2SO4 + SO3 → H2S2O7 

Note that directly dissolving SO3 in water is impractical due to the highly exothermic nature of the reaction. Acidic vapor or mists are formed instead of a liquid.

Oleum is reacted with water to form concentrated H2SO4.

:H2S2O7 + H2O → 2 H2SO4

== Purification unit ==
This includes the dusting tower, cooling pipes, scrubbers, drying tower, arsenic purifier and testing box. Sulfur dioxide has many impurities such as vapours, dust particles and arsenous oxide. Therefore, it must be purified to avoid catalyst poisoning (i.e.: destroying catalytic activity and loss of efficiency). In this process, the gas is washed with water, and dried by sulfuric acid. In the dusting tower, the sulfur dioxide is exposed to a steam which removes the dust particles. After the gas is cooled, the sulfur dioxide enters the washing tower where it is sprayed by water to remove any soluble impurities. In the drying tower, sulfuric acid is sprayed on the gas to remove the moisture from it. Finally, the arsenic oxide is removed when the gas is exposed to ferric hydroxide.

== Double contact double absorption ==
The next step to the contact process is &quot;double contact double absorption&quot; (DCDA). In this process the product gases (SO2) and (SO3) are passed through absorption towers twice to achieve further absorption and conversion of SO2 to SO3 and production of higher grade sulfuric acid.

SO2-rich gases enter the catalytic converter, usually a tower with multiple catalyst beds, and are converted to SO3, achieving the first stage of conversion. The exit gases from this stage contain both SO2 and SO3 which are passed through intermediate absorption towers where sulfuric acid is trickled down packed columns and SO3 reacts with water increasing the sulfuric acid concentration. Though SO2 too passes through the tower it is unreactive and comes out of the absorption tower.

This stream of gas containing SO2, after necessary cooling is passed through the catalytic converter bed column again achieving up to 99.8% conversion of SO2 to SO3 and the gases are again passed through the final absorption column thus achieving not only high conversion efficiency for SO2, but also enabling production of a higher concentration of sulfuric acid.

The industrial production of sulfuric acid involves proper control of temperatures and flow rates of the gases as both the conversion efficiency and absorption are dependent on these.

<text>Oracle ZFS is Oracle&#x27;s proprietary implementation of the ZFS file system and logical volume manager for Oracle Solaris. ZFS is a registered trademark belonging to Oracle.

==History==
===Solaris 10===
In update 2 and later, ZFS is part of Sun&#x27;s own Solaris 10 operating system and is thus available on both SPARC and x86-based systems.

===Solaris 11===
After Oracle&#x27;s Solaris 11 Express release, the OS/Net consolidation (the main OS code) was made proprietary and closed-source, and further ZFS upgrades and implementations inside Solaris (such as encryption) are not compatible with other non-proprietary implementations which use previous versions of ZFS.

When creating a new ZFS pool, to retain the ability to use access the pool from other non-proprietary Solaris-based distributions, it is recommended to upgrade to Solaris 11 Express from OpenSolaris (snv_134b), and thereby stay at ZFS version 28.

===Future development===
On September 2, 2017, Simon Phipps reported that Oracle had laid off virtually all of its Solaris core development staff, interpreting it as a sign that Oracle no longer intends to support future development of the platform.

<doc id="1205694" wikidata="Q3049561" url="?curid=1205694" title="Rishyasringa">
<text>Rishyasringa (; ; Pali: Isisiṅga) is a rishi mentioned in Hindu and Buddhist scriptures from the late first millennium BCE. According to the Hindu epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, he was a boy born with the horns of a deer who became a seer and was lured by royal courtesans, which led to the yajna (fire sacrifice) of King Dasharatha. His story also occurs in the Buddhist Jatakas, where he is mentioned as the son of Bodhisatta and was tried to be seduced by royal courtesans.

==Hindu legends==

The story of Rishyasringa briefly appears in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, while a detailed account is narrated in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

===Birth===
According to the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Vibhandaka, a renowned sage and a son of Kashyapa, travels in Mahahrada, when he sees Urvashi, the most beautiful apsara (nymph). Aroused, he emits his seed, which fell into the river. A doe, who is a cursed apsara, swallows it and becomes pregnant due to the sage&#x27;s miraculous powers. After she gives birth to a boy, she is liberated from the curse and returns to heaven. The boy is born with horns and because of which, he is named Rishyasringa. Vibhandaka decides to raise him isolated from society. Rishyasringa grows up in his father&#x27;s ashram in the forest, unaware of existence of any female. He practices &quot;brahmacharya&quot; and acquires magical and miraculous powers due to his chastity.

===Temptation===
Meanwhile, Romapada—the King of Anga—offends a Brahmin, due to which no other Brahmin agrees to perform yajna (fire-sacrifice). This upsets Indra, the king of the gods, and he stops raining on Anga. As a result, the kingdom suffers from drought and famine. Romapada is told that the only way to bring rainfall is by bringing a man with perfect chastity into the kingdom. Romapada learns of Rishyasringa and despite his fear of the power and anger of Vibhandaka, he sends some courtesans to Rishyasringa to bring him into his kingdom.

During Vibhandaka&#x27;s absence, the women come to his ashram and meet Rishyasringa. They tell him that they were hermits. Rishyasringa becomes astonished by seeing their appearance and invites them to perform tapas (penance) with him. Before Vibhandaka arrives, the women leave the place. Rishyasringa becomes love-sick and ignores his daily duties. The next day, the courtesans return and take Rishyasringa to Anga. As a result, the kingdom receives bountiful rains and Rishyasringa marries Shanta. Much of the story is taken up by accounts of the feelings of the young man as he becomes aware of women for the first time.

The story can be found in both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. According to the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Rishyasringa was the chief priest when the King Dasharatha performed a yajna to beget progeny, and Rama, Bharata, and the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born.

==Buddhist legends==
===Naḷinikā Jātaka===

The Naḷinikā Jātaka (Jā 526) introduces a past life of the Buddha, a sage, living alone in the Himālayas. There is semen in the urine he passes, a doe who eats the grass in that place gets pregnant from it. A human boy named Isisiṅga (Pali) is later born to the deer and he grows up in complete seclusion from mankind, and most importantly, from womankind. He even doesn&#x27;t know the difference in the body and appearance of the two.

The boy&#x27;s power becomes so great that it disturbs the god Sakka, the lord of heaven, who causes a drought to occur in the country and blames it on the boy. He then convinces the King to send his daughter to seduce him and to break the austerity of the young seer and to reduce his ascetic power. The King and his daughter accept Sakka&#x27;s reasoning and in good faith – and for the benefit of the country – agree to be part of the plot.

The girl dresses up as an ascetic and while the father is away gathering roots and fruits in the forest, she manages to seduce the boy, who has never seen a woman before. Through their revelling, the boy does indeed lose his powers, after which the girl departs. When his father returns, the infatuated boy informs him of the girl, only to be instructed and rebuked by his father. He then repents for his actions.

===Alambusā Jātaka===
Jātaka 523, the Alambusā Jātaka, also recounts a similar story of Isisinga, in one other previous life of Bodhisatta. Here, Sakka chooses a heavenly nymph to seduce the ascetic. The outcome is the same: the sage is seduced, repents and Sakka is thwarted. In response, he grants a boon to the seductress.

The story also appears in the Mahāvastu (Jones&#x27; translation pp. 139–147), but Ekaśr̥ṅga, as he is known here, is the Bodhisattva, and Nalinī is a past life of Yaśodharā. A major variation in this version of the story is Ekaśr̥ṅga&#x27;s ignorance of his marriage to the girl. He succumbs to worldly responsibilities, eventually becoming king and fathering 32 children before retiring again to the forest and regaining his former powers.

==Veneration==
According to the Tuṅgabhadrāmahātmya which is a division of a Mahapurana, Rishyasringa is regarded to have been born from a place near Sringeri in Karnataka. There is an ancient big temple nearby which is believed to be the place where he lived before moving to Ayodhya. Sringeri is also known as ShringaGiri (Sanskrit: the hills where RishyaShringa resided). The Shiva linga with which the sage merged, can be seen today at the temple in Kigga.

There is a temple of rishyashringa named &#x27;Chehni fort&#x27; situated in Banjar tehsil of Kullu District Himachal Pradesh. In Banjar valley, Rishyasringa is called &quot;Shringa Rishi&quot; by the locals. An idol of Shringa Rishi with the goddess Shanta is present in the temple. This place is about 50  km from Kullu. Rishyasringa is the presiding deity of this secluded valley named Banjar.

==Worship==
In the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh and at Kigga near Sringeri town of Karnataka, there are temples dedicated to Rishyasringa and his wife Shanta.
Many attribute Sihawa, a hill from which Mahanadi originates, as a site of Shringi Rishi&#x27;s Ashrama. its natural location, away from population, further affirms the claims.

<text>&quot;Kaa&#x27;s Hunting&quot; is an 1893 short story by Rudyard Kipling featuring Mowgli. Chronologically the story falls between the first and second halves of &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Brothers&quot;, and is the second story in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894) where it is accompanied by the poem &quot;Road Song of the Bandar-log&quot;.
==Story==
The seven-year-old &quot;man-cub&quot; Mowgli, raised by wolves in the Indian jungle, is being tutored in the Law of the Jungle by Baloo the bear, but &quot;runs off in a temper&quot; when Baloo hits him over the head for inattention. Bagheera the black panther, who disapproves of this corporal punishment, persuades Mowgli to return and recite his lessons. These include the &quot;Master Words&quot; for various species that identify the speaker as a friend. 
Bagheera is impressed with Mowgli&#x27;s progress, but both are horrified when the man-cub then reveals that he has been visiting the Bandar-log (&quot;Monkey-People&quot;) who are shunned by the rest of the jungle.
Mowgli is chastened, but soon afterward is abducted by the Bandar-log through the treetops. Seeing Chil the Kite, Mowgli gives the kites&#x27; Master Word and tells Chil to find Baloo and Bagheera. The bear and the panther, unable to follow the monkeys, recall that the monkeys&#x27; only fear is Kaa the python, and Bagheera goads the python into helping them by repeating (or inventing) some of the Bandar-log&#x27;s insults against him. Here, Chil tells them Mowgli has been taken to the &#x27;Cold Lairs&#x27;, an abandoned human city, and they set off to rescue him. In the Cold Lairs, Mowgli soon realises that the monkeys only captured him as an amusing novelty. They soon become bored of him but refuse to let him go. When Kaa and Bagheera arrive the monkeys throw Mowgli into an abandoned &quot;summer-house&quot; inhabited by cobras, whereupon Mowgli hastily uses the snakes&#x27; Master Word to prevent them from striking. When Baloo and Bagheera arrive, a furious battle ensues. Kaa is delayed by a large section of city walls, but breaks down the wall of the summer house and frees Mowgli, who thanks him courteously. Kaa then scatters, and afterward hypnotises the Bandar-log into submission to himself. Baloo and Bagheera are also hypnotized, but Mowgli frees them. Once away, Bagheera advocates corporal punishment and Baloo opposes it. After &quot;six love-taps&quot; from Bagheera, the score is settled and the three of them go home.

<text>The Stanford Tree is the Stanford Band&#x27;s mascot and the unofficial mascot of Stanford University. Stanford&#x27;s team name is &quot;Cardinal&quot;, referring to the vivid Stanford Cardinal Red color (not the common songbird as at several other schools), and the university does not have an official mascot. The Tree, in various versions, has been called one of America&#x27;s most bizarre and controversial college mascots. The tree regularly appears at the top of Internet &quot;worst mascot&quot; lists but has also appeared on at least one list of top mascots.

==History==
The Tree is a member of the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB) and appears at football games, basketball games, and other events where the band performs. The &quot;Tree&quot; is representative of El Palo Alto, the tree which appears on both the official seal of the University and the municipal seal of Palo Alto, Stanford&#x27;s nearby city.

From 1930 until 1972, Stanford&#x27;s sports teams had been known as the Indians and during the period from 1951 to 1972, Prince Lightfoot (portrayed by Timm Williams, a member of the Yurok tribe) was the official mascot. But in 1972, Native American students and staff members successfully lobbied University President Richard Lyman to abolish the &quot;Indian&quot; name along with what they had come to perceive as an offensive and demeaning mascot. Stanford&#x27;s teams unofficially reverted to using the name &quot;Cardinal&quot;, the color which represented the school before 1930.

From 1972 until 1981, Stanford’s official nickname was the Cardinal, but, during this time, there was debate among students and administrators concerning what the mascot and team name should be. A 1972 student referendum on the issue was in favor of restoring the Indian, while a second 1975 referendum was against. The 1975 vote included new suggestions, many alluding to the industry of the school&#x27;s founder, railroad tycoon Leland Stanford: the Robber Barons, the Sequoias, the Trees, the Cardinals, the Railroaders, the Spikes, and the Huns. The Robber Barons won, but the university&#x27;s administration refused to implement the vote. In 1978, 225 varsity athletes started a petition for the mascot to be the griffin, but that campaign also failed. Finally, in 1981, Donald Kennedy, the president of Stanford, declared that all Stanford athletic teams would be represented exclusively by the color cardinal.

However, in 1975, the band had performed a series of halftime shows which facetiously suggested several other new mascot candidates it considered particularly appropriate for Stanford including the Steaming Manhole, the French Fry, and the Tree. The Tree ended up receiving so much positive attention that the band decided to make it a permanent fixture, and the Tree came to be embraced by the Stanford community at large.

The original Tree costume was conceived and constructed by Christine Hutson. When she left Stanford, she passed along the costume and the role of the Tree to a conga drum player in the band, Robert David Siegel. 

At the 1987 Big Game, Stanford Tree Paul Kelly was attacked by several Cal students who ran onto the field during the halftime show. Barely escaping, Kelly led them to the drum section where all three Berkeley students were tackled.

Due to the heightened visibility of the Stanford Tree, physical altercations with Cal students became commonplace and part of the assignment. At the annual Battle of the Bands at University of California, Davis, Kelly left the Tree costume on the bus after a long day in the sun and Cal students broke into the bus and stole the costume. A week later the band received a ransom note offering the Tree in exchange for Oski the Bear (which had been stolen from the UCB Student Union the previous year). The band did not think much of the trade and a tradition of making a new costume was begun. Every year since then, the band and their many admirers now expect the Tree to be reinvented every fall. With more exposure, the decision about who would become Tree became more rigorous and the band had to adopt a more formal selection process. Today&#x27;s Tree candidate must go through &quot;grueling and humiliating physical and mental challenges&quot; to demonstrate sufficient chutzpah to be the Tree. During &quot;Tree Week,&quot; candidates have been known to perform outrageous, unwise, and often dangerous stunts in order to impress the Tree selection committee, so much so that the university has felt the need to prohibit certain types of audition activities over the years.

The Tree&#x27;s costume, which is created anew each year by the incumbent Tree, is a prominent target for pranksters from rival schools, in particular from Stanford&#x27;s Bay Area nemesis, the University of California, Berkeley (Cal). The tendency for the Tree to come to harm at the hands of Cal fans was showcased in the run-up to the 1998 Big Game. An anonymous coterie of fraternity brothers from Cal known as the Phoenix Five stole the costume and held it &quot;hostage&quot; for two weeks until it was turned in to the UC Berkeley chancellor&#x27;s office and returned to Stanford by the UC Police.

In 1996 two Cal students emerged shirtless from the stands at Memorial Stadium at the Big Game during halftime and tackled the tree, breaking branches and eliciting cheers from the Cal alumni prior to being handcuffed and led away. The most recent theft of the Tree was during the 2012 basketball game against Cal, when a member of the Cal band entered LSJUMB&#x27;s bus and removed the mascot. Older bandsmen quickly sent the Tree outfit back that evening and no charges were pressed.

Violence and absurd levels of prankery have been a two-way street between Cal and Stanford. A few years earlier, during an ESPN-televised timeout during a February 1995 basketball game at Maples Pavilion, the Stanford Tree and Cal&#x27;s mascot Oski got into a fistfight in front of the Stanford student section. The Oski costume&#x27;s headpiece was forcefully removed by the Tree during the scuffle, an act of special significance because Cal has taken great pains to keep the identities of its Oski costume wearers secret since the 1940s.

A spate of troubles brought the Tree even more notoriety in college sports circles. In February 2006, then-Tree Erin Lashnits was suspended until the end of her term as the Tree after her blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.157 (almost twice the legal driving limit in California) during a men&#x27;s basketball game between Stanford and Cal. UC Berkeley police observed her drinking from a flask during the game and cited her for public drunkenness after she failed a breathalyzer test.
In August 2006, the NCAA fined Stanford University for what it termed &quot;multiple violations of tournament policies&quot; after an on-court altercation involving Tree mascot Tommy Leep and tournament officials as the Stanford women&#x27;s basketball team participated in the second round of the NCAA Tournament in Denver. The Tree was then banned from the 2007 Women&#x27;s Tournament.

The Tree was also featured in a few ESPN &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; commercials. One example was when Atlanta Braves right fielder Jason Heyward was talking about how baseball bats were made when the Tree, in the background, fell over. Another example was when golfer Bubba Watson and his caddie were &quot;playing through&quot; the Tree, which was referred to as an obstacle. In 2022, the 44th Stanford Tree, Jordan Zietz was suspended from his role for holding a sign reading &quot;Stanford Hates Fun&quot; with the Arizona State mascot. The &quot;Stanford Hates Fun&quot; sign was part of a student backlash against the perceived curtailing by the university of student activities, which some students started calling a &quot;War on Fun&quot;. The previous Tree, Grayson Armour, said that he would take over as mascot until Zietz returned.

<doc id="1205706" wikidata="Q3246805" url="?curid=1205706" title="Yellow Mama">
<text>Yellow Mama is the electric chair of the United States state of Alabama. It was used for executions from 1927 to 2002.

First installed at Kilby State Prison near Montgomery, Alabama, the chair acquired its yellow color (and from it, the nickname &quot;Yellow Mama&quot;) when it was painted with highway-line paint from the adjacent State Highway Department lab. The chair was built by British inmate Ed Mason in 1927 and was first used to execute Horace DeVaughan in that year. Mason was rewarded for his efforts with a 30-day pass, but he absconded and was later found in a New York state penitentiary.

The last person put to death in Yellow Mama was Lynda Lyon Block, who was executed in 2002. The chair has since been stored in an attic above the execution chamber at the Holman Correctional Facility.

==History==
===Background===
Before 1923, executions in Alabama were the responsibility of the individual counties, which carried them out by hanging in private gallows. In 1923, legislation provided for state-performed executions by electrocution. At Kilby Prison in Montgomery, a special room was designated for this purpose. Inmate Ed Mason, a master carpenter by trade who was serving 60 years for theft and grand larceny, built Yellow Mama. The electric chair remained there until 1970, when it was moved to Holman Prison.

===Operations===
The first execution by electrocution in Alabama was performed in the Yellow Mama on April 8, 1927. Between 1930 and 1976 there were 135 executions completed using Yellow Mama. In 1983, the State Senate Judiciary Committee voted in favor of using lethal injections in place of electrocutions. However, the bill failed. In 1997, a bill was discussed which would allow the condemned prisoners to be executed by the option of lethal injection.

=== Problems ===
Alabama has experienced several problematic executions involving the chair. On April 22, 1983, John Louis Evans, the first post-&quot;Furman&quot; prisoner to be executed by the state, was hit with an initial jolt of electricity, which lasted 30 seconds. Evans&#x27;s body tensed up, causing the electrode on his left leg to snap off. Soon, smoke and flames were shooting out from under the hood that covered his head. When two physicians entered the death chamber they found him still alive. Ignoring Evans&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s plea, a third jolt of electricity was applied, and he died. The execution took a total of 24 minutes and his body was left charred and smoldering. In 1989, the state executed Horace Dunkins, who had an IQ of 69 and was convicted of murdering Lynn McCurry. In Dunkins&#x27;s execution, the first jolt of electricity only knocked him unconscious. Charlie Jones, the warden at the time, said that because the jacks connecting the electricity to the chair had been reversed, there was not enough voltage to kill him on the first try. Therefore, it took 19 minutes for Dunkins to die.

=== Today ===
Yellow Mama is now stored in an attic above the execution chamber at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. The last execution to occur using it was that of Lynda Lyon Block on May 10, 2002. On July 1 of that year, a revision to Alabama&#x27;s death penalty went into effect allowing for an inmate to choose execution by either lethal injection or electrocution. Yellow Mama remains in storage in the event a future death row inmate elects to have the death sentence carried out by electrocution.

State representative Lynn Greer sponsored legislation to return to using the electric chair if lethal injection drugs cannot be obtained. HB18 passed the Alabama House in 2015, but died in the Senate Judiciary committee.

==Notable executions==
*Lynda Lyon Block (1948–2002) - Murderer; the last to be executed using Yellow Mama
*Horace DeVaughn (1893–1927) - Murderer; the first to be executed using Yellow Mama
*John Louis Evans and Wayne Ritter (1950 and 1954 – 1983 and 1987) - Murderers and spree criminals; the former&#x27;s execution was botched
*Henry Francis Hays (1954–1997) - One of several perpetrators of the lynching of Michael Donald
*Rhonda Belle Martin (c.1907–1957) - Serial killer and family annihilator
*Jeremiah Reeves (1935–1958) - Falsely executed for rape

<text>The National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) is the first and largest technological college in the world for students who are deaf or hard of hearing. As one of nine colleges within the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, New York, NTID provides academic programs, access, ASL in-class interpreters and support services—including on-site audiological, speech-language, and cochlear implant support. As of fall quarter 2012, NTID encompasses just under 10% of RIT&#x27;s enrollment, 1259 students. Roughly 775 deaf and hard of hearing students are cross-registered into another RIT college&#x27;s program with support from NTID.

In addition to a master&#x27;s degree in deaf education, NTID also offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in ASL-English Interpretation.

==History==

The institute was established in 1965 by the passage of . The law also established a National Advisory Group to find a suitable site for the school. The Advisory Group considered proposals from Illinois State University, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Southern California, the State University of New York, the University of Colorado at Boulder and others before deciding on RIT as its home in 1966. Three factors helped RIT secure the responsibility for the new institute:
*RIT had just moved to a new campus, so the institute would not find itself in second-hand quarters.
*Rochester businessmen had enlightened views about disability in the workplace and were eager to share those views with the Advisory Group.
*RIT had a trustee, Edmund Lyon, who had served as president of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and as trustee of the Rochester School for the Deaf.

The institute was originally conceived as tuition-free, providing technical training as well as academic and communication skills training to 600 deaf students annually.

NTID admitted its first students in 1968. Its establishment initially caused a great deal of friction on campus between hearing students and deaf students and RIT faculty and NTID faculty, the points of contention centering on the construction of new buildings for NTID, whether or not NTID faculty salaries were more generous than those of their peers, and communication differences between American Sign Language and American English.

In the early 1980s, NTID&#x27;s enrollment spiked as deaf students from the &quot;rubella bulge&quot; of the mid-1960s entered their college years. Enrollment has been trending higher again in recent years; NTID&#x27;s 2008 enrollment was its highest ever at 1,450, easily surpassing the previous record of 1,358 set in 1984.

In 1993, NTID established its Center for Arts and Sciences to help boost the numbers of undecided (or underprepared) students who stay on to pursue a baccalaureate degree. By 2005, this program had raised the proportion of NTID students in bachelor&#x27;s degree programs to 41% (from 12% twenty years earlier).

The history of NTID and the art, culture, technology, and language of the Deaf community are preserved in the RIT/NTID Deaf Studies Archive, which is housed on campus in the RIT Archive Collections in Wallace Library.

<doc id="1205720" wikidata="Q7980353" url="?curid=1205720" title="Weirdo (comics)">
<text>Weirdo was a magazine-sized comics anthology created by Robert Crumb and published by Last Gasp from 1981 to 1993. Featuring cartoonists both new and old, &quot;Weirdo&quot; served as a &quot;low art&quot; counterpoint to its contemporary highbrow &quot;Raw&quot;, co-edited by Art Spiegelman. 

Crumb contributed cover art and comics to every issue of &quot;Weirdo&quot;; his wife, cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, also had work in almost every issue. Crumb focused increasingly on autobiography in his stories in &quot;Weirdo&quot;. Many other autobiographical shorts would appear in &quot;Weirdo&quot; by other artists, including Kominsky-Crumb, Carol Tyler, Phoebe Gloeckner, and Dori Seda. David Collier, a Canadian ex-soldier, published autobiographical and historical comics in &quot;Weirdo&quot;. The anthology introduced artists such as Peter Bagge, Dori Seda, Dennis Worden, and Carol Tyler.

With issue #10, Crumb handed over the editing reins to Bagge; with issue #18, the reins went to Kominsky-Crumb (except for issue #25, which was again edited by Bagge). The three editorial tenures were known respectively as &quot;Personal Confessions&quot;, the &quot;Coming of the Bad Boys&quot;, and &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot;.

Overall, the magazine had a mixed response from audiences; Crumb&#x27;s fumetti contributions, for instance, were so unpopular that they have never appeared in Crumb collections.

== Publication history ==
=== Origins ===
While meditating in 1980, Crumb conceived of a magazine with a lowbrow aesthetic inspired by punk zines, &quot;Mad&quot;, and men&#x27;s magazines of the 1940s and 1950s. 

Contributor Kim Deitch believes that another inspiration for &quot;Weirdo&quot; was Bay Area cartoonist and zine publisher Bruce N. Duncan (often credited as &quot;B. N. Duncan.&quot;) Before &quot;Weirdo&quot; came along, Duncan published a zine called &quot;The Tele Times&quot;, covering &quot;culture and street life in Berkeley.&quot;

In fact, said Deitch, he &quot;first heard about Crumb’s plans to publish a new anthology from Duncan... &#x27;Crumb hadn’t told me about &quot;Weirdo&quot;, but he’d gotten in touch with Bruce and he definitely was one of the first people that he was buttonholing to be in the magazine.&#x27;&quot;

As Deitch discussed at a retrospective panel on &quot;Weirdo&quot;, he believed that: 
=== &quot;Personal Confessions&quot; era ===
Early issues of &quot;Weirdo&quot; reflect Crumb&#x27;s interests at the time – outsider art, fumetti, Church of the SubGenius-type anti-propaganda and assorted &quot;weirdness&quot; (in fact, Crumb provided early publicity for the Church of the SubGenius by reprinting &quot;Sub Genius Pamphlet&quot; #1 in &quot;Weirdo&quot; #1).

Crumb&#x27;s detailed cover borders for most issues of &quot;Weirdo&quot; were an homage to the 1950s humor magazine &quot;Humbug&quot; (edited by Harvey Kurtzman); Crumb claimed that the elaborate Jack Davis–Will Elder cover to the second issue of &quot;Humbug&quot; &quot;changed his life&quot;.

Dori Seda&#x27;s first published comics work was in &quot;Weirdo&quot; #2 (Summer 1981), a strip titled &quot;Bloods in Space&quot;. Her work appeared often in &quot;Weirdo&quot; through issue #24 (Winter 1988/1989), shortly after her untimely death. Dennis Worden&#x27;s first published work appeared in issue #4 (Feb. 1982); he was a frequent contributor to the magazine throughout its run. Peter Bagge sent copies of his self-published comics &quot;Comical Funnies&quot; to Crumb, who published some Bagge strips in &quot;Weirdo&quot; #8 (Summer 1983). Bagge contributed to many issues from that point forward, mostly illustrating &quot;Martini Baton&quot; stories written by Dave Carrino.

In addition to those mentioned above, other cartoonists whose work appeared in early issues of &quot;Weirdo&quot; included Robert&#x27;s brother Maxon Crumb, Robert Armstrong, Ace Backwords, Drew Friedman, Kaz, J. D. King, Spain Rodriguez, Robert Williams, Harry S. Robins (the &quot;Professor Brainard&quot; feature), Jeff John, Terry Boyce, and B. N. Duncan.

The magazine&#x27;s letter column, &quot;Weirdo&#x27;s Advice to the Lovelorn&quot;, was helmed by Terry Zwigoff.

=== &quot;Coming of the Bad Boys&quot; era ===
With issue #10 (Summer 1984), Crumb handed over the editing reins to Peter Bagge (who had become a regular contributor with issue #8); Crumb continued as a regular contributor. New contributors to &quot;Weirdo&quot; during this period included Kim Deitch, Mary Fleener, John Holmstrom, Carel Moiseiwitsch, Diane Noomin, Raymond Pettibon, Savage Pencil, J. R. Williams (his first published comics), S. Clay Wilson, Ken Struck, and Ken Weiner/Ken Avidor.

=== &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; era ===
With issue #18 (Fall 1986), the editorial reins of &quot;Weirdo&quot; went to Kominsky-Crumb; the &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; monicker being a reference to an all-female comics anthology that Kominsky-Crumb co-produced with Diane Noomin in 1976. Bagge returned for a single issue as editor, with &quot;Weirdo&quot; #25, Summer 1989. New contributors to the magazine during this era included Lloyd Dangle, Julie Doucet, Dennis Eichhorn, Justin Green, Krystine Kryttre, Carol Tyler (her first published comics), Penny Van Horn, Michael Dougan, and Mark Zingarelli. Harvey Pekar began a regular column, &quot;Harvey Sez&quot;, in issue #19; his column ran in most of the later issues.

Many stories published in &quot;Weirdo&quot; from the &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; era were later collected in the 1991 anthology &quot;Twisted Sisters: A Collection of Bad Girl Art&quot; — including work by Kominsky-Crumb, Carol Lay, Phoebe Gloeckner, Carel Moiseiwitsch, Van Horn, Kryttre, Doucet, Sternbergh, Seda, and Tyler.

In 1991, after the publication of &quot;Weirdo&quot; #27, Crumb and Kominsky-Crumb moved their family from Northern California to France.

&quot;Weirdo&quot; was at the center of a legal case in 1986: the manager of a comics retailer in the Chicago area, Friendly Frank&#x27;s, was arrested on charges of distributing obscenity. The comic books deemed obscene were &quot;Weirdo&quot;, &quot;Omaha the Cat Dancer&quot;, &quot;The Bodyssey&quot;, and &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot;. The case led to the formation of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.

=== &quot;Weirdo&quot; #28: &quot;Verre D&#x27;eau&quot; ===
&quot;Weirdo&quot;″s final issue, #28, released after a three-year hiatus in 1993, was an internationally themed 68-page giant subtitled &quot;Verre D&#x27;eau&quot; (in French, &quot;glass of water&quot;). Promoted as a &quot;One-Time-Only Special International Issue of Weirdo — Absolutely the Last Issue Ever!&quot;, it was co-edited by Aline Kominsky-Crumb and French editor Jean-Pierre Mercier. In addition to the usual roster of contributors, issue #28 featured work from French and European cartoonists such as Edmond Baudoin, Florence Cestac, Jean-Christophe Menu, Placid , Willem, and Aleksandar Zograf.

R. Crumb&#x27;s contributions to the issue — two tongue-in-cheek stories called &quot;When the Niggers Take Over America!&quot; and &quot;When the Goddamn Jews Take Over America!&quot; — got the issue banned as hate literature in Canada.

In 2013, Last Gasp released R. Crumb&#x27;s &quot;The Weirdo Years: 1981-&#x27;93&quot;, a 255-page collection of all of Crumb&#x27;s contributions to the anthology.

In 2019, Last Gasp published &quot;The Book of Weirdo: A Retrospective of R. Crumb&#x27;s Legendary Humor Comics Anthology&quot;, by Jon B. Cooke. The 288-page hardcover book &quot;features the comprehensive story of the fondly-recalled magazine, along with testimonials from over 130 of the mag&#x27;s contributors, plus interviews with &quot;Weirdo&quot;&#x27;s three editors ... as well as publisher &#x27;Baba Ron&#x27; Turner. New York&#x27;s Society of Illustrators hosted an event commemorating the book&#x27;s publication, with a panel of guests, including Art Spiegelman, Kim Deitch, John Holmstrom, Glenn Head, Mark Newgarden, Drew Friedman, and Cooke.

In 2022, Boston College&#x27;s McMullen Museum of Art featured the exhibition &quot;American Alternative Comics, 1980–2000: Raw, Weirdo, and Beyond&quot;, that showcased the work of a number of &quot;Weirdo&quot; contributors, including Bagge, Lynda Barry, Crumb, Doucet, Gilbert Hernandez, Kominsky-Crumb, Panter, and Woodring.

<text>Western Montana is the western region of the U.S. state of Montana. The most restrictive definition limits western Montana only to the parts of the state west of the Continental Divide. Other common definitions add in the mountainous areas east of the divide including Beaverhead, Gallatin, Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, Madison, and Park Counties. The region is sometimes considered to be part of the Inland Northwest.

==Geography, biomes and climate==
Western Montana is dominated by the Rocky Mountains. Most of Western Montana is covered in forest, prominent species being Ponderosa pine, aspen, and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir.

Common fauna include the black bear, moose, elk, and coyote. The grizzly bear lives in Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and surrounding areas.

Precipitation is lower in the valleys, which are mostly semiarid and receive 8 to 25 inches of precipitation, largely in snow, and higher in the mountains, some areas of which qualify as temperate rainforest, especially in the northwest around Glacier National Park and Libby. Winters are cold, sometimes bitterly cold, and summers are warm.

==History==

Western Montana was inhabited by the Salish, Kootenai, Shoshone, Flathead, and Kalispel people. In the late 19th century non-indigenous people arrived and established mines and additional cities in the mountains and valleys.

Gold was discovered in Last Chance Gulch in the 1860s and soon the city of Helena was born. Today Helena is the State capital of Montana. Helena still has much of the charm of a 19th-century mining town. Many of the old buildings have been renovated, and hundreds of 19th-century Victorian homes and mansions fill Helena&#x27;s old neighborhoods. Helena is one of the best-preserved mining towns on the Western frontier. Copper was discovered In Butte and the surrounding areas in the 1870s. Vast quantities of copper were mined, leaving behind the largest Superfund cleanup site in the history of the nation. Copper is still mined at the continental pit in Butte. Missoula is the largest city in Western Montana and the second-largest in the state after Billings.

Western Montana, though faring better than much of the nation, was the portion of the state hit hardest by the current economic downturn. The closing of Smurfit-Stone Container in 2009 alone caused the loss of over 2000 jobs through 2012. Much of western Montana has felt the effects of a housing bust as well.

<text>Michael Bennett (April 8, 1943 – July 2, 1987) was an American musical theatre director, writer, choreographer, and dancer. He won seven Tony Awards for his choreography and direction of Broadway shows and was nominated for an additional eleven.

Bennett choreographed &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, &quot;Follies&quot; and &quot;Company&quot;. In 1976, he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical and the Tony Award for Best Choreography for the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. Bennett, under the aegis of producer Joseph Papp, created &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; based on a workshop process which he pioneered. He also directed and co-choreographed &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; with Michael Peters.

==Early life and career==
Bennett was born Michael DiFiglia in Buffalo, New York, the son of Helen (née Ternoff), a secretary, and Salvatore Joseph DiFiglia, a factory worker. His father was Italian American and his mother was Jewish. He studied dance and choreography in his teens and staged a number of shows in his local high school - Bennett High School in Buffalo, NY - before dropping out to accept the role of Baby John in the US and European tours of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. He gave himself a new last name when he pursued this life in the arts, taking inspiration from his high school.

Bennett&#x27;s career as a Broadway dancer began in the 1961 Betty Comden–Adolph Green–Jule Styne musical &quot;Subways Are for Sleeping&quot;, after which he appeared in Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s Love&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Bajour&quot;. In the mid-1960s he was a featured dancer on the NBC pop music series &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, where he met fellow dancer Donna McKechnie.

Bennett made his choreographic debut with &quot;A Joyful Noise&quot; (1966), which lasted only twelve performances, and in 1967 followed it with another failure, &quot;Henry, Sweet Henry&quot; (based on the Peter Sellers film &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot;). Success finally arrived in 1968, when he choreographed the hit musical &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; on Broadway. With a contemporary pop score by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, a wisecracking book by Neil Simon and Bennett&#x27;s well-received production numbers, including &quot;Turkey Lurkey Time&quot;, the show ran for 1,281 performances. Over the next few years, he earned praise for his work on the straight play &quot;Twigs&quot; with Sada Thompson and the musical &quot;Coco&quot; with Katharine Hepburn. These were followed by two Stephen Sondheim productions, &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;Follies,&quot; co-directed with Hal Prince.

In 1973, Bennett was asked by producers Joseph Kipness and Larry Kasha to take over the ailing Cy Coleman–Dorothy Fields musical &quot;Seesaw&quot;. In replacing the director Ed Sherin and choreographer Grover Dale, he asked for absolute control over the production as director and choreographer and received credit as &quot;having written, directed, and choreographed&quot; the show.

==&quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and the 1980s==
Bennett&#x27;s next project was &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. The musical was formed out of twenty hours of taped sessions with Broadway dancers. Bennett was invited to the sessions originally as an observer but soon took charge. He co-choreographed and directed the production, which debuted in July 1975 off-Broadway. It won nine Tony Awards and the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He later claimed that the worldwide success of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; became a hindrance, as the many international companies of the musical demanded his full-time attention. Bennett would later become a creative consultant for the 1985 film version of the musical but left due to creative differences. He always sought creative control over his projects, but Hollywood producers were unwilling to give him the influence he demanded.

There are some filmed records which testify to the show&#x27;s initial power. Television talk-show host Phil Donahue devoted an entire program to the original cast, during which they reminisce and recreate some of the musical numbers. The 2008 feature-length documentary &quot;Every Little Step&quot; chronicles the casting process of the musical&#x27;s 2006 revival, with re-created choreography by Bennett&#x27;s long-time associate Baayork Lee, and, in the course of the film, the saga of the original production is re-told as well, through the use of old film clips and revealing interviews from the original collaborators, including Lee, Bob Avian (who was the show&#x27;s original co-choreographer with Bennett and the director of the revival), composer Marvin Hamlisch and the original&#x27;s leading lady, Donna McKechnie.

Bennett&#x27;s next musical was a project about late-life romance called &quot;Ballroom&quot;. Although financially unsuccessful, it garnered seven Tony Award nominations, and Bennett won one for Best Choreography. He admitted that any project that followed &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; was bound to be an anti-climax. Bennett had another hit in 1981 with &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, a backstage epic about a girl group like The Supremes and the expropriation of black music by a white recording industry. In the early 1980s, Bennett worked on various projects, one of which was titled &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, based on a legendary story &quot;Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, but none of them reached the stage.

In 1978, he purchased 890 Broadway and converted it for use as a rehearsal studios complex for dance and theatre. In 1986, he was forced to sell it for $15 million due to stress-induced angina and the financial losses of the property. Two tenants purchased the building, and it remains a rehearsal facility for American Ballet Theatre, Eliot Feld&#x27;s Ballet Tech, Gibney Dance Company, and others.

He always collaborated with his assistant Bob Avian, who was a lifelong friend.

In 1985, Bennett abandoned the nearly-completed musical &quot;Scandal&quot;, by writer Treva Silverman and songwriter Jimmy Webb, which had been developing for nearly five years through a series of workshop productions. The show was sexually daring, but the conservative climate and the growing AIDS panic made it unlikely commercial material. He was then signed to direct the West End production of &quot;Chess&quot; but had to withdraw in January 1986 due to his failing health, leaving Trevor Nunn to complete the production using Bennett&#x27;s already commissioned sets.

== Analysis ==
Unlike his more famous contemporary Bob Fosse, Bennett was not known for a particular choreographic style. Instead, Bennett&#x27;s choreography was motivated by the form of the musical involved, or the distinct characters interpreted.

In act 2 of &quot;Company&quot;, Bennett defied the usual choreographic expectations by deliberately taking the polish off the standard Broadway production number. The company stumbled through the steps of a hat and cane routine (&quot;Side By Side&quot;) and thus revealed to the audience the physical limitations of the characters&#x27; singing and dancing. Bennett made the audience aware that this group had been flung together to perform, and that they were in over their heads. He intended the number to be not about the routine, but rather the characters behind it.

The song &quot;One&quot; from &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; functions in a different way. The various phases of construction/rehearsal of the number are shown, and because the show is about professional dancers, the last performance of the song-and-dance routine has all the gloss and polish expected of Broadway production values. Bennett&#x27;s choreography also reveals the cost of the number to the people behind it.

Bennett was influenced by the work of Jerome Robbins. &quot;What Michael Bennett perceived early in Robbins&#x27; work was totality, all the sums of a given piece adding to a unified whole&quot;. In &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, Bennett&#x27;s musical staging was described as a &quot;mesmerizing sense of movement&quot;:

The most thrilling breakthrough of the extraordinary show is that whereas in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; Michael Bennett choreographed the cast, in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; he has choreographed the set. Bennett&#x27;s use of [the plexiglass towers that dominated the set] was revolutionary. The towers moved to create constantly changing perspectives and space, like an automated ballet. They energized the action, driving it forcefully along. It&#x27;s why there were no set-piece dance routines in the show: dance and movement were organic to the entire action. But Bennett had made the mechanical set his dancers.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bennett was bisexual. In his younger days, Bennett had a relationship with Larry Fuller, a dancer, choreographer and director. He had a long professional and personal relationship with the virtuoso dancer Donna McKechnie, who danced his work in both &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; and &quot;Company&quot; and won the 1976 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in the role he had created for her in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. They married on December 4, 1976, but after only a few months they separated and eventually divorced in 1979. In the late 1970s, Sabine Cassel, the then-wife of French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel left her family in Paris to live with Bennett in Manhattan, but the relationship soured. During his adult life, Bennett &quot;took elaborate pains to ensure that the public never suspected he was gay. When he was diagnosed with AIDS in December 1985, (he) carefully disguised that fact as well&quot;.

Bennett&#x27;s addictions to alcohol and drugs, notably cocaine and quaaludes, severely affected his ability to work and affected many of his professional and personal relationships. His paranoia grew as his dependency did. Worried by his celebrity and his father&#x27;s Italian background, he began to suspect he might fall victim to a Mafia hit.

Bennett&#x27;s last lover was Gene Pruit. In 1986 both Pruit and friend Bob Herr lived with Bennett for the last eight months of his life in Tucson, Arizona, where he received care at the University of Arizona Medical Center. Bennett died from AIDS-related lymphoma at the age of 44. He left a portion of his estate to fund research to fight the pandemic. Bennett&#x27;s memorial service took place at the Shubert Theatre in New York City (the home at that time of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;) on September 29, 1987.

<text>Amar Akbar Anthony is a 1977 Indian Hindi-language masala film directed and produced by Manmohan Desai and written by Kader Khan. Released in India on 27 May 1977, the film stars an ensemble cast of Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan, Neetu Singh, Parveen Babi, Shabana Azmi, Nirupa Roy, Pran and Jeevan. The plot focuses on three brothers separated in childhood who are adopted by families of different faiths; Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. They grow up to be a police officer, a qawwali singer and the owner of a country bar, respectively. The soundtrack album was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal and the lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi. The film earned at the Indian box office, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of that year, alongside &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; and &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot;.

Religious tolerance became a landmark theme in Bollywood masala films, building on the masala formula pioneered a few years earlier by Nasir Hussain&#x27;s &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973). &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; also had a lasting impact on pop culture with its catchy songs, quotable one-liners, and the character of Anthony Gonsalves (played by Bachchan). It won several awards at the 25th Filmfare Awards, including Best Actor, Best Music Director and Best Editing. It was later remade in Tamil as &quot;Shankar Salim Simon&quot; (1978), in Telugu as &quot;Ram Robert Rahim&quot; (1980), and in Malayalam as &quot;John Jaffer Janardhanan&quot; (1982). In Pakistan, the film was unofficially remade in Punjabi as &quot;Akbar Amar Anthony&quot; (1978).

== Plot ==
Kishanlal, a chauffeur, is released from prison on 15 August, 1955, after serving a sentence for the fatal hit-and-run accident committed by his employer, crime lord Robert. Despite Robert&#x27;s promises, Kishanlal returns home to find his wife Bharati suffering from TB and their three sons starving. Enraged, Kishanlal confronts Robert to beg for his assistance, only to be humiliated, abused and disowned. Turning the tables on Robert&#x27;s henchmen, Kishanlal escapes in a car loaded with smuggled gold bullion, pursued by Robert&#x27;s goons.

Arriving home, Kishanlal finds Bharati gone; her suicide note explains her shame and despair. Taking his sons with him, he eludes pursuit to place the boys at the foot of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s statue in Borivali National Park, leaving the eldest in charge. He drives off to mislead Robert&#x27;s goons, but after a fiery car crash both the police and Robert&#x27;s people believe Kishanlal and his sons are dead.

The three children become separated. Amar, the eldest, runs after his father, is knocked down by Robert&#x27;s goons and adopted by Hindu Police Superintendent Khanna. Middle son Anthony goes in search of food for his crying baby brother; left alone, Raju is found and adopted by kindly Muslim tailor Darji Ilahabadi. Returning to find no one, Anthony shelters from a storm outside a nearby Catholic church, falling asleep from exhaustion. The parish priest, Father Gonsalves, discovers him and Bharati&#x27;s suicide note and adopts him. Each will be reared in the religions of their adoptive fathers: Hindu, Islam and Christianity.

Elsewhere: Bharati is caught in the storm and struck blind by a falling branch - divine punishment for leaving her sons. She is rescued and dropped off home by Mr. Ilahabadi, but cannot see Raju beside him; at home she is told her family is dead. Kishanlal escapes the car crash and finds Robert&#x27;s gold; returning to the empty park a rich man – he is devastated to be alone.

Twenty-two years pass. Bharati, now a flower seller, is the victim of a hit-and-run accident outside a church and is rushed to a private hospital by Anthony, the moonshining Robin Hood of the neighborhood. Raju, now called Akbar and a popular &quot;Qawwali&quot; singer, is at the hospital to romance Dr. Salma Ali because her grumpy father Taiyyab Ali disapproves of him. Amar is the police inspector who arrives to check on the accident case. All three men dontate blood to save Bharati&#x27;s life, unaware they are related. Later, Amar tracks down highway robbers and meets Lakshmi, forced by her abusive criminal stepmother and stepbrother Ranjeet to act as bait to protect her elderly, wheelchair-bound grandmother. Together they take evidence and arrest the stepmother, and Amar gives sanctuary to Lakshmi and her grandmother in his home.

With Robert&#x27;s gold Kishanlal became a wealthy crime lord in his own right. Kidnapping Robert&#x27;s infant daughter Jenny in revenge for his lost family, he reared her as his &#x27;niece&#x27; and sent her to school abroad. He also destroyed Robert&#x27;s organization, forcing a grovelling Robert to work for him while begging for his daughter&#x27;s return. In the middle of a smuggling operation Kishanlal&#x27;s gang are raided by police: in the chaos Robert takes a crate of Kishanlal&#x27;s smuggled gold and shoots Superintendent Khanna (Amar&#x27;s &#x27;father&#x27;), badly wounding him. With the gold Robert reinstates himself as a crime lord and plans to get Jenny back and kill Kishanlal, hiring Ranjeet in the process.

Jenny returns from abroad and Anthony falls head over heels in love with her during Easter Sunday services. Bharati, taken hostage by Robert, suffers a minor head injury while escaping; miraculously, her sight is restored at a festival hosted by Akbar in honor of Sai Baba of Shirdi. Further, she identifies Akbar as Raju from a childhood photograph with Mr. Ilahabadi, while he recognizes her as the blind woman he drove home that fateful night.

Akbar rescues Salma and Taiyyab Ali from a house fire set by Taiyyab&#x27;s blackmailing former mistress. A grateful Taiyyab gives permission for Akbar and Salma&#x27;s marriage, leading to Akbar and Amar discovering they are brothers, Kishanlal and Bharati their parents.

Events take a drastic turn when Kishanlal is double-crossed by Jenny&#x27;s bodyguard Zebisco, who takes her to Robert in exchange for her hand in marriage. Father Gonsalves and Lakshmi see her abducted, but Lakshmi is also taken by Ranjeet and Robert murders Father Gonsalves – planting Kishanlal&#x27;s Kali talisman as a &#x27;clue.&#x27; Through Father Gonsalves&#x27; death Anthony discovers that Kishanlal and Bharati are his parents and Amar and Akbar his brothers.

The brothers take action to infiltrate Robert&#x27;s mansion. Akbar, made suspicious when strangers try to collect Jenny&#x27;s wedding dress, disguises himself as an elderly dithering tailor who goes with them to make last minute alterations. He sends a letter to his adopted father which Salma reads, and she joins him as his &#x27;assistant/wife&#x27; to help the girls escape. Amar and Anthony waylay and impersonate the one-man band and Catholic priest on their way to Robert&#x27;s to marry Jenny and Zebisco. Rejoicing in their reunion, the brothers celebrate as they go after Robert, Zebisco, Ranjeet and the remaining goons.

Happy that he is alive, Bharati is distraught to learn Kishanlal will go to prison for his crimes, but he reassures her: their reunited family is the only thing that matters to him. Superintendent Khanna, recovered from Robert&#x27;s attack, briefly releases Kishanlal so that he may embrace his sons. The film ends with the brothers and their sweethearts joyfully driving into the sunset.

==Production==
&quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; has a cinematic antecedent in Yash Chopra&#x27;s 1965 film &quot;Waqt&quot;, in which a father&#x27;s three sons are separated from each other. &quot;Waqt&quot; also inspired the 1976 super-hit diamond jubilee Pakistani film &quot;Talash&quot;, starring Shabnam and Nadeem. However, &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; was slated to release in 1975, prior to &quot;Talash&quot;&#x27;s release.

Prayag Raj wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay, while Kader Khan wrote the dialogue.

The character of Anthony Gonsalves was named after the famous composer and teacher of the same name, whose pupils included Pyarelal (of Laxmikant–Pyarelal, the composer duo of the film) and R. D. Burman. Director Manmohan Desai had planned for Amitabh&#x27;s character to be named “Anthony Fernandes,” with Bakshi&#x27;s song entitled “My Name is Anthony Fernandes.” However, the song didn&#x27;t go well with Laxmikant-Pyarelal. Composer Pyarelal then recalled his famous violin teacher and suggested that the character&#x27;s last name be changed to “Gonsalves.” The nonsensical monologue preceding the &quot;My Name Is Anthony Gonsalves&quot; sequence was taken in part from an 1878 speech by British politician Benjamin Disraeli in reference to W. E. Gladstone.

===Filming===
&quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; was Manmohan Desai&#x27;s first film as an independent film producer. The film was shot over a month at Ranjit Studios in Mumbai. Some exterior and interior shots were filmed at the Mount Mary Church in Bandra, Mumbai and at the Don Bosco School, Wadala, Mumbai respectively. Shooting was scheduled so that the entire cast didn&#x27;t have to appear together except for the climactic sequence and the title song (&quot;Anhoni Ko Honi&quot;), where they all perform as a group. However, the shooting went over schedule, which required Rishi Kapoor and Shabana Azmi to shoot their scenes separately so they could leave towards the end of production to work on other films.

==Analysis==
&quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; incorporates a strong element of secularism within a Bollywood masala film. Analysts such as Virdi (2003) and Kavoori &amp; Punathambekar (2008) note that the themes of Desai&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; include religious pluralism and secular nationalism. Philip Lutgendorf hints that the separation of the three children on Indian Independence Day is akin to the Partition of India. Similarly, Vijay Mishra (2013) argues that the film reaffirmed India&#x27;s &quot;liberal ethos.&quot;
 The three religions represented by the titular characters are the &quot;pillars of the nation:&quot; when they work together, they can restore life to their mother (represented when they donate blood during the opening title sequence) and beat any evil (symbolised by their common villain). The characters&#x27; reunion with their parents completes the nationalistic allegory, suggesting that what was lost at independence can be regained.

The film&#x27;s masala style is evident in its plot and characters. According to Varia (2013), &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; was conceived as a tragedy but later incorporated many other genres. Dickson (2016) commented that the film featured a plot that was so complex that it would &quot;give even Shakespeare migraines.&quot; Some authors also highlight the archetypal character of the suffering and self-sacrificing mother (Roy). However, Dinesh Raheja concludes that &quot;ultimately, the show belongs to Amitabh Bachchan. In a tailor-made role, he has the audience in stitches. Despite his playing an implausible character, one quickly surrenders one&#x27;s reservations in favour of a rollicking romp.&quot;

==Music==
&quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;″s soundtrack was composed by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, with lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi. It proved as popular and successful as the film itself. The vinyl record, released on Polydor, was the first LP that was coloured pink.

Some of the biggest names in the Indian music industry of the time provided vocals for the songs:
* Mukesh and Mahendra Kapoor for Khanna
* Mohammed Rafi and Shailendra Singh for Rishi Kapoor
* Kishore Kumar for Bachchan
* Lata Mangeshkar for Azmi, Neetu Kapoor and Babi

The song &quot;Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyar&quot; is notable for bringing Mukesh, Rafi, Kumar and Mangeshkar together for the first and only occasion in their careers. The film also features a comical &quot;filmi qawwali&quot; entitled &quot;Parda Hai Parda&quot; sung by Rafi, with a single line (for Bachchan) supplied by an uncredited Amit Kumar (Kishore Kumar&#x27;s son).

==Release==
The Emergency Period delayed the release of several of Manmohan Desai&#x27;s films. As a result, four of Desai&#x27;s films, &quot;Dharam Veer&quot;, &quot;Chacha Bhatija&quot;, &quot;Parvarish,&quot; and &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, were released in 1977. Incidentally, all of these would be amongst the top-grossing films of the year.

===Marketing===
For the film&#x27;s marketing, erasers with the images of Vinod Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, and Amitabh Bachchan were sold to students. Posters, postcards, and song booklets of the film were sold in shops. Colourful vests and metal crosses that were similar to the ones worn by Bachchan in the film achieved popularity.

==Reception==
The film grossed at the Indian box office and was the highest-grossing Bollywood film at the Indian Box Office for the year 1977. It has since been regarded as one of the most iconic films of Indian cinema.

Adjusted for inflation, the film has grossed approximately 423 crores ($51 million) as of 2023.

==Accolades==
In 2023, Time Out ranked it #10 on its list of the &quot;100 Best Bollywood Movies.&quot;

<text>In 1617 a treatise in Latin titled Rabdologiæ and written by John Napier was published in Edinburgh. Printed three years after his treatise on the discovery of logarithms and in the same year as his death, it describes three devices to aid arithmetic calculations.

The devices themselves don&#x27;t use logarithms, rather they are tools to reduce multiplication and division of natural numbers to simple addition and subtraction operations.

The first device, which by then was already popularly used and known as Napier&#x27;s bones, was a set of rods inscribed with the multiplication table. Napier coined the word rabdology (from Greek ῥάβδος [rhabdos], rod and λόγoς [logos] calculation or reckoning) to describe this technique. The rods were used to multiply, divide and even find the square roots and cube roots of numbers.

The second device was a [[promptuary]] (Latin &quot;promptuarium&quot; meaning storehouse) and consisted of a large set of strips that could multiply multidigit numbers more easily than the bones. In combination with a table of reciprocals, it could also divide numbers.

The third device used a checkerboard like grid and counters moving on the board to perform binary arithmetic. Napier termed this technique [[location arithmetic]] from the way in which the locations of the counters on the board represented and computed numbers. Once a number is converted into a binary form, simple movements of counters on the grid could multiply, divide and even find square roots of numbers.

Of these devices, Napier&#x27;s bones were the most popular and widely known. In fact, part of his motivation to publish the treatise was to establish credit for his invention of the technique. The bones were easy to manufacture and simple to use, and several variations on them were published and used for many years.

The promptuary was never widely used, perhaps because it was more complex to manufacture, and it took nearly as much time to lay out the strips to find the product of numbers as to find the answer with pen and paper.

Location arithmetic was an elegant insight into the simplicity of binary arithmetic, but remained a curiosity probably because it was never clear that the effort to convert numbers in and out of binary form was worth the trouble.

An interesting tidbit is this treatise contains the earliest written reference to the decimal point (though its usage would not come into general use for another century).

The computing devices in &quot;Rabdology&quot; were overshadowed by Napier&#x27;s seminal work on logarithms as they proved more useful and more widely applicable. Nevertheless, these devices (as indeed are logarithms) are examples of Napier&#x27;s ingenious attempts to discover easier ways to multiply, divide and find roots of numbers. Location arithmetic in particular foreshadowed the ease of and power of mechanizing binary arithmetic, but was never fully appreciated.

<text>Ørsted A/S (formerly DONG Energy) is a Danish multinational energy company. Headquartered in Fredericia, Denmark, Ørsted is the largest energy company in Denmark. The company adopted its current name on 6 November 2017. It was previously known as DONG.

As of January 2022, the company is the world&#x27;s largest developer of offshore wind power by number of built offshore wind farms. Ørsted developed approximately 30% of the global offshore wind power installed capacity, excluding mainland China. 
Globally, Ørsted produces 90% of its energy from renewable sources, and has an objective of exceeding 95% by 2023 and 99% by 2025. 
The company has a goal of net zero generation by 2025 and no carbon emissions by 2040.

==History==

===Origin===
Ørsted has its origin in the Danish state-owned company Dansk Naturgas A/S. The company was founded in 1972 to manage gas and oil resources in the Danish sector of the North Sea. After some years, the company was renamed to Dansk Olie og Naturgas A/S (DONG), meaning Danish Oil and Natural Gas. At the beginning of the decade of the 2000s, DONG started to expand itself into the electricity market by taking long positions in electricity companies. In 2005, DONG acquired and merged Danish electrical power producers Elsam and Energi E2 and public utility (electricity distribution) companies NESA, Københavns Energi and Frederiksberg Forsyning. The result of the merger was the creation of DONG Energy. The merger was approved by the European Commission on 14 March 2006. In 2002 Elsam had installed the 160 MW Horns Rev offshore wind farm, which was the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the world.

In 2005, DONG Energy acquired 10.34% in the Ormen Lange gas field (operated by Shell). The share of gas reserves allocated to DONG Energy are approximately .
The following year, DONG entered a 20-year contract for one billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from 2011, from Gazprom in Russia through Nord Stream 1 and Germany. The deal included that DONG delivers 600 million cubic meters per year (for 15 years) from the Ormen Lange gas field to Gazprom in United Kingdom.

In 2007, DONG and Wingas (partly owned by Gazprom) agreed to a gas swap, where DONG delivers gas to Wingas UK, while Wingas delivers the same amount to DONG in North Germany. The deal was criticized as &quot;damaging to European interests&quot;.

===Use of fossil fuels===
At about the time of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, DONG Energy adopted the &quot;85/15 vision&quot; strategy, with the aim of changing from a company with 85% of activities fossil fuel based to a company 85% based on green energy activities.

In 2009, the Gazprom-&gt;DONG contract was doubled to 2 bcm/year for 18 years, beginning in 2012. 
However, Gazprom records showed that DONG only bought 15% of that amount in 2012 and 2013.

In 2009, DONG Energy sold its fiber broadband in northern Zealand to TDC A/S.

In 2010, the company started a cooperation with Dutch .
However, in 2014 DONG Energy withdrew its consumer activities from the Dutch market.
In 2010, DONG divested Norwegian power companies Salten and Nordkraft. 

In September 2013, DONG Energy sold a power cable accessing the London Array wind farm to its partners, E.ON and Masdar for around $728 million.

===Focus on offshore wind power===
By 2012, DONG Energy had a wind turbine capacity of 794 MW and planned to add another 594 MW the following year.
In 2013, the company finished the construction of the 400 MW Anholt Offshore Wind Farm off the Danish island of Anholt in the Kattegat at a cost of 10 billion Danish kroner (€1.35 bln). DONG Energy was the only bidder in the process.
The following year, DONG Energy divested its last onshore wind turbines, focusing on offshore wind power. of which DONG Energy had 3,000 MW in 2015;

As part of the restructuring plan to fund offshore wind projects, in January 2014 the company sold an 18% stake to New Energy Investment S.a.r.l., a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, while Danish pension funds, ATP and PFA Pension acquired 4.9% and 1.8% accordingly. The deal was heavily criticised and caused a split of the ruling coalition of Helle Thorning-Schmidt.
Six cabinet ministers and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party withdrew from the government.
On 9 June 2016, some of these shares were sold in an IPO at Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
In 2015, DONG Energy had a deficit of 12 billion DKK, the largest of any Danish company ever.

DONG Energy was listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in June 2016. At the same time, it divested its ownership shares of five Norwegian oil and gas fields to Faroe Petroleum.
That year, the company was voted number 11 on the Clean200 list.

In 2017, DONG Energy completed decommissioning of the world&#x27;s first offshore wind farm, Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm.

===Name change===
In 2017, the company decided to phase-out the use of coal for power generation, and it sold off its oil and gas business to Ineos for US$1.05 billion.
After selling its oil and gas business the company announced its transition to renewable energy was fulfilled and changed its name to Ørsted after the Danish scientist Hans Christian Ørsted, citing that DONG was inappropriate considering they no longer owned any oil and natural gas assets.

In 2018 Ørsted acquired Deepwater Wind to expand offshore wind in the US.

In 2018, a gas price arbitration case was closed between Gazprom on one side, and Ørsted, Shell and others on the opposite side.

In 2019, Ørsted divested an electricity distribution network for $3 billion.

On 9 September 2020 it was revealed that Mads Nipper, former CEO of Grundfos, will take over as CEO from Henrik Poulsen on 1 January 2021.

In 2020 developer Ørsted sold a 50% stake in the Greater Changhua 1 Offshore Wind Farm in Taiwan to Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec and Cathay PE for $2.7 billion.

In 2022, Ørsted began rewilding the seabottom near some of its offshore wind farms.

==Operations==
Ørsted considers Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands as core markets of corporation. However, in 2015 they also received a lease from the US agencies the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which, in the lease, handed over some sea area in the United States for wind park development, specifically in New Jersey.

===Oil and gas exploration and production===
Before the divestment of its oil and gas upstream assets to Ineos in 2017, DONG Energy&#x27;s core areas of oil and gas exploration and production lay in the southern part of the Norwegian North Sea and the Danish part of the North Sea, Barents Sea, west of Shetland, and in the central region of Norway (gas production). The reserve base was expected to be of oil equivalent.
In 2016, it produced of oil equivalent.

In 2016, DONG Energy agreed to sell its oil and gas pipelines to Energinet.dk.
It owned oil and gas pipelines which extend from the Danish part of the North Sea to Nybro and the Swedish gas transmission network (Nova Naturgas). DONG Energy co-owned the Tyra West – F3 pipeline pipelines, which create a link from the North Sea Danish section to the Netherlands natural gas hub in Den Helder, the DEUDAN pipeline from Jutland to north of Hamburg in Germany, and the Langeled pipeline from Nyhamna terminal in Norway to Easington in the UK. DONG Energy also owned a share of the Norwegian gas pipeline system.

===Power production===
Ørsted is the largest power producer in Denmark with market shares of 49% for electricity production and 35% for heat production. It also owns power production facilities and projects in Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.

Ørsted is the largest offshore wind farm company in the world with a market share of 16%.
Ørsted surpassed 1,000 offshore wind turbines in 2016.
In Denmark, it operates the 209 MW Horns Rev 2 offshore wind farm.
In the United Kingdom Ørsted operates Barrow and Burbo Bank offshore windfarms and will construct Walney and Gunfleet Sands I and II wind farms.
In addition, it is building the world largest wind farms, the 1,200 MW Hornsea 1 and the 1,386 MW Hornsea 2.
In North America it is a joint-venture partner in multiple proposed offshore wind projects, including the Block Island Wind Farm, Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind, and Sunrise Wind, all off the southern coast of New England.
The company was also developing Ocean Wind, an offshore wind farm on the Atlantic coast near Atlantic City, New Jersey, until it was cancelled in October 2023, and Skipjack Wind, southeast of the mouth of Delaware Bay. The company also has interests in onshore wind farms in Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Illinois.

Ørsted was until 2017 the largest shareholder (51%) of offshore wind turbine installer A2SEA, while Siemens owns the other 49%.
Ørsted also has 30% of subsea cabling installer CT Offshore.

Ørsted has been developing Borssele 1 and 2 wind farms in the Netherlands since 2021.

== Shareholders ==
Ørsted is listed at the Nasdaq Copenhagen stock exchange. The Danish Government holds the majority of Ørsted shares (50.1%). Capital Group Companies, EuroPacific Growth Fund&#x27;s, and SEAS-NVE holds over 5% of shares. According to a political agreement, the Danish Government shall maintain a majority in the company until 2025. Reduction of the ownership below 50% requires political agreement of Danish parties.

<text>The Adventist University of the Philippines is a private Protestant coeducational higher education institution located in Silang, Cavite, Philippines. The university is affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It holds an autonomous status granted by the Commission on Higher Education.

It is part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world&#x27;s second largest Christian school system.

==History==
The Adventist University of the Philippines was established by Seventh-day Adventist Church missionaries. In 1915, A. G. Daniels visited the Philippines and laid plans for the organization of an academic institution. Daniels was followed by L. V. Finster who reported that in 1916, I. A. Steinel and O. F. Sevrens and their families had arrived to supervise the establishment of the Philippine Seventh-day Adventist Academy on a five-acre land located along Calle Luna in Pasay, then part of the province of Rizal. The school formally opened on June 12, 1917, with 24 boys and 12 girls. The sole school building had classrooms on the first floor and a dormitory for the boys on the second floor. The girls stayed in an old mixed-material house which already existed on the land.

In 1925, at the Spring Council of the Far Eastern Division, it was voted that the academy be authorized to carry fourteen grades, adding one grade each year toward 1927, and that the name be changed to Philippine Junior College. Elder W. B. Amundsen was elected principal in 1927 until 1931.

At the end of 1927, 26 hectares of land was purchased in Baesa, Caloocan, then part of the province of Rizal, to accommodate the increasing student population. Prof. L. M. Stump, president of the college in 1931 directed the construction of the school buildings. In 1932, the school moved to the Baesa Campus. In that same year, FED permitted the junior college&#x27;s elevation to a senior one, naming it the Philippine Union College (PUC). The school song, &quot;Shine on Forever&quot;, was composed in 1933.

The growing enrollment inspired the administration to purchase a bigger property comprising 165 hectares of land located at Putting Kahoy, Silang, in the province of Cavite, in 1972. The year 1979 saw the first batch of freshmen and sophomore students at this new campus and in 1981, with the movement of the juniors and seniors from Baesa, the campus transfer was completed.

On August 1, 1996, in accordance with Republic Act No. 7722 and by virtue of Resolution No. 132-96, Series of 1996, the Commission on Higher Education granted PUC &quot;university&quot; status, entailing the change of the school&#x27;s name from Philippine Union College to Adventist University of the Philippines (AUP).

The university acquired &quot;deregulated&quot; status on October 22, 2001, and was awarded &quot;autonomous&quot; status on October 27, 2003.

Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Nursing Programs are accredited Level IV; Accountancy, Master in Business Administration and Master of Arts in Education Programs are accredited Level IV; PhD Education is accredited Level 3 by the Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities Accrediting Agency, Inc. (ACSCU-AAI).

AUP is accredited as a Level IV institution by the United States–based Accrediting Association of Seventh-day Adventist Schools, Colleges and Universities.

On June 1, 2022, Dr. Arceli H. Rosario officially took office as the eighteenth and first woman president of the university. Her investiture ceremony took place on June 27, 2022.

==Academic divisions==
The university consists of nine colleges:
*College of Arts and Humanities
*College of Business
*College of Dentistry
*College of Education
*College of Health
*College of Medicine

<text>Podhale (; ), sometimes referred to as the Polish Highlands, is Poland&#x27;s southernmost region. The Podhale is located in the foothills of the Tatra range of the Carpathian Mountains. It is the most famous region of the Goral Lands which are a network of historical regions inhabited by Gorals.

== Local folklore ==
The region is characterized by its unique folklore, which is distinct from other folk cultures in Poland. Its folklore was brought there mainly by settlers from the Lesser Poland region further north and partly by Wallachian (Vlach) settlers in the centuries during their migrations. The name Podhale literally translates as &quot;below the mountains&quot; in English. It is a combination of two words. In the górals dialect, the Alpine tundra is called hala (plural: hale), &quot;pod&quot; in Polish is the English &quot;under&quot;.

The various Goral dialects of Polish as well as standard Polish are spoken in the region.

==Regional attractions==
Among the region&#x27;s attractions are the popular mountain resort of Zakopane and the lake known as Morskie Oko (&quot;The Eye of the Sea&quot;), which local legend claims, is connected to the Adriatic by subterranean passageways. Nowy Targ along the Dunajec River, located in the valley beneath the Gorce Mountains, is the capital of the region. Ludzmierz is home to the area&#x27;s oldest shrine, Our Lady of Ludźmierz also known as the Hostess of Podhale or in Goral &quot;Gaździna Podholańsko&quot;.

The people in this region are particularly famous for their oscypek, a cheese made from a mix of cow&#x27;s and sheep&#x27;s milk, their music, and their ski slopes. In the winter, it is the number one tourist site in Poland.

<doc id="1205754" wikidata="Q919217" url="?curid=1205754" title="Z Application Assist Processor">
<text>The IBM [[System z]] Application Assist Processor (zAAP), previously known as the zSeries Application Assist Processor, is a mainframe processor introduced by IBM in 2004. zAAP engines are dedicated to running specific Java and XML workloads under z/OS, accelerating performance. zAAPs are available for zSeries 990 and 890 servers and later zSeries and zEnterprise models. Beginning with the IBM z13, the zAAP functionality is integrated with zIIP processors (zAAP on zIIP).

Currently a zAAP engine contains the same underlying hardware as any other mainframe engine. However, IBM uses microcode to limit code execution to Java and XML workloads only. As with Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) and zIIP, zAAPs are not specifically optimized to run Java faster or better. IBM does not change the &quot;software model&quot; or MSU rating on its mainframes with the installation of zAAPs. Consequently, IBM&#x27;s customers do not incur software license charges for their zAAPs, reducing their costs of running Java- and XML-oriented applications. The number of zAAPs cannot exceed the number of central processors (CPs, general purpose engines) within a zSeries/z9 machine.

IBM made the zAAP feature (i.e. the microcode) generally available on June 30, 2004, although the required z/OS release was not generally available until September 24, 2004. zAAPs work with z/OS V1R6 and higher, and Java 1.4.1 and higher. IBM modified the z/OS dispatcher and Workload Manager (WLM) to switch pure Java workload to the dedicated engines. These modifications are completely transparent to Java applications. However, because Java must at least occasionally call native system services (I/O services, for example), some conventional processor (CP) capacity must be available to initiate and sustain a zAAP engine. Major software subsystems that could benefit from zAAP (i.e. that rely on Java workloads) include WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere Business Integration Server Foundation, WebSphere Process Server, WebSphere Message Broker, Db2, CICS Transaction Server, CICS Transaction Gateway, IMS, and (JZOS and z/OS UNIX System Services) Batch, among others. In 2007, IBM added zAAP support to the XML System Services for z/OS, so now products such as DB2 9 for z/OS can also take advantage of zAAPs for XML-related processing.

The first commercial production workload for zAAP began on September 1, 2004, at an undisclosed Midwestern U.S. insurance company performing claims processing. The company used Java 1.4.2, WebSphere Application Server Version 5.1, and a near-final z/OS V1R6 build on a zSeries 990 (2084-304/A08 with two zAAPs). This deployment is probably a mainframe record for speed of both development and adoption, since IBM only began its zAAP design project in 2003. 

==Support for zAAPs==

Third-party independent software vendors (ISVs) have introduced support for execution of their products on zAAP Specialty Engines by using Java or XML Services toolkit from IBM.

For example, Ivory Server for z/OS and Ivory Server for CICS from GT Software, Inc. provide zAAP support for XML parsing using the optional IBM z/OS XML Services feature. The Ivory Server for Java will also take advantage of the zAAP in addition to supporting zIIP and the Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL).

<text>John Goodwin (1594–1665) was an English preacher, Puritan theologian and prolific author of significant books.

==Early life==
Goodwin was born in Norfolk and educated at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. and obtained a fellowship on 10 November 1617. He left the university and married, took orders and was a popular preacher in his home county and later in London. In 1622 he was the incumbent at East Raynham where he benefited from a bequest by Anne Townshend. For a time he seems to have officiated at St. Mary&#x27;s, Dover. In 1632 he came to London, and on 18 December 1633 was instituted to the vicarage of St. Stephen&#x27;s, Coleman Street, vacated by the nonconformist secession of John Davenport. He himself sided with the puritans, and at that period inclined to independency under the influence of John Cotton.

In 1635 he was convened for breach of canons, but on his promise of amendment Bishop William Juxon took no further proceedings. In 1638 Goodwin broached from the pulpit of St. Stephen&#x27;s his opinions on justification by faith, taking a view which was already regarded as practically Arminian; he always cited Calvin as bearing him out on some points. A pulpit controversy with other city ministers on this topic was calmed by Juxon, all parties agreeing to desist. Next year (1639) Goodwin angered his opponents anew by insisting on the need of a learned ministry. Juxon reported to William Laud that he did not despair of a good issue. Goodwin had a hand in drafting the London clerical petition against the new canons of 30 June 1640. Alderman Isaac Pennington was one of his parishioners, and joined his congregational society.

In 1639 Goodwin wrote a preface to the posthumous sermons of Henry Ramsden. During the next two years he published several sermons, and a tract (1641) criticising the positions of George Walker, of St. John&#x27;s, Watling Street. Walker retorted upon Goodwin and others with a charge of Socinianism in the article of justification.

==Civil War period==
Goodwin was one of the earliest clerical supporters of the democratic puritans, and then of the army against the Parliament. His &quot;Anti-Cavalierisme&quot; (1642) proclaims the need of war to suppress the party &#x27;now hammering England to make an Ireland of it.&#x27; The doctrine of the divine right of kings he assailed in his &quot;Os Ossorianum, or a Bone for a Bishop&quot;, against Griffith Williams, bishop of Ossory. He also attacked the presbyterians as a persecuting party in his &quot;Θεομαχία, or the grand imprudence of ... fighting against God&quot; (1644). In May 1645 he was ejected from his living for refusing to administer indiscriminately in his parish the baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, setting up a covenanted community within his parish. Goodwin immediately set up an independent church in Coleman Street, which had a large following. William Taylor, his appointed successor at St. Stephen&#x27;s, was in his turn ejected in 1649, to be restored in 1657. Goodwin obtained the use of the church, but with a diminished revenue. Among his hearers at this period was Thomas Firmin, who took down his sermons in shorthand.

The &quot;Gangraena&quot; (1646) of Thomas Edwards included Goodwin among the subjects of attack; in the second and third parts, published in the same year, Edwards was provoked into savage onslaughts by Goodwin&#x27;s anonymous reply &quot;Cretensis&quot;. Goodwin is &#x27;a monstrous sectary, a compound of Socinianism, Arminianism, antinomianism, independency, popery, yea and of scepticism.&#x27; He and several of his church &#x27;go to bowls and other sports on days of public thanksgiving.&#x27; &quot;Cretensis&quot; also defended Jeremiah Burroughs and William Greenhill whom Goodwin knew, and also Robert Cosens and John Ellis where the connection was prompted by Edwards (who hit back at them all bracketed together). Goodwin, by his &quot;Hagiomastix, or the Scourge of the Saints&quot; (1647) came into collision with William Jenkyn, vicar of Christ Church, Newgate, whose &quot;Testimony&quot; was endorsed (14 December 1647) by fifty-eight presbyterian divines at Sion College. Sixteen members of Goodwin&#x27;s church issued an &quot;Apologetical Account&quot; (1647) of their reasons for standing by him.

Jenkyn was aided by John Vicars, usher in Christ Church Hospital, who published (1648) an amusing description of &#x27;Coleman-street-conclave&#x27; and its minister, &#x27;this most huge Garagantua,&#x27; the &#x27;schismatics cheater in chief.&#x27; This contains a likeness of Goodwin (engraved by William Richardson) surmounted by a windmill and weathercock, &#x27;pride&#x27; and &#x27;error&#x27; supplying the breeze.

Goodwin translated and printed a part of the &quot;Stratagemata Satanae&quot; (March 1648) of Acontius under the title &quot;Satan&#x27;s Stratagems; or the Devil&#x27;s Cabinet-Councel discovered&quot;, with recommendatory epistles by himself and John Durie. Acontius, an advocate of religious tolerance, was now stigmatised by Francis Cheynell as a &#x27;sneaking Socinian&#x27;. Cheynell sought in vain in the Westminster Assembly to obtain a condemnation of Goodwin&#x27;s book, but printed (1650) his thoughts about it by request. The translation was reissued with a new title, &quot;Darkness Discovered; or the Devil&#x27;s secret Stratagems laid open&quot; (1651).

Goodwin defended the most extreme measures of the army leaders. In his &quot;Might and Right Well Met&quot; (1648), which was answered by John Geree, he applauded Pride&#x27;s Purge. He was one of the puritan divines who, in the interval between the sentence and execution of the king, offered him their spiritual services. Goodwin mentions in his &quot;Ὑβριστοδίκαι. The Obstrvctovrs of Justice&quot; (30 May 1649), that he had an hour&#x27;s conversation or more with Charles, but was not impressed by his visit. He firmly contended in the same tract for the sovereign rights of the people, quoted approvingly John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Tenure of Kings and Magistrates&quot; (13 February 1649), and maintained that the proceedings against Charles followed the spirit of the law if not the letter. &quot;Two Hymns or Spiritual Songs&quot; (1651) were sung in his congregation on 24 October 1651, the thanksgiving day for the victory at the Battle of Worcester.

Meanwhile, he pursued theological controversies. His defense of general redemption, &quot;Ἀπολύτρωσις ἀπολύτρωσεως, or Redemption Redeemed&quot;, appeared in 1651 (reprinted 1840); his &quot;Water-Dipping no Firm Footing&quot; (1653) and &quot;Cata-Baptism&quot; (1655) were polemics against baptists. The circumstance that Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s &#x27;Triers&#x27; were mostly independents did not reconcile him to the new ecclesiastical despotism; he arraigned it in his &quot;Bασανισταί. Or the Triers [or Tormenters] Tried&quot; (1657).

Goodwin speaks of himself as having to contend in a manner with the whole earth&#x27; (dedication to &quot;Cata-Baptism&quot;). His ideas were often anticipations. His rational temper made him the opponent of Seekers and Quakers, and gave him some affinity with the Cambridge Platonists. He rejected the distinction allowed by Acontius, between tolerance of error in fundamentals and in other points. He would have men &#x27;call more for light and less for fire from heaven&#x27; (epistle in &quot;Satan&#x27;s Stratagems&quot;, 1648). In his &quot;Divine Authority of the Scriptures Asserted&quot; (1648), which won the commendation of Richard Baxter, he maintains, anticipating George Fox and Robert Barclay, that the word of God &#x27;was extant in the world, nay in the hearts and consciences of men, before there was any copy of the word extant in writing.&#x27; In his &quot;Pagans Debt and Dowry&quot; (1651; 1671, a reply to Thomas Barlow), which led to a controversy with Obadiah Howe, he argues that without the letter of the gospel heathens may be saved.

Goodwin was also a believer in the future calling of the Jews and was a millenarian. His views are expressed in &quot;A Post-Script or Appendix to&quot; [. . .] &quot;Hagiomastix&quot; (1647). A member of Goodwin&#x27;s gathered congregation, Daniel Taylor, later petitioned Oliver Cromwell for the readmission of the Jews to England in a treatise entitled &quot;Certain Queries&quot; (1651).

==After the Restoration==
At the Restoration Goodwin, with John Milton, was ordered into custody on 16 June 1660. He kept out of the way, and at length was placed in the indemnity, among eighteen persons perpetually incapacitated for any public trust. His &quot;Ὑβριστοδίκαι&quot; was burned (27 August) by the hangman at the Old Bailey. According to Gilbert Burnet, his comparative immunity was due to his Arminian reputation.

He soon returned to his Coleman Street congregation, though not to the emoluments of St. Stephen&#x27;s, of which he was deprived and Theophilus Alford admitted as his successor, on 29 May 1661. He had written strenuously against the Fifth-monarchy men in 1654 and 1655; but Thomas Venner&#x27;s meeting house, from which Venner&#x27;s Rising proceeded, was in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, and here also, in 1653, was Goodwin&#x27;s study. This may explain why Burnet wrote that Goodwin was one of these enthusiasts. Immediately on Venner&#x27;s rising, Goodwin&#x27;s church issued a &quot;Declaration&quot; (January 1661) disclaiming all sympathy with this or any attempt &#x27;to propagate religion by the sword.&#x27;

Goodwin was named as one of the men who was excluded from holding any state office in the Indemnity and Oblivion Act 1660. He died in the plague year, 1665. By his early marriage he had seven children, two of whom died in 1645.

<doc id="1205762" wikidata="Q7869487" url="?curid=1205762" title="USS Franklin (1775)">
<text>The first &quot;USS Franklin&quot; was a schooner in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War. She was named for Benjamin Franklin.

&quot;Franklin&quot; was originally a Marblehead fishing vessel fitted out by order of Colonel George Washington in 1775. She was part of the fleet of schooners under Commodore John Manley that captured numerous British vessels.

In October 1775, &quot;Hancock&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; were ordered to intercept two brigs as they arrived in the St. Lawrence River from England. But the two schooners instead sought easier quarry off Cape Canso where five prizes of dubious legality were taken. They also raided Charlottetown settlement without regard to orders to respect Canadian property. The story of their illegal actions reached General Washington who dismissed both ship commanders and returned their prizes to Canadian owners with apologies.

On May 17, 1776, commanded by Capt. James Mugford, the &quot;Franklin&quot; surprised and captured the British ordnance ship, &quot;Hope&quot;, which was headed to Nantasket Roads in Boston Harbor carrying 1,500 barrels of gunpowder, 1,000 carbines and other material. Mugford ran &quot;Hope&quot; to shore at or near Boston to offload the cargo, which was badly needed by the Continental Army. Then, on May 19, &quot;Franklin&quot; set sail again in company with a privateer, &quot;Lady Washington&quot; under Captain Cunningham. With the tide against them, Mugford anchored for the night near Nantasket, Massachusetts. At daybreak thirteen launches from the British fleet approached, anxious for revenge for the taking of the &quot;Hope&quot;. The Americans managed to sink five launches on approach, then, in close combat in which Mugford was killed by a musket ball, the &quot;Franklin&quot; was run ashore to set up defenses, after which the launches were repelled. The British lost seventy of about 200 men, and Mugford was the only American killed in the engagement.

&quot;Franklin&quot; was returned to her original owner later in 1776.

<text>The Solid Gold Sound of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band represents the university at major athletic and extracurricular events. During the fall marching season, this 250-member band performs at the Rose Bowl for UCLA Bruin home football games. Pregame shows by the band aim to build crowd energy and enthusiasm with traditional UCLA songs like &quot;Strike Up the Band for UCLA&quot;, &quot;Bruin Warriors&quot;, and &quot;The Mighty Bruins&quot;. Throughout the game, the band performs custom-arranged rock and pop songs, as well as the traditional fight songs and cheers of the university. The UCLA Varsity Band appears at basketball games and other athletic contests in Pauley Pavilion. In 2018, the Bruin Marching Band was featured on the Muse album &quot;Simulation Theory&quot; performing the Super Deluxe version of the song &quot;Pressure.&quot;

The UCLA band program, which includes the Marching and Varsity Bands, the Wind Ensemble and the Symphonic Band, is in the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. Band appearances at athletic events are funded primarily by student registration fees, a direct allocation from the Chancellor&#x27;s Office and donations to the Solid Gold Sound Club.

In 1993, the UCLA Bruin Marching Band was awarded the Sudler Trophy, an award bestowed on one university marching band every year. Described by a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter as &quot;[t]he Heisman Trophy of the collegiate band world&quot;, the award does not represent the winner of any championship, but rather a band surrounded by great music and tradition that has become respected nationally.

All marching members and teaching assistants in the Bruin Marching Band are full-time UCLA students.

==Style==
The UCLA Marching Band marches in a style with low mark times and glide steps. Field formations include fast moving precision drill progressions, letter blocks, pictures, concert arcs, and the famous Cursive UCLA formation. The band performs many different styles of shows, depending upon the occasion.

The exception to the drum corps marching style is the traditional pregame &quot;run-on&quot; where the band rapidly high-steps onto the field into the block letter U-C-L-A formation.

==History==
In 1925, at the Vermont Avenue campus, the UCLA Marching Band originated as a 50-piece ROTC unit under the direction of W. G. Powell. The band was part of the welcoming group when John Philip Sousa visited Los Angeles in 1928, and were directed by Sousa in the performance of &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. At that time, the director was Ben Laietsky, a member of Sousa&#x27;s band. The band remained a military group until 1934. In 1935, under the direction of Leroy Allen, the group became an integral part of campus life, providing music at rallies and games. The original uniforms were military style, with military caps and waist-length capes.

Under directors C. B. Hunt and Patton McNaughton, the band increased in size to 128 members by 1947.

===Clarence Sawhill and Kelly James 1952-1982===
In 1952, Clarence Sawhill became director of bands. F. (Freeman) Kelly James became the director of the marching band, a position he would hold until suffering a stroke at the UCLA-Cal football game in 1980. Sawhill and James grew the UCLA band program to include a 100-piece Concert Band, an 80-piece Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a 144-piece Marching Band, and a 60-piece Varsity Band.

In the 1950s the UCLA Marching Band uniforms were gold/yellow jackets with navy blue pants, blue shakos and white shoes. The band marched in a military style. The band appeared in color on the cover of the November 26, 1956 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. It is one of the few so honored beginning with the University of Oklahoma marching band (1954), the Princeton University Band (1955), and later, The Ohio State University Marching Band (1958). This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine.

In the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the Queen&#x27;s Guard. The band had a similar marching style, including the distinctive arm swinging, but also having the high &quot;chair&quot; step. The uniform pants were school colors blue and black trim, and imitation bearskin (or tall busby) hats. In the early 1960s, the uniform coats were gold. later the uniform coats were dark blue. The shoes were black with white spats.

In 1961, the band made a European Tour which included performances in Denmark, France, Austria, Germany, England and Switzerland.

In 1972, women were admitted to the UCLA Band, as well as other college marching bands around the country as a response to the Title IX educational amendment. Many marching bands, including the UCLA Band, had women members or a women&#x27;s auxiliary unit during World War II, but the bands gradually became all-male organizations after the war.

In 1973, the band wore gold jackets, navy blue pants, navy blue turtleneck sweaters, and no hat, for one game. They were never used after that.

In 1977, the school purchased new uniforms that were royal blue with yellow trim. The large overcoats had a white front with block vertical UCLA letters. There were tall white plush busby hats with blue and yellow plumes.

===Thomas Lee and Gordon Henderson===
In 1982, Gordon Henderson was appointed Director of the Marching and Varsity Bands. 

In 1985, the band ordered newly designed uniforms, in the current military style. These uniforms were designed with band member input to replace the brightly colored 1977 uniforms. The uniforms consisted of navy blue wool trousers and coat with gold trim and white, knee-length, gold capes on the left shoulder. The shoes were changed to white. White gloves were standard as well. The large bearskin hats were replaced by Shako hats with white 12&quot; feather plumes. An all-powder blue uniform was prototyped, but rejected in favor of the navy blue. The color guard did wear powder blue uniform coats and skirts similar in style to the new uniforms for two years.

In 2007 the band was outfitted with new uniforms at the USC game. The coats were the then official &quot;True Blue&quot; color adopted by UCLA in 2004. Other elements from the 1985 uniforms were retained.

In 1985, Thomas Lee came from the University of Texas to be the Director of Bands and Director of the Wind Ensemble.

The UCLA Bruin Marching Band was the 1993 recipient of the Sudler Trophy, presented by the John Philip Sousa Foundation in recognition of the Band&#x27;s tradition of excellence and innovation.

The band became part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music in 2007 when the departments of Music, Ethnomusicology and Musicology were combined. Musician and recording executive Herb Alpert gave $30 million to UCLA in November 2007, the single largest individual gift to music higher education in the western United States.

Lee retired from UCLA in 2012, and Dr. Travis Cross was appointed the new Wind Ensemble conductor in 2013.

Henderson retired in 2020 as Director of Bands after 38 years of service to UCLA.

===Ken Fisher===
Ken Fisher was appointed the new Marching Band Director in 2023.

==Traditions==
For the football pregame show, the UCLA Marching Band traditionally opens with the &quot;Bruin Fanfare&quot;, an adaptation of the &quot;20th Century Fox Fanfare.&quot; Then follows &quot;Strike Up The Band for UCLA,&quot; a gift from George and Ira Gershwin to UCLA. It was adapted from their showtune &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot;, and was presented to UCLA at an All-University Sing held in Royce Hall during Fall 1936. The &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; is played by the band in concert formation. Then the band moves into the script UCLA formation to the tune of &quot;Bruin Warriors&quot;. The band marches off the field to &quot;The Mighty Bruins&quot;, composed in 1984 by Academy Award-winning composer Bill Conti to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UCLA Alumni Association.

Following all athletic contests, the band plays the UCLA Alma Mater &quot;Hail to the Hills of Westwood&quot;. After victories, this is followed by &quot;Rover&quot;.

<text>Michael Madhusudan Dutt (; 25 January 1824 – 29 June 1873) was a Bengali poet and playwright. He is considered one of the pioneers of Bengali literature.

==Early life==
Madhusudan was born in Sagardari, a village in Keshabpur Upazila, Jessore District of Bengal (present-day Bangladesh), to a Hindu family. His father was Rajnarayan Dutt and his mother was Jahnabi Devi. His family being reasonably well-off, assured that Madhusudan received an education in the English language and additional tutorship in English at home. Rajnarayan had intended for this Western education to open the doors for a government position for his son.

==College and religious conversion==
After he finished his education in Sagardari at roughly the age of fifteen, Rajnarayan sent Madhusudhan to Calcutta to attend Hindu College with the eventual aim of becoming a barrister. At Hindu College, Michael studied under a westernized curriculum in a university which had been expressly founded for the &quot;uplift of the natives&quot;. The university stipulated that all students had to dress in Western clothing, eat European cuisine using cutlery, learn British songs and speak only English with the aim of creating an anglicized middle class of Indians who would serve as officials in the colonial administration. During his time at Hindu College, Madhusudhan developed an aversion to Indian culture and a deep yearning to become accepted into European culture. He expressed these sentiments in one of his poems. An early and formative influence on Dutt was his teacher at Hindu College, David Lester Richardson. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly Byron. Dutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. They were, however, never accepted for publication. This was also the time when he began a correspondence with his friend, Gour Das Bysack, which today forms the bulk of sources on his life.

Madhusudan embraced Christianity at the Old Mission Church, in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives, on 9 February 1843. He did not take the name Michael until his marriage in 1848.

He describes the day as:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Long sunk in superstition&#x27;s night,
By Sin and Satan driven,
I saw not, cared not for the light
That leads the blind to Heaven.
But now, at length thy grace, O Lord!
Birds all around me shine;
I drink thy sweet, thy precious word,
I kneel before thy shrine!
&lt;/poem&gt;

He had to leave Hindu College on account of being a convert. In 1844, he resumed his education at Bishop&#x27;s College, where he stayed for three years.

In 1847, he moved to Madras (Chennai) due to family tensions and economic hardship, having been disinherited by his father. While in Madras, he stayed in the Black Town neighbourhood, and began working as an &quot;usher&quot; at the Madras Male Orphan Asylum. Four years later, in 1851, he became a Second Tutor in the Madras University High School. He edited and assisted in editing the periodicals &quot;Madras Circulator and General Chronicle, Athenaeum, Spectator&quot; and &quot;Hindoo Chronicle.&quot;

==Literary life==

=== Early works (1849–1855) ===
Dutt wrote exclusively in English in his early writing years. The Captive Ladie was published in 1849 and, like Derozio&#x27;s The Fakeer of Jungheera, takes on the form of a long narrative poem. In &quot;The Anglo-Saxon and the Hindu&quot; (1854), an essay in florid, even purple prose, are references to and quotations from almost the whole of Macaulay&#x27;s shelf of European books. He was greatly influenced by the works of William Wordsworth and John Milton. Dutt was a spirited bohemian and Romantic.

=== Calcutta years (1858–1862) ===
The period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of Bethune and Bysack. He wrote 5 plays: &quot;Sermista&quot; (1859)&quot;, Padmavati&quot; (1859)&quot;, Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata&quot; (1860), &quot;Krishna Kumari&quot; (1860) &quot;and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron&quot; (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: &quot;Tilottama Sambhava Kavya&quot; (1861), &quot;Meghnad Badh Kavya&quot; (1861), &quot;Brajagana Kavya&quot; (1861) and &quot;Veerangana Kavya&quot; (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own &quot;Sermista&quot;.

=== Final years (1866–1873) ===
A volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866. His final play, &quot;Maya Kannan&quot;, was written in 1872. &quot;The Slaying of Hector&quot;, his prose version of the &quot;Iliad&quot; remains incomplete.

=== Linguistic abilities ===
Madhusudan was a gifted linguist and polyglot. He studied English, Bengali, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Tamil, Telugu, and Sanskrit.

===Work with the sonnet===
Michael Madhusudan Dutt dedicated his first sonnet to his friend Rajnarayan Basu, which he accompanied with a letter: &quot;What say you to this, my good friend? In my humble opinion, if cultivated by men of genius, our sonnet in time would rival the Italian.&quot; His most famous sonnet is &quot;Kapatakkha River&quot;.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Always, o river, you peep in my mind.
Always I think you in this loneliness.
Always I soothe my ears with the murmur
Of your waters in illusion, the way
Men hear songs of illusion in a dream.
Many a river I have seen on earth;
But which can quench my thirst the way you do?
You&#x27;re the flow of milk in my homeland&#x27;s breasts.
Will I meet you ever? As long as you
Go to kinglike ocean to pay the tax
Of water, I beg to you, sing my name
Into the ears of people of Bengal,
Sing his name, o dear, who in this far land
Sings your name in all his songs for Bengal.
&lt;/poem&gt;

When Dutt later stayed in Versailles, the sixth centenary of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri was being celebrated all over Europe. He composed a poem in honour of the poet, translated it into French and Italian, and sent it to the king of Italy. Victor Emmanuel II, then monarch, liked the poem and wrote to Dutt, saying, &quot;It will be a ring which will connect the Orient with the Occident.&quot;

===Work in blank verse===
&quot;Sharmistha&quot; (spelt as &quot;Sermista&quot; in English) was Dutt&#x27;s first attempt at blank verse in Bengali literature. Kaliprasanna Singha organised a felicitation ceremony for Madhusudan to mark the introduction of blank verse in Bengali poetry. His famous epic, quoted as the only epic of Bengali kind, Meghnadbad-Kabya is also totally written in blank verse.

Praising Dutt&#x27;s blank verse, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, observed: &quot;As long as the Bengali race and Bengali literature would exist, the sweet lyre of Madhusudan would never cease playing.&quot; He added: &quot;Ordinarily, reading of poetry causes a soporific effect, but the intoxicating vigour of Madhusudan&#x27;s poems makes even a sick man sit up on his bed.&quot;

In his &quot;The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian&quot;, Nirad C. Chaudhuri has remarked that during his childhood days in Kishoreganj, a common standard for testing guests&#x27; erudition in the Bengali language during family gatherings was to require them to recite the poetry of Dutt, without an accent.
== Barrister-at-law ==
Dutt went to England in 1862 to become a barrister-at-law and enrolled at the Gray&#x27;s Inn.

On the eve of his departure to England:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Forget me not, O Mother,
Should I fail to return
To thy hallowed bosom.
Make not the lotus of thy memory
Void of its nectar honey.
(Translated from the original Bengali by the poet.)
&lt;/poem&gt;

His family joined him in 1863, and thereafter they shifted to the much cheaper Versailles, due to the miserable state of their finances. Funds were not arriving from India according to his plans. He was only able to relocate to England in 1865 and study for the bar due to the generosity of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. For this, Dutt was to regard Vidyasagar as &quot;Dayar Sagar&quot; (meaning &quot;the ocean of kindness&quot;) for as long as he lived. He was admitted to the High Court in Calcutta on his return in February 1867. His family followed him in 1869.

His stay in England had left him disillusioned with European culture. He wrote to his friend Bysack from France: 

==Marriage and family==
Dutt had refused to enter into an arranged marriage which his father had decided for him. He had no respect for that tradition and wanted to break free from the confines of caste-based endogamous marriage. His knowledge of the European tradition convinced him of his choice of marriages made by mutual consent (or love marriages).

While in Madras, he married Rebecca Thompson McTavish, a 17-year-old of Scottish parentage, a resident of the Madras Female Orphan Asylum, on 31 July 1848. Dutt assumed the name Michael when the marriage was registered in the baptismal register. They had four children together. He wrote to Bysack in December 1855:

Dutt returned from Madras to Calcutta in February 1856, after his father&#x27;s death (in 1855), abandoning his wife and four children in Madras. No records of his divorce from Rebecca or remarriage have been found. In 1858, he was joined there by a 22-year old of French extraction, Emelia Henrietta Sophie White, the daughter of his colleague at the Madras Male Orphan Asylum. They had two sons, Frederick Michael Milton (23 July 1861 – 11 June 1875) and Albert Napoleon (1869 – 22 August 1909), and a daughter, Henrietta Elizabeth Sermista (1859 – 15 February 1879). A fourth child was stillborn. Their relationship lasted until the end of his life, Henrietta pre-deceasing him by three days, on 26 June 1873.

Rebecca died in Madras in July 1892. Only a daughter and a son survived her. The son, McTavish-Dutt, practised as a pleader in the Court of Small Causes in Madras.

The tennis player Leander Paes is a direct descendant of Dutt, who is his great-great-grandson on his mother&#x27;s side.

==Death==
Dutt died in Presidency General Hospital on 29 June 1873. Three days before his death, he recited a passage from Shakespeare&#x27;s Macbeth to his dear friend Bysack, to express his deepest conviction of life:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
...out, out, brief candle!
Life&#x27;s but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot,
full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
&lt;/poem&gt;



==Legacy and honours==
Dutt was largely ignored for 15 years after his death. The belated tribute was a tomb erected at his gravesite.

His epitaph, a verse of his own, reads:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
Stop a while, traveller!
Should Mother Bengal claim thee for her son.
As a child takes repose on his mother&#x27;s elysian lap,
Even so here in the Long Home,
On the bosom of the earth,
Enjoys the sweet eternal sleep
Poet Madhusudan of the Duttas.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Michael Madhusudhan&quot; is a 1950 Indian Bengali-language drama film by Modhu Bose which starred Utpal Dutt in the titular role.

Author Namita Gokhale published a play about Madhusudhan in 2021, based largely on letters written by him to friends and other authors, called &quot;Betrayed by Hope&quot;.

In honour of Dutt, every year on his birthday, a fair is held in his home at Sagardari, which is organized by the District Council of Jessore. Every year, various MPs and ministers of the national parliament of Bangladesh attend this fair.

<text>William Thomas Jr. (March 12, 1931 – October 10, 1980) was an American child actor best remembered for portraying the character of Buckwheat in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; (&quot;Little Rascals&quot;) short films from 1934 until the series&#x27; end in 1944. He was a native of Los Angeles.

==&quot;Our Gang&quot;==
Billie Thomas first appeared in the 1934 &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake!, The First Round-Up,&quot; and &quot;Washee Ironee&quot; as a background player. The &quot;Buckwheat&quot; character was a girl at this time, portrayed by &quot;Our Gang&quot; kid Matthew &quot;Stymie&quot; Beard&#x27;s younger sister Carlena in &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake!&quot;, and by Willie Mae Walton in three other shorts.

Thomas began appearing as &quot;Buckwheat&quot; with 1935&#x27;s &quot;Mama&#x27;s Little Pirate&quot;. Despite Thomas being a boy, the Buckwheat character remained a girl—dressed as a Topsy-esque image of the African-American &quot;pickaninny&quot; stereotype with bowed pigtails, a large hand-me-down sweater and oversized boots. After Stymie&#x27;s departure from the series later in 1935, the Buckwheat character slowly morphed into a boy, first referred to definitively as a &quot;he&quot; in 1936&#x27;s &quot;The Pinch Singer&quot;. This is similar to the initial handling of another African-American &quot;Our Gang&quot; member, Allen &quot;Farina&quot; Hoskins, who worked in the series during the silent and early sound eras.

Despite the change in the Buckwheat character&#x27;s gender, Billie Thomas&#x27;s androgynous costuming was not changed until his appearance in the 1936 film &quot;Pay as You Exit&quot;. This new costuming – overalls, striped shirt, oversized shoes, and a large unkempt afro – was retained for the series until the end. The reason for the change in appearance was so he could portray, in the 1936 &quot;Our Gang&quot; feature film &quot;General Spanky&quot;, a five-year-old slave asking men on a riverboat and, subsequently, shoeshine boy Spanky, &quot;You be my master?&quot;. In his &quot;Classic Movie Guide&quot; write-up for the film, Leonard Maltin surmises that &quot;Buckwheat&#x27;s role as slave in search of a master may displease contemporary audiences.&quot;
Thomas remained in &quot;Our Gang&quot; for ten years, appearing in all but one of the shorts, &quot;Feed &#x27;em and Weep&quot; (due to sickness; fellow child actor Philip Hurlic filled in for him), made from &quot;Washee Ironee&quot; in 1934 through the series&#x27; end in 1944. During the first half of his &quot;Our Gang&quot; tenure, Thomas&#x27;s Buckwheat character was often paired with Eugene &quot;Porky&quot; Lee as a tag-along team of &quot;little kids&quot; rallying against (and often outsmarting) the &quot;big kids&quot;, George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland and Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer. Thomas had a speech impairment as a young child, as did Lee, who became Thomas&#x27;s friend both on the set and off. The &quot;Buckwheat&quot; and &quot;Porky&quot; characters both became known for their collective garbled dialogue, in particular their catchphrase, &quot;O-tay!&quot; originally uttered by Porky, but soon used by both characters.

Thomas remained in &quot;Our Gang&quot; when the series changed production from Hal Roach Studios to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Thomas was the only cast member to appear in all 52 of the MGM-produced entries and was the only holdover from the Hal Roach era to remain in the series until its end in 1944. By 1940, Thomas had grown out of his speech impairment, and with Lee having been replaced by Robert Blake, Thomas&#x27;s Buckwheat character was written as an archetypal black youth. He was twelve years old when the final &quot;Our Gang&quot; film, &quot;Dancing Romeo&quot;, was completed in November 1943.

The character of Buckwheat in later years became synonymous with the derogatory &quot;pickaninny&quot; stereotype. However, the work of Thomas and the other black cast members as actors is credited with helping the cause of race relations by playing alongside white children and going to school with them as equals in a desegregated show during the height of the Jim Crow Era. According to Julia Lee, author of &quot;Our Gang: A Racial History of The Little Rascals&quot;, Thomas and the others were &quot;considered saviors in many ways&quot; by the black community as the most popular black stars in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Later, during the 1950s and 1960s, the NAACP fought against the tired and demeaning racial stereotypes found in some of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts and moved to have the &quot;Little Rascals&quot; syndication package taken off the air, settling instead for distributor King World Productions editing the shorts under the NAACP&#x27;s supervision.

==Later life==
Thomas enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1954 at the age of 23, and was released from active military service in 1956 decorated with a National Defense Service Medal and a Good Conduct Medal.

After returning to civilian life, Thomas faced a dilemma shared by many of his co-stars from &quot;Our Gang&quot;. Though offered many film and stage roles, he had no desire to return to Hollywood as an actor: “After the Army, I wasn&#x27;t really interested in the hassle of performing,&quot; he explained shortly before his death in 1980. &quot;Even the big stars had to chase around and audition; it seemed like a rat race to me, with no security.&quot;

However, Thomas still enjoyed the film industry at large, and learned the trade of film editing and cutting. He had a successful decades-long career as a film lab technician with the Technicolor corporation, processing negative film reels for motion pictures such as &quot;Jaws&quot;, and for Metrocolor, processing &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;.

Thomas was honored at &quot;Hollywood 80&quot;, the second annual meeting of The Sons of the Desert, from July 30 to August 3, 1980. More than 500 Laurel and Hardy fans gathered at the Los Angeles Hilton Hotel. Several days were spent touring famous Hollywood attractions, and then the highlight of the gathering took place in the hotel ballroom. Among those honored on July 31 were &quot;Our Gang&quot; performers George McFarland, Dorothy DeBorba, Tommy Bond, and Joe Cobb. When Thomas was brought out, he received a spontaneous standing ovation, and was moved to tears.

==Death==
On October 10, 1980, ten weeks after his July 31 appearance at the Hilton, Thomas died of a heart attack in his Los Angeles home at the age of 49. Thomas is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood.

==Legacy==
In 1950, Billie had a son whom he also named William Thomas Jr.

William Thomas Jr. the younger went on to graduate from California State Northridge University in 1975, then in 1992, created the Buckwheat Memorial Scholarship for students at Northridge in his honor. In 2010, he wrote the book &quot;&quot;Otay!&quot; The Billy &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas Story&quot;. On November 30, 2012, he died at the age of 62.

==Controversies==
Eddie Murphy performed a series of Buckwheat sketches on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the 1980s when he was a cast member, but Thomas&#x27;s co-star George McFarland, who played &quot;Spanky&quot; in &quot;Little Rascals&quot;, made it clear that he hated Murphy&#x27;s imitations: &quot;I didn&#x27;t care for them a bit. Mr. Murphy did a very poor imitation. He made Buckwheat into a stereotype that he wasn&#x27;t, at the expense of the people in his family who are still alive.&quot;

In 1990, the ABC newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot; aired a segment featuring a man named Bill English, then a grocery bagger in Arizona, who claimed to be the adult Buckwheat. English&#x27;s appearance prompted public objections from McFarland, who contacted media outlets following the broadcast to inform them that Thomas – the true Buckwheat – had been dead for ten years. Despite being confronted by McFarland on the television newsmagazine &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, English, who died four years later at the age of 60, refused to retreat from his claim, maintaining that he had originated the role of Buckwheat, with other actors playing the character only after he had left it.

The next week, &quot;20/20&quot; acknowledged on-air that English&#x27;s claim had been false, and apologized for the interview. The fallout from this incident included the resignation of a &quot;20/20&quot; producer and a negligence lawsuit filed by the son of William Thomas.

In July 2023, radio host Delk Kennedy of WKOM in Tennessee referred to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre as &quot;Buckwheat&quot;; when some listeners criticized Kennedy&#x27;s remarks he responded by saying the Buckwheat character was intelligent and his comment was a compliment.

<text>Peter Alan Laird (born January 27, 1954) is an American comic book writer and artist. He is best known for co-creating the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with writer and artist Kevin Eastman.

==Early life and career==
Laird was born on January 27, 1954, in North Adams, Massachusetts. Toward the end of 1983, Laird was earning just ten dollars an illustration from a local newspaper in Dover, New Hampshire. He was also doing illustrations for fanzines like &quot;The Oracle&quot;.

==&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;==
In May 1984, Laird and Kevin Eastman self-published the first black &amp; white issue of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, at an initial print run of 3000 copies for the forty-page oversized comic. It was largely funded by a loan from Eastman&#x27;s uncle, Quentin (the experience of which had a profound impact on Laird, and led indirectly to his later work with the Xeric Foundation), and published by the duo&#x27;s Mirage Studios, a name chosen because &quot;there wasn’t an actual studio, only kitchen tables and couches with lap boards.&quot; That first issue received a number of subsequent printings over the next few years, as the Turtles phenomenon began to take off.

Laird&#x27;s newspaper experience led to the duo creating &quot;a four-page press kit&quot;, that, according to &quot;Flaming Carrot&quot; creator Bob Burden&#x27;s own &quot;Mystery Men&quot; press-kit, included &quot;a story outline and artwork that they sent to 180 TV and radio stations,&quot; as well as both the Associated Press and United Press International. This led to widespread press coverage of both the TMNT property and Mirage Studios itself, creating &quot;a demand for the interestingly-titled comic that caught everyone by surprise.&quot; With the solicitation of their second issue, Eastman and Laird&#x27;s &quot;Turtles&quot; comic began a meteoric rise to success, bringing in advance orders of 15,000 copies. This, Eastman has been quoted as saying, &quot;basically ended up with us clearing a profit of two thousand dollars apiece. Which allowed us to write and draw stories full-time: it was enough to pay the rent, pay the bills, and buy enough macaroni and cheese and pencils to live on.&quot;

The &quot;Turtles&quot; phenomenon saw the duo invited to their first comics convention at the tenth annual Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1984, where they mingled with the likes of Larry Niven, Forrest J Ackerman and Fred Hembeck (among others). With their (November 1985) fifth issue, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; downsized to the more common American comics format and size, and the previous four issues were also reprinted in this size and format with new color covers. Also in 1985, Solson Publications released &quot;How To Draw Eastman and Laird&#x27;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.&quot; Solson would follow this up with the six issue &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Authorized Martial Arts Training Manual&quot; as well as one issue of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teach Karate&quot; volume in 1987.

===Unexpected success===

That the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; became such a success (and in such a short space of time) came as a surprise to both Eastman and Laird. Laird has stated on several occasions that:
…start[ing] the Turtles…was a goof; it was not anything we envisioned directing our lives in any way, shape, or form. It was like, ‘Hey, this looks like fun! Let&#x27;s self-publish it! Let&#x27;s see what happens!’...Suddenly, and just completely out of the blue, this Turtles phenomenon emerged. And really – from day one – just took over. It was a rapidly accelerating process which culminated in essentially taking over our lives. Completely. 

This led to increased pressures on the two creators (and the team which they formed to help them), including a prolonged period (about a year) of artist&#x27;s block in Laird. The &quot;incredible growth and complexity of the business&quot; that sprang up around their instantly-successful Turtles properties led to Laird&#x27;s &quot;suddenly discover[ing] to my horror that I no longer enjoyed drawing. It was a real shock, because if I ever had anything that I could rely on... it was that I loved to draw.&quot;

Laird and Eastman&#x27;s creations went on to become a popular cultural phenomenon, forcing both of them to take regular sabbaticals from the comic to deal with the day to day pressures of running what had become a multimedia franchise. Eastman sold his share of the franchise, with the exception of a small continuing income participation, to Laird and the Mirage Group on June 1, 2000. On March 1, 2008, Laird and Mirage bought out Eastman&#x27;s remaining rights and interest and the two went their separate ways. Concerning Eastman&#x27;s departure, Laird stated his belief that Eastman &quot;was just tired of it.&quot; On October 19, 2009, Laird sold the franchise to Viacom, the parent company of Nickelodeon, but still retains the rights to create and publish up to eighteen black-and-white comics based on the franchise per year.

==Animation==
Although ostensibly over-seeing the animated &quot;Turtles&quot; projects through Mirage, Laird had minimal hands-on involvement in the development of the original animated series, and even less with the Next Mutation series. One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next &quot;TMNT&quot; animated venture, acting as &quot;a consultant, and... working with the guy I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine.&quot; In this role, he says &quot;[f]rom the get-go I&#x27;ve been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings. I&#x27;ve been doing a little drawing myself. Lots of suggestions. I&#x27;ve seen a few of the episodes, and it&#x27;s neat to see a lot of the stuff I&#x27;ve worked on.&quot; While final preparations were underway, he relaunched the official comics canon of the franchise with &quot;Volume Four&quot; (the third published by Mirage Studios), with artwork supplied by fellow TMNT writer, friend, and Rat King creator Jim Lawson. When the new series proved a success, Laird relaunched &quot;Tales of the TMNT&quot; to accompany the fourth volume.

Following a successful deal to revive the Turtles theatrically, Laird put Volume Four on hold to develop the new film, leaving several plot lines unresolved. &quot;Tales of the TMNT&quot; was thought to go on hiatus in 2008, and the franchise&#x27;s future beyond its on-screen presence was uncertain, but staff confirmed that this was not the case. It was confirmed on Steve Murphy&#x27;s blog that Peter Laird was intending to return to Volume 4 and that the title would return, distributed digitally by Mirage.

==Mirage Studios==

With the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Eastman and Laird hired a core group of artists to help with the increasing workload, beginning with Eastman&#x27;s high school friend Steve Lavigne, brought on in 1984 as a letterer.

In 1985, Eastman and Laird hired Cleveland artist Ryan Brown to assist them as an inker, and a year later penciler Jim Lawson and cover painter Michael Dooney joined the studio. These six individuals would allow Mirage to expand into a number of spin-off and companion titles, starting with &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, designed to fill in continuity gaps in the main title. Operating from a renovated factory space in Florence, Massachusetts, the Mirage team produced most of their work in-house, including the Playmates Toys toy designs and the Archie TMNT comic series, until Tundra Publishing took over the building.

Eastman and Laird along with Brown, Dooney, Lavigne and Lawson toured extensively over the years, making personal appearances and attending many comic book conventions. As the Turtles&#x27; popularity increased, further people were added to the studio, including Eric Talbot (who attended Eastman and Lavigne&#x27;s old high school), writer Stephen Murphy, and Brown&#x27;s friend, Dan Berger, who was brought in from Ohio to ink the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures title from Archie Comics. Aside from Eastman (whose creative differences and other pursuits saw him leave and sell his interest to Laird and Mirage), these individuals have remained with Mirage to the present. Stephen Murphy stepped down from his position as the managing editor in the middle of 2007 in favor of Dan Berger; Murphy remained as the creative director. In 1988, Mirage Studios participated in the drafting of the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights for comic book creators.

==The Xeric Foundation==

In addition to his other interests, Laird founded the Xeric Foundation, a nonprofit organization created after considerable thought, as &quot;an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world,&quot; by providing grants for self-publishers. While Eastman founded Tundra Publishing to embody the ideals of the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights from a publisher&#x27;s standpoint, Laird&#x27;s vision involved funding rather than actively publishing individuals&#x27; work. His reasoning for this decision was in part simply due to him having &quot;far too much to do as it is with Mirage.&quot; He &quot;preferred to do something where it was more of a transfer of capital,&quot; with &quot;all the worries... on &quot;other&quot; people&#x27;s shoulders.&quot; The foundation itself, he explains is: &quot;actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to self-publish their comics.&quot; That later half is perhaps what the foundation is best known for, working much the same as any benevolent fund, involving an applicatory process detailing how much money is being applied for and why.

===Origins===
Laird&#x27;s &quot;experience with the Turtles and self-publishing&quot; was a learning process that, he felt &quot;would be very valuable to other people to go through&quot; as well, &quot;in teaching creators about themselves, about life [and] about the hard reality of business.&quot; He cites the summits he, Eastman, Scott McCloud, Dave Sim and others had (which led directly to the formalizing of the &quot;Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights,&quot; setting out in writing the necessary working arrangements that comics creators felt ought to be met regarding ownership of their work and proper remuneration, etc.) in informing his decision to set up the foundation, but also notes that he received &quot;many requests for money,&quot; necessitating the creation of the Xeric Foundation&#x27;s charitable end simply to deal with such requests &quot;in an organized fashion.&quot;

Indeed, when asked in an interview on the Project Fanboy website, Laird was quoted as saying:

The initial impetus for creating the Xeric Foundation was frustration – when the Turtle thing started getting really huge, people started coming out of the woodwork to ask for money. Many of them were legitimate charitable organizations or creators needing funding, but there were also quite a few ridiculous things – like the total stranger who asked me for a quarter of a million dollars to fund his general store. It got to the point where I was getting overwhelmed with making these kinds of decisions, and it was suggested to me that a foundation might be a good way to &quot;separate the wheat from the chaff&quot;, providing official and clearly delineated channels through which people looking for money had to make their way.

Laird recalled that the publication of the first issue of his and Eastman&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin Eastman&#x27;s uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: &quot;if we hadn&#x27;t gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who &quot;knows&quot; what might have happened differently as a result of that delay?&quot; It occurred to him that &quot;there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of&quot; a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his &quot;good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out&quot; (and, in addition to the creators, the foundation also aids those &quot;involved in charitable organizations&quot;).

Moreover, he cites &quot;[a] big difference&quot; between his and Eastman&#x27;s personal &quot;Turtles&quot; situation and the charitable foundation as being &quot;that the Xeric grants are not loans, which have to be paid back, but actual grants, which do not.&quot; He &quot;credit[s] Kendall Clark, who has run the foundation for me from the beginning, as one of the main reasons it has worked as well as it has... she&#x27;s done a wonderful job.&quot;

===Naming and process===
The naming of the foundation &quot;originated out of a Scrabble game with [Laird&#x27;s] brother Don,&quot; &quot;Xeric&quot; simply being &quot;a word [he] like[d]&quot; ostensibly meaning dry and desertlike – but which ultimately &quot;has absolutely no direct connection with the foundation.&quot;

The creative side of the foundation involves the usual application process, but in addition, the foundation began with &quot;an advisory committee made up of three... people working in the industry&quot; whose input is sought on how best to proceed with each application. Submissions are evaluated prior to Laird&#x27;s involvement, and then he makes the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations. Laird stated in 1993 that: &quot;...knock on wood, God willing, and the creek don&#x27;t rise, if we go on for another couple of decades, and I&#x27;m able to put more money into the basic funding of the Xeric Foundation, then the amount of money that can be given out can really be raised significantly.&quot; He hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from &quot;thousands of dollars&quot; to &quot;hundreds of thousands of dollars,&quot; to support an increasing number of large and small projects.

==Other work==
In a 1993 interview with Stephen Bissette and Stanley Wiater, interviewer-editors of &quot;Comic Book Rebels&quot;, Laird commented:
Since that time, Laird has been able to find time to pursue some other comic book work, including publishing &quot;Stupid Heroes&quot;, and the graphic novel trilogy &quot;Planet Racers&quot;, with Jim Lawson. Even this ties into the TMNT, however, since the 2003 &quot;TMNT&quot; series has episodes based on the theme of &quot;Planet Racers&quot;.

In December 2019, issue #100 of IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comic series featured a teaser ad for an upcoming comic project titled &quot;The Last Ronin&quot; in which the prospect of a possible reunion and cooperation between Laird and Eastman was held out. The project was confirmed in April 2020, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and ultimately manifested in the fall of that year.

<doc id="1205782" wikidata="Q311883" url="?curid=1205782" title="Maranao people">
<text>The Maranao people (Maranao: &quot;Bangsa&quot; &quot;Mëranaw&quot;; Filipino: &quot;mga&quot; &quot;Maranaw&quot;), also spelled Meranaw, Maranaw, and Mëranaw, is a predominantly Muslim Filipino ethnic group native to the region around Lanao Lake in the island of Mindanao. They are known for their artwork, weaving, wood, plastic and metal crafts and epic literature, the Darangen. They are ethnically and culturally closely related to the Iranun people and Maguindanao people, all three groups being denoted speaking Danao languages and giving name to the island of Mindanao. They are grouped with other Moro people due to their shared religion.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Maranao&quot; (also spelled &quot;Mëranaw&quot;, or &quot;Maranaw&quot;) means &quot;people of the lake&quot; (&quot;lanaw&quot; or &quot;ranaw&quot;, archaic &quot;danaw&quot;, means &quot;lake&quot; in the Maranao language). This is in reference to Lake Lanao, the predominant geographic feature of the ancestral homeland of the Maranao people.

The original endonym of the ancestral Maranao is believed to be &quot;Iranaoan&quot;. This group later diverged, resulting in the modern Maguindanaon and the Iranun people (whose names can also be translated to &quot;people of the lake&quot;), while the ancestral Iranaoan who stayed in Lake Lanao became known as the Maranao. These three ethnic groups are still related to each other, share similar cultures and speak languages belonging to the Danao language family.
==Confederate States of Lanao==
The Maranao were the last of the Muslims of the Southern Philippines undergoing Islamization, primarily under the influence of the Arab-Malay missionaries like Sharif Kabungsuan and other from Borneo.

Like neighboring Moros and the Lumads, during the nominal occupation of the Philippines by the Spanish, and later the American and the Japanese, the Maranao had tribal leaders called &quot;datu&quot;. In the 16th century, upon the arrival of Islam, they developed into kingdoms with sultans due to the influence of Muslim missionaries.

==Culture==
Maranao culture can be characterized by:

*Lake Lanao
*Sarimanok (&quot;Papanoka a Məra&quot; or &quot;Marapatik&quot;)
*Torogan, Maranao royal houses, where the architecture used is the most aesthetic in the Philippines
*Darangən, an epic UNESCO Intangible cultural heritage
*Kirim, pre-Hispanic handwriting based from Arabic letters with 19 consonants and 7 vowels
*Singkil, a Philippine dance based on a scene from the &quot;Darangən&quot;
*Okir wood and metal carvings
*Kapmorod and Kakhalilang with Sambolayang and Pasandalan a Morog and Marigay for Kazipa sa Manggis
*Kaplagod (racing horses)
*Tabo, a drum used in mosques to call worshippers to prayer

Maranao culture is centered around Lake Lanao, the largest lake in Mindanao, and second-largest and deepest lake in the Philippines. Lanao is the subject of various myths and legends. It supports a major fishery, and powers the hydroelectric plant installed on it; the Agus River system generates 70% of the electricity used by the people of Mindanao. A commanding view of the lake is offered by Marawi City, the provincial capital.

===Visual arts===

Sarimanok, Papanok a &quot;Məra&quot; or &quot;Marapatik&quot; is a legendary bird of the Maranao that is a ubiquitous symbol of their art. It is depicted as a Hoodhud Arabic with colorful wings and feathered tail, holding a fish on its beak or talons. The head of Sarimanok is like the head of a Hoopoe (Balalatoc in maranaw) and is profusely decorated with scroll, leaf and spiral motifs (&quot;okir&quot;). It is a symbol of good fortune.

The Maranao have also developed their own adaptation of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; epic, the &quot;Maharadia Lawana&quot;. They also have a traditional dance, the Singkil, which was based on another local Ramayana adaptation, the &quot;Darangən&quot;.

==== Architecture ====
Traditional Maranao architecture, like elsewhere in the Philippines and at large maritime Southeast Asia, follows the Austronesian framework of wooden structures on piles, divided in three tiers pertaining to social class: &quot;torogan&quot; of royalty, &quot;mala a walay&quot; of lesser nobility, and the common &quot;lawig&quot; analogous to the &quot;bahay kubo&quot;.

===Music and performing arts===
Maranao kulintang music is a type of a gong music. Sarunaay is also found among both Muslim and non-Muslim groups of the Southern Philippines. Kobbing is a Maranao instrument and Biyula is another popular Instrument. Biyula is a string instrument. In 2005, the Darangen Epic of the Maranao people of Lake Lanao was selected by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

===Cuisine===
Maranao cuisine is spicier compared to most regions elsewhere in the Philippines, a trait largely shared with much of Mindanao. Traditionally cultivated spices, locally known as &quot;palapa&quot; Bontang, native product of Gandamatu are a common condiment. It is made of stewed &quot;sakurab&quot; scallion bulbs, ginger, and chillies in coconut oil.

Dishes are intertwined with important cultural rituals across all aspects of Maranao culture: from birth to death.

=== Social structure ===
Traditionally, Maranao society is divided into two strata. Namely, &quot;mapiyatao&quot; (pure) and &quot;kasilidan&quot; (mixed blood). &quot;kasilidan&quot; is further subdivided into categories which are as follows; &quot;sarowang&quot; (non-Maranao), &quot;balbal&quot; (beast), &quot;dagamot&quot; (Sorcerer/Sorceress) and &quot;bisaya&quot; (Slave). The &quot;mapiyatao&quot; are natives entitled to ascend to thrones by pure royal bloodline. On the other hand, the &quot;kasilidan&quot; are natives suspected of mixed bloodline. However, due to the changes brought by time, these social strata are beginning to decline due to the rise of wealth of each and every Maranao families.

==Demographics==

Maranaos number 1,800,000 in 2020, representing 1.65% of the population. Along with the Iranun and Maguindanao, the Maranao are one of three, related, indigenous groups native to Mindanao. These groups share genes, linguistic and cultural ties to non-Muslim Lumad groups such as the Tiruray or Subanon. Maranao royals have varied infusions of Arab, Indian, Malay, and Chinese ancestry

== Language ==

Maranao is an Austronesian language spoken by the Maranao people in the provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. Because of the mass influx of Cebuano migrants to Mindanao, many Maranaos are also fluent in Cebuano. Tagalog is also spoken by the Maranaos, which ranks second among its native language, along with English, and Arabic due to its importance to Islam and Maranao culture.

<text>The 10th Infantry Division was created in October 1934 under the cover name &quot;Wehrgauleitung Regensburg&quot; (later &quot;Kommandant von Regensburg&quot;) to hide its violation of the Treaty of Versailles. It was renamed the 10th Infantry Division when the establishment of the Wehrmacht was announced publicly in October 1935.

The division participated in the annexation of Austria in March 1938, the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and the invasion of France in May 1940. Thereafter it was upgraded to the 10th Motorized Infantry Division. It was later redesignated 10th Panzergrenadier Division in June 1943.

In August 1944 the division was destroyed in the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive and ensuing defensive actions. It was partially reconstituted in Germany in October, and sent back to the front as an understrength &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; (&quot;battlegroup&quot;).

On 1 January 1945, the 10th Panzergrenadier Division, then under command of the 4th Panzer Army of Army Group A, had a strength of 5,932 men (and was thus the numerically weakest division of its entire army group).

It was destroyed again in Poland in January 1945 and again partially reconstituted in February. The division finally surrendered to the Soviets in Czechoslovakia at the end of the war.

==Involvement in war crimes==
Elements of the division took part in atrocities against the civilian population during the invasion of Poland. Together with elements of the 17th Infantry Division, they took part in the murder of at least 14 civilians during the division&#x27;s advance towards Sieradz and Łask.

<text>Immiserizing growth is a theoretical situation first proposed by Jagdish Bhagwati, in 1958, where economic growth could result in a country being worse off than before the growth. If growth is heavily export based, it might lead to a fall in the terms of trade of the exporting country. In rare circumstances, this fall in the terms of trade may be so large as to outweigh the gains from growth. If so, this situation would cause a country to be worse off after growth than before. This result is only valid if the growing country is able to influence world prices. Harry G. Johnson had, independently, worked out conditions for this result in 1955.

<doc id="1205786" wikidata="Q2292080" url="?curid=1205786" title="The Stratton Story">
<text>The Stratton Story is a 1949 American biographical film directed by Sam Wood that tells the true story of Monty Stratton, a Major League Baseball pitcher who pitched for the Chicago White Sox from 1934 to 1938. The film is the first of three to pair stars Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, followed by &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; and &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot;. Stratton commented that Stewart &quot;did a great job of playing me, in a picture which I figure was about as true to life as they could make it.&quot;

&quot;The Stratton Story&quot; was a financial success and won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture Story.

==Plot==
Texas farm boy Monty Stratton demonstrates a knack for pitching a baseball. With the help of Barney Wile, a retired catcher who is now a scout, he manages to arrange a tryout with the Chicago White Sox during the team&#x27;s spring training in California. He shows promise and is given a contract.

On his first evening at spring training, Stratton is introduced to a young woman named Ethel. They start dating and fall in love, but Stratton must leave Ethel to travel to Chicago. When he is sent down to a minor league team, he proposes marriage. He is called back up to the White Sox and returns to Chicago with his newlywed bride, and by the end of the season, they are expecting a child.

The next season, Stratton is pitching during a road game and cannot focus because he is thinking of his wife giving birth in Chicago. When he is notified that he has a son, he throws a wild pitch and is pulled from the game smiling.

As his career progresses, Stratton improves so much that he is voted an All-Star in the American League. In the offseason of 1938, he accidentally shoots himself in the right leg while hunting on his farm in Texas. When his leg must be amputated, it appears as though his pitching career is over and he enters a very dark, brooding period. Nevertheless, with the support of his wife and a wooden leg, Stratton learns to walk along with his baby boy. He works hard and starts practicing his pitching again. He makes an inspirational, successful minor-league comeback in 1946.

==Cast==
* James Stewart as Monty Stratton
* June Allyson as Ethel
* Frank Morgan as Barney Wile
* Agnes Moorehead as Ma Stratton
* Bill Williams as Eddie Dibson
* Bruce Cowling as Ted Lyons
* Cliff Clark as Josh Higgins
* Mary Lawrence as Dot
* Dean White as Luke Appling
* Robert Gist as Earnie
* Gene Bearden as Himself
* Bill Dickey as Himself
* Jimmy Dykes as Himself
* Mervyn &quot;Merv&quot; Shea as Himself

Agnes Moorehead, who played the role of Monty Stratton&#x27;s mother, was only seven years James Stewart&#x27;s senior.

Warner Bros. contract player Ronald Reagan sought the title role, but the studio refused to lend him to MGM because it believed that the film would be a failure.

Van Johnson was announced at one stage to play the lead.

==Historical inaccuracy==
The movie indicates that Stratton&#x27;s debut for the Chicago White Sox was part of a catastrophic 16–0 loss to the New York Yankees. However, Stratton&#x27;s MLB debut occurred on Saturday, June 2, 1934, in a White Sox home game at Comiskey Park versus the Detroit Tigers. Detroit already held a 10–0 lead and had two runners on base when Stratton entered the game in relief with two outs in the sixth inning. Stratton retired the Tigers in that inning without any further runs scored. During the game&#x27;s three final innings, Stratton allowed two more runs (both earned) on four hits as the Tigers won 12–0. It was Stratton&#x27;s only major-league appearance of the 1934 season.

==Production==
Scenes were staged at various baseball parks, including:
* Brookside Park in Pasadena, a spring training site for the White Sox
* Comiskey Park in Chicago, the home field of Stratton&#x27;s team, the White Sox
* Gilmore Field, the home of the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, used in the final scenes of the film that were set in Texas
* Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)
Stock footage was used to depict several other American League baseball parks in establishing shots.

==Reception==
According to MGM records, the film earned $3,831,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $657,000 overseas, resulting in a profit of $1,211,000. It was one of the most popular films of the year.

==Radio adaptation==
The story was adapted for a one-hour CBS &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; episode broadcast on February 13, 1950, that was entitled &quot;The Stratton Story.&quot; Stewart and Allyson repeated their roles for the program.

<text>Dennis Worden is an American comic book writer and artist best known as the creator of the comic book &quot;Stickboy&quot;. 

Worden&#x27;s alternative comics caught the public&#x27;s attention in the early 1980s, via Robert Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Weirdo&quot; comics anthology, for which he was a frequent contributor throughout the magazine&#x27;s run. During that same period, Worden was a regular contributor to the comics anthology &quot;Rip Off Comix&quot;. Worden has the distinction of being the only male cartoonist to ever contribute to the all-female underground comix anthology &quot;Tits &amp; Clits Comix&quot;.

He created the comic book &quot;Stickboy&quot;, detailing the existential adventures of a stick figure. There were eight issues, published, successively by Fantagraphics (issues #1–3, 1988–1990), Revolutionary Comics (issues #4–5, 1990–1992), Starhead Comix (issues #6–7, 1993–1995), and Carnal Comics (issue #8, 2005). 

Other comic books by Worden include &quot;Slur&quot; (self-published, 1982), &quot;Bongo Dick&quot; (self-published, 1986), &quot;Suburban Teens On Acid&quot; (self-published, 1986), &quot;Pedestrian Vulgarity&quot; (Fantagraphics, 1990), and &quot;Acidboy&quot; (Starhead Comix, 1996). He also did the character The Floating Skull, who appears in &quot;Heavy Metal Monsters&quot; (Revolutionary Comics, 1992), one story of which the Floating Skull appears on the David Letterman show.

In 1993, Worden shot a &quot;Stickboy&quot; music video with two songs by the English punk bank Rancid Hell Spawn.

Worden appears in 2005 documentary film &quot;Unauthorized and Proud Of It&quot; — a.k.a. &quot;The Story of Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Comics&quot; — alongside Alice Cooper, Mojo Nixon, Gene Simmons, painter Robert Williams, publishers Denis Kitchen and Gary Groth, cartoonists Mary Fleener, Cynthia Plaster Caster, and others. The film, featuring a soundtrack by Elvis Costello (among others), was released on DVD in 2012.

<text>Kechries (, rarely Κεχρεές) is a village in the municipality of Corinth in Corinthia in Greece, part of the community of Xylokeriza. Population 319 (2021). It takes its name from the ancient port town Kenchreai or Cenchreae (), which was situated at the same location.

==Geography==
Kechries is situated near a broad bay at the western end of the Saronic Gulf, called Kechries Bay. This coastline forms the easternmost point of the Corinth Fault. The area has frequently felt the impact of seismic activity, which has led to the moderate subsidence of the coastline since ancient times. Kechries is a small village with a school and a church. The number of permanent residents of Kechries is small, and many houses there are used seasonally by owners who reside elsewhere. The Oneia Mountains lie to the south, where a major stone quarry is located, and the village is surrounded by fertile land dedicated to the cultivation of olive, the vine, and fruit trees.

Kechries is located about southeast of modern Corinth and southwest of Isthmia, at the eastern end of the Corinth Canal. Other nearby villages are Loutra Elenis (2 km south), Xylokeriza (4 km west) and Kyras Vrysi (3 km north).

==History==

In ancient times, Kenchreai was one of the two ports of the inland city-state of Corinth. While Kenchreai served the eastern trade routes via the Saronic Gulf, Lechaion on the Corinthian Gulf served the trade routes leading west to Italy and the rest of Europe. Situated on the eastern side of the Isthmus of Corinth, Kenchreai sat at a natural crossroads for ships arriving from the east and overland traffic heading north and south between central Greece and the Peloponnese.

===Beginnings===
The origin of Kenchreai is unknown, but it must have been inhabited from early times, probably in prehistory, on account of the deep natural harbor that was favorable for landing ships. The area is endowed with abundant water sources, a massive bedrock of oolitic limestone that is excellent building stone, and several defensible positions with good viewpoints. The name of the site seems to derive from the ancient Greek word for millet, and the area&#x27;s capacity for agricultural production is still evident.

===Late Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods===
The earliest textual sources for Kenchreai, an epitaph of the Late Archaic period (late 6th-early 5th century BC) and references in historical and geographical writings of the Classical to Hellenistic eras (5th-2nd centuries BCE), reveal that there was a permanent settlement and a fortified naval station. Few archaeological remains survive from this early settlement, but it seems to have been located westward from the modern coast, along the prominent ridge that borders the modern village to the north.

===Roman period===
Kenchreai flourished during the Roman Empire, when the settlement was focused around the crescent-shaped harbour enclosed by massive concrete breakwaters and protected by sea-walls. The local community was small but prosperous, and it was distinguished by its social, cultural, and religious diversity. Ancient literature and inscriptions from the site attest to the presence of cults of Aphrodite, Isis, Asklepios, Poseidon, Dionysos, and Pan.

====Early Christian presence====
Christianity also arrived at Kenchreai early in the religion&#x27;s history. According to , the Apostle Paul stopped at Kenchreai during his second missionary journey, where he had his hair cut to fulfil a vow, probably a Nazirite vow. Paul mentions the place and a woman named Phoebe in the local assembly in his epistle to the Romans ().

===Byzantine period===
Archaeological evidence indicates that trade with other Mediterranean regions continued into the 7th Century CE.

A later ecclesiastical tradition recorded the existence of a bishop at Kenchreai, but the veracity of these accounts is hard to establish.

===Medieval period===
Historical and geographical texts of the Byzantine and post-Byzantine eras indicate that Kenchreai was still used by travellers and Imperial expeditions. While the ancient harbour could still receive ship traffic after antiquity, the archaeological evidence for medieval occupation is thin, and any permanent settlement must have been smaller than in ancient times.

===Modern period===
A small harbor facility operated during early modern times, mostly serving to export local produce, including grains, citrus fruit, and tomatoes.

==Archaeological work==
The ancient harbor was partly excavated in 1962-1969 by a team sponsored by the Athens-based American School of Classical Studies under the general direction of Robert Scranton. Excavations have uncovered several buildings that attest to the commercial vitality of the port throughout the Roman Empire and into the 7th century, when maritime activity and local habitation apparently diminished. The most impressive buildings located at the north and south ends of the harbor include blocks of rooms near the waterfront (probably warehouses); fishtanks; monumental complexes decorated with sculpted marble (possibly sanctuaries of Aphrodite and of Isis whose cults the 2nd-century CE writer Pausanias attests at the town), mosaic pavements, and wall-painting (either sacred structures, lavish seaside villas, or rich public benefactions); and a Christian basilica. Most distinctive among the many discoveries was over a hundred fourth-century CE panels in glass &quot;opus sectile&quot; found in their original packing crates and awaiting installation in a possible sanctuary of Isis whose great annual festival is the scene of the climax of Apuleius&#x27; novel &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; which tells the story of a man turned into a donkey and back again (thanks to the intervention of the goddess). The Chicago team published six volumes about the architecture, glass panels, pottery, coins, lamps and furniture pieces from the excavations. Material from the excavations is stored in the Archaeological Museum of Isthmia, where some of it is on display. The American Excavations at Kenchreai are now directed by Joseph L. Rife, whose team has begun to re-evaluate the discoveries in the 1960s and to complete their study and publication.

Since 2002, survey and excavation jointly sponsored by the American School of Classical Studies and the Greek Ministry of Culture has explored the area immediately north of the harbour on the low coastal ridge called Koutsongila. These investigations concentrated on a vast cemetery of Early Roman chamber tombs and Roman to Early Byzantine cist graves, an opulent residential quarter facing seaward, and other large structures overlooking the harbour. The bountiful artifacts and structures found both at the harbour and on Koutsongila reveal the considerable wealth of local residents, including several objects of exceptional artistic quality, and a connection to points of production and exchange to the east in the Aegean islands, Asia Minor, and the Near East.

<doc id="1205820" wikidata="Q938749" url="?curid=1205820" title="Koshi Inaba">
<text>is a Japanese singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known as the vocalist and lyricist of the rock duo B&#x27;z, the best-selling music act in their native Japan. He also has a successful solo career, with six studio albums and five singles topping the Japanese music charts. Inaba collaborated with Slash on the latter&#x27;s 2009 single &quot;Sahara&quot;, and with Stevie Salas on the albums &quot;Chubby Groove&quot; (2017) and &quot;Maximum Huavo&quot; (2020).

== Early life ==

Koshi Inaba was born and raised in Tsuyama, Okayama, and enrolled in Yokohama National University&#x27;s Faculty for Education in 1983 to become a qualified mathematics teacher. Inaba made his musical debut in 1985 whilst still a student, contributing vocals to Toshiya &quot;Ran&quot; Matsukawa&#x27;s album &quot;Burning ~Dedication to Randy Rhoads~&quot; under the stage name Mr. Crazy Tiger. He graduated in 1987 when he also formed a short-lived band.

== B&#x27;z and solo career ==
Beginning with &quot;B&#x27;z&quot; in 1988, Inaba has, together with guitarist Tak Matsumoto, continued to release new material and tour as part of B&#x27;z almost every year since. He has also periodically released solo material, starting in 1997 with the album &quot;Magma&quot;, produced whilst B&#x27;z were on a brief hiatus. It was one of the albums to receive the &quot;Best Rock Album of the Year&quot; award at the 12th Japan Gold Disc Awards. Unlike in B&#x27;z, where he contributes only lyrics, Inaba has composed the music for his solo releases. All his studio albums and singles until now have topped the Oricon music charts. Additionally, the first studio album with 1,001,160 sold copies was the 21st best-selling album of the year, second &quot;Shian&quot; with 438,930 copies was the 39th in 2002, third &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; with 297,103 copies was 48th in 2004, fourth &quot;Hadou&quot; with 177,984 was 38th in 2010, and &quot;Singing Bird&quot; with 107,551 was certified Gold by RIAJ. As for singles, &quot;Tooku Made&quot; with 663,660 sold copies was the 28th best-selling single of the year 1999, &quot;Ki&quot; with 275,957 copies was 25th in 2003, &quot;Wonderland&quot; with 225,229 copies was 36th in 2004, &quot;Okay&quot; with 134,381 copies was 45th in 2010, and &quot;Hane&quot; was certified Gold and was 51st in 2016. His live video recordings also topped the charts, hence cumulatively, according to reported yearly sales and certifications he sold over 3.4 million records.

Inaba has also sung on other artists&#x27; releases, such as the Steve Vai song &quot;Asian Sky&quot; from the album &quot;The Ultra Zone&quot; in 1999. On September 29, 2009, it was announced that Inaba would be featured in Slash&#x27;s 2010 solo album, &quot;Slash&quot;. Inaba sang on the first single, &quot;Sahara&quot;, released on November 11, 2009, in Japan. The song, for which Inaba wrote the lyrics, was featured as the 15th track of the Japanese edition of the album. The single charted at #4 on the Oricon weekly singles chart. On February 24, 2010, it was announced that single &quot;Sahara&quot; won the Western &quot;Single of the Year&quot; award at Japan Gold Disc Award held by RIAJ. In 2017, Inaba released a collaborative album with Stevie Salas under the name &quot;Inaba/Salas&quot;. The album, &quot;Chubby Groove&quot;, went to #2 in the Japanese album charts and was certified Gold by RIAJ.
Hiroshi Inaba takes care of his physical condition by not drinking alcohol and not using the air conditioning much during the tour to protect his throat.
Marty Friedman once listed Hiroshi Inaba as the best vocalist in the whole world. The reason for this, he says, is that his voice hasn&#x27;t faded after more than 20 years of singing hard rock songs. He performed the Japanese dubbing voice for Clay Calloway in &quot;Sing 2&quot;.

<doc id="1205821" wikidata="Q4062508" url="?curid=1205821" title="Alcoholic polyneuropathy">
<text>Alcoholic polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder in which peripheral nerves throughout the body malfunction simultaneously. It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body. This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally. Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism; however, vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development. This disease typically occurs in chronic alcoholics who have some sort of nutritional deficiency. Treatment may involve nutritional supplementation, pain management, and abstaining from alcohol.

==Signs and symptoms==

An early warning sign (prodrome) of the possibility of developing alcoholic polyneuropathy, especially in a chronic alcoholic, would be weight loss because this usually signifies a nutritional deficiency that can lead to the development of the disease.

Alcoholic polyneuropathy usually has a gradual onset over months or even years, although axonal degeneration often begins before an individual experiences any symptoms.

The disease typically involves sensory issues and motor loss, as well as painful physical perceptions, though all sensory modalities may be involved.
Symptoms that affect the sensory and motor systems seem to develop symmetrically. For example, if the right foot is affected, the left foot is affected simultaneously or soon becomes affected.
In most cases, the legs are affected first, followed by the arms. The hands usually become involved when the symptoms reach above the ankle. This is called a stocking-and-glove pattern of sensory disturbances.

===Sensory===
Common manifestations of sensory issues include numbness or painful sensations in the arms and legs, abnormal sensations like &quot;pins and needles,&quot; and heat intolerance. Pain experienced by individuals depends on the severity of the polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others. In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the palpitation of muscles in the feet and legs. Certain people may also feel cramping sensations in the muscles affected and others say there is a burning sensation in their feet and calves.

===Motor===
Sensory symptoms are gradually followed by motor symptoms. Motor symptoms may include muscle cramps and weakness, erectile dysfunction in men, problems urinating, constipation, and diarrhea. Individuals also may experience muscle wasting and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes. Some people may experience frequent falls and gait unsteadiness due to ataxia. This ataxia may be caused by cerebellar degeneration, sensory ataxia, or distal muscle weakness. Over time, alcoholic polyneuropathy may also cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), speech impairment (disarthria), muscle spasms, and muscle atrophy.

In addition to alcoholic polyneuropathy, the individual may also show other related disorders such as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome and cerebellar degeneration that result from alcoholism-related nutritional disorders.

===Severity===
Polyneuropathy spans a large range of severity. Some cases are seemingly asymptomatic and may only be recognized on careful examination. The most severe cases may cause profound physical disability.

==Causes==
The general cause of this disease appears to be prolonged and heavy consumption of alcohol accompanied by a nutritional deficiency. However, there is ongoing debate over the active mechanisms, including whether the main cause is the direct toxic effect of alcohol itself or whether the disease is a result of alcoholism-related malnutrition. A 2019 metastudy found that the relationship between ethanol toxicity and neuropathy remained unproven.

===Effects due to nutritional deficiency===
Frequently alcoholics have disrupted social links in their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic gastritis, and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system and reduces absorption of nutrients that are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.

There is evidence that providing individuals with adequate vitamins improves symptoms despite continued alcohol intake, indicating that vitamin deficiency may be a major factor in the development and progression of alcoholic polyneuropathy. In experimental models of alcoholic polyneuropathy utilizing rats and monkeys no convincing evidence was found that proper nutritional intake along with alcohol results in polyneuropathy.

In most cases, individuals with alcoholic polyneuropathy have some degree of nutritional deficiency. Alcohol, a carbohydrate, increases the metabolic demand for thiamine (vitamin B1) because of its role in the metabolism of glucose. Thiamine levels are usually low in alcoholics due to their decreased nutritional intake. In addition, alcohol interferes with intestinal absorption of thiamine, thereby further decreasing thiamine levels in the body. Thiamine is important in three reactions in the metabolism of glucose: the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid, d-ketoglutaric acid, and transketolase. A lack of thiamine in the cells may therefore prevent neurons from maintaining necessary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels as a result of impaired glycolysis. Thiamine deficiency alone could explain the impaired nerve conduction in those with alcoholic polyneuropathy, but other factors likely play a part.

The malnutrition many alcoholics experience deprives them of important cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and disruption of the cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases current leakage, and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this is also known as retrograde degeneration.

Many of the studies conducted that observe alcoholic polyneuropathy in patients are often criticized for their criteria used to assess nutritional deficiency in the subjects because they may not have completely ruled out the possibility of a nutritional deficiency in the genesis of the polyneuropathy. Many researchers favor the nutritional origin of this disease, but the possibility of alcohol having a toxic effect on the peripheral nerves has not been completely ruled out.

===Effects due to alcohol ingestion===
The consumption of alcohol may lead to the buildup of certain toxins in the body. For example, in the process of breaking down alcohol, the body produces acetaldehyde, which can accumulate to toxic levels in alcoholics. This suggests that there is a possibility ethanol (or its metabolites) may cause alcoholic polyneuropathy. There is evidence that polyneuropathy is also prevalent in well nourished alcoholics, supporting the idea that there is a direct toxic effect of alcohol.

The metabolic effects of liver damage associated with alcoholism may also contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Normal products of the liver, such as lipoic acid, may be deficient in alcoholics. This deficiency would also disrupt glycolysis and alter metabolism, transport, storage, and activation of essential nutrients.

Acetaldehyde is toxic to peripheral nerves. There are increased levels of acetaldehyde produced during ethanol metabolism. If the acetaldehyde is not metabolized quickly the nerves may be affected by the accumulation of acetaldehyde to toxic levels.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of alcoholic polyneuropathy is unclear.

==Diagnosis==
Alcoholic polyneuropathy is very similar to other axonal degenerative polyneuropathies and therefore can be difficult to diagnose. When alcoholics have sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a nutritional deficiency, a diagnosis of alcoholic polyneuropathy is often reached.

To confirm the diagnosis, a physician must rule out other causes of similar clinical syndromes. Other neuropathies can be differentiated on the basis of typical clinical or laboratory features. Differential diagnoses to alcoholic polyneuropathy include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, beriberi, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy, Guillain Barre Syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex and post-polio syndrome.

To clarify the diagnosis, medical workup most commonly involves laboratory tests, though, in some cases, imaging, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and vibrometer testing may also be used.

A number of tests may be used to rule out other causes of peripheral neuropathy. One of the first presenting symptoms of diabetes mellitus may be peripheral neuropathy, and hemoglobin A1C can be used to estimate average blood glucose levels. Elevated blood creatinine levels may indicate chronic kidney disease and may also be a cause of peripheral neuropathy. A heavy metal toxicity screen should also be used to exclude lead toxicity as a cause of neuropathy.

Alcoholism is normally associated with nutritional deficiencies, which may contribute to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Thiamine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid are vitamins that play an essential role in the peripheral and central nervous system and should be among the first analyzed in laboratory tests. It has been difficult to assess thiamine status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly assay thiamine in the blood and urine. A liver function test may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.

==Management==
Although there is no known cure for alcoholic polyneuropathy, there are a number of treatments that can control symptoms and promote independence. Physical therapy is beneficial for strength training of weakened muscles, as well as for gait and balance training.

===Nutrition===

To best manage symptoms, refraining from consuming alcohol is essential. Abstinence from alcohol encourages proper diet and helps prevent progression or recurrence of the neuropathy. Once an individual stops consuming alcohol it is important to make sure they understand that substantial recovery usually isn&#x27;t seen for a few months. Some subjective improvement may appear right away, but this is usually due to the overall benefits of alcohol detoxification. If alcohol consumption continues, vitamin supplementation alone is not enough to improve the symptoms of most individuals.

Nutritional therapy with parenteral multivitamins is beneficial to implement until the person can maintain adequate nutritional intake. Treatments also include vitamin supplementation (especially thiamine). In more severe cases of nutritional deficiency 320 mg/day of benfotiamine for 4 weeks followed by 120 mg/day for 4 more weeks may be prescribed in an effort to return thiamine levels to normal.

===Pain===
Painful dysesthesias caused by alcoholic polyneuropathy can be treated by using gabapentin or amitriptyline in combination with over-the-counter pain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, or carbamazepine may help stabbing pains and have central and peripheral anticholinergic and sedative effects. These agents have central effects on pain transmission and block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

Anticonvulsant drugs like gabapentin or pregabalin block the active reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and have properties that relieve neuropathic pain. However, these medications take a few weeks to become effective and are rarely used in the treatment of acute pain.

Topical analgesics like capsaicin may also relieve minor aches and pains of muscles and joints.

==Prognosis==
Alcoholic polyneuropathy is not life-threatening but may significantly affect one&#x27;s quality of life. Effects of the disease range from mild discomfort to severe disability.

It is difficult to assess the prognosis of a patient because alcohol dependence results in difficulty maintaining abstinence from drinking alcohol. It has been shown that a good prognosis may be given for mild neuropathy if the person has abstained from drinking for 3–5 years.

===Early stage===
During the early stages of the disease the damage appears reversible when people take adequate amounts of vitamins, such as thiamine. If the polyneuropathy is mild, the individual normally experiences a significant improvement and symptoms may be eliminated within weeks to months after proper nutrition is established. When those people diagnosed with alcohol polyneuropathy experience a recovery, it is presumed to result from regeneration and collateral sprouting of the damaged axons.

===Progressed disease===
As the disease progresses, the damage may become permanent. In severe cases of thiamine deficiency, a few of the positive symptoms (including neuropathic pain) may persist indefinitely. Even after the restoration of a balanced nutritional intake, those patients with severe or chronic polyneuropathy may experience lifelong residual symptoms.

==Epidemiology==
In 2020 the NIH quoted an estimate that in the United States 25% to 66% of chronic alcohol users experience some form of neuropathy. The rate of incidence of alcoholic polyneuropathy involving sensory and motor polyneuropathy has been stated as from 10% to 50% of alcoholics depending on the subject selection and diagnostic criteria. If electrodiagnostic criteria are used, alcoholic polyneuropathy may be found in up to 90% of individuals being assessed.

The distribution and severity of the disease depends on regional dietary habits, individual drinking habits, as well as an individual&#x27;s genetics. Large studies have been conducted and show that alcoholic polyneuropathy severity and incidence correlates best with the total lifetime consumption of alcohol. Factors such as nutritional intake, age, or other medical conditions are correlate in lesser degrees. For unknown reasons, alcoholic polyneuropathy has a high incidence in women.

Certain alcoholic beverages can also contain congeners that may also be bioactive; therefore, the consumption of varying alcohol beverages may result in different health consequences. An individual&#x27;s nutritional intake also plays a role in the development of this disease. Depending on the specific dietary habits, they may have a deficiency of one or more of the following: thiamine (vitamin B1), niacin (vitamin B3), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and biotin (vitamin B7), vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin A.

===Acetaldehyde===

It is also thought there is perhaps a genetic predisposition for some alcoholics that results in increased frequency of alcoholic polyneuropathy in certain ethnic groups. During the body&#x27;s processing of alcohol, ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde mainly by alcohol dehydrogenase; acetaldehyde is then oxidized to acetate mainly by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ALDH2 is an isozyme of ALDH and ALDH2 has a polymorphism (ALDH2*2, Glu487Lys) that makes ADLH2 inactive; this allele is more prevalent among Southeast and East Asians and results in a failure to quickly metabolize acetaldehyde. The neurotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of acetaldehyde may play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic polyneuropathy.

==History==

The first description of symptoms associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson has also been credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was a direct result of the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to beriberi. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two.

==Research directions==
In 2001 research directions included the effect that an alcoholics&#x27; consumption and choice of alcoholic beverage might have on their development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some beverages may include more nutrients than others (such as thiamine), but the effects of this with regards to helping with a nutritional deficiency in alcoholics is yet unknown.

Research also continued on reasons for the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some argue it is a direct result of alcohol&#x27;s toxic effect on the nerves, but others say factors such as a nutritional deficiency or chronic liver disease may play a role in the development as well. Multiple mechanisms may be present.

<text>Off-model is a term used in the animation and visual arts industries to describe art that does not match the style, design, or proportions that have been previously established for a given project (i.e. any work that is not on-model). Any kind of visual art can be off-model, so long as it defies the conventions of an established design. Consequently, art can be made off-model accidentally, due to skill or time constraints that may limit an artist&#x27;s ability to accurately replicate a style. However, off-model can also be an intentional choice on the part of an animator. John Kricfalusi has argued that off-model animation allows originality and can help a scene come to life, as strictly sticking to poses and expressions as dictated in model sheets can be too restricting.

Off-model art is often associated with 2D animation, such as cartoons and anime. For much of the history of 2D animation, individual frames have been hand-drawn in sequence. This task may be outsourced to multiple individuals or studios, increasing the chances for the miscommunication of character, environment, or item design. Animation studios attempt to limit this issue by distributing model sheets amongst animators, which may include poses or expressions for artist reference.

Off-model work may also be the product of artists or cartoonists intending to parody another franchise but not wishing to incur a lawsuit or commit copyright infringement by drawing someone else&#x27;s trademarked characters.

<text>Monty Franklin Pierce Stratton (May 21, 1912 – September 29, 1982) was an American professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was born in Palacios, Texas (some sources state Wagner, Texas) and lived in Greenville, Texas, for part of his life. His major league career ended prematurely when a hunting accident in 1938 forced doctors to amputate his right leg. Wearing a prosthetic leg, Stratton played in the minor leagues from 1946 to 1953. His comeback was the subject of the 1949 film &quot;The Stratton Story&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Jimmy Stewart.

==Major league career==
Stratton began his career with the Van Alstyne Grays before playing for the Chicago White Sox. Stratton pitched five years with the White Sox (1934–38), compiling a career 36–23 record with 196 strikeouts and a 3.71 earned run average (ERA) in innings pitched. As a hitter, Stratton was better than average for a pitcher, posting a .224 batting average (43-for-192) with 33 runs, four home runs and 24 runs batted in in 71 games. Defensively, he recorded a .975 fielding percentage.

A 6-foot-5-inch right-hander, Stratton made his debut with the White Sox on June 2, 1934. He became a starter in 1937, winning 15 games with a 2.40 ERA and five shutouts, and made the American League All-Star squad. The following season, he again won 15 and completed 17 of his 22 starts.

==Post-accident==
On November 27, 1938, Stratton was hunting rabbits on his family farm when he fell, accidentally discharging his shotgun. The pellets struck his right leg, damaging a main artery enough to require amputation the next day. Fitted with a wooden leg, Stratton worked with the White Sox the next two years as a coach and batting practice pitcher. In 1939, White Sox management sponsored a charity game in Comiskey Park against the Chicago Cubs, the proceeds of which (about $28,000 equal to $ today) went to Stratton. He took the mound to demonstrate that he could still pitch, though he was unable to transfer his weight effectively to the artificial leg.

When World War II began, Stratton attempted to enlist but was rejected. Then he organized a semi-professional baseball team at Greenville, Texas and constantly practiced coordination on the field. He spent much time experimenting and learning how to pitch despite the prosthetic leg, primarily pitching to his wife, Ethel (Milberger) Stratton, and against the side of a barn.

In 1946, Stratton pitched for the Sherman Twins of the East Texas League (Class C) and compiled a record of 18–8, with a 4.17 earned run average (ERA). In 1947, with the Waco Dons of the Big State League (Class B), he went 7–7 with a 6.55 ERA. A major challenge was moving nimbly enough on his prosthetic leg to field the bunts that were commonly sent his way by opponents. After 1947, Stratton never appeared in more than four games in a season, though he joined multiple minor-league teams ranging from Class B to Class D in 1949, 1950, and 1953.

==Legacy and life after baseball==
Stratton&#x27;s comeback attempt was the subject of a 1949 film and &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; episode as &quot;The Stratton Story&quot;, both of which starred Jimmy Stewart and June Allyson, with big-leaguers Gene Bearden, Bill Dickey, Merv Shea, and Jimmy Dykes in cameo appearances. Stratton had spent most of one year in Hollywood serving as an adviser for the movie. The film was a financial success and earned an Academy Award for best original story.

The Strattons, who lived for many years on a 93-acre farm in the Ardis Heights area of Greenville, were members of Wesley Methodist Church and were also active in the Greenville community. Monty Stratton helped start the Greenville Little League Baseball program and was recognized for his efforts by the naming of Monty Stratton Field near Greenville High School.

Stratton&#x27;s son Dennis died by suicide in 1964, aged 23 years.

Stratton died in Greenville, Texas, on September 29, 1982, at the age of 70 due to cancer. He was survived by his wife, Ethel; a son, Monty Jr.; two brothers; a sister; and four grandchildren. Ethel, who served for many years as a volunteer at Hunt Regional Medical Center in Greenville, died in 2006 in Arlington, Texas at age 90. Monty and Ethel Stratton are buried at Memoryland Memorial Park in Greenville.

In Woody Allen&#x27;s Radio Days, there&#x27;s a parody of a short film documentary about a pitcher based on Monty.

<doc id="1205872" wikidata="Q1747150" url="?curid=1205872" title="Halo (franchise)">
<text>Halo is a military science fiction video game series and media franchise, originally developed by Bungie and currently managed and developed by Halo Studios (previously 343 Industries), part of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Studios. The series launched in November 2001 with the first-person shooter video game &quot;&quot; and its tie-in novel, &quot;&quot;. The latest major installment, &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;, was released in 2021. Spinoffs include real-time strategy and twin-stick shooter games.

Bungie began as a developer of computer games for the Macintosh platform. After the company was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, their in-progress game, which started life as a real-time strategy game, became &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, a first-person shooter exclusive to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox video game. Following the success of &quot;Halo&quot;, Bungie developed additional &quot;Halo&quot; sequels before and after regaining its independence from Microsoft in 2007. Microsoft established 343 Industries to oversee &quot;Halo&quot; going forward, producing games itself and in partnership with other studios.

&quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; was the Xbox&#x27;s flagship &quot;killer app&quot; and cemented Microsoft as a major competitor in the video game console space, and its sequels pioneered online matchmaking, social features, and video game marketing. The games have sold more than 81 million copies worldwide. With more than $6 billion in franchise sales, &quot;Halo&quot; is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time, spanning novels, graphic novels, comic books, short films, animated films, feature films, fan-made short machinima animations and other licensed products.
==Story==
Many millions of years ago, a species known as the Precursors assumed the Mantle of Responsibility – the guardianship of life in the galaxy. The Precursors chose an ancient form of humanity as their successors, over another species known as the Forerunners. In retaliation, the Forerunners attacked their former masters and drove the Precursors into extinction. Instead of fighting back, the Precursors allowed themselves to die, with some turning into dust intended to spread and later transform into themselves once again. This dust eventually became defective, infecting and contorting organisms into a new parasitic species, connected by a hivemind to the minds of the last Precursors: the Flood. The Forerunners sent the humans to Earth, reverting them to a primitive civilization based in Africa, and fought the Flood, which spread through an infestation of sentient life and overran much of the Milky Way Galaxy. Exhausting all other strategies, the Forerunners conceived the Halo Array— ring-shaped megastructures and weapons of last resort that would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy to stop the Flood. A civil war began between the Forerunners&#x27; commander, known as the Ur-Didact, who wanted to assimilate all the humans on Earth into his army as AIs, thus immune to the Flood, and his wife, the Librarian, who created the Ark, an instrument that was to shelter sentient species outside the galaxy and allow for the mass creation of Halo installations which could all be activated simultaneously. The Librarian, along with all the remaining Forerunners, trapped her husband inside a Forerunner repository of knowledge known as the Domain, and disappeared as the Array was activated, thus destroying all sentient life in the galaxy and ending the outbreak of the Flood— though some Forerunners are known to have left the Milky Way galaxy for a different, unknown galaxy.
Nearly a hundred thousand years later, in the 26th century, humanity—under the auspices of the Unified Earth Government, or UEG, and their United Nations Space Command, or UNSC— has colonized many worlds thanks to the development of faster-than-light &quot;slipstream space&quot; (i.e., hyperspace) travel. Tensions between the government and colonies desiring independence sparked violent clashes. The UNSC&#x27;s Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) created the SPARTAN-II Project to create an elite group of enhanced supersoldiers to suppress the rebellions covertly. In the year 2525, human worlds came under attack by a theocratic alliance of alien races known as the Covenant, whose leadership declared humanity heretics and an affront to their gods: the Forerunners. The Covenant began a genocidal holy war. Their superior technology and numbers proved to be decisive advantages; although effective, the Spartans were too few to turn the tide of battle in humanity&#x27;s favor. After the Covenant invaded Reach in 2552, the UNSC&#x27;s last major stronghold besides Earth, Master Chief John-117 was left as one of the few remaining Spartans.

The rediscovery of the Halo rings prompts a desperate battle against the Covenant, who believe they are instruments of transcendence, not destruction. Master Chief and his artificial intelligence Cortana are instrumental in the destruction of a Halo ring to stop the Covenant and the threat of the Flood. The assassination of one of the Covenant high prophets, turmoil within the Covenant, and the revelation of the Halo Array&#x27;s true purpose leads to civil war. The disgraced former Covenant Sangheili commander known as the Arbiter, along with many of his species, helps the humans stop the Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo Array via the Ark. The Human-Covenant War ends, though new conflicts begin to emerge throughout the universe.

In the post-war era, the UNSC trains a new generation of Spartans, and tensions between the UNSC and colonist rebels resumes. The Master Chief and Cortana accidentally free the Didact and he briefly returns to assert supremacy over humanity. Master Chief and Cortana halt his plans, although Cortana is initially believed dead in the attempt. Cortana&#x27;s survival through the Domain leads her to break with the UNSC and assert a new hegemony over the galaxy, with artificial intelligence (the &quot;Created&quot;) in control. After two years of a scattered war between Cortana and the UNSC, Cortana attacks the Banished, a mercenary organization largely led by the Jiralhanae species. The Banished win the resultant conflict, terminating Cortana and battling the UNSC for control of Zeta Halo.

==Game series==

===2001–2007: Original trilogy===
Video game studio Bungie was founded in 1991 by Alex Seropian in Chicago, Illinois, who partnered with programmer Jason Jones the following year to market and release Jones&#x27; game &quot;&quot;. Focusing on the Mac game market because it was smaller and easier to compete, Bungie became a preeminent game developer on the platform, releasing the successful &quot;Myth&quot; and &quot;Marathon&quot;. Bungie began development on a new game in 1998, referring to it by the temporary code names &quot;Monkey Nuts&quot; and later &quot;Blam!&quot; after Jones could not bring himself to say the previous codename to his mother. &quot;Blam!&quot; was conceived as a science fiction real-time strategy game and took place on a hollowed-out world called Solipsis. The planet eventually became a ringworld called &quot;Halo&quot;, in turn giving the game its title.

As the development team began experimenting with incorporating vehicles with realistic physics simulations, they began moving the distant third-person camera closer to the action. Bungie decided it would be more fun to directly control units than direct them, and the game shifted to a third-person shooter. &quot;Halo&quot; was announced on July 21, 1999, during the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo. The title of the game was finalized only days before it was announced at Macworld.

Bungie was undergoing financial difficulties, and Microsoft was looking for games for its upcoming Xbox video game console. In June 2000, Microsoft announced their acquisition of Bungie, and &quot;Halo&quot;—now having morphed into a first-person shooter—became a launch title for the Xbox video game console. Relocated from Chicago to Redmond, Washington, Bungie had roughly 14 months to finish the game before the Xbox launched. The story slowly began to take shape, with an internal debate at Bungie over how much personality to give the main character. Writer Joe Staten wanted to do more than have the player character be an &quot;empty vessel&quot; like &quot;Half-Life&quot;″s Gordon Freeman, so they wrote him with a sense of humor. Deciding he should be referred to by his naval rank, Bungie decided on &quot;Master Chief&quot;. Despite a difficult and hectic development schedule, &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; shipped as a launch title for the Xbox on November 15, 2001. The Xbox&#x27;s marketing heavily featured &quot;Halo&quot;, whose green color palette meshed with the console&#x27;s design scheme. &quot;Halo&quot; was a critical and commercial success, selling alongside half of every Xbox sold. By July 2006, the game had sold 4.2 million copies and earned $170 million in the United States. 
&quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; introduced many elements common to the franchise. Players battle enemies on foot and in vehicles to complete objectives across a mysterious alien landscape. &quot;Halo&quot; limited the number of weapons players could carry to two, forcing them to carefully select their preferred armament. Players fight with ranged and melee attacks, as well as grenades. Bungie referred to the &quot;weapons-grenades-melee&quot; format as the &quot;Golden Triangle of &quot;Halo&quot;&quot;. The player&#x27;s has health measured in hit points that must be replenished with health packs, but also has a perpetually recharging energy shield.

While &quot;Halo&quot; had not been intended as a franchise, the Bungie team wanted to make an ambitious sequel, looking to story and gameplay ideas that had been ultimately cut from &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, and inspired by how fans had received the game. In particular, Bungie was surprised by how many fans used the System Link capability to network consoles together and play multiplayer in LAN parties. With the launch of the Xbox Live online multiplayer service, Bungie wanted to bring &quot;Halo&quot; multiplayer to the internet.
&quot;Halo 2&quot;, was announced on August 8, 2002, at Microsoft&#x27;s X02 press event, and an impressive demo of the game was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo the following year. The demo showed off new features like dual-wielding weapons and hijacking enemy vehicles, but behind the scenes the game was undergoing a troubled development; Bungie had to scrap the ambitious graphics engine as it would not run effectively on the Xbox hardware, leadership changes resulted in more infighting, and artists and designers wasted time developing assets that would ultimately not ship in the game. A planned massive multiplayer mode was entirely cut, leading to developer Max Hoberman&#x27;s smaller-scale local mode becoming the only multiplayer offering. As the game&#x27;s release date slipped, the studio entered a sustained period of crunch to finish the game, with other Bungie games being canceled and their staff absorbed into the &quot;Halo&quot; team. The final act of the game had to be cut entirely in the rush to complete the game. &quot;Halo 2&quot; was released on the Xbox on November 9, 2004, and later for Windows Vista on May 17, 2007. Part of the marketing took the form of an alternative reality game, &quot;I Love Bees&quot;, centered around a website apparently hacked by a mysterious intelligence. Over the course of the game, audio clips were released that formed a narrative set on Earth between &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot;. &quot;Halo 2&quot; was a critical and commercial success, grossing $125 million in the first day and becoming the highest-grossing release in entertainment history up to that point; it would ultimately sell 8 million copies, becoming the best-selling Xbox game. &quot;Halo 2&quot; was also a significant motivator for subscriptions to the Xbox Live multiplayer service.
Frustrated by the development of &quot;Halo 2&quot; and wanting to move on to new non-&quot;Halo&quot; projects, Bungie wanted to wrap things up in a satisfying manner with &quot;Halo 3&quot;. Burned out by &quot;Halo 2&quot;, Jason Jones went on an extended sabbatical, and the &quot;Halo 3&quot; effort started without direction as no one was definitively in charge. Designer Paul Bertone recalled that the large development staff (70–80 people) meant more meetings and less efficiency. Multiple staff members temporarily or permanently departed the development team, including Hoberman, who started his own studio, Certain Affinity after developing &quot;Halo 3&quot;″s online systems. Despite the difficult development, overall &quot;Halo 3&quot;″s development went more smoothly than &quot;Halo 2&quot;. &quot;Halo 3&quot; was announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and released on the Xbox 360 on September 25, 2007. It added new gameplay elements, including deployable equipment and heavy weapons. The game also added a limited map-editing tool, known as Forge, which allows players to insert game objects, such as weapons and vehicles, into existing multiplayer map geometry. A saved films feature allowed players to record gameplay and review it from any angle. Backed by an extensive marketing campaign, &quot;Halo 3&quot; was a critical and commercial success, grossing $170million in the U.S. in the first 24 hours. The game was the best-selling title of the year in the U.S., and the fourteenth best-selling game of the 2000s.

Lingering dissatisfaction with Bungie&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft in 2000 and a desire for more favorable profit-sharing on &quot;Halo 3&quot; led to an agreement where Bungie would become an independent studio after shipping a set number of new &quot;Halo&quot; games. Bungie announced their independence in October 2007. They were contractually obligated to produce two more &quot;Halo&quot; games as part of the deal. One project turned into the game &quot;&quot;, while the other was initially going to be a production with Peter Jackson&#x27;s Wingnut Interactive. When that project was scrapped, Bungie took elements prototyped for it and added them to a smaller &quot;Halo 3&quot; expansion, originally titled &quot;Halo 3: Recon&quot;.
Produced using the &quot;Halo 3&quot; engine and assets and with a smaller staff of only around 20 full-time employees, &quot;Recon&quot;—later renamed &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot;—was conceived as a noir detective story, with the player character uncovering clues in a hub world that triggered playable flashbacks. The player had flexibility to explore and play missions in any order. Bungie staffers recalled that getting resources for the game was tough, as most of the studio&#x27;s attention was on &quot;Halo: Reach&quot;. In the game, players assume the role of weaker Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs) rather than Spartan supersoldiers; lost health must be replenished with scrounged health packs. A VISR mode illuminates dark environments and highlights friends and foes, and the player is equipped with new equipment, such as silenced submachine guns and pistols. In addition to shipping with the complete &quot;Halo 3&quot; multiplayer, &quot;ODST&quot; also added a cooperative survival mode called Firefight, where players fight against waves of enemies with limited lives. &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot; released September 22, 2009, and was positively received, though its price as a full game, rather than a cheaper expansion, was occasionally criticized. It was the top-selling title of the month in the U.S. and ultimately sold more than three million copies worldwide.
Tired of focusing on the character of Master Chief, Bungie cast &quot;Halo: Reach&quot; as a prequel to &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, taking place on the doomed human world of Reach as it falls under attack from the Covenant. The step backwards in the timeline was mirrored by the gameplay, which Bungie wanted to harken to &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; with more open environments and exploration, and the return of health packs. Among the new additions were the replacement of single-use equipment with persistent armor abilities that enables sprinting, jetpacks, or temporary invincibility. The game&#x27;s release was preceded by an beta to help balance the game and squash bugs. &quot;Reach&quot; released September 14, 2010 and was a success, making $200 million its first day and selling more than 4.7 million units by September 2011.

===2010–2024: 343 Industries games===
While Bungie finished their association with &quot;Halo&quot;, the rights to the franchise remained with Microsoft. Bonnie Ross, Xbox general manager at the time, recalled that her colleagues felt &quot;Halo&quot; was a waning property and wanted to outsource new game development, while Ross argued for an internal studio. Ross&#x27; vision won out, and she was put in charge of a new internal &quot;Halo&quot; studio, 343 Industries, named after the character 343 Guilty Spark. The studio started with a small staff in late 2007.

While 343 Industries worked with Bungie on &quot;ODST&quot; and &quot;Reach&quot;, the new company&#x27;s first game project was &quot;&quot;, a remaster of the franchise&#x27;s debut title. The game was developed in partnership with Saber Interactive, with 343 Industries handling creative and Saber the engineering. Saber had just one year to develop the game in anticipation of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;″s tenth anniversary. Players can switch between the original graphics and updated visuals with a button press. Both classic and new graphics are presented in high-definition, 16:9 widescreen compared to the original game&#x27;s 480i resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio. Certain Affinity helped develop multiplayer maps for the game, beginning a long collaboration between the two studios. Reviews were generally positive, though critics disagreed if the original, unaltered gameplay held up to modern standards.

343 Industries began staffing up their studio while beginning development on the next major &quot;Halo&quot; title, eventually growing to nearly 200, and decided where they wanted to take Master Chief&#x27;s story over the course of future games. Ryan Payton was initially offered the role of creative director, but his ideas for the game did not mesh with the expected first-person shooter focus, and before prototyping was done Payon was replaced and ultimately left in 2011. Josh Holmes took over as creative designer, and the studio shifted focus from ideating to producing the game in earnest. The end result was a more safe, straightforward sequel to &quot;Halo 3&quot;. Holmes wanted the game&#x27;s story mode to explore Master Chief&#x27;s relationship with Cortana, who would break down into a dementia-like state. Struggling with making the plot accessible for new players, the team considered dropping the storyline. Holmes, drawing inspiration from his own mother&#x27;s battle with dementia, insisted it stayed in.

&quot;Halo 4&quot; was announced at E3 2011 and released November 6, 2012. The game picks up years after the events of &quot;Halo 3&quot;, as Master Chief and Cortana fight against a reawakened Forerunner. The game achieved record first-day sales for the franchise. While reviews were generally positive, the story was dinged for being incomprehensible to casual players and relying on knowledge of the wider franchise media.
Intending to create a 10th anniversary edition of &quot;Halo 2&quot;, like they had with &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, Certain Affinity and other studios collaborated on &quot;&quot;, repacking &quot;Combat Evolved Anniversary&quot;, &quot;Halo 2 Anniversary&quot;, &quot;Halo 3&quot; and &quot;Halo 4&quot; in a single collection for the Xbox One console. The launch was marred with glitches and matchmaking issues, which required numerous patches to fix. Ross apologized to fans for the state of the game, and promised future &quot;Halo&quot; games would have public betas. &quot;Reach&quot; and &quot;ODST&quot; were subsequently added to the collection, which was ported to PC and received enhancements for the Xbox Series X.
343 Industries&#x27; next installment, &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;, was announced in 2014. The game takes place across many worlds, mainly the Elite homeworld, and revolves around Spartan Locke&#x27;s hunt for the rogue Master Chief, who is trying to find a still-living Cortana.
The third part of the Reclaimer Saga, &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;, was announced during E3 2018. It brings the focus back to Master Chief, and Halo&#x27;s roots by taking place on the new Zeta Halo. The story mainly focuses on exploring the deeper lore of the &quot;Halo&quot; series, finding what happened to Cortana, and battles with the Banished. It released December 2021.

===Halo Studios and future projects===
On October 6, 2024, 343 Industries unveiled a seven-minute video where they confirmed multiple new games were currently in development using Unreal Engine 5 as opposed to the proprietary Slipspace Engine. They also rebranded as Halo Studios. Studio head Pierre Hintze explained that the decision to rebrand the studio came from an internal shift in development philosophy behind the franchise, giving the team a &quot;clean break&quot; as was the case with transitioning between Bungie and 343.

===Spin-offs===
&quot;Halo&quot; returned to its real-time strategy roots with &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, developed by Ensemble Studios for the Xbox 360 and released in 2009. The game takes place 21 years prior to the events of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;. Ensemble focused their efforts on developing a control scheme that was simple and intuitive for console strategy games, traditionally considered inferior to their keyboard-and-mouse-driven computer game siblings. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, and sold an estimated 2.6 million units, a massive success for the genre on consoles. &quot;Halo Wars&quot; was Ensemble&#x27;s last project as a studio before shuttering; post-release updates and content were developed by Robot Entertainment. A sequel, &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot;, was developed by Creative Assembly and released on Xbox One and PC platforms simultaneously in February 2017.

Interested in bringing &quot;Halo&quot; to mobile devices, 343 Industries partnered with Vanguard Games to produce &quot;&quot;, a twin-stick shooter initially released on Windows 8 tablets and phones in 2013; the game later came to the Xbox One and iOS platforms. &quot;Spartan Assault&quot; was followed by a sequel, &quot;&quot;, in 2015.

Other &quot;Halo&quot; spinoffs include a virtual reality experience, &quot;Halo Recruit&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, a coin-operated arcade game developed by Raw Thrills and PlayMechanix released in 2018, starting with Round1 USA and Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s arcades. Fireteam Raven takes place during the events of Halo: Combat Evolved and puts the players in control of up to four ODST Members battling Covenant forces and the Flood within 6 levels.

===Unrealized projects===
In the 2000s, spin-off titles were rumored or pitched for the Game Boy Advance, Gizmondo, Ultra-Mobile PC, and Nintendo DS. An episodic video game, &quot;Halo: Chronicles&quot;, was announced in 2006. To be developed by film director Peter Jackson&#x27;s Wingnut Interactive, it was canceled as part of budget cuts tied to job layoffs in January 2009. Ensemble Studios developed a &quot;Halo&quot;-themed massively multiplayer online game, &quot;Titan&quot;. The project was canceled internally in 2007–2008, as Microsoft lost interest in a PC-based game. Certain Affinity was slated to develop their own &quot;Halo&quot; title, but it was never greenlit because the team was needed to develop the Halo Waypoint online portal instead. A Mega Bloks-branded spinoff game, similar to the style of Lego video games, was prototyped for the Xbox 360 but not pursued; footage of the game leaked several years later in 2017.
343 Industries announced a free-to-play &quot;Halo&quot; multiplayer game for Windows PC, &quot;Halo Online&quot;, in 2015. The game launched with a closed beta test limited to Russia that year. The title was developed with Saber Interactive using modified version of the &quot;Halo 3&quot; engine, and published by Innova Systems. The project was canceled in August 2016. Players modified the game to circumvent the region limitations and add new content after the project&#x27;s official cancellation. This &quot;ElDewrito&quot; project saw legal takedowns from Microsoft for violating its game usage rules. The modders claimed its ElDewrito&#x27;s popularity hastened Microsoft&#x27;s plans to release a Windows version of &quot;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&quot;, which would later include content from &quot;Halo Online&quot;.

==Cultural influences and themes==

Bungie acknowledged that the &quot;Halo&quot; series&#x27; use of ring-shaped megastructures followed on from concepts featured in Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Ringworld&quot; and Iain M. Banks&#x27; Culture series (of which &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot; and &quot;Excession&quot; were said to be particularly influential.) Jaime Griesemer commented that the influence of &quot;Ringworld&quot; was less in the appearance of the Halo rings, but instead &quot;in that feeling of being somewhere else. That sense of scale and an epic story going on out there.&quot; Griesemer also explained, &quot;One of the main sources of inspiration was &quot;Armor&quot; [by John Steakley], in which a soldier has to constantly re-live the same war over and over again. That sense of hopelessness, a relentless battle, was influential.&quot; The Flood were influenced by the assimilating alien species in Christopher Rowley&#x27;s &quot;The Vang&quot;; it has also been speculated that the Master Chief&#x27;s name &quot;John 117&quot; may have been a reference to a character named Jon 6725416 in Rowley&#x27;s &quot;Starhammer&quot;, or to the John Spartan character of &quot;Demolition Man&quot;. An IGN article exploring the literary influences present in the &quot;Halo&quot; franchise commented on similarities between &quot;Halo&quot; and Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;: aspects of the SPARTAN Project and the design of the Covenant Drones are perceived as reminiscent of the super soldier program and Buggers found in the novel. Bungie has also acknowledged James Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;Aliens&quot; as a strong cinematic influence.

A report written by Roger Travis and published by &quot;The Escapist&quot; compares &quot;Halo&quot; with the Latin epic &quot;Aeneid&quot;, written by classical Roman poet Virgil. Travis posits similarities between the plots of both works and compares the characters present in them, with the Flood and Covenant taking the role performed by the Carthaginians and Master Chief taking the role of Aeneas.

The &quot;Halo&quot; franchise draws heavily from religious iconography and nomenclature. The Flood and especially the Gravemind serve as demonic or satanic figures, and the Master Chief&#x27;s first encounter with the Flood can be likened to a journey to hell. Academic P.C. Paulissen notes that the name &#x27;Flood&#x27; suggests a reference to the biblical deluge, with the Forerunner Ark being shelter from the Flood&#x27;s destructive and cleansing power akin to the Bible.

==Esports==
Players began creating impromptu &quot;Halo&quot; tournaments and local parties after the release of the first game. Bungie looked at the success of these matches as inspiration for crafting the online multiplayer components of &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Larger organizations soon began operating &quot;Halo&quot; competitive games. In August 2002, G4 hosted the Halo National Championship Finals, a FFA [free-for-all] tournament involving sixteen players from across the country (hosted by Wil Wheaton of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame.) The Associates of Gaming Professionals (AGP), which focused solely on &quot;Halo&quot;, held its first event in November 2002. Inspired by friends placing bets on their &quot;Halo&quot; matches, Mike Sepso and Sundance DiGiovanni formed Major League Gaming the same year.

Microsoft and 343 Industries sponsored their own professional &quot;Halo&quot; league, called the Halo Championship Series (HCS), in 2014. It was started in partnership with the Electronic Sports League (ESL). Seasons 1 and 2 ran on &quot;The Master Chief Collection&quot;. In August 2015 Microsoft announced it would be increasing the total prize pool of the HCS to US$1 million, for the newly announced Halo World Championship, which will be the debut event for &quot;Halo 5&quot;. This prize pool was later announced to be crowd-funded, which later resulted in Major League Gaming announcing that the prize pool had climbed to US$2 million. Later that week, 343 announced that the prize pool was locked at US$2.5 million. This was the largest console esports prize pool ever.

==Forge==

First introduced in &quot;Halo 3&quot;, Forge is an in-game map editor designed for adjusting weapon, vehicle, and prop placement. While in Editor Mode, the player becomes a floating robot, or &quot;monitor&quot;, who can spawn, move, and delete any game object on the map. All objects are assigned a monetary value, and cost money to spawn; the level&#x27;s &quot;Forge budget&quot; determines how much money the player can use to spawn objects. Outside of its intended use as a map editor, Forge was used to create draw pictures or write messages. Fan content inspired a popular user-created Forge map and game mode styled after rugby called Grifball, which would become an official game mode in later releases In subsequent games, the Forge editor would gain new capabilities.

==Music==


Martin O&#x27;Donnell and Michael Salvatori collaborated to produce the soundtracks for Bungie&#x27;s &quot;Halo&quot; games. Approached by Bungie to produce something ancient and mysterious for &quot;Halo&quot;″s debut, O&#x27;Donnell decided to use Gregorian chant, joining in with others to sing the vocal parts. The music was designed to change dynamically based on what was occurring in-game; for a more enjoyable listening experience on the soundtrack releases, O&#x27;Donnell arranged the music into standalone suites. For &quot;Halo 2&quot;, the soundtrack included licensed music from Incubus and Breaking Benjamin alongside the orchestral score; rock guitar virtuoso, Steve Vai, performed various solos throughout the score.

For &quot;Halo 3&quot;, O&#x27;Donnell noted he wanted to bring back the themes from the original game to help tie together the end of the trilogy. The tracks are presented, similarly to the previous soundtrack for &quot;Halo 2&quot;, in a suite form. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack for &quot;Halo 3&quot; was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24-voice chorus. A soundtrack for &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot; was released alongside the game and included many of the tracks from the game. For Bungie&#x27;s last game in the Halo series, &quot;Halo: Reach&quot;, Martin O&#x27;Donnell and Michael Salvatori returned to compose the soundtrack. O&#x27;Donnell wrote &quot;somber, more visceral&quot; music to reflect the darker nature of the campaign and style of the game. As Bungie had been making &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot; and &quot;Halo: Reach&quot; at the same time, Martin O&#x27;Donnell had also been composing the soundtracks at the same time, but production for the music of &quot;Halo: Reach&quot; did not begin until after the release of &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot;.
The music of &quot;Halo&quot; helped spur a renewed interest in chant music.

For &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, the task of creating the game&#x27;s music fell to Stephen Rippy. Rippy listened to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s soundtracks for inspiration and incorporated the &quot;Halo&quot; theme into parts of his arrangements. In addition to synthesized and orchestral components, the composer focused on the choir and piano as essential elements, feeling these were important in creating the &quot;&quot;Halo&quot; sound&quot;.

The music of &quot;Halo 4&quot; was composed by Neil Davidge and Kazuma Jinnouchi. The &quot;Halo 4 Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on October 22, 2012, followed by a two-disc Special Edition on November 6. Neil Davidge served as an out-of-house composer for 343 Industries which proved to be very expensive leading Kazuma Jinnouchi to take over the responsibility of music production for &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;. The music by Neil Davidge and Kazuma Jinnouchi for &quot;Halo 4&quot; received mixed reviews, being recognized as creative music but too different from the original Halo formula. Jinnouchi returned to compose the music for &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;. 

In 2017, 343 Industries and Creative Assembly released a sequel to &quot;Halo Wars&quot; titled &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot;. The soundtrack was composed by Gordy Haab, Brian Lee White and Brian Trifon under the direction of Paul Lipson who had helped in the audio and music of nearly every previous Halo title. The &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot; soundtrack featured many melodies from the music that Stephen Rippy had composed for the first &quot;Halo Wars&quot; but with new arrangements and more melodies to represent the individual characters. The original game soundtrack was released on February 17, 2017, and released digitally on February 21, 2017.

The music for &quot;Halo Infinite&quot; was a collaboration between Gareth Coker, Curtis Schweitzer, Joel Corelitz, Alex Bhore, and Eternal Time &amp; Space, overseen by 343 Industries Music Supervisor Joel Yarger. &quot;Infinite&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack was released digitally on December 8, 2021, in two albums, one covering the score for the campaign, and another covering the music for the game&#x27;s multiplayer component.

==Other media==

The &quot;Halo&quot; franchise includes various types of merchandise and adaptations outside of the video games. This includes bestselling novels, graphic novels, and other licensed products, from action figures to a packaging tie-in with Mountain Dew. Numerous action figures and vehicles based on &quot;Halo&quot; have been produced. Joyride Studios created &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot; action figures, while &quot;Halo 3&quot; poseable and collectible action figures, aimed at collectors, were produced by McFarlane Toys and became some of the top-selling action figures of 2007 and 2008. MEGA Bloks has partnered with Microsoft to produce &quot;Halo&quot;-themed toys. 

===Books===
As part of Microsoft&#x27;s multimedia efforts, Microsoft Studios decided to create a tie-in novel for &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;. Eric Nylund wrote &quot;&quot; in seven weeks, and it was published in October 2001. Nylund would write additional &quot;Halo&quot; works including the novels &quot;&quot; (2003) and &quot;&quot; (2006). The game itself was turned into a novelization by William C. Dietz in 2003, called &quot;&quot;. Other novels have been written by Joseph Staten (&quot;&quot;), Tobias S. Buckell, Karen Traviss, Greg Bear (&quot;The Forerunner Saga&quot;), Matt Forbeck, John Shirley, Troy Denning, Cassandra Rose Clarke, and Kelly Gay.

A collection of &quot;Halo&quot; short stories, &quot;Halo: Evolutions&quot;, was simultaneously released in print and audiobook formats in November 2009. &quot;Evolutions&quot; includes original material by Nylund, Buckell, Traviss, and contributions from Bungie. Tor re-released the first three &quot;Halo&quot; novels with new content and cover art. Another collection, &quot;Halo: Fractures&quot;, compiled new and previously released short fiction in 2016.

===Comics===
The &quot;Halo&quot; universe was adapted into comics in 2006 with the release of &quot;The Halo Graphic Novel&quot;, a collection of four short stories published by Marvel Comics. Marvel produced a number of other &quot;Halo&quot; comic series. &quot;&quot;, by Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev, bridges the gap between the events of &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Halo 3&quot;; initially planned to conclude shortly before the release of &quot;Halo 3&quot; in 2007, delays led to the final issue being published April 2009. Two additional comic runs were announced in 2009. Peter David&#x27;s series, &quot;Halo: Helljumper&quot;, is set prior to &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; and focuses on the elite Orbital Drop Shock Troopers. The five-part series was published between July and November 2009. Fred Van Lente&#x27;s series, &quot;Halo: Blood Line&quot;, revolves around a black ops team of Spartan supersoldiers assigned to the UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence, and debuted in December 2009. Marvel also released a three-part comic adaptation of the novel &quot;Halo: The Fall of Reach&quot; in 2011.

Dark Horse Comics has produced a number of &quot;Halo&quot; series, beginning with the three-part series &quot;Halo: Initiation&quot;, released in August 2013. Also announced was &quot;Halo: Escalation&quot;, an ongoing comic series covering the period directly after &quot;Halo 4&quot;; it ran for 24 issues from 2013 to 2015.
===Live-action===
====Unproduced feature====

In 2005, Columbia Pictures president Peter Schlessel began working outside the studio system to produce a &quot;Halo&quot; film adaptation. Alex Garland wrote a script, which was then pitched to studios by couriers dressed as Master Chief. Microsoft&#x27;s terms required $10 million against 15 percent of gross; most studios passed, citing the lack of risk for Microsoft compared to their large share of potential profits. 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures decided to partner to produce the film, paying Microsoft $5 million to option the film and 10 percent of grosses. Peter Jackson was slated to be the executive producer, with Neill Blomkamp as director. Before Blomkamp signed on, Guillermo del Toro was in negotiations to direct.

D. B. Weiss and Josh Olson rewrote Garland&#x27;s script during 2006. Pre-production of the film was halted and restarted several times. Later that year, 20th Century Fox threatened to pull out of the project, leading Universal to issue an ultimatum to Jackson and Schlessel: either reduce their large &quot;first-dollar&quot; revenue deals, or the project was ended. Both refused, and the project stalled. Blomkamp would produce a series of live-action shorts as promotion for &quot;Halo 3&quot;, collectively titled &quot;Halo: Landfall&quot;. The rights for the film reverted to Microsoft.

====&quot;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&quot;====

&quot;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&quot; is a live-action film and miniseries set in the Halo universe. Although shot as a feature-length film, &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot; was originally released as a webseries consisting of five episodes released between October 5, 2012, and November 2, 2012. The series&#x27; plot, occurring in the early days of the Human-Covenant War, revolves around Thomas Lasky, a young cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science, and how John-117 inspired him to eventually become a leader. Lasky is also a prominent character in &quot;Halo 4&quot; as a commander on the UNSC Infinity. The name of the series, aside from being a reference to the UNSC frigate &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot;, is given new significance in the series as part of a running motif based on a poem. The film cut was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2012.

====&quot;Halo: Nightfall&quot;====
On April 3, 2014, it was announced that Ridley Scott and his production company, Scott Free Productions, were working on a &quot;Halo&quot; digital feature alongside 343 Industries and Xbox Entertainment Studios; Scott would be the executive producer, with David W. Zucker and Sergio Mimica-Gezzan as the directors. The feature was expected to follow the same format as Machinima&#x27;s &quot;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&quot;. On June 9, 2014, it was announced at E3 2014 that the feature, titled &quot;Halo: Nightfall&quot;, would be included with &quot;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&quot; at its November 2014 launch. The feature introduces a new character to the franchise, Agent Jameson Locke, played by actor Mike Colter; &quot;Nightfall&quot; is considered to be his origin story. Locke is one of the Spartans portrayed on the cover art and plays a large role in the series. On July 24, 2014, 343 Industries released the first trailer for the feature. &quot;Halo: Nightfall&quot; is available to watch through Halo Channel, an application for the Xbox One, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone. On March 16, 2015, the series became available to stream, download, and buy on physical disc.

====Paramount+ television series====

On May 21, 2013, Xbox Entertainment Studios and 343 announced that a live-action television show of &quot;Halo&quot; would be produced with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer through what is now Amblin Television. It was originally titled &quot;Halo: The Television Series&quot;. Later, it was announced the series would premiere on the American premium cable network Showtime. The series subsequently sat in development hell for many years; the series began casting in 2019 and filming in 2021. The series premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022.
===Animation===

Microsoft announced at Comic-Con 2009 that it was overseeing production of a series of seven short anime films, together called &quot;Halo Legends&quot;. Financed by 343 Industries, the animation was created by six Japanese production houses: Bee Train Production, Bones, Casio Entertainment, Production I.G., Studio 4°C, and Toei Animation. Shinji Aramaki, creator and director of &quot;Appleseed&quot; and &quot;Appleseed Ex Machina&quot;, served as the project&#x27;s creative director. Warner Bros. distributed &quot;Legends&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2010. Six of the stories are officially part of the &quot;Halo&quot; canon, with the seventh, made by Toei, intended to be a parody of the universe.

An animated version of &quot;The Fall of Reach&quot; is included in the &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot; Limited Edition and Collector&#x27;s Edition.

==Legacy==


Sales of games in the &quot;Halo&quot; series were more than 81 million by 2021. Total franchise sales were reported at $6 billion the same year. Non-game merchandise grosses counted for $1.8 billion of that figure. Many of the &quot;Halo&quot; novels have appeared on &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestsellers lists, and multiple &quot;Halo&quot; soundtracks have charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
&quot;Halo&quot; redefined first-person shooters on consoles and was a major component in the Xbox console&#x27;s early success. &quot;Halo&quot;″s success led to the term &quot;&quot;Halo&quot; killer&quot; being used to describe console games that aspire, or are considered, to be better than &quot;Halo&quot;. It was the Xbox&#x27;s killer app. In a retrospective of &quot;Halo 2&quot;, journalist Anthony John Agnello described the game&#x27;s impact as akin to the astroid hit that killed the dinosaurs, remaking the gaming landscape and creating the modern conception of games as shared social experiences.
In 2007 IGN listed &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; as the top Xbox game of all time, while readers ranked it the fourteenth best game ever on &quot;IGN Readers&#x27; Choice 2006 – The Top 100 Games Ever&quot;. IGN listed &quot;Halo 2&quot; as the number two top Xbox game of all time in March 2007. &quot;Halo 3&quot; was nominated for and won multiple awards; it won &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and IGN chose it as the Best Xbox 360 Online Multiplayer Game and Innovative Design of 2007. Most publications called the multiplayer aspect one of the best features; IGN said the multiplayer map lineup was the strongest of the series, and GameSpy added that the multiplayer offering will greatly please &quot;&quot;Halo&quot; veterans&quot;. Complaints focused on the game&#x27;s plot. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the game had a &quot;throwaway&quot; plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. The series&#x27; music and audio has received enthusiastic response from game reviewers.

The musical theme and Master Chief are considered gaming icons, and the Chief and Halo are considered important mascots and aspects of the Xbox brand.

&quot;GamesTM&quot; stated &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot; &quot;changed video game combat forever&quot;, and &quot;Halo 2&quot; showcased Xbox Live as a tool for communities. Game Daily noted &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s launch was &quot;easily comparable to the biggest in other sectors of the entertainment industry&quot;, marking the first time a video game launch has become a major cultural event in the United States. &quot;Halo&quot; has been described as a series that &quot;has reinvented a genre that didn&#x27;t know it needed to be reinvented&quot;, with aspects of the main trilogy being duplicated in other first-person shooter games multiple times.

&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Halo&quot; &quot;the equivalent of &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot;.

Characters and elements from the series have made their way to other games such as &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, &quot;Forza&quot;, and &quot;Fortnite&quot;.

Ed Fries, former vice president of game publishing at Microsoft, published a demake of &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Halo 2600&quot;, for the Atari 2600.

The &quot;Halo&quot; franchise spurred an array of productions in an emerging genre of machinima—the use of games for filmmaking. Most productions are set outside &quot;Halo&quot; canon, while others are based on fan fiction closely relating to the story. &quot;Halo 3&quot; includes a saved film function that allows camera angles not possible in previous games, and other features that simplify production. The game has become one of the most popular tools for generating machinima, and Microsoft updated its user license agreement to allow noncommercial distribution of such films. Among the notable machinima productsion made with &quot;Halo&quot; is the comedy series &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot; created by Rooster Teeth Productions. It has achieved an unparalleled level of success in &quot;Halo&quot; machinima in specific, and machinima in general; it is credited with bringing attention to the genre. Other machinima series include &quot;Arby ‘n the Chief&quot;, &quot;Fire Team Charlie&quot;, &quot;The Codex&quot;, and the in-game interview show &quot;This Spartan Life&quot;.

<text>A defoliant is any herbicidal chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause their leaves to fall off. Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and pesticides, allowed for the Green Revolution, an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century. Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the United Kingdom during the Malayan Emergency and the United States in the Vietnam War. Defoliants were also used by Indonesian forces in various internal security operations.

== Use and application ==
A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical herbicides used as defoliants are 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth. These phenoxy herbicides were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of World War II and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War.

Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly cotton, in the United States as well as a number of other cotton-producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality. The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest-aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and thidiazuron. According to a 1998 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.

==Examples of defoliants==

In Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, the Rainbow Herbicides were a group of tactical-use chemicals used by the United States military. The environmental destruction caused by this defoliation has been described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide.

== Health and environmental effects ==
In 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and marine life. High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible carcinogen and a toxin to freshwater and marine invertebrates. Dimethipin has also been labeled as a possible human carcinogen.

A published study in the &quot;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&quot; reported that through successive surface runoff events in defoliated cotton fields, defoliant concentrations decreased exponentially within the test area and could negatively affect marine life in the runoff zones.

Agent Orange, a defoliant used by the United Kingdom during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s and the United States during the Vietnam War to defoliate regions of Vietnam from 1961 to 1971, has been linked to several long-term health issues. Agent Orange contains a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T as well as dioxin contaminants. Members of the Air Force Ranch Hand and the Army Chemical Corps who served in the Vietnam War were occupationally exposed to Agent Orange have a higher incidence of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases.

Among other occupations, farmers are at a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease due to a greater chance of defoliant exposure.

<doc id="1205881" wikidata="Q4947417" url="?curid=1205881" title="Bosnian and Herzegovinian hip-hop">
<text>Bosnian hip hop is a style of music made in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Although quite a new music style in Bosnia, it has nevertheless proven to be very popular. The hip hop scene has coalesced around several major portals on the internet. The center of hip hop and hip hop culture used to be only Tuzla, primarily thanks to the first radio hip hop show and label called FMJAM and their crew, with the big help of popular rappers Edo Maajka and Frenkie.

==Recent==
Today, hip hop is more popular than ever before. Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar are three cities that are the most popular ones today, when it comes to new releases and hip hop happenings and concerts. Artists like Mayer and crew&#x27;s like Malter, DoggSound, REVSKL and HighTime, are currently the most popular ones in Mostar. While in Sarajevo artists like Buba Corelli and from BluntBylon and crews like Capital City Crew, Treća Smjena Crew including Sajfer and Santos, G-Recordz etc. belong in the category of the most popular and listened artists in the country.

For the first time in history of Bosnian hip hop culture, it is possible to hear and find new songs and videos on TV, which was almost unheard of back in the 2000s. Media picture of hip hop is growing with BHOP Portal being the most updated website when it comes to being the place to find everything that is currently happening in Bosnian hip hop, and currently it is the most visited internet website that specifically covers the Bosnian hip hop scene. FMJAM is the most popular crew and private &#x27;net&#x27; label in the country, and their radio is going on strong for more than ten years with DJ Soul as the main DJ. Facebook and YouTube still remain the main tool artists use to develop their fan base, because even though hip hop has gotten more popular in Bosnia, it is still nowhere near the level other popular music styles are, when it comes to fans, media coverage and anything else of that sort.

==History of Bosnian Hip Hop==
In the late 1980s, a rapper emerged name &quot;Elvir Reper&quot;, who never recorded any songs, but did actively engage in rapping and is credited as introducing hip hop material from popular American hip hop acts at that time.

Because of the war in Bosnia that started in 1992, hip hop stopped for a while, only to be revived by what has become known as the second wave of hip hop. Artists such as Alaga, Mr. Johnny (Sarajevo) Crni Zvuk, Kwonel and MC Fudo (Tuzla) emerged with numerous demo songs, played on radios, concerts, and became popular around their town of Sarajevo.

Numerous attempts and limited exposure on radio was a problem until 1999, when DJ Soul and Erol created the first Bosnian hip hop station FMJAM.

With the help of FMJAM, the first songs were produced in a studio. After numerous shows, FMJAM helps create the hip hop group Disciplinska Komisija, with the lead rapper Edo Maajka, who would lead the revival movement in Bosnian hip hop.

A little later FMJAM establishes themselves enough to be able to create a website, on which a number of demo songs were released on. With these demo songs and the organization that FMJAM provided, Bosnian hip hop for the first time had an organization to rely on to have the resources available to provide for future acts and organize concerts and hip hop gatherings for the youth.

Although FMJAM played a large role in organizing Bosnian hip hop, it is recognized by the majority of media that Edo Maajka was the artist, with his 2002 debut album, that introduced hip hop to the majority of Bosnia, thus allowing FMJAM to continue their work.

==Diaspora==
Although different, Bosnian hip hop has also proven itself very popular and successful throughout the United States. With the introduction of the group Slicc &amp; Aone, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bosnian hip hop made its debut in the United States. The duo gained popularity quickly, which also opened up a new path to oncoming Bosnian-American hip hop artists. Other notable Bosnian hip hop artists throughout the U.S. include Rima D, Rnel, Prah, Opijum Veza, Gazije, Udarna Snaga and KoCity RimeS.

==Modern Hip Hop and Auto-Tune fusions==
Today, we have many artists who emerged in the last 10 years who mix Hip Hop with Pop, EDM, Folk, Trap and Ethnic sounds. Almost all of them use an Auto-Tune to create distinguished sound. Hip hop artists like Future, Travis Scott, Young Thug and Lil Uzi Vert use Auto-Tune to create a signature sound. The effect has also become popular in Rap music and other genres in Balkans. The main Bosnian artists in this subgenre are Jala Brat, Buba Corelli, Sajfer, Inas, Cunami, Albino, SMA, Valderrama Flow, Medico, Mehdi, Loš Sin, Klijent, Arpino Sachi and Franco Balkan.

<text>Clemens Alexander Winkler (December 26, 1838 – October 8, 1904) was a German chemist who discovered the element germanium in 1886, solidifying Dmitri Mendeleev&#x27;s theory of periodicity.

== Life ==

Winkler was born in 1838 in Freiberg, Kingdom of Saxony the son of a chemist who had studied under Berzelius. Winkler&#x27;s early education was at schools in Freiberg, Dresden, and Chemnitz. In 1857 he entered the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, where his knowledge of analytical chemistry surpassed what he was being taught there. Sixteen years later, Winkler was appointed a professor of chemical technology and analytical chemistry at the university.

Winkler was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1892.

In 1893, Winkler moved to Hamburg where he married his childhood sweetheart Tanja Braun.

In 1902, Winkler resigned his professorship. He died in Dresden two years later of carcinoma at the age of 65.

According to Brunck, Winkler wrote poetry, and according to McCay, Winkler&#x27;s talents extended to playing several musical instruments.

==Discovery of germanium==
In 1886, Winkler was provided with a new mineral from the Himmelsfürst mine near Freiberg. The mineral, called argyrodite, was found by chemists to contain silver and sulfur. When Winkler subsequently analyzed the mineral, he found that the individual components only added up to about 93–94% of its total mass, leading him to suspect that a new and previously unknown element must be present. After additional chemical purification steps over several months, Winkler isolated the pure element, germanium, on February 6, 1886 and published his results. The mineral argyrodite that was Winkler&#x27;s start toward finding germanium is now known to be a double sulfide with formula GeS2 · 4Ag2S.

To place germanium into the periodic table, Mendeleev suggested that it might be ekacadmium, an element he had predicted earlier. In contrast, Lothar Meyer favored an identification of germanium with ekasilicon, a different predicted element. Winkler isolated more of the pure material, and eventually obtained enough to measure some of its physical and chemical properties. His results showed unequivocally that Meyer&#x27;s interpretation was the correct one and that nearly all of the new element&#x27;s properties matched Mendeleev predictions. The close match between what had been predicted for ekasilicon and what was found for germanium was clear evidence for the utility and power of the periodic table and the concept of periodicity.

== Other work ==

In addition to his isolation and study of germanium, Winkler investigated the analysis of gases. He published a book on the subject, &quot;Handbook of Technical Gas Analysis&quot;, in 1884. In that book Winkler describes his invention of the three-way stopcock. He predicted the existence of silicon monoxide, SiO, and was the first to attempt to produce it by heating silica with silicon in 1890. However, he was unsuccessful because he was not able to heat the mixture to a high enough temperature using a combustion furnace. As no reaction occurred for him, Winkler incorrectly concluded that SiO does not exist, even though it was reported to have formed from the reduction of silica with charcoal three years earlier by C. F. Maybery. However, Henry Noel Potter, a Westinghouse engineer, repeated Winkler&#x27;s experiment fifteen years later with an electric furnace, which enabled him to increase the reaction temperature by several hundred degrees and observe the generation of SiO.

<text>Illinois Route 131 (IL 131) is a north–south state route in northeastern Illinois. It extends south from Wisconsin Highway 31 and Lake CR A1/19 (128th Street) at the Illinois/Wisconsin state line by Pleasant Prairie, south to Illinois Route 176 in Lake Bluff, a distance of .

== Route description ==
Illinois 131 is called Green Bay Road for its entire length, but Green Bay Road becomes a residential street and extends south through various North Shore communities to Evanston, a distance of approximately south of Illinois 176. It is one of very few state routes whose named road is longer than the marked state road. Green Bay Road actually continues south to Old Elm Road (Lake CR 52) while there is a second segment of Green Bay Road that starts at a dead end in Highwood and ends at Ridge Avenue in Evanston. The Green Bay Road name also stretches continuously through Racine County and Kenosha County, WI, with route signage changing to Wisconsin Highway 31, before merging with Wisconsin Highway 32 north of Racine. However, other large portions of the formerly continuous Green Bay Road still bear the name, such as Green Bay Avenue in Milwaukee and several Green Bay Road segments in Ozaukee County.

The road parallels U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway), which is only a few miles to the west, and Illinois Route 137 (Amstutz Expressway), which is only a few miles to the east. It is the major north–south road between those two expressways.

== History ==
SBI Route 131 ran from Mattoon to Greenup in southeastern Illinois. This was dropped in 1937 for Illinois Route 121. The next year, Illinois 131 was used on a road that extended Highway 31 south into Illinois. This had formerly been Illinois Route 68. Had Illinois 31 not already been in use, the road south of Wisconsin may have been designated Illinois 31 instead.

<text>Dale Mabry (March 22, 1891 – February 21, 1922) was an American World War I aviator.

Mabry, a native of Tallahassee, Florida, was the son of former Florida Supreme Court Justice Milton H. Mabry and Ella Dale Bramlett. He went on to become an airship pilot and captain in the United States Army Air Service. Captain Mabry died at age 30 while commanding the Army dirigible &quot;Roma&quot; when it crashed and exploded in Norfolk, Virginia on February 21, 1922. The event marked the greatest disaster in American aeronautics up to that time, resulting in 34 deaths. Mabry was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by a brother, G. E. Mabry, of Tampa, Florida.
Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa, Florida is named for him. It was initially constructed to connect what was then MacDill Field, now MacDill Air Force Base, with then-Drew Field Municipal Airport, now Tampa International Airport. It is a major, highly commercialized roadway through Hillsborough County. Landmarks on this road include Hillsborough Community College, Raymond James Stadium, and George M. Steinbrenner Field. Also in Tampa, Dale Mabry Elementary School is named in his honor. A Tampa restaurant originally named Dale 1891 in his honor was remodeled and renamed during season 4 of &quot;Bar Rescue&quot;.

Dale Mabry Municipal Airport in Tallahassee, Florida, that city&#x27;s first airport, also bore his name. The original Tallahassee Airport location was on Dale Mabry Field, a World War II U.S. Army Air Corps, later U.S. Army Air Forces flight training facility.

<text>The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC; , CRSH), often colloquially pronounced &#x27;shirk&#x27; (), is a Canadian federal research-funding agency that promotes and supports post-secondary research and training in the humanities and social sciences. It is one of three major federal granting agencies (the others being the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and Canadian Institutes for Health Research) that together are referred to as the &quot;Tri-Council&quot; or &quot;Tri-Agency.

== History ==
Created by an act of the Parliament of Canada in 1977, SSHRC reports to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development. SSHRC came into existence on 1 May 1978 under the &quot;Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Act&quot; which was passed in an omnibus manner by the government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau.

== Governance ==
SSHRC creates policy, plans budgets, and directs priorities through a council established by the federal government. The appointed members are a mix of academics and representatives from the industry. They have the role of advising the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development on research policy in the areas of research and scholarship in the social sciences and humanities, with the goal of representing the interests of academic, public and private sectors. Council committees create and oversee SSHRC&#x27;s programs, determine the distribution of funds and handles the strategies for enacting the councils policies.

=== President ===
Past presidents include André Fortier (1977–?), William E. Taylor (also, William Ewart Taylor Jr), Paule Leduc (June 1988 to March 1994), Lynn Penrod (1994–1997), Marc Renaud (1997–2005), and Chad Gaffield (2006–2014). Ted Hewitt was appointed president of SSHRC in March 2015, and continues to serve as President.

== Programs ==
SSHRC funding opportunities are available through three programs: Talent, Insight and Connection.

=== Talent program ===
The Talent program is to support students and postdoctoral candidates to become researchers and leaders across society, both within academia and across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.

The program promotes research skills and assists in the training of highly qualified personnel in the social sciences and humanities. In this way, SSHRC fosters the development of talented and creative people who will become leaders across campuses and communities.

=== Insight program ===
The Insight program is to build knowledge and understanding about people, societies and the world by supporting research excellence in all subject areas eligible for funding from SSHRC. Research and training in the social sciences and humanities provide the foundation for a vibrant, healthy and prosperous society. They build knowledge and understanding about individuals, groups and societies.

The program aims to support and foster excellence in social sciences and humanities research intended to deepen, widen and increase collective understanding of individuals and societies, as well as to inform the search for solutions to societal challenges.

=== Connection program ===
The Connection program is to realize the potential of social sciences and humanities research for intellectual, cultural, social and economic influence, benefit and impact on and beyond the campus by supporting specific activities and tools that facilitate the flow and exchange of research knowledge.

Knowledge mobilization in the social sciences and humanities facilitates the multidirectional flow of research knowledge across academia and society as a whole, in order to inform Canadian and international research, debate, decisions and actions. Those who can benefit from publicly funded research results in the humanities and social sciences - diverse groups of researchers, policy-makers, business leaders, community groups, educators and the media. The program aims to support knowledge mobilization activities such as networking, disseminating, exchanging and co-creating research-based knowledge as an important element of publicly engaged scholarship, and as a means of strengthening research agendas. SSHRC also recognizes that rapidly evolving information and communications technologies provide new opportunities to engage a variety of audiences with an interest and/or involvement in social sciences and humanities scholarship.

A program entitled Canada 150 Connection has been set up for the 150th anniversary of Canada to support activities by post-secondary institutions and researchers that explore the contributions of social sciences and humanities research to Canadian society.

==Notable past SSHRC Scholars and Fellows include== 
* Nissim Mannathukkaren

== Future challenge areas ==
In June 2013, SSHRC&#x27;s governing council endorsed six future challenge areas developed during its Imagining Canada&#x27;s Future initiative, with a goal of addressing Canada&#x27;s future societal challenges and meeting future opportunities through social sciences and humanities research.

In a public discussion at the Press club in March 2017, Teesta recounted that despite coming from a family steeped in a legal heritage, she decided to pursue a career in journalism after reading a book that her father had bought her called &quot;All the President&#x27;s men&quot;. She subsequently went to college, studied law for two years, dropped out and then graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Bombay University in 1983 and started work as a journalist. She reported for the Mumbai editions of &quot;The Daily (India)&quot; and &quot;The Indian Express&quot; newspapers, and later for &quot;Business India&quot; magazine. Her first brush with communal violence came when she covered the riots in 1984 in Bhiwandi.

Setalvad&#x27;s career as a mainstream journalist was a decade long. In 1993, in response to the Hindu-Muslim riots in Mumbai, she and her husband quit their regular jobs to start &quot;Communalism Combat&quot;, a monthly magazine. According to Javed Anand (Setalvad&#x27;s husband and co-founder of Communalism Combat), the decision to break from mainstream journalism to start a magazine was because it was also a platform which gave them an opportunity to intervene in ways which they couldn&#x27;t have otherwise. The last print copy of the magazine was printed in November 2012. Subsequently, they moved to the digital domain by starting a website, which has subsequently been inactive.

Setalvad and her husband, along with others such as Father Cedric Prakash (a catholic priest), Anil Dharker (a journalist), Alyque Padamsee, Javed Akhtar, Vijay Tendulkar and Rahul Bose (all film &amp; theatre personalities) set up an NGO named &quot;Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP)&quot; on 1 April 2002. The NGO forthwith began to litigate in various courts against the alleged complicity of the Chief Minister and government of Gujarat state in the riots that had broken out shortly before. Their efforts met with partial success in April 2004, when the Supreme Court of India transferred the &quot;Best Bakery case&quot; to the neighbouring state of Maharashtra. At the same time, the court also overturned the recent acquittal of 21 accused and ordered that the investigation and trial be conducted afresh. By 2013, all the cases filed by CPJ had been dismissed at three levels of the judiciary (trial court, state High Court and the Indian Supreme Court) and only one appeal is pending. This is an appeal to the Supreme Court against a conviction handed out by the High Court to Maya Kodnani, a former minister in the government of Gujarat.

Teesta wrote the book &quot;A Footsoldier of the Constitution: A Memoir&quot; (2017) about her experiences in Gujarat. Her chapter, &#x27;Being Their Target&#x27;, from this book was reprinted in &quot;The Hunger of the Republic: Our Present in Retrospect&quot; (2021), part of the India Since the 90s series published by Tulika Books.

She has also authored the chapter &quot;When Guardians Betray:The Role of the Police&quot; in the book Gujarat:The making of a tragedy, edited by Siddharth Varadarajan and published by Penguin. The book is about the 2002 Gujarat riots.

=== Allegations of witness tampering ===

In November 2004, Setalvad was accused of pressuring Zaheera Sheikh, the key witness in the Best Bakery case, to make certain statements, leading to the unprecedented transferral of the case outside Gujarat. In August 2005, the Supreme Court of India committee absolved her of the charges of inducement levelled against her by Zaheera and awarded a one-year jail sentence to Zaheera for perjury. In 2013 Tehelka in an undercover investigation discovered that Zaheera had been paid to alter her testimony. Tehelka recorded BJP member Madhu Srivastava, described by Tehelka as a &quot;close associate of Narendra Modi&quot; and Batthoo Srivastava describing how they had paid Rs 1.8 million to Zaheera.

Teesta Setalvad&#x27;s former aide Rais Khan Pathan has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court alleging manipulation of evidence, which were in the form of statements of witnesses, by her in five sensitive post-Godhra riot cases.

In April 2009, the &quot;Times of India&quot; ran a story claiming that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Supreme Court of India to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riot cases had submitted before the Court that Teesta Setalvad had cooked up cases of violence to spice up the incidents. The SIT which is headed by former CBI director, R K Raghavan has said that false witnesses were tutored to give evidence about imaginary incidents by Teesta Setalvad and other NGOs. The SIT charged her of &quot;cooking up macabre tales of killings&quot;.

The court was told that 22 witnesses, who had submitted identical affidavits before various courts relating to riot incidents, were questioned by SIT and it was found that the witnesses had not actually witnessed the incidents and they were tutored and the affidavits were handed over to them by Setalvad. The report which was brought to the notice of the bench consisting of Justices Arijit Pasayat, P Sathasivam and Aftab Alam, noted that the much publicised case of a pregnant Muslim woman Kausar Bano being gangraped by a mob and foetus being removed with sharp weapons, was also fabricated, and false. However, Kausar Bano&#x27;s husband states alleges the doctors falsified the post-mortem despite his wife&#x27;s uterus having been removed from her body. The court that was trying the issue found beyond reasonable doubt that Babu Bajarangi killed Kausar Bano and her nine-month-old foetus by stabbing her in the stomach with a sword, but did not find sufficient evidence to prove that he removed the foetus from the uterus.

A day later, the Times of India published a letter from Citizens for Justice and Peace claiming that the report in question was not SIT report but a report by the Gujarat Government. The author of the Times article responded saying &quot;My report was based on the SIT report and not any document circulated by the Gujarat government, as suggested by CJP. Whether any section of the media has the report or not is irrelevant as TOI has access to the report.

R.K. Raghavan, the chairman of the SIT criticised the report leakage, saying, &quot;The alleged reported leaks appear to be inspired by dubious motives. I cannot confirm such claims. The act is highly condemnable&quot;. However, he refused to deny or confirm whether the leaked contents were true. The Supreme Court itself condemned the leaking of the SIT report as a &#x27;betrayal of trust&#x27; but did not deny the report itself. Raghvan noted that &quot;many incidents were cooked up, false witnesses were tutored to give evidence about imaginary incidents, and false charges levelled against the then Ahmedabad police chief P C Pandey&quot;.

===Allegations of misappropriation of funds===
In 2013, twelve residents of the Gulbarg Society who were the victim of Gujarat riots, accused Setalvad of collecting donations in the name of riot victims but failing to use them for their benefit and sent a legal notice to her. They claimed that she had collected huge donations from national and international organisations in the name of providing financial assistance for reconstruction of houses or developing the society into a museum but it was not passed to the members of the society. They also sought to ban her organisation &quot;Citizens for Justice and Peace&quot; and prevent them entering the society to organise programmes. The Ahmedabad Crime Branch is conducting an inquiry into the matter.

On 13 March 2013, the official representatives including the secretary and chairman of the Gulbarg Cooperative Housing Society in a letter to the joint commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, informed him that the letter-head of the society had been misused by some residents and the claims being made by them were patently false since nothing had been parted from them. A similar letter was also released to the media. In a press release CJP and Sabrang clarified that CJP never sought nor received any money for the museum. Sabrang Trust had raised an amount of Rs 460,285 nationally and internationally from donors for the purpose of the museum and since the plan has been abandoned because of the spiralling real estate prices, the matter is between the trust and the donors which they will address when final decision is taken. All other funds, nationally and internationally raised, have been funds legitimately collected for activities that they publicly engage in. Their accounts are audited and submitted to the relevant authorities. Subsequent to the letter written by the Gulbarg Society members to the police, the police sent them a letter asking for the status quo to be maintained while investigations were in progress. Later, the Crime Branch claimed that the complaint did not have any substance and instead filed an FIR against Setalvad.

After a First Information Report was filed by the Ahmedabad police on 4 January 2014 Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand were granted interim bail. According to the judge, similar relief has been provided in the past when false allegations were raised. The bail application stated that &quot;The FIR is a mala fide action of the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, to intimidate a human rights defender. This is the fifth time that a false criminal case has been lodged since 2004 because of me and my organization&#x27;s consistent legal support to the victims of 2002 riots ... Gulbarga cooperative housing society had been totally burnt down by politically motivated anti-social elements and 68 people had lost their lives in the massacre.&quot; It also said the accusation was brought by &quot;powerful forces in Gujarat who wish(ed) to stymie the appeal in the Zakia Jafri case&quot;.

On finding that the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad instead of acting on his complaint had filed an FIR against Setalvad and others, the Secretary of the Gulbarg Housing Society, Firoz Gulzar Pathan moved the court complaining against Gujarat police&#x27;s biased approach. The court sought a report from the Crime Branch. The Police responded by claiming that the complaint did not have any substance. This was countered by the complainant&#x27;s advocate who maintained that the Crime Branch had not even bothered to question the complainant before shelving the complaint. This led the magisterial court on 15 February 2014 to direct the city crime branch to lodge an FIR and start investigation against former residents of Gulbarg Society who had made the complaint against Setalvad last year. On 28 November 2014, local court rejected pleas filed by activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and their two NGOs seeking to de-freeze their bank accounts attached earlier by police in connection with the embezzlement case. On 12 February 2015, Gujarat High Court rejected Setalvad&#x27;s anticipatory bail plea regarding the case. However she was given an interim protection by the Supreme Court of India and on 19 March 2015, a two-judge bench of the Court referred the issue involved in her case to a large three-judge bench.

==Zakia Jafri-CJP petition==
Zakia Jafri-CJP Special leave petition seeks a criminal trial of Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat and the current Prime minister of India and 62 other politicians and government officials for alleged complicity in the Gujarat violence of 2002. The criminal conspiracy complaint alleges that in a meeting of senior police officers and officials convened by the then Chief minister Mr Modi on 27 February 2002 following the Godhra tragedy, he issued his &quot;let Hindus give vent to their anger&quot; directive. In all, there are 30 interrelated and closely interlocked allegations including
* parading dead bodies of Godhra victims to inflame passions
* police control rooms being manned by Cabinet ministers
* police investigations being botched
* VHP men being appointed as public prosecutors
* promotion of police officers like Mr M.K. Tandon and Mr P.B. Gondia, who faced serious charges of dereliction of duty as a result of which over 200 Muslims were killed in Gulbarg society, Naroda Patiya and Naroda Gaam in Ahmedabad
* penalising upright police officers
* ignoring intelligence warnings
* destruction of carnage-related records

In response to the petition, the Supreme Court on 27 April 2009 ordered the Special Investigation Team (SIT) they appointed to undertake the investigation. The SIT under the Chairmanship of R. K. Raghavan was originally formed to investigate nine major cases of riots in Gujarat in 2002.

The SIT submitted a preliminary report in May 2010. Chairman R. K. Raghavan submitted his comments to the report for perusal of the Supreme Court on 14 May 2010 Further investigation report was filed in November 2010. The Supreme Court in November 2010 appointed Raju Ramachandran as &quot;amicus curiae&quot; to assist the court in this case. The &quot;amicus curiae&quot; submitted a note dated 20 January 2011 to the Supreme Court.

On 15 March 2011, the Supreme Court directed SIT to examine the observations of the &quot;amicus curiae&quot;, to re-examine the entire evidence recorded and if some more evidence is required to be recorded, to do so. It observed that the SIT chairman&#x27;s inferences did not match with the findings of the SIT probe. Thereafter the SIT examined more witnesses and recorded their statements and submitted a further investigation report on 24 April 2011. On 5 May 2011, during a hearing in the Supreme Court, Shanti Bhushan, the counsel for Zakia Jafri, alleged that SIT was a doing cover-up job and sought copies of the investigation reports. The &quot;amicus curiae&quot; Raju Ramachandran informed the court that he had received a copy of an affidavit filed by Sanjiv Bhatt that he was present at a 27 February 2002 meeting convened by the chief minister where instructions were given to teach Muslims a lesson. The Supreme Court ordered &quot;The copies of the report, along with the comments of the chairman, be given to the amicus curiae, who shall analyse them in the light of evidence, statements of witnesses, and have his independent assessment of the entire evidence which has come on record&quot;. The court further said,&quot;If the amicus curiae, on the basis of evidence on record, finds that any offence is made out against any person, he shall mention the same in the report&quot;. The &quot;amicus curiae&quot; Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report where he found sufficient evidence to make Mr Modi stand trial.

Thereafter, the Court directed the SIT to submit the final report along with the entire material collected by them to the trial court. The SIT was also given access to the reports of the &quot;amicus curiae&quot; submitted earlier to the court. The SIT did not agree with his conclusion and filed the closure report on 8 February 2012. The trial court on 10 April 2012 observed that SIT had not found any evidence for the prosecution of Modi or any of the top bureaucrats or police officials and had recommended that the investigation be closed.

The court gave the complainant, Zakia Jafri, the option of filing a protest petition However SIT raised various objections to giving all the investigation papers to the petitioner and finally on 7 February 2013, the Supreme Court asked the SIT to hand over copies of all the reports and investigation papers to the petitioners. The protest petition was filed on 15 April 2013.

In April 2013, the SIT while opposing the protest petition filed by Zakia Jafri and CJP against SIT&#x27;s closure report submitted before a local court that &quot;Teesta Setalvad and others have falsified the complaint targeting the chief minister who had never said that go and kill people.&quot; Their lawyer further submitted that the so-called incident of Chief Minister (Narendra Modi) giving instructions (in the meeting) to high-level police officers not to take action against the rioters is a sole creation of Teesta Setalvad. There is no evidence to the same and that Setalvad was not present during the incident.

In their argument that sufficient grounds existed for ordering criminal prosecution of Modi, Zakia Jafri&#x27;s counsel told the court that SIT which gave Modi a clean chit, itself behaved like a conspirator and glossed over a wealth of official evidence which suggested State complicity in the incidents.
In June 2022, the Supreme Court on rejected plea by Zakia Jafri, and accused Setalvad of exploiting emotions of Jafri.

==Arrest and reactions==
In June 2022, she was arrested by the Anti Terrorism Squad of Gujarat Police for allegedly conspiring to implicate the Gujarat government functionaries in the 2002 Gujarat Riots. Amnesty International India has said that Setalvad&#x27;s arrest is a &#x27;direct reprisal&#x27; against human rights activists. Protests by citizens were held in Kolkata and Bangalore against her arrest. On 1 September 2022, the Supreme Court said that some details of the case were sketchy. These were: no chargesheet was filed while she was in custody since last 2 months, the registration of FIR was filed the day just after the Supreme Court dismissed Zakia Jafri&#x27;s case, the Gujarat High court granted a long adjournment, and there are no offences which stop the Gujarat High Court for granting the bail. The next day, Supreme Court granted her interim bail on the ground that she was a woman, leaving the decision of regular bail to the Gujarat High Court after which she was released from jail. The Gujarat High Court later denied her regular bail and directed her to surrender immediately, which was criticized by the Supreme Court as &quot;totally perverse&quot; and &quot;contradictory&quot; while granting her regular bail on 19 July 2023.
===Allegation that Teesta is being framed and hounded===
Though cases against Teesta are still in courts it has been suggested by some journalists that Teesta is being framed and hounded by Gujarat Police because of her criticism of Narendra Modi. It is alleged that allegations of corruption against Teesta are concocted. In a signed article in Outlook magazine, published in March 2015, Indira Jaising wrote that Teesta&#x27;s organization &quot;Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP)&quot; did creditable work in obtaining convictions for 119 people (including a Minister) for participating in the Gujarat riots. Jaising goes on to say that:

<text>Illinois Route 64 (IL 64, Illinois 64) is an east–west state highway in Northern Illinois. Its western terminus is at the Iowa state line, connecting with U.S. Route 52 (US 52) and Iowa Highway 64 via the Dale Gardner Veterans Memorial Bridge at the Mississippi River west of Savanna. IL 64 then travels east through Mount Carroll, Lanark, Mount Morris, Oregon, Sycamore, Lily Lake, Saint Charles and the western suburbs of Chicago before terminating at U.S. Route 41 (US 41, Lake Shore Drive) on the city&#x27;s north side. IL 64 is long.

==Route description==


IL 64 overlaps US 52 between the Iowa state line and Brookville—a distance of over —so that the IL 64 designation can continue to the Iowa border. East of the Mississippi River, IL 64 is largely a rural, undivided surface road from Savanna to the Fox River in Saint Charles.

At St. Charles, IL 64 enters the Chicago metro area and becomes a four-lane road, taking on the name of Main Street. Just east of St. Charles, IL 64 becomes North Avenue and retains this designation until just before its terminus in Chicago at US 41 (Lake Shore Drive). At IL 59, the road widens further from four to six lanes and becomes a divided highway until its intersection with IL 83 in Elmhurst. From Elmhurst to Interstate 294 (I-294) it remains a four-lane surface street, but it widens to a six-lane divided highway once again through the towns of Stone Park and Northlake. At the Des Plaines River and IL 43, North Avenue becomes four lanes until it reaches North Western Avenue. At this point, it becomes at times a two-lane road, for the rest of its route through Chicago. One-half mile (0.8 km) west of US 41, IL 64 turns north onto LaSalle Boulevard, and then east, before terminating at Lake Shore Drive.

North Avenue is a main east–west artery in Chicago itself, and one of only seven state routes to enter the city. It is located at the 1600 North parallel of Chicago. Just east of the Kennedy Expressway (I-90/I-94), the North Avenue Bridge carries IL 64 over the North Branch of the Chicago River. The hybrid suspension/cable-stayed bridge was built in 2006, replacing a bascule bridge dating back to 1907.

Between Halsted Street and Sheffield Avenue, North Avenue has become a shopping destination, known as the Clybourn Corridor.

== History ==

State Bond Initiative Route 64 was IL 64 from Sycamore to Chicago. The portion of the road in DuPage County was put through in 1928, the first highway through the county. In 1937, the road was extended west from Sycamore to what was then US 51 (and is now IL 251). Afterwards, it was extended further west to US 52, and then following it to the state line. Much like IL 92, there is no particular reason for extending IL 64 through Iowa and Nebraska, as existing U.S. Routes served any major cities on the State Route 64s better.

== Major junctions ==












== Truck route ==
IL 64 has one alternate route; Illinois Route 64 Truck (IL 64 Truck), a bypass around a truck-prohibited, residential section of Elmhurst. Eastbound truck traffic is rerouted north along IL 83, east along US 20 (Lake Street) and then onto I-290 before being allowed to return to IL 64. Westbound truck traffic follows the same route in reverse.

As early as 1989, the City of Elmhurst had sought to block trucks from traveling on North Avenue through its city limits. For a time, Illinois House of Representatives minority leader Lee Daniels supported a plan to reduce North Avenue from four lanes to two, prohibiting trucks from traveling through the residential neighborhood. By 1994, the village had agreed to reconstruct North Avenue and add a single set of left-turn lanes at Myrtle Avenue. Reconstruction of North Avenue in Elmhurst took place in 1997.

<text>Andrew Stevens (born Herman Andrew Stephens; June 10, 1955) is an American executive, film producer, director and actor.

==Early life==
Stevens was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the only child of actress Stella Stevens and her former husband Noble Herman Stephens. His mother was 16 when he was born. His parents divorced in 1957.

==Career==
Prior to his producing career, Stevens was a writer, director, and actor. He made his uncredited film debut in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (1963), had a bit role in &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), and went on to appear in cult thrillers such as &quot;Massacre at Central High&quot; (1976), &quot;Vigilante Force&quot; (1976) and &quot;Day of the Animals&quot; (1977), as well as the cult horror film &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978) starring Kirk Douglas. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance in &quot;The Boys in Company C&quot; (1978), and later starred with Charles Bronson in two films, &quot;Death Hunt&quot; (1981) and &quot;10 to Midnight&quot; (1983).

In 1975, he auditioned for the role of Luke Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), which eventually went to Mark Hamill.

He appeared in the miniseries &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; (1976) and played 17-year-old Andrew Thorpe on the NBC Western series &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;. The program filmed only thirteen episodes, seven of which never aired. He also acted in the Canadian television series &quot;The New Liars Club&quot;.

Stevens starred in &quot;The Bastard&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1979), based on the John Jakes novels. He appeared opposite Dennis Weaver and Susan Dey in the short-lived drama &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.&quot;, as a playboy/tennis bum in &quot;Columbo: Murder in Malibu&quot;, and as one of J.R.

He appeared in the miniseries &quot;Hollywood Wives&quot; (1985). During this time, he also wrote and starred in the erotic thriller &quot;Night Eyes&quot; (1990) and its sequels.

==Producing==

In early 1990, Stevens left the public eye to become an independent entrepreneur writing, producing, directing and financing films for his own companies. He was President/CEO of Franchise Pictures, which produced films for Warner Bros. from 1999 through 2005, including &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; and its sequel, &quot;The Whole Ten Yards&quot;, as well as &quot;The In-Laws&quot;.

Franchise and its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 19, 2004, after losing a multimillion-dollar fraud case in Los Angeles, and is now defunct.

Prior to Franchise, Stevens was an owner and president of Royal Oaks Entertainment, which produced and/or distributed seventy pictures over a three-year period including many HBO, Showtime and Sci-Fi Channel world premieres. Prior to Royal Oaks, Stevens&#x27; entrée into foreign sales and production company ownership was with Sunset Films International, which amassed a library of 19 titles (including seven in-house productions) during his first year as president of the company. He currently operates Andrew Stevens Entertainment and Stevens Entertainment Group.

In 2017, he published a screenwriting manual, &quot;Screenwriting for Profit: Writing for the Global Marketplace.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stevens was married to actress Kate Jackson from 1978 to 1982. He has three children by his second marriage to Robyn Suzanne Scott, which ended in divorce in 2010. Stevens married Diana Phillips Hoogland in 2016; they divorced two years later.

<doc id="1205935" wikidata="Q11866460" url="?curid=1205935" title="Jim Rose Circus">
<text>The Jim Rose Circus is a modern-day version of a circus sideshow. It was founded in Seattle in 1991 by Jim Rose and his wife BeBe Aschard Rose. The sideshow, then called the &quot;Jim Rose Circus Sideshow&quot;, came to prominence to an American audience as a second stage show at the 1992 Lollapalooza festival. although they had toured the Northwest and Canada and had several US TV appearances before this time. &quot; Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called the show an &quot;absolute must-see act&quot; and USA Today termed Rose&#x27;s troupe &quot;Lollapalooza&#x27;s word-of-mouth hit attraction&quot;.

==Tours==
In 1994, Jim Rose changed the lineup and dropped &quot;sideshow&quot; from the billing. He toured with Nine Inch Nails, Pop Will Eat Itself and Marilyn Manson. His 1997-98 world tours featured female sumo wrestling, Mexican transvestite wrestling, and chainsaw football. These shows were the pinnacle of the circus&#x27;s touring career.

==Performers==

Rose himself performs in between acts, mostly comedy but often stunts as well such as attaching paper currency to his forehead with a staple gun, driving a long nail into his nostril and having darts thrown into his back. During the show&#x27;s final act, he would escape from a straitjacket. His most outrageous trick followed: he would invite audience members to stand on his head after he had placed it in a shallow crate of broken glass.

* The Amazing Mister Lifto (Joe Hermann) who hung heavy weights (cinder blocks, steam irons, beer kegs, etc.) from his body piercings, including those in his nipples and genitalia. At Lollapalooza Lifto would perform the &quot;genital lift&quot; feat after spraying shaving cream on himself.
* Bebe the Circus Queen (Beatrice Aschard) would perform a variety of stunts such as having a watermelon placed on her back and split with a sword, lying on a bed of nails while weights were placed on her chest... or the &quot;Plastic Bag Of Death&quot;, where she gets into a large plastic bag and one of the other performers sucks all of the air out with a vacuum cleaner. She would also employ an electric grinder in her act (for example, she would create a shower of sparks from a metal chastity belt covering her groin area).
* Matt &quot;The Tube&quot; Crowley, whose moniker came from the seven feet of tubing that he would swallow. The other end of the tube was attached to a crude hand pump. Rose himself would fill the pump with a variety of fluids and proceed to pump it into Crowley&#x27;s stomach, then back out again. Audience members were invited onstage to drink the vile concoction after it had been extricated from Crowley. He would also provide a demonstration of sheer lung power by blowing up a hot water bottle with his mouth until it burst. Other gags included sucking a black condom in through his mouth and out his nose (and reversing the procedure) and working a long piece of plastic fluorescent cord through his nasal passages in order to &quot;floss&quot; his nose. 
* Zamora the Torture King (Tim Cridland) had a segment that featured him walking barefoot up and down a ladder of razor sharp sabres, piercing himself with long needles and meat skewers, eating pieces of a broken lightbulb (he would hold a microphone near his mouth so the audience would hear the sound), and touching an electrical generator while holding a fluorescent lightbulb that would glow. 
* The Enigma (Paul Lawrence), originally known as Slug, was billed as a man who would eat anything (including slugs, worms, and grasshoppers), and swallow a variety of swords. He also doubled as the show&#x27;s organ player. His body is completely tattooed with blue jigsaw puzzle pieces. 
* The Lizardman performed by Erik Sprague (born 1972) is a completely tattooed performer with a surgically split tongue (featured on Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not) joined Jim in 1999 on the Godsmack Voodoo Tour and in 2001 toured with just Jim and Bebe doing comedy clubs. He performed several acts previously done by members who had left.
* Cappy (David Capurro) is a yoyo artist. Featured in &quot;The Jim Rose Twisted Tour&quot;.
* Rupert (Ryan Stock) performed the traditional sideshow stunts. He now stars in his own show on the Discovery Channel with partner Amber Lynn.
* John Chaos performs traditional stunts. He later staged his own one-man show, the John Chaos Sideshow, mixing classic and new stunts with offbeat humor and magic tricks. Chaos still performs with the Jim Rose Circus from time to time.
* Jake &quot;the Snake&quot; Roberts
* Sinn Bodhi formally known as Kizarny of the WWE
* Brianna Belladonna, a female sword swallower who performed at Sturgis with the circus in 2010.
* Jimmy Coffin, a working act. Later he toured the US as a solo sideshow artist as the &quot;Jimmy Coffin Sideshow&quot;.
* &quot;Fat Matt&quot; Alaeddine, billed as the world&#x27;s fattest contortionist

==Television and other media==
Jim Rose and The Enigma were featured in the Season 2 episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Humbug&quot;.

Homer Simpson joins the Jim Rose Circus as a cannonball catcher (not to be confused with a human cannonball) on the episode &quot;Homerpalooza&quot; of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

2003 - 2005 &quot;The Jim Rose Twisted Tour&quot; a weekly travel show on the Travel Channel

==Publications==
Jim Rose&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Freak Like Me (Real, Raw, and Dangerous)&quot; with journalist Melissa Rossi was published in 1995 (). The book describes Rose&#x27;s early years and features a stream of consciousness on-the-road account of the Jim Rose Circus tour with Lollapalooza. The book&#x27;s title is a reference to &quot;Black Like Me&quot;.

Rose&#x27;s book &quot;Snake Oil: Life&#x27;s Calculations, Misdirections, And Manipulations&quot; was published in 2005.

==Politics==

According to an interview with &quot;Oddities Magazine&quot;, Jim Rose claims to have been involved in fundraising for the Mo Udall political campaign during a time in his life when he was addicted to heroin. He was quoted as stating that &quot;[Mo] ran against Jimmy Carter and I was his fundraiser... I used to do fundraisers with like Gregory Peck and Robert Redford, actually while I was on heroin. They didn’t know... actually I forgot to tell them.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the circus as an &quot;absolute must-see act&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the show as &quot;brutally comic&quot;, adding that Rose &quot;plays the highly-strung audience like a violin&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; compared the &quot;revolted amusement&quot; of the audience to that of tourists at a bullfight.

British Circus proprietor Gerry Cottle said, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of things in my time. I must see 40 circuses a year, but this lot... They came on in their street clothes and then... They&#x27;re beyond anything I&#x27;ve ever seen. They shocked me.&quot; &quot;The Times Magazine&quot; said that while it may not be everyone&#x27;s idea of entertainment, it certainly did not deserve to be banned.

<text>The Umatilla Indian Reservation is an Indian reservation in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was created by The Treaty of 9 June 1855 between the United States and members of the Walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla tribes. It lies in northeastern Oregon, east of Pendleton. The reservation is mostly in Umatilla County, with a very small part extending south into Union County. It is managed by the three Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

Located on the north side of the Blue Mountains, the reservation was established for two Sahaptin-speaking Native American tribes: the Umatilla and Walla Walla, and for the Cayuse, whose language, now extinct, was an isolate. All the tribes historically inhabited the Columbia Plateau region. The tribes share land and a governmental structure as part of their confederation.

==Geography, demographics and headquarters==
The reservation has a land area of and a tribal population of 2,927 as of the 2000 census. In addition, some 300 Native Americans from other regional tribes and 1,500 non-natives live on the reservation. The largest community is Mission, which is the site of the tribal headquarters as well as the Umatilla Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Some BIA agency offices serve more than one federally recognized tribe, but the Umatilla Agency exclusively serves the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR).

The CTUIR is one of several tribal governments in the northwestern United States to offer free bus service on its reservation.

==History==
The tribes developed the Wildhorse Casino Resort on their reservation to generate revenues for their people. The casino is located near Interstate 84. In 2006 it started Cayuse Technologies, to provide software development and related services. These enterprises employ 1,000 persons and have markedly reduced unemployment.

Pendleton photographer Walter S. Bowman photographed tribe members in the early 20th century. The CTUIR founded the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, a museum that provides both historical and contemporary exhibits related to the confederated tribes, as well as exhibits of contemporary Native American arts and traditional craftwork.

<doc id="1205940" wikidata="Q7606788" url="?curid=1205940" title="Stein factorization">
<text>In algebraic geometry, the Stein factorization, introduced by for the case of complex spaces, states that a proper morphism can be factorized as a composition of a finite mapping and a proper morphism with connected fibers. Roughly speaking, Stein factorization contracts the connected components of the fibers of a mapping to points.

==Statement==
One version for schemes states the following:

Let &quot;X&quot; be a scheme, &quot;S&quot; a locally noetherian scheme and formula_1 a proper morphism. Then one can write
:formula_2
where formula_3 is a finite morphism and formula_4 is a proper morphism so that formula_5
The existence of this decomposition itself is not difficult. See below. But, by Zariski&#x27;s connectedness theorem, the last part in the above says that the fiber formula_6 is connected for any formula_7. It follows:

Corollary: For any formula_8, the set of connected components of the fiber formula_9 is in bijection with the set of points in the fiber formula_10.

== Proof ==
Set: 
:formula_11
where Spec&quot;S&quot; is the relative Spec. The construction gives the natural map formula_3, which is finite since formula_13 is coherent and &quot;f&quot; is proper. The morphism &quot;f&quot; factors through &quot;g&quot; and one gets formula_4, which is proper. By construction, formula_15. One then uses the theorem on formal functions to show that the last equality implies formula_16 has connected fibers. (This part is sometimes referred to as Zariski&#x27;s connectedness theorem.)

<text>Carl Eduard Hellmayr (29 January 1878 – 24 February 1944) was an Austrian ornithologist.

==Biography==
Hellmayr was born in Vienna and studied at the University of Vienna, although he did not complete his degree. After his studies he worked in Vienna, Munich, Berlin, Paris, Tring (England), and Chicago.

He spent the years 1905–1908 studying Baron Rothschild&#x27;s private collection of natural history specimens at Tring, near London. There he received guidance from the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert.

In 1908, Hellmayr was appointed Curator of the Bird Department at the Bavarian State Museum, which he had helped organize in 1903 and where he became a specialist in Neotropical birds, studying Johann Baptist von Spix&#x27;s collection of Brazilian birds.

In 1922, he was made Curator in Zoology at the Field Museum in Chicago. He stayed there until 1931. His books included 13 of the 15 volumes of the &quot;Catalogue of Birds of the Americas&quot; (1918–1949), a work initiated by Hellmayr&#x27;s predecessor, Charles B. Cory. With Henry Boardman Conover he published &quot;The Birds of Chile&quot;.

In 1931, Hellmayr went back to Vienna. After the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, he was arrested and briefly jailed for reasons that are not fully known but probably related to his unsympathetic views toward the Nazi Party (Hellmayr did not make political statements in public, but his interest – as an amateur historian – in the French Revolution shows that he was more than casually interested in such topics). After his release he emigrated with his wife to Switzerland. Following a long period of declining health, he died in 1944 in Orselina, near Locarno.

Historian François Vuilleumier writes that &quot;Hellmayr&#x27;s pivotal role was first and foremost to bring order to [the] nomenclatural chaos&quot; of his day that had resulted in erroneous citations and hindered analysis of species and genera.

<text>Roquebrune-Cap-Martin (; or ; ; ), simply Roquebrune until 1921, is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region, Southeastern France, between Monaco and Menton. The name was changed from Roquebrune to differentiate the town from Roquebrune-sur-Argens in neighbouring Var.

==History==
In pre-Roman times the area was settled by the Ligurians. Traces of their language can be still found in the local dialect. The commune (originally known as &quot;Roccabruna&quot;) was founded in 971 by Conrad I, Count of Ventimiglia, in order to protect his western border.

In 1355, Roccabruna fell under the control of the Grimaldi family of Monaco for five centuries, during which time the castle was strengthened.

In 1793, Roquebrune became French for the first time, changing the name from the original Roccabruna, but it was returned to Monaco in 1814. In 1804 Napoleon built a road along the coastline. This road connected the village to the rest of the Côte d&#x27;Azur, and eventually led to its merger with the smaller town of Cap-Martin.

In 1848, there was a revolution related to the Italian Risorgimento, with the result that Roccabruna and Menton became free cities under the protection of the Savoy Prince. The Free Cities of Menton and Roquebrune hoped to be part of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia, but this did not occur, and the towns after two years of independence were administered by the House of Savoy for ten years. They were finally ceded to France by a plebiscite in 1861.

Nice-born Giuseppe Garibaldi, who promoted the union of the County of Nice to Italy, complained that the plebiscite was not done with &quot;universal vote&quot; and consequently Roccabruna was requested by Italian irredentists.
From the middle of the 19th century, with the construction of the Marseille–Ventimiglia railway line, this stretch of coast also became a magnet for well-known personalities as a holiday home. Elisabeth of Austria spent several months of the last years of her life from 1894 to 1897 at the Hôtel du Cap Martin. Eugénie, widow of Napoleon III, owned a villa here. 
As a consequence of these irredentism ideals, during World War II all the coastal area between Italy and Monte Carlo was occupied and administered by the Kingdom of Italy until September 1943.

The area became fashionable in the 1920s and 1930s leading to the construction of several notable buildings including Coco Chanel&#x27;s La Pausa on Cap Martin, and Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici&#x27;s E-1027.

The Irish poet and Nobel Laureate William Butler Yeats died in the Hôtel Idéal Séjour in the neighboring town of Menton on 28 January 1939. In a letter to his wife, Yeats expressed his wish to be buried in a cemetery in Roquebrune for one year and then to be exhumed and reburied in Drumcliff, County Sligo, Ireland. However, his exhumation was delayed until September 1948 at which point they could no longer locate his remains. According to one account, the French diplomat sent to oversee the reburial, Bernard Cailloux, said that it was &quot;impossible to return the full and authentic remains of Mr Yeats&quot; and proposed asking Dr Rebouillat, the local sworn pathologist, &quot;to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased&quot;. The remains of several other individuals, including an Englishman named Alfred Hollis, were assembled in a coffin and sent to Ireland for reburial. The entire affair was handled with secrecy on both the part of the French delegation responsible for the burial, and the poet&#x27;s family, so as not to elicit outrage from the Irish public. The incident was not publicly disclosed until the private archives of French diplomat Jacques Camílle Paris were turned over to the Irish Embassy in Paris in June 2015. The story was older than that, and was disputed by the family of the poet in a letter to The Irish Times in 1988.

The literary couple Romain Gary and Lesley Blanch lived in Roquebrune from 1950 to 1957.
Le Corbusier built a cabanon, a minimalist architectural design. He drowned in the sea there on 27 August 1965 and was buried in the local cemetery.

==Today==

Roquebrune-Cap-Martin has several villages and towns: St. Roman, practically a suburb of Monaco (but not part of Monaco proper, as it does not lie within the borders of Monaco), the residential areas of Cabbé, Bon Voyage and Serret, Roquebrune with its perched village and château, the posh Cap Martin peninsula and the modern seaside resort of Carnolès, with its long pebble beach bordering Menton.

The whole area has a major tourism industry, particularly during the high season from April to October.

==Demographics==
==Culture==
The local dialect actually is linguistically part of the Mentonasque of the &quot;País Mentonasc&quot;, a cultural area between the Ligurian dialects and the Occitan language.

Since 1861 the use of the French language has increased enormously in the city, and now only a minority of the 12,966 inhabitants still speak the original dialect of &quot;Roccabruna&quot;.

==Sport==
Despite its name, the Monte Carlo Country Club is located in the commune and not in Monte Carlo, Monaco. It is the venue for the tennis Monte-Carlo Masters.

==International relations==
Roquebrune-Cap-Martin is twinned with:
* Profondeville, Belgium
* Vejle, Denmark

==Honorary citizens==
People awarded the honorary citizenship of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin are:

<text>Henry Boardman Conover (January 18, 1892 – May 5, 1950) was an American soldier, salesman, and amateur ornithologist.

Conover was born in Chicago, the son of Charles Hopkins Conover and his wife Delia Louise Boardman. He attended The Hill School and then studied at the Sheffield Scientific School in Yale. He had an interest in natural history from an early age, and collected bird specimens. In 1920, he traveled to Venezuela with Wilfred Hudson Osgood on a collecting trip for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The trip inspired him to leave business and devote himself to ornithology, and they returned to South America in 1922, visiting Chile and Argentina. In 1926, Conover traveled to East Africa. Conover became, successively, an associate in ornithology, a life member in 1924, a patron in 1926, a contributor in 1930, a research associate in birds 1936, a trustee and corporate member in 1940, and a benefactor of the Field Museum in 1950.

Conover donated his collection of specimens, mostly game birds, to the Field Museum. It comprised 18,000, specimens including 30 types. He made a large number of contributions to Carl Eduard Hellmayr&#x27;s &quot;The Catalogue of Birds of the Americas&quot;.

Conover was a member of the advisory council of Peabody Museum of Natural History, a trustee of the Chicago Zoological Society, and a fellow of the American Ornithologists Union.

He died, unmarried, in Chicago, of cardiac failure, and was buried in Graceland Cemetery.

<text>Brough Superior ( ) motorcycles, sidecars, and motor cars were made by George Brough in his Brough Superior works on Haydn Road in Nottingham, England, from 1919 to 1940. The motorcycles were dubbed the &quot;Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles&quot; by H. D. Teague of &quot;The Motor Cycle&quot; newspaper. Approximately 3048 motorcycles (19 models) were made in the 21 years of production; around a third of that production still exists. T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) owned eight of these motorcycles and died from injuries sustained when he crashed number seven; the eighth was on order. Moving forward to 2008, vintage motorcycle enthusiast Mark Upham acquired the rights to the Brough Superior name. In 2013 he met motorcycle designer Thierry Henriette and asked him to design a new Brough Superior motorcycle. Three months later a prototype of a new SS100 was shown in Milan.

==History==
George Brough was a racer, designer, and showman - his father William E. Brough had been making Brough Motorcycles in Nottingham since 1908, and continued to do so until 1926. Convinced he could improve on his father&#x27;s designs, all Brough Superior motorcycles were high performance and superior quality. Most were custom-built to the customer&#x27;s needs, and rarely were any two of the same configuration.

Each motorcycle was assembled twice. The first assembly was to fit all the components. Then the motorcycle was disassembled and all the parts painted or plated as needed. Finally, the finished parts were assembled a second time. Every motorcycle was test ridden to ensure that it performed to specification, and was personally certified by George Brough. The SS100 model was ridden at or more before delivery. The SS80 model was ridden at or more before delivery. If any motorcycle did not meet specification, it was returned to the works for rework until it performed properly. The fit and finish was comparable to a Rolls-Royce car, and they were the most expensive road-going motorcycles in the world.

Brough Superior motorcycles have always been rare and expensive. Prices for these motorcycles ranged from £100 to £185 in the 1920s and 1930s. Since the average annual salary in Britain during the 1930s was £200, only the wealthy could afford them.

In 1940, World War II brought an end to production as the factory was engaged on war work, completing crankshafts for Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. After hostilities had ceased there were no suitable engines available so the company was wound up. In 2004, around 1,000 Brough Superior motorcycles still existed.

==Brough Superior motorcycles==
Early models include the Brough Superior Mark I Sidevalve, Mark I Overhead, Mark II Standard and Mark II Sports. Early to mid manufacture included the Overhead 500, 680 S.V. Junior, and 750 Side Valve, but these were not popular and were dropped from production.

The following four models represent the bulk of manufacture. Most were custom built to order and many variations were made:
* The SS100 (Super Sports), powered by J.A.P. (J. A. Prestwich of Tottenham) or Matchless 1000 cc overhead valve V-twin engines. Approximately 383 were manufactured from 1924 to 1940.
* The SS80 (Super Sports), powered by J.A.P. or Matchless 1,000 cc sidevalve V-twin engines. Approximately 1,086 were manufactured from 1922 to 1940.
* The 680 O.H.V., powered by J.A.P. 680 cc overhead valve V-twin. Approximately 547 were manufactured from 1926 to 1936.
* The 11.50, powered by J.A.P 1096 cc sidevalve 60° V-twin engines. These were primarily designed for sidecar and police use. Approximately 308 were manufactured from 1933 to 1940. The model name refers to the horsepower rating of the engine, 11 RAC (Royal Automobile Club), . In reality these engines produced under 30 bhp (under 22 kW). Tax horsepower ratings were required by manufactures for tax purposes. RAC HP equals the piston diameter squared times the number of cylinders divided by 2.5.

Brough Superior produced many other experimental, show, and racing models. These include:
*Golden Dream. This was powered by a vertically stacked twin crankshaft opposed four cylinder engine. George Brough called this a &quot;flat vertical&quot; engine, which used a shaft final drive. The bike was finished in gold paint for the London Motorcycle Show. It was unveiled at the motorcycle show at Earls Court in 1938.
*Brough Superior Austin Four or BS4. This bike was powered by a modified Austin 7 automobile engine and transmission. As the prop-shaft of the automotive transmission emerged in the center of the motorcycle&#x27;s driveline, George Brough used two rear wheels mounted to a central, cast final drive unit. As the rear wheels were within 24&quot; of each other, the Brough Superior 3-wheeler was legally considered a &#x27;motorcycle&#x27; in the UK. It remains the only motorcycle in history to use this configuration. The Brough-Austin Four was intended for sidecar use, although one was ordered without a sidecar by journalist Hubert Chantry, who had borrowed a factory show model for use in the Land&#x27;s End Trial of 1932. 10 examples were built.
*Pendine. This was introduced in 1927 and had a guaranteed top speed of . They were based on the SS100 model but with higher performance modifications to the engine. A well known racer, Barry Baragwanath, installed a supercharger on one, and it is now known as &quot;Barry&#x27;s Big Blown Brough&quot;. Noel Pope bought the motorcycle and in 1939 set two lap records with it at Brooklands; with sidecar, and in solo configuration, which exceeded the previous record set in 1935 by Eric Fernihough also on a Brough Superior. These records still stand as the track closed in 1939.

George Brough was known for his dedication to his vehicles and customers. He, and later Albert Wallis, continued to service Brough Superiors after production ceased, making parts until 1969. To all intents and purposes production of bikes never resumed after WWII.

In 2013 Brough Superior said it would return to Grand Prix motorcycle racing with a prototype machine for Moto2, the Carbon2, a motorcycle made by California builders Taylormade and rebranded as a Brough Superior.

==Brough Superior sidecars==
Brough Superior also manufactured sidecars. The sidecars had coach-built bodies, and some carried a spare tyre, while others offered two seats for occasional use. The fit and finish of these sidecars were of the highest standard, as were the motorcycles. These sidecars all offered good protection from the elements. Many of the earlier sidecars were built to Brough Superior specification, while later sidecar frames were manufactured in the Brough Superior factory. Later sidecars were unique in the fact that the frame of the sidecar held fuel. The sidecar frame looped over the top of the sidecar body and had a filler cap at the topmost position. Fuel was pressurized by a hand pump that transferred fuel from the sidecar to the petrol tank on the motorcycle. Two different bodies could be ordered for the petrol tube sidecar; cruiser or sports.
The various sidecars were offered in the yearly Brough Superior sales catalogs:
*1921: &quot;Sporting Sidecar&quot; manufactured by Montgomery Sidecars to Brough Superior Specifications.
*1922: &quot;Sidecar&quot; registered to the design of the manufacturer.
*1923: &quot;Brough Superior Sidecar&quot; registered to the design of the manufacturer.
*1924: &quot;Brough Superior Sidecar&quot;, &quot;Brough Superior Swallow Coupe&quot;, &quot;Brough Superior Sporting&quot;, &quot;Brough Superior Sporting Tourist&quot;.
*1925: &quot;Brough Superior Sporting Sidecar&quot;, &quot;Brough Superior Touring Sidecar&quot;.
*1926: &quot;Brough Superior Super Sports Sidecar&quot;, and made mention of other sidecars available.
*1927: &quot;Brough Superior Touring Sports&quot; was mentioned in the 1928 catalog mentions the popularity of it in 1927. No mention of sidecars were in the 1927 catalog.
*1928: &quot;Brough Superior Touring Sports&quot;, &quot;Brough Superior Cruiser&quot; are listed.
*1929: &quot;Brough Superior Spring Frame Cruiser&quot; Sidecar is introduced with reference to many other sidecars available.

==Brough Superior cars==
George Brough made approximately 85 cars named Brough Superior. Built between 1935 and 1939, they were powered by Hudson engines and had a Hudson chassis. Three models were made, but only two reached production. Early cars did not carry Brough Superior badges as Brough thought the cars sufficiently distinctive in themselves.

The first car was the 4 litre made from May 1935 to 1936 using a , 4,168 cc side valve, straight-eight engine. Performance was remarkable for the time with a top speed of and a 0- time of under 10 seconds. Only a four-seat drop head was available with coachwork by W.C Atcherley of Birmingham. 19 were made and nine are known to have survived. This Brough designed, Atcherly coachwork of classic lines has steel guards, aluminium body over ash frame and is handsome, strong and durable. Unrestored examples are still roadworthy over 80 years later.

Hudson Canada stopped supplying the eight-cylinder engine and chassis kits in 1936, and subsequent cars had a , 3,455 cc straight-six, still with side valves and called the 3.5 litre. A Centric supercharged version was also listed with a claimed output of . The chassis was shorter than the 4 litre at 116 inches. Saloon bodies were available but most were open cars. Approximately 80 were made between 1936 and 1939.

The final car, the XII made in 1938, used a Lincoln-Zephyr V12 engine of 4,387 cc and Brough&#x27;s own design of chassis with Girling brakes and Ford axles. Only one was made with a saloon body built by Charlesworth. A large car with an overall length of and width of , it still survives.

Journalist Bill Boddy tested an early model Brough Superior Saloon in 1936 for &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine. Noting the car had a reserve fuel tank, he declined to fill up before the journey. Upon running out of petrol, he could not find the switch to activate the reserve. After begging petrol from a passing lorry Boddy then encountered a motorcyclist who had crashed, and offered to help. When asked, he told Boddy that his bike was a Brough Superior and asked what was, &quot;...the nice car in which you are giving me a lift.&quot; When told it was a Brough Superior the motorcyclist was silent for the rest of the journey. Boddy presumed this was incredulity that a famed motorcycle maker could also manufacture cars, and supposed that the motorcyclist presumed he was concussed.

==Etymology==
The Brough surname, as with many English surnames that look like placenames, probably arose because one of George Brough&#x27;s male-line ancestors came from one of several places in Britain so called. It is originally a form of the word &quot;borough&quot;. &quot;Superior&quot; was a claim by George Brough of his bike&#x27;s superiority over all other motorcycles, including the original Brough Motorcycles manufactured by his father, William E. Brough.

==Revival==
The Brough Superior make and name was purchased by a Jersey-registered corporation, operated by Mark Upham. He quickly asked Thierry Henriette to operate the development of new Brough Superior Motorcycles. Thierry Henriette, CEO of the French design company Boxer Design is now the owner of the Brough Superior Factory. He financed and operated the development of a new SS100 in respect to the original ethos of the Brough Superior marque - innovation, excellent design, and superior construction and materials. The new Boxer-designed Brough Superior SS100 first appeared at the EICMA show in Milan in 2013; serial production began in 2016.

The new Brough Superior SS100 features an 88degree, 990cc v-twin engine, with water cooling and DOHC four-valve cylinder heads, designed and built by Boxer Design. The engine produces 120 hp in standard tune, and the chassis uses the engine as a stressed member, with a Fior-based front fork with Öhlins shock absorber, with Öhlins monoshock rear suspension. The chassis is made entirely of exotic materials, including titanium, carbon fiber, and aluminum. The front brakes are from Beringer, with four rotors, sourced from the aircraft industry. The minimal bodywork is constructed of hand-hammered aluminum, including the fuel tank, seat cowl, fenders, and side covers. The dry weight of the SS100 is just under 400 lbs, making it among the lightest &#x27;litre bikes&#x27; ever produced for street use.

Press reaction to the new SS100 has been generally positive. Road tests have praised the smooth engine, excellent handling, and contemporary performance, with some journalist praising the overall design aesthetic.

In 2017, Brough Superior presented a new model at the EICMA fair in Milan: the &quot;Pendine Sand Racer&quot;. Reminiscing the times when Brough Superior competed on the sand beaches of Wales, the &quot;Pendine Sand Racer&quot; is a variation of the S.S.100 with a flat track style and higher exhausts and handlebar.

In 2019, to commemorate Brough Superior&#x27;s centenary, the company launched the &quot;Anniversary&quot; model. Limited to 100 editions. The model is a success for Brough Superior&#x27;s enthusiasts.

In November the same year, Brough Superior announced its partnership with Aston Martin to the World at the EICMA fair. Both brands gathered to present the AMB 001 (for Aston Martin Brough). Presented in the traditional Aston Martin Racing colours of Stirling Green and Lime Essence with Matte Black wheels, fork and brake assemblies, the AMB 001 features a combination of paint and bare carbon fibre. The AMB 001 boasts a turbo-charged output of 180 hp (134 kW) at just dry weight. This turbo configuration is claimed to bring an engine response with huge torque in a wide range of engine rpm.

<text>USS &quot;Pintado&quot; (SS-387/AGSS-387), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pintado.
==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pintado&quot; was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 7 May 1943; launched on 15 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Antonio Prince; and commissioned on 1 January 1944, Lieutenant Commander Bernard A. Clarey in command.

==Operational history==
&quot;Pintado&quot; departed Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 17 February 1944 for torpedo trials at Newport, training from Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut, and antisubmarine warfare tactics and experiments with torpedo developments from Key West, Florida. She sailed for the Pacific Ocean on 31 March 1944, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 23 April 1944.

===World War II===
====First patrol, May – July 1944====
On her first war patrol, &quot;Pintado&quot; was the flagship of a wolfpack, commanded by Captain Leon N. Blair, which also included submarines and . The attack group departed Pearl Harbor 16 May, touched at Midway 20 May – 21 May, and headed for waters west of the Marianas and south of Formosa. On 31 May, they formed a scouting line in search of a convoy reported by submarine .

After sparring with the convoy&#x27;s escorts through the night, &quot;Pintado&quot; managed to reach attack position shortly before dawn and fired a spread of six torpedoes at overlapping targets, destroying the 4,716 ton cargo ship &quot;Toho Maru&quot;. She then daringly came within of an escort while bringing her stern tubes to bear on another merchant ship. Although explosions suggested that some of the second spread of torpedoes had scored, no second sinking has been confirmed. &quot;Pintado&quot; then skillfully evaded angry Japanese destroyers and sped away to safety.

About midday on 4 June, &quot;Pintado&quot; sighted smoke from a Japanese convoy heading toward Saipan. She and her sister subs headed for the enemy, and soon &quot;Shark&quot; sank 6,886-ton cargo ship &quot;Katsunkawa Maru&quot; before escaping from a heavy depth charge attack. The American submarines continued to shadow the convoy and early the next day &quot;Shark&quot;&#x27;s torpedoes accounted for two more cargo ships.

&quot;Pintado&quot; made her kills shortly before noon of 6 June, D-Day in Normandy, with a spread of torpedoes at overlapping targets. An awesome explosion tore one ship apart, her bow and stern both projecting up in the air as she sank. The stern of a second was under water before she was swallowed by smoke and flame. These victims were later identified as 5,652-ton &quot;Havre Maru&quot; and 2,825-ton &quot;Kashimasan Maru&quot;. An airplane and five escorts tried to box in the submarine and dropped over 50 depth charges, but she escaped damage.

&quot;Pintado&quot; and her sisters in the wolfpack had all but destroyed the convoy which was attempting to reinforce Japanese defenses of the Marianas. While escorts rescued many of the 7,000 troops whose ships had gone down, they had lost weapons, tanks, and equipment. This greatly weakened Japan&#x27;s defensive capability in the Marianas for the impending American invasion of Saipan. Pintado then headed for the Marshall Islands, arriving Majuro 1 July for refit.

====Second patrol, July – September 1944====
Her second war patrol took the submarine to the East China Sea. On 6 August she sank 5,401-ton cargoship &quot;Shonan Maru&quot; and damaged another target in a Formosa-bound convoy, before escaping through a barrage of exploding depth charges. On 22 August &quot;Pintado&quot; spotted an 11-ship convoy guarded by three escorts. After dark she moved into the center of the convoy, passing a scant from an escort, to attack &quot;Tonan Maru No. 2&quot;, a former whale factory which Lt. Comdr. Clarey, as executive officer of , had helped to sink in Kavieng Harbor, Bismarck Archipelago, 10 October 1942. Since then, the Japanese had raised the ship and towed her to Japan where she was repaired and converted to a tanker.

Two spreads of torpedoes from the submarine left the ship ablaze and sinking and damaged two other tankers. At 19,262 tons, &quot;Tonan Maru No. 2&quot; was one of the largest merchant ships sunk by an American submarine in World War II. Following lifeguard station duty off Japan, &quot;Pintado&quot; turned eastward 1 September and arrived Pearl Harbor on 14 September.

====Third patrol, October 1944 – January 1945====
On &quot;Pintado&quot;&#x27;s third war patrol, Lt. Comdr. Clarey commanded a wolfpack which included and . The group departed Pearl Harbor 9 October heading for the South China Sea. Meanwhile, General Douglas MacArthur was preparing to return to the Philippines. When his troops landed on Leyte 20 October, the Japanese Navy struck back with all its force in a &quot;go for broke&quot; attempt to smash the invasion. The result was the Battle for Leyte Gulf.

As the Americans turned back the Japanese offensive, Clarey&#x27;s submarines sped toward Luzon Strait to attack the Northern Japanese Force which Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet had engaged off Cape Engaño. On the night of 25 October, &quot;Jallao&quot; made radar contact with bomb-damaged light cruiser fleeing from Halsey. &quot;Pintado&quot; closed the scene with &quot;Jallao&quot; but held her fire while her sister submarine attacked, ready to join in if needed. &quot;Jallao&quot; launched seven torpedoes, and &quot;Tama&quot; broke up and sank, the last cruiser to go down in the Battle off Cape Engaño.

A bonus came on 3 November when &quot;Pintado&quot;&#x27;s periscope revealed &quot;the largest enemy ship we have ever seen&quot;, apparently an oiler in the support group for the Japanese carriers. Clarey fired six bow torpedoes at the huge target, but enemy destroyer deliberately crossed their path to intercept the torpedoes before they could reach their target. The destroyer disintegrated in a tremendous explosion which provided an effective smoke screen protecting the original target until the two remaining Japanese escorts forced the submarine to dive and withdraw to escape exploding depth charges.

&quot;Pintado&quot; joined on 14 November and escorted the damaged submarine to Saipan, arriving Tanapag Harbor five days later. After a week in port, she resumed her war patrol south of Takao. On the night of 12 December – 13 December, she sank two enemy landing craft, &quot;Transport No. 12&quot; and &quot;Transport No. 104&quot;, and claimed she had sunk a third, &quot;Transport No. 106&quot;, but apparently missed. Two days later she headed for Australia and arrived Brisbane on New Year&#x27;s Day 1945. She won the Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary skill and heroism on her first three war patrols.

====Fourth–sixth patrols, January – August 1945====
The veteran submarine departed Brisbane 27 January but found no targets as she patrolled the Singapore-Saigon shipping lanes. Throughout the patrol, she played hide and go seek with Japanese aircraft and, on 20 February, barely escaped when a plane appeared from the clouds and dropped two depth charges which jarred the submarine. She made temporary repairs and continued to patrol until returning to Fremantle 30 March.

&quot;Pintado&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor before getting underway 1 June for her fifth war patrol on lifeguard station for bomber raids on Tokyo. On 26 June, just south of Honshū, a smoking B-29 bomber, the &quot;City of Galveston&quot;, crossed her bow at about , dropped a dozen parachutes, crashed into the sea and exploded. In less than an hour the submarine had rescued the entire crew which she took to Guam, arriving Apra Harbor a fortnight later. Color Footage of that video can be found at The Museum of Flight 

The submarine departed Guam 7 August for her sixth and last war patrol, and took station off Tokyo Bay until hearing that hostilities had ended on 15 August. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 August and reached San Francisco 5 September. She remained there until decommissioning 6 March 1946.

===Postwar===
While in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, &quot;Pintado&quot; was reclassified AGSS-387 on 1 December 1962. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 March 1967 and sold for scrapping to Zidell Explorations, Inc., Portland, Oregon, 20 January 1969.

During the war, &quot;Pintado&quot; was credited with sinking 13 ships of 98,600 tons, and damaging two additional vessels, one a 28,000 ton aircraft carrier to score a total of 34,300 tons. Postwar, this was reduced to eight ships for 42,963 tons by the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee.

Her conning tower is on display at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas.

<text>The Piton des Neiges (Snow Peak) is a shield volcano on Réunion, one of the French volcanic islands in the Mascarene Archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean. It is located about east of Madagascar. Piton des Neiges is the highest point on Réunion and is considered to be the highest point in the Indian Ocean.

== History and geology ==
Piton des Neiges was formed by the Réunion hotspot and emerged from the sea about two million years ago. The volcano has been inactive for 20,000 years. Réunion itself is considered to be about three million years old; the other two islands in the archipelago, Mauritius and Rodrigues, are 7.8 million and 1.5 million years old, respectively.

The Piton des Neiges forms the northwestern two-thirds of Réunion, with the very active Piton de la Fournaise comprising the rest. Additionally, it is surrounded by three massive crater valleys. As its name suggests, snow is occasionally seen on its summit in winter. The Piton des Neiges is ranked 14th in the world by topographic isolation.

The island possesses a high endemism of flowering plants (about 225); this has justified the creation of a biological reserve on the lower slopes of the Piton des Neiges.

==Hiking==
Three tracks lead up to the peak: one from the Cirque de Salazie, another from the Cirque de Cilaos, and the third from Plaine des Cafres. They meet at a staffed mountain hut about an hour&#x27;s walk below the peak. 

The hike starting from Cilaos spans 8.9 miles, typically taking an average of 8.5 hours to complete. Although this is feasible in a single day, most hikers prefer to stay overnight at the mountain hut, Gîte de la Caverne Dufour. This hike is considered challenging due to the elevation gain.

The hike starting from la Plaine des Cafres is much longer, at 19.6 miles, and a similar elevation gain of .

<doc id="1205989" wikidata="Q7576696" url="?curid=1205989" title="Spherical 3-manifold">
<text>In mathematics, a spherical 3-manifold &quot;M&quot; is a 3-manifold of the form
:formula_1
where formula_2 is a finite subgroup of O(4) acting freely by rotations on the 3-sphere formula_3. All such manifolds are prime, orientable, and closed. Spherical 3-manifolds are sometimes called elliptic 3-manifolds.

==Properties==
A special case of the Bonnet–Myers theorem says that every smooth manifold which has a smooth Riemannian metric which is both geodesically complete and of constant positive curvature must be closed and have finite fundamental group. William Thurston&#x27;s elliptization conjecture, proven by Grigori Perelman using Richard Hamilton&#x27;s Ricci flow, states a converse: every closed three-dimensional manifold with finite fundamental group has a smooth Riemannian metric of constant positive curvature. (This converse is special to three dimensions.) As such, the spherical three-manifolds are precisely the closed 3-manifolds with finite fundamental group.

According to Synge&#x27;s theorem, every spherical 3-manifold is orientable, and in particular formula_2 must be included in SO(4). The fundamental group is either cyclic, or is a central extension of a dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral group by a cyclic group of even order. This divides the set of such manifolds into five classes, described in the following sections.

The spherical manifolds are exactly the manifolds with spherical geometry, one of the eight geometries of Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture.

==Cyclic case (lens spaces)==

The manifolds formula_5 with Γ cyclic are precisely the 3-dimensional lens spaces. A lens space is not determined by its fundamental group (there are non-homeomorphic lens spaces with isomorphic fundamental groups); but any other spherical manifold is.

Three-dimensional lens spaces arise as quotients of formula_6 by
the action of the group that is generated by elements of the form

: formula_7

where formula_8. Such a lens space formula_9 has fundamental group formula_10 for all formula_11, so spaces with different formula_12 are not homotopy equivalent. 
Moreover, classifications up to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence are known, as follows. The three-dimensional spaces formula_13 and
formula_14 are:
#homotopy equivalent if and only if formula_15 for some formula_16
#homeomorphic if and only if formula_17

In particular, the lens spaces &quot;L&quot;(7,1) and &quot;L&quot;(7,2) give examples of two 3-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic.

The lens space &quot;L&quot;(1,0) is the 3-sphere, and the lens space &quot;L&quot;(2,1) is 3 dimensional real projective space.

Lens spaces can be represented as Seifert fiber spaces in many ways, usually as fiber spaces over the 2-sphere with at most two exceptional fibers, though the lens space with fundamental group of order 4 also has a representation as a Seifert fiber space over the projective plane with no exceptional fibers.

==Dihedral case (prism manifolds)==
A prism manifold is a closed 3-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; whose fundamental group
is a central extension of a dihedral group.

The fundamental group π1(&quot;M&quot;) of &quot;M&quot; is a product of a cyclic group of order &quot;m&quot; with a group having presentation

:formula_18

for integers &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; with &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, &quot;m&quot; ≥ 1, &quot;n&quot;
≥ 2 and &quot;m&quot; coprime to 2&quot;n&quot;.

Alternatively, the fundamental group has presentation

:formula_19

for coprime integers &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; with &quot;m&quot; ≥ 1, &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2. (The &quot;n&quot; here equals the previous &quot;n&quot;, and the &quot;m&quot; here is 2&quot;k&quot;-1 times the previous &quot;m&quot;.)

We continue with the latter presentation. This group is a metacyclic group of order 4&quot;mn&quot; with abelianization of order 4&quot;m&quot; (so &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are both determined by this group).
The element &quot;y&quot; generates a cyclic normal subgroup of order 2&quot;n&quot;, and the element &quot;x&quot; has order 4&quot;m&quot;. The center is cyclic of order 2&quot;m&quot; and is generated by &quot;x&quot;2, and the quotient by the center is the dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot;.

When &quot;m&quot; = 1 this group is a binary dihedral or dicyclic group. The simplest example is &quot;m&quot; = 1, &quot;n&quot; = 2, when π1(&quot;M&quot;) is the quaternion group of order 8.

Prism manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups: if a closed 3-manifold has the same fundamental group as a prism manifold &quot;M&quot;, it is homeomorphic to &quot;M&quot;.

Prism manifolds can be represented as Seifert fiber spaces in two ways.

==Tetrahedral case==
The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order &quot;m&quot; with a group having presentation

:formula_20

for integers &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot; with &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, &quot;m&quot; ≥ 1 and &quot;m&quot; coprime to 6.

Alternatively, the fundamental group has presentation

for an odd integer &quot;m&quot; ≥ 1. (The &quot;m&quot; here is 3&quot;k&quot;-1 times the previous &quot;m&quot;.)

We continue with the latter presentation. This group has order 24&quot;m&quot;. The elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; generate a normal subgroup isomorphic to the quaternion group of order 8. The center is cyclic of order 2&quot;m&quot;. It is generated by the elements &quot;z&quot;3 and &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;y&quot;2, and the quotient by the center is the tetrahedral group, equivalently, the alternating group &quot;A&quot;4.

When &quot;m&quot; = 1 this group is the binary tetrahedral group.

These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces: the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 3.

==Octahedral case==
The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order &quot;m&quot; coprime to 6 with the binary octahedral group (of order 48) which has the presentation

<text>Donna McKechnie (born November 16, 1942) is an American musical theater dancer, singer, actress, and choreographer. She is known for her professional and personal relationship with choreographer Michael Bennett, with whom she collaborated on her most noted role, the character of Cassie in the musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. She earned the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for this performance in 1976. She is also known for playing Amanda Harris/Olivia Corey on the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; from 1969 to 1970.

== Early life ==
McKechnie was born in 1942 in Pontiac, Michigan, the daughter of Donald Bruce McKechnie and Carolyn Ruth Johnson. She began ballet classes at age five. Her earliest influence was the classic British ballet film &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948), which prompted her, at age eight, to plan a career as a ballerina. She studied for many years at the Rose Marie Floyd School of Dance in Royal Oak. Despite her parents&#x27; strong misgivings, she moved to New York City when she was 17. Rejected after an audition for the American Ballet Theatre, she found employment in the corps de ballet at Radio City Music Hall but walked off the job on the day of dress rehearsal to do summer stock at the Carousel Theatre in Framingham, Massachusetts. She studied theatre at HB Studio in New York City.

After doing a Welch&#x27;s Grape Juice commercial and the first L&#x27;eggs stockings commercial, she was cast in a touring company of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. In 1961, she made her Broadway debut in &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, where she met choreographer Bob Fosse and his wife, Gwen Verdon. A stint in a Philadelphia production of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (as Philia) was followed by the NBC music series &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, on which she was a featured dancer. While working on &quot;Hullabaloo,&quot; she met Michael Bennett, who became her husband and a guiding force in her life and career.

She also appeared as Philia in the national tour of &quot;Forum&quot;, starring Jerry Lester (Pseudolus), with Paul Hartman (Senex), Erik Rhodes (Marcus Lycus), Arnold Stang (Hysterium) and Edward Everett Horton (Erronius), produced by Martin Tahse.

==Broadway==
In April, 1968, McKechnie was back on Broadway in the short-lived musical version of Leo Rosten&#x27;s collection of short stories &quot;The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot;, which led to a featured role in Burt Bacharach and Hal David&#x27;s &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, choreographed by Bennett. Along with Baayork Lee and Margo Sappington, she danced in one of Broadway&#x27;s most famous numbers, &quot;Turkey Lurkey Time&quot;, which was when she first began to attract notice from critics and theatergoers alike. This was followed by a role in the touring company of &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, starring Ethel Merman.

Bennett showcased McKechnie again in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot; (1970), where she danced &quot;Tick-Tock.&quot; After leaving the Broadway cast, she reprised her role in the Los Angeles and London companies, and also toured in the 1971 revival of &quot;On the Town&quot; as Ivy. In March 1973, she choreographed and performed in the highly acclaimed one-night-only concert &quot;Sondheim: A Musical Tribute&quot; at the Shubert Theatre in New York. Later that year, McKechnie starred in a production of at the Wayside Theatre in Middletown, Virginia. In 1974, she co-starred with Richard Kiley and Bob Fosse in the unsuccessful musical film version of the classic &quot;The Little Prince&quot;.

McKechnie was part of Bennett&#x27;s group therapy-style workshops that evolved into the Broadway smash &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, in which she portrayed Cassie, a character based in large part on herself. She danced her third famous Bennett-McKechnie number, &quot;The Music and the Mirror&quot;, in which the vocal sections were tailored to her unusually wide range. Initially, Donna was to perform the number with four of her male co-stars; however, four previews before opening, McKechnie voiced concern about dancing around the four men, and at the last moment, Bennett changed the direction to have McKechnie perform the song-dance number alone. Her performance earned her the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The role of Maggie was also based on her life. She married Bennett in 1976, but after only a few months they separated and eventually divorced, although they remained good friends until his death from AIDS in 1987.

In 1980, McKechnie was diagnosed with arthritis and told she never would dance again. She went on to choreograph NFL&#x27;s Football&#x27;s Fabulous Females, The Los Angeles Raiderettes in 1983 as they made their debut in L.A. The same year, in season 2 of the TV show &quot;Family Ties&quot;, she played Cynthia, a divorcee who planned to move west with her young son away from his father. McKechnie pursued various physical, psychological, and holistic healing remedies, and was well enough to return to the Broadway company of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; in 1986. Later in the 1980s, she toured in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; and &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, and she appeared in a London revival of &quot;Can-Can&quot;. She also participated in the &quot;Chorus Line&quot; extravaganza to celebrate its then record-breaking run on Broadway in September 1983.

On March 5, 2024, McKechnie joined the Broadway cast of &quot;Wicked&quot;, playing Madame Morrible.

==Later career==
Her television work included a regular role on the Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; early in her career. After her rise to fame, she made guest appearances on Scarecrow and Mrs. King (whose female lead, Kate Jackson, was also a Dark Shadows alumna), Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh In, and &quot;Cheers&quot; (as Debra, the ex-wife of Sam Malone). She played Suzi Laird on several episodes of &quot;Fame&quot;.

In the early 1990s, McKechnie appeared off-Broadway twice, first in a revue entitled &quot;Cut the Ribbons&quot;, followed by &quot;Annie Warbucks&quot;, a less successful sequel to the hit &quot;Annie&quot;. In 1993, she reunited with most of the original cast of &quot;Company&quot; for three concert performances. In 1996, she was awarded the Fred Astaire Award for Best Female Dancer for her performance in a Broadway adaptation of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s film &quot;State Fair&quot;. In the same year, she was in a production of &quot;You Never Know&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse. In February, 1997, she played Phyllis in a concert performance of &quot;Follies&quot; at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre, and the following year took on the role of Sally in a production of that same show at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. McKechnie also starred opposite Carol Lawrence in the Los Angeles and New York production of Joni Fritz&#x27;s &quot;Girl&#x27;s Room&quot;, produced by Dennis Grimaldi and directed and choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett, both former Michael Bennett dancers.

In 2001, McKechnie created the role of Lela Rogers, mother of Ginger Rogers, in the world premiere of &quot;Ginger: The Musical&quot;.

In 2002, McKechnie starred in the pre-Broadway production of the Jerry Herman musical revue &quot;Showtune&quot;. In recent years, she has toured periodically in her one-woman show &quot;Inside the Music&quot;, a potpourri of songs, dances and anecdotes about her life in the theater and her successful battle with arthritis, directed by her old &quot;Chorus Line&quot; castmate, Thommie Walsh.

Her autobiography, &quot;Time Steps: My Musical Comedy Life&quot;, written with Greg Lawrence, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster on August 29, 2006, only weeks before the Broadway revival of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; opened on October 5.

In June 2010, McKechnie appeared at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival.

McKechnie was on the faculty of HB Studio in New York City. In 2015, she served as the standby for Chita Rivera in Kander and Ebb&#x27;s musical &quot;The Visit&quot; on Broadway, but never went on.

In the fall of 2017, McKechnie appeared as Mabel in &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; produced by Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="1205993" wikidata="Q392563" url="?curid=1205993" title="Agenda 2010">
<text>The Agenda 2010 is a series of reforms planned and executed by the German government in the early 2000s, a Social Democrats/Greens coalition at that time, which aimed to reform the German welfare system and labour relations. The declared objective of Agenda 2010 was to promote economic growth and thus reduce unemployment.

==Overview==
On 14 March 2003, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder gave a speech before the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; outlining the proposed plans for reform. He pointed out three main areas which the agenda would focus on: the economy, the system of social security, and Germany&#x27;s position on the world market.

German finance minister Hans Eichel had the responsibility of implementing socially unpopular measures including tax cuts (such as a 25% reduction in the basic rate of income tax), cuts in the cost absorption for medical treatment and drastic cuts in pension benefits, and cuts in unemployment benefits. The measures were ostensibly proposed in accordance with the market liberalisation approach adopted by the EU&#x27;s Lisbon Strategy. The name &quot;Agenda 2010&quot; itself is a reference to the Lisbon Strategy&#x27;s 2010 deadline.

The plan was strongly promoted by the Bertelsmann media group.

A series of changes in the labour market known as the Hartz plan started in 2003 and the last step, Hartz IV, came into effect on 1 January 2005. These changes affected unemployment benefits and job centers in Germany, and the very nature of the German system of social security.

==Reactions==

Politicians, industrial leaders, trade unions, media and population consider the Agenda 2010, especially the Hartz IV law, as the largest cut into the German system of social security since World War II.

While industrial leaders and both the conservative and economically liberal parliamentary parties such as the CDU, the CSU, and the FDP strongly supported Agenda 2010 as it implemented their long-time demands, there was a strong upheaval in Schröder&#x27;s own SPD. After Schröder threatened to resign (with no obvious successor as Chancellor) if the changes were blocked within his party, since they were so vital to his government&#x27;s policy, he received an inner-party 80% vote of confidence as well as a 90% approval from his coalition partner, the Greens.

The leaders of the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches in Germany took the &quot;highly unusual step&quot; of publicly expressing their support for the government&#x27;s proposals. &quot;The old methods no longer work&quot;, the chairman of the Evangelical church, Manfred Kock, said. The leader of the country&#x27;s Catholics, Cardinal Karl Lehman, called Schröder&#x27;s proposals &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;.

Schröder had won the 2002 federal election with, among other things, the promise not to cut into the social security system. In reaction to the Agenda&#x27;s policies and the measures taken, a significant number of members of Schröder&#x27;s SPD left the party, but the more prominent left-wing politicians stayed on. Although the changes eventually went through, Gerhard Schröder, after adverse opinion polls, resigned as party chairman (though not as Chancellor) in February 2004, to give way to Franz Müntefering.

This development left the PDS (with only 2 out of the 603 members of the federal parliament) as the only outspoken opponent to the Agenda 2010 policies although their course was somewhat inconsistent. In the &quot;Länder&quot; of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Berlin, where there are SPD-PDS coalitions (and later SPD-Die Linke coalitions), PDS/Die Linke ministers actively implemented &quot;Agenda 2010&quot; laws.

The German Trade Union Federation (DGB), the most influential group outside parliament and historically interwoven with the SPD, massively stepped up their discourse against Agenda 2010, especially prior to the Hartz IV law in July 2004, but the rumble subsided quickly after a summit meeting with Schröder in August 2004. The trade unions suffered from a lot of attrition in that process as their members defected in droves either because the unions&#x27; attitude was perceived as too lenient or as too strongly opposed. There were no strikes against Agenda 2010 as the German constitution prohibits politically motivated strikes, but some demonstrations at least were organized and supported by the unions.

In December 2003, the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, dominated by the opposition CDU party, blocked some of the reforms on political grounds until several compromises were reached, many of which put a particularly painful twist—for those affected, for example the unemployed or the ill—on the measures taken.

Dissatisfaction with Agenda 2010, and in particular with Hartz IV, lead to thousands of people protesting in the streets of Berlin, Leipzig and other big cities particularly in eastern, but also western Germany over the summer of 2004 (see Monday demonstrations, 2004).

Dissent with the Agenda 2010 had also promoted the foundation of a new political party, the Electoral Alternative for Labor and Social Justice (WASG) by long-term SPD members and union activists. The WASG was squarely against the measures taken in the Agenda 2010 process and ran in the 2005 North Rhine-Westphalia state election, where it gained 2.2% of the votes and no seat, against what it considered &quot;the neoliberal consensus&quot; displayed by the governing centre-left political parties and the more conservative opposition alike. For the 2005 German federal election the WASG formed a successful electoral alliance with The Left Party.PDS, which reached 8.7% of the votes. In June 2007 both parties merged to a new party, The Left.

==Consequences==
The immediate aftermath of the Agenda 2010 reforms was that unemployment rose to over 5.2 million people in February 2005 and Schröder called German companies &quot;lazy&quot; for failing to hire more workers. Beginning in 2005, however, unemployment figures began falling and, in May 2007, unemployment was at 3.8 million people, a 5½ year low. The apparent success of Agenda 2010 in reducing unemployment in Germany has been cited in the debate over extending long-term unemployment insurance benefits in the United States.

A debate about the socioeconomic results of the Agenda 2010 reforms was stirred by the release of a study conducted by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in late 2006. The study classified 4 percent of people living in West Germany as well as 20 percent of people living in East Germany as living in &quot;precarious&quot; socio-economic conditions. Although the topic of social conditions in Germany was much debated as a result of this study, with many people (including those in Schröder&#x27;s own party) laying blame on Schröder and his Hartz IV reforms for the growing economic inequality in Germany, no policy changes have been enacted as a direct result of the study.

By 2008, the wage share of national income had reached a 50-year low of 64.5%.

Another sign that economic inequality has risen in Germany can be seen in the fact that the number of Germans living below the poverty line has increased from 11% in 2001, to 12.3% in 2004, and about 14% in 2007. According to 2007 government statistics, one out of every six children was poor, a post-1960-record, with more than a third of all children poor in big cities like Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen.

Voters seemed to respond to the Agenda 2010 and Hartz IV reforms negatively. In the 2004 elections to the EU parliament, the SPD reached an all-time postwar national election low of only 21% of the votes.

The SPD lost by a wide margin in the 2005 regional election in its North Rhine-Westphalia &quot;heartland&quot;, where the regional SPD government was replaced by a CDU-FDP coalition, giving the winners a working majority in the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, the federal legislature&#x27;s upper house. The Social Democrats losses were widely attributed to voters&#x27; discontent with the Agenda 2010 reforms.

Subsequently, Chancellor Schröder triggered a loss in a confidence vote, which, in turn, necessitated an early general election. In the autumn of 2005, one year ahead of schedule, general elections were held and the Social Democrats were defeated.

By 2011, unemployment had fallen from its 10% average of the mid-decade to around 7%, its lowest since the early 1990s.

Some scientists see the wage depression in Germany fostered by the Agenda 2010 as one of the causes of the European debt crisis.

<text>Stephen Anthony Bucknor, OJ (born 31 May 1946) is a Jamaican former international cricket umpire.

Bucknor umpired in a record 128 Test matches between 1989 and 2009, and also umpired in 181 One Day Internationals during this period, including five consecutive Cricket World Cup finals from 1992 to 2007. Before becoming a cricket umpire, he was a football player and referee and a high school mathematics teacher. 
In October 2007, he was awarded the Order of Jamaica, Commander Class, for &quot;outstanding services in the field of sports&quot;.

==Football goalkeeper==
Bucknor played as a goalkeeper in Jamaican parish leagues in the 1960s. In 1964 he played in goal for Jamaica in a schoolboy international versus Brazil, which Jamaica drew 1–1.

== Football referee ==
Bucknor was a FIFA referee in a CONCACAF and World Cup qualifier between El Salvador and the Netherlands Antilles in 1988.

== Cricket umpire ==
Bucknor&#x27;s first international cricket fixture was a One Day International (ODI) between the West Indies and India at Antigua on 18 March 1989. His first Test match was at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica, between 28 April and 3 May 1989, with the competing teams again being the West Indies and India. After umpiring in a few international matches, he was selected to umpire at the 1992 Cricket World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, and went on to stand in the final despite being quite inexperienced. Bucknor also officiated in the next four World Cup finals in 1996, 1999, 2003 and 2007, with the 2007 World Cup taking place in his native West Indies.

In 1994 the ICC introduced a policy whereby one of the umpires in each Test match would be independent of the competing nations, selected from an International Panel of Umpires. Bucknor was a member of this panel from its foundation until the ICC changed its policy on umpires again in 2002. Since then both umpires in Test matches, and one of the umpires in ODIs have been independent of the competing countries. The officials are now chosen from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, whom the ICC consider to be the world&#x27;s best umpires. Bucknor maintained a place on the Elite Panel from its foundation until his retirement.

In May 2006, he accused TV companies of doctoring their images to make umpires look bad and key players look good. Bucknor was one of the standing umpires in the 2007 Cricket World Cup final, during which play was infamously continued despite very poor light. Consequently, he and the four other officials involved were suspended from the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. Dave Richardson, the general manager of cricket at the ICC, has said Bucknor&#x27;s umpiring accuracy was at 96% during 2005–06, above the average of 94.8% for the Elite Panel. In 2007, he was short-listed for the Umpire of the Year award, which was ultimately won by Simon Taufel. In January 2008, he was removed by the ICC from officiating in the third Test between Australia and India in Perth, and replaced by Billy Bowden, after his several incorrect decisions in the second Test in Sydney had contributed to India&#x27;s defeat. Former umpire Dickie Bird suggested that Bucknor had &quot;gone on too long&quot;, while Bucknor blamed the BCCI&#x27;s financial power for his ouster.

Looking back on his career, Steve Bucknor recalled making several incorrect decisions against Sachin Tendulkar from India. The ICC confirmed on 23 February 2009 that Bucknor had decided to retire from umpiring in March 2009. His final Test match was the 3rd Test between South Africa and Australia at Cape Town on 19–23 March, and his last One Day International match was the 4th ODI between his native West Indies and England at Barbados on 29 March, bringing his 20-year career as an official to an end.

== Achievements as an umpire ==

=== Cricket World Cup ===
Bucknor has stood as an onfield umpire in five World Cup tournaments, during which he has officiated 44 matches including five finals.

=== Test match record ===
Bucknor held the record for the most Test matches umpired until December 2019, when Aleem Dar of Pakistan stood in his 129th Test match as an on-field umpire, surpassing his record of officiating in the most number of Test matches. He was the first umpire to have officiated in over 100 Test matches.

=== Awards ===
Bucknor has received the ICC&#x27;s Bronze Bails Awards for umpiring in 100 ODIs, as well as the Golden Bails Award for umpiring 100 Test matches.

<doc id="1206005" wikidata="Q6005118" url="?curid=1206005" title="Immigration reduction in the United States">
<text>Immigration reduction refers to a government and social policy in the United States that advocates a reduction in the amount of immigration allowed into the country. Steps advocated for reducing the numbers of immigrants include advocating stronger action to prevent illegal entry and illegal migration, and reductions in non-immigrant temporary work visas (such as H-1B, L-1 and J-1). Some advocate tightening the requirements for legal immigration requirements to reduce numbers or move the proportions of legal immigrants away from those on family reunification programs to skills-based criteria.

Many immigration reformists only oppose illegal migration and support continued legal immigration methods. Some immigration reductionists want to reduce current legal immigration percentages until fewer adverse effects are created by illegal migration.

==Nativism==

There have been several discernible groups at various times within the United States, which pushed for immigration restrictions, with separate concerns, origins, and aims; thus there are several antecedents for the modern immigration reduction movement. These include the nativist United States American Party, often called the Know Nothing movement of the mid-19th century, which objected to increased Catholic immigration of predominantly Irish and German origin; the Workingman&#x27;s Party which objected to immigration laborers from China to California during the late-19th century, a sentiment that ultimately led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; the Immigration Restriction League, which objected to greatly increased immigration from southern and eastern Europe during the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and the joint congressional Dillingham Commission, which studied this latter complaint and proposed numerical restrictions. Eventually, following World War I, these studies led to the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924.

==Labor unions==
Organized labor generally favored restrictions, especially from Asia. The National Labor Union (1866–1874) campaigned for immigration restrictions as well as the eight-hour workday, as did the American Federation of Labor under the leadership of Samuel Gompers. The AFL–CIO did not reverse its opposition to immigration until 1999. The early United States Socialist Party was split over the issue, with some Socialist leaders including Jack London and Congressman Victor Berger supporting immigration restrictions; the party as a whole never had consensus and officially opposed only the importation of strikebreakers.

==Overpopulation==
Concern over overpopulation was stimulated by Paul R. Ehrlich, who both founded Zero Population Growth and published &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; in 1968. The popular book foretold alarming disasters that would inevitably occur in the next decades. Though some of his predictions did not come to pass, many believe his main points are valid, and they succeeded in inspiring a movement. Environmentalists including David R. Brower and David Foreman took the threat seriously. The Zero Population Growth organization did not involve itself, for the most part, in U.S. immigration policy, and a subset of the overpopulation movement grew which believed that immigration needed to be reduced, arguing that immigration was driving most U.S. population growth. These activists founded organizations separate from ZPG which would specifically address immigration issues. Among the important early organizations was Negative Population Growth, founded in 1972 by Donald Mann.

==FAIR==
The leading inspiration for the modern movement is the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), Founded in 1979, it is the largest and best funded organization in the movement. Three years later, John Tanton formed US, Inc. as an incubator and funding source to help form other organizations. According to public tax records, US, Inc, FAIR, and other Tanton organizations have received large donations from the Pioneer Fund and from the foundations controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife. Tanton created US English (an English-only advocacy group), the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), ProEnglish (another English-only advocacy group), and The Social Contract Press. US, Inc and FAIR have provided funding and logistical support to other organizations, including American Immigration Control Foundation (AICF), California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR), Californians for Population Stabilization (CAPS), and the recent Protect Arizona Now (PAN) initiative, Proposition 200. 
The movement seemed to be triumphant in 1994 when California voters passed Proposition 187, an initiative that limited benefits to illegal aliens that had been authored and promoted by CCIR. However, one federal judge enjoined implementation of parts of the law as unconstitutional, and Democratic governor Gray Davis refused to pursue an appeal of the lower court decision, abandoning Proposition 187. Residual resentment over the racially divisive campaigns on both sides of the issue made immigration a topic that politicians largely avoided dealing with. A notable exception has been Tom Tancredo, who was elected to Congress from Littleton, Colorado in 1994. Together with Patrick Buchanan and the Tanton network, Tancredo has emerged as the most conspicuous voice advocating immigration reduction in Congress.
==The Alliance for Stabilizing America&#x27;s Population==
The immigration reduction movement was partly revived by The Alliance for Stabilizing America&#x27;s Population coalition. In 1997 members from a range of immigration reduction and environmental organizations met to rededicate themselves to the effort of population stabilization. Organized by Population-Environment Balance, it included such diverse groups as:
*Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny (BOND)
*California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR)
*California Wildlife Defenders (CWD)
*Californians for Population Stabilization (CAPS)
*Carrying Capacity Network (CCN)
Another effort was the coalition formed under the name U.S. Sustainable Population Policy Project (USS3P) in 1996 by Douglas La Follette and David Pimentel. The USS3P membership contained many immigration reductionists of the time. In 1999 it sought cosponsors for a major national conference on immigration. A number of major individuals and minor organizations joined as co-sponsors, but no large national groups joined and it folded in 2000 without holding the intended conference.

The Internet offered new opportunities for communication by immigration reductionists, as it has with countless other movements. Peter Brimelow founded his VDARE writers collective in 1999. The year 1999 also saw the founding by Craig Nelson of ProjectUSA in New York City, which used billboards to advertise Census Bureau and other statistics about immigration in a campaign dubbed &quot;Billboard Democracy,&quot; and publishes an ezine in which the term &quot;Minuteman&quot; was first used (2002) in connection with civilian border patrols. The NumbersUSA group founded by Roy Beck set up an automated system for website visitors to send advocacy faxes to their legislators on immigration topics. Numerous websites, email lists, weblogs, and other resources furthered the effort.

The electoral success of Arizona&#x27;s Proposition 200, PAN, indicates the support for immigration reductionism among voters. The PAN initiative qualified for the ballot following the expenditure by FAIR of hundreds of thousands of dollars for signature gathering, plus comparable sums for campaigning with some additional amounts raised locally. The initiative was adopted by the public by a significant margin and is likely to inspire similar efforts in other states. The success of Proposition 200 in Arizona was followed in April 2005 by the Minuteman Project, in which volunteers came to Arizona to help patrol the border, although this project did not have the support of the United States Border Patrol and generated some controversy. The organizers of the Minuteman Project have announced plans for similar projects in other states including Texas, California, and Michigan.

===Candidate Donald Trump, 2016===
In 2016 billionaire New York City businessman and television personality Donald Trump ran a successful presidential campaign promising to stop illegal immigration; deport all undocumented immigrants living in the country illegally; limit legal immigration; stop Muslims from entering the U.S.; ban travel to the US from what he called &quot;terror prone&quot; countries such as Iran, Libya, Somalia and Syria; triple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; and build a wall along the nation&#x27;s 3,145 kilometer (1,954 mi) border with Mexico to stop illegal aliens from crossing into the U.S. Trump also vowed to cut off all federal funding to sanctuary cities, end birthright citizenship, and immediately terminate President Obama&#x27;s two executive amnesties including Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which he said were illegal. Although Trump&#x27;s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and even some of his fellow Republicans such as Mitt Romney called Trump&#x27;s anti-immigrant platform racist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic, his proposals found broad support in the heartland and the south. As president he enacted a number of policies aimed at reducing immigration, including signing executive orders banning the admission to the United States for residents of multiple, Muslim-majority nations; separating families of immigrants; reversing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; greatly limiting the number of refugees and asylum seekers allowed into the country; and strengthening the southern border.

==Targeted immigration levels==
Immigration reductionists differ on the ideal level of immigration they would like to see into the United States. Some believe the numbers should be set each year at whatever level would, in conjunction with the current fertility rate and emigration from the U.S., maintain zero population growth in the country. The most prominent immigration reductionist in government today is U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, R-CO. Tancredo has authored a bill that calls for limiting annual immigration to between 30,000 and 300,000. The organization, Population-Environment Balance (PEB), issued an &quot;Immigration Moratorium Action Plan&quot; calling for a &quot;non-piercable&quot; cap of 100,000 persons annually, which would be a 95% cut from current levels. 

There are also some who support a moratorium on immigration. The Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America claims that 43% of Californians polled said that a 3-year moratorium on immigration would be beneficial to the state (compared to 40% who said it would be futile). The America First Party calls for a ten-year moratorium, with only spouses and children of citizens allowed in. Other advocates for moratoriums include the Reform Party and 2004 Constitution Party presidential candidate Michael Peroutka.

The Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance (now defunct), two groups that both operate out of the same Washington, D.C. address, issue frequent statements that advocating for the numbers recommended by the Jordan Commission, 700,000 annually, is &quot;counter-productive&quot;. In a National Alert, the CCN warned that organizations supporting numbers higher than 300,000 undercut the movement, and they specifically criticize the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA.

Some groups not connected to the immigration reduction movement nonetheless support a reduction to legal immigration levels of around 500,000 to 600,000. In their 1997 book, &quot;Misplaced Blame&quot;, Alan Durning and Christopher Crowther of Northwest Environment Watch write that illegal immigration gets too much attention, and identify five main sources of population growth, including lack of access to family planning as well as a misguided legal immigration policy, and subsidies to domestic migration. They readily admit that immigration should be reduced by an unspecified amount, but they also show concern for the rights of existing residents.

==Proposed methods to reduce illegal immigration==
===Border barriers===

The United States-Mexico barrier has been partially constructed to reduce the flow of unauthorized migrants into the United States. Donald Trump has proposed an expansion of the wall.

===E-Verify===
===Attrition through enforcement===

Pro-enforcement U.S. think tanks such as the Center for Immigration Studies have supported an &quot;attrition through enforcement&quot; doctrine. The aim here is to, as that organization states, &quot;Shrink the illegal population through consistent, across-the-board enforcement of the immigration law. By deterring the settlement of new illegals, by increasing deportations to the extent possible, and, most importantly, by increasing the number of illegals already here who give up and deport themselves, the United States can bring about an annual decrease in the illegal-alien population, rather than allowing it to continually increase.&quot; This approach concedes that mass deportations of illegal aliens is logistically, economically, and politically untenable.

Arizona SB1070, the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure enacted in the U.S. in generations, explicitly states its intent as implementing the attrition through enforcement strategy.

===Intergovernmental cooperation===
Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin supports coordination with federal authorities through the use of Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section 287(g) provides for the deputization of state and local law enforcement officers, for the purposes of reporting of immigrants who have violated immigration law. Morristown, New Jersey mayor Donald Cresitello (Democrat) has sought to deputize his police as immigration agents. Newark, New Jersey city councilman Ron Rice, Jr. has proposed a resolution mandating police to report felony suspects when they are found to be in the United States illegally. Furthermore, the Attorney General of New Jersey Anne Milgram has expanded officers power regarding illegal immigrants. She told the state police to inform federal authorities when an illegal immigrant is arrested in an indictable crime or for drunk driving. There are an estimated 380,000 people living in New Jersey without proper immigration documents. She said that she wanted local, county and state police to hand more serious cases directly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

===Legislative initiatives===
Others focus on lobbying to lower future illegal immigration levels through congressional action, and to fight amnesties for existing illegal immigrants.

Many immigration restrictionists question the 1898 Supreme Court ruling &quot;U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark,&quot; which held that individuals born on U.S. soil to non-citizen parents are U.S. citizens and guaranteed all the rights thereof. They feel that citizenship should be denied to the children of immigrants without valid immigration status. Thus they have sought to end birthright citizenship, through a constitutional amendment or a congressional act.

Denial of public benefits to undocumented individuals is believed to remove the incentives and rewards for illegal immigrants. The 1994 California Proposition 187 and the 2004 Arizona Proposition 200 &quot;Protect Arizona Now&quot; were written to require proof of legal status in order to receive non-mandated benefits.

On January 29, 2025, a majority of legislators in the Tennessee Senate voted to adopt SB6002, a bill which &quot;creates criminal penalties for officials who adopt sanctuary policies and subsequently requires their removal from office upon conviction&quot;. The act charges a Class E felony, resulting in a potential prison sentence of between one to six years, upon &quot;each official who, in their capacity as a member of the governing body of a local government, votes in the affirmative to adopt a sanctuary policy&quot;.

==Differences within immigration reductionism==
Many who support reduced immigration numbers oppose association with the more extreme groups. The Federation for American Immigration Reform has spoken out in 2004 against the views of another reductionist leader, Virginia Abernethy, calling her views &quot;repulsive separatist views,&quot; and called on her to resign from the advisory board of Protect Arizona Now in Arizona. PEB and CCN are also critical of FAIR for FAIR&#x27;s support of a national ID card, which PEB and CCN oppose. The Protect Arizona Now movement split, with two rival state-level organizations, one supported by FAIR, the other supported by PEB and CCN, working to support the passage of the ballot initiative.

==Public opinion on immigration reduction==
Some polls such as a late 2013 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute have found widespread opposition to immigration reduction. Said survey stated that 63% of Americans support creating a pathway to citizenship so that formerly illegal residents of the U.S. could gradually acquire it while only 18% back a hypothetical plan to find and deport all illegal residents.

<text>Little Rock Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base located approximately northeast of Little Rock, Arkansas.

The facility covers 6,217 acres (2,516 ha) with a resident population of over 3,300 and working population of approximately 7,200.

Little Rock AFB is the primary C-130 Hercules training base for the Department of Defense, training C-130 pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and loadmasters from all branches of the US military in tactical airlift and aerial delivery. It is home to C-130H and C-130J aircraft, as well as the C-130 Center of Excellence (i.e., schools for C-130H and C-130J crews).

The host unit at Little Rock AFB is the 19th Airlift Wing (19 AW), assigned to the Air Mobility Command&#x27;s 18th Air Force. The wing provides the Department of Defense the largest C-130 Hercules transport fleet in the world, supplying humanitarian airlift relief to victims of disasters, as well as airdropping supplies and troops into the heart of contingency operations in hostile areas.

Other organizations at Little Rock AFB include the 189th Airlift Wing of the Arkansas Air National Guard, and the C-130 division of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School. All of these organizations fly the C-130 Hercules.

Little Rock Air Force Base is the fourth largest employer in the state of Arkansas, with a local economic impact of $813.6 million.

== History ==
Little Rock Air Force Base was authorized in 1953 and construction began on 6 November 1953.

The base opened on 24 January 1955 with 6,100 acres donated by landowners, valued at $1.2 million in 1952. Communications and several storage buildings, JATO facility, ordnance igloos, track and loading platform were completed by 30 June 1955, and the base was opened to limited air traffic on 9 September 1955. The base headquarters facility was accepted 31 January 1956, and all runways and other operational concrete areas were completed by January 1957.

The base was officially activated by Strategic Air Command (SAC) on 1 August 1955, hosting SAC&#x27;s 384th Bombardment Wing (384 BW) flying the Boeing B-47E Stratojet, and the 70th Reconnaissance Wing (70 RW) flying the RB-47 Stratojet and KC-97 Stratofreighter.

In 1960, the Air Force announced that Little Rock Air Force Base would house 18 Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles located throughout the state of Arkansas. In 1961, the 70 RW was redesignated as the 70th Bombardment Wing (Medium) and converted to the B-47, but was inactivated the following year before being declared combat-ready.

In September 1962, the 154th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Arkansas Air National Guard relocated to Little Rock AFB and reorganized as the 189th Tactical Reconnaissance Group (189 TRG).

In October 1962, the 384th Bomb Wing deployed 11 Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft to civilian municipal airports around the nation for dispersal alert purposes during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Also in 1962, SAC established the 308th Strategic Missile Wing (308 SMW) as the host organization for Little Rock AFB&#x27;s Titan II missile operations, with the first of the Titan II missiles installed at a site in Searcy, Arkansas in February 1963.

In September 1964, the 384th Bomb Wing inactivated following the retirement of the B-47 from front-line service in SAC. That same year, SAC&#x27;s 43d Bombardment Wing transferred from Carswell AFB, Texas with its B-58 Hustler supersonic aircraft. The 43d Bomb Wing would continue to operate at Little Rock until the B-58s were withdrawn from operational service in January 1970.

In June 1965, Little Rock&#x27;s 189 TRG became the first Air National Guard unit to operate the RF-101 Voodoo and by December, had assumed the RF-101 Replacement Training Unit (RTU) mission for the entire Air Force. The same year, the base and associated flying units also participated in various relief efforts such as a tornado that ripped through Conway, Arkansas in April and Hurricane Betsy in Louisiana in September.

In the 1970s the base went through significant changes, with the first C-130 Hercules aircraft arriving in March 1970. 
On 31 March 1970, Little Rock Air Force Base officially transferred from SAC to Tactical Air Command (TAC), with TAC&#x27;s 314th Tactical Airlift Wing (314 TAW) taking over host wing responsibilities. 
Although SAC&#x27;s 308 SMW and its Titan II ICBMs continued to be a major tenant, the base&#x27;s primary mission became C-130 tactical airlift operations and training, with two operational C-130 squadrons assigned and two C-130 training squadrons assigned. 
In 1974, following the divestiture of C-130 tactical airlift aircraft from TAC, both the 314 TAW and Little Rock AFB transferred from TAC control to that of the Military Airlift Command (MAC).

On 1 January 1976, the 189 TRG transferred being a TAC-gained unit to a SAC-gained unit when it converted to the KC-135 Stratotanker and was redesignated the 189th Air Refueling Group (189 ARG), becoming one of the first Air National Guard units to be assigned to Strategic Air Command with a concomitant requirement to maintain a 24-hour alert force at Little Rock as well as deployments to support worldwide tanker task forces.

===Damascus incident===

On 18 September 1980, an airman conducting maintenance on a USAF Titan II missile at Little Rock Air Force Base&#x27;s Launch Complex 374-7 in Southside (Van Buren County), just north of Damascus, Arkansas, dropped a socket which fell impacting the rocket&#x27;s first stage fuel tank resulting in a leak.
In response, evacuations were made in the area.
The leaking fuel exploded on 19 September. 
The force of the blast resulted in the W53 nuclear warhead being hurled about from the launch complex&#x27;s entry gate; its safety features operated correctly and prevented any loss of radioactive material. 
An Air Force airman was killed and the launch complex was destroyed.

===Recent years===
On 1 October 1986, the 189 ARG saw yet another mission change when it was redesignated as the 189th Tactical Airlift Group (189 TAG) and converted to the C-130 aircraft, with transfer of operational claimancy to MAC.

During the 1991 Gulf War, the 314 TAW&#x27;s two operational C-130 squadrons and the 189 TAG&#x27;s C-130 squadron supported operations from both the middle east and European theaters. Later that year, the 314th Tactical Airlift Wing was redesignated as the 314th Airlift Wing (314 AW), and following the disestablishment of MAC in 1992, the base and the 314 AW were transferred to the new Air Mobility Command (AMC). The 189 TAG was also redesignated as the 189th Airlift Group (189 AG) the same year, followed by redesignation as the 189th Airlift Wing (189 AW) in 1995.

In 1993, the base and the 314 AW transferred to Air Combat Command (ACC), as part the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s decision to transfer continental U.S.-based C-130s from AMC to ACC. In 1997, the U.S. Air Force reversed this decision, returning most C-130 airlift back to AMC claimancy. However, given the 314 AW&#x27;s primary training mission as the Formal Training Unit (FTU) for C-130s, the base and the 314 AW were transferred to the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and the base&#x27;s two operational Regular Air Force C-130 squadrons were organized under the 463d Airlift Group, an AMC unit.

From the mid-1990s to the late 1990s, the 314 AW and the 463 AG supported the air war over Serbia and since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the 463 AG has supported both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom until the 463 AG was inactivated on 1 October 2008.

In its 50-year history, Little Rock Air Force Base has been operated by six Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs): SAC, TAC, MAC, AMC, ACC, and AETC. 
These represent every possible MAJCOM a continental U.S.-based operational flying base could have been assigned to except for the former Air Defense Command/Aerospace Defense Command (ADC), Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), and the current Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).

In 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama visited the Little Rock base to mark the second anniversary of the Let&#x27;s Move initiative.

<doc id="1206009" wikidata="Q17035409" url="?curid=1206009" title="Medieval Welsh literature">
<text>Medieval Welsh literature is the literature written in the Welsh language during the Middle Ages. This includes material starting from the 5th century AD, when Welsh was in the process of becoming distinct from Common Brittonic, and continuing to the works of the 16th century.

The Welsh language became distinct from other dialects of Old British sometime between AD 400 and 700; the earliest surviving literature in Welsh is poetry dating from this period. The poetic tradition represented in the work of &quot;Y Cynfeirdd&quot; (&quot;The Early Poets&quot;), as they are known, then survives for over a thousand years to the work of the &quot;Poets of the Nobility&quot; in the 16th century.

The core tradition was praise poetry; and the poet Taliesin was regarded as the first in the line. The other aspect of the tradition was the professionalism of the poets and their reliance on patronage from kings, princes and nobles for their living, similar to the way Irish bards and Norse skalds were patronized for the production of complex, often highly alliterative forms of verse. The fall of the Kingdom of Gwynedd and the loss of Welsh independence in any form in 1282 proved a crisis in the tradition, but one that was eventually overcome. It led to the innovation of the development of the cywydd meter, a looser definition of praise, and a reliance on the nobility for patronage.
The professionalism of the poetic tradition was sustained by a Guild of Poets, or Order of Bards, with its own &quot;rule book&quot; emphasising the making of poetry as a craft. Under its rules poets undertook an apprenticeship of nine years to become fully qualified. The rules also set out the payment a poet could expect for his work. These payments varied according to how long a poet had been in training and also the demand for poetry at particular times during the year.

Alongside the court poet, kings, princes and nobles patronised an official storyteller (Welsh: &quot;cyfarwydd&quot;). Like poets, the storytellers were also professionals; but unlike the poets, little of their work has survived. What has survived are literary creations based on native Welsh tales which would have been told by the storytellers. The bulk of this material is found in the collection known today as the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Medieval Welsh prose was not confined to the story tradition but also included a large body of both religious and practical works, in addition to a large amount translated from other languages.

==Welsh poetry before 1100==
In Welsh literature the period before 1100 is known as the period of &quot;Y Cynfeirdd&quot; (&quot;The Early Poets&quot;) or &quot;Yr Hengerdd&quot; (&quot;The Old Poetry&quot;). It roughly dates from the birth of the Welsh language until the arrival of the Normans in Wales towards the end of the 11th century.

The oldest Welsh literature does not belong to the territory we know as Wales today, but rather to northern England and southern Scotland (collectively Yr Hen Ogledd), and so could be classified as being composed in Cumbric, a Brythonic dialect closely related to Old Welsh. Though it is dated to the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries it has survived only in 13th- and 14th-century manuscript copies. Some of these early poets&#x27; names are known from the 9th-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, traditionally ascribed to the historian Nennius. The &quot;Historia&quot; lists the famous poets from the time of King Ida, AD 547–559:

:&quot;At that time, Talhaiarn Tataguen was famed for poetry, and Neirin, and Taliesin, and Bluchbard, and Cian, who is called Guenith Guaut, were all famous at the same time in British (that is, Brythonic or Welsh) poetry.&quot;

Of the poets named here it is believed that works that can be identified as Aneirin&#x27;s and Taliesin&#x27;s have survived.
===Taliesin===
The poetry of Taliesin has been preserved in a 14th-century manuscript known as &quot;Llyfr Taliesin&quot; (Book of Taliesin). This manuscript contains a large body of later mystical poetry attributed to the poet, but scholars have recognised twelve poems that belong to the 6th century. They are all poems of praise: one for Cynan Garwyn, king of Powys about 580; two for Gwallawg, king of Elmet, a kingdom based around the modern Leeds; and nine other poems associated with Urien Rheged, a ruler of the kingdom of Rheged, located around the Solway Firth, and his son, Owain.

Taliesin&#x27;s verses in praise of Urien and Owain became models for later poets, who turned to him for inspiration as they praised their own patrons in terms that he had used for his.

===Aneirin===
Aneirin, a near-contemporary of Taliesin, wrote a series of poems to create one long poem called &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. It records the Battle of Catraeth, fought between the Britons of the kingdom of Gododdin (centred on Eidyn, the modern Edinburgh) and the Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia in the north east of England. This battle was fought at Catterick in about the year 598. It has survived in &quot;Llyfr Aneirin&quot; (The Book of Aneirin), a manuscript dating from c. 1265.

===Llywarch Hen and Heledd===
The poetry associated with Llywarch Hen, &quot;Canu Llywarch Hen&quot; and with Heledd, &quot;Canu Heledd&quot;, dates from a somewhat later period: the whole of &quot;Canu Heledd&quot; is generally thought to be from the 9th century; while the earliest parts of &quot;Canu Llywarch&quot; are probably also 9th century, other parts of the cycle may be as late as the 11th or 12th century. These poems, in the form of monologues, express the sorrow and affliction felt at the loss of the eastern portion of the Kingdom of Powys (present day Shropshire) to the English, but they are also works where nature is an important element in the background, reflecting the main action and feelings of the poetry itself.

===Other early poetry===
Though the Anglo-Saxon invaders seem to break Welsh hearts in most of the early poetry, there are some poems of encouragement and the hope of an eventual and decisive defeat that would drive them back into the sea. One such poem is the 10th-century &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; from the Book of Taliesin which sees a coalition of Irish, British, and Scandinavian forces defeating the English and restoring Britain to the Welsh.

This period also produced religious poetry, such as the englynion in praise of the Trinity found in the 9th-century Juvencus Manuscript (Cambridge MS Ff. 4.42), which is now at Cambridge University Library. In the Book of Taliesin we find a 9th-century poem &quot;Edmyg Dinbych&quot; (&quot;In Praise of Tenby&quot;, a town in Pembrokeshire), probably produced by a court poet in Dyfed to celebrate the New Year (Welsh: &quot;Calan&quot;). The book also includes important poems which were probably not composed by Taliesin, including the &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; (&quot;The Great Prophecy of Britain&quot;) and &quot;Preiddeu Annwfn&quot;, (&quot;The Spoils of Annwn&quot;), and the Book of Aneirin has preserved an early Welsh nursery rhyme, &quot;Peis Dinogat&quot; (&quot;Dinogad&#x27;s Smock&quot;). Much of the nature poetry, gnomic poetry, prophetic poetry, and religious poetry in the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Red Book of Hergest is also believed to date from this period.

==Welsh poetry 1100–1600==

From c. 1100 to 1600 Welsh poetry can be divided roughly into two distinct periods: the period of the &quot;Poets of the Princes&quot; who worked before the loss of Welsh independence in 1282, and the &quot;Poets of the Nobility&quot; who worked from 1282 until the period of the English incorporation of Wales in the 16th century.

===Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 – c. 1300)===
In Welsh this period is known as &quot;Beirdd y Tywysogion&quot; (Poets of the Princes) or &quot;Y Gogynfeirdd&quot; (The Less Early Poets). The main source for the poetry of the 12th and 13th centuries is the Hendregadredd manuscript, an anthology of court poetry brought together at the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey from about 1282 until 1350.

The poets of this period were professionals who worked in the various princely courts in Wales. They were members of a Guild of poets whose rights and responsibilities were enshrined in native Welsh law; and as such, they worked within a developed literary culture and with inflexible traditions. Bardic families were still common—the poet Meilyr Brydydd had a poet son and at least two poet grandsons—but it was becoming more and more usual for the craft of poetry to be taught formally, in bardic schools which might only be run by the &quot;pencerdd&quot; (chief musician). The &quot;pencerdd&quot; was the top of his profession, and a special chair was set aside for him in the court, in an honoured position next to the heir. When he performed he was expected to sing twice: once in honour of God, and once in honour of the king. The &quot;bardd teulu&quot; (household poet) was one of the 24 officers of the court and he was responsible for singing for the military retinue before going into battle, and for the queen in the privacy of her chamber. The lowest ranking poets were the &quot;cerddorion&quot; (musicians).

The poetry praises the military prowess of the prince in a language that is deliberately antiquarian and obscure, echoing the earlier praise poetry tradition of Taliesin. There is also some religious poems and poetry in praise of women.

With the death of the last native prince of Wales in 1282, the tradition gradually disappears. In fact, Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch&#x27;s (fl. 1277–83) elegy on the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, is one of the most notable poems of the era. Other prominent poets of this period include:
*Meilyr Brydydd, fl. c. 1100–1137; the earliest of the Gogynfeirdd
*Bleddyn Fardd, fl. c. 1258–1284;
*Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr; fl. c. 1155–1200;
*Dafydd Benfras, fl. c. 1220–58; and
*Llywarch ap Llywelyn (also known as &quot;Prydydd y Moch&quot; (English: &quot;Pigs&#x27; Poet&quot;)), fl. 1174/5-1220.

A rather different poet of this period was Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd (d. 1170) who as the son of Prince Owain Gwynedd, was not a professional poet.

===Poets of the Nobility, or Cywyddwyr (c. 1300 – c. 1600)===
The poetic tradition thrived in Wales as long as there were patrons available to welcome its practitioners. Until 1282, Wales consisted of a number of &#x27;kingdoms&#x27;, each with its own independent ruler; this ensured that there was no shortage of courts available to the travelling professional poet or &quot;bard&quot;. After 1282 the poetic tradition survived by turning to the land-owning nobility to act as patrons, and these included some Norman lords who had successfully integrated themselves with the Welsh.

Much of the poetry of this period is praise poetry, in praise of the patron and his family, his ancestors, his house and his generosity; and the &quot;cywydd&quot; is the most popular poetic metre used. Because of the popularity of the &quot;cywydd&quot;, this period is also known as the period of the &quot;Cywyddwyr&quot; (poets who wrote using the &quot;cywydd&quot; metre). The poetry was very often sung to the accompaniment of the harp. Though praise was the main matter of poetry, satire (Welsh: &quot;dychan&quot;) also thrived. The poets organised themselves into a Guild to protect their professional status, and from time to time their rules were revised and updated. Perhaps the most important such revisions were those concerning patronage and poetic rank made at the Caerwys eisteddfod of 1523. The work of numerous poets of this period survives; some are anonymous, but very many are identified. Here are a few of the most prominent and influential of these:

====Dafydd ap Gwilym (c. 1315/20 – c. 1350/1370)====
Wales&#x27;s greatest poet worked during the period of the Poets of the Nobility. He is known for such poems as &quot;The Girls of Llanbadarn&quot;, &quot;Trouble at a Tavern&quot;, &quot;The Wind&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;. For more information about his life and work, see Dafydd ap Gwilym.

====Iolo Goch (c. 1325 – c. 1398)====
From the Vale of Clwyd, Iolo Goch (English: &quot;Red Iolo&quot;) bridged between the periods of the Poets of the Princes and Poets of the Nobility. Early in his career he composed in the former tradition, but he was among the first to sing the praises of the nobles and others using the &quot;cywydd&quot;. One of his main patrons was Ithel ap Robert, archdeacon of St Asaph. Perhaps his most famous work is a &quot;cywydd&quot; in praise of Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s home at Sycharth.

====Siôn Cent (c. 1400 – 1430/45)====
Traditionally associated with Breconshire, Siôn Cent is most famous for using his poetry in the service of his Christian beliefs, and standing outside the tradition of praise of patron. He uses the &quot;cywydd&quot; for his work, to attack the sins of this world. Perhaps his most famous poem is &quot;I wagedd ac oferedd y byd&quot; (English: &quot;[In praise of] the vanity and dissipation of the world&quot;). He turns his back on the praise of nobles, which he sees as flattery and falsehood, and sets his eyes on the blessedness of heaven.

====Guto&#x27;r Glyn (c. 1435 – c. 1493)====
Guto&#x27;r Glyn is associated with Glyn Ceiriog, Denbighshire, where many of his patrons lived. He also wrote poems for other patrons in the four corners of Wales whose houses he visited on his journeys. He was a master of the praise tradition in poetry. Guto was also a soldier who fought on the Yorkist side during the War of the Roses, but spent his last years as a lay guest at the Cistercian abbey of Valle Crucis, near Llangollen (a short distance from Glyn Ceiriog).

====Dafydd Nanmor (fl. 1450 – 1490)====
Dafydd Nanmor, born at Nanmor (or Nantmor), Gwynedd, is one of the most significant poets of this period. It is said that he was exiled to south Wales for overstepping the mark in his poetry and spent the rest of his life outside Gwynedd. The 20th-century critic Saunders Lewis saw particular significance in his work. Lewis saw him as a poet of philosophy who praised the ideal ruler as he praised his patrons who saw that within the Welsh tradition all who had privilege and power also had responsibilities towards family, community and nation.

====Tudur Aled (c. 1465 – c. 1525)====
Tudur Aled was himself a nobleman and one of the greatest of the Poets of the Nobility. Born in Llansannan, Denbighshire, his most important patrons were the Salisbury family of Dyffryn Clwyd. He was one of the instigators of the Caerwys eisteddfod of 1523. In his final illness he took the habit of the Order of St. Francis and died in Carmarthen, where he was buried in the Brothers&#x27; Court. At his death the elegies his fellow poets wrote in his memory attested to his greatness as a poet. He was renowned as a praise poet of both secular and religious noblemen, and also reflects the changes at the beginning of the 16th century which were threatening the future of the bardic system.

====Gruffudd Hiraethog (d. 1564)====
A native of Llangollen, Gruffudd Hiraethog was one of the foremost poets of the 16th century to use the &quot;cywydd&quot;. Though he was a member of the medieval guild of poets and a notable upholder of that tradition, he was also closely associated with William Salesbury, Wales&#x27; leading Renaissance scholar. In fact one of the first Welsh literature to be published in print was Gruffudd&#x27;s collection of proverbs in 1547, &quot;Oll synnwyr pen Kembero ygyd&quot; (Modern Welsh spelling: &quot;Holl synnwyr pen Cymro i gyd&quot;; English:&quot;All the wisdom of a Welshman&#x27;s head (collected) together&quot;).

===Other voices in poetry 1300–1600===
Not all of the poetry which survives from this period belongs to the tradition of the praise poetry of the nobility. Some groups of poets and genres of poetry stood completely outside that tradition. Women seem to be totally excluded from the Welsh poetic guild, or Order of bards. But we do know that some women did master the Welsh poetic craft and wrote poetry at this time, but only the work of one woman has survived in significant numbers, that of Gwerful Mechain.

The prophetic poetry (Welsh: &quot;canu brud&quot;) was a means of reacting to and commenting upon political situations and happenings. This poetry is intentionally ambiguous and difficult to understand. But at its heart it prophesies victory for the Welsh over their enemies, the English. This poetry looked towards a man of destiny who would free them from their oppressors. With the victory of the &#x27;Welshman&#x27; Henry VII in 1485 at the battle of Bosworth the poets believed that the prophecies had been fulfilled and the tradition comes to an end. Satire poetry (Welsh: &quot;canu dychan&quot;) was part of the &#x27;official&#x27; poets&#x27; repertoire and sparingly used within the praise tradition to chastise a miserly patron. But it was in private poetic bouts with fellow poets that the satire tradition flourished.

==Welsh prose==

It is believed that the earliest written Welsh is a marginal note of some sixty-four words in &quot;Llyfr Teilo&quot; (&quot;The Book of St. Teilo&quot;), a gospel book originating in Llandeilo but now in the library of St. Chad&#x27;s Cathedral, Lichfield, and also known as the &quot;Lichfield Gospels&quot;, or, &quot;The Book of St. Chad&quot;. The marginal note, known from its opening (Latin) word as &quot;The Surexit memorandum&quot;, dates from the ninth century, or even earlier, and is a record of a legal case over land.

The native Welsh storyteller, known as the &quot;cyfarwydd&quot; (&quot;the one who knows&quot;) was an official of the court. He was expected to know the traditional knowledge and the tales. But the storytelling tradition was basically oral, and only a few remnants suggest the wealth of that tradition. Amongst the most important are &quot;Trioedd Ynys Prydain&quot;, or the Welsh Triads, a compendium of mnemonics for poets and storytellers. The stories that have survived are literary compositions based on oral tradition.

In the Middle Ages Welsh was used for all sorts of purposes and this is reflected in the type of prose materials that has survived from this period: original material and translations, tales and facts, religious and legal, history and medicine.

===Native Welsh tales, or, &quot;Mabinogion&quot;===
The name &quot;Mabinogion&quot; is a convenient label for a collection of tales preserved in two manuscripts known as the White Book of Rhydderch and the Red Book of Hergest. They are written in Middle Welsh, the common literary language between the end of the eleventh century and the fourteenth century. They include the four tales that form &quot;Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi&quot; (&quot;The Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot;):
*Pwyll prince of Dyfed;
*Branwen daughter of Llŷr;
*Manawydan son of Llŷr;
*Math son of Mathonwy.

Two are native tales embodying traditions about King Arthur:
*&quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; the earliest Arthurian tale in any language;
*&quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;.

Two more are native tales embodying traditions about the early history of Britain:
*&quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;;
*&quot;The Dream of Maxen&quot;.

The final three are the Arthurian Welsh Romances, showing the influence of French poet Chrétien de Troyes:
*&quot;Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain&quot;, from &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;;
*&quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;, from &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;;
*&quot;Peredur son of Efrog&quot;, from &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;.

===Native Welsh law===
Tradition holds that Hywel Dda summoned a conference at Whitland, Carmarthenshire, in about 945. At this conference Welsh law was codified and set down in writing for posterity. Since the earliest manuscripts containing these legal texts date from about two hundred and fifty years after the event they are probably not a record of what was codified there, if such a conference was even convened. In fact, until the annexation of Wales in 1536, native Welsh law grew and developed organically and for that reason many more copies of it have survived than of the native tales.

The use of Welsh for legal texts shows that it had the words and the technical terms with definite and exact meanings needed in such circumstances. It also shows that reading and writing Welsh was not confined to priests and monks, but that there were also lawyers &quot;whose skill is directed not to administrating the law (there were judges for that), but to writing it, to giving it permanence in words, to ordering words and sentences in such a way that what was stated should be quite clear&quot; (Thomas Parry (1955), p. 68).

===Religious texts===
The vast majority of Welsh religious texts from the Middle Ages are translations and mostly the works of unknown monks and priests. The works themselves reflect the tastes and fashions of Christendom at the time: apocryphal narratives, dreams or visions, theological treatises and exegesis, and mystical works.

====Lives of the saints====
About thirty lives of the saints, both native ones like Beuno, Curig, and Gwenfrewi and the more general such as the Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Martin of Tours, and Catherine of Alexandria survive, all translations into Welsh from Latin. Even the lives of the native saints were composed in Latin originally, and that a long time after the saint&#x27;s actual life and so of little or no interest to those looking for actual historical information. Perhaps the two most important is &quot;Buchedd Dewi&quot; (&quot;The life of Dewi, or, David&quot;) written by Rhygyfarch in about 1094, and &quot;Buchedd Cadog&quot; (&quot;Life of Cadog&quot;) written by Lifris of Llancarfan in c. 1100.

===History texts===
The Welsh medieval history texts belong to the class of literary creations, but the split into two distinct groups. While the first group, &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, tends to stick to historical facts, the second, &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, is the fantastic creation of Geoffrey of Monmouth.

====&quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;====
&quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Princes&quot;) consists of variant Welsh translations of Latin original &quot;annales&quot; telling the history of Wales from the seventh century to the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282. It is believed that the original and its translation were produced at the Cistercian Strata Florida Abbey.

====&quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;====
&quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Kings&quot;) is the name given to a number of texts that ultimately trace their origins back to translations of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s Historia Regum Britanniae (1136). As such they were key works in shaping how the Welsh thought of themselves and others, tracing their origins back to Brutus of Troy, the mythical founder of Britain. In fact the Welsh word &quot;brut&quot; is derived from Brutus&#x27;s name and originally meant &quot;a history of Brutus&quot; and then &quot;a chronicle history&quot;.

<text>Judy Blundell, pseudonym Jude Watson, is an American author of books for middle grade, young adult, and adult readers.
She won the annual National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature in 2008 for the young adult novel &quot;What I Saw and How I Lied&quot;, published under her real name by Scholastic Books.

== Life ==
Blundell is better known as Jude Watson, an author of books set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. Her publisher, Scholastic, calls her &quot;the most celebrated author in the prequel-era of the Star Wars phenomenon&quot; (that is, Star Wars fiction set in the time frame of the three prequel movies).

Writing for the Star Wars franchise, she worked with editors from LucasBooks as well as Scholastic. Her debut came when LucasBooks recruited her to write the Star Wars Journal &quot;Captive to Evil by Princess Leia Organa&quot;, published by Scholastic in 1998.

Beside the journals of Princess Leia, Queen Amidala (1999), and Darth Maul (1999), Watson is the author of three series that comprise about forty books: &quot;Jedi Apprentice&quot; (except for the first book), &quot;Jedi Quest&quot;, and &quot;The Last of the Jedi&quot;. She is also a co-author with K. D. Burkett in the &quot;Star Wars: Science Adventures&quot; series. Scholastic says that the primary audience is children age 9 to 14.

Her other books include the romance series &quot;Brides of Wildcat County&quot;, the parapsychic science fiction works &quot;Premonitions&quot; and &quot;Disappearance&quot;, and three books in the 39 Clues mystery-adventure series, all written for young adults. In 2018 she published the book &quot;A Warp in Time&quot;.

== Family ==
Blundell lives in a small village called Stony Brook, on Long Island, with her daughter and husband. Her husband, Neil Watson, is the Executive Director of the Long Island Museum of American Art, History, and Carriages.

<doc id="1206014" wikidata="Q1857902" url="?curid=1206014" title="Mushki">
<text>The Mushki (sometimes transliterated as Muški) were an Iron Age people of Anatolia who appear in sources from Assyria but not from the Hittites. Several authors have connected them with the Moschoi (Μόσχοι) of Greek sources and the Georgian tribe of the Meskhi. Josephus Flavius identified the &quot;Moschoi&quot; with the Biblical Meshech. Two different groups are called &quot;Muški&quot; in Assyrian sources (Diakonoff 1984:115), one from the 12th to the 9th centuries BC near the confluence of the Arsanias and the Euphrates (&quot;Eastern Mushki&quot;) and the other from the 8th to the 7th centuries BC in Cappadocia and Cilicia (&quot;Western Mushki&quot;). Assyrian sources clearly identify the Western Mushki with the Phrygians, but later Greek sources then distinguish between the Phrygians and the Moschoi.

Identification of the Eastern Mushki with the Western Mushki is uncertain, but it is possible that at least some of the Eastern Mushki migrated to Cilicia in the 10th to the 8th centuries BC. Although almost nothing is known about what language (or languages) the Eastern or Western Mushki spoke, they have been variously identified as being speakers of a Phrygian, Armenian, Anatolian, or Georgian language.

==Eastern Mushki==

The Eastern Mushki appear to have moved into Hatti in the 12th century BC, around the time that the Hittite Empire collapsed.

Together with the Urumu and Kaskas (Apishlu), they attempted to invade the Middle Assyrian Empire&#x27;s Anatolian provinces of Alzi (Alshe) and Puruhuzzi in about 1160 BC, but they were pushed back and subjugated by Ashur-Dan I. In 1115 BC, the Mushki advanced further, penetrating into Kadmuhi, along the Upper Tigris. After being turned away by Tiglath-pileser I, the Mushki apparently settled in Alzi.

Whether the Mushki initially moved into the core Hittite areas from the east or west has been a matter of some discussion by historians. It has been speculated that the Mushki were connected to the spread of the so-called Transcaucasian ceramic ware, which appeared as far west as modern Elazığ, Turkey in the late second millennium BC. This ceramic ware is believed to have been developed in the South Caucasus region, possibly by the Trialeti-Vanadzor culture originally, which suggests an eastern homeland for the Mushki.

==Western Mushki==
In the 8th century BC, Tabal became the most influential of the Neo-Hittite polities, and the Mushki under Mita entered an anti-Assyrian alliance with Tabal and Carchemish. The alliance was soon defeated by Sargon of Assyria, who captured Carchemish and drove back Mita to his own province. Ambaris of Tabal was diplomatically married to an Assyrian princess, and received the province of Hilakku under Assyrian dominion, but in 713 BC, Ambaris was deposed and Tabal became a fully fledged Assyrian province.

In 709 BC, the Mushki re-emerged as allies of Assyria, Sargon naming Mita as his friend. It appears that Mita had captured and handed over to the Assyrians emissaries of Urikki, king of Que, who were sent to negotiate an anti-Assyrian contract with Urartu, as they passed through his territory.

According to Assyrian military intelligence reports to Sargon recorded on clay tablets found in the Royal Archives of Nineveh by Sir Henry Layard, the Cimmerians invaded Urartu from Mannai in 714 BC. From there they turned west along the coast of the Black Sea as far as Sinope, and then headed south towards Tabal, in 705 BC campaigning against an Assyrian army in central Anatolia, resulting in the death of Sargon II, although they were cleared from Assyrian ruled territory. Macqueen (1986:157) and others have speculated that the Mushki under Mita may have participated in the Assyrian campaign and were forced to flee to western Anatolia, disappearing from Assyrian accounts, but entering the periphery of Greek historiography as king Midas of Phrygia.

Rusas II of Urartu in the 7th century BC fought the &quot;Mushki-ni&quot; to his west, before he entered an alliance with them against Assyria. 

Some scholars have speculated that the Western Mushki were not Phrygians, but they conquered the Phrygians, or were conquered by the Phrygians, and the two became conflated with one another.

==Hypothesized relations with modern Transcaucasian peoples==

===Mushki and Armenians===
According to Igor Diakonoff, the Mushki were a Thraco-Phrygian group who carried their Proto-Armenian language from the Balkans across Asia Minor, mixing with Hurrians (and Urartians) and Luwians along the way. Diakonoff theorized that the root of the name Mushki was &quot;Mush&quot; (or perhaps &quot;Mus,&quot; &quot;Mos,&quot; or &quot;Mosh&quot;) with the addition of the Armenian plural suffix &quot;-k&quot;&#x27;.
Armen Petrosyan clarifies this, suggesting that &quot;-ki&quot; was a Proto-Armenian form of the Classical Armenian &quot;-k&quot;&#x27; (compare to Ancient Greek -κοί) and etymologizes &quot;Mush&quot; as meaning &quot;worker&quot; or &quot;agriculturalist.&quot;

Some have placed (at least the Eastern) Mushki homeland in the Armenian Highlands and South Caucasus region. It is possible that at least some of the Mushki were Armenian-speakers or speakers of a closely related language.

Pliny in the 1st century AD mentions the &quot;Moscheni&quot; in southern Armenia (&quot;Armenia&quot; at the time stretching south and west to the Mediterranean, bordering on Cappadocia). In Byzantine historiography, Moschoi was a name equivalent to or considered as the ancestors of &quot;Cappadocians&quot; (Eusebius) with their capital at Mazaca (later Caesarea Mazaca, modern Develi, Kayseri). According to Armenian tradition, the city of Mazaca was founded by and named after Mishak (Misak, Moshok), a cousin and general of the legendary patriarch Aram. Scholars have proposed a connection between the name Mishak and Mushki.

The Armenian region of Mokk&#x27; and the city of Mush (Muş) may derive their names from the Mushki.

According to Professor James R. Russell of Harvard University, the Georgian designation for Armenians, &quot;Somekhi&quot;, refers to the Mushki.

However, the connection between the Mushki and Armenian languages is quite unclear and many modern scholars have rejected a direct linguistic relationship if the Mushki were Phrygian speakers. Additionally, genetic research does not support significant admixture into the Armenian nation after 1200 BC, making the Mushki, if they indeed migrated from a Balkan or western Anatolian homeland during or after the Bronze Age Collapse, unlikely candidates for the Proto-Armenians.

===Mushki and Georgians===
Some Georgian historians have proposed that the Mushki, together with other ancient tribes of Asia Minor mentioned in Assyrian sources (such as the Tibal and others), were &quot;proto-Georgian&quot; tribes, which contributed to the formation of the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Iberia.

According to Donald Rayfield, Mushki, Moschoi, and Meskhi are floating names. He argues the Mushki may have worshiped the Hittite moon god Arma and the Luwian god Santush (Santa/Sandan), comparing these names to the phonetically similar pagan Iberian gods Armazi and Zaden, whose idols were overthrown by Christian missionaries in the 4th century AD in Iberia. Rayfield&#x27;s theories are speculative, however, and nothing is actually known of the Mushki&#x27;s religious convictions.

==Moschoi==
Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 550 – 476 BC) speaks of the Moschi as &quot;Colchians&quot;, situated next to the Matieni.

According to Herodotus, the equipment of the Moschoi was similar to that of the Tibareni, Macrones, Mossynoeci and Mardae, with wooden caps upon their heads, and shields and small spears, on which long points were set. All these tribes formed the 19th satrapy of the Achaemenid empire, extending along the southeast of the Euxine, or the Black Sea, and bounded on the south by the lofty chain of the Armenian mountains.

Strabo locates the Moschoi in two places. The first location is somewhere in modern Abkhazia on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, in agreement with Stephan of Byzantium quoting Hellanicus. The second location &quot;Moschice&quot; (&quot;Moschikê&quot;) – in which was a temple of Leucothea, once famous for its wealth, but plundered by Pharnaces and Mithridates – was divided between the Colchians, Armenians, and Iberians (cf. Mela, III. 5.4; Pliny VI.4.). These latter Moschoi were obviously Meskhi or Mesx’i (where Greek χ, chi, is Georgian ხ, x), located in southern Georgia. Procopius calls them Meschoi and says that they were subject to the Iberians (i.e., Georgians), and had embraced Christianity, the religion of their masters.

==Biblical Meshech==

Josephus Flavius identified the Cappadocian &quot;Moschoi&quot; with the Biblical Japhetic tribe descended from Meshech in his writings on the Genealogy of the Nations in Genesis 10, while Hippolytus of Rome connected Meshech with Illyrians. Meshech is named with Tubal as a principality of the prince of Gog and Magog in Ezekiel 38:2 and 39:1.
