<text>William Winter (11 September 1897 – 18 December 1955) was a British chess player. He won the British Open Chess Championship in 1934 and the British Chess Championship in 1935 and 1936. An acolyte of Siegbert Tarrasch, his sound, strategic play enabled him to defeat a number of the world&#x27;s top players, including David Bronstein, Aron Nimzowitsch and Milan Vidmar. However, his health and tactical play were insufficiently strong to enable him to repeat these victories on a consistent basis.

==Life and career==
Winter was a widely respected author of chess books and was a nephew of J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan. Winter was also a Communist. His over-the-board and real-life characters were in stark contrast to each other. Harry Golombek described his play as &quot;classic, scientific and sober; away from the board, he was revolutionary, illogically moved by his emotions (he contrived to be both a fervent communist and a staunch patriot) and, more often than not, drunk.&quot;

Winter has the distinction of being the only British Champion to have served time in prison (for his political activities). His memoirs were serialised in &quot;CHESS magazine&quot; in the late 1950s.

Due to the outbreak of World War I, he had to break and then resume his law studies. During his time there, he was the champion of Cambridge University.

Winter played in four Olympiads, in 1930, 1931, 1933, and 1935.

<doc id="1221167" wikidata="Q596340" url="?curid=1221167" title="1080° Avalanche">
<text>1080° Avalanche is a snowboarding video game developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It was released on November 28, 2003, in Europe, on December 1, 2003, in North America, and on January 22, 2004, in Japan. &quot;Avalanche&quot; is a sequel to the 1998 video game &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; for the Nintendo 64.

In contrast to similar snowboarding games such as the &quot;SSX&quot; series, the game emphasizes more on downhill racing than stunts and tricks. Gameplay can output in 480p and Dolby Pro Logic II and supports four players on one GameCube as well as LAN play with up to four GameCubes.

==Gameplay==
Similar to &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot;, gameplay focuses on racing more than performing stunts. There are differences between this game and &quot;Snowboarding&quot;, with one being the &quot;Avalanche&quot; - the final event of every Match Race challenge is a daredevil run through an avalanche-prone trail where the player has to outrun an avalanche that starts in the middle of the run or even at the very start. In over 20 courses, the players can compete in the main Match mode, along with Trick Attack, Time Trial and Gate modes.

Unlike the first game, each rider has unique boards, and up to three new boards for each character can be unlocked along with bonus boards, which are surreal objects replacing the snowboard, such as a penguin or a NES controller.

==Development and release==
Shortly after the release of &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; (1998), Nintendo announced that Left Field Productions was taking over development for a sequel title on the Nintendo 64. Pre-production planning was done on the game, but it was cancelled early on in favor of moving development to the then-upcoming GameCube platform. When Left Field later ended their exclusivity contract with Nintendo, their work was returned to Nintendo, and the game was reworked internally by Nintendo to release as &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot; (2003) for the GameCube. Development of the game was handed to Nintendo&#x27;s American development studio, Nintendo Software Technology Corporation (NST).

&quot;1080°: Avalanche&quot; was released in both single-disc and double-disc versions. The second disc is a standard miniDVD featuring a half-hour of snowboarding footage alongside gameplay footage set to soundtracks from the game. This version was exclusively available at Walmart and can be differentiated by the presence of a red sash on the front cover.

==Reception==

It received a score of 7.5/7/5.5 from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. Dan Hsu, the first reviewer, found fault with the game&#x27;s trick system, while the third reviewer Shawn Elliott severely criticised it, who believed that &quot;Avalanche&quot; can&#x27;t compete with &quot;SSX 3&quot;.

<doc id="1221168" wikidata="Q899181" url="?curid=1221168" title="Hydroformylation">
<text>In organic chemistry, hydroformylation, also known as oxo synthesis or oxo process, is an industrial process for the production of aldehydes () from alkenes (). This chemical reaction entails the net addition of a formyl group () and a hydrogen atom to a carbon-carbon double bond. This process has undergone continuous growth since its invention: production capacity reached 6.6 tons in 1995. It is important because aldehydes are easily converted into many secondary products. For example, the resultant aldehydes are hydrogenated to alcohols that are converted to detergents. Hydroformylation is also used in speciality chemicals, relevant to the organic synthesis of fragrances and pharmaceuticals. The development of hydroformylation is one of the premier achievements of 20th-century industrial chemistry.

The process entails treatment of an alkene typically with high pressures (between 10 and 100 atmospheres) of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at temperatures between 40 and 200 °C. In one variation, formaldehyde is used in place of synthesis gas. Transition metal catalysts are required. Invariably, the catalyst dissolves in the reaction medium, i.e. hydroformylation is an example of homogeneous catalysis.

==History==
The process was discovered by the German chemist Otto Roelen in 1938 in the course of investigations of the Fischer–Tropsch process. Aldehydes and diethylketone were obtained when ethylene was added to an F-T reactor. Through these studies, Roelen discovered the utility of cobalt catalysts. HCo(CO)4, which had been isolated only a few years prior to Roelen&#x27;s work, was shown to be an excellent catalyst. The term oxo synthesis was coined by the Ruhrchemie patent department, who expected the process to be applicable to the preparation of both aldehydes and ketones. Subsequent work demonstrated that the ligand tributylphosphine (PBu3) improved the selectivity of the cobalt-catalysed process. The mechanism of Co-catalyzed hydroformylation was elucidated by Richard F. Heck and David Breslow in the 1960s.
In 1968, highly active rhodium-based catalysts were reported. Since the 1970s, most hydroformylation relies on catalysts based on rhodium. Water-soluble catalysts have been developed. They facilitate the separation of the products from the catalyst.

==Mechanism==

===Selectivity===
A key consideration of hydroformylation is the &quot;normal&quot; vs. &quot;iso&quot; selectivity. For example, the hydroformylation of propylene can afford two isomeric products, butyraldehyde or isobutyraldehyde:

:formula_1

These isomers reflect the regiochemistry of the insertion of the alkene into the M–H bond. Since both products are not equally desirable (normal is more stable than iso), much research was dedicated to the quest for catalyst that favored the normal isomer.

=== Steric effects ===
Markovnikov&#x27;s rule addition of the cobalt hydride to primary alkenes is disfavored by steric hindrance between the cobalt centre and the secondary alkyl ligand. Bulky ligands exacerbate this steric hindrance. Hence, the mixed carbonyl/phosphine complexes offer a greater selectivity for anti-Markovnikov addition, thus favoring straight chain products (&quot;n&quot;-) aldehydes. Modern catalysts rely increasingly on chelating ligands, especially diphosphites.

=== Electronic effects ===
Additionally, electron-rich the hydride complex are less proton-like. Thus, as a result, the electronic effects that normally favour the Markovnikov addition to an alkene are less applicable. Thus, electron-rich hydrides are more selective.

===Acyl formation===
To suppress competing isomerization of the alkene, the rate of migratory insertion of the carbonyl into the carbon-metal bond of the alkyl must be relatively fast. The rate of insertion of the carbonyl carbon into the C-M bond is likely to be greater than the rate of beta-hydride elimination.
==Asymmetric hydroformylation==
Hydroformylation of prochiral alkenes creates new stereocenters. Using chiral phosphine ligands, the hydroformylation can be tailored to favor one enantiomer. Thus, for example, dexibuprofen, the (+)−(&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer of ibuprofen, can be produced by enantioselective hydroformylation followed by oxidation.

== Processes ==
The industrial processes vary depending on the chain length of the olefin to be hydroformylated, the catalyst metal and ligands, and the recovery of the catalyst. The original Ruhrchemie process produced propanal from ethene and syngas using cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride. Today, industrial processes based on cobalt catalysts are mainly used for the production of medium- to long-chain olefins, whereas the rhodium-based catalysts are usually used for the hydroformylation of propene. The rhodium catalysts are significantly more expensive than cobalt catalysts. In the hydroformylation of higher molecular weight olefins the separation of the catalyst from the produced aldehydes is difficult.

=== BASF-oxo process ===
The BASF-oxo process starts mostly with higher olefins and relies on cobalt carbonyl-based catalyst. By conducting the reaction at low temperatures, one observes increased selectivity favoring the linear product. The process is carried out at a pressure of about 30 MPa and in a temperature range of 150 to 170 °C. The cobalt is recovered from the liquid product by oxidation to water-soluble Co2 +, followed by the addition of aqueous formic or acetic acids. This process gives an aqueous phase of cobalt, which can then be recycled. Losses are compensated by the addition of cobalt salts.

=== Exxon process ===
The Exxon process, also Kuhlmann- or PCUK – oxo process, is used for the hydroformylation of C6–C12 olefins. The process relies on cobalt catalysts. In order to recover the catalyst, an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution or sodium carbonate is added to the organic phase. By extraction with olefin and neutralization by addition of sulfuric acid solution under carbon monoxide pressure the metal carbonyl hydride can recovered. This is stripped out with syngas, absorbed by the olefin, and returned to the reactor. Similar to the BASF process, the Exxon process is carried out at a pressure of about 30 MPa and at a temperature of about 160 to 180 °C.

=== Shell process ===
The Shell process uses cobalt complexes modified with phosphine ligands for the hydroformylation of C7–C14 olefins. The resulting aldehydes are directly hydrogenated to the fatty alcohols, which are separated by distillation, which allows the catalyst to be recycled. The process has good selectivity to linear products, which find use as feedstock for detergents. The process is carried out at a pressure of about 4 to 8 MPa and at a temperature range of about 150–190 °C.

=== Union Carbide process ===
The Union Carbide (UCC) process, also known as low-pressure oxo process (LPO), relies on a rhodium catalyst dissolved in high-boiling thick oil, a higher molecular weight condensation product of the primary aldehydes, for the hydroformylation of propene. The reaction mixture is separated in a falling film evaporator from volatile components. The liquid phase is distilled and butyraldehyde is removed as head product while the catalyst containing bottom product is recycled to the process. The process is carried out at about 1.8 MPa and 95–100 °C.

=== Ruhrchemie/Rhone–Poulenc process ===

The Ruhrchemie/Rhone–Poulenc process (RCRPP) relies on a rhodium catalyst with water-soluble TPPTS as ligand (Kuntz Cornils catalyst) for the hydroformylation of propene. The tri-sulfonation of triphenylphosphane ligand provides hydrophilic properties to the organometallic complex. The catalyst complex carries nine sulfonate-groups and is highly soluble in water (about 1 kg L−1), but not in the emerging product phase. The water-soluble TPPTS is used in about 50-fold excess, whereby the leaching of the catalyst is effectively suppressed. Reactants are propene and syngas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in a ratio of 1.1:1. A mixture of butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde in the ratio 96:4 is generated with few by-products such as alcohols, esters and higher boiling fractions. The Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc-process is the first commercially available two-phase system in which the catalyst is present in the aqueous phase. 
In the progress of the reaction an organic product phase is formed which is separated continuously by means of phase separation, wherein the aqueous catalyst phase remains in the reactor.

The process is carried out in a stirred tank reactor where the olefin and the syngas are entrained from the bottom of the reactor through the catalyst phase under intensive stirring. The resulting crude aldehyde phase is separated at the top from the aqueous phase. The aqueous catalyst-containing solution is re-heated via a heat exchanger and pumped back into the reactor. The excess olefin and syngas is separated from the aldehyde phase in a stripper and fed back to the reactor. The generated heat is used for the generation of process steam, which is used for subsequent distillation of the organic phase to separate into butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde. Potential catalyst poisons coming from the synthesis gas migrate into the organic phase and removed from the reaction with the aldehyde. Thus, poisons do not accumulate, and the elaborate fine purification of the syngas can be omitted.

A plant was built in Oberhausen in 1984, which was debottlenecked in 1988 and again in 1998 up to a production capacity of 500,000 t/a butanal. The conversion rate of propene is 98% and the selectivity to n-butanal is high. During the life time of a catalyst batch in the process less than 1 ppb rhodium is lost.

===Laboratory process===
Recipes have been developed for the hydroformylation on a laboratory scale, e.g. of cyclohexene.

==Substrates other than alkenes==
Cobalt carbonyl and rhodium complexes catalyse the hydroformylation of formaldehyde and ethylene oxide to give hydroxyacetaldehyde and 3-hydroxypropanal, which can then be hydrogenated to ethylene glycol and propane-1,3-diol, respectively. The reactions work best when the solvent is basic (such as pyridine).

In the case of dicobalt octacarbonyl or Co2(CO)8 as a catalyst, pentan-3-one can arise from ethene and CO, in the absence of hydrogen. A proposed intermediate is the ethylene-propionyl species [CH3C(O)Co(CO)3(ethene)] which undergoes a migratory insertion to form [CH3COCH2CH2Co(CO)3]. The required hydrogen arises from the water shift reaction. For details, see

If the water shift reaction is not operative, the reaction affords a polymer containing alternating carbon monoxide and ethylene units. Such aliphatic polyketones are more conventionally prepared using palladium catalysts.

Functionalized olefins such as allyl alcohol can be hydroformylated. The target product 1,4-butanediol and its isomer is obtained with isomerization free catalysts such as rhodium-triphenylphosphine complexes. The use of the cobalt complex leads by isomerization of the double bond to n-propanal. The hydroformylation of alkenyl ethers and alkenyl esters occurs usually in the α-position to the ether or ester function.

The hydroformylation of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid in the rhodium-catalyzed process leads to the Markovnikov product in the first step. By variation of the reaction conditions the reaction can be directed to different products. A high reaction temperature and low carbon monoxide pressure favors the isomerization of the Markovnikov product to the thermodynamically more stable β-isomer, which leads to the n-aldehyde. Low temperatures and high carbon monoxide pressure and an excess of phosphine, which blocks free coordination sites, can lead to faster hydroformylation in the α-position to the ester group and suppress the isomerization.

== Side- and consecutive reactions ==

=== Tandem carbonylation-water gas shift reactions ===
Side reactions of the alkenes are the isomerization and hydrogenation of the double bond. While the alkanes resulting from hydrogenation of the double bond do not participate further in the reaction, the isomerization of the double bond with subsequent formation of the n-alkyl complexes is a desired reaction. The hydrogenation is usually of minor importance; However, cobalt-phosphine-modified catalysts can have an increased hydrogenation activity, where up to 15% of the alkene is hydrogenated.

=== Tandem hydroformylation-hydrogenation ===
Using tandem catalysis, systems have been developed for the one-pot conversion of akenes to alcohols. The first step is hydroformylation.

=== Ligand degradation ===
Conditions for hydroformylation catalysis can induce degradation of supporting organophosphorus ligands. Triphenylphosphine is subject to hydrogenolysis, releasing benzene and diphenylphosphine. The insertion of carbon monoxide in an intermediate metal-phenyl bond can lead to the formation of benzaldehyde or by subsequent hydrogenation to benzyl alcohol. One of the ligands phenyl-groups can be replaced by propene, and the resulting diphenylpropylphosphine ligand can inhibit the hydroformylation reaction due to its increased basicity.

==Metals==
Although the original hydroformylation catalysts were based on cobalt, most modern processes rely on rhodium, which is expensive. There has therefore been interest in finding alternative metal catalysts. Examples of alternative metals include iron and ruthenium.

<doc id="1221174" wikidata="Q3351634" url="?curid=1221174" title="Olympia and York">
<text>Olympia &amp; York (also spelled as Olympia and York, abbreviated as O&amp;Y) was a major international property development firm based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The firm built major financial office complexes including Canary Wharf in London, the World Financial Center in New York City, and First Canadian Place in Toronto. It went bankrupt in the early 1990s and was recreated to eventually become Olympia &amp; York Properties.

==History==
===Early years===
The company was founded by Paul Reichmann and his brothers, Albert and Ralph, in Toronto in the early 1950s as an outgrowth of their Olympia Flooring and Tile Company. It first built and operated warehouses and other commercial buildings in Toronto. Its first major project was the development of the vast Flemingdon Park project on Don Mills Road.

The company then took a major gamble, winning the fierce bidding war for the final undeveloped property at the corner of King and Bay street (the geographic heart of Canada&#x27;s financial district). The Reichmans won the contract to build Canada&#x27;s tallest building, First Canadian Place in 1971. The project almost collapsed, however, when reformist mayor David Crombie put a halt to major development projects. After three years of lobbying, the project finally went ahead, to great success. 

===The Golden 80s===
In the 1980s, Olympia &amp; York grew to be the largest property development firm in the world. In the early 1980s the New York City real estate market was severely depressed, and the Reichmanns bought a group of nine skyscrapers for the low price of $300 million. In only a few years the group rose in value to $3.5 billion. The company became centred on New York, opening an office on Park Avenue. The company won the rights to the largest development project in the city when they were awarded the contract to develop the Battery Park City neighborhood next to the World Trade Center. This project became the World Financial Center and was another great success for the firm.

In 1980, they had also acquired English Property Corp, one of the largest British developers. 
That led the company to undertake development of the Canary Wharf site in the east of London. The 83-acre (336,000 m2) site would become the largest development project in the world, which would incorporate One Canada Square, Britain&#x27;s tallest skyscraper at the time. The project ran into problems, however. Britain entered a recession, British firms were unwilling to relocate from the traditional financial centre within the City of London, and despite a personal promise by Margaret Thatcher, the London Underground line known as the Jubilee Line Extension was delayed in construction awaiting the contributions from Olympia &amp; York (with the line eventually opening in the year 2000). The office space at Canary Wharf remained largely empty, and Olympia &amp; York began to run out of cash. At the same time, New York City and its real estate market began a deep recession, and Olympia &amp; York, which was now the largest property holder in Manhattan, began to feel cash flow problems which deeply affected the pyramid-like financing strategy that the Reichmann brothers had adopted.

As well, they held a significant shareholding in the Royal Trustco.

Both Reichmann brothers were strongly religious Haredi Jews, and shut down their construction sites for the Jewish Sabbath and for all Jewish holidays. Even while the success of O&amp;Y made them one of the world&#x27;s richest families, they continued to live relatively austere lives.

The company diversified through the 1980s. The firm acquired a 50.1% control of Brinco Ltd. in 1980. In 1981, the company acquired an 82% controlling interest in Abitibi-Price Inc. In 1985 the company bought Gulf Canada, a deal that attracted much controversy because it earned the company multimillion-dollar tax breaks. Following a highly publicized legal battle with Britain&#x27;s Allied Lyons PLC for control of Canadian-based distillers Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Distillery, the makers of the popular Canadian Club brand of rye whiskey, in 1987 Olympia &amp; York became Allied Lyons&#x27; largest shareholder.

===Bankruptcy===
In March 1992, Paul Reichmann was forced to resign as president. In May, the company filed for bankruptcy and it owed over 20 billion dollars to various banks and investors. The company was finally dismembered in February 1993, and the Reichmanns were left with only a small rump known as Olympia &amp; York Properties Corporation. The new company has again grown into a multibillion-dollar firm, including retaining a large stake of the now prosperous Canary Wharf project. However, they no longer have large holdings in New York City. Many of the NYC properties are now under Brookfield Properties.

==O&amp;Y Properties Corporation and O&amp;Y Real Estate Investment Trust==

Olympia &amp; York Properties Corporation and O&amp;Y REIT returned to the real estate market in Canada, owning 18 properties in six Canadian cities. In 2005 the family sold these two real estate arms to revive Brookfield Properties for $2.1 billion.

<doc id="1221178" wikidata="Q7084648" url="?curid=1221178" title="Old Oaken Bucket">
<text>The Old Oaken Bucket is a traveling trophy awarded in American college football as part of the rivalry between the Indiana Hoosiers football team of Indiana University and Purdue Boilermakers football team of Purdue University. It was first awarded in 1925.

Indiana and Purdue first met on the gridiron in 1891. The rivalry has been renewed annually in peacetime with some exceptions. Purdue leads the overall series 77–43–6. 

==History of the Trophy==
The concept of a trophy for football games played annually between Purdue University and Indiana University was first proposed during a joint meeting of the Chicago chapters of the Indiana and Purdue alumni organizations in 1925:

:&quot;discuss the possibility of undertaking worthy joint enterprises in behalf of the two schools.&quot;

During that meeting Indiana alumnus Dr. Clarence Jones and Purdue alumnus Russel Gray were appointed to propose a suitable trophy. At a subsequent meeting in Chicago Jones and Gray recommended some oaken bucket be that trophy and the chapters drafted the resolution that:

:&quot;an old oaken bucket as the most typical Hoosier form of trophy, that the bucket should be taken from some well in Indiana, and that a chain to be made of bronze block &quot;I&quot; and &quot;P&quot; letters should be provided for the bucket. The school winning the traditional football game each year should have possession of the &quot;Old Oaken Bucket&quot; until the next game and should attach the block letter representing the winning school to the bail with the score engraved on the latter link.&quot;

Purdue alumnus Fritz Ernst and Indiana alumnus Whiley J. Huddle were appointed to find a suitable oak bucket. They found such a bucket at the then Bruner family farm between Kent and Hanover in southern Indiana. Although the bucket might have been used at an open well on the Bruner family farm that had been settled during the 1840s, the Bruner family lore indicates that the bucket might have been used by General John Hunt Morgan and his &quot;Raiders&quot; during their jaunt through southeastern Indiana during the Civil War.

In accordance with the Chicago alumni organization&#x27;s resolution, the winner of the bucket gets a &quot;P&quot; or &quot;I&quot; link added to the chain of the bucket with the score, date and the city where the game was played engraved on the link. In case of a tie, an &quot;I–P&quot; link was added. The inaugural Old Oaken Bucket Game ended in a 0–0 deadlock on November 21, 1925, in Bloomington resulting in the first and most visible link, an &quot;I–P&quot; link, being added to the handle of the bucket.

When Indiana and Purdue moved to separate divisions for the 2014 season—Indiana to the East and Purdue to the West—the Old Oaken Bucket was the only inter-divisional rivalry protected under the new alignment.

==The poem &quot;The Old Oaken Bucket&quot;==
The name of the trophy refers to a sentimental poem written in 1817 by a successful printer and publisher, Samuel Woodworth (1784–1842) which begins:
:&quot;How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,
:When fond recollection presents them to view!
:The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood,
:And every loved spot which my infancy knew!

:...And e&#x27;en the rude bucket that hung in the well—
:The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
:The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.&quot;

Although Samuel Woodworth was not from Indiana, the poem exemplifies the sentiment felt by the people of Indiana towards their home state. The poem was set to music in 1826 by G. F. Kiallmark (1804–1887) and memorized or sung by generations of American schoolchildren; it made the poet&#x27;s unpretentious childhood home in Scituate, Massachusetts, the goal of sentimental tourists in the late 19th century.

Bing Crosby recorded a musical version of the poem on a Decca record on June 14, 1941, with John Scott Trotter and His Orchestra.

==Series statistics==

==Game results==
The 1903 contest, scheduled to be played on October 31 at Washington Park in Indianapolis, Indiana, was canceled after one of the trains carrying the Purdue football team collided with a coal train near 18th Street on the north side of Indianapolis. In all, 17 Purdue football players, coaches, alumni, and team supporters were killed in the Purdue Wreck. The 2020 contest was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic: Indiana was ranked #12 at the time, Purdue was unranked, and the Hoosiers were the favorites coming into the game.

<text>Sir James Robert Dickson, (30 November 183210 January 1901) was an Australian politician and businessman, the 13th Premier of Queensland and a member of the first federal ministry.

==Early life==
Dickson was born on 30 November 1832 in Plymouth, Devon, England. He was the only son of Mary Maria (née Palmer) and James Dickson. He was educated in Scotland at the High School of Glasgow, and subsequently worked as a junior clerk at the City of Glasgow Bank. Dickson arrived in Australia in 1854 during the Victorian gold rush. He initially worked for the Bank of Australasia and then for Rae, Dickson &amp; Co., his cousin&#x27;s merchant firm. He moved to the Colony of Queensland in 1862, working for an estate agent for a period and then establishing himself as an auctioneer and land agent. He built Toorak House, a villa overlooking the Brisbane River.

==Colonial politics==

Dickson was elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Enoggera in 1873. He was made Secretary for Public Works and Mines in 1876 under Arthur Macalister, and was Treasurer 1876–79. In the absence of Sir Samuel Griffith he was briefly Opposition Leader, and was Treasurer again 1883–87 after Griffith became Premier. He lost his seat in 1888 but was again elected for Bulimba in 1892, supporting the importation of labourers from the South Pacific to work on the Queensland canefields.

In the so-called Continuous Ministry of the late 1890s, Dickson attained the positions of Secretary for Railways in 1897, Postmaster-General and Home Secretary 1898–99. In September 1898, after the death of Thomas Byrnes he was made Premier. The Continuous Ministry by this stage was falling apart, and Dickson had only a brief period in office before Anderson Dawson gained the support of the Legislative Assembly to become the leader of the world&#x27;s first Labour Party government. The Ministerialists regrouped a week later to vote Dawson out of office. Dickson lacked support to become Premier again, and that position instead went to Robert Philp, in whose government Dickson was Chief Secretary.

==Federal politics and death==

Dickson was a leading supporter of federation in Queensland and was mainly responsible for winning a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the Queensland referendum on the proposed Constitution of Australia in 1900. As a result, Dickson was appointed Minister for Defence in the first federal ministry under Edmund Barton on 1 January 1901. He was intending to stand for election to the first Federal Parliament, but on 10 January he died after being taken ill at the Commonwealth&#x27;s inaugural ceremonies in Sydney on 1 January. He was the first federal Minister to die in office.

He was accorded a state funeral; it proceeded from Toorak, his residence at Hamilton, to the All Saints Anglican Church. After a short service it moved on to the Nundah Cemetery.

==Honours==

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in November 1891. Only nine days before he died, Dickson was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the New Years Honours List 1 January 1901, &quot;in recognition of services in connection with the Federation of Australian Colonies and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;. The federal electoral division of Dickson in Queensland, and the Canberra suburb of Dickson are named after him.

<text>Arthur Twining Hadley (, ; April 23, 1856 – March 6, 1930) was an American economist who served as President of Yale University from 1899 to 1921.

==Biography==
Hadley was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of James Hadley, Professor of Greek at Yale 1851–1872, and his wife, née Anne Loring Morris. He graduated from Yale College in 1876, where he was a member of DKE and Skull and Bones, and received prizes in English, classics and astronomy. He then studied political science at Yale (1876–1877), and at the University of Berlin (1878–1879) under Adolph Wagner. He was a tutor at Yale in 1879–1883, instructor in political science in 1883–1886, professor of political science in 1886–1891, professor of political economy in 1891–1899, and first Dean of the Graduate School in 1892–1895. His course in economics became a favorite of undergraduates, and he wrote a classic study of the economics of railroad transportation. He became president of Yale in 1899—the first president who was not a minister—and guided it through a period of expansion and consolidation.
He was commissioner of the Connecticut bureau of labor statistics in 1885–1887. As an economist he first became widely known through his investigation of the railway question and his study of railway rates, which antedated the popular excitement as to rebates. His &quot;Railroad Transportation, Its History and Laws&quot; (1885) became a standard work, and appeared in Russian (1886) and French (1887). He testified as an expert on transportation before the Senate committee which drew up the Interstate Commerce Law, and wrote on railways and transportation for the Ninth and Tenth Editions (of which he was one of the editors) of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He wrote for Lalor&#x27;s &quot;Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and the Political History of the United States&quot; (3 vols., 1881–1884), for &quot;The American Railway&quot; (1888), and for &quot;The Railroad Gazette&quot; in 1884–1891, and for other periodicals. His idea of the broad scope of economic science, especially of the place of ethics in relation to political economy and business, is expressed in his writings and public addresses. In 1907–1908 he was Theodore Roosevelt Professor of American History and Institutions at Frederick William University. In 1902, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. He was an early member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

He was elected a director of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1913. In 1914 he lectured at the University of Oxford on “Institutions of the United States.” In 1915 he evoked considerable discussion in the United States by declaring that young men who looked forward to a political career should have private means so as to avoid pecuniary temptations. In 1915 he endorsed college military camps and favored counting military training for a degree.

After his retirement, he and his wife went on a world cruise, visiting Europe, India, and China. As the ship was approaching Japan, Hadley contracted pneumonia and died on shipboard, and the body was prepared in Japan for return to New Haven and interment in Grove Street Cemetery. When the coffin was opened prior to burial, Hadley was clothed in a yellow Japanese kimono with a samurai sword placed alongside.

Grove Street Cemetery&#x27;s Egyptian Revival gateway is inscribed &quot;The Dead Shall Be Raised&quot;, and most Yale presidents since it was built—and Hadley was no exception—have at some point quipped that the dead would most certainly be raised if Yale needs the land. Most are now buried there.

==Works==
In his books, he endeavored to utilize the results of economic and political history as a basis for a working system of ethics for a democracy like that of the United States. Among his works are:
*&quot;Railroad Transportation, Its History and Laws&quot; (see notice above; 1885)
*&quot;Report on the Labor Question&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Economics, an Account of the Relations between Private Property and Public Welfare&quot; (1896)
*&quot;The Education of the American Citizen&quot; (1901)
*&quot;Freedom and Responsibility&quot; (1903)
*&quot;Baccalaureate Addresses&quot; (1907)
*&quot;Standards of Public Morality&quot; (1907)
*&quot;Some Influences in Modern Philosophic Thought&quot; (1913)
*&quot;Undercurrents in American Politics&quot; (1915)
*&quot;The Moral Basis of Democracy&quot; (1919)

== Arthur Twining Hadley Prize ==
An annual tradition during Yale College Class Day, the Arthur Twining Hadley Prize is &quot;awarded to the graduating senior majoring in the social sciences who ranks highest in scholarship.&quot; Recipients of this award include Jennifer Nou and Andrew Klaber. 

==Personal life==
He married Helen Harrison Morris on June 30, 1891, daughter of Luzon Buritt Morris, who was to become Governor of Connecticut in 1893. They had two sons, Morris and Hamilton, and one daughter, Laura.

<doc id="1221192" wikidata="Q666985" url="?curid=1221192" title="Sincerity">
<text>Sincerity is the virtue of one who communicates and acts in accordance with the entirety of their feelings, beliefs, thoughts, and desires in a manner that is honest and genuine. Sincerity in one&#x27;s actions (as opposed to one&#x27;s communications) may be called &quot;earnestness&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The Oxford English Dictionary and most scholars state that &quot;sincerity&quot; from &quot;sincere&quot; is derived from the Latin meaning &quot;clean, pure, sound&quot;. may have once meant &quot;one growth&quot; (not mixed), from (one) and (to grow). is cognate with &quot;Ceres,&quot; the goddess of grain, as in &quot;cereal&quot;.

According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the Latin word is derived from the Indo-European root , itself derived from the zero-grade of (&quot;one&quot;) and the suffixed, lengthened e-grade of (&quot;grow&quot;), generating the underlying meaning &quot;of one growth&quot;, hence &quot;pure, clean&quot;.

=== Controversy ===
An often repeated folk etymology proposes that &quot;sincere&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;without&quot; and &quot;wax&quot;. According to one popular explanation, dishonest sculptors in Rome or Greece would cover flaws in their work with wax to deceive the viewer; therefore, a sculpture &quot;without wax&quot; would be one that was honestly represented. It has been said, &quot;One spoke of sincere wine... simply to mean that it had not been adulterated, or, as was once said, sophisticated.&quot; Another explanation is that this etymology &quot;is derived from a Greeks-bearing-gifts story of deceit and betrayal. For the feat of victory, the Romans demanded the handing over of obligatory tributes. Following bad advice, the Greeks resorted to some faux-marble statues made of wax, which they offered as tribute. These promptly melted in the warm Greek sun.&quot; The Oxford English Dictionary states, however, that &quot;there is no probability in the old explanation from &#x27;without wax.

The popularity of the &quot;without wax&quot; etymology is reflected in its use as a minor subplot in Dan Brown&#x27;s 1998 thriller novel &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, though Brown attributes it to the Spanish language, not Latin. Reference to the same etymology, this time attributed to Latin, later appears in his 2009 novel, &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;.

==In Western societies==
Sincerity was discussed by Aristotle in his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. It resurfaced to become an ideal (virtue) in Europe and North America in the 17th century. It gained considerable momentum during the Romantic movement, when sincerity was first celebrated as an artistic and social ideal, exemplified in the writings of Thomas Carlyle and John Henry Newman. In middle to late nineteenth century America, sincerity was reflected in mannerisms, hairstyles, women&#x27;s dress, and the literature of the time. 

Literary critic Lionel Trilling dealt with the subject of sincerity, its roots, its evolution, its moral quotient, and its relationship to authenticity in a series of lectures published as &quot;Sincerity and Authenticity&quot;.

===Aristotle&#x27;s views===
According to Aristotle &quot;truthfulness or sincerity is a desirable mean state between the deficiency of irony or self-deprecation and the excess of boastfulness.&quot;

== In Islam ==
In the Islamic context, sincerity means: being free from worldly motives and not being a hypocrite. In the Qur&#x27;an, all acts of worship and human life should be motivated by the pleasure of God, and the prophets of God have called man to sincere servitude in all aspects of life. Sincerity in Islam is divided into sincerity in belief and sincerity in action. Sincerity in belief means monotheism—in other words not associating partners with God—and sincerity in action means performing sincere worship only for God.

==In East Asian societies==

Sincerity is developed as a virtue in East Asian societies (e.g. China, Korea, and Japan). The concept of ()—as expounded in two of the Confucian classics, the &quot;Da Xue&quot; and the &quot;Zhong Yong&quot;—is generally translated as &quot;sincerity&quot;. As in the West, the term implies a congruence of avowal and inner feeling, but inner feeling is in turn ideally responsive to ritual propriety and social hierarchy. Specifically, Confucius&#x27;s &quot;Analects&quot; contains the following statement in Chapter I: () &quot;Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Then no friends would not be like yourself (all friends would be as loyal as yourself). If you make a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it.&quot;

Thus, even today, a powerful leader will praise leaders of other realms as &quot;sincere&quot; to the extent that they &quot;know their place&quot; in the sense of fulfilling a role in the drama of life. In Japanese the character for may be pronounced , which carries still more strongly the sense of loyal avowal and belief.

<text>William Saluga (September 16, 1937 – March 28, 2023) was an American comedian and founding member of the improvisational comedy troupe Ace Trucking Company. He appeared on several television programs, including &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

==Early life==
Saluga was born on September 16, 1937, in Youngstown, Ohio. When Saluga was 10, his father was killed in an industrial accident at the Republic Steel Mill where he worked and his mother supported the family by working as a bookkeeper. Saluga, known as &quot;Billy&quot; to his friends and family, was a high school cheerleader and class clown. After graduation, he served two years in the Navy and then began working as a performer in local theaters.

==Career==
Saluga spent several years performing in Youngstown, Ohio theaters and clubs. He played numerous roles in notable productions, including &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. He became a talent coordinator for the Steve Allen show in the late 1960s. in 1969, he created the &quot;Johnson&quot; character while a member of the comedic troupe &quot;Ace Trucking Company&quot;.

Saluga&#x27;s shtick as the character &quot;Johnson&quot; would be, when someone would refer to him as &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot; or by the common generic nickname &quot;Johnson,&quot; to exaggeratedly feign offense and list off all permutations of the name Raymond J. Johnson Jr. and nicknames thereof that do not mention the word &quot;Johnson:&quot;

&quot;NOOO!!! You don&#x27;t have to call me Johnson! My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr. Now you can call me Ray, or you can call me J, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Sonny, or you can call me Junie, or you can call me Junior; now you can call me Ray J, or you can call me RJ, or you can call me RJJ, or you can call me RJJ Jr. . . but you doesn&#x27;t hasta call me Johnson!&quot; 

Saluga would then smugly turn away and begin puffing on his cigar. Saluga&#x27;s routine 
received more widespread attention in the late 1970s after being used in a series of commercials for Miller Lite beer, and subsequently, in the early 1980s for Anheuser-Busch Natural Light beer. Saluga appeared alongside comedian/pitchman Norm Crosby echoing (in a roundabout way) Norm&#x27;s advice to unknowing customers on how to more easily order the lengthily-named beer: &quot;Well, y&#x27;doesn&#x27;t hasta call it Anheuser Busch Natural Light Beer, and y&#x27;doesn&#x27;t hasta call it &#x27;Busch Natural.&#x27; Just say &#x27;Natural!&#x27;&quot; Saluga then later launches into the &quot;You can call me Ray&quot; routine after Crosby warns not to ask Johnson his name.

From 1977 to 1978, Saluga appeared regularly as Raymond J. Johnson Jr. on Redd Foxx&#x27;s eponymous variety show. Saluga as Johnson also made appearances on &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot;, &quot;Laugh-In&quot; and &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot;. He also made appearances on Chuck Barris&#x27; &quot;The Gong Show&quot; during 1977 and 1978. 

A novelty disco single called &quot;Dancin&#x27; Johnson,&quot; based around Johnson&#x27;s schtick, was released in 1978.

First appearing in 1977, a character called Zallman T. Tombstone, Jr. has popped up many times over the years on the &quot;Svengoolie&quot; television show. He is a floating human skull with a thick mustache and a voice provided by Svengoolie portrayer Rich Koz. A 1978 episode of &quot;Good Times&quot; contained a scene where Keith (while intoxicated) recited &quot;You can call me Ray, or you can call me J&quot; which was at the height of its popularity for the saying. Bob Dylan referenced the &quot;you may call me&quot; schtick in his 1979 hit, &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody,&quot; when he sings, &quot;You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy / You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy / You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray / You may call me anything, but no matter what you say / You’re gonna have to serve somebody.&quot; The idea for the verse originated from Jerry Wexler, who suggested it during the recording sessions for &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;.

The character&#x27;s popularity is referenced in multiple episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, with Saluga appearing as himself in the 2002 episode &quot;The Old Man and the Key&quot;. Saluga also appeared as Johnson in the 2010 &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Just Another Manic Kahn-Day&quot;. 

In 2005, he featured in three episodes of Season 5 of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, playing Louis Lewis, the fictional cousin of Richard Lewis; Saluga&#x27;s character is in a coma for the first two episodes, only to recover in the final episode, much to the consternation of star Larry David, who was hoping that Louis would die and provide the kidney Richard Lewis needs, so that Larry could avoid having to donate one of his own.

==Death and legacy==
Saluga died of cardiopulmonary arrest in Los Angeles on March 28, 2023, aged 85. Saluga&#x27;s nephew, Scott Saluga, told the media that his uncle was living in Burbank, California, at the time of his death. Bill Saluga left no surviving immediate family members. He had often told friends he didn&#x27;t mind being typecast and known to the public as Raymond Johnson. 

Comedian David Steinberg said that &quot;Billy was always doing Ray J. He was relentless with it. I would say &#x27;Mr. Johnson&#x27; and Billy would be off. He did it everywhere. At parties. His timing and delivery were so funny every time.&quot; In 2017, Saluga said that people never recognized him outside his character and that it gave him great pleasure hearing people perform his shtick in his presence without knowing who he was.

<text>Adelaide Gaol is a former Australian prison located in the Park Lands of Adelaide, in the state of South Australia. The gaol was the first permanent one in South Australia and operated from 1841 until 1988. The is one of the two oldest buildings still standing in South Australia, the other being Government House which was built at the same time. The prison is now a museum, tourist attraction and function centre.

==Origins==
When the first colonists arrived at South Australia in late 1836, any prisoners (there were few at first) were held in irons aboard the ships HMS &quot;Buffalo&quot; and then &quot;Tam O&#x27;Shanter&quot;. In early 1837 the public were warned that escaped convicts from New South Wales may reach the colony and in mid-1837 &quot;Buffalo&quot; and &quot;Tam O&#x27;Shanter&quot; sailed away. Recognising the need, tenders had already been called for a &quot;temporary&quot; gaol. Meanwhile, the governor&#x27;s guard of Royal Marines held prisoners in their encampment in the present Botanic Gardens, chained to a tree.

As the population expanded, a temporary lock-up became necessary, which was built in early 1838 near Government House, Adelaide (then a mere hut) so the marines could guard both prisoners and Governor John Hindmarsh. This was a wooden slab affair, with timber palisade fences, although one room was freestone, which became known as the &#x27;stone jug&#x27;. It was located at the north-east corner of present Government House Domain. In 1838, the first sheriff, Samuel Smart, was wounded during a robbery that led to one of the offenders, Michael Magee, becoming the first person to be hanged in South Australia on 2 May 1838. When Governor Hindmarsh left, he also took all his marines, so the South Australia Police then ran the temporary gaol (through until Adelaide Gaol was built). Long term prisoners were sentenced to transportation in the eastern penal colonies, escorted there by police on inter-coastal ships. Even so, the gaol was overcrowded, sometimes holding up to seventy prisoners. Parts of the gaol became so &quot;dilapidated that if it had not been for the building behind, [it] would have collapsed&quot;. In July 1838, it was reported that prisoners easily escaped because &quot;the walls were rotten and there were gaps in the foundation&quot;.

When Governor George Gawler arrived he was appalled at the conditions, saying that security was only being maintained by an &quot;expensive multiplicity of sentries&quot;. London police sub-inspectors James Stuart and William Baker Ashton arrived in November 1838 to form the first police force, but found it had already been formed, in April 1838, under Henry Inman. Sensing that the gaol needed its own professional management, Gawler thereupon appointed Ashton to the new position of Governor of the Gaol, effective 1 January 1839, but still answerable to Inman for funding, administration, and staff.

==Construction and disputation==
Although Governor Gawler was under orders from the &quot;Select Committee on South Australia&quot; in Britain not to undertake any public works, in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design a permanent Gaol to hold 140 prisoners. The plans were based on England&#x27;s Pentonville prison. Proceedings of the Select Committee indicate that in Britain nothing was known of the gaol&#x27;s construction and there is no record of any mention in any official dispatches from South Australia.

The original estimate for construction was £17,000 (2011 $4,564,500), however in late July 1840, one month after construction began, the plans were altered by Governor George Gawler. Although all the foundations had been laid the new plans halved the building work, which effectively reduced the contract cost to £10,000 although this did not include the cost of work already completed. In October, Gawler again altered the plans by now including the gaoler&#x27;s house he had earlier dropped from the original plans, added two more towers and increased the quality of the stonework by specifying ashlar which cost fifty percent more than the wrought stone specified in the original contract. These new alterations added £9,000 to the cost. By March 1841 the goal was nearing completion, the builders Borrow and Goodiar had already received £l0,950 and they now requested a further £8,733 which Gawler refused. The dispute resulted in the claim being arbitrated in court and the arbitrators requested an independent valuation of the work completed.

In May, Gawler was replaced by George Grey who accused Gawler of acting &quot;under no authority whatever&quot;. Gawler denied responsibility for the work and blamed Kingston. Kingston himself claimed the work was authorised by the Board of Works who denied even inspecting the site despite evidence they did so weekly. As Gawler had kept no documentation whatsoever regarding the contract it could not be determined who was responsible and Kingston&#x27;s appointment was later terminated on 4 August, six days after the gaol was completed. In early September the valuation was completed with the value of work estimated at more than £32,000 above the sum already paid, which the court awarded to Borrow and Goodiar. On 5 November the builders submitted a claim for the £32,000 plus interest, commission, legal costs and arbitration fees of more than £4,000 (2011: $9,666,000 in total). Grey refused and threatened to put the case before the British Government. In February 1842 Grey commissioned another valuation that presented a revised valuation of £19,650 (2011: $5,276,000) based solely on the original plans, which was offered to the builders. It was initially declined but accepted following pressure from the Bank of South Australia with whom Borrow and Goodiar had an £11,000 (2011: $2,954,000) overdraft. By the end of 1842 both of the colonies newspapers had taken up the cause in favour of the builders and a &quot;memorial&quot; was presented to the &quot;Secretary of the Colonies&quot; in Britain, demanding that the arbitration decision be honoured or put before a jury trial. The sum was reluctantly paid, although the actual construction costs still resulted in the builders declaring bankruptcy.

The cost blow out to approximately £40,000 (2011: $10,740,000), being a fifth of the total funding for the establishment of the newly settled colony was the main cause of a statewide depression and numerous bankruptcies. Governor Gawler was summoned back to England to explain his &quot;extravagant&quot; building program. Originally designed to have four ornate turrets, only two towers were completed, and only one of those was the ornate turret as planned.

==History==
On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1840, the first prisoners, some fourteen debtors, were transferred from the old temporary gaol to occupy the first yard to be completed at the new Adelaide Gaol. Remaining prisoners at the old gaol were transferred in early 1841, as further building work was completed. William Baker Ashton became the first governor, a position he held until his death 1854. From that time the police no longer staffed the gaol, as Ashton now had his own budget. Also, he was now fully answerable to the sheriff, instead of the commissioner of police. Gaol staff consisted of two &quot;turnkeys&quot; and two guards. During this time the gaol was commonly referred to by the public as &quot;Ashton&#x27;s Hotel.&quot; From 1867 to 1869 Sister Mary MacKillop, foundress of the Australian Sisters of Saint Joseph and later canonised as Australia&#x27;s first Saint, regularly visited the gaol and along with members of her order tended both male and female prisoners. Sister Mary&#x27;s order initially provided assistance for female prisoners after their release until November 1867 when the order extended its services to all women. At times the prison was guarded by a number of troops on loan from Tasmania until 1846 when Francis Dutton, who went on to become the seventh Premier of South Australia in 1863, complained that the gaol was both an eyesore and a waste of money as since being opened it had housed on average only two prisoners per month.

The first attempt at escaping occurred in August 1854 when two prisoners were &quot;caught in the act&quot; with each receiving 36 lashes. The first &quot;successful&quot; escape was in 1897 when three prisoners made it as far as Blanchetown before being recaptured.

In 1942 the &quot;New Building&quot; was taken over by the military for use as a detention barracks. The gallows located in the building were used for a civilian execution on 26 April 1944. Following public protests over the unsanitary conditions at both Yatala Labour Prison and Adelaide Gaol, extensive renovations were carried out in 1954–55. A toilet block was constructed in 4 and 6 yards and a semi-circular wall built in &quot;The Circle&quot; to allow more privacy for visits. Previously, prisoners would line up toeing a brass rail in the Sally port of the main gate with visitors standing opposite and no closer than which required the raising of voices to be heard over adjacent conversations. Former prisoners have stated that after a few minutes the noise level would be so high that no one could be heard. In 1955 a doctor was retained to make daily visits, Previously, a prisoner needed to &quot;prove&quot; they were ill before being taken to see a doctor. In 1961 a shower block was constructed and a bakery established which would supply bread to both Yatala and Adelaide Gaols. By this time the gaol was badly affected by salt damp and throughout the 1960s many prisoners were kept busy repairing it. In 1963 the Deputy Keeper&#x27;s rooms in the governor&#x27;s residence were converted to administrative offices and a new residence was built in the forecourt, adjacent to the gaol entrance.

In 1965 it was announced that the gaol would be demolished and all but essential maintenance work ceased. In 1969 this decision was reversed and the gaol&#x27;s female inmates were transferred to a new facility at Northfield. Throughout the 1970s considerable modernisation of the old buildings occurred with one building (6 Yard remand prisoners) demolished and rebuilt. In 1971 all staff housing on the site was vacated with most of the guards former residences demolished.

In 1980 it was announced that the gaol would be closed once new facilities were completed and the only major work that took place until it did close was the installation of security cameras in 1984. Later that year the remand prisoners were transferred to the new Adelaide Remand Centre. The remaining Adelaide Gaol prisoners were transferred in 1987 when Mobilong Prison opened.

Adelaide Gaol was decommissioned in 1988 and the site taken over by the South Australian Department for Environment and Heritage and reopened as a museum and tourist attraction with overnight accommodation in cells for tourists. In 2007, the gaol was found to not comply with the relevant safety regulations for accommodation, ending the option. The Deputy Keeper&#x27;s residence, built in 1963, was later considered not in keeping with the overall architectural style of the complex and demolished in October 2009.

Other sites deemed not to comply in keeping were the library in Three Yard and the shower facilities area in Four Yard.

===Layout===

The Gaol has a radial plan which means access is gained to all the cellblocks and exercise yards from one central point. This point was called &quot;The Circle&quot; as wagons delivering supplies or prisoners to the gaol would have to complete a full circle in order to leave. The cellblocks were divided into &quot;yards&quot; which offered varied facilities and housing for prisoners based on their category.

*Yard 1 was built in 1850 to house women, which it did until 1969 when all female prisoners were transferred to a new facility at Adelaide Women&#x27;s Prison. This block then had various uses such as for remand prisoners or for those with infectious diseases. The block was later renamed The Lane, as it both bordered, and was accessed from, the lane that separated the administration buildings from the cell blocks. In the mid- sixties the upstairs sections were gutted to provide ground floor open dormitory accommodation for prisoners deemed low risk. These prisoners wore suede shoes (work boots were the norm for prisoners) and could have personal items containing materials normally banned, such as glass in photograph frames. It also gave easier access to the industries which were in The Lane, like the Bakehouse and Laundry (which was directly below).
*Yard 2 consisted of a three-storey cell block which also originally housed female prisoners, this cell block extended into Yard One.
*Yard 3 was originally the Debtors&#x27; Yard before they were moved to Yard 5. This was then taken over by the women until their move in December 1969. This yard contains the dormitory built specifically for the women in 1965. It also contains the Induction Centre which was where prisoners were taken after being processed. They could have their shower and change clothes here. This was constructed in 1978. There was also a library in this yard plus the original women&#x27;s kitchen.
*Yard 4 consisted of two-storey cell blocks which housed the male prisoners. The last three cells in the cell block on the right facing into the yard were the condemned cells. Those under sentence of death were placed in here for the night. There was another area in the Laneway where they would spend time during the day.
*Yard 6 included what was previously yard 5 after the separating wall was removed. As one of the yard 4 cellblocks was part of the wall separating the yards, the east side lower floor was only accessible from yard 6. The yard&#x27;s own single storey cellblock was demolished and replaced with a new building in the 1970s – this was the dining area serving that particular yard. This yard was for prisoners on remand. This was the first section to be vacated once the Remand Centre in the city was opened in 1986.
*The New Building, the only building in the Gaol constructed by prison labour, was built in 1878 and opened in 1879 to accommodate increasing prisoner numbers. Called the &quot;New Building&quot; at the time, the name remained and is still the official name of the building. A permanent gallows was built in the A-Wing of the New Building which was used until 1950.

Several yards also contained ablution blocks; cells contained buckets for use as toilets and these were emptied and cleaned here.

===Daily routine===

At 7 am, breakfast was delivered to, and eaten in, the cell. At 8 am the cell was inspected to make sure that it was clean and tidy. Toilet buckets were then taken into the yards to be emptied and cleaned by volunteers (this was one of the highest-paid of the few jobs available at the gaol). The set-up for the New Building was slightly different in that buckets were left by one of the doors leading out and picked up prior to prisoners returning to their cells in the evening.

As there were few recreational facilities available, most inmates would constantly walk up and down the yards or just sit and talk or play cards. Inmates returned to their cells at 11 am for lunch, after which they could return to the yards. Inmates returned to their cells at 4 pm when dinner was served and the lights were turned out at 10 pm. At the beginning and end of every meal break, prisoners were counted and a roll call taken.

Each inmate was provided with a black Felt jacket and work boots. Twice a week trolleys containing a change of clothing were brought to the yards. Each week inmates were provided with of loose tobacco, papers and matches. Volunteering inmates provided services such as maintenance, cleaning and hairdressing without pay to relieve the routine. Recreational facilities were limited to a library of donated books and decks of cards. Paper and pens, which had to be returned after use, were provided once a week for prisoners to write two letters, while writing materials were banned at other times.

From 1841 to 1988 around 300,000 inmates passed through the gaol. The highest number of prisoners held at one time was 440 in the 1960s, when many were forced to sleep three in a cell. The gaol also had overcrowding problems after the riots at Yatala Labour Prison in 1983. Buildings were burned and some inmates were transferred temporarily to Adelaide Gaol. Normally inmates on remand were allowed to sleep two to a cell which, although having the same dimensions as single cells, were provided with a bunk bed. Prior to the 1960s, the average age of inmates was approximately 22 years but during the 1970s this average dropped to 19 years of age. Once sentenced, those with terms of three months or less would be placed in single cells, while those with longer sentences were transferred to Yatala Labour Prison, the Cadell Training Centre and, until it closed in 1975, Gladstone Gaol. Inmates who possessed certain useful skills, such as cooks, and who were sentenced to many years imprisonment would often remain at Adelaide Gaol to serve their sentences.

Until an Act of Parliament in 1858 mandated private executions, seven hangings were held in public outside the gaol gate with the first occurring in November 1840 while the site was still under construction. Joseph Stagg was the first prisoner to be executed for his involvement with a cattle duffing gang. From 1861 to 1883, 13 prisoners were executed on portable gallows erected between the Gaol&#x27;s inner and outer walls. Executions were moved to the &quot;New Building&quot; in 1894 where a further 21 prisoners were executed. The &quot;Hanging Tower&quot; was converted to that use in 1950 and used for the last four executions before capital punishment was abolished in 1976. From 1840 to 1964, 45 of the 66 people executed in South Australia were executed by hanging at the Gaol. William Ridgway was the youngest at 19 in 1874, Elizabeth Woolcock the only woman in 1873 and the last was Glen Sabre Valance in 1964.

Five prisoners were executed from the original temporary Adelaide Gaol. They were not executed on site. The first three executions took place in the parklands west of Montefiore Hill, and the final 2 were hanged together in the original police barracks that still stand off North Terrace. They were buried in unmarked graves. 

==Archaeology==
In 2007, a volunteer fell through rotting floorboards in a yard 2 building formerly used as the Prison officers recreation area and tea room. Underneath the floor were found the remains of a previously unknown building which resulted in a two-year archaeological investigation. It had long been suspected that South Australia&#x27;s first settlers had camped somewhere along the River Torrens while waiting for the city to be laid out. The investigations revealed that this site may have been that original camp site. The archaeological dig revealed five distinct levels.

Level one Pre 1836: shows evidence of hunting, fishing and camping by the indigenous inhabitants before settlement. Objects found include stone tools and weapons.

Level two 1836 to 1840: evidence of the tents and mud huts of the first settlers. Objects found include animal bones, ceramics, glass, metal, buttons and a child&#x27;s tooth. As the settlers had no sheep, a sheep bone confirmed that there was contact between the states.

Level three 1840 to 1847: evidence of the area being used as a work site. The builders of the Gaol, Borrow and Goodiar employed 200 workers who camped nearby. Objects found include scraps of metal, iron, broken bricks, mortar, buttons and animal bone from the workers meals.

Level four 1847 to 1900: the original floor of the building. The building was the same shape as it is today but had a wooden floor divided into six cells which were in use by female prisoners from 1847 to 1867 when the building was converted to work rooms and a Matron&#x27;s room. The Matron&#x27;s room contained a fireplace with the coke to fuel it stored beneath the floor of the room opposite. A wall outside of the Matron&#x27;s room had traces of coke on both sides but may have been from a forge used during the earlier construction. Found in the cracks of the floorboards were needles, pins, thimbles, oakum, string and buttons.

Level five 1900 to 1988: the current building. Used as a recreation area and tea room by the time the gaol closed, the underfloor area showed use as a bathroom, laundry and kitchen with two concrete reinforcing slabs probably laid during the 1920s to support copper boilers. Objects found include cutlery, tea bags and sugar sachets.

The excavations have been left open for public viewing and some of the retrieved items are on display in the building.

==Museum==

The Adelaide Gaol Museum offers educational guided tours lasting 60 minutes. The tours are interactive.
Primary and primary school tours emphasize prisoner life within Adelaide Prison, the intermediate years are based on a Poetry Slam competition where students make up Haikus and the high school tour culminates in a specific debate.
All students have the opportunity to explore the courtyards and jail cells, touch artifacts such as handcuffs and escape ropes and contemplate the dark history of South Australia.

==Tourism==
The Gaol is open for self-guided tours 7 days a week from 10 am to 4 pm (last entry 3 pm). Ghost tours also operate at night.

== Adelaide Park Lands and Dame Roma Mitchell Gardens==

The Gaol is located within Park 27 / Tulya Wardli of the Adelaide Park Lands. The Dame Roma Mitchell Gardens are a community garden located within the gaol walls. Until 1988 the gardens were tended by prisoners. The gardens are now a source of fruit, vegetables and flowers donated for use in meals for the homeless and food hampers for the needy. The gardens are now tended by volunteers, and funded by charities and corporate donations.

<text>Sardar Mohammad Azim Khan Barakzai () was the last Durrani Afghan governor of Kashmir (1812–1819). He was the second son of the Barakzai chief Payinda Sarfaraz Khan, while his elder brother Fateh Khan was the kingmaker and Vizier to Mahmud Shah Durrani. He was one of 21 brothers from eight mothers including his half-brother Dost Mohammad Khan who would later become Emir of Afghanistan.

==Career==
In 1810, Azim Khan was tasked by Mahmud Shah Durrani to capture his rival for the throne, Shah Shujah Durrani, who had raised an army of partisans in Peshawar. He successfully defeated Shah Shuja&#x27;s armies and was subsequently involved in the 1812-13 joint Afghan-Sikh capture of Kashmir from its rebellious governor Atta Khan Bamzai. He was appointed governor of Kashmir and in 1814 successfully repelled an attempted invasion by the Sikhs led by Ranjit Singh.

After the blinding and murder of Fateh Khan by Shahzada Kamran Durrani, Mohammad. Azim Khan became Barakzai chief and along with his brothers swore revenge against the Emir. All former Durrani empire provinces except Herat came under Barakzai control and he set himself up as Governor of Kabul having left Kashmir in the hands of his half-brother Jabbar Khan Navab. He invited Shah Shujah Durrani back from exile but installed Ayub Shah Durrani as puppet ruler instead.

In the summer of 1819 his half-brother Yar Mohammad. Khan, governor of Peshawar, failed to impede Ranjit Singh on his march towards Kashmir and the Sikhs annexed the province after defeating Jabbar Khan in the Battle of Shopian. He attempted but failed to secure an alliance with the British while trying to secure his wealth and political position against his brothers, other Afghan nobles, the Sikhs and neighbouring rulers.

In March 1823, Azim Khan alongside other Pashtuns faced off against the Sikh Khalsa Army of Ranjit Singh at the Battle of Nowshera near Peshawar. After being repulsed on the first day he abandoned his allies, who had regrouped to continue fighting and retreated to Kabul where he died shortly thereafter. As a result, the Afghans lost their former stronghold of Peshawar Valley to the Sikh Empire.

He was reputed to have acquired great wealth through war plunder and excessive taxation, especially during his time as governor of Kashmir. Azim Khan died shortly after the battle of Nowshera from Cholera. His son Habiballah Khan inherited his estate and took control of Kabul after his death but was soon ousted by Dost Mohammad Khan.

<text>Conrad Paumann (c. 1410January 24, 1473) was a German organist, lutenist and composer of the early Renaissance. Born blind, he became one of the most talented musicians of the 15th century, and his performances created a sensation wherever he went. He is grouped among the composers known as the Colorists.

==Life==
He was born in Nuremberg to a family of craftsmen. His musical ability must have become apparent early, for he received an excellent training with the support of aristocratic patrons. In 1447 he became the official town organist of Nuremberg, and the councilors even issued orders for him not to leave without their permission.

As rebellious as he was talented, Paumann left what was probably a stifling environment, traveling secretly to Munich in 1450 where he was immediately employed by Duke Albrecht III as court organist, who also gave him a house. Munich was officially his home for the remainder of his life, although he began to travel extensively.

While exact records of his travels do not remain, they were clearly extensive, and everywhere he went he was greeted with astonishment; his renown as a performer and composer grew. Milan and Naples both made him attractive job offers. His travels in Italy were probably around 1470, when the Milanese Sforza family was beginning to build their chapel into the most impressive singing and composition establishment in Europe: Josquin des Prez, Loyset Compère, Alexander Agricola and others were all there; some of them may have heard him play, and may have exchanged musical ideas with him. In Mantua he was knighted; in Landshut he performed for the Burgundian duke Philip the Good; in Ratisbon he performed for Emperor Frederick III. During this time he also had numerous students. Unquestionably his influence had much to do with the subsequent development of a culture of organ-playing and composition in Germany, a tradition which culminated in the 18th century with the work of J.S. Bach.
Paumann&#x27;s epitaph in the Munich Frauenkirche reads: 
Paumann&#x27;s gift, his disability, his instrument, and his influence are all reminiscent of Francesco Landini, the great Italian composer of a hundred years before.

==Music and influence==
Paumann, being blind, never wrote down his music, and may have been an improvisor above all. He has been credited with inventing the system of tablature for the lute in Germany; while it cannot be proven, it seems reasonable both because of Paumann&#x27;s influence, and because of the ease with which music can be dictated using tablature.

Most of his music is instrumental, and some of it considerably virtuosic. Only one vocal composition survives, a &quot;tenorlied&quot; &quot;Wiplich figur&quot; for three voices; stylistically it is so close to the contemporary Franco-Flemish idiom that it follows that Paumann knew the music of the Franco-Flemish composers. Most likely he encountered it on his travels, for instance when he went to Milan.

His &quot;Fundamentum organisandi&quot; of 1452, an instruction manual for improvisation, was combined with the Lochamer-Liederbuch of approximately the same date; the double source is housed in the Berlin Staatsbibliothek.

<text>Ononis is a large genus of perennial herbs and shrubs from the legume family Fabaceae. The members of this genus are often called restharrows as some species grow as weeds on arable lands whose tough stems would stop the harrow. They are natively distributed in Europe.

In herbalism restharrow is used to treat bladder and kidney problems and water retention.

The active ingredients in restharrow are essential oils, flavonoid-glycosides, and tannins.

Restharrows are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grey pug and &quot;Coleophora ononidella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;O. arvensis&quot;).

<doc id="1221227" wikidata="Q145515" url="?curid=1221227" title="The Mountain Goats">
<text>The Mountain Goats are a United States band formed in Claremont, California, by singer-songwriter John Darnielle. The band is currently based in Durham, North Carolina. For many years, the sole member of the Mountain Goats was Darnielle, despite the plural moniker. Although he remains the core member of the band, he has worked with a variety of collaborators over time, including bassist and vocalist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster, multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, singer-songwriter Franklin Bruno, bassist and vocalist Rachel Ware, singer-songwriter/producer John Vanderslice, guitarist Kaki King, and multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark.

Throughout the 1990s, the Mountain Goats were known for producing low-fidelity home recordings (most notably, on a cassette deck boombox) and releasing recordings in cassette or vinyl 7-inch formats. Since 2002, the Mountain Goats have adopted a more polished approach, often recording studio albums with a full band.

==History==
===Early years===
The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins song &quot;Yellow Coat&quot;. Darnielle released his first recording as the Mountain Goats (&quot;Taboo VI: The Homecoming&quot;, on Shrimper Records) in 1991. Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band the Casual Girls, who became known as the Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group&#x27;s members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.

The first five years of the Mountain Goats&#x27; career saw a prolific output of songs on cassette, vinyl and CD. These releases spanned multiple labels and countries of origin, often released in limited numbers. The focus of the Mountain Goats project was the urgency of writing. Songs not recorded adequately to tape within days of being written were often forgotten. Cassette releases during this time include &quot;The Hound Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Transmissions to Horace&quot;, &quot;Hot Garden Stomp&quot;, &quot;Taking the Dative&quot;, and &quot;Yam, the King of Crops&quot;.

In 1994, the Mountain Goats released their first full-length studio album, &quot;Zopilote Machine&quot;, on Ajax Records. It is the band&#x27;s only full album featuring the entirety of the Bright Mountain Choir.

===1995–2000: &quot;Sweden&quot;, &quot;Nothing for Juice&quot;, &quot;Full Force Galesburg&quot;, and &quot;The Coroner&#x27;s Gambit&quot;===

By 1995, most of what could be considered classic Mountain Goats conventions (boom-box recording, song series, Latin quotes, and mythological themes) were abandoned in favor of a more thematically focused and experimental sound. This period was marked by Darnielle&#x27;s collaborations with other artists including Alastair Galbraith and Simon Joyner. In November 1996, Darnielle announced a vow to &quot;clear his musical tendency for profanity&quot; to promote a more optimistic reception to the ideas outlined in his material.

In 1995, the album &quot;Sweden&quot; was released. Soon after its recording, a sequel titled &quot;Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg&quot; was recorded, but never released. It remained unheard by the general public until 2007, when it was leaked against Darnielle&#x27;s wishes. In 1996, the Mountain Goats released the album &quot;Nothing for Juice&quot;, and &quot;Full Force Galesburg&quot; the following year. Rachel Ware left the band between recording the two albums, and bassist Peter Hughes took over her position.

Between 1998 and 2000, the Mountain Goats slowed down their prolific output, releasing &quot;The Coroner&#x27;s Gambit&quot; in October 2000. The album partially returned to the band&#x27;s roots, as most songs were sporadically recorded on Darnielle&#x27;s old Panasonic RX-FT500 cassette deck Boombox, which produced a loud background noise to the songs.

===2001–2003: &quot;All Hail West Texas&quot; and &quot;Tallahassee&quot;===
2002 saw the release of two Mountain Goats albums: &quot;All Hail West Texas&quot; and &quot;Tallahassee&quot;. These albums mark a distinct change in focus for the Mountain Goats project, being the first in a series of concept albums that explore aspects of The Mountain Goats&#x27; canon in depth. &quot;All Hail West Texas&quot; featured the resurrection of Darnielle&#x27;s early boom box recording for a complete album. Darnielle considers this album to be the culmination of his lo-fi recording style. &quot;Tallahassee&quot;, the first Mountain Goats album to be recorded with a full band and in a studio, explores and concludes the relationship of a couple whose lives were the subject of the song cycle known as the Alpha Series. It was the first album to be released on a major label, 4AD, marking the start of the 4AD years of the band.

Also released that year was &quot;Martial Arts Weekend&quot;, attributed to The Extra Glenns, a collaboration with Franklin Bruno on several previously unreleased Mountain Goats songs. Following that recording, Bruno joined Darnielle in the studio along with bassist Peter Hughes, who was the second official member of the band and accompanied Darnielle on tour. These three musicians formed what was considered the Mountain Goats studio band.

===2004–2009: 4AD years===
In 2004, the Mountain Goats released &quot;We Shall All Be Healed&quot;. The album marked a number of changes for the Mountain Goats, as it was the first time Darnielle worked with producer John Vanderslice, and the first album of directly autobiographical material. &quot;We Shall All Be Healed&quot; chronicles Darnielle&#x27;s life with a group of friends and acquaintances addicted to methamphetamine in Portland, Oregon, though the album is set in Pomona, California. The following year, the band&#x27;s second Vanderslice-produced album, &quot;The Sunset Tree&quot;, was released. Again autobiographical, Darnielle tackled the subject of his early childhood spent with an abusive stepfather. Darnielle had previously dealt with this subject in what he often refers to as the only &quot;extensively autobiographical&quot; song he had written before 2004, the 1999 unreleased song &quot;You&#x27;re in Maya&quot;. The Mountain Goats relocated to Durham, North Carolina in 2006, and issued &quot;Get Lonely&quot;, which was produced by Scott Solter, who had worked with Vanderslice on engineering for prior Mountain Goats records.

Jon Wurster joined the group in 2007, playing drums on the last leg of the &quot;Get Lonely&quot; tour. The band recorded tracks for its next album at Prairie Sun studios. Entitled &quot;Heretic Pride&quot;, the album was released on 19 February 2008. Produced by John Vanderslice and Scott Solter, the album saw Darnielle, Hughes, and Wurster joined by Franklin Bruno, Erik Friedlander, Annie Clark (better known by her stage name, St. Vincent), and members of The Bright Mountain Choir. American alternative hip hop artist Aesop Rock released a remix of the track &quot;Lovecraft in Brooklyn&quot; from the album, and in return Darnielle contributed vocals to his album &quot;None Shall Pass&quot;, in the song &quot;Coffee&quot;.

In 2009, Darnielle and Vanderslice collaborated on the record &quot;Moon Colony Bloodbath&quot;. Released in a limited vinyl run of 1000 and sold during their &quot;Gone Primitive&quot; tour, the EP was a concept record about organ harvesting colonies on the Moon. This was followed by the next full Mountain Goats album, &quot;The Life of the World to Come&quot;, which released in October of the same year. The album is composed of twelve tracks, each one inspired by (and titled after) a single verse of the Christian Bible. In publicizing the record, the band made their first ever television appearance, performing &quot;Psalms 40:2&quot; on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, hosted by professed Mountain Goats fan Stephen Colbert.

===2010–present: Merge Records years===
The Mountain Goats signed to Merge Records, home to drummer Jon Wurster&#x27;s other band, Superchunk, in 2010. The label issued a new record by The Extra Lens, formerly The Extra Glenns, entitled &quot;Undercard&quot;, followed by another Mountain Goats LP, &quot;All Eternals Deck&quot;, in 2011. They were also chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he was due to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England, but were unable to appear due to a rescheduling.

The band&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Transcendental Youth&quot;, was released in late 2012, and in early 2013 they played at Carnegie Hall in support of John Green and Hank Green in their &quot;Evening of Awesome&quot; performance. In July 2013, &quot;All Hail West Texas&quot; was re-released on vinyl. During an interview with Stereogum in August 2012, John Darnielle said that Amy Grant was his favorite pop artist, and noted that &quot;Rich Mullins is one of the best songwriters I know of.&quot; Mullins was the songwriter who penned many of Grant&#x27;s hits.

The Mountain Goats released their 15th album, &quot;Beat the Champ&quot;, on 7 April 2015, again with Merge Records. According to Pitchfork Media, the album concentrates on the professional wrestlers Darnielle admired when he was a child and tries to develop and imagine their lives. Multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas assisted the group in recording the album, and soon thereafter became a full-time member.

In January 2017, the Mountain Goats recorded a humorous song per request of director Rian Johnson, depicting an alternate story of his upcoming movie, &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;. The song, titled &quot;The Ultimate Jedi Who Wastes All the Other Jedi and Eats Their Bones&quot;, was published on Johnson&#x27;s SoundCloud page.

In May 2017, they released their sixteenth studio album, &quot;Goths&quot;. The band has stated that &quot;Goths&quot; was inspired by an adolescence listening to The Cure, Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Joy Division, as well as hearing songs on the Californian radio station KROQ-FM.

In January 2019, the band announced the April 26 release of their &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; inspired album, &quot;In League with Dragons&quot; (and released initial single, &quot;Younger&quot;), via Merge Records. The announcement was accompanied by a live music stream from the Wizards of the Coast headquarters.

In March 2020, while the COVID-19 pandemic left the band unable to tour, Darnielle retrieved his old Panasonic RX-FT500 tape deck and recorded 10 new songs, using the direct-to-boombox method for the first time since 2002&#x27;s &quot;All Hail West Texas&quot;. The resulting album, entitled &quot;Songs for Pierre Chuvin&quot;, was inspired by Darnielle&#x27;s reading of Pierre Chuvin&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;A Chronicle of the Last Pagans&quot;, and was released digitally on April 10, 2020, with a limited physical release on cassette through Merge Records.

The Mountain Goats announced in August 2020 that the band&#x27;s nineteenth studio album, &quot;Getting Into Knives&quot;, would be released on October 23, 2020, on CD, vinyl, cassette, and digital.

In April 2021, the Mountain Goats announced their album &quot;Dark in Here&quot;, released on June 25, alongside the release of its first single &quot;Mobile&quot;. The album was recorded at FAME Studios. The band&#x27;s 21st album, &quot;Bleed Out&quot;, was released on August19, 2022.

In July 2023, the band announced their 22nd album &quot;Jenny from Thebes&quot;, a &quot;rock opera about a woman named Jenny&quot;, would be released on October27, 2023. The character &quot;Jenny&quot; has appeared in several previous songs by the band, notably in several from &quot;All Hail West Texas&quot;.

Peter Hughes announced his departure from the band in August 2024, citing &quot;health and sanity&quot; concerns among other reasons.

<text>A firman (; ), at the constitutional level, was a royal mandate or decree issued by a sovereign in an Islamic state. During various periods such firmans were collected and applied as traditional bodies of law. The English word &quot;firman&quot; comes from the Persian meaning &quot;decree&quot; or &quot;order&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Farmān&quot; is the modern Persian form of the word and descends from Middle Persian (Pahlavi) , ultimately from Old Persian ( = &quot;fore&quot;). The difference between the modern Persian and Old Persian forms stems from &quot;dropping the ending &quot;ā&quot; and insertion of a vowel owing to the initial double consonant&quot;. This feature (i.e. &quot;fra-&quot;) was still used in the Middle Persian form. The Turkish form of the word &quot;farmān&quot; is &quot;fermān&quot;, whereas the Arabized plural form of the word is .

== Origins of firmans in the Ottoman Empire ==
In the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan derived his authority from his role as upholder of the Shar&#x27;ia, but the Shar&#x27;ia did not cover all aspects of Ottoman social and political life. Therefore, in order to regulate relations and status, duties, and the dress of aristocracy and subjects, the Sultan created firmans.

== Organization ==

Firmans were gathered in codes called &quot;kanun&quot;. The &quot;kanun&quot; were &quot;a form of secular and administrative law considered to be a valid extension of religious law as a result of the ruler&#x27;s right to exercise legal judgement on behalf of the community.&quot;

When issued by the sultan in the Ottoman Empire, firmans&#x27; importance was often displayed by the layout of the document; the more blank space at the top of the document, the more important the firman was.

== Examples of Ottoman firmans ==

=== Firman of Murad (26 October – 23 November 1386) ===
In this firman, Sultan Murad I recognises a decree created by his father Sultan Orhan (c. 1324–1360). He gives the monks (Christian) all they owned during his father&#x27;s reign, ordering that no one can oppress them or claim their land.

=== Firman of Mehmed the Conqueror (30 August 1473) ===

Following the defeat of Uzun Hasan, Mehmed the Conqueror took over and consolidated his rule over the area. From he sent a series of letters announcing his victory, including an unusual missive in the Uyghur language addressed to the Turkomans of Anatolia.

The decree (&quot;yarlık&quot;) had 201 lines and was written by on 30 August 1473: 
=== Firman of Mehmed IV (1648–1687) ===
In this firman, the monks of Mount Athos report that the administrative officials charged with the collection of taxes come at a later date than they are supposed to and demand more money than the value assessed. They also make illegal demands for additional food supplies.

== Other firmans ==

One of the most important firmans governing relations between Muslims and Christians is a document kept at the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. This monastery is Greek Orthodox and constitutes the autonomous Sinai Orthodox Church. The firman bears the hand print of Muhammad, and requests the Muslims do not destroy the monastery for God-fearing men live there. To this day there is a protected zone around the monastery administered by the Egyptian government, and there are very good relations between the 20 or so monks, mainly from Greece, and the local community there.

Firmans were issued in some Islamic empires and kingdoms in India such as the Mughal Empire and the Nizam of Hyderabad. Notable were Emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s various firmans.

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;firman&quot; was used by the archeologist/novelist Elizabeth Peters for official permission from the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to carry on an excavation. A similar authority was cited by Austen Henry Layard for excavations at Nimrud which he mistakenly believed was Nineveh.

In the Old Yishuv Court Museum is held a firman for the 1890 opening of the printing business of Eliezer Menahem Goldberg, Jerusalem resident. The firman was translated into Hebrew from Turkish by Advocate Yosef Hai Fenizil, and shows that the business was located in Rehov Hayehudim and had permission to undertake printing in Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew, English, German, French and Italian.

<text>The Orange and Alexandria Railroad (O&amp;A) was a railroad in Virginia, United States. Chartered in 1848, it eventually extended from Alexandria to Gordonsville, with another section from Charlottesville to Lynchburg. The road played a crucial role in the American Civil War, saw the first of many mergers in 1867, and eventually became an important part of the modern-day Norfolk Southern rail system.

== Antebellum period ==
The Virginia General Assembly issued a charter to the O&amp;A on May 28, 1848, to run from Alexandria to Gordonsville. Construction began in 1850 and was completed in April 1854, when it connected with the Virginia Central Railroad in Orange County. Its longtime president was John S. Barbour Jr., a Virginia lawyer, part-time delegate and son of U.S. Representative John Strode Barbour.

In 1854, the General Assembly granted the O&amp;A the right to build southward from Charlottesville to Lynchburg. O&amp;A paid for trackage rights over Virginia Central tracks from Gordonsville to Charlottesville. In 1860, the southern extension was completed, including lucrative connections to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and the South Side Railroad. The O&amp;A also connected with the Manassas Gap Railroad (chartered in 1850), at Tudor Hall (today named Manassas for this junction) which gave it access to the Shenandoah Valley.

The railroad boosted Virginia commerce. Farmers from Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont region, and later, the Shenandoah Valley could more cheaply ship their products, produce, and goods to the markets of Washington, D.C., and Richmond, and to ocean-going vessels berthed at the Potomac River port of Alexandria. Alexandria, Richmond, and Lynchburg also became manufacturing centers. Passengers could travel from Washington to Lynchburg in eight hours instead of enduring a three-day stagecoach journey.

== American Civil War ==

The O&amp;A was strategically important during the Civil War (1861–1865) and was repeatedly fought over and wrecked. In connection with the Virginia Central, it was the only rail link between the belligerents&#x27; capitals at Washington and Richmond. An 1861 Union Army attempt to gain control of Manassas Junction led to the First Battle of Bull Run, and the junction traded hands numerous times during the war. Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson attacked it in the Battle of Manassas Station Operations to draw the Union into the 1862 Second Battle of Bull Run. The 1863 Battle of Brandy Station and Second Battle of Rappahannock Station were also fought near the railroad line.

== Reconstruction ==
The railroad entered Reconstruction in dire shape, with much of its track ripped up and most of its rolling stock destroyed. However, Barbour rebuilt the railroad with the help of various politically connected financiers and his brother-in-law J.S.B. Thompson. In 1867, the O&amp;A merged with the Manassas Gap Railroad (led by Edward Carrington Marshall) to become the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad.

After the Panic of 1873, the railroad was consolidated into the Virginia Midland Railway, which was controlled by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. It later became part of the Richmond and Danville Railroad, which went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. The following year it was merged into the Southern Railway.

A cutoff between Orange and Charlottesville was incorporated in 1876 as the Charlottesville and Rapidan Railroad and opened in 1880. The Southern Railway acquired the line in 1914.

== Modern times ==
Most of the O&amp;A right-of-way is now the Washington District line of the Norfolk Southern Railway. The main exceptions are a short segment between Orange and Gordonsville, which is part of the similarly named Washington Subdivision of the Buckingham Branch Railroad; and the easternmost portion that traveled through Old Town Alexandria to its waterfront, which no longer exists aside from the Hoofs Run Bridge and the Wilkes Street Tunnel. 

Parts of the former O&amp;A right-of-way are also used by Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express (VRE).

===Wilkes Street Tunnel===
The O&amp;A built the first transportation tunnel in Virginia: the Wilkes Street Tunnel in Alexandria, Virginia, opened in 1851 but completed in 1856. Located just a few hundred yards west of the Potomac River, it connected the wharves to the rest of the line. 

The area around the tunnel became known as &quot;Tunneltown&quot;, part of an African-American neighborhood called &quot;Hayti&quot;. By the mid-20th century. it was a shantytown and squatter&#x27;s haven known as &quot;Owens Beach&quot;. Revival efforts began in 1968 when an old row tenement on the NE corner of Royal and Wilkes was turned into luxury apartments called Tunnel Flats. 

As wharf traffic declined and Alexandria became more suburban, daily trains through the tunnel decreased to two a day. One, the Southern train to the PEPCO plant, last ran on November 25, 1969. This was a symbolic run, made at walking speed with children hanging from the train and dignitaries on hand. An employee walked in front of the locomotive as it went down Union Street, stopping to let shoppers and diners move cars that were parked on the tracks. The other train, to the Robinson Terminal at Duke Street, ceased in 1974, and the tracks were pulled up in mid-October 1975.

By 1980, the city was seeking federal funding to turn the tunnel into a bike trail, which was done before 1999. In 2003, the city added a crosswalk to Union Street to connect the tunnel to the park on the other side. In 2007-2008, the tunnel was refurbished, receiving steel reinforcement ribs, more and brighter lighting, drainage improvement, and extensive pavement repairs.

<doc id="1221234" wikidata="Q2749189" url="?curid=1221234" title="Buena Vista Park">
<text>Buena Vista Park is a park in the Haight-Ashbury and Buena Vista Heights neighborhoods of San Francisco, California. It is the oldest official park in San Francisco, established in 1867 as Hill Park, later renamed Buena Vista. It is bounded by Haight Street to the north, and by Buena Vista Avenue West and Buena Vista Avenue East. The park is on a steep hill that peaks at , and covers . The lowest section is the north end along Haight.

==Layout==
The hill on which the park lies is composed primarily of sand and San Francisco chert, formed in the Mesozoic era. The layout of the park uses the steepness of the hill to good advantage, offering good views of the city (particularly to the north).

At the peak of the park is a small lawn. Notable views are available from various lookouts lower down, including &quot;The Window,&quot; an overlook on the western side of the hill from which there is a sweeping vista of Golden Gate Park, the Pacific Ocean, and, on clear days, northward up the coast to the white cliffs of Drake&#x27;s Bay.

The paths along the west side are lined with gutters built by WPA workers out of broken headstones from the city&#x27;s Victorian cemeteries at Lone Mountain Cemetery, which were moved to Colma in the 1930s. In a few cases the inscriptions were placed facing up and can be discerned (&quot;Cf.&quot; the Wave Organ).

The northeast corner staircase features a large peace symbol (the classic Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament variety) shaped out of flower plantings. Further south a tennis court is located just inside the park at the intersection of Duboce and Buena Vista East streets.

== Other points of interest ==
Across the street from the south side of the park is 355 Buena Vista East, an architecturally notable building which appears briefly in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;. The building, constructed in 1928 as St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, has been converted to condominiums. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places.

611 Buena Vista West, on the west side of the park near Frederick Street, was a particularly noteworthy example of the modern-architecture work of Cass Calder Smith, as featured in many architectural magazines including &quot;Dwell&quot; (Jan/Feb 2005). This modern house was significantly modified with an addition of another level in 2015.

The N Judah runs underneath the park via the Sunset Tunnel.

<doc id="1221238" wikidata="Q5164160" url="?curid=1221238" title="Alabama Constitution of 1901">
<text>The Constitution of the State of Alabama of 1901 was the basic governing document of the U.S. state of Alabama. Adopted in 1901, it was Alabama&#x27;s sixth constitution.

At 388,882 words, the document was 12 times longer than the average state constitution, 51 times longer than the U.S. Constitution, and, at the time of its repeal, the longest and most amended constitution operative anywhere in the world. The English version of the Constitution of India, the longest national constitution in the world, is about 145,000 words long, less than 40% of the length of Alabama&#x27;s (was formerly about one-third, with both expanding over time).

By the time of its renaming, about 90 percent of the document&#x27;s length was made up of 977 separate amendments (for comparison, the 105 amendments to the Constitution of India form none of the latter&#x27;s text, as they modify the main body&#x27;s wording directly rather than being appended to it). About 75 percent of the amendments covered individual counties or cities, and some were so detailed as to deal with salaries of specific officials (e.g. Amendment 480 pertaining to the Greene County probate judge). As a result, Alabama had a very high number of constitutional officers. The constitution made it very difficult for residents of most counties to solve their own problems as the limited home rule required them to ask the state legislature to make amendments to the constitution or pass special legislation in order to carry out desired activities.

The Constitutional Convention was called with the intention by southern Democrats of the state &quot;within the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish white supremacy in this State&quot;. Its provisions essentially disenfranchised most African Americans and thousands of poor White Americans, who were excluded from voting until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The constitution also gave the Alabama Legislature the power to administer most counties directly, with only a few counties having even limited home rule, further entrenching disfranchisement by limiting local autonomy.

The Preamble says:
:&quot;We the people of the State of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and establish the following Constitution and form of government for the State of Alabama.&quot;

==History==

Prior to the 2022 constitution, Alabama has had six constitutions, all established via State Conventions: (converting Alabama Territory into a State), 1861 (Secession), 1865 (Reconstruction), 1868 (Reconstruction), 1875 (ending Reconstruction), and the 1901 document.

The referendum calling for the constitutional convention passed with the aid of widespread electoral fraud in the Black Belt. In 2020, columnist Bill Ivey called the result &quot;one of the most consequential voter fraud incidents in U.S. history&quot; due to the substantial long-term impact the Constitution has had.

==General overview==
The Alabama Constitution, in common with all other state constitutions, defines a tripartite government organized under a presidential system. Executive power is vested in the Governor of Alabama, legislative power in the Alabama State Legislature (bicameral, composed of the Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate), and judicial power in the Judiciary of Alabama. Direct, partisan, secret, free elections are provided for filling all branches.

==Notable features==
The length and chaotic nature of the constitution was the result of an attempt at centralization of power in the state government dating from the late 19th century, when white Democrats dominated state government.

In addition, because of challenges from Populists in 1892 and 1894 elections, the Democratic Party intended to reduce suffrage in order to secure its own dominance. This appealed to yeomen farmers of North Alabama, who had supported Populists, on the grounds of white supremacy.

The Democrats raised &quot;the Negro issue&quot; and promised that &quot;no white man would lose the franchise&quot;. But Alabama&#x27;s new constitution also &quot;would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well — and that would ensure one-party Democratic rule through most of the 20th century in the South&quot;. Glenn Feldman documented that, by 1941, more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised under this constitution.

The 1901 constitution was intended to curb executive power and to make it difficult to raise taxes, but in practice, it has resulted in the state legislature having extensive authority over counties, cities, and towns. The counties have to go to the legislature, and &quot;ipso facto&quot; representatives of uninvolved parts of the state, to get the most basic policy and financial laws passed, which often fail to get the support of the full legislature.

As a result, the state legislature devotes considerable time to local matters, and county legislative delegations handle many issues that are normally handled at the county level in most of the rest of the country.

The legislature&#x27;s power was especially strong during the first half of the 20th century, and it was heavily biased in favor of rural interests. Originally, the state&#x27;s 67 counties doubled as legislative districts: each county elected one senator and at least one representative, despite differences in population. The county&#x27;s senator was in an especially powerful position, since the county legislative delegation decided nearly all local matters.

Although the lower house was to be apportioned based on each county&#x27;s population, the legislature did not reapportion its districts for more than 60 years, despite the state constitution calling for reapportionment each decade after the national census. The vast differences in population between urban and rural counties through those decades resulted in rural areas being grossly over-represented in the legislature, giving them outsized influence over state affairs. Developing urban areas were underserved for decades and ill represented.

As a result of several federal court decisions in 1960-1967 that mandated the principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;, members of both houses of the legislature are now elected from districts of roughly equal population, and the legislature is required to reapportion itself every decade.

Even with these changes, the legislature still has great power over local government, and devotes considerable time to local issues. With the buildup of the defense industry and regional needs during World War II in Birmingham and its area, Jefferson County was finally afforded limited home rule in 1944. Limited home rule has since been granted to six other counties: Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa.

All the other counties must lobby the local legislation committees of the state House and Senate to pass local ordinances, making passing even the simplest local laws a tedious process. Most county councils or commissions elect their members by at-large voting without proportional representation, which dilutes the political power of significant minorities and generally limits their ability to elect candidates of their choice.

The constitution addresses many issues that are dealt with by statute in most other states, most notably taxation. Unlike most states, a large portion of Alabama&#x27;s tax code is written into the constitution, necessitating its amendment over even minor tax issues, which prevents most local governments from passing any ordinances on taxation. Although the home rule counties can pass ordinances on tax issues, even that authority is limited. For instance, Jefferson County cannot pass ordinances related to property taxes. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Alabama&#x27;s tax code is one of the most regressive in the nation.

Adding to the problem is the requirement that any constitutional amendment must be submitted for a statewide vote if it is not unanimously approved by the legislature. This has resulted in amendments relating to local counties and municipalities being overwhelmingly approved in the affected areas, but rejected statewide.

===Racial discrimination===
In the 21st century, the document has been criticized for discriminatory elements, though many of these have been made moot by amendments to the federal constitution, passage of federal laws, or United States Supreme Court decisions. As a result, they are not enforced because they are known to be unconstitutional, or would almost certainly be deemed so in court.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the President of the Alabama Constitutional Convention, John B. Knox, stated in his inaugural address that the intention of the convention was &quot;to establish white supremacy in this State&quot;, &quot;within the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution&quot;. The convention was following a model established by Mississippi, whose 1890 constitution with similar provisions had already survived federal court challenges, with the United States Supreme Court permitting literacy tests and poll taxes despite a challenge based on the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in &quot;Williams v. Mississippi&quot; (1898).

Section 181 required voters to pass literacy tests in order to register, which were administered subjectively by white administrators to ensure most blacks were rejected. Section 180 was a grandfather clause, creating an exemption from the literacy test for anyone who had served in the military, or was descended from a veteran. As most slaves had been prevented from serving in the military, freedmen and their descendants could not take advantage of this clause, but many illiterate whites could. Section 194 required the payment of US$1.50 poll tax (Worth approximately US$47.10 by CPI). According to historian Glenn Feldman, by 1940 the cumulative poll tax had disenfranchised more poor white voters than blacks, but this was due to a larger white population; the black population was still disenfranchised at much higher rates than whites. These provisions were invalidated by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided for federal oversight and enforcement of constitutional rights to suffrage.

The state constitution outlawed interracial marriage (Section 102). While this provision was rendered inoperative by the US Supreme Court decision in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967), it was not removed until 2000 by Amendment 667 approved by voters.

The constitution contains its original requirement for public education to be racially segregated in the state. Section 256 states that &quot;separate schools shall be provided for white and colored children, and no child of either race shall be permitted to attend a school of the other race&quot;. This provision was struck down by the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in 1954 that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, and this clause has not been enforced since the 1960s.

In 1956, following the Supreme Court decision, the legislature passed a constitutional amendment stating that the state did not guarantee a public education for the state&#x27;s children, and also supported the formation of private schools to evade desegregation. In 1991, a state district judge ruled that this amendment ran counter to the federal Constitution. The state supreme court threw out the underlying case in 2002, but did so in a manner that left the status unclear of the 1956 amendment.

Critics say that the continued existence of segregationist language is an embarrassment to the state in the 21st century.

====Attempts to remove====
In 2004 and 2012, ballot measures were put before the electorate to remove the segregationist language from the constitution. The 2004 proposal was defeated by less than 2,000 votes; conservatives objected to the proposal because it would have retained a 1901 clause mandating &quot;a liberal system of public schools&quot;, and feared it could be interpreted to require expanded financing for public education.

A Constitutional Revision Commission was organized and issued a proposal in 2012 for a vote on an amendment related to education issues. It was intended to delete the original text that mandated segregated schools. However, due to the manner in which the amendment was worded, it would have definitively reinstated the 1956 amendment that ended the guarantee of a public education to children of the state. As a result, it was opposed by both the Alabama Education Association and many black leaders. Both claimed the 1956 amendment could endanger future &quot;legal challenges to the state’s school financing structure, substantially worsening inequality while cosmetically addressing it&quot; by deleting racist language about segregation. Observers believed the bipartisan commission had some chance of success because it was &quot;specifically barred from changing the tax code&quot;, but Amendment 4 was narrowly defeated.

In 2020, ballot measure Amendment 4 was put to the electorate, authorizing the State Legislature to recompile the Constitution during its 2022 session: this includes deleting all racist language, along with numerous duplicative and repealed provisions. This measure passed with an overwhelming majority of 66.82% of the electorate voting yes.

The State Legislature met for a session in 2022 to formally revise the document, where voters were required to approve the new constitution by a simple majority. The House of Representatives unanimously approved the proposed revision on February 24 and the Senate followed suit on March 3. The revision was voted on and passed by the voters in 2022. 

Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey formally proclaimed the new constitution to be in effect on Monday, November 28, 2022, shortly after the state&#x27;s election results were certified.

===Voting restrictions===
Section 177 denied women the right to vote by confining voting rights to &quot;male citizens&quot;. This was rendered unenforceable by the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which provided suffrage to women effective in 1920; nevertheless, the section remained as part of the state constitution until Amendment 579 was substituted, which contained no reference to gender.

Section 182 had disqualified from registering or voting all &quot;idiots and insane persons&quot;, and persons who married interracially, or were convicted of &quot;crime against nature&quot; (homosexuality) or vagrancy. This section has also been struck down as unconstitutional.

===Size and local relevance===
The state legislature has passed numerous amendments to legislate issues that apply only to one or a few counties, as can be seen from the following examples:

* Mosquito control taxes in Mobile County (Amendment 351), which was later amended by Amendment 361 to remove a single word (&quot;tangible&quot;), then further amended by Amendment 393 to expand it to &quot;other general health purposes&quot; so long as these purposes do not take more than 50% of the collected money.
* Boll weevil taxes on cotton growers (Amendment 449)
* Promotion of catfish (Amendment 492), soybeans (Twice, Amendment 315 and Amendment 401), cattle (Twice, Amendment 201 and Amendment 452), poultry (Twice, Amendment 214 and amended by Amendment 428), swine (Twice, Amendment 327 and Amendment 400), an omnibus amendment for peanuts, milk, and cotton (Amendment 388), grain (Amendment 453), sheep and goats (Amendment 715), and shrimp and seafood generally (Amendment 766).

=== Legality ===

The Alabama Constitution of 1901, Article 1, Section 2 states that &quot;That all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their benefit;  and that, therefore, they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to change their form of government in such manner as they may deem expedient.&quot; Article 1 Section 36 states: &quot;That this enumeration of certain rights shall not impair or deny others retained by the people;  and, to guard against any encroachments on the rights herein retained, we declare that everything in this Declaration of Rights is excepted out of the general powers of government, and shall forever remain inviolate.&quot; As a result, Article 1 of the Alabama Constitution of 1901 cannot be edited or altered by the legislature, as the abilities of the legislature are based on the general powers delegated in the document and do not include the ability to change Article 1. In order to alter Article 1 of the state constitution, it is necessary to convene a constitutional convention and after the proposed constitution is published, to call an election where the voters of the state can vote to accept the proposed constitution as written. 

Note that the 2022 recompilation act is essentially identical to the delegated authority exercised by the state Secretary of State where the Secretary takes the text of an Act as passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor and reformats the text into a hierarchical form recognized in The Code of Alabama of 1975. In jurisprudence, the Code citations are used to refer to the original Act to resolve questions before the court. This is because The Code of Alabama of 1975 is organized to be readable and indexable. The courts have held that when two sections of The Code of Alabama conflict, the more recently edited part takes precedence under the accepted assumption that the legislature is infallible. The basis for organizing the code thusly is written in Section 1-1-14 of The Code of Alabama of 1975:

SECTION 1-1-14 Classification and organization of Code; notes and catchlines of sections not part of law.

(a) The classification and organization of the titles, chapters, articles, divisions, subdivisions and sections of this Code, and the headings thereto, are made for the purpose of convenient reference and orderly arrangement, and no implication, inference or presumption of a legislative construction shall be drawn therefrom.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the descriptive headings or catchlines immediately preceding or within the text of the individual sections of this Code, except the section numbers included in the headings or catchlines immediately preceding the text of such sections, do not constitute part of the law, and shall in no manner limit or expand the construction of any such section. All historical citations and notes set out in this Code are given for the purpose of convenient reference, and do not constitute part of the law.

<text>Sir Neil Elliott Lewis (27 October 1858 – 22 September 1935), Australian politician, was Premier of Tasmania on three occasions. He was also a member of the first Australian federal ministry, led by Edmund Barton.

==Early life==
Lewis was born in Hobart, son of Neil Lewis, a merchant, and his wife Anne Maria, &quot;née&quot; Cox. N. E. Lewis was the grandson of Richard Lewis (government auctioneer) and nephew of David Lewis, colonial treasurer 1878–79.

Educated at the Hobart High School, Lewis took the diploma of associate of arts with gold medal, and was awarded a Tasmanian scholarship. Lewis then attended Balliol College, Oxford University graduating B.A., 1882 and M.A. &amp; B.C.L. in 1885. He was admitted as a barrister in London in 1883 and returned to Tasmania where he was admitted as a barrister in December 1885 and commenced a private practice.

==Political career==
Lewis was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly at the 1886 election and remained a member of parliament until 1903. During this time he represented conservative interests and policies in opposition to liberals such as Philip Fysh, Sir Edward Braddon and Andrew Inglis Clark. He served in Henry Dobson&#x27;s ministry from 1892 until 1894 as Attorney-General, and was Leader of the Opposition 1894–1899. He was also an ardent federalist, having accompanied his predecessor as Premier, Sir Edward Braddon, as part of the Tasmanian delegation to the 1897–1898 convention.
In early October 1899, following a number of scandals affecting members of his Ministry, Braddon lost a vote of confidence on the floor of Parliament and was obliged to resign, and Lewis became Premier of Tasmania on 12 October 1899. He served in this role until 1903, encouraging producing interests and endeavouring to find fresh markets. Lewis was appointed as Minister without Portfolio in the first federal ministry under Edmund Barton in January 1901. However, he decided not to stand for election to the Federal Parliament in March. Lewis and Sir James Dickson are the only people to have held ministerial office in an Australian federal government without ever being a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. Lewis was the last surviving member of the inaugural Barton Cabinet.

At the 1903 election, Lewis&#x27; seat of Richmond was abolished, and he failed to win the new seat of Central Hobart; the only time a Tasmanian premier has been defeated in a general election. Lewis failed in a second attempt in 1906, but won one of the Denison seats under the statewide Hare-Clark system at the 1909 election—ironic in light of his ardent opposition to the system. Lewis was to serve in Parliament for another 13 years.

Lewis was again Premier of Tasmania in 1909, and again from 1909 to 1912. During these times he also held the post of Attorney-General. After leaving politics in 1922, he became Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania 1933–1935 and was the first president of the Tasmanian Amateur Athletic Association. Lewis was vice-chancellor of the University of Tasmania in 1903–1909 and chancellor in 1924–1933. By the time of his death in 1935 he was the last Dominion or self-governing colonial head of government of the Victorian era alive.

==Honours==
Lewis was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) 15 May 1901, in preparation of the forthcoming royal visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary). The following year he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

==Family==
He married, in 1896, Lina Henrietta Youl, daughter of Charles Youl, JP, and granddaughter of Sir James Arndell Youl, KCMG. They had two sons.

<text>The Ifni War, sometimes called the Forgotten War in Spain (&quot;la Guerra Olvidada&quot;), was a series of armed incursions into Spanish West Africa by Moroccan insurgents that began in November 1957 and culminated with the abortive siege of Sidi Ifni.

The city of Sidi Ifni had been ceded to the Spanish Empire in 1860 at the end of the Hispano-Moroccan War. After Morocco achieved independence in 1956, it sought to claim Spain&#x27;s remaining possessions in West Africa. Violent demonstrations against Spanish rule broke out in Ifni in April 1957, and in October Moroccan militias began converging near the territory. Moroccan forces attacked in November, forcing the Spanish to abandon most of the territory and retreat to a defensive perimeter around Ifni. Supplied by the Spanish Navy from the sea, the Spanish garrison was able to resist the siege, which lasted into June 1958. In Spanish Sahara, Moroccan units, now reorganised as the Moroccan Army of Liberation, engaged in heavy fighting with Spanish forces at El Aaiún and Edchera. By February 1958, a joint Spanish and French offensive had driven the Moroccans out of Spanish Sahara.

Hostilities ceased in April 1958 (although small skirmishes still occurred) with the Treaty of Angra de Cintra, signed by the Spanish and Moroccan governments, by which Cape Juby and most of the Ifni territory were transferred to Morocco. The city of Sidi Ifni remained in Spanish possession until 1969, when, under international pressure, it was relinquished to Morocco.

==Background==

The city of Sidi Ifni was ceded to the Spanish Empire in 1860 by Treaty of Wad Ras, but was not occupied until 1934. The following decades of Franco-Spanish collaboration resulted in the establishment and extension of the Spanish protectorate south of the city in Cape Juby. In 1946, Spain&#x27;s coastal and inland colonies were consolidated as Spanish West Africa.

When Morocco regained independence from France and Spain in 1956, the country expressed keen interest in all of Spain’s remaining colonial possessions in Morocco, claiming that they were historically and geographically all part of Moroccan territory. Sultan Mohammed V encouraged efforts to re-capture the land and personally funded anti-Spanish guerillas to claim Ifni back for Morocco.

==Outbreak==
Violent demonstrations against Spanish rule erupted in Ifni on 10 April 1957, followed by civil strife and widespread killings of those loyal to Spain. In response, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco dispatched two battalions of the Spanish Legion, Spain&#x27;s elite fighting force, to El Aaiún in Saguia el-Hamra in June.

Spanish military mobilisation resulted in the Royal Moroccan Army converging near Ifni. On 23 November 1957, two villages on the outskirts of Sidi Ifni, Goulimine and Bouizakarne, were occupied by 1,500 Moroccan soldiers (&quot;Moujahidine&quot;).

The encirclement of Ifni was the beginning of the Ifni War. Two more Legion battalions reached Spanish Sahara before the opening of hostilities.

===Storming of Ifni===
On 21 November, Spanish intelligence in Ifni reported that attacks were imminent by Moroccans and local tribes operating out of Tafraout. Two days later, Spanish lines of communication were cut, and a force of 2,000 Moroccans stormed Spanish garrisons and armories in and around Ifni.

Although the Moroccan drive into Sidi Ifni was repulsed, two nearby Spanish outposts were abandoned in the face of Moroccan attacks and many others remained under heavy siege.

====Tiluin====
At , 60 &quot;Tiradores de Ifni&quot; (locally recruited indigenous infantry with Spanish officers and specialist personnel) struggled to hold off a force of several hundred Moroccans. On 25 November, a relief attempt was authorised. Five CASA 2.111 bombers (Spanish-built variants of the Heinkel He 111) bombed enemy positions, while an equal number of CASA 352 transports (Spanish-built versions of the Junkers Ju 52/3m) dropped a force of 75 paratroopers into the outpost. The following months saw Spanish troops retreat from the territory to a defensive perimeter around Sidi Ifni.

On 3 December, soldiers of the Spanish Legion&#x27;s 6th battalion (VI Bandera) arrived, breaking the siege and retaking the airfield. All military and civilian personnel were then evacuated overland to Sidi Ifni.

====Telata====
The relief of Telata was less successful. Leaving Sidi Ifni on 24 November aboard several old trucks, a platoon of the Spanish Legion paratroop battalion under Captain Ortiz de Zárate made slow progress through difficult terrain. This problem was compounded by frequent Moroccan ambushes, which by the next day had left several men wounded and forced the Spaniards off the road. On 26 November, food ran out. The Spanish, low on ammunition, resumed their advance, only to dig in again in the face of repeated enemy attacks.

Rations were dropped by air, but Spanish casualties continued to mount. One of the dead was Captain Ortiz de Zárate. On 2 December, a column of infantry, among them the erstwhile defenders of Telata, broke through the Moroccan lines and managed to escape encirclement. The survivors of the paratroop detachment reached Sidi Ifni once more on 5 December. The company had suffered two dead and fourteen wounded.

===Siege of Sidi Ifni===
Initial Moroccan and local tribes attacks had been generally successful. In the space of a fortnight, the Moroccans and their tribal allies had asserted control over most of Ifni, isolating inland Spanish units from the capital. Simultaneous attacks had been launched throughout Spanish Sahara, overrunning garrisons and ambushing convoys and patrols.

Consequently, Moroccan units, resupplied and greatly reinforced, tried to surround and besiege Sidi Ifni, hoping to incite a popular uprising. However, the Moroccans underestimated the strength of the Spanish defences. Supplied from the sea by the Spanish Navy and protected by kilometres of trenches and forward outposts, Sidi Ifni, boasting 7,500 defenders by 9 December, proved impregnable. The siege, lasting into June 1958, was uneventful and relatively bloodless, as Spain and Morocco both concentrated resources on Saharan theatres.

===Battle of Edchera===
In January 1958, Morocco redoubled its commitment to the Spanish campaign, reorganising all army units in Spanish territory as the &quot;Saharan Liberation Army&quot;.

On 12 January, a division of the Saharan Liberation Army attacked the Spanish garrison at El Aaiún. Beaten back and forced into retreat by the Spaniards, the army turned its efforts to the southeast. Another opportunity presented itself the next day at Edchera, where two companies of the 13th Legionnaire battalion were conducting a reconnaissance mission. Slipping unseen into the large dunes near the Spanish positions, the Moroccans opened fire.

Ambushed, the Legionnaires struggled to maintain cohesion, driving off attacks with mortar and small arms fire. The 1st platoon stubbornly denied ground to the Moroccans until heavy losses forced it to withdraw. Bloody attacks continued until nightfall, and were fiercely resisted by the Spanish, who inflicted heavy casualties. By nightfall, the Moroccans were too scattered and depleted of men to continue their assault, and retreated into the darkness.

===Operation Écouvillon===
In February 1958, a Franco-Spanish combined force launched an offensive that broke up the Moroccan Liberation Army. Between them, France and Spain deployed a joint air fleet of 150 planes. The Spanish were 9,000 strong and the French 5,000.

First to fall were the Moroccan mountain strongholds at Tan-Tan. Bombed from above and rocketed from below, the Liberation Army suffered 150 dead and abandoned its positions.

On 10 February, the 4th, 9th, and 13th Spanish Legion battalions, organised into a motorised group, drove the Moroccans from Edchera and advanced to Tafurdat and Smara.

The Spanish army at El Aaiún, in conjunction with French forces from Fort Gouraud, struck the Moroccans on 21 February, destroying Saharan Liberation Army concentrations between Bir Nazaran and Ausert.

==Aftermath==
On 2 April 1958, the governments of Spain and Morocco signed the Treaty of Angra de Cintra which was named after the large bay in the area.

Morocco obtained the region of Tarfaya (Cape Juby), between the river Draa and the parallel 27°40′, and Ifni (although legally Morocco only gained full control over the territory in 1969), excluding the colony of Spanish Sahara.

Spain retained possession of Sidi Ifni until 1969, when, while under some international pressure (resolution 2072 of the United Nations from 1965), it returned the territory to Morocco. Spain kept control of Spanish Sahara until the 1975 Green March prompted it to sign the Madrid Accords with Morocco and Mauritania; it withdrew from the territory in 1976 and Western Sahara was partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania.

<text>The Hong Kong Secondary Students Union (Chinese characters: 香港中學生聯盟) is a pro-democracy student organisation in Hong Kong established in August 2003 by some pro-democratic secondary school students of Hong Kong. Formed by various students&#x27; associations (SA&#x27;s) and students&#x27; councils (SC&#x27;s) of secondary schools, it is the third largest politically involved youth organisation in Hong Kong, after the Hong Kong Federation of Students and the Hong Kong Youth and Tertiary Students Association.

The HKSSU&#x27;s stated goals are to study social and political issues from a student&#x27;s perspective, to speak out on government policies affecting secondary school students, and to raise awareness and sense of responsibility among young people towards social and political issues. Activities include the annual Youth Conference in Hong Kong, as well as participation in various political demonstrations.

Advisors to the HKSSU include four barristers, one solicitor, twelve university professors and lecturers, two clergy, one reporter, one accountant, and two doctors.

==Political activism==
Secondary school students in Hong Kong were traditionally perceived as being indifferent to politics, until an ad hoc group of secondary students (中學生關注基本法第23條立法聯盟) called about 3000 students to take part in the political demonstration in 2003 against Article 23 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Basic Law, after noticing heated discussions among students about the proposed legislation. After the demonstration, the ad hoc group reorganised itself and became a registered organisation under the name Hong Kong Secondary Students Union.

===Political demonstrations===
HKSSU has been active in many political demonstrations since its inception, including:
*the pro-democracy demonstration demanding universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1 January 2004;
*the demonstration against the interpretation of Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress on 11 April 2004;
*the pro-democracy demonstration demanding universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 on 1 July 2004;
*the pro-democracy demonstration demanding universal suffrage in 2007 and 2008 on 23 January 2005;
*the demonstration on 17 April 2005 against the history revisionism in Japanese textbooks;
*the demonstration against the interpretation of Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress on 24 April 2005;
*the rally on 31 May 2005 commemorating the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989;
*the pro-democracy demonstration demanding universal suffrage on 2007 and 2008 on 1 July 2005;
*the pro-democracy demonstration demanding a timetable of democratisation on 4 December 2005 and
*18 March 2007 protest.

Despite HKSSU&#x27;s success to mobilise a large number of students in the first 1 July Rally in 2003, it seemed unable to call such a great number of students to join later demonstrations, and people who marched in the name of the union were mostly either members of the executive committee or core members. Many teenagers did participate in the demonstrations, but they did not follow the union.

Nevertheless, HKSSU did participate in most of the protests organised by the pro-democracy camp, including as the anti–Tiananmen massacre protests, not only for expressing the students&#x27; voice, but also for raising funds to keep the union running.

===Other political involvements===
Besides participating in political demonstrations, the HKSSU has also been active in other political activities, including
*participating in various public discussion forums; and
*organising and participating in promotional events to encourage voter turnout.

==Other activities==
The HKSSU was also involved in other activities, including conducting a survey among secondary school students on educational issues (funding cuts in particular) in December 2003; and the issue of various position papers on mostly educational policies. 

On 1 January 2005, they joined a donation campaign raised by the pro-democracy camp, raising funds for people affected by tsunami of South Asia. They established counters in Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, and successfully raised more than $70000.

Besides, they also organise the Youth Conference every year.

==Youth Conference==

The Youth Conference is held annually by HKSSU in Hong Kong.

===Youth Conference 2004===
YC 2004 was co-organized by the HKSSU, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM) and Hong Kong Democratic Development Network (HKDDN), with the purpose of:
* training for critical thinking, debating and communicating skills,
* agglomerating the united power of youths,
* making youths more concerned about public affairs,
* learning about the Hong Kong Children&#x27;s Council.

For the organising committees, many walk-in teenagers, as well as some Executive Committees of the union who were F.5 or F.7. The director of this year was Kitty Ng, the chairlady of HKSSU.

More than 160 students from different schools applied for attending this conference, and 85 of them were chosen to participate in the activity. A pre-camp workshop was held on 21 July 2004 in Esther Lee Building of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. A 5-day camp was held on 25 July – 29 July 2004, at Shaw College and a mock debate was held in Legco.

===Youth Conference 2005===
This year, the focus was put on the theme of &quot;&quot;Democratic School&quot;, together with some concepts about children rights. It was jointly organised by HKSSU, HKHRM, and Hong Kong Democratic Development Network (HKDDN).

The organising committees were mainly filled by some non-EXCO Members of HKSSU, together with staff of HKHRM and HKDDN. The directors of Youth Conference 2005 were Ian Leung of HKSSU, Kit Chan of HKHRM and Chris Lo of HKDDN.

A 4-day camp was held on 1 August – 4 August 2005, at Chung Chi College of CUHK. A post-camp workshop was held the City University of Hong Kong on 13 August and the mock debate was held in Legco on 20 August.

===Youth Conference 2006===

The Executive Committee decided to organise another Youth Conference this summer, with the theme of &quot;unequal distribution of wealth&quot;. It was jointly organised by HKSSU, HKHRM, and Hong Kong Democratic Development Network (HKDDN).

The organising committees were mainly filled by some non-EXCO Members &amp; EXCO Members of HKSSU, together with staff of HKHRM and HKDDN. The chairpersons of Youth Conference 2006 were Ben Chung Kam Lun of HKSSU, Valerie Chan Wing Yin of HKHRM .

A 4-day camp was held on 24 July – 27 July 2006, at |uc United College of CUHK. A workshop was held on 12 August 2006 at the HKPTU headquarters and a mock debate.

==Controversies==
===Independence===
The union claims to be independent in finance and the administration, and is not sponsored by any political parties. However Human Rights Monitor (hereafter short-termed as HRM) and the Democratic Development Network (hereafter short-termed as DDN) were just too close to the top-profile members of the Union. In 2005, the two factions supporting HRM and DDN respectively started a destructive power struggle, which in fact pushed the Social Democrats to power. The HRM and Social Democratic alliance remained in power until the conservatives took power in November 2006.

The Human Rights Monitor is being accused by conservatives and Social Democrats to be &quot;too involved&quot; in union affairs. Even for the liberals, some former executive committee members were quoted to have said that the union would eventually become a puppet of HRM if the Union could not maintain its independence. 

Since the conservatives took power, co-operation and communication between HRM and the Union became more or less symbolic. Mistrust and discontent rose between both organisations.

===Factional Problems===
The union faced with serious factional problems, with two major power struggles since its establishment in 2003. Factional problems hindered the future development of the Union.

<text>The 24-posture Simplified Form of tai chi, () sometimes called the [[Beijing]] or Peking form for its place of origin, is a short version of tai chi composed of twenty-four unique movements.

==History==
The form was the result of an effort by the Chinese Sports Committee, which, in 1956, brought together four tai chi teachers—Chu Guiting, Cai Longyun, Fu Zhongwen, and Zhang Yu—to create a simplified form of tai chi as exercise for the masses. Some sources suggests that the form was structured in 1956 by master Li Tianji (李天骥). The creators truncated the traditional family style tai chi forms to 24 postures; taking about six minutes to perform and to give the beginner an introduction to the essential elements of tai chi, yet retain the traditional flavor of traditional longer hand forms (in general, 88-108 postures). Henceforth, this form was avidly promoted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China for general exercise, and was also taught to internees in Communist &quot;re-education&quot; camps. Due to this official promotion, the 24-form is most likely the tai chi form with the most practitioners in China and the world over (though no surveys have been performed).

<text>He Weifang (born July 17, 1960; ) is a Chinese legal scholar and a former professor at Peking University. He has advocated for the reform of China&#x27;s judicial system, and has argued that the Chinese Communist Party is an unregistered and therefore an illegal organization in China.

== Education ==
He earned a B.A. at Southwest University of Political Science &amp; Law, and an LL.M at Peking College of Political Science and Law (former China University of Political Science and Law).

== Academic career ==
He was an associate professor in China University of Political Science and Law from 1985 to 1995, then become a professor and Ph.D. adviser at Peking University.

Since 1992, he has been advocating for the reform of China&#x27;s judicial system. He has authored many papers on the importance of modernizing China&#x27;s judicial system, earning him the nickname &quot;Justice He&quot;. His works include &quot;The Judicial Ideals and Institutions&quot; and &quot;The Ways to Carry Justice&quot;.

Because of his public support and signing for Liu Xiaobo&#x27;s Charter 08, his position at Peking University became untenable and he was forced to resign. In 2008, he accepted a job offer to be the dean of the law school of Zhejiang University. However, the Chinese Communist Party forced the school to withdraw the job offer, and He was instead given a position in the remote city of Shihezi in Xinjiang. Richard McGregor, author of &quot;The Party: The Secret World of China&#x27;s Communist Rulers&quot;, said that this was &quot;a deliberately humiliating transfer, akin to a Harvard Law School professor being reassigned to a small community college in rural Texas.&quot;

On October 6, 2010, He Weifang gave a speech at Stockholm University, concerning reform of Chinese Court Organization Law and freedom of speech.

He retired in July 2023 after a near 40-year academic career.

<doc id="1221258" wikidata="Q2906950" url="?curid=1221258" title="Paul Reichmann">
<text>Paul (Moshe Yosef) Reichmann (‎; 27 September 1930 – 25 October 2013) was a Canadian businessman and member of the Reichmann family. He is best known for his leadership of the Olympia &amp; York real estate development company.

==Formative years==
Reichmann was born in Vienna in 1930 to Samuel Reichmann, a poultry farmer, and his wife Renée. His parents were Orthodox Jews from a small town in Hungary, but his father had risen to prominence in Vienna as a successful merchant. Paul was the fifth of six children.

The family escaped the Nazi occupation of Austria unintentionally. They had left the country on the day of Anschluss to visit Samuel&#x27;s father in Hungary who had suffered a stroke. Abandoning their lives in Vienna, they made their way from Hungary to the neutral Moroccan city of Tangier
 In Tangier, the family prospered as Samuel became a major currency trader. After the war Paul left home to study Judaism first in Britain and then in Israel, and his parents hoped that he would become a teacher. In 1955 he married Lea Feldman.

==Rising success==
In 1956, Reichmann followed his family to Canada, where three of his brothers — Edward, Louis and Ralph — had established the Olympia Floor &amp; Wall Tile Co, and his brother, Albert, had launched York Factory Developments.

Reichmann fell into property after building a new warehouse for the Toronto tile company. He got the warehouse built for $70,000, selling a year later for a $34,000 profit. He co-founded Olympia &amp; York with his brothers Albert and Ralph in 1958.

Soon the company was building such facilities for others. In 1964, Olympia and York was founded as a separate building and property development firm.

The firm was soon profitable, and expanded rapidly. It also accepted difficult projects, including the construction of First Canadian Place, Canada&#x27;s tallest building, built in 1975. The company expanded to New York City and by the mid-1980s it was the largest developer in the world, and
Forbes magazine ranked them the fourth richest family in the world in 1991, worth $12.8bn.

Despite his success, Paul Reichmann lived relatively modestly, described as living in a comfortable home in Toronto, and driving an old Cadillac. He remained very private and unwilling to talk to the press. He retained his strong religious views, and used much of his fortune to support his religion. In Toronto he built a number of schools and synagogues which became the centre of a thriving Orthodox community. Shunning most luxuries, his one personal indulgence was collecting rare and valuable Jewish texts. Pursuant to Jewish law, all of Olympia and York&#x27;s construction projects halted on the Jewish Sabbath and all holy days.

==Troubles==
The company ran into severe trouble in the early 1990s. It was due in part to a general decline in the world economy, but the company was truly brought low by the Canary Wharf project. It was the world&#x27;s largest property development, but remained half empty. Reichmann had taken the project as a major gamble. He had been impressed by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s reforms and obtained a personal promise from her that she would help the project, most importantly by extending the London Underground to reach it.

In Canada, Reichmann&#x27;s once sterling reputation also began to suffer. In 1985 the company had bought Gulf Canada Resources in a deal that included some $300 million in tax breaks. Many Canadians were infuriated that a massive corporation had been given such a lucrative deal. &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine also published a highly critical article on the Reichmanns. The family took offence at allegations that Samuel Reichmann had aided the Nazis with illegal smuggling operations during the Second World War. The family sued the magazine for an unprecedented $102 million. They were successful, and &quot;Toronto Life&quot; published a full retraction.

In 1992, as Olympia and York collapsed under some $20 billion in debt, Reichmann lost most of his family fortune.

==Recovery and retirement==
Despite these setbacks, Reichmann successfully rebuilt a small portion of his empire. This included setting up a partnership with George Soros, Lawrence Tisch and Michael Price.

Along with investors such as Al-Waleed bin Talal, a consortium paid $1.2 billion for a controlling stake in Canary Wharf, from a third party in charge of the property&#x27;s administration. Reichmann was hired as chairman. As Sandy Weill stated, Reichmann was hired because, he &quot;...really came up with that whole concept and built it, and got overleveraged and lost it...he knew where every screw was, where every nail was, he knew and loved the operation better than anyone else...&quot; Canary Wharf went public in 1999.

During 2004, a takeover battle began for the Canary Wharf Group in which Reichmann eventually sided with Canadian developer Brascan to attempt a purchase of the company. During this process, he resigned his position on the Board. In March 2005, a consortium of investors led by Morgan Stanley under the banner of Songbird Estates purchased Canary Wharf Group, and Reichmann was therefore no longer involved with Canary Wharf on a day-to-day basis. Reichmann, at the time 75, announced that he intended to retire from business and sold many of his property holdings.

==Return to business activity==

In September 2006, Reichmann announced that he was bored with retirement and that he would be setting up a new $4 billion fund, based in Toronto, with offices in Great Britain and the Netherlands.

==Death==
Paul Reichmann died at the age of 83 in Toronto on 25 October 2013.
His funeral took place Saturday night, 26 October 2013, at the Bais Yaakov Elementary School (15 Saranac Boulevard), in Toronto. He was buried in Jerusalem, in Har Hamenuchot cemetery.

<text>Reeltime Pictures Ltd is a British film, television and video production company and a distributor of the films of other companies, founded in 1984 by Keith Barnfather.

As well as producing corporate and business television, it has made a number of broadcast documentary series including &quot;Lost Trains of Cyprus&quot; and &quot;Phoenix – A Story from the Diaspora&quot;.

The company is also known for its many documentaries about the long-running television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (Barnfather was a founding member of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society) and in particular for &quot;Myth Makers&quot;, a series of interviews with people associated with the making of the series. Many of these programs were hosted by actor Nicholas Briggs, who provided the voice of the Daleks in the 2005 series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Reeltime Pictures also pioneered a technique of creating direct-to-video &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs, despite the BBC&#x27;s close guarding of the series, by building the spin-offs around incidental characters and monsters licensed directly from the writers who created them. Their first effort, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Wartime&quot;, was a small-scale piece built around Sergeant Benton of UNIT, a recurring character from the 1970s. In 1987, Reeltime produced &quot;Myth Runner&quot;, a parody of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; written, directed by and starring Briggs, featuring outtakes from the &quot;Myth Makers&quot; video series.

Later and more ambitious productions include &quot;Mindgame&quot;, &quot;Downtime&quot;, and &quot;Dæmos Rising&quot;. Despite its non-BBC-licensed status, a novelisation of &quot;Downtime&quot; was released as part of the BBC-licensed Virgin Missing Adventures &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off novels. The narrative of &quot;Downtime&quot; was expanded to incorporate the Doctor, a character missing from the video version for copyright reasons, with the narrative of the original production forming the middle third of the novel.

The success of these ventures inspired and opened the door for later releases by BBV and Big Finish Productions with storylines featuring characters and races from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, but not necessarily the Doctor himself (although BBV produced two series featuring Doctor-like characters portrayed by Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, while Big Finish also obtained a license that allowed them to feature the Doctor).

The company continues to output a wide variety of programming, including patient information films for Moorfields Eye Hospital.

==Video dramas==
*&quot;Wartime&quot; (1988) – the first independent spin-off production from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and the only one released while the series was still broadcasting. The storyline features UNIT soldier John Benton finding himself trapped in an alternate reality.
*&quot;Downtime&quot; (1995) – more popular characters were revived, as The Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney), Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling) all reprised their roles. The Yeti also made a comeback. The story also introduced the character of the Brigadier&#x27;s daughter Kate who later appeared in the official series from the Eleventh doctor onwards.
*&quot;Mindgame&quot; (1998) – a Sontaran, a Draconian and a Human are trapped together by an unknown enemy. Sophie Aldred, who had played Ace in Doctor Who, stars alongside the villainous Sontarans and Draconians.
*&quot;Lust in Space&quot; (1998) – a film in which features fictionalised versions of Katy Manning, Sophie Aldred and Nicholas Briggs and asks the question &quot;Is &quot;Doctor Who&quot; sexist?&quot;.

<doc id="1221264" wikidata="Q11665200" url="?curid=1221264" title="HMS Hussar (1894)">
<text>HMS &quot;Hussar&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1894 and served in the Mediterranean between 1896 and 1905 before being used for fishery protection. During the Dardanelles campaign of 1915 her commanding officer and two of her ship&#x27;s company won the Victoria Cross. She was broken up in 1921.

==Design==
Ordered under the Naval Defence Act of 1889, which established the &quot;Two-Power Standard&quot;, the class was contemporary with the first torpedo boat destroyers. With a length overall of , a beam of and a displacement of 1,070 tons, these torpedo gunboats were not small ships by the standard of the time; they were larger than the majority of World War I destroyers. &quot;Hussar&quot; was engined by Hawthorn Leslie and Company with two sets of vertical triple-expansion steam engines, two locomotive-type boilers, and twin screws. This layout produced , giving her a speed of . She carried between 100 and 160 tons of coal and was crewed by 120 sailors and officers.

==Armament==
When built &quot;Hussar&quot; acquired a different armament from the rest of the class; she was fitted with one (instead of two) QF gun, one (instead of four) 6-pounder guns and two additional 12-pounder guns. Her primary weapon was five 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, with two reloads. On conversion to a minesweeper in 1914 two of the five torpedo tubes were removed.

==History==

&quot;Hussar&quot; served on the Mediterranean Station between 1896 and 1905. During part of her time there, she operated in the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;), Imperial Russian Navy, and Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897-1898 Greek Christian uprising against the Ottoman Empire′s rule in Crete. On 6 November 1898, the last Ottoman forces on Crete, supervised by members of the crews of the British battleships and , embarked on &quot;Hussar&quot; for transportation to Salonica, bringing 229 years of Ottoman occupation of Crete to an end.

Lieutenant Commander Marcus Rowley Hill was appointed in command of &quot;Hussar&quot; on 11 April 1899. In early February 1900 she left Malta homeward bound, and later that month arrived at Devonport, where she paid off on 12 March. She was re-commissioned by Lieutenant Adolphus Huddlestone Williamson the same day, and returned to the Mediterranean. In June 1902 she visited Alexandria, in October that year she was at Syracuse, Sicily, and late that year she was at Port Said and visited the Red Sea.

===Yacht to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean===
In 1907 &quot;Hussar&quot; had her armament removed and was converted to become the yacht and despatch vessel for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.

===Fitted as a minesweeper===
In 1914 &quot;Hussar&quot; was converted into a minesweeper, which was the fate of many such torpedo gunboats.

===Dardanelles (1915)===
In February 1915, Commander Edward Unwin took command of &quot;Hussar&quot;. For the landing at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915, Unwin took command of the steamer SS &quot;River Clyde&quot;. Unwin received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the landing, as did two of his crew from &quot;Hussar&quot; who were also on &quot;River Clyde&quot;, Able Seaman William Williams and Seaman George Samson.

==Disposal==
&quot;Hussar&quot; was initially sold in December 1920, but was resold on 13 July 1921 to L Gatt, of Malta for breaking up.

<doc id="1221265" wikidata="Q1756121" url="?curid=1221265" title="Macquarie Harbour Penal Station">
<text>The Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, a former British colonial penal settlement, established on Sarah Island, Macquarie Harbour, in the former Penal colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, now Tasmania, operated between 1822 and 1833. The settlement housed male convicts, with a small number of women housed on a nearby island. During its 11 years of operation, the penal colony achieved a reputation as one of the harshest penal settlements in the Australian colonies. The former penal station is located on the Sarah Island that now operates as a historic site under the direction of the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service.

==Rationale for establishment==

The penal station was established as a place of banishment within the Australian colonies. It took the worst convicts, those who had reoffended and those who had escaped from other settlements. The isolated land was ideally suited for its purpose. It was separated from the mainland by the wide expanse of river, surrounded by a mountainous wilderness and was hundreds of miles away from the colony&#x27;s other settled areas. The only seaward access was through a treacherous narrow channel known as Hells Gates.

Strong tidal currents resulted in the deaths of many convicts before they even reached the settlement owing to ships foundering in the narrow rocky channel. The surveyor who mapped Sarah Island concluded that the chances of escape were &quot;next to impossible&quot;. Neighbouring Grummet Island, a small island to the Northeast, was used for solitary confinement.

Lieutenant-Governor William Sorell wanted the new penal colony to be economically viable. It could then reimburse the British government for the expense of its establishment. The island was cleared soon after the arrival of the convicts and their Governor. However, this exposed the settlement to the howling gales of the roaring forties, so it was necessary to build a wall from Huon Pine to provide shelter. 
Convicts spent most of their waking hours, often up to their necks in water, cutting timber and preparing it for rafting down the river. Lashings were common and were to be administered by another convict. If they were not administered with sufficient severity, the convict who had been given responsibility for administering the lashes was also lashed. The severity of the lashings was sufficient to cause death in some cases. If a convict appeared in danger of death, a doctor could intervene, the lashing would cease (for a time) and be resumed once the convict was deemed to have recovered sufficiently for it to continue. 
After a time, a Scottish shipbuilder named David Hoy, who had heard of the remarkable properties of Huon Pine for shipbuilding came, voluntarily, to the island. He negotiated with the convicts, allowing them rations of rum and tobacco, and more weatherproof sleeping quarters in exchange for their cooperation. For a short period, it was the largest shipbuilding operation in the Australian colonies. Chained convicts had the task of cutting down Huon pine trees and rafting the logs down the river. 

===Military Personnel===
Once the establishment of the penal station at Macquarie Harbour was decided upon, Lieutenant John Cuthbertson of the 48th Regiment was appointed as its commandant, magistrate and justice of the peace on 8 December 1821. Four days later he left Hobart with Captain James Kelly, harbourmaster, Surveyor George Evans and Surgeon Spence in the Sophia, accompanied by some 16 soldiers, their wives and children and 66 male and 8 female convicts in the Prince Leopold. Advice of his arrival and of the choice of Sarah Island for the headquarters of the new settlement was sent on 23 January 1822.
Sergeant George Waddy of the 48th Regiment was Commissariat Sergeant and second in command of the experimental penal settlement in 1821. His youngest child Jane Waddy was born on Sarah Island in 1822.

===Conditions===
As Sarah Island could not produce food, malnutrition, dysentery, and scurvy were often rampant among the convict population. The penal colony had to be supplied by sea. Living conditions were particularly bad in the early years of the settlement. The settlement was so crowded, convicts were unable to sleep on their backs in the communal barracks. Punishment involved solitary confinement and regular floggings - 9,100 lashes were given in 1823.

In 1824 a prisoner named Trenham stabbed another convict in order to be executed rather than face further imprisonment at Macquarie Harbour Penal Station.

It was finally closed in late 1833. Most of the remaining convicts were then relocated to Port Arthur.

==Escapes==
Despite its isolated location, a considerable number of convicts attempted to escape from the island. Bushranger Matthew Brady was among a party that successfully escaped to Hobart in 1824 after tying up their overseer and seizing a boat. James Goodwin was pardoned after his 1828 escape and was subsequently employed to make official surveys of the wilderness he had passed through. Sarah Island&#x27;s most infamous escapee was Alexander Pearce who managed to get away twice. On both occasions, he cannibalized his fellow escapees.

As the station was closing down, ten convicts remained to complete an unfinished brig. The convicts later hijacked the vessel and escaped to Chile. 

==Later use and current conditions==
The island was later used for pining purposes, and was known by the piners as Settlement Island, rather than Sarah Island, though it has since reverted to its original name.

The ruins of the settlement remain today as the &quot;Sarah Island Historic Site&quot; —part of the larger Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area—though they are not as well preserved as those at better-known Port Arthur. The island is accessible via ferries and charter boats operating out of the town of Strahan.

==In the media==
Sarah Island has been frequently featured in Australian literature and theatre, often representing the worst excesses of the British convict system.

Notable books include:

In Strahan, the main port and town on the shores of Macquarie Harbour today Australia&#x27;s longest running play &quot;The Ship that Never Was&quot; by Tasmanian author Richard Davey dramatises the Frederick escape, the last escape from the island. His book &quot;The Sarah Island Conspiracies - Being an account of twelve voyages to Macquarie Harbour and Sarah Island&quot; furthers understanding of the history and the recent archaeological work on the island.

The films &quot;The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce&quot; and &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; deal with one of the more notorious escapees.

Photography of the island and ruins have at various stages shown the ruins of the buildings:

: 1929 – 

==Known escapees==
* Mordecai Cohen, escaped in April 1823
* George Hammersley and James Woodward, escaped on 4 May 1824
* John Graham, John Germanston, and John McCarthy, escaped on 20 July 1825
* Matthew Brady
* Alexander Pearce
* Ten convicts, notably former whaler James Porter, in the Frederick escape

3 September 1830 five men ran away from the settlement, Richard Hutchinson, William Coventry, Patrick Fagan, Mathew Macavoy, and Broughton, and that they were upwards of thirty days before the two &#x27;survivors&#x27; surrendered themselves at Macguire&#x27;s Marsh near Osterley. On the eve of his execution, Broughton confessed to the murder and cannibalisation of Hutchinson and Coventry. He also implicated Macavoy in the crimes and alleged that Macavoy murdered Fagan despite his attempts to convince him not to

<doc id="1221268" wikidata="Q1195438" url="?curid=1221268" title="Dip slope">
<text>A dip slope is a topographic (geomorphic) surface which slopes in the same direction, and often by the same amount, as the true dip or apparent dip of the underlying strata. A dip slope consists of the upper surface of a resistant layer of rock, often called &quot;caprock&quot;, that is commonly only slightly lowered and reduced in steepness by erosion. Dip slopes form the backslopes of cuestas, homoclinal ridges, hogbacks, and flatirons. The frontslopes of such ridges consist of either an escarpment, a steep slope, or perhaps even a line of cliffs. Generally, cuestas and homoclinal ridges are asymmetrical in that their dip slopes are less steep than their escarpments. In the case of hogbacks and flatirons, the dip of the rocks is so steep that their dip slope approaches the escarpment in their steepness.
Dip slopes are the result of the differential erosion of strata of varying resistance to erosion that are dipping uniformly in one direction. In this case, strata, i.e. shale, mudstone, and marl, that are less resistant to erosion are preferentially eroded relative to stronger strata, i.e. sandstone, limestone, and dolomite, that are more resistant to erosion. As a result, the less resistant strata will be eroded away leaving the more resistant strata as a caprock forming the dip slope (backslope) of a ridge that slopes in the direction of caprock. When this happens to flat-lying beds, landforms such as plateaus, mesas, and buttes are formed. The erosion of tilted beds will form landforms called cuestas, homoclinal ridges, hogbacks, and flatirons. Plateaus, mesas, and buttes have flat tops, while cuestas and homoclinal ridges are asymmetrical (~flat) areas w/ridges. The less steep side (at the low point) is their dip slope (intersecting &#x27;ground&#x27; surface, and disappearing underground) and the steeper other side (the opposite, and at the high point) is their escarpment. In case of hogbacks, the steepness of the dip slope and escarpment will be about the same. Dip slopes can also be formed by igneous structures such as sills.

==Landslides==
Some dip slopes are quite prone to landslides, due to the dipping strata that underlie them. Large sheets of rock have a tendency to slide down dip slopes.

<text>Zhang Xiu (died 207) was a military general and minor warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. In 197, he clashed with the warlord Cao Cao, who was then the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Han central government, at the Battle of Wancheng and subsequent skirmishes. However, in 200, he heeded the suggestion from his adviser Jia Xu and surrendered to Cao Cao, who accepted his surrender and appointed him as a general. Having fought on Cao Cao&#x27;s side at the decisive Battle of Guandu against a rival warlord Yuan Shao and in the subsequent campaigns against Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs, Zhang Xiu made great contributions during his service under Cao Cao. In 207, he died en route to joining Cao Cao on a campaign against the Wuhuan tribes. The Han imperial court honoured with the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Ding&quot;.

==Life==
Zhang Xiu was from Zuli County (), Wuwei Commandery (), which is in present-day Jingyuan County, Gansu. He was a distant nephew of Zhang Ji, who served under the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo.

During the Liang Province rebellion, Zhang Xiu was still a minor county official at Zuli. A rebel from Jincheng by the name of Qu Sheng (麴胜) had killed an official of Zuli by the name of Liu Jun (刘隽); Zhang Xiu managed to kill Qu Sheng in return. This act won him the praise of many people in Zuli.

After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death in May 192, his former subjects, including Zhang Ji, waged a coup and took over the imperial capital Chang&#x27;an. For his part in the coup, Zhang Xiu was also promoted to General who Builds Loyalty () and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xuanwei ().

After Zhang Ji&#x27;s death, Zhang Xiu took over command of his troops and occupied Wan (宛; or Wancheng (); in present-day Nanyang, Henan). He allied himself with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province and a major warlord of the time. In 197, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, led his forces on campaigns against rival warlords. When he arrived at the banks of the Bai River (), Zhang Xiu promptly surrendered to him and was allowed to retain control over Wan.

Cao Cao then took Zhang Ji&#x27;s widow as a concubine, which angered Zhang Xiu. Cao Cao heard of Zhang Xiu&#x27;s displeasure and plotted to kill him. However, the plan was leaked and Zhang Xiu waged a surprise attack against Cao Cao, leading to the Battle of Wancheng. Cao Cao&#x27;s personal bodyguard Dian Wei died defending the front gate to the camp so that Cao Cao could escape through the back gate. In the hasty retreat, Cao Cao&#x27;s eldest son, Cao Ang, offered his own horse to his father, whose steed was felled by enemy arrows, and was killed by the pursuers. Cao Cao&#x27;s nephew Cao Anmin was also killed.

Henceafter, Cao Cao had sent forces to attack Zhang Xiu for years without success. In 200, however, Zhang Xiu heeded the suggestion from his adviser, Jia Xu, and surrendered to Cao Cao again. Cao Cao decided to put aside his past feud with Zhang Xiu and accept his surrender. He also proposed a marriage between his son Cao Jun and Zhang Xiu&#x27;s daughter.

Around the time, Cao Cao was at war with the northern warlord Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. Having performed well during the conflict, Zhang Xiu was soon promoted to General who Defeats the Qiang (). In 207, Zhang Xiu died at Liucheng (present-day Chaoyang, Liaoning) en route to join Cao Cao in a northern campaign against the Wuhuan tribes. The Han imperial court honoured him with the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Ding&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;steadfast marquis&quot;.

<text>The Union Cypress Company operated a three-story double-band sawmill in Melbourne, Florida, built in 1912. The small company town of Hopkins (now South Melbourne), named after its owner George W. Hopkins, was built at the site. The company built a private railroad, often known as the Union Cypress Company Railroad, west from a connection with the Florida East Coast Railway in Melbourne across the St. Johns River to Deer Park. From there, where the logging operation was based, branch lines fanned out into the bald cypress swamps.

Other stations along the line were Grass Mere or Omega, 1.5 miles east of the county line between Osceola County and Brevard County, Agnes, about a mile west of the St. Johns River, Alpha, just east of the St. Johns River, Patterson (now June Park), just east of Interstate 95 (SR 9), and Gagner (now West Melbourne), a couple miles from the east end.

The Kissimmee-Melbourne Road (part of the Dixie Highway, later SR 24, now US 192 (SR 500)), which opened in 1918, was closed in 1923 and 1924 for repairs. During that time, the company carried automobiles across the swamps for $1 each.

The mill burned down in August 1919, following a large fire that February in downtown Melbourne. A new fireproof mill was begun but never completed, and the company shut down in 1925 after George W. Hopkins died.

In 1924, the company received a contract to provide lumber for the first bridge between Titusville and Merritt Island.

The Foshee Manufacturing Company took over operations and rebuilt the railroad in 1928, but the Great Depression hit and put the operation out of business. The buildings and railroad were torn down and sold in 1932.

Many supports from the old trestle across the St. Johns River remain, as do a few of the old company buildings at the Melbourne end.

<doc id="1221281" wikidata="Q913288" url="?curid=1221281" title="Diapause">
<text>In animal dormancy, diapause is the delay in development in response to regular and recurring periods of adverse environmental conditions. It is a physiological state with very specific initiating and inhibiting conditions. The mechanism is a means of surviving predictable, unfavorable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought, or reduced food availability. Diapause is observed in all the life stages of arthropods, especially insects. 

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the pupae and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult monarch butterfly, &quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;. In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

Embryonic diapause, a somewhat similar phenomenon, occurs in over 130 species of mammals, possibly even in humans, and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes.

==Phases of insect diapause==
Diapause in insects is a dynamic process consisting of several distinct phases. While diapause varies considerably from one taxon of insects to another, these phases can be characterized by particular sets of metabolic processes and responsiveness of the insect to certain environmental stimuli. For example, &quot;Sepsis cynipsea&quot; flies primarily use temperature to determine when to enter diapause. Similarly, &quot;Chrysoperla plorabunda&quot; lacewings regulate their reproductive cycle using daylight length, with adults entering reproductive diapause when there are less than 12-13 hours of daylight. Diapause can occur during any stage of development in arthropods, but each species exhibits diapause in specific phases of development. Reduced oxygen consumption is typical as is reduced movement and feeding. In &quot;Polistes exclamans&quot;, a social wasp, only the queen is said to be able to undergo diapause.

===Comparison of diapause periods===
The sensitive stage is the period when stimulus must occur to trigger diapause in the organism. Examples of sensitive stage/diapause periods in various insects:
===Induction===
The induction phase occurs at a genetically predetermined stage of life, and occurs well in advance of the environmental stress. This sensitive stage may occur within the lifetime of the diapausing individual, or in preceding generations, particularly in egg diapause. During this phase, insects are responsive to external cues called token stimuli, which trigger the switch from direct development pathways to diapause pathways. Token stimuli can consist of changes in photoperiod, thermoperiod, or allelochemicals from food plants. These stimuli are not in themselves favourable or unfavourable to development, but they herald an impending change in environmental conditions.

===Preparation===
The preparation phase usually follows the induction phase, though insects may go directly from induction to initiation without a preparation phase. During this phase, insects accumulate and store molecules such as lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. These molecules are used to maintain the insect throughout diapause and to provide fuel for development following diapause termination. Composition of the cuticle may be altered by changing hydrocarbon composition and by adding lipids to reduce water loss, making the organism resistant to desiccation. Diapausing puparia of the flesh fly, &quot;Sarcophaga crassipalpis&quot;, increase the amount of cuticular hydrocarbons lining the puparium, effectively reducing the ability of water to cross the cuticle.

===Initiation===
Photoperiod is the most important stimulus initiating diapause. The initiation phase begins when morphological development ceases. In some cases, this change may be very distinct and can involve moulting into a specific diapause stage, or be accompanied by color change. Enzymatic changes may take place in preparation for cold hardening. For example, only diapausing adults of the fire bug, &quot;Pyrrhocoris apterus&quot;, have the enzymatic complement that allows them to accumulate polyhydric alcohols, molecules that help to lower their freezing points and thus avoid freezing. Insects may also undergo behavioural changes and begin to aggregate, migrate, or search for suitable overwintering sites.

===Maintenance===
During the maintenance phase, insects experience lowered metabolism and developmental arrest is maintained. Sensitivity to certain stimuli which act to prevent termination of diapause, such as photoperiod and temperature, is increased. At this stage, insects are unresponsive to changes in the environment that will eventually trigger the end of diapause, but they grow more sensitive to these stimuli as time progresses.

===Termination===
In insects that undergo obligate diapause, termination may occur spontaneously, without any external stimuli. In facultative diapausers, token stimuli must occur to terminate diapause. These stimuli may include chilling, freezing, or contact with water, depending on the environmental conditions being avoided. These stimuli are important in preventing the insect from terminating diapause too soon, for instance in response to warm weather in late fall. In the Edith&#x27;s checkerspot butterfly, individuals must receive enough sunlight in order to terminate the diapause stage and become a fully grown butterfly. Termination may occur at the height of unfavourable conditions, such as in the middle of winter. Over time, depth of diapause slowly decreases until direct development can resume, if conditions are favourable. Termination can also occur in specific time frames linked to reproductive periods, such as in the beetle &quot;Colaphellus bowringi:&quot; diapause ends for spring-reproducing beetles between late February and early April and for autumn-reproducing beetles between mid August and early October&quot;.&quot;

===Post-diapause quiescence===
Diapause frequently ends prior to the end of unfavourable conditions and is followed by a state of from which the insect can arouse and begin direct development, should conditions change to become more favourable. This allows the insect to continue to withstand harsh conditions while being ready to take advantage of good conditions as soon as possible.

==Regulation==
Diapause in insects is regulated at several levels. Environmental stimuli interact with genetic pre-programming to affect neuronal signalling, endocrine pathways, and, eventually, metabolic and enzymatic changes.

===Environmental===
Environmental regulators of diapause generally display a characteristic seasonal pattern. In temperate regions, photoperiod is the most reliable cues of seasonal change. This informs entry into reproductive diapause for many northern insects, including the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila montana.&quot; Depending on the season in which diapause occurs, either short or long days can act as token stimuli. Insects may also respond to changing day length as well as relative day length. Temperature may also act as a regulating factor, either by inducing diapause or, more commonly, by modifying the response of the insect to photoperiod. Insects may respond to thermoperiod, the daily fluctuations of warm and cold that correspond with night and day, as well as to absolute or cumulative temperature. This has been observed in many moth species including the Indian mealmoth, where individuals diapause in different developmental stages due to environmental temperature. Food availability and quality may also help regulate diapause. In the desert locust, &quot;Schistocerca gregaria&quot;, a plant hormone called gibberellin stimulates reproductive development. During the dry season, when their food plants are in senescence and lacking gibberellin, the locusts remain immature and their reproductive tracts do not develop.

===Neuroendocrine===
The neuroendocrine system of insects consists primarily of neurosecretory cells in the brain, the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata and the prothoracic glands. There are several key hormones involved in the regulation of diapause: juvenile hormone (JH), diapause hormone (DH), and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH).

Prothoracicotropic hormone stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce ecdysteroids that are required to promote development. Larval and pupal diapauses are often regulated by an interruption of this connection, either by preventing release of prothoracicotropic hormone from the brain or by failure of the prothoracic glands to respond to prothoracicotropic hormone.

The corpora allata is responsible for the production of juvenile hormone (JH). In the bean bug, &quot;Riptortus pedestris&quot;, clusters of neurons on the protocerebrum called the pars lateralis maintain reproductive diapause by inhibiting JH production by the corpora allata. Adult diapause is often associated with the absence of JH, while larval diapause is often associated with its presence.

In adults, absence of JH causes degeneration of flight muscles and atrophy or cessation of development of reproductive tissues, and halts mating behaviour. The presence of JH in larvae may prevent moulting to the next larval instar, though successive stationary moults may still occur. In the corn borer, &quot;Diatraea gradiosella&quot;, JH is required for the accumulation by the fat body of a storage protein that is associated with diapause.

Diapause hormone regulates embryonic diapause in the eggs of the silkworm moth, &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;. DH is released from the subesophageal ganglion of the mother and triggers trehalase production by the ovaries. This generates high levels of glycogen in the eggs, which is converted into the polyhydric alcohols glycerol and sorbitol. Sorbitol directly inhibits the development of the embryos. Glycerol and sorbitol are reconverted into glycogen at the termination of diapause.

==Tropical diapause==
Diapause in the tropics is often initiated in response to biotic rather than abiotic components. For example, food in the form of vertebrate carcasses may be more abundant following dry seasons, or oviposition sites in the form of fallen trees may be more available following rainy seasons. Also, diapause may serve to synchronize mating seasons or reduce competition, rather than to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions.

Diapause in the tropics poses several challenges to insects that are not faced in temperate zones. Insects must reduce their metabolism without the aid of cold temperatures and may be faced with increased water loss due to high temperatures. While cold temperatures inhibit the growth of fungi and bacteria, diapausing tropical insects still have to deal with these pathogens. Also, predators and parasites may still be abundant during the diapause period.

Aggregations are common among diapausing tropical insects, especially in the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. Aggregations may be used as protection against predation, since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus beetle, &quot;Stenotarsus rotundus&quot;, which forms aggregations of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. Relative humidity is increased within the aggregations and beetles experience less water loss, probably due to decreased surface area to volume ratios reducing evaporative water loss.

<doc id="1221296" wikidata="Q2106390" url="?curid=1221296" title="Potboiler">
<text>A potboiler or pot-boiler is a novel, play, opera, film, or other creative work of dubious literary or artistic merit, whose main purpose was to pay for the creator&#x27;s daily expenses—thus the imagery of &quot;boil the pot&quot;, which means &quot;to provide one&#x27;s livelihood.&quot; Authors who create potboiler novels or screenplays are sometimes called hack writers or hacks. Novels deemed to be potboilers may also be called pulp fiction, and potboiler films may be called &quot;popcorn movies.&quot;

==Usage==
If a serious playwright or novelist&#x27;s creation is deemed a potboiler, this has a negative connotation that suggests that it is a mediocre or inferior work.

===Historical examples===
*In 1854 &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot; used the term in the following sentence: &quot;He has not carelessly dashed off his picture, with the remark that &#x27;it will do for a pot-boiler&#x27;&quot;.
*Jane Scovell&#x27;s &quot;Oona:&quot; &quot;Living in the Shadows&quot; states that &quot;...the play was a mixed blessing. Through it O&#x27;Neill latched on to a perennial source of income, but the promise of his youth was essentially squandered on a potboiler.&quot;
*Lewis Carroll, in a letter to illustrator A. B. Frost in 1880, advises Frost not to spend his advance pay for his work on &quot;Rhyme? &amp; Reason?&quot; lest he be forced to &quot;do a &#x27;pot-boiler&#x27; for some magazine&quot; to make ends meet.
*A 1980s reviewer for &quot;Time&quot; condemned the novel &quot;Thy Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot;, by Andrew Greeley, as a &quot;putrid, puerile, prurient, pulpy potboiler&quot;.
*In the late 1990s, American author and newspaper reporter Stephen Kinzer wrote that reading a &quot;potboiler&quot; is &quot;a fine form of relaxation but not exactly mind-expanding.&quot;
*In an interview with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, writer David Schow described potboilers as fiction that &quot;stacks bricks of plot into a nice, neat line&quot;.

<doc id="1221306" wikidata="Q650884" url="?curid=1221306" title="Blew">
<text>&quot;Blew&quot; is a song by American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It is the first song on the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Bleach&quot;, released in June 1989 by Sub Pop. 

The song was re-released on Tupelo Records as the title track of a four-song EP in the United Kingdom in November 1989, where it charted at number 15 on the UK Indie Singles chart.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Blew&quot; was first performed live at the Community World Theatre in Tacoma, Washington, on March 19, 1988. This was also the first show the band played with their name as Nirvana.

The song was first recorded in the studio by Jack Endino at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle, Washington on June 11, 1988, during the recording sessions for what became the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Love Buzz&quot;. 

===&quot;Bleach&quot;===
A second studio version was recorded by Endino at Reciprocal in December 1988, and was released on &quot;Bleach&quot; on June 15, 1989.

The &quot;Bleach&quot; version of &quot;Blew&quot; was accidentally recorded one step lower than the band had intended, which contributed to what Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad called its &quot;extraordinarily heavy sound&quot;. Not realizing that they had already tuned to their favored D Standard tuning, the band tuned further down to Drop C on the first day of the sessions and recorded several songs in that tuning. As bassist Krist Novoselic recalled in a 2009 &quot;Seattle Times&quot; article, &quot;we came back the next day and decided the idea wasn&#x27;t so hot, and we recorded over most of it with things tuned back up a little. In fact, &#x27;Blew&#x27;, with that growly bass, is the only survivor of that experiment.&quot;

====&quot;Blew&quot; EP====
The &quot;Bleach&quot; version of &quot;Blew&quot; was re-released on the &quot;Blew&quot; EP in November 1989, along with the &quot;Bleach&quot; mix of &quot;Love Buzz&quot; and the previously-unreleased songs &quot;Been a Son&quot; and &quot;Stain&quot;, which had been recorded by Steve Fisk at Music Source in Seattle, Washington in September 1989. The band&#x27;s original plan had been to release an EP to promote their upcoming European tour, but the EP was delayed and released exclusively in the United Kingdom a few days before the final tourdate in London. However, the EP built on the interest the band had generated in the UK with &quot;Bleach&quot;, and was promoted by English DJ John Peel, who had also played &quot;Bleach&quot; on his influential show. The &quot;Blew&quot; EP eventually peaked at number 15 on the UK Indie chart.

===Post-&quot;Bleach&quot;===
&quot;Blew&quot; was one of only three songs from &quot;Bleach&quot;, along with &quot;About a Girl&quot; and &quot;School&quot;, that remained in the bands setlists until the end of their touring career. It was performed live for the final time in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994, as the second-to-last song preceding &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;.

==Composition and lyrics==
In his 1993 Nirvana biography &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, Azerrad described the song as having a &quot;theme of entrapment and control.&quot;

==Release and reception==
In 2009, Novoselic said that &quot;Blew&quot; was perhaps his favorite song on &quot;Bleach&quot; &quot;because it has a groove, and again, it&#x27;s the sole survivor of the Doom Pop experiment.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Blew&quot; at number 22 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2023, &quot;the A.V. Club&quot; ranked it at number 29 in their list of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;30 greatest songs.

==EP==
The &quot;Blew&quot; EP was released in November 1989 on Tupelo Records on 12-inch vinyl and CD. With a working title of &quot;Winnebago&quot;, the EP was originally intended as a release to promote an upcoming European tour, but due to production delays, the maxi-single ended up being released exclusively in the United Kingdom a few days before the tour&#x27;s completion.

Released exclusively in the UK, the EP was difficult to obtain elsewhere, with only 3,000 copies of the maxi-single pressed on 12-inch vinyl and CD. Both vinyl and CD counterfeit copies exist, with the vinyl copies varying in color. The official 12-inch vinyl was pressed only on black vinyl. The cover art was photographed by Cobain&#x27;s then-girlfriend Tracy Marander at a May 26, 1989 concert at the Green River Community College in Auburn, Washington. Marander shot the back cover photo as well.

&quot;Stain&quot; was re-released by DGC Records in December 1992, on the band&#x27;s rarities compilation, &quot;Incesticide&quot;. The &quot;Blew&quot; version of &quot;Been a Son&quot;, hailed by Kurt St. Thomas as the &quot;definitive take&quot; due to its trashy sound and pronounced bass solo, remained a rarity until it was re-released in October 2002 on the band&#x27;s first best-of compilation, &quot;Nirvana&quot;.

==Track listing==

*&quot;Blew&quot; and &quot;Love Buzz&quot; were previously released on Nirvana&#x27;s 1989 debut album &quot;Bleach&quot;, but &quot;Love Buzz&quot; was not included on the original 1989 UK version. In its place was &quot;Big Cheese&quot;, the B-side to the US &quot;Love Buzz&quot; single. Therefore, the &quot;Blew&quot; EP was the first time that &quot;Love Buzz&quot; was officially released in the UK. However, &quot;Love Buzz&quot; was included on the 1992 UK re-issue of &quot;Bleach&quot;.
*&quot;Been a Son&quot; was later released on the 2002 &quot;best-of&quot; compilation, &quot;Nirvana&quot;. An alternate version appeared on the 1992 compilation, &quot;Incesticide&quot;.
*&quot;Stain&quot; was later released on &quot;Incesticide&quot;.

<text>Mundzuk was a Hunnic chieftain, brother of the Hunnic rulers Octar and Rugila, and father of Bleda and Attila by an unknown consort. Jordanes in &quot;Getica&quot; recounts &quot;For this Attila was the son of Mundzucus, whose brothers were Octar and Ruas, who were supposed to have been kings before Attila, although not altogether of the same [territories] as he&quot;.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Mundzuk&quot; is disputed. It is recorded as &quot;Mundzucus&quot; by Jordanes, &quot;Mundiucus&quot; by Cassiodorus, &quot;Μουνδίουχος&quot; (Moundioukhos) by Priscus, and &quot;Μουνδίου&quot; (Moundiou) by Theophanes of Byzantium. A Germanic etymology was proposed by Karl Müllenhoff in the 19th century: he noted the similarity of the name&#x27;s second element to that of the Burgundian king Gundioc and the Frankish king Merovech. According to Gerhard Doerfer, the name can be derived from a Gothic &quot;*Mundiweihs&quot;, from &quot;mund-&quot; (protection) and &quot;weihs&quot; (battle). Gottfried Schramm rejects a Germanic origin for the name because Mundzuk must have been born before 373, when the Huns and Goths first came into contact.

Gyula Németh and László Rásonyi argued that the name is a transcription of Turkic &quot;munčuq&quot;, &quot;munʒuq&quot;, &quot;minʒaq&quot;, &quot;bunčuq&quot;, &quot;bonʒuq&quot;, &quot;mončuq&quot;, with the potential meanings of &quot;jewel, pearl, bead&quot; or &quot;flag&quot;. Gerhard Doerfer argues that this derivation is unlikely because in the oldest Turkic inscriptions this word is written beginning with a &quot;b&quot; (*&quot;bunčuq&quot;) rather than an &quot;m&quot;.

==Legacy==
Known as Bendegúz in Hungarian, he appears in Hungary&#x27;s national anthem as an ancestor of the Hungarians. In the years of 2003–2009, &quot;Bendegúz&quot; was the 54–66 most common male baby name in Hungary.

The name is also present in Croatian, forming the surname Mandžukić.

<text>Young Dr. Kildare is a 1938 American drama film directed by Harold S. Bucquet and starring Lew Ayres as Dr. James Kildare, an idealistic, freshly graduated medical intern, who benefits greatly from the wise counsel of his experienced mentor, Dr. Leonard Gillespie (played by Lionel Barrymore). The film was based on a story and characters created by author Frederick Schiller Faust, writing as Max Brand.

It is the second of a total of ten films featuring the &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; character, but the first made by MGM, the first starring Ayres, and the first film appearance of the Dr. Gillespie character. The first Kildare film, &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot; (1937), was made by Paramount, featured Joel McCrea in the title role, and was based on an earlier Faust character and story that did not include the crusty Gillespie. After &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot; failed to meet Paramount&#x27;s commercial expectations, MGM acquired the rights and worked with Faust to revise the character and storyline for greater viewer appeal, including the addition of Gillespie.

&quot;Young Doctor Kildare&quot; introduced the regulars working at Blair, including hospital administrator Dr. Carew (Walter Kingsford), nurses Molly Byrd (Alma Kruger) and Nosey Parker (Nell Craig), orderly Conover (George H. Reed), ambulance attendant Joe Wayman (Nat Pendleton), switchboard operator Sally (Marie Blake), and Mike Ryan (Frank Orth), proprietor of Sullivan&#x27;s Hospital Cafe.

Following the success of &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot;, MGM went on to make a total of nine Kildare films, plus an additional six films centering on Gillespie after Kildare had been phased out.

==Plot==
After graduating from medical school, Dr. James Kildare (Lew Ayres) returns to his small home town, where his proud parents Stephen (Samuel S. Hinds) and Martha Kildare (Emma Dunn) and childhood friend Alice Raymond (Lynne Carver) expect him to join his father in his medical practice. However, he is more ambitious, though he is unsure what he wants to do. He has accepted a job as an intern at Blair General, a large New York City hospital.

He and the other new interns are being greeted by the hospital&#x27;s administrator, Dr. Carew (Walter Kingsford), when the famous diagnostician Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore) bursts in and sizes up the newcomers. When Gillespie demands that the interns diagnose him on the spot, only Kildare takes up his challenge, prognosticating that he has a melanoma on his hand and a year to live. When Kildare hedges before Gillespie&#x27;s gruff, Gillespie dismisses interest in him.

Later, Kildare is assigned ambulance duty with attendant Joe Wayman (Nat Pendleton). His first call is a man who has passed out in a bar. Discarding the obvious conclusion of drunkenness, Kildare suspects the man has a serious medical problem. When Kildare has to respond to a second, more urgent call, he orders the skeptical Wayman to give the man oxygen all the way to the hospital. Wayman disregards his order and the man dies as a result. Kildare later takes the blame rather than have Wayman lose his job.

Kildare then attends to Barbara Chanler (Jo Ann Sayers), a young suicide victim. Despite finding no signs of life, Kildare refuses to give up and finally succeeds in reviving her. Barbara Chanler turns out to be the sole child and heiress of extremely wealthy Robert Chanler (Pierre Watkin). Highly respected psychiatrist Dr. Lane-Porteus (Monty Woolley) diagnoses schizophrenia. Kildare, based on a short conversation he had with Barbara, is sure that she was driven to attempt suicide for more ordinary reasons. However, when Kildare refuses to divulge what she told him in the strictest confidence, Carew suspends him.

From a chance comment by Barbara&#x27;s concerned fiance, Jack Hamilton (Truman Bradley), Kildare is able to piece the clues together. After quarreling with Hamilton, Barbara had gone to a nightclub alone, where she had started drinking heavily. A man took her upstairs to a private room, and that&#x27;s all she remembered of the night. She was found by a policeman wandering the streets and taken home. Fear of what might have happened during her blackout made her try to take her own life.

When Kildare goes to Gillespie for advice, the older man broadly hints that he should ignore hospital rules. Kildare sneaks in to see Barbara to reassure her that nothing disgraceful happened. The man at the nightclub had recognized her and, fearful of what her rich father would do if he took advantage of her condition, he had simply dumped her on the street. Kildare then coaches Barbara on how to act so that Lane-Porteus does not have her confined to a mental institution.

Unaware of these developments, the hospital board fires Kildare for insubordination. He tells his parents and Alice, who have come to see him, that he is ready to become his father&#x27;s partner. However, Gillespie has other ideas. All along, he had been testing Kildare. Now that he is sure of Kildare&#x27;s integrity, competence and most of all courage of convictions, Gillespie hires the young man as his assistant, to pass along as much as possible before he dies of what Kildare had correctly diagnosed.

<doc id="1221319" wikidata="Q2183509" url="?curid=1221319" title="Liza Wang">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Liza&quot; Wang Ming-chun (born 28 August 1947), is a Hong Kong diva, actress and MC. She is a personality in Chinese-speaking communities. She has been nicknamed &quot;The Big Sister&quot; in the Hong Kong entertainment circle. Wang was a delegate in the National People&#x27;s Congress from 1988 to 1997, and she is a member of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

==Entertainment career==
Liza Wang was born on 28 August 1947 in Shanghai, She moved to Hong Kong from Shanghai in autumn 1956 and signed up for Rediffusion Hong Kong&#x27;s first Artist Academy class in 1967. From thousands of applicants, the 20-year-old Liza was one of the nine that were picked to attend acting classes. She was also the first to graduate from the academy.

===Television===
Her career has spanned four decades, since 1967. She began working for Rediffusion Television Limited (later renamed Asia Television and now defunct) until she joined TVB in 1971. She was one of the members of the all-girl music group Four Golden Flowers. Wang initially made her mark in the entertainment industry in drama series. Her work in front of the camera was followed by that behind the scenes on television productions.

In 2005, she received the Best Actress award during TVB&#x27;s 38th Anniversary. She received this award the second time for her role in &quot;Wars of In-laws&quot;. Wang received her first Best Actress award for her drama series &quot;The Awakening Story&quot; in 2001. She celebrated her 40th anniversary in the entertainment industry in 2007.

===Singing career===
In parallel with her acting career Wang had a successful singing career, based on albums for her television series, consisting of TV theme songs. She has sung cantopop as well as mandopop. She performed duets with singer Adam Cheng. She continues to perform TV theme songs such as &quot;東方之珠&quot; for musical series like the 2006 Glittering Days.

===Cantonese opera===

She experimented with stage musicals before becoming a Cantonese opera actress. It was within the Cantonese opera community that Wang met her longtime partner, Law Kar-ying. In 2005 the Sunbeam Theatre in North Point, Hong Kong&#x27;s only regular venue for Cantonese Opera performances, was planned to close following a change of ownership. Wang decided to negotiate with the new owner, who then promised to extend the contract with the Cantonese Opera groups. Wang then criticized the Government for its lack of support for Cantonese Opera, and the Government promised to adopt Wang&#x27;s request.

Wang was Chairman of the Chinese Artist Association of Hong Kong (香港八和會館) from 1992 to 1997, then again from 2005 to 2009. In 2007 Wang was awarded the Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award. She was later awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the City University of Hong Kong.

In February 2009 Wang fought for the development rights to restore the North Kowloon Magistracy building (北九龍裁判法院) in Sham Shui Po. The building was originally proposed to be a new Cantonese opera training and performance center. Hong Kong&#x27;s government granted the bid to the US Savannah College of Art and Design. Wang was upset over the loss, and said the government was only paying lip service to causes such as Cantonese opera. The magistracy building is to be turned into a school specializing in creative and digital media.

==Political career==

===Pan-democrat home return permits request===
Since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party have banned 8 of the 25 Hong Kong pan-democrat legislative councilors. They are barred from the mainland except for tours organized by the government. On 6 March 2008 Wang began publicizing the need to grant 24 Home Return Permit to the pro-democracy lawmakers.

===Government Committee===
On Apr 29, 2020, The Hong Kong SAR announced the appointments to the Cantonese Opera Advisory Committee which aims to promote the development of Cantonese opera, facilitating the transmission of this world intangible cultural heritage item, for the period from May 1, 2020, to April 30, 2022. Wang is one of the members.

==2008 Beijing Olympics==
Wang mentioned that it was good timing to invite the democrats to enter mainland China in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The Pro-Beijing party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong member Tam Yiu Chung responded that the Olympics was not a good reason for changing what the central government used to do. Her concerns baffled her colleagues in the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference. Democrat member Albert Ho said the issue of a home visit permit was such a rightful thing. It has never been mentioned by any politician but a performer. He appreciates Wang&#x27;s efforts. Wang is a member, but not a standing committee member of the CPPCC.

==Community work==
As a mainstay at the TVB television network, Wang has gained almost legendary status for her efforts not merely as an entertainer but also as a philanthropist with a heart for social works and for improving lives in rural China and other areas. Within Hong Kong, she has also been an MC hosting TVB telethons for Tung Wah Group of Hospitals and many other charities.

Wang, being a two-time cancer survivor (first thyroid then breast cancer), decided to be an executive committee member of the Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society. A series of informative radio talk shows on RTHK was also hosted where medical specialists were invited to discuss the many types of cancer. She has helped raise charities, awareness and funding for cancer patients. Recently a free concert was given at Tin Shui Wai for 4,500 residents; the concert was filled to capacity and hundreds were turned away. The crowd prevented guest performers like Miriam Yeung and Denise Ho from arriving on time. Denise Ho ascribed the audience overflow to Wang&#x27;s popularity.

==Personal life==
Liza Wang was married to businessman Lau Cheong Wah from 1971 to 1983 and they remain good friends. In the late 1980s, she met Law Kar-ying, openly acknowledged as her partner for over twenty years, and whom she married on 2 May 2009 in Las Vegas. Being a native Shanghainese, Wang speaks fluent Shanghainese and has always identified as a Shanghainese.

===The nickname of &quot;Wang Ah-Tag&quot; owing to social media usage===
In recent years, Liza Wang has increased her usage in social media. However, upon uploading the photos with others, she has been handwriting the names of others on the photos. These handwritings have been occasionally described as &quot;Wang Ah-Tag&quot;.

<doc id="1221326" wikidata="Q7967891" url="?curid=1221326" title="Wilson River language">
<text>The Wilson River language, also known as &quot;Modern&quot; Wankumara (Wangkumara/ Wanggumara), is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Karnic family. It was spoken by several peoples along the Wilson River in Queensland. Of these, the Wanggumara (Wangkumara) and Galali may have migrated from the Bulloo River and abandoned their language when they arrived.

==Speakers==

In 1981, the language was still spoken by four members of the Wangkumara community around Cooper Creek, the Thomson River, and the Warry Warry Creek, the town of Eromanga and the Nuccundra. It appears to have gone extinct by 2005.

==Varieties==
Dixon (2002) considers Punthamara to be a dialect of Wangkumara, Bowern (2001) as very close. Bowern says that Ngandangara also appears to have been &quot;very close&quot;, although data is too poor for a proper classification. Karenggapa is either a dialect or an alternative name. (McDonald &amp; Wurm 1979) note that Wilson River Galali, what they call &quot;Waŋkumara (Gaḷali)&quot;, is very close to modern Waŋkumara and Bundamara.

Breen (1967) states that the (Karnic) speech of the groups along the Wilson River are essentially identical. These include Bundhamara, Gungadudji, &#x27;Modern&#x27; Wanggumara and Ngandangura. For instance, that Gungadidji is &#x27;almost identical to Punthamara and modern Wangkumara&#x27;. Nonetheless, these language varieties have been assigned individual ISO codes.

Mambangura (the language of the Thereila) may have belonged as well. At least, the Yandruwandha term &quot;Palpakunu&quot; covered it as well as the other Wilson River dialects.

A language labelled &quot;Wonkomarra&quot; in Myles (1886) is a different language from modern Wangkumara, and may be a variety of Kalali.

==Features==
Wangkumara is notable for being a language with a tripartite verbal alignment. Wurm&#x27;s &quot;Wankamara (Galali)&quot; is entirely suffixing and morphologically fairly simple having the following word classes: nominal (noun and pronoun), verb, particle, and interjection. The word order is random and free. The phonemes consist of three vowels and 26 consonants.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
* /d̪/ can have an allophone of [ð] when after /l̪/.
* Sounds /b, ɟ, ɡ/ can be lenited as fricatives [β, ʒ, ɣ] when in intervocalic positions or after lateral sounds.

=== Vowels ===

The vowel sounds are a three-vowel system. Vowel length is not evenly distributed, but is mostly heard phonetically when preceding voiced consonants. Allophones may also occur.

<text>The Aero Commander 100, various models of which were known as the Darter Commander and Lark Commander, is an American light aircraft produced in the 1960s. It was a high-wing monoplane of conventional design, equipped with fixed tricycle undercarriage.

==Design and development==
The aircraft was originally designed by Volaircraft, first flying in 1960. The firm marketed the original three-seat version as the Volaire 1035 and a four-seat version with a more powerful engine as the Volaire 1050 before North American Rockwell purchased all rights to the design on July 12, 1965, for production by its Aero Commander division. Production of the Darter Commander version continued until 1969 and of the revised Lark Commander until 1971 (by which time, Rockwell had dropped the Aero Commander brand name).

A Volaire 1050 was exhibited at the 1966 Hanover Air Show and later sold to Finland. Other examples of the type were exported to Australia and Canada.

Finding the light aircraft market too competitive for its liking, Rockwell ceased production of the Lark Commander in 1971 and sold the rights to all versions of the aircraft to Phoenix Aircraft of Euclid, Ohio, but this company never actually put it into production.

==Variants==

===Volaircraft===
* Model 10 – prototypes
* Volaire 1035 – three-seat production version powered by Lycoming O-290
* Volaire 1050 – four-seat production version powered by Lycoming O-320

===Aero Commander/Rockwell===
* Aero Commander 100 – alias Volaire 1050
** Aero Commander 100A – alias Volaire 1035
** Darter Commander – 100 with revised windows and other minor modifications
* Lark Commander 180 – revised aerodynamics, with swept fin and rudder and Lycoming O-360-A2F engine. Production from 1968.

<text>The Meyers 200 is a single-engined light aircraft produced in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Design==
It was the brainchild of Al Meyers and was a development of his Meyers MAC-145 design. The holder of a number of speed records in its class, the Meyers 200 is widely admired for its clean lines, and is also known for its exceptionally sturdy airframe. This strength is derived from a tubular 4130 chrome-moly steel truss structure with aluminum skin that protects occupants.

===Acquisition by Aero Commander===
In 1966, the Aero Commander division of North American Rockwell purchased the rights to the Meyers 145 and 200, as part of a strategy to capture a share of the light aircraft market in the United States. During this time it was in the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. Known briefly as the Aero Commander 200, it soon emerged that the firm could not produce the design economically. Meyers&#x27; firm had been virtually hand-building each aircraft and no jigs or tooling for the kind of mass production envisaged by Aero Commander even existed at the time the rights were bought. Having spent US$4 million to produce just US$3 million worth of product, Aero Commander ceased production in 1968 and sold the rights to the Interceptor Corporation, which developed a turboprop-powered version as the Interceptor 400. Ownership of the rights eventually passed to Prop-Jets, Inc., later known as Interceptor Aircraft Corporation. In 2014 the Global Parts Group, via a separately formed affiliate company called Interceptor Aviation Inc, purchased the rights along with all associated assets and intellectual property related to the Meyers 200 and Interceptor 400 model aircraft.

==Operational service==
The Meyers 200D has never had an in-flight structural failure and has never had a Federal Aviation Administration mandated Airworthiness Directive (AD) issued against the airframe. The 4130 chrome-moly steel tubular roll cage and understructure act like a race car protective cage during a crash. Several Meyers aircraft have been forced down in the trees and off airport runways with documented instances of the occupants walking away with only minor injuries or a broken bone.

==Variants==

<text>The Interceptor 400 was a turboprop-powered single-engined light aircraft developed from the Meyers 200 single-engine piston plane. It attracted buyers but was unable to obtain adequate manufacturing financing, and was perhaps too far ahead of its time. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, at the time of its development, the market for single-engined turboprops was still a decade away.

==Design and development==
Development of the aircraft commenced when Lymon Lyon approached Aero Commander to build him a one-off modification of the 200, to be powered by a turboprop. His request came just as Aero Commander was realizing that the 200 piston engine aircraft was not economically viable in volumes they sought, and instead, offered to sell Lyon the 200 type certificate and work that Aero Commander had begun on a turbine engine conversion model 400 instead. Lyon and a group of investors assembled by entrepreneur and merger and acquisition expert Thomas W Itin, then formed the Interceptor Corporation to develop and market the 400 turbine engine version, the Interceptor 400 aircraft.

The plant was moved from the Aero Commander site in Albany, Georgia, to Norman, Oklahoma, where the engineering was completed for the Interceptor 400 type certificate

Its first flight was on June 27, 1969, and certification was obtained in 1971. However, without adequately funded buyers, major Interceptor investor Paul Luce eventually took possession of the company&#x27;s intellectual property and the prototype Interceptor 400 when the firm could not repay capital he had loaned it. The rights were then owned by Prop-Jets Inc, in which Luce maintained a 50% stake. Later Prop-Jets changed its name to Interceptor Aircraft Company, with Mr. Luce no longer being involved. There is one Interceptor 400 plane still registered and still flying.

A militarized version, the Interceptor I400-M reached at least the planning stage. It was envisaged for a wide variety of roles, including training, reconnaissance, Forward Air Control, and Counterinsurgency, as well as general utility duties.

On May 22, 2014, Global Parts Group, of Augusta, Kansas, announced they had acquired the type certificate of the Interceptor 400 and the Meyers 200 aircraft models. The Global Parts Group formed a separate affiliate company, Interceptor Aviation Inc., for the ownership of the type certificate, along with all assets and intellectual property related to both the Interceptor 400 and Meyers 200 type designs. The aircraft design and tooling were discovered in storage in a barn on a farm in Wichita, Kansas.

<doc id="1221343" wikidata="Q1552888" url="?curid=1221343" title="Fritillaria affinis">
<text>Fritillaria affinis, the chocolate lily, is a highly variable species of flowering plant in the lily family Liliaceae native to western North America.

== Description ==
It grows from a bulb, which resembles a small mass of rice grains. The stems are tall. The flowers are produced in the spring, nodding, , yellowish or greenish brown with a lot of yellow mottling to purplish black with little mottling, or yellow-green mottled with purple. The leaves are in whorls.

There are two varieties:
*Fritillaria affinis&quot; var. &quot;affinis: This is the more common and widespread variant, occurring throughout the plant&#x27;s range. It can be differentiated by its strong mottling pattern. Its bulb has 2 to 20 small scales.
*Fritillaria affinis&quot; var. &quot;tristulis: This variant is much less widespread; it is found only in Marin County on the north coast of California. It has a much more subtle mottling pattern and is generally darker overall. Its bulb has 60 to 100 small scales.

==Distribution and habitat==
It can be found in California, Klamath Ranges, the north coast ranges, Cascade Ranges, north Sierra Nevada foothills, and the San Francisco Bay Area, north to British Columbia, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho.

Its habitat includes oak or pine scrub or open woods and thickets near the coast. It prefers low to mid-elevation, shade or part shade, dry summer dormancy, and good drainage.

==Uses==
The roots or bulbs can be eaten raw or cooked. Historically, the bulbs of this plant were eaten steamed by Salish Native American peoples, including the Squamish, Sechelt, Halq&#x27;emeylem and Straits Salish.

<doc id="1221348" wikidata="Q891832" url="?curid=1221348" title="Bombay Hills">
<text>The Bombay Hills are a range of hills to the south of Auckland, New Zealand. Though only a small and seemingly insignificant range of hills, they lie at the southern boundary of the Auckland region, and serve as a divide between Auckland and the Waikato region. There is a 19th-century settlement, Bombay, on the old main road south of Auckland, the Great South Road.

Aucklanders and other New Zealanders have a mostly light-hearted &quot;love-hate&quot; relationship. Stereotypically, Aucklanders view parts of the country &quot;south of the Bombay Hills&quot; as provincial and unsophisticated, while the rest of the country sees Aucklanders as brash and arrogant. For this reason, the boundary between Auckland and its southern neighbours bears great significance. People on both sides of the boundary are as likely to use the phrase &quot;New Zealand stops at the Bombay Hills&quot;. The term was adopted by 1990s New Zealand reggae band Southside of Bombay.

==Location==
The hills are located southeast of Auckland, close to the town of Pukekohe. State Highway 1 here reaches its highest point between Auckland and Tīrau in the eastern Waikato Region, to the southeast. Bombay is the nearest settlement to the southern fringe of the Auckland metropolitan area.

==Name==
The settlement of Bombay and hence the Bombay Hills are directly named after the ship &quot;Bombay&quot;, which landed in Auckland and brought settlers to the area, originally called Williamson&#x27;s Clearing, in 1865. The ship itself was named after the Indian city of Bombay (now Mumbai).

==Geology==
The Bombay Hills are a remnant of a shield volcano from the South Auckland volcanic field, which erupted an estimated 600,000 years ago. The hills are overlain by Hamilton Ash tephra which has weathered to create some of the best soils for market gardening in New Zealand.

The Bombay Hills are the barrier that halts the northward progression of the Waikato River. The hills cause it to turn west towards the coast where it empties into the Tasman Sea near Port Waikato.

==Demographics==
Bombay Hills statistical area covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Bombay Hills had a population of 1,989 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 123 people (6.6%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 480 people (31.8%) since the 2013 census. There were 987 males, 999 females and 3 people of other genders in 669 dwellings. 2.0% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 45.1 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 357 people (17.9%) aged under 15 years, 303 (15.2%) aged 15 to 29, 960 (48.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 366 (18.4%) aged 65 or older.

English was spoken by 95.8%, Māori language by 1.4%, Samoan by 0.3%, and other languages by 13.6%. No language could be spoken by 1.8% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.3%. The percentage of people born overseas was 22.5, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 31.5% Christian, 2.7% Hindu, 1.8% Islam, 0.3% Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% Buddhist, 0.6% New Age, 0.2% Jewish, and 2.6% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 52.0%, and 8.0% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 354 (21.7%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 930 (57.0%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 351 (21.5%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $49,800, compared with $41,500 nationally. 318 people (19.5%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 903 (55.3%) people were employed full-time, 243 (14.9%) were part-time, and 24 (1.5%) were unemployed.

==Residents==
The Bombay Hills has many former athletes as residents including Eric Murray (Olympic rower), Katherine Prumm (World Champion motorcyclist) and Andy Dalton (former All Black captain). Bombay is also the location of a monastery of enclosed Benedictine nuns, Tyburn Monastery.
== Walkways ==
Since the closure of Te Araroa long-distance walkway through the Hunua Ranges in 2018, it has followed Pinnacle Hill Road for through the Bombay Hills.

The Mount William Walkway runs parallel to Te Araroa, linking Puketutu and Mount William. It goes through bush with kauri, hard beech and king ferns and has views to Waikato, the west coast and Firth of Thames.

<doc id="1221356" wikidata="Q5435793" url="?curid=1221356" title="Farmers Market (Los Angeles)">
<text>The Original Farmers Market is an area of food stalls, sit-down eateries, prepared food vendors, and produce markets in Los Angeles, California, at the corner of Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street. First opened in July 1934, it is also a historic Los Angeles landmark and tourist attraction.

The Original Farmers Market features more than 100 vendors, including ready-to-eat foods, grocers, and tourist shops, and is located just south of Television City. Unlike most farmers&#x27; markets, which are held only at intervals, The Original Farmers&#x27; Market of Los Angeles is a permanent installation and is open seven days a week. The vendors serve many kinds of food, both American cuisine from local farmers and local ethnic foods from the many immigrant communities of Los Angeles, with many Latin American and Asian cuisines well represented.

It is located at the corner of 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles. It is adjacent to The Grove outdoor shopping mall; an electric-powered streetcar runs between the two sites.

The market is a destination for foodies in search of the market&#x27;s ethnic cuisines, specialty food markets, and prepared-food stalls. A sign that reads &quot;Meet Me at Third and Fairfax&quot; displays at the front of The Original Farmers Market.
== History ==
The origins of the market started in 1880, when Arthur Fremont Gilmore and his partner, who had come from Illinois, bought two dairy farms in the Los Angeles area. Gilmore bought what is now called The Original Farmers Market, and his partner bought the land plot nowadays known as The Grove. Ten years later the partners decided to split their holdings and Gilmore took control of the large 256-acre ranch, its dairy herd, and farmhands at what is now the world-famous Original Farmers Market and Grove. The market started when a dozen nearby farmers began to park their trucks on a field to sell fresh produce to local residents. The cost to rent the space was fifty cents per day.

Gilmore Oil Company replaced the dairy farm when oil was discovered under the land while drilling for water wells in 1905; this became the Salt Lake Oil Field. Earl Bell (E. B.) Gilmore, son of A. F. Gilmore, took over the family business. The younger Gilmore started midget car racing and brought professional football to Los Angeles. He built Gilmore Field for the Hollywood Stars baseball team, which was owned by Bing Crosby, Barbara Stanwyck, and Cecil B. DeMille.

When Television City opened next door in 1952, The Original Farmers Market provided those working or visiting that television studio a convenient place to shop or eat.

In the 1970s The Country Kitchen, a restaurant owned and operated by Jack and Eileen Smith (located next to the still-operating Du-par&#x27;s), was popular with stars and their fans alike. Mickey Rooney could sometimes be found working behind the counter.
In 2014 The Farmers Market opened Farmers Market in LAX Terminal 5 in collaboration with Delaware North Companies. The location at the airport marks the first time in the history of the iconic Original Farmers Market that the Los Angeles landmark has expanded beyond Third &amp; Fairfax. The licensed location features a broad selection of meals, snacks, wine, coffee and sweets from Original Farmers Market restaurants and stalls, so that visitors from across the world can experience a taste of the legendary Farmers Market inside Terminal 5.

==In popular culture==
The 1971 Beach Boys song &quot;H.E.L.P. Is On the Way&quot; indirectly refers to The Original Farmers Market in its lyrics:

&quot;&quot;We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd &lt;br&gt;
&quot;(Fairfax and 3rd)&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;We&#x27;re gonna spread the news and give you the word&quot;.&quot;

The song served to promote songwriter Brian Wilson&#x27;s own health food store, Radiant Radish.

<doc id="1221357" wikidata="Q3073214" url="?curid=1221357" title="Flag House &amp; Star-Spangled Banner Museum">
<text>The Star-Spangled Banner Flag House, formerly the Flag House &amp; Star-Spangled Banner Museum, is a museum located in the Jonestown/Old Town and adjacent to Little Italy neighborhoods of eastern downtown Baltimore, Maryland, United States.

Built in 1793, it was the home of Mary Young Pickersgill when she moved to Baltimore in 1806 and the location where she later sewed the &quot;Star Spangled Banner,&quot; in 1813, the huge out-sized garrison flag that flew over Fort McHenry at Whetstone Point in Baltimore Harbor in the summer of 1814 during the British Royal Navy attack in the Battle of Baltimore during the War of 1812. The museum contains furniture and antiques from the Federal period as well as items from the Pickersgill family.

A supplemental museum was constructed to the rear next to Pickersgill&#x27;s home. This museum houses exhibits on the War of 1812 and the Battle of Baltimore. It has an orientation theater, gift shop, exhibit galleries, and meeting rooms. The museum features a 30 by tall window which was created to be the same color, size, and design of the original &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; flag of 15 stars and 15 stripes made by Pickersgill in the adjacent Flag House and completed on the floor of a nearby brewery by members of her family and servants/slaves. Set into the ground outside the museum is a map of the United States, with each state formed from a piece of stone quarried within its borders.

==Post Pickersgill==
In 1927 the house was sold to the City of Baltimore and the newly established Star-Spangled Banner Flag House Association which grew out of a number of members who had participated in the earlier Centennial Celebration in 1914. In the twenty years prior to that, the home had been used for a variety of services including: a post office, bank and shipping facility. Prior to 1908 the house was occupied by Placido Milio and his family. In 1928 it was dubbed a historic shrine.

==Restoration==

Additional restoration and expansion efforts were initiated in 1952 by Mayor Thomas J. D’Alesandro, Jr., twenty-five years after the initial establishment in 1927-1928 of a historical museum in the Flag House. The expansion included a smaller brick building to the rear/north for a museum with exhibits area and office space. Mayor D&#x27;Alesandro was especially interested and concerned since he had lived all his life just a few blocks away to the southeast in the neighborhood of &quot;Little Italy&quot;. The hope was to complete the home to a full restoration including replica furnishings from the time period. Although some of the money used to fuel this project came from emergency funds for the year, donations were also accepted. Most notably, the Daughters of the American Revolution provided a significant donation. The Flag House Association worked to organize this program. An early proposal for saving the deteriorating building included a 1946 plan to physically move the Flag House to a resting place in Fort McHenry, however those efforts failed. Despite the redevelopment of this historic landmark, modernization of the area surrounding the home caused controversy. Many claimed that the proposed east–west route of the cross-city Interstate 95 with an interchange connection to the southern end of the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83), running through the historical neighborhoods of Federal Hill and Fells Point on either side of the harbor waterfront, would ruin the natural antique environment of the historic site home.

The house was already designated a National Historic Landmark under the Historic Sites Act of 1935 program of the U. S. Department of the Interior&#x27;s National Park Service in 1969.

==Activism==
At various times in its history, the Flag House has served as the backdrop for patriotic activism.

At a Flag House ceremony in June 1955 celebrating the opening of National Flag Week, retired Brigadier General Bonner Fellers in a speech advocated for &quot;an overwhelming air force, without conscription&quot; and an end to diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union. He also warned against ceding American sovereignty through a status of forces treaty and strongly urged in favor of the adaptation of the Bricker Amendment.

In June 1961, during a dedication ceremony for the stone map, Representative Gordon L. McDonough (R., CA) stood before a crowd of 375 people and advocated for a return &quot;to good old-fashioned American patriotism&quot; and for adopting Flag Day as a national holiday.

In May 1980, the Flag House held a press conference where they launched a nationwide drive to encourage all Americans to &quot;Pause for the Pledge&quot; on Flag Day, which in June 1985, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in Public Law 99–54, recognizing the pause for the Pledge of Allegiance as part of National Flag Day activities.

<doc id="1221360" wikidata="Q1280895" url="?curid=1221360" title="Club Necaxa">
<text>Impulsora del Deportivo Necaxa S.A. de C.V. (); often simply known as Club Necaxa, is a Mexican professional football club based in Aguascalientes. It competes in Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football. It was founded on August 21, 1923 in Mexico City by the Scottish-born engineer William H. Frasser. In 2003, it changed its headquarters to the city of Aguascalientes, in the state of the same name. The team plays its home games at Estadio Victoria.

The club has 12 titles in its record (three in the League, four in the Mexico Cup, two in the Champion of Champions, one in the Mexican Super Cup, one in the CONCACAF Champions Cup and one in the CONCACAF Cup Winners Cup), as well as well as four Promotion League titles and two as winners of the promotion series. It was the first team to win the double in Mexico, winning the League and the Cup in the same season, this in 1932-33, thus taking the nickname Campeonísimo, becoming the first team in Mexican soccer to carry that nickname.

At the international level and beyond its confederation titles, the club&#x27;s most notable performance was obtaining third place in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship held in Brazil. 

It occupies 7th place in the list of the International Federation of Football History and Statistics of the Club of the Century of North and Central America (1901-2000), being the best-placed Mexican club.

==History==

===Foundation (Light and Power Company, &quot;Luz y Fuerza&quot;) (1899–1920)===
Necaxa was founded on 21 August 1923 by Scotsman William H. Fraser, an engineer and owner of the Light and Power Company (&quot;Compañía de Luz y Fuerza&quot;) in the state of Puebla. As a student in Scotland Fraser played football and was a strong advocate for the sport. Fraser consolidated the teams of the Light and Power Company and the Street Car operators &quot;Compañia de Luz y Fuerza and Tranvías&quot; into one.

Fraser supported the newly merged team with company revenue and funds. In addition, the Light and Power Company offered steady employment to players in an era where half of the players were playing at an amateur level. However, the Mexican football federation did not allow teams to be named after private companies, so the team changed its name to Necaxa, after the Necaxa River that was close to the electrical plant.

Historians assert that the colors and Necaxa&#x27;s crest came from following the arrival of the Cornish community in Mexico, the Cornish community flourished and stayed in Central Mexico until the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Although the Cornish community in Mexico broadly returned to Cornwall, they left a cultural legacy; Cornish pasties, Cornish mining museums, a Cornish Mexican Cultural Society and football, are part of the local heritage and tradition in and around Mineral del Monte.
In 1923, it was decided Necaxa team would field players regardless of race and nationality.

In that era, the team was called &quot;Los Electricistas&quot; (&quot;The Electricians&quot;). The team adopted the colors red and white as their team colors, earning them the nickname &quot;Los roji-blancos&quot;. During this period, the oldest rivalry in Mexican football began to form, between Necaxa and Atlante F.C.

On 14 September 1930, having already been a 2-time champion of the amateur Copa Eliminatoria, Necaxa inaugurated its stadium named Parque Necaxa, located on the banks of La Piedad River on land donated by the Fraser Family. The stadium had a maximum capacity for 15,000 fans, and was known for its clock tower displaying the team&#x27;s emblem.

Necaxa, in the early days of Mexican Football were members of the Mexican Amateur Association Football League Liga Mexicana de Fútbol Amateur Association, composed of Atlante F.C., Club España, Germania FV, and seasoned and disciplined team Asturias. Necaxa won championships during the 1932–33, 1934–35, 1936–37, 1937–38 seasons.

The following season after the stadium&#x27;s opening, players such as Hilario López and Luis Pérez contributed to the team&#x27;s success, leading Necaxa to the League final against Atlante, losing 3–2.

But Necaxa would rebound the next season, smashing Atlante by a 9–0 score. The line-up Necaxa used on that day was the following: 
During this decade, Necaxa became one of the most popular teams in Mexico. Under the direction of the Ernst Pauler, Necaxa, in one season of play (1935–36), the team dominated and won titles ranging from Champion of Champions, Champion of the Liga Mayor De La Ciudad, National Champion of League, National Champion and Central American Champions. Their last title was the Central American Championship in El Salvador.

Mexico
&quot;Paco&quot; Martinez de la Vega, an aficionado, would coin the surname for the first time &quot;Campeonismo&quot; or &quot;Championshipism&quot;, which Necaxa would later use to justify their achievements and titles.

===Late 1930s: Once Hermanos===
Following the Mexican Revolution, the late 1930s represented Necaxa&#x27;s most successful all-Mexican team. The Once Hermanos or &quot;Eleven Brothers&quot; period was coined in that era due to that team&#x27;s ability to work as a team. The Necaxa team, in 1936, won the Copa México.

In that same year, a talented striker gained popularity within Necaxa&#x27;s benches. Even though he was not one of the original &quot;once hermano&quot; or &quot;eleventh brother&quot; Horacio Casarìn, was a great player in the Mexican league national ranks. His success took him to the big screen in Mexican Cinema.

===1940s brief hiatus===
Necaxa disappears from competitive play within the Mexican League in 1943 altogether due to the professionalization of Mexican Football. It would be half a decade before the Necaxa emblem and uniform would be represented on the field again.

===1950-60s resurgence===
Seven years later, Club Necaxa returned to play under the conditions of the commercialization of the Mexican league. Under the new ownership of the Union of Electricians and Juan Jose Rivas Rojas, Club Necaxa played their first game on 25 September 1950 in the old district of Oblatos, in a stadium called Parque Oblatos or &quot;Oblatos Stadium&quot; otherwise called the Municipal Stadium of Felipe Martinez Sandoval in Guadalajara, Mexico. This park inaugurated Necaxa&#x27;s comeback to football. In the fifties, Necaxa were tenants and played in the Federal District of Mexico City in present-day Estadio Azul (1950–55).

In the late sixties, Necaxa played football in Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. A modern lighting system in Estadio Azteca was inaugurated on 5 June 1966 with the first night game between Valencia CF and Necaxa. The first goal of the game was scored by Honduran José Cardona. In this game Roberto Martínez o Caña Brava scored the first goal made by a Mexican. Estadio Azteca was the largest stadium in Latin America, and the fifth largest stadium in the world. It is known throughout North America and South America as the home stadium for the Mexico national football team.

Throughout the 1950s Necaxa struggled financially to keep afloat. In 1955, large debts obliged Necaxa to sell the majority of its star players. Miguel Ramierz Vazquez a new owner, contracted the services of the Uruguayan coach Donald Ross, who eventually took Guadalajara to a championship 1957, beginning a road to stability, yet not winning championships.

The electricians won the Title cup in 1960 and the following year, in the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico Olympic stadium, &quot;the electricians&quot; defeated Rey Pele and the club and team of the Santos of Brazil 4–3 in an official match of that year&#x27;s &quot;Exagonal&quot; tournament. &quot;Morocho&quot; Dante Juarez assisted in two victorious goals in Necaxa&#x27;s win over the Santos de Brazil.

Through the early 1960s, Necaxa struggled financially until it was sold. New owners, Julio Orvañanos, brought a championship in 1965–66.

===Mexico 68 and Carlos Albert vs Necaxa===
In this decade, the organization was in financial trouble. The team had poor attendance in Mexico City due to the population unrest.

The case of Carlos Albert begins with a small group of veteran footballers in the spring of 1969. Club Necaxa Veteran players petitioned the organization for better wages and argued that as a team and group, they have always responded to the team&#x27;s performance. Carlos Albert was the face of the disagreement between the players and management.

Albert was listed by Necaxa Management as transferable and was retained on half his salary. He asked management to void his contract in order, to avoid loss of income and to be able to continue playing in the League with another team. Necaxa Management did not accept his request.

The courts ruled in favour of Albert on Thursday 8 October 1971, and Necaxa was forced to pay MX$77,000 to Carlos Albert. Due to the will of managements unfair psychological abuse and labour malpractice, This case forced a cause to action from several players to request better treatment and more rights for Necaxa football players.

===Atlético Español 1971 to 1982===
On 19 September 1971, Club Necaxa experienced financial trouble and became in debt with players and management. The owners sold the club to a group of businessmen from Spain. The ownership handled the player contracts, disputes and the franchises debt. The new Spanish ownership restructured contracts and made Club Necaxa solvent. The club played under the name of the Spanish Athletic Bulls or &quot;Toros del Atlético Español&quot;.

In 1975, the organization won their only international title in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, playing the final against Transvaal of Suriname and defeating them 5–1 on aggregate. In 1973–74, they reached the final against Cruz Azul. They played a two-legged tie in which the Atlético Español won the first leg 2–1 but lost the second 3–0, becoming sub champion of the league.

Players who distinguished themselves in Atlético Español were the Brazilian striker Carlos Eloir Perucci, Ricardo Brandón, Salvador Plascencia,&#x27;Sabanita&#x27; Rivera, Juan Santillán, and Tomás Boy, under the direction of Miguel Marín, &#x27;the Witch&#x27; Gutiérrez,
Enrique Díaz and &#x27;Chucho&#x27; Prado and the Chiliean Prieto.

In 1982, the Spanish ownership within the Federal District of Mexico city sold the franchise. A new group of Mexican businessmen purchased Necaxa in 1982, then telecommunications Giant Grupo Televisa returned the organization&#x27;s original name from 1971 and opened its training facilities in Cuautitlán Izcalli in the state of Mexico. The ownership renamed the franchise Necaxa by 1982 after the cultural and historical importance of the franchise in Mexican football. While Mexico experienced a crisis called &quot;the Lost Decade&quot; or &quot;La Decada Perdida&quot; in the 1980s and early 1970s, Necaxa in the 1980s struggled against two relegation matches. One at the end of the 1982–83 season against Zacatepec and another by the end of the 1984–85 season against Leones Universidad de Guadalajara.

Atlético Español footballers:
Goalkeepers: Julito Aguilar, Jan Gomola, Goyo Cortez, Enrique Vazquez del Mercado, Defense: El Pimienta Rico, Juan Manuel Alvarez, Mario Trejo, Midfielder: Juan Carlos Rodriguez Vega, Manuel Manzo, Benito Buen Hombre Pardo, Tomas Boy. Forwards: Juan Manuel Borbolla, J.J. Muñante, Romano, Carlos Eloir Perucci, El Cachito Ramirez, Ricardo Brandon, Pio Tabaré Gonzalez, Juan Carlos Rossete. Raúl &#x27;El Cora Isiordia&quot;, y Alejandro Romanh.

===New Owners and return to glory (1990–2000)===
In 1988, Futbol Club Necaxa was purchased by Mexican telecommunications giant Grupo Televisa S.A C.V. The now late owner, Emilio Azcárraga Milmo (father of Emilio Azcárraga Jean), and several associates took a new direction with the team.

In the 1989 and 1990 season, director of football operations Anibal Ruiz acquired the services of the Ecuadorian midfielder, Álex Aguinaga, one of the iconic figures of the Necaxa in the 1990s and one of the most talented foreign players who has ever set foot on Mexican soil.

Necaxa has a great season, previously in the 1980s they battled twice against México Primera División&#x27;s regulations of the Mexican League. In that year Necaxa reached the finals losing to Pumas of the University of Mexico. The following season Aníbal Ruiz was replaced with new coach, the Argentine ex-defender, Eduardo Luján Manera who contracted the services of the Chilean Ivo Basay. Under Manera, Necaxa didn&#x27;t qualify for the finals of the championship. The acquisition of new coach Roberto Saporiti, marked the beginning of a commitment to competition excellence in a period known to Necaxa fans as &quot;La Epoca Necaxista bajo el Capitalismo&quot; or &quot;the new era of Necaxa under Capitalism&quot;.

In 1992, the talented footballer of UNAM, ex-Puma player Enrique Borja was put under contract and headed the club&#x27;s football operations, leaving Saporiti as head coach of Necaxa. Eventually Saporitti was replaced. The team Saporitti, Manera, Ruiz leave was an offensive minded team, that was disciplined, yet lacked great defensive talent. The following season management engaged the services of Manuel Lapuente. Sergio &quot;El Ratón&quot; Zarate, Octavio &quot;Picas&quot; Becerril, the Chilean Eduardo &quot;Lalo&quot; Vilches, José María &quot;El Chema&quot; Higareda were key figures in the defense and offense of the club. Manuel Lapuente managed Club Necaxa to three Championship titles in Mexico&#x27;s National Football League.

After 56 years, once again Necaxa found itself with the title of &quot;Campeonísimo&quot;, contributing talent in the 1990s and late in the millennium, within the Primera División of the Mexican League and in the Mexico national team.

They won the Mexican League Championship in 1994 (beating Cruz Azul), in 1995 (beating Celaya) and 1998 (beating Guadalajara), becoming Champion of CONCACAF,created a huge upset against European Giants Real Madrid CF in 3rd place match of the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup the following season. Champion of champions the legacy of the &quot;Once Hermanos&quot; attempted to be reestablished within the franchise&#x27;s values and mind set. The Necaxa team of the 1990s had represented the cohesion and ability of working and playing as a team under lucrative financial incentives, forced great communication on the field and execution on the field during advanced Capitalism competition play. Necaxa&#x27;s Championships were similar, yet different reminder of the spirit of &quot;Los Once Hermanos&quot; or &quot;the Eleven Brothers&quot; in the late 1930s.

===Relocation and new home (2000–2009)===
After poor attendance numbers during the early 2000s, Necaxa needed to refresh their home and relocate to improve on this issue. Many considered Estadio Victoria in Aguascalientes to be the first modern stadium built in Mexico.

Attendance continued to decline steadily despite the change of city and stadium for Necaxa. This consistent decline would lead to a relegation for Necaxa during the Spring 2009 campaign.

The Hidrorayos would bounce back winning the fall 2009 and Spring 2010 (undefeated) Ascenso MX titles thus earning an automatic promotion back up to the Liga MX.

===Necaxa in Primera División and return to Ascenso MX (2011–present)===
After winning the 2009–10 promotion, Necaxa returned to the FMF Primera División for the 2010–11 campaign. Omar Arellano began the season with Daniel Brailovsky taking over for the remainder of the tenure. Ultimately the club faced immediate relegation after only one year.

Despite having a good performance in the 2nd division, Necaxa was initially unable to return to the top flight, losing two finals in 2013 against Neza FC and Universidad de Guadalajara.

On 6 December 2014, Necaxa won the Apertura 2014 championship in the final game against Coras de Tepic ultimately losing the promotion play-off against Dorados de Sinaloa.

The Apertura 2015 tournament was not good for Necaxa, finishing in 10th place. However, in Clausura 2016, Necaxa finished the regular season as runner-up, one point behind U. de G. In the playoffs, Necaxa beat Correcaminos 2–1 in the Quarterfinals, Atlante 5–3 in the Semifinals, and Zacatecas 2–0 in the Finals to become champion. Next was a two-legged playoff series against Cd. Juarez, the Apertura 2015 champion. Necaxa won the first leg in Aguascalientes 1–0, and one week later in Cd. Juarez 2–0, thus clinching its return to Primera Division Liga MX for the first time in five years.

===NX Football USA, LLC (2021–present)===
Necaxa took in a 50% ownership partner named NX Football USA, LLC in 2021. The ownership group included former owners from Major League Soccer club D.C. United, former managers from Welsh football club Swansea City, and celebrities: Mexican-American actress Eva Longoria, former international football player Mesut Özil, former NBA basketball player Shawn Marion, MLB baseball player Justin Verlander, and Verlander&#x27;s wife, American model Kate Upton. Necaxa´s backers purchased 5% of Wrexham AFC in April 2024 and its owners Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds, in turn, purchased a minority stake in Necaxa.

On July 9th, 2024, a TV series was ordered with filming beginning on the same day. The series will be similar to Welcome to Wrexham.

<text>Goda of England or Godgifu or Gode (c.1004 – c.1049/1056) was the daughter of King Æthelred the Unready and his second wife Emma of Normandy, and sister of King Edward the Confessor. She married firstly Drogo of Mantes, count of the Véxin, probably on 7 April 1024, and had sons by him:

*Ralph the Timid, earl of Hereford.
*Gautier (or Walter) III, Count of the Vexin (d.1063), married Biota of Maine (d.1063), daughter of Herbert I of Maine, they both died in suspicious circumstances in the captivity of William Duke of Normandy, the future William I of England.
*Foulques (Fulk) de Vexin (d.1068)

She married secondly Eustace II, Count of Boulogne in 1035. This marriage was childless.

Historians disagree about the date of her death. Heather Tanner dates it c.1047 and says that Eustace remarried c.1049, whereas Elisabeth van Houts dates her death c. 1056. According to David Bates, the marriage between Godgifu and Eustace was criticised for unspecified reasons at the Council of Reims in 1049, which was presided over by the Pope. This seems to have resulted in an end to the marriage and her return to England, where she was treated generously by her brother.

After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror, the lands owned by Goda in Buckinghamshire were given to the Flemish-Norman knight Bertram de Verdun, lord of Farnham Royal, and the Breton knight Raoul, count of Fougères.

<doc id="1221380" wikidata="Q526697" url="?curid=1221380" title="Second Battle of Rappahannock Station">
<text>The Second Battle of Rappahannock Station took place on November 7, 1863, near the village of Rappahannock Station (now Remington, Virginia), on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad.

It was between Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Jubal Early and Union forces under Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick as part of the Bristoe Campaign of the American Civil War.

The battle resulted in a victory for the Union.

==Background==
After the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, the Union and Confederate armies drifted south and for three months sparred with one another on the rolling plains of northern Virginia. Little was accomplished, however, and in late October General Robert E. Lee withdrew his Confederate army behind the Rappahannock River, a line he hoped to maintain throughout the winter.

A single pontoon bridge at the town of Rappahannock Station was the only connection Lee retained with the northern bank of the river. The bridge was protected by a bridgehead on the north bank consisting on two redoubts and connecting trenches. Confederate batteries posted on hills south of the river gave additional strength to the position.

The bridgehead was an integral part of Lee&#x27;s strategy to defend the Rappahannock River line. As he later explained, by holding the bridgehead he could &quot;threaten any flank movement the enemy might make above or below, and thus compel him to divide his forces, when it was hoped that an opportunity would be presented to concentrate on one or the other part.&quot; The Union Army of the Potomac&#x27;s commander, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, divided his forces just as Lee expected. He ordered Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick to attack the Confederate position at Rappahannock Station while Maj. Gen. William H. French forced a crossing five miles downstream at Kelly&#x27;s Ford. Once both Sedgwick and French were safely across the river, the reunited army would proceed to Brandy Station.

==Battle==
The operation went according to plan. Shortly after noon on November 7, French drove back Confederate defenders at Kelly&#x27;s Ford and crossed the river. As he did so, Sedgwick advanced toward Rappahannock Station. Lee learned of these developments sometime after noon and immediately put his troops in motion to meet the enemy. His plan was to resist Sedgwick with a small force at Rappahannock Station while attacking French at Kelly&#x27;s Ford with the larger part of his army. The success of the plan depended on his ability to maintain the Rappahannock Station bridgehead until French was defeated.

Sedgwick first engaged the Confederates at 3 p.m. when Maj. Gen. Albion P. Howe&#x27;s division of the VI Corps drove in Confederate skirmishers and seized a range of high ground three-quarters of a mile from the river. Howe placed Union batteries on these hills that pounded the enemy earthworks with a &quot;rapid and vigorous&quot; fire. Confederate guns across the river returned the fire, but with little effect.

Maj. Gen. Jubal Early&#x27;s division occupied the bridgehead defenses that day. Early posted Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays&#x27;s Louisiana brigade and Captain Charles A. Green&#x27;s four gun Louisiana Guard Artillery in the works and at 4:30 p.m. reinforced them with three North Carolina regiments led by Colonel Archibald Godwin. The addition of Godwin&#x27;s troops increased the number of Confederate defenders at the bridgehead to nearly 2,000.

Sedgwick continued shelling the Confederates throughout the late afternoon, but otherwise he showed no disposition to attack. As the day drew to a close, Lee became convinced that the movement against the bridgehead was merely a feint to cover French&#x27;s crossing farther downstream. He was mistaken. At dusk the shelling stopped, and Sedgwick&#x27;s infantry rushed suddenly upon the works. Col. Peter Ellmaker&#x27;s brigade advanced adjacent to the railroad, preceded by skirmishers of the 6th Maine Infantry. &quot;No Union regiment gained more laurels that day nor suffered higher casualties,&quot; according to the National Park Service. At the command &quot;Forward, double-quick!&quot; they surged over the Confederate works and engaged Hays&#x27;s men in hand-to-hand combat. Without assistance, the 6th Maine breached the Confederate line and planted its flags on the parapet of the easternmost redoubt. Moments later the 5th Wisconsin swarmed over the walls of the western redoubt, likewise wresting it from Confederate control.

On the right, Union forces achieved comparable success. Just minutes after Ellmaker&#x27;s brigade penetrated Hays&#x27;s line, Col. Emory Upton&#x27;s brigade overran Godwin&#x27;s position. Upton reformed his lines inside the Confederate works and sent a portion of the 121st New York to seize the pontoon bridge, while the rest of his command wheeled right to attack the confused Confederate horde now massed at the lower end of the bridgehead.

Confederate resistance dissolved as hundreds of soldiers threw down their arms and surrendered. Others sought to gain the opposite shore by swimming the icy river or by running the gauntlet of Union rifle fire at the bridge. Confederate troops south of the Rappahannock looked on hopelessly as Union soldiers herded their comrades to the rear as prisoners of war.

==Aftermath==
In all, 1,670 Confederates were killed, wounded, or captured in the brief struggle, more than eighty percent of those engaged. Union casualty figures, by contrast, were small: 419 in all.

For the North the battle had been &quot;a complete and glorious victory,&quot; an engagement &quot;as short as it was decisive,&quot; reflecting &quot;infinite credit upon all concerned.&quot; Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright noted that it was the first instance in which Union troops had carried a strongly entrenched Confederate position in the first assault. Brig. Gen. Harry Hays claimed to have been attacked by no less than 20,000 to 25,000 Union soldiers—a figure ten times the actual number.

The battle had been as humiliating for the South as it had been glorious for the North. Two of the Confederacy&#x27;s finest brigades, sheltered behind entrenchments and well supported by artillery, had been routed and captured by an enemy force of equal size. Col. Walter H. Taylor of Lee&#x27;s staff called it, &quot;the saddest chapter in the history of this army,&quot; the result of &quot;miserable, miserable management.&quot; An enlisted soldier put it more plainly. &quot;I don&#x27;t know much about it,&quot; he said, &quot;but it seems to be that our army was surprised.&quot;

Lee would later call on subordinates to submit reports on the battle in an effort to determine what had gone wrong, but on the night of November 7 more pressing matters demanded his attention. Loss of the bridgehead destroyed his plans for an offensive and left his army dangerously extended on a now indefensible front. Meade, acting quickly, might pin Lee&#x27;s army against the Rapidan River just as Lee had tried to pin Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s army against the Rappahannock River one year earlier in the Second Battle of Bull Run. Lee immediately canceled his plans for an attack on French and within hours had his army marching south.

==Battlefield preservation==
As of November 2021, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield where the First and Second Battles of Rappahannock Station were fought. The battleground for both battles is located along the Rappahannock River at Remington, Va. and features visible earthworks as well as bridge and mill ruins. The earthworks at Remington are no longer there and more than 75% of the battlefield has been developed over.

<doc id="1221381" wikidata="Q533025" url="?curid=1221381" title="Nutraceutical">
<text>Nutraceutical is a marketing term used to imply a pharmaceutical effect from a compound or food product that has not been scientifically confirmed or approved to have clinical benefits. In the United States, nutraceuticals are considered and regulated as a subset of foods (such as dietary supplements) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

There are no internationally defined properties of nutraceuticals. Due to the vague, undiscriminating evidence for the biological effects of nutraceutical products, experts have proposed abandoning the term. The word &quot;nutraceutical&quot; is a portmanteau, blending the words &quot;nutrition&quot; and &quot;pharmaceutical.&quot;

==Regulation==
Nutraceuticals are treated differently in different jurisdictions.

===Canada===
Under Canadian law, a nutraceutical can be marketed as either a food or a drug; the terms &quot;nutraceutical&quot; and &quot;functional food&quot; have no legal distinction, as both refer to &quot;a product isolated or purified from foods that is generally sold in medicinal forms not usually associated with food [and] is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease.&quot;

===United States===
The term &quot;nutraceutical&quot; is not defined by the FDA. Depending on its ingredients and the claims with which it is marketed, a product is regulated as a drug, dietary supplement, food ingredient, or food.

===Other sources===
In the global market, there are significant product quality issues. Nutraceuticals from the international market may claim to use organic or ingredients, yet the lack of regulation may compromise the safety and effectiveness of products. Companies looking to create a wide profit margin may create unregulated products overseas with low-quality or ineffective ingredients.

==Classification of nutraceuticals==
Nutraceuticals are products derived from food sources that are purported to provide extra health benefits, in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods. Depending on the jurisdiction, products may claim to prevent chronic diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, increase life expectancy, or support the structure or function of the body.

===Dietary supplements===
In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 defined the term &quot;dietary supplement&quot;: &quot;A dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a &#x27;dietary ingredient&#x27; intended to supplement the diet. The &#x27;dietary ingredients&#x27; in these products may include: vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glandulars, and metabolites. Dietary supplements can also be extracts or concentrates, and may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders.&quot;

Dietary supplements do not have to be approved by the FDA before marketing, but companies must register their manufacturing facilities with the FDA and follow current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs). With a few well-defined exceptions, dietary supplements may only be marketed to support the structure or function of the body, and may not claim to treat a disease or condition, and must include a label that says: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” The exceptions are when the FDA has reviewed and approved a health claim. In those situations the FDA also stipulates the exact wording allowed.

===Functional foods===

Functional foods are fortified or enriched during processing and then marketed as providing some benefit to consumers. Sometimes, additional complementary nutrients are added, such as vitamin D to milk.

Health Canada defines functional foods as &quot;ordinary food that has components or ingredients added to give it a specific medical or physiological benefit, other than a purely nutritional effect.&quot; In Japan, all functional foods must meet three established requirements: foods should be (1) present in their naturally occurring form, rather than a capsule, tablet, or powder; (2) consumed in the diet as often as daily; and (3) should regulate a biological process in hopes of preventing or controlling disease.

==Possible clinical application==
Nutraceuticals have been considered as possible adjuncts to therapies for clinical disorders.

==Market==
The modern nutraceutical market developed in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast to the natural herbs and spices used as folk medicine for centuries throughout Asia, the nutraceutical industry grew alongside the expansion of modern technology in the early 21st century. 

The market for nutraceuticals is projected to grow to about 614 billion euros (approx. US$675 billion; 2023) by the year 2027.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;nutraceutical&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;nutrition&quot; and &quot;pharmaceutical&quot;, coined in 1989 by Stephen L. DeFelice.

==Criticism==
Because nutraceuticals are unregulated, these supplements are sold by marketing hype rather than being based on actual clinical evidence. There is no compelling evidence for efficacy in nutraceuticals. After scientists disputed the benefits of nutraceuticals, such as probiotics in yogurt, Danone was forced to pay a large financial penalty for falsely claiming its products Actimel and Activia boosted the immune system.

<doc id="1221386" wikidata="Q2348046" url="?curid=1221386" title="Flame of Recca">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nobuyuki Anzai. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from March 1995 to January 2002, with its chapters collected in 33 volumes.

The series was adapted into a 42-episode anime television series by Pierrot, broadcast on Fuji TV from July 1997 to July 1998. The series has also spawned two video games and other merchandise. Both the anime and manga were licensed for North American distribution in English by Viz Media. The anime has since been picked up by Discotek Media who re-released the series on DVD in 2015.

The &quot;Flame of Recca&quot; manga has had over 25 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series.

==Plot==

&quot;Flame of Recca&quot; follows the story of a teenage boy named Recca Hanabishi, who is interested in ninja and claims to be one himself. He often gets into fights because he made it publicly known that the person who manages to defeat him will earn his services as a loyal ninja. Despite this, he eventually pledges his loyalty and services as a ninja to Yanagi Sakoshita, a girl with the innate ability to heal any wound/injury, because of her kindness and compassion. Recca soon discovers that he possesses the innate ability to control/manipulate flames, and eventually learns that he is actually the son of the sixth generation leader of the Hokage, a ninja clan that was wiped out in 1576, roughly 400 years before the series&#x27; present day.

The Hokage ninjas wielded mystical objects called , which are referred to as &quot;psychic devices&quot; or &quot;mystical weapons&quot; in the English versions of the series. &quot;Madōgu&quot; grant their users special abilities, such as allowing their users to manipulate certain elements (as in the case of the &quot;Fūjin&quot;, which allows its wielder to manipulate the element of wind) and enhancing their user&#x27;s strength/skills (as in the case of the &quot;Dosei no Wa&quot;, which increases its user&#x27;s physical strength and the &quot;Idaten&quot;, which increases its user&#x27;s running speed). Oda Nobunaga had invaded the Hokage in 1576 for the purpose of acquiring these weapons, and the series&#x27; main antagonist, Kōran Mori, is searching for a &quot;madōgu&quot; that will grant him eternal life. Recca and his friends become entangled in Mori&#x27;s quest for eternal life as he attempts to kidnap Yanagi, believing that her healing powers will help him achieve immortality. This leads them to join the &quot;Ura Butō Satsujin&quot;, a tournament wherein the warriors that wield &quot;madōgu&quot; gather to battle each other. After winning the tournament, Recca and his teammates discover that Mori was on his way to acquire the , a &quot;madōgu&quot; said to grant its user eternal life, and once again attempt to stop him.

==Production==

Prior to its publication, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; had suggested different titles including &quot;Recca 100 °C&quot; and &quot;Kattobi Recca&quot;. Author Nobuyuki Anzai also stated the finalized Japanese title &quot;Rekka no Honō&quot; was originally spelled with the kanji character before changing it to the more modern at the last minute. His editor commented that the use of the former character made it sound like a historical drama and Anzai responded that it would contain such elements.

<doc id="1221389" wikidata="Q1194894" url="?curid=1221389" title="Customary international law">
<text>Customary international law consists of international legal obligations arising from established or usual international practices, which are less formal customary expectations of behavior often unwritten as opposed to formal written treaties or conventions. Along with general principles of law and treaties, custom is considered by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, and its member states to be among the primary sources of international law. 

Many governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it. A rule becomes customary international if two requirements are met: (1) There is a state practice that &quot;appears to be sufficiently widespread, representative as well as consistent&quot; showing that a significant number of states have used and relied on the rule in question and the concept has not been rejected by a significant number of states, (2) states were motivated by a belief that they were legally compelled to accept the legitimacy of the rule in question because customary international law obligated them to do so .

In 1950, the International Law Commission listed the following sources as forms of evidence of customary international law: treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations. In 2018, the Commission adopted Conclusions on Identification of Customary International Law with commentaries. The United Nations General Assembly welcomed the Conclusions and encouraged their widest possible dissemination.

==Recognition==

The International Court of Justice Statute defines customary international law in Article 38(1)(b) as &quot;a general practice accepted as law&quot;. This is generally determined through two factors: the general practice of states, and what states have accepted as law (). This means that many states need to engage in the practice (in particular, great powers) and that states engage in the practice out of a sense of legal obligation (rather than custom or habit).

There are several kinds of customary international laws recognized by states. Some customary international laws rise to the level of through acceptance by the international community as non-derogable rights, while other customary international law may simply be followed by a small group of states. States are typically bound by customary international law, regardless of whether the states have codified these laws domestically or through treaties.
A peremptory norm (also called , Latin for &quot;compelling law&quot;) is a fundamental principle of international law which is accepted by the international community of states as a non-derogable norm. These norms are rooted in natural law principles, and any laws conflicting with it should be considered null and void. Examples include various international crimes; a state violates customary international law if it permits or engages in slavery, torture, genocide, war of aggression, or crimes against humanity.

 and customary international law are not interchangeable. All are customary international law through their adoption by states, but not all customary international laws rise to the level of peremptory norms. States can deviate from customary international law by enacting treaties and conflicting laws, but are non-derogable.

== Codification ==
Some international customary laws have been codified through treaties and domestic laws, while others are recognized only as customary law.

The laws of war, also known as , were long a matter of customary law before they were codified in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, Geneva Conventions, and other treaties. However, these conventions do not purport to govern all legal matters that may arise during war. Instead, Article 1(2) of Additional Protocol I dictates that customary international law governs legal matters concerning armed conflict not covered by other agreements.

===Silence as consent===
Generally, sovereign nations must consent in order to be bound by a particular treaty or legal norm. However, international customary laws are norms that have become pervasive enough internationally that countries need not consent in order to be bound. In these cases, all that is needed is that the state has not objected to the law. However, states that object to customary international law may not be bound by them unless these laws are deemed to be . However, in a dispute with any nation that has not affirmed the &quot;silence implies consent&quot; principle, any invocation of the &quot;silence implies consent&quot; principle involves an appeal to custom, such that if that nation does not espouse the broader premise of acknowledging the existence of customary international law, such an appeal will depend on circular reasoning (&quot;customary international law is binding because silence implies consent, and silence implies consent because the fact that silence implies consent is one aspect of customary international law&quot;).

==The International Court of Justice==
The Statute of the International Court of Justice acknowledges the existence of customary international law in Article 38(1)(b), incorporated into the United Nations Charter by Article 92: &quot;The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such as disputes that are submitted to it, shall apply ... international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law.&quot;

Article 38(1)(b) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, has recognized International Custom as evidence of general practice accepted as law. Thus, general practice demonstrates custom, and not vice versa. In order to prove the existence of customary rule, it is necessary to show that there exists a &#x27;general practice&#x27; which conforms to the rule and which is accepted as law.

Customary international law &quot;consists of rules of law derived from the consistent conduct of States acting out of the belief that the law required them to act that way&quot;. It follows that customary international law can be discerned by a &quot;widespread repetition by States of similar international acts over time (state practice); Acts must occur out of sense of obligation (); Acts must be taken by a significant number of States and not be rejected by a significant number of States.&quot; A marker of customary international law is consensus among states exhibited both by widespread conduct and a discernible sense of obligation.

The two essential elements of customary international law are state practice and , as confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the &quot;Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons&quot;.

In relation to the psychological element that is , the International Court of Justice further held in &quot;North Sea Continental Shelf&quot; that &quot;not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it ... The States concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation.&quot; The Court emphasised the need to prove a &quot;sense of legal duty&quot; as distinct from &quot;acts motivated by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition&quot;. This was subsequently confirmed in &quot;Nicaragua v. United States of America&quot;.

==Bilateral vs. multilateral==
The recognition of different customary laws can range from simple bilateral recognition of customary laws to worldwide multilateral recognition. Regional customs can become customary international law in their respective regions, but do not become customary international law for nations outside the region. The existence of bilateral customary law was recognized by the International Court of Justice in the &quot;Right of Passage Over Indian Territory&quot; case between Portugal and India, in which the court found &quot;no reason why long continued practice between the two states accepted by them as regulating their relations should not form the basis of mutual rights and obligations between the two states&quot;.

==Other examples==
Other examples accepted or claimed as customary international law include immunity of visiting foreign heads of state and the principle of non-refoulement. In 1993, the United Nations Security Council adopted the Geneva Conventions as customary international law.

If any treaty or law has been called as customary international law, then parties which have not ratified said treaty will be bound to observe its provisions in good faith.

<doc id="1221396" wikidata="Q3279112" url="?curid=1221396" title="Wide Open Spaces (album)">
<text>Wide Open Spaces is the fourth studio album and the major label debut of American country music band Dixie Chicks. It was their first record with new lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and became their breakthrough commercial success. It received diamond status by the RIAA on February 20, 2003, in the United States, having shipped 13 million units worldwide, while spending more than six years in the Australian ARIA music charts Country Top 20.

&quot;Once You&#x27;ve Loved Somebody&quot; had previously been recorded by John &amp; Audrey Wiggins on their 1996 album, &quot;The Dream&quot;.

&quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;, as well as their next albums &quot;Fly&quot; (1999) and &quot;Home&quot; (2002), were released in the HDCD format.

In 2024, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Upon its release, &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; received favorable reviews from critics. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, simply stating that the &quot;blonds have more brains (than they get credit for).&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;this tradition-rooted Texas trio knows its way around country, western, honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and country-rock.&quot; Concluding the review, it deemed that the &quot;range, plus their sweet, assured three-part harmonies, Natalie Maines&#x27; attractively steely lead vocals, and savvy song selection have propelled this major-label debut into the Top 10.&quot;

In a retrospective review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, he stated that it hit a &quot;sweet spot&quot; and described the album as &quot;appealing to many different audiences&quot; and &quot;eclectic without being elitist.&quot; He described Natalie Maines&#x27; voice as &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;bluesy&quot; to &quot;give these songs a compelling center&quot; and &quot;versatile&quot; to &quot;[negotiate] the twists and turns of these songs without a hitch, easily moving from the vulnerability of &quot;You Were Mine&quot; to the snarl of &quot;Give It Up or Let Me Go.&quot; Concluding his review, he praised the &quot;remarkably wide range&quot; as &quot;effortlessly eclectic&quot; and the group for &quot;bringing [the album] all together with their attitude and understated musicality.&quot;

<doc id="1221403" wikidata="Q4793569" url="?curid=1221403" title="Arming yeast">
<text>Arming yeast is a tool in biotechnology and biological research where a protein of interest is expressed on the surface of yeast cells. This is used in industrial settings for expression of enzymes to serve as catalysts in reactions, as well as in pharmaceutical settings for screening drug candidates. &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is most commonly used as arming yeast because it is easy to grow, can be genetically manipulated, and is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

== Mechanisms ==
The most common mechanism of arming yeast is to fuse a protein of interest to the extracellular domain of the yeast mating protein α-agglutinin.

== Uses ==
Arming yeast have been used for a variety of industrial and research processes. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; armed with a glucoamylase from &quot;Rhizopus oryzae&quot; have been used to break down starches in the production of ethanol. Similarly, yeast expressing endoglucanase from &quot;Trichoderma reesei&quot; as well as β-glucosidase from &quot;Aspergillus aculeatus&quot; were used to break down agricultural waste into material which can be turned into ethanol.

<doc id="1221418" wikidata="Q371058" url="?curid=1221418" title="Westin Bonaventure Hotel">
<text>The Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites is a , 33-story hotel in Los Angeles, California, constructed between 1974 and 1977. It was designed by architect John C. Portman Jr.. The top floor has a revolving restaurant and bar. It was originally owned by investors that included a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corporation and John Portman &amp; Associates. The building is managed by Aimbridge Hospitality (IHR), and is valued at $200 million.

The hotel and its architect John Portman have been the subject of several documentaries and academic analyses.

==Reactions==

Fredric Jameson discusses the hotel in his 1984 essay, &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot;, and in his 1991 book by the same name. He writes thatthe Bonaventura aspires to being a total space, a complete world, a kind of miniature city (and I would want to add that to this new total space corresponds a new collective practice, a new mode in which individuals move and congregate, something like the practice of a new and historically original kind of hyper-crowd).In his book &quot;Postmodern Geographies: The Reassertion of Space in Critical Social Theory&quot; (1989), Edward Soja describes the hotel asa concentrated representation of the restructured spatiality of the late capitalist city: fragmented and fragmenting, homogeneous and homogenizing, divertingly packaged yet curiously incomprehensible, seemingly open in presenting itself to view but constantly pressing to enclose, to compartmentalize, to circumscribe, to incarcerate. Everything imaginable appears to be available in this micro-urb but real places are difficult to find, its spaces confuse an effective cognitive mapping, its pastiche of superficial reflections bewilder co-ordination and encourage submission instead. Entry by land is forbidding to those who carelessly walk but entrance is nevertheless encouraged at many different levels. Once inside, however, it becomes daunting to get out again without bureaucratic assistance. In so many ways, its architecture recapitulates and reflects the sprawling manufactured spaces of Los Angeles.

==Floors and elevators==
The hotel is a 33-story building, with no floors numbered &quot;7&quot; or &quot;13&quot;; the top floor is therefore numbered &quot;35&quot;. The four elevator banks (each containing three cars for a total of 12) are named by colors and symbols: Red Circle (the only one that goes to &quot;35&quot;; the other three only go to &quot;32&quot;), Yellow Diamond, Green Square, and Blue Triangle. The color-coded system of directions was a later addition, as visitors found the space confusing and hard to navigate.

==Location filming==

Several bronze plaques commemorate elevator scenes from three major films:

* &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;, September 1993, &quot;Green Square&quot; elevator
* &quot;True Lies&quot;, September 1993, &quot;Red Circle&quot; and &quot;Yellow Diamond&quot; elevators
* &quot;Forget Paris&quot;, November 1994, &quot;Yellow Diamond&quot; elevator

It has been featured in many movies and television series over the years, including &quot;The Driver&quot;, &quot;Interstellar&quot;,&quot;&quot; &quot;Strange Days&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; (as part of the city of New Chicago), &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Breathless&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;Nick of Time&quot;, &quot;Rain Man&quot;, &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;My Fellow Americans, Midnight Madness&quot;, Moonlighting (TV series), &quot;Showtime&quot;, &quot;Hard to Kill&quot;, &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, &quot;Chuck&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;The New Dragnet&quot;, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, &quot;Zoolander&quot;, &quot;MaXXXine&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 2,&quot; &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot; and was destroyed (via special effects) in &quot;Escape from LA&quot;, &quot;Epicenter&quot;, and &quot;San Andreas&quot;. The front of the hotel was also featured in the British children’s television series Tots Tv ‘American Adventure’ special where Tilly, Tom and Tiny went to explore a different country and were observing tall buildings and went onto the roof of the hotel to observe the view of Los Angeles. While under construction, it appeared in the 1975 film &quot;The Wilderness Family&quot; (released a year before the hotel opened). In cartoon form, the building can be seen in the first shot of &quot;Jem&quot; in the episode &quot;The Beginning&quot;, and in the anime &quot;Steins;Gate&quot;. In November 1979, the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; videotaped some on location scenes there dealing with Luke Spencer, played by Anthony Geary who was hired to assassinate Senator Mitch Williams. In 1999, &quot;Power Rangers Lost Galaxy&quot; used the building as the administration building of the space colony Terra Venture, with Red Ranger Leo falling from the building after a battle with main villain Trakeena.

In 2002, the hotel was the location for a &quot;Fear Factor&quot; stunt which involved crossing a bridge of plexiglass discs on cables suspended on the lobby&#x27;s fifth floor. The television series &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot; was set in a restaurant atop the Bonaventure. The hotel is also showcased in episodes of &quot;&quot; and its exterior can be seen in &quot;Americathon&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Almighty Thor&quot;, &quot;Hancock&quot;, and at the beginning of the Lionel Richie &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot; music video. The building made appearances in the 2002 Aaliyah music video &quot;More Than a Woman&quot;, 1991 Kylie Minogue music video &quot;Step Back in Time&quot;, the 1985 Survivor music video &quot;The Search Is Over&quot;, the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, the 2012 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot; (in the &quot;Aftermath&quot; multiplayer map) and in the 2013 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; with the name &quot;Arcadius Business Center&quot; (having three towers instead of four towers and featuring glass elevator animations).

The hotel was also used as a setting for R&amp;B singer Usher&#x27;s music video for the 2002 hit single, &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot;. A pivotal scene in the season four (2005) episode &quot;Another Mister Sloane&quot; of the espionage drama &quot;Alias&quot; took place in the Bonaventure Hotel as well, while it was also featured in season one (2017), episode five of another espionage drama, &quot;Counterpart&quot;. In 2021, Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Savage x Fenty Show Vol. 3&quot; was filmed entirely on location at the hotel. The hotel also hosted the first task for the final leg of &quot;The Amazing Race 33&quot;, which aired in 2022.

<doc id="1221420" wikidata="Q143986" url="?curid=1221420" title="William Greer">
<text>William Robert Greer (September 22, 1909 – February 23, 1985) was an Irish-born agent of the U.S. Secret Service, best known as being the driver of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential limousine in the motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas on November 22, 1963, when the president was assassinated.

==History==
Greer was born on a farm in Stewartstown, County Tyrone, Ireland, and emigrated to the United States in 1929. He worked for over a decade as a chauffeur and servant to several wealthy families, including the Lodge family in Boston and a family in Dobbs Ferry, New York. During World War II, Greer enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the presidential yacht in May, 1944. After his discharge in 1945, he joined the United States Secret Service on October 1 of that year. In 2013 it was publicly discovered that while in Ireland he had been a member of the Drumbonaway lodge of the Orange Order.

Greer&#x27;s duties brought him into close contact with Kennedy, and he can be seen in several pictures with the Kennedy family. He chauffeured the president on many occasions, including in Dallas. As with all agents involved, there has much speculation about, and criticism of, his actions on that day. Greer testified before the Warren Commission on March 9, 1964. Greer testified that he heard three shots, the first he thought was the backfire of a motorcycle and so did not react. About three or four seconds later he heard a second shot which prompted him to turn around and as he did so he noticed Governor Connally was wounded. He describes the second and third shots as occurring &quot;simultaneously, one behind the other&quot;. According to Greer&#x27;s nephew, Ken Torrens, when he asked Greer if he thought Oswald was guilty he replied &quot;No comment&quot; and that &quot;I’m not allowed to talk about it&quot;.

Greer retired on disability from the Secret Service in 1966 due to a stomach ulcer that grew worse following the Kennedy assassination. In 1973 he relocated to Waynesville, North Carolina, where he later died of cancer.

==Analysis and criticism==
Secret Service procedures in place at the time did not allow Greer to take action without orders from senior agent Roy Kellerman, who sat to Greer&#x27;s right. Kellerman has stated that he shouted, &quot;Let&#x27;s get out of line, we&#x27;ve been hit,&quot; but that Greer apparently turned to look at Kennedy before accelerating the car.

No agents were disciplined for their performance during the shooting, but privately, Jackie Kennedy was bitterly critical of the agents&#x27; performance, Greer&#x27;s in particular, comparing him to the Kennedy children&#x27;s nanny. Greer later apologized to her, as William Manchester recounted in his semi-authorized account of the assassination: &quot;Bill Greer, his face streaked with tears, took her head between his hands and squeezed until she thought he was going to squeeze her skull flat. He cried, &#x27;Oh, Mrs. Kennedy, oh my God, oh my God. I didn’t mean to do it, I didn’t hear, I should have swerved (sic) the car, I couldn’t help it. Oh, Mrs. Kennedy, as soon as I saw it I swerved. If only I’d seen in time! Oh!&#x27; Then he released her head and put his arms around her and wept on her shoulder.&quot;

<doc id="1221425" wikidata="Q368489" url="?curid=1221425" title="Los Angeles City Hall">
<text>Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928, is the center of the government of the city of Los Angeles, California, and houses the mayor&#x27;s office and the meeting chambers and offices of the Los Angeles City Council. It is located in the Civic Center district of downtown Los Angeles in the city block bounded by Main, Temple, First, and Spring streets, which was the heart of the city&#x27;s central business district during the 1880s and 1890s.

==History==
The building was designed by John Parkinson, John C. Austin, and Albert C. Martin, Sr., and was completed in 1928. Dedication ceremonies were held on April 26, 1928. It has 32 floors and, at high, is the tallest base-isolated structure in the world, having undergone a seismic retrofit from 1998 to 2001, so that the building will sustain minimal damage and remain functional after a magnitude 8.2 earthquake. The concrete in its tower was made with sand from each of California&#x27;s 58 counties and water from its 21 historical missions. City Hall&#x27;s distinctive tower was modelled after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, and shows the influence of the Los Angeles Public Library, completed shortly before the structure was begun. An image of City Hall has been on Los Angeles Police Department badges since 1940.

A City Council ordinance passed in 1905 did not permit any new construction to be taller than 13 stories or in order to keep the city&#x27;s architecture harmonious. City Hall&#x27;s height was deemed exempt as a public building and assured that no building would surpass one third its height for over three decades until the ordinance was repealed by voter referendum in 1957. Therefore, from its completion in 1928 until finally surpassed by the topping off of Union Bank Plaza in 1966, City Hall was the tallest building in Los Angeles and shared the skyline with only a few structures such as the Continental Building, the only property built taller than prior to the ordinance, and the Richfield Tower and Eastern Columbia Building, which exceeded the ordinance through a loophole allowing for decorative towers.

City Hall has an observation deck, free to the public and open Monday through Friday during business hours. The peak of the pyramid at the top of the building is an airplane beacon named in honor of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh, the Lindbergh Beacon. Circa 1939, there was an art gallery, in Room 351 on the third floor, that exhibited paintings by California artists.

The building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1976.

In 1998 the building was closed during a total $135 million refurbishment which also included upgrading it so it could withstand a magnitude 8.2 earthquake, including permitting it to sway in a quake.

==Previous city halls==

Prior to the completion of the current structure, the L.A. City Council utilized various other buildings:

* 1850s: used rented hotel and other buildings for city meetings
* 1860s: rented adobe house on Spring Street—across from current City Hall (now parking lot for Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center)
* 1860s–1884: relocated to Los Angeles County Court House
* 1884–1888: moved to Mirror Building at South Spring Street and West 2nd Street (site of former Los Angeles Times Building)
* 1888–1928: moved to new Romanesque Revival building on 226-238 South Broadway between 2nd Street and 3rd Street; demolished in 1928 and now site of parking lot between LA Times parking structure and 240 Broadway. Beams from the building ended up repurposed in the construction of writer Frank Scully&#x27;s 1936 Mediterranean Revival home at 2071 Grace Ave, in the Whitley Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles.

==Usage==

The Mayor of Los Angeles has an office in room 300. Every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10:00 am, the Los Angeles City Council meets in its chamber.

An observation level is open to the public on the 27th floor. This floor&#x27;s interior comprises a single large and highly vaulted room distinguished by the iconic tall square columns that are far more familiar as one of the building&#x27;s most distinguishing exterior features. As this ample interior space is named, the Mayor Tom Bradley Room is used for ceremonies and other special occasions.

City Hall and the adjacent federal, state, and county buildings are served by the Civic Center station on the Metro B and D subway lines and the Historic Broadway station on the Metro A and E light rail lines. The J Line stops in front of the building.

The Los Angeles Dodgers wore a commemorative uniform patch during the 2018 season celebrating 60 years in the city depicting a logo of Los Angeles City Hall.

==Filming location==

The building has been featured in the following popular movies and television shows. It also appears incidentally as an icon of officialdom in many movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

* &quot;While the City Sleeps&quot; (1928): The newly constructed building appears in the background of some exterior shots in this silent crime drama starring Lon Chaney, even though the film is set in New York.
* &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;: The building appears as the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building beginning in the second season of the 1950s TV series. At the time the TV program was broadcast, the show&#x27;s &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building (Los Angeles City Hall) was frequently confused with the similarly designed Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Building in Allentown, also built in 1928. Additionally, the exact design of this building is used as the &quot;Newstime&quot; magazine headquarters in the Superman comic books.
* &quot;Alias&quot;: A CIA black ops unit is located behind a maintenance door at Civic Station.
* &quot;Dragnet&quot;: The building appears as itself in the TV series. The first episode of &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1951) Season 1, Episode 1: &quot;The Human Bomb&quot;, original air date 16 December 1951, was filmed at Los Angeles City Hall. It was embossed on Sgt. Joe Friday&#x27;s famous badge number 714 that was displayed under the credits.
* &quot;Perry Mason&quot;: The City Hall building appears in the view from Perry&#x27;s office window. This has led viewers of the show to speculate where the fictional office would have been located in downtown Los Angeles.
* &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;: The police in the 1997 neo-noir film operate out of the City Hall, as well as the police badges featuring a depiction the building itself. At the time the film takes place no building in Los Angeles was allowed to be taller than City Hall, so the cameras were placed at certain points so that any building taller than City Hall would not be seen.
* &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;: In this 1997 made-for-TV movie, the main character&#x27;s love interest works at a fictional newspaper, &quot;The Los Angeles Banner.&quot; The newspaper&#x27;s logo is based on the top of City Hall.
* &quot;Adam-12&quot;: During the seventh season opening credits montage, City Hall is shown directly at the end, as the building that officers Reed and Malloy drive away from. It is also shown on the embossed badges numbered 744 (Malloy) and 2430 (Reed).
* The 2003 &quot;Dragnet&quot; series used the L.A. City Hall building aerial shot and badge throughout its introduction.
* &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;: The City Hall was destroyed (albeit by miniature) in the 1953 film version (although the H. G. Wells book has the aliens attacking London, the setting was changed to Los Angeles for the film).
* &quot;V&quot;: City Hall was destroyed when the Visitors attack Earth. The same footage of the tower being destroyed from &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; was used but with different energy weapons superimposed.
* The 1976 film &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; included a scene both shot and set in the city council chamber that included a close-up of the electronic voting board with the names of the incumbent council members.
* The 1991 music video for Prince&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; features City Hall as the primary location.
* AFI&#x27;s music video for their 2006 song &quot;Miss Murder&quot; was filmed at City Hall.
* The 2011 film &quot;Atlas Shrugged: Part I&quot;.
* The 2011 series &quot;&quot; used the main entrance of City Hall to represent the CIA archive Esther Drummond visits in &quot;The New World&quot;, and the exterior to the medical conference where Vera Juarez meets Jilly Kitzinger in &quot;Rendition&quot;/&quot;Dead of Night&quot;.
* The 2013 film &quot;The Employer&quot; uses City Hall as the headquarters of the fictional Carcharias Corporation.
* The 2013 film &quot;Gangster Squad&quot; features the Los Angeles City Hall, with the members of the Gangster Squad stood in the foreground of the building, as well as it being used in the background of some scenes. Mayor Villaraigosa&#x27;s conference room was also used for the office of Police Chief Parker.
* &quot;The Amazing Race 25&quot;: City Hall appeared during the season finale, with teams having to bring a film permit to the building.

<doc id="1221428" wikidata="Q3286786" url="?curid=1221428" title="Fly (Dixie Chicks album)">
<text>Fly is the fifth studio album (second major label) by American country music band the Dixie Chicks, released on August 31, 1999 through Monument Records. Compared to their previous album and breakthrough &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; (1998), the group had a stronger hand in writing, co-writing five of the fourteen tracks. The album was produced by Blake Chancey and Paul Worley, both of whom had already produced &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;.

The album was widely praised, even more so than their prior album and has been regarded as one of the best country albums of the &#x27;90s decade. The album was a massive commercial success for the group, debuting at the top of the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums with 341,000 copies sold first week, becoming the most successful country album of 2000 and making the group the first ever country group in history to debut at number one on the former chart. The album was also moderately successful internationally, debuting atop the Canadian country albums chart and peaking at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart, while also peaking within the top 40 in the album charts in Australia, Finland, and the United Kingdom.

Eight singles were released from &quot;Fly&quot;, including the Hot Country Songs number one hits &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;, along with their then-highest charting entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, which peaked at number 19. Other successful hits from the record include country top ten hits &quot;Ready to Run&quot; from the &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Cold Day in July&quot;, &quot;If I Fall You&#x27;re Going Down with Me&quot;, and &quot;Some Days You Gotta Dance&quot;, with the latter having been originally recorded by The Ranch for their only studio album. Original member Keith Urban plays guitar on the Dixie Chicks&#x27;s version.

The album earned four Grammy nominations in 2000: Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for &quot;Ready to Run&quot;, Best Country Album, Album of the Year, and Best Country Song also for &quot;Ready to Run&quot; and its two writers Marcus Hummon and member Martie Maguire (then Martie Seidel), with the group winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance and Best Country Album.

On June 25, 2002, the album was certified Diamond by the RIAA for selling ten million copies, making the Chicks the only country group to have two diamond albums after &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;. In 2020, the album was ranked at 224 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Fly&quot; debuted at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top Country Albums chart the week of September 18, 1999, selling 341,000 copies in its debut week, giving the Dixie Chicks the second biggest opening week for any country act in the 90&#x27;s only behind Garth Brooks and the third overall in any week behind Brooks and LeAnn Rimes. &quot;Fly&quot; would go on to spend 131 weeks on the former chart, being the group&#x27;s second consecutive album to spend more than two years on the chart after &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; (1998) spend 134 weeks. Internationally, the album performed decently well. &quot;Fly&quot; debuted at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart and topped the &quot;RPM&quot; Canada Country Albums chart. The album was also successful in Australia, debuting the week of September 19, 1999 at its peak position of number 16 and spent eight weeks in total. The album performed poorly in the United Kingdom, where country music already isn&#x27;t that popular. It debuted on September 11, 1999 at its peak position of number 38 and only spent five weeks on the chart in total. However, &quot;Fly&quot; performed much better in the UK&#x27;s country albums chart, where it peaked at number two and would go on to spend 70 weeks in the top ten.

==Track listing==
Note
Track 13 is unlisted on the back cover and disc, though it is listed as &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Thang But a Chicken Wang&quot; in the booklet. On some pressings of the CD, &quot;Heartbreak Town&quot; lasts 3:47 on track 12 and fades into track 13, which plays the last six seconds of the song. On other pressings of the CD, track 12 lasts for the full 3:53 seconds, and track 13 contains no audio, only lasting for 0:01. Digital versions of the album remove the blank track completely, bumping &quot;Let Him Fly&quot; up to track 13.

<text>Mount Albert () is an inner suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, which is centred on Ōwairaka / Mount Albert, a local volcanic peak which dominates the landscape. By 1911, growth in the area had increased to the point where Mount Albert was declared an independent borough, which was later absorbed into Auckland. The suburb is located to the southwest of the Auckland City Centre.

==Geography==
The suburb is centred around Ōwairaka / Mount Albert, a volcano which erupted an estimated 120,000 years ago. Ōwairaka / Mount Albert is one of the older volcanoes in the Auckland volcanic field, and the westernmost volcanic feature. Approximately 28,000 years ago, Te Kōpuke / Mount Saint John erupted, causing a lava flow in northern Mount Albert, which flowed into the Waitematā Harbour and created the Meola Reef.

The Oakley Creek is a major stream on the Auckland isthmus, which forms the western border of the suburb.

==History==
===Early history===
One of the earliest names Tāmaki Māori gave to the volcano was Te Puke o Ruarangi (&quot;The Hill of Ruarangi&quot;). A traditional story involves Ruarangi, a chief of the supernatural Patupaiarehe people, escaping a siege on the volcano through lava tunnels. Other early names include or , means &#x27;the long burning fires of Rakataura&#x27;, referring to its continuous occupation by the Tainui explorer Rakataura. The name Ōwairaka refers to Wairaka, an early Māori ancestor, who was the daughter of Toroa, the captain of the &quot;Mātaatua&quot; voyaging waka. Wairaka fled to Auckland to escape an unwanted marriage, and established her people on the volcano.

During the early 18th century, the Auckland isthmus was heavily populated by the Waiohua confederation of tribes. Ōwairaka / Mount Albert was the western-most hill-top pā of Waiohua and had extensive terraces and cultivations, although not as many as Maungakiekie or Maungawhau to the east. After a conflict between Waiohua and Ngāti Whātua in the mid-18th century, the area became part of the rohe of Ngāti Whātua. Ngāti Whātua had a much smaller population than the Waiohua, and seaside areas were preferred places to live. Because of this, much of the area fell into disuse. The Oakley Creek has been traditionally used by Tāmaki Māori as a source for crayfish, eels and weka. Harakeke (New Zealand flax) and raupō, which grew along the banks of the creek, were harvested here to create Māori traditional textiles.

In 1820, English priest Samuel Marsden visited the area, and climbed to the peak of Ōwairaka / Mount Albert with the paramount chief of Ngāti Whātua, Apihai Te Kawau. The mountain was named during the early colonial era after Prince Albert, husband to Queen Victoria.

===European settlement===
On 29 June 1841, Mount Albert was sold to the Crown by Ngāti Whātua, as a part of a 12,000 acre section. The terrain of the area was rough, meaning the area saw slower development compared to other parts of the Auckland isthmus. In the 1860s, New North Road was established as road access for the area and as an alternative to the Great North Road to the north. Mount Albert area became an area of large estates for wealthy landowners, due to its proximity to Auckland township. Large houses including Alberton and Ferndale House were constructed for the families of the area.

In 1866, the Mt Albert Methodist Church was constructed. Later that year in October 1866, the Mt Albert District Highway Board, the first local government in the area, was formed to administer New North Road and surrounding areas. Tensions existed among the ratepayers of the area, primarily between the &quot;mountain&quot; area ratepayers and the city-side ratepayers in Eden Terrace, who believes that they were paying too high rates for a road that did not lead to any specific location. By June 1875, Eden Terrace had split from the Mt Albert District Highway Board. The first school in the area, Mt Albert School, was established in 1870 on land gifted by John McElwain, at School Road in Morningside.

Early society in Mount Albert centred around the Anglican Church, and figures such as pioneer Allan Kerr Taylor and his wife Sophia Taylor. The Kerr Taylor family renovated their home in the early 1870s, transforming Alberton into an elaborate Anglo-Indian-inspired mansion, that hosted many formal events in the area.

Mount Albert railway station opened in March 1880, connecting Morningside to Auckland city by rail, and spurring suburban growth. In the 10 years after 1881, the population of Mount Albert doubled to 1,400 people. During the latter 19th century, a quarry was established on Ōwairaka / Mount Albert, with a rail spur connecting the quarry to the North Auckland Line. Local residents had become concerned for the mountain, and petitioned the government to stop the quarry in 1895 and 1915. The Railways department chief engineer dismissed the residents&#x27; concerns. By 1905, the summit of the mountain became public land, and the quarry was eventually closed in 1928.

===Suburban development===
By the 1910s, Mount Albert had become one of the fastest growing suburbs of Auckland. The district attracted many families from outside the Anglican community, notably many successful businessmen, who wanted to establish large family homes while still able to commute to Auckland. By 1911, the population of the area had grown to 6,666, and in 1912 the King George V Hall opened, becoming a social hub for Mount Albert. The area was still significantly more rural compared to Kingsland in the north-east, home to many dairy and poultry farms. In 1915, the Auckland tramline reached the suburb, creating suburban growth and leading to the development of the Mount Albert commercial shopping area, originally known as Ohlsen&#x27;s Corner. As the Mount Albert shops developed, the area gained the name the Terminus, as at the time it was the final stop on the tramline along New North Road.

Growth in the area led to the creation of the Borough of Mt Albert on 1 April 1911. The borough took our significant loans, in order to invest in the water supply for the area. Between 1901 and 1931, the population of the area surged from 2,035 to 20,600, making Mount Albert the largest borough in New Zealand. After World War II, a major housing shortage in New Zealand led to the construction of many state housing areas, including the Stewart Estate in Mount Albert.

The Mount Albert shops flourished in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s, Mount Albert had a significantly older population than the surrounding areas of Auckland. In April 1961, the Mount Albert War Memorial Hall, a large modernist community centre, was constructed. Urban Māori and Pasifika communities grew in the area from the 1950s onwards, and increased in the 1970s due to the gentrification of the inner city suburbs close to the Auckland city centre. The Mount Albert shopping village began to go into a decline in the 1970s, after the establishment of the St Lukes Shopping Centre to the north.

By the 1990s, Mount Albert has developed into a multicultural centre in Auckland, with a growth in Indian, Sri Lankan and Chinese communities, in part caused by two tertiary institutes in the area: Unitec Institute of Technology and the Auckland Institute of Studies.

<text>The Speakon (stylized speakON) is a trademarked name for an electrical connector, originally manufactured by Neutrik, mostly used in professional audio systems for connecting loudspeakers to amplifiers. Other manufacturers make compatible products, often under the name &quot;speaker twist connector&quot;.

Speakon connectors are rated for at least 30 A RMS continuous current, higher than 1/4-inch TS phone connectors, two-pole twist lock, and XLR connectors for loudspeakers.

==Design==
A Speakon connector is designed with a locking system that may be designed for soldered or screw-type connections. Line connectors (usually FEMALE with the latch) mate with (usually MALE) panel connectors and typically a cable will have identical connectors at both ends. If it is needed to join cables, a coupler can be used (which essentially consists of two panel connectors mounted on the ends of a plastic tube). The design was conceived in 1987.

Note that MANY users and even connector suppliers are confused by which is a male connector and which is a female, as the Female cable connector does look like it plugs INTO the male chassis connector. The easiest way to remember it is to look at Neutrik part numbers where an &quot;F&quot; indicates Female and an &quot;M denotes Male (eg &quot;NL4FX&quot; is the &#x27;normal&#x27; cable connector (with a latch).

Speakon connectors are designed to be unambiguous in their use in speaker cables. With 1/4&quot; speaker jacks and XLR connections, it is possible for users to erroneously use low-current shielded microphone or instrument cables in a high-current speaker application. Speakon cables are intended solely for use in high current audio applications.

Speakon connectors arrange their contacts in two concentric rings, with the inner contacts named +1, +2, etc. and the outer contacts connectors (in the four-pole and eight-pole version only)
named −1, −2, etc. The phase convention is that positive voltage on the + contact causes air to be pushed away from the speaker.

Speakon connectors are made in two, four and eight-pole configurations. The two-pole line connector will mate with the four-pole panel connector, connecting to +1 and −1; but the reverse combination will not work. The eight-pole connector is physically larger to accommodate the extra poles. The four-pole connector is the most common at least from the availability of ready-made leads, as it allows for things like bi-amping (two of the four connections for the higher-frequency signal, with the other two for the lower-frequency signal) without two separate cables. Similarly, the eight-pole connector could be used for tri-amping (two poles each for low, mid and high frequencies with two unused), or quad-amping (two poles each for high, mid, low and sub).

Another use for the four-pole cable is to carry two channels of amplified signal from an amplifier to a pair of loudspeakers using a &#x27;combiner&#x27; Y-lead connected to the two output channels, and a &#x27;splitter&#x27; Y-lead to feed the loudspeakers. The &#x27;combiner&#x27; and &#x27;splitter&#x27; Y-leads are the same: two two-pole connectors on one end, connected to the ±1 and ±2 pins, respectively, of a four-pole line connector at the other end. Some amplifiers and mixer-amplifiers are configured to do this without the need for a &#x27;combiner&#x27;.

Also available are 2-pole &quot;combo&quot; receptacles that can also accept 4-pole cables and 1/4″ phone plugs.

In 2019 the manufacturer introduced the STX series which included male line connectors and female panel connectors.

<doc id="1221448" wikidata="Q363922" url="?curid=1221448" title="Prompt neutron">
<text>In nuclear engineering, a prompt neutron is a neutron immediately emitted (neutron emission) by a nuclear fission event, as opposed to a delayed neutron decay which can occur within the same context, emitted after beta decay of one of the fission products anytime from a few milliseconds to a few minutes later.

Prompt neutrons emerge from the fission of an unstable fissionable or fissile heavy nucleus almost instantaneously. There are different definitions for how long it takes for a prompt neutron to emerge. For example, the United States Department of Energy defines a prompt neutron as a neutron born from fission within 10−13 seconds after the fission event. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines a prompt neutron as a neutron emerging from fission within 10−14 seconds.
This emission is controlled by the nuclear force and is extremely fast. By contrast, so-called delayed neutrons are delayed by the time delay associated with beta decay (mediated by the weak force) to the precursor excited nuclide, after which neutron emission happens on a prompt time scale (i.e., almost immediately).

==Principle==

Using uranium-235 as an example, this nucleus absorbs a thermal neutron, and the immediate mass products of a fission event are two large fission fragments, which are remnants of the formed uranium-236 nucleus. These fragments emit two or three free neutrons (2.5 on average), called &quot;prompt&quot; neutrons. A subsequent fission fragment occasionally undergoes a stage of radioactive decay that yields an additional neutron, called a &quot;delayed&quot; neutron. These neutron-emitting fission fragments are called &quot;delayed neutron precursor atoms&quot;.

Delayed neutrons are associated with the beta decay of the fission products. After prompt fission neutron emission the residual fragments are still neutron rich and undergo a beta decay chain. The more neutron rich the fragment, the more energetic and faster the beta decay. In some cases the available energy in the beta decay is high enough to leave the residual nucleus in such a highly excited state that neutron emission instead of gamma emission occurs.

==Importance in nuclear fission basic research==

The standard deviation of the final kinetic energy distribution as a function of mass of final fragments from low energy fission of uranium 234 and uranium 236, presents a peak around light fragment masses region and another on heavy fragment masses region. Simulation by Monte Carlo method of these experiments suggests that those peaks are produced by prompt neutron emission. This effect of prompt neutron emission does not provide a primary mass and kinetic distribution which is important to study fission dynamics from saddle to scission point.

==Importance in nuclear reactors==

If a nuclear reactor happened to be prompt critical - even very slightly - the number of neutrons and power output would increase exponentially at a high rate. The response time of mechanical systems like control rods is far too slow to moderate this kind of power surge. The control of the power rise would then be left to its intrinsic physical stability factors, like the thermal dilatation of the core, or the increased resonance absorptions of neutrons, that usually tend to decrease the reactor&#x27;s reactivity when temperature rises; but the reactor would run the risk of being damaged or destroyed by heat.

However, thanks to the delayed neutrons, it is possible to leave the reactor in a subcritical state as far as only prompt neutrons are concerned: the delayed neutrons come a moment later, just in time to sustain the chain reaction when it is going to die out. In that regime, neutron production overall still grows exponentially, but on a time scale that is governed by the delayed neutron production, which is slow enough to be controlled (just as an otherwise unstable bicycle can be balanced because human reflexes are quick enough on the time scale of its instability). Thus, by widening the margins of non-operation and supercriticality and allowing more time to regulate the reactor, the delayed neutrons are essential to inherent reactor safety and even in reactors requiring active control.

==Fraction definitions==

The factor β is defined as:

:formula_1

and it is equal to 0.0064 for U-235.

The delayed neutron fraction (DNF) is defined as:

:formula_2

These two factors, β and &quot;DNF&quot;, are not the same thing in case of a rapid change in the number of neutrons in the reactor.

Another concept, is the &quot;effective fraction of delayed neutrons&quot;, which is the fraction of delayed neutrons weighted (over space, energy, and angle) on the adjoint neutron flux. This concept arises because delayed neutrons are emitted with an energy spectrum more thermalized relative to prompt neutrons. For low enriched uranium fuel working on a thermal neutron spectrum, the difference between the average and effective delayed neutron fractions can reach 50 pcm (1 pcm = 1e-5).

<text>The Statue of Liberty is a trick play in American football named after, and resembling, the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;).

==Execution of the play==
Although many variations of the play exist, the most common involves the quarterback taking the snap from the center, dropping back, and gripping the ball with two hands as if he were to throw. He then places the ball behind his back with his non-throwing hand, while pretending to throw to one side of the field with his other hand. While his arm is still in motion during the fake throw, he hands the ball off behind his back to a running back or a wide receiver in motion, who runs the football to the opposite side of the field. The objective is to trick the defense out of position, leaving them unable to catch up with the runner as he moves in the direction opposite to the fake.

The play is named after the positioning of the quarterback as he hands the ball off. If done correctly, he should have one hand in the air and the other at his side, resembling the pose of the Statue of Liberty. When executed properly, the Statue of Liberty is a deceptive and high-yardage play. However, the coordination of motions required is difficult, and failure may lead to a fumble, sack, or lost yardage. Additionally, disciplined defenses may be able to spot the fake.

==History of the play==
Amos Alonzo Stagg was the first to call the play, and Stagg credited Clarence Herschberger with being the first player to run the play. The play was made popular by Fielding H. Yost during his tenure as head coach of the football team at the University of Michigan.

This play was also a part of the offensive repertoire of the NFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams teams of the mid-1970s under coach Chuck Knox.

===Notable examples===
The Northwestern Wildcats employed a direct-snap variant of this play in the 1949 Rose Bowl to run for a 45-yard touchdown in the final minutes of the game, defeating the heavily favored California Golden Bears, 20–14.

The Baltimore Colts ran a version of the play in December 1970. Led by 37-year-old quarterback Johnny Unitas, the Colts beat the Oakland Raiders in the 1970 AFC Championship game, 27–17.

In a regular-season matchup against the Michigan Wolverines in 2007, Oregon Ducks quarterback Dennis Dixon faked a Statue of Liberty to running back Jonathan Stewart (somewhat like a bootleg) and then ran for a touchdown almost unseen.

The 2007 Fiesta Bowl featured a widely reported and frequently replayed use of the play, executed by Jared Zabransky and Ian Johnson of the Boise State Broncos against the Oklahoma Sooners. The play, known as &quot;Statue Left&quot; by the Broncos and run from a trips shotgun set, clinched Boise State a two-point conversion for the overtime victory. This bowl game is referred to as one of the closest and most exciting college football games of all time, due in part to the do-or-die nature of this play.

Oklahoma saw another Statue of Liberty play in their September 6, 2008, game against the Cincinnati Bearcats. Bearcats quarterback Dustin Grutza handed off to John Goebel, but the Sooners stopped Goebel for only a short gain.

Boise State executed the same play described above nearly eight years later—once against the Wyoming Cowboys, and also while facing the Arizona Wildcats in the Fiesta Bowl. Both plays resulted in touchdowns for Jay Ajayi.

The New England Patriots employed an unusual variant of the play in their 2007 NFL divisional playoff game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Strictly speaking, the play, which the Patriots called &quot;Double Pop,&quot; was actually a reverse Statue of Liberty play, in that the run, not the pass, was the fake element. Center Dan Koppen faked a direct snap to Patriots running back Kevin Faulk, causing the defense to move to stop the run; meanwhile, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who received the football, faked an over-the-head snap, and held the Statue of Liberty pose with his back to the defense before turning around and throwing a touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker in the back of the end zone.

In the 2023 NFL Wildcard playoff round, the New York Giants used a Statue of Liberty play in their 31–24 victory against the Minnesota Vikings.

==In popular culture==
The execution of the Statue of Liberty play was detailed in &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; television series in the 1973 episode &quot;QuarterBack Sneak&quot;.

In the 1995 &quot;Simpsons&quot; Halloween episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot; during Bart&#x27;s dream of winning the Super Bowl, Krusty the Clown calls the play but alters its design to a normal forward pass.

<doc id="1221457" wikidata="Q3044545" url="?curid=1221457" title="Delayed neutron">
<text>In nuclear engineering, a delayed neutron is a neutron emitted after a nuclear fission event, by one of the fission products (or actually, a fission product daughter after beta decay), any time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes after the fission event. Neutrons born within 10−14 seconds of the fission are termed &quot;prompt neutrons&quot;.

In a nuclear reactor large nuclides fission into two neutron-rich fission products (i.e. unstable nuclides) and free neutrons (prompt neutrons). Many of these fission products then undergo radioactive decay (usually beta decay) and the resulting nuclides are unstable with respect to beta decay. A small fraction of them are excited enough to be able to beta-decay by emitting a delayed neutron in addition to the beta. The moment of beta decay of the precursor nuclides – which are the precursors of the delayed neutrons – happens orders of magnitude later compared to the emission of the prompt neutrons. Hence the neutron that originates from the precursor&#x27;s decay is termed a delayed neutron. The &quot;delay&quot; in the neutron emission is due to the delay in beta decay (which is slower since controlled by the weak force), since neutron emission, like gamma emission, is controlled by the strong nuclear force and thus either happens at fission, or nearly simultaneously with the beta decay, immediately after it. The various half lives of these decays that finally result in neutron emission, are thus the beta decay half lives of the precursor radionuclides.

Delayed neutrons play an important role in nuclear reactor control and safety analysis.

==Principle==
Delayed neutrons are associated with the beta decay of the fission products. After prompt fission neutron emission the residual fragments are still neutron rich and undergo a beta decay chain. The more neutron rich the fragment, the more energetic and faster the beta decay. In some cases the available energy in the beta decay is high enough to leave the residual nucleus in such a highly excited state that neutron emission instead of gamma emission occurs.

Using U-235 as an example, this nucleus absorbs thermal neutrons, and the immediate mass products of a fission event are two large fission fragments, which are remnants of the formed U-236 nucleus. These fragments emit, on average, two or three free neutrons (in average 2.47), called &quot;prompt&quot; neutrons. A subsequent fission fragment occasionally undergoes a stage of radioactive decay (which is a beta minus decay) that yields a new nucleus (the emitter nucleus) in an excited state that emits an additional neutron, called a &quot;delayed&quot; neutron, to get to ground state. These neutron-emitting fission fragments are called delayed neutron precursor atoms.

Delayed Neutron Data for Thermal Fission in U-235

==Importance in nuclear reactors==

If a nuclear reactor happened to be prompt critical – even very slightly – the number of neutrons would increase exponentially at a high rate, and very quickly the reactor would become uncontrollable by means of external mechanisms. The control of the power rise would then be left to its intrinsic physical stability factors, like the thermal dilatation of the core, or the increased resonance absorptions of neutrons, that usually tend to decrease the reactor&#x27;s reactivity when temperature rises; but the reactor would run the risk of being damaged or destroyed by heat.

However, thanks to the delayed neutrons, it is possible to leave the reactor in a subcritical state as far as only prompt neutrons are concerned: the delayed neutrons come a moment later, just in time to sustain the chain reaction when it is going to die out. In that regime, neutron production overall still grows exponentially, but on a time scale that is governed by the delayed neutron production, which is slow enough to be controlled (just as an otherwise unstable bicycle can be balanced because human reflexes are quick enough on the time scale of its instability). Thus, by widening the margins of non-operation and supercriticality and allowing more time to regulate the reactor, the delayed neutrons are essential to inherent reactor safety, even in reactors requiring active control.

The lower percentage of delayed neutrons makes the use of large percentages of plutonium in nuclear reactors more challenging.

==Fraction definitions==

The precursor yield fraction β is defined as:

:formula_1

and it is equal to 0.0064 for U-235.

The delayed neutron fraction (DNF) is defined as:

:formula_2

These two factors, β and &quot;DNF&quot;, are almost the same thing, but not quite; they differ in the case a rapid (faster than the decay time of the precursor atoms) change in the number of neutrons in the reactor.

Another concept, is the &quot;effective fraction of delayed neutrons&quot; βeff, which is the fraction of delayed neutrons weighted (over space, energy, and angle) on the adjoint neutron flux. This concept arises because delayed neutrons are emitted with an energy spectrum more thermalized relative to prompt neutrons. For low enriched uranium fuel working on a thermal neutron spectrum, the difference between the average and effective delayed neutron fractions can reach 50 pcm.

The purpose is to build character, help strengthen police-community relations, and keep children off illegal drugs.

Most PAL programs now call themselves &quot;Police Activities Leagues&quot; because many of the programs are now focused on youth enrichment, educational and youth leadership programs and not just sports. Some organizations are also called Sheriff Activities Leagues (SAL) because their sponsoring agency is a Sheriff&#x27;s Department. 

According to local Police Athletic Leagues, the program generally solicits funds, equipment, and volunteer help from members of the community, so that the cost to taxpayers is small while the returns are great. Participants in the League&#x27;s activities are supposedly much less likely to engage in crime, far more likely to praise the character of the police force, and discourage their friends from either committing crimes or covering up criminal activity.

Police Athletic League programs usually have a competitive component. Although the vast majority of the League&#x27;s contests are with other youths in the same city, there are regularly scheduled national contests between teams in different parts of the country. For many of the young people who participate, it is their first chance to travel to where the contests are held.

The Police Athletic League provides participation in many sports. These include Soccer, Basketball, Football, and many other sports throughout the U.S.

The National Association of Police Athletics/Activities Leagues, Inc. is based in Washington, DC.

<text>Debbie Jaramillo (born 1952) is an American politician who served as the 39th mayor of Santa Fe, New Mexico from 1994 to 1998.

==Career==

=== Mayor of Santa Fe ===
Jaramillo was elected mayor after serving six years on the city council. She was Santa Fe&#x27;s first female mayor. As a city councilor, she had expressed concern about the gentrification of Santa Fe, which was forcing the primarily Hispanic local population to move out of its historical neighborhoods: &quot;We painted our downtown brown and moved the brown people out&quot;, she said in 1991. She ran on a platform promising to place the interests of local residents above those of Santa Fe&#x27;s booming tourist industry, in contrast to the more pro-development policies of the incumbent mayor, Sam Pick. Her campaign slogans included &quot;Take back Santa Fe!&quot;, and in her victory speech she said, &quot;This town is not for sale. It belongs to the community.&quot;

Jaramillo had previously run against Pick for mayor, unsuccessfully, and her 1994 election was viewed as an upset, since she had been outspent by her opponents and she had trailed in pre-election polls.

==== Tenure ====
Jaramillo&#x27;s administration was marked by controversy. She pushed through a plan for the city, assisted by The Trust for Public Land, to acquire the Santa Fe Railyard property and begin its conversion into a public mixed-use development.
A new police chief, Donald Grady, was hired in an effort to modernize and bring a community policing philosophy to the Santa Fe Police Department, whose previous chief had been a target of Jaramillo&#x27;s criticism. However, Grady&#x27;s efforts met strong opposition and he resigned in 1996. Grady was replaced by Jaramillo&#x27;s brother-in-law. Since Jaramillo&#x27;s brother, Ike Pino, was already the city manager, this appointment led to charges of nepotism, although Jaramillo defended her relatives, pointing out that Santa Fe had &quot;always been a community that was related to one another.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Pino was removed from his city manager position by the city council.

In 1998, Jaramillo lost her re-election bid by a decisive margin. The winner, Larry Delgado, was viewed as taking a centrist position between the anti-development policies of Jaramillo and the pro-development policies of Sam Pick, who was also running for mayor again. Jaramillo received 11% of the vote, behind Delgado&#x27;s 44% and Pick&#x27;s 32%.

In 1999, Christine Marie Sierra, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico, produced a documentary about Jaramillo&#x27;s election, entitled &quot;This Town Is Not For Sale!: The 1994 Santa Fe Mayoral Election&quot;.

<doc id="1221464" wikidata="Q1063812" url="?curid=1221464" title="Shinedown">
<text>Shinedown is an American rock band from Jacksonville, Florida, formed by singer Brent Smith in 2001 after the dissolution of his previous band, Dreve. Smith, still under contract with record label Atlantic Records, recruited the band&#x27;s original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, Brad Stewart on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, several lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch alongside Zach Myers on guitar and Eric Bass on bass. The group has released seven studio albums: &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot; (2003), &quot;Us and Them&quot; (2005), &quot;The Sound of Madness&quot; (2008), &quot;Amaryllis&quot; (2012), &quot;Threat to Survival&quot; (2015), &quot;Attention Attention&quot; (2018), and &quot;Planet Zero&quot; (2022).

Shinedown has the most number one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock charts with 19, and all of their released singles have reached the top five on the chart. Additionally, on June 3, 2021, Shinedown was ranked number one by &quot;Billboard&quot; on the Greatest of All Time Mainstreams Rock Artists chart released to celebrate the Mainstream Rock chart&#x27;s 40th anniversary. To date, the band has sold more than 10 million records worldwide.

==History==
===2000–2004: Formation and &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot;===
The band&#x27;s origins trace back to frontman Brent Smith&#x27;s prior band, Dreve, which had signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in 2000. The record label, unhappy with Dreve as a whole, dropped the band prior to releasing an album, but retained Smith, who they felt was worth developing separately as an artist. Atlantic signed Smith to a development deal where record representatives helped him with his song writing ability, and helped him recruit members for a new band, which would become Shinedown. Smith moved to Jacksonville, Florida and began work on the project in 2001. The first member he recruited was bassist Brad Stewart, through local Jacksonville music producer Pete Thornton. Smith and Stewart began recording demos together in a small local studio, whose owner recommended they meet with her fiancé, guitarist Jasin Todd, who Smith brought in as the third member. The original lineup was rounded out by drummer Barry Kerch, who was the seventh drummer the band had auditioned for the spot. The four worked together on creating demos, and submitted their work-in-progress material to Atlantic, who approved of the material and green-lighted a full-length album.

The resulting work was the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot;, which was released May 27, 2003. While not an immediate success, through the extensive touring and successful singles, eventually certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, indicating sales of over 1 million. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Fly from the Inside&quot;, &quot;45&quot;, a cover of the Lynyrd Skynyrd song &quot;Simple Man&quot;, and &quot;Burning Bright&quot;. All four singles charted in the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock charts, peaking at fifth, third, fifth, and second, respectively. The band toured extensively in support of the album, playing over 400 live shows over the course of 2003 and 2004. The band ended up touring for 24 months straight, doing various tours with Van Halen, Seether, and Three Doors Down. The band later released a live DVD titled &quot;Live from the Inside&quot; that documented the live shows of the touring cycle.

===2005–2006: &quot;Us and Them&quot;===
The band did not start work on a follow-up album until 2005, with the band finding the touring lifestyle too hectic to start writing or recording material. This, however, left the band with limited time to record new music, with their record label pressuring the band to get the album out in a six-month time period. Despite the time restrictions, the label did not pressure the band on the album&#x27;s musical direction after the commercial success of &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot;. The band worked with music producer Tony Battaglia, and chose to go in a more &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;stripped down&quot; direction for the album&#x27;s sound, Kerch describing it as just &quot;pure rock.&quot; During the same time, the band was also approached by Hollywood Records to record a song for a tribute album for the band Queen, something the band agreed to out of their respect for the band. They recorded a cover of the track &quot;Tie Your Mother Down,&quot; which was released on &quot;Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen&quot; (2005).

The band released their second studio album, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, on October 4, 2005. The album debuted higher than &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, peaking at number 23 versus &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot;&#x27;s number 53 peak, but the album ultimately sold less than its predecessor. Despite this, the band&#x27;s three singles from the album, &quot;Save Me&quot;, &quot;I Dare You&quot;, and &quot;Heroes&quot; ended up being more successful than their prior album&#x27;s singles. The lead single, &quot;Save Me&quot; was the band&#x27;s first to reach the number one spot on the Mainstream Rock Charts, and held the position for twelve weeks in a row. The second single, &quot;I Dare You&quot;, also peaked at number 2 on the same chart. Notably, both songs were also the band&#x27;s first to have crossover success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts, hitting 72 and 88 respectively.

The band again toured heavily in support of the album, including the 2006 iteration of the SnoCore Tour with Seether, Flyleaf, and Halestorm, and later opening for Godsmack and Rob Zombie co-headlining tour of North America. Promotional support came from other areas as well; then-&quot;American Idol&quot; contestant Chris Daughtry performed &quot;I Dare You&quot; live on the show, helping its crossover appeal, and was used as a theme song for WrestleMania 22. The success of the singles helped propel sales of the album in the long run, ultimately being certified platinum by the RIAA on March 19, 2018, signifying 1 million album sales.

===2007–2010: &quot;The Sound of Madness&quot;===
Work on a third studio album began in early 2007. While the record label requested an album to be created in six months, Smith declined, stating that he was not happy with the results of working under the time restraints on the last album, and wished to take his time on the album. The label agreed to this, ultimately allowing Smith to take 18 months to prep the album. Part of the long development time was due to internal issues within band members; during this time, Smith fired both Stewart and Todd from the band. Smith let Stewart go due to disagreements with the direction of the band, feeling that Stewart was no longer happy or committed to the band. Todd was fired due to major disagreements with Smith, and personal problems that were getting in the way of the band. Then-touring guitarist, Zach Myers, later recounted that both Smith and Todd were going through significant substance abuse issues at the time with drugs and alcohol, which lead to much infighting between the two. The band almost broke up during the period, but Smith firing Todd and stopping his drug use helped eliminate the internal issues, and helped the band move forward.

Smith spent much of 2007 writing new material with Rick Beato of Black Dog Sound Recording Studios in Stone Mountain, GA, for the third album. Sessions were prolific, with Smith writing over 60 songs during the period, though that he now lacked a guitarist and bassist was a constant concern. Smith recruited a number of studio musicians for its recording sessions; Dave Barrett contributed most of the album&#x27;s guitars, Tim Pierce contributed some additional guitar, and Chris Chaney contributed most of the album&#x27;s bass guitar. The rough demos were sent from the record label to music producer Rob Cavallo, who, upon hearing them, told Smith he wanted to produce the album.

The final result, &quot;The Sound of Madness&quot;, was released on June 24, 2008. It debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top album charts, selling 50,000 copies in its opening week. In order to start touring in support of the album, Smith assembled a new official lineup for the band, consisting of Nick Perri of Silvertide on lead guitar, Eric Bass on bass guitar, and upgrading touring member, Zach Myers to a permanent rhythm guitarist position. Perri toured only briefly with the band in 2008, before leaving to pursue a solo career, a move Smith was fine with, as he felt the band operated better as a quartet, leaving Myers as the primary guitarist.

Through multiple successful single releases, and extensive touring, the album ended up being the band&#x27;s best-selling, staying on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts for 120 consecutive weeks, and eventually being certified double platinum in the United States, indicating two million units sold. Six singles were released from the album: &quot;Devour&quot;, &quot;Second Chance&quot;, &quot;Sound of Madness&quot;, &quot;If You Only Knew&quot;, &quot;The Crow &amp; the Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;Diamond Eyes (Boom-Lay Boom-Lay Boom)&quot;; each one topping a Billboard rock music chart. Of particular note was &quot;Second Chance&quot;, which crossed over to the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 7, and eventually being certified triple platinum, indicating three million units of the single sold.

The band, with its new lineup, once again toured extensively in support of the album release, spending over two years on live performances. Of note, the band headlined the &quot;Carnival of Madness&quot; tour, which involved larger, 10,000 capacity arena venues, and a later &quot;Anything and Everything Tour,&quot; which involved acoustic performances in smaller venues and Q&amp;A (question and answer) sessions with the crowd. &quot;Somewhere in the Stratosphere&quot;, a live album/DVD, was released in May 2011, documenting performances from both tours.

===2011–2014: &quot;Amaryllis&quot;===

Work on a fourth studio album began in February 2011, with the band spending the first half of the year writing and demoing over 33 songs. The band again decided to work with Cavallo as a producer, but moved into a new sound and lyrical direction on the album, capturing a more of a message of &quot;empowerment, perseverance, and inspiration&quot;, inspired by Smith&#x27;s then-recent change of getting sober and living a healthier lifestyle, and the new band members contributing to the writing process for the first time on an album. The recording process wrapped up about a year later in February 2012, and the album, &quot;Amaryllis,&quot; was released the next month, on March 27, 2012, in 30 countries simultaneously, through a joint release between Atlantic and Roadrunner Records in countries Atlantic did not distribute into. &quot;Amaryllis&quot; debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; charts, selling 106,000 copies in its opening week. While the opening sales doubled the debut of &quot;The Sound of Madness&quot;, overall sales fell well short, with the album only being certified Gold, indicating a half million copies sold.

Five singles were released from the album: &quot;Bully&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot;, &quot;Enemies&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow You&quot;, and &quot;Adrenaline&quot;. The band&#x27;s singles once again fared well, albeit it slightly below &quot;The Sound of Madness&quot; singles; &quot;Bully&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Charts, &quot;Enemies&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow You&quot; peaked at number 2, and &quot;Adrenaline&quot; peaked at number 4. Additionally, only &quot;Bully&quot; managed to have any cross-over success, breaking into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart at number 94 and eventually being certified Gold as well. Shinedown also contributed the non-album song titled &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; to the soundtrack of the 2012 film &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

In November 2012, Smith announced in an NME interview that a follow up Shinedown album had already been recorded. Smith stated &quot;We have another record of material. It&#x27;s actually recorded...It&#x27;s still very massive, it still has an epic feel to it all, but the tempo is a little slower, and the subject matter is a little different. I would say it&#x27;s actually a bit darker, a little bit more mischievous.&quot; Despite the announcement, the band proceeded to continue on with the &quot;Amaryllis&quot; touring cycle, touring through 2013 to complete another two year touring cycle. Shinedown and Three Days Grace embarked on a co-headlined tour beginning in February 2013, and went on another iteration of the yearly &quot;Carnival of Madness&quot; tour with Papa Roach in later 2013.

In April 2013, Smith and Myers recorded ten acoustic cover songs, selected out of a pool of over 4,000 fan requests, selecting a variety of different types of songs, from Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; to Adele&#x27;s &quot;Someone Like You&quot;. The tracks were released across two separate EPs, &quot;Acoustic Sessions&quot; on January 28, 2014, and &quot;Acoustic Sessions Pt. 2&quot; on March 28, 2014, with performance videos created for every track on the first EP. The band took much of 2014 off, a rarity for the band, which had pretty consistently moved back and forth between recording and touring for each album cycle. The time off was for the band to rest, specifically Smith, who had damaged his vocal cords and contracted oral thrush from the constant years of touring prior.

===2015–2016: &quot;Threat to Survival&quot;===

Recording for the band&#x27;s fifth studio album began in January 2015, with a goal of a July or August release date. The band later embarked on a summer headlining tour with Nothing More. The first single from the album, &quot;Cut the Cord&quot; was released in June 2015, ahead of the album&#x27;s release. Two more promotional songs were released in August as well, &quot;Black Cadillac&quot; and &quot;State of My Head&quot;.

In August 2015, the band announced the name of the album, &quot;Threat to Survival&quot;, and its release date of September 18, 2015. The album debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 65,000 in the first week, lower than their prior album, &quot;Amaryllis.&quot; Despite the drop in sales, the band still found success in their singles. Four singles were released from the album, and three of the four singles - &quot;Cut the Cord,&quot;, &quot;State of My Head&quot;, and &quot;How Did You Love&quot; hit number one on the US Mainstream Rock charts, while the other, &quot;Asking for It&quot;, peaked at number two. After the album&#x27;s release, they embarked on a co-headlining US tour with Breaking Benjamin that would take place between October and November 2015. The tour went on to gross a total of $5.7 million. 

The band continued touring in 2016, headlining U.S. dates with The Virginmarys. The group appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot; in April 2016, and, the following month, they performed at several festivals including the Fort Rock Festival and Rock&#x27;N Derby. The band also headlined the 2016 version of the Carnival of Madness tour with Halestorm in July and August. Later in 2016, the band went on a fall U.S. arena tour with Sixx AM and Five Finger Death Punch that was extended into December.

===2017–2020: &quot;Attention Attention&quot;===
In February 2017, Smith announced that they had begun work on a sixth studio album. Bass had been working on writing 22 separate pieces of music over the course of their 2016 touring, separate from the rest of the band, who wanted to just concentrate on touring. Bass had just begun presenting the material to Smith, who, while unsure how much exactly would go into the future album, did say that he was very impressed, and that the material may fit together into a concept album, a first for the band. They joined Iron Maiden on tour in Europe in April and May, and began recording soon after. At the time, the band planned to finish the album in late 2017, release a first single in January 2018, and then release the album in April. In January 2018, Myers announced that the band had finished recording the album, and that Bass was working on finalizing the production and mixing of the album. Myers also described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;heavier than &quot;Threat to Survival&quot;.&quot;

On March 7, 2018, the band announced the album&#x27;s title, &quot;Attention Attention&quot;, and released its first single, &quot;Devil&quot;. &quot;Devil&quot; would eventually reach number 1 on the Active Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. &quot;Attention Attention&quot; was released on May 4, 2018, and was Shinedown&#x27;s first album to be produced and mixed entirely by a member of the band (Eric Bass). The album debuted at number 1 on the Top Rock Albums, Hard Rock Albums, and Alternative Albums charts. It was the second time the band had achieved that feat (&quot;Amaryllis&quot; also topped all three charts). It has thus far peaked at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 61,000 units in the process. On April 5, a second song, &quot;The Human Radio&quot; was released as a promotional single, accompanied by a music video.

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the band went on a brief co-headlining tour with Five Finger Death Punch. They also released a 14-minute behind the scenes documentary video about the making of &quot;Attention Attention&quot;. The band embarked on a summer co-headlining tour with Godsmack that began in July 2018.

In October 2018, Shinedown announced plans to headline a U.S. tour beginning February 20, 2019, in Estero, Florida. Supporting acts for the trek included Papa Roach and Asking Alexandria. The tour concluded on March 20, 2019, in Loveland, CO.

In November 2018, Shinedown regained sole possession of the most top 10 chart placements in the history of Billboard&#x27;s Rock Airplay chart, with &quot;Get Up&quot; the second single from &quot;Attention Attention&quot;. The song earned 5.9 million rock radio audience impressions, a boost of 5 percent, in the week ending Nov. 18, according to Nielsen Music. On March 1, 2019, the band released the song &quot;Monsters&quot; as the third single from &quot;Attention Attention&quot; and was followed by a music video. On July 2, 2019, an animated video for the song was also released. On September 24, 2019, the band released the song &quot;Attention Attention&quot; as the fourth single from &quot;Attention Attention&quot; and was followed by a music video.

On March 23, 2020, the band released a previously unreleased song recorded for &quot;Amaryllis&quot; titled &quot;Atlas Falls&quot;, to raise money for Direct Relief to provide equipment for frontline workers during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The song was available to download with the purchase of a T-shirt. The band donated $20,000 themselves, and raised over $70,000 in the first 36 hours. On May 22, after raising over $300,000, &quot;Atlas Falls&quot; was officially released to streaming services and digital retailers. On the June 27 tally, &quot;Atlas Falls&quot; became Shinedown&#x27;s 27th top 10 single on the Mainstream Rock Chart. Only Tom Petty has more, with 28.

On May 26, 2020, the band announced that they had postponed all of their 2020 summer Deep Dive tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many dates being rescheduled.

===2021–2024: &quot;Planet Zero&quot;===

In February 2021, Smith announced that the band had started working on a seventh studio album, with the goal of releasing it in the second half of 2021. The band released a film for their sixth album, &quot;Attention Attention&quot;. The film was directed by Bill Yukich and was released on September 3, 2021. On August 28, 2021, Smith announced the band&#x27;s first single off the upcoming album is expected to be out in January 2022, with the album following a few months later.
On January 26, 2022, the band released the lead single, &quot;Planet Zero&quot;, from their seventh studio album of the same name. The album was originally set to be released on April 22, 2022. On March 25, 2022, the band released a second song, &quot;The Saints of Violence and Innuendo&quot;. On April 12, 2022, the band announced that the album&#x27;s release was being pushed back to July 1, 2022. The change was due to a delay in vinyl production, and the band&#x27;s desire for the fanbase to experience the album simultaneously across formats. In April 2022, the band was inducted into &quot;Mohegan Sun&#x27;s Walk Of Fame&quot;. On June 1, 2022, the band released the second single, &quot;Daylight&quot;. After the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot; was released as the third single on January 17, 2023, and then &quot;A Symptom of Being Human&quot; as the fourth on February 22, 2023. &quot;A Symptom of Being Human&quot; was the first Shinedown single since their debut to initially not be released to rock radio, instead debuting on Hot Adult Contemporary radio and crossing to rock radio later on. A &quot;Pop Remix&quot; of the song was released on June 23, 2023.

In May 2024 the band launched a signature hot sauce line, with each of the three sauces named after a different song, the first being the &quot;Symptom Chipotle Garlic Sauce&quot; (named after their 2023 single &quot;A Symptom of Being Human&quot;), followed by &quot;Devour Pineapple Jerk Sauce&quot; (after their 2008 single, &quot;Devour&quot;), and &quot;Attention Attention Mango Habanero Sauce&quot; (after their 2019 single, &quot;Attention Attention&quot;).

===2025–present: Upcoming eighth studio album===
In February 2024, Smith announced that the band was working on its eighth studio album. Throughout 2024, both Kerch and Bass shared details about the upcoming album, the process leading to its production, the musical style and the fact that unlike the previous two albums, the next one will not be a concept album.

On January 24, 2025, the band released two singles, &quot;Three Six Five&quot; and &quot;Dance, Kid, Dance&quot; from their upcoming eighth album.

==Musical style and influences==
Shinedown&#x27;s music has been described as hard rock, alternative metal, post-grunge, alternative rock, pop rock, grunge, arena rock, and nu metal, with pop and Southern rock influences. In August 2013, Kerch disagreed with more specialized genre ascribed to the band, stating that &quot;We&#x27;re just a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band&quot; while conceding that each album did have a markedly different rock sound to them by design. The nu metal label has been applied to the band&#x27;s earlier work by journalists on occasion, though the band disputes that term as well. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Leave a Whisper&quot;, largely stayed away from having any guitar solos, something then-guitarist Todd felt was undesirable due to the popularity of nu metal at the time of recording the album, though he felt the band was never particularly part of the genre&#x27;s movement. With nu metal falling out of popularity by the mid-2000s, they began adding guitar solos more prominently to their music, starting with their next album, &quot;Us and Them&quot;. &quot;Us and Them&quot; has also been described as less &quot;grungy&quot; than its predecessor with &quot;more twisted, progressive song structures&quot;.

&quot;The Sound of Madness&quot; went in different musical and lyrical directions as compared to the band&#x27;s previous two albums. Barry Kerch noted that lineup changes and volatility in the band members&#x27; lives produced a darker and angrier sound. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Devour&quot;, is an anti-war anthem, but &quot;The Sound of Madness&quot; also contains &quot;If You Only Knew&quot;, the band&#x27;s first love ballad. &quot;Amaryllis&quot; has been noted to have a more positive, &quot;anthemic&quot; bent. Writing for &quot;Loudwire&quot;, Anne Erickson described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;aggressive-yet-cathartic.&quot; Their fifth studio album, &quot;Threat to Survival&quot;, was described as the band&#x27;s most &quot;pop-oriented&quot; album, with the single &quot;State of My Head&quot; being referred to as &quot;a slick amalgam of electro-pop and vintage alt-rock with a catchy as hell though extremely well-worn chorus.&quot; The 2018 follow-up, &quot;Attention Attention&quot;, is a concept album that begins with the narrator in a &quot;dark, negative place&quot; and gradually emerging from that over the course of the track listing. Both &quot;Threat to Survival&quot; and &quot;Attention Attention&quot; have been described as having more of a pop rock sound but have also been described as hard rock.

The band has cited Stone Temple Pilots, Otis Redding, Pink Floyd, and Iron Maiden as influences. Primary songwriter, Brent Smith, has also cited Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, The Doors, Soundgarden, and Metallica as some of his influences.

<text>Blockhouse Bay is a residential suburb in the south west of Auckland, in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is sited on the northern coast of the Manukau Harbour, and is also close to the administrative boundary that existed between Auckland City and Waitakere City, two of the former four cities of what was the Auckland conurbation before amalgamation into Auckland Council.

The suburb is located 11 kilometres to the southwest of the city centre, and is surrounded by the more central suburbs of Lynfield and New Windsor, and the Waitakere suburbs of New Lynn and Green Bay.

The Blockhouse Bay Library is located in the town centre, as is the Blockhouse Bay Community Centre, located 200 metres from the library.

==Etymology==
Blockhouse Bay had its current name officially adopted in 1948. Earlier it was known by the name Avondale South and before that it was considered part of Waikomiti. The name is derived from the block houses that were constructed on the site during the New Zealand Wars.

==History==
===Early history===
Portage Road is the location of Te Tōanga Waka, one of the overland routes between the two harbours (and thus the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman Sea), where Māori would beach their waka (canoes) and drag them overland to the other coast, thus avoiding having to paddle around North Cape. This made the area of immense strategic importance in both pre-European times and during the early years of European occupation.

The earliest European known to have trekked through, and followed the coastline of the Manukau Harbour in an endeavour to find if there was a waterway connecting the two harbours, was the Rev. Samuel Marsden in 1820. Two missionaries who had arrived in New Zealand on 30 December 1834, William Colenso and R. Wade, walked through the Whau South area in 1838 hoping to find a Māori settlement, but the pā site on Te Whau point had been abandoned some time before. They remarked that the area was &quot;open and barren heaths, dreary, sterile and wild.&quot;

Te Whau Bay was used as a camping spot for European settlers during the early colonial era of Auckland.

===The Blockhouse===

A wooden blockhouse was constructed over Te Whau Bay in 1860. At this time the first land war in Taranaki was escalating and there were fears it would spread north and so a defence system for Auckland was actioned. A 12-acre site was chosen, bordered by Esplanade (Endeavour Street), Gilfillan Street, Wynyard Road (Blockhouse Bay Road) and Boylan Street (Wade Street). The actual Whau Blockhouse was located on what is now No. 8 Gilfillan Street.

The site was chosen for two reasons:
* The elevated cleared site provided an unobstructed view towards the Manukau Heads, the source of possible attack from southern Māori tribes.
* It was close to the Whau Portage which was the route favoured by northern Māori tribes.

Colonel Thomas Mould of the Royal Engineers was charged with planning the location and type of defence system needed. A blockhouse is a purpose-built building with walls thick enough to stop musket ball penetration, with slits in the walls for defensive musket fire, a fence or stockade surrounding the building, with a trench beyond that.

The blockhouse was manned by the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot and the 65th (2nd Yorkshire, North Riding) Regiment of Foot until 1863. Never seeing military action, the blockhouse was rented out to a tenant in the 1880s and was gutted in a fire. It was subsequently demolished. The trenches were apparently still visible in the 1940s but have since been obscured.

===Urban development===

The earliest industry, in 1884, was the Gittos Tannery. The early 1900s saw other industries such as poultry, orchards, potteries, strawberries, flowers, loganberries and small farm holdings.

A bach community at Blockhouse Bay developed in the early 1900s, with the area becoming a popular holiday resort for Aucklanders in the 1920s, with families making the journey over rough roads to spend the summer at the beach. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, workers developed the Blockhouse Bay beachfront area, building stone walls and pathways.

<doc id="1221466" wikidata="Q1136979" url="?curid=1221466" title="Coulometry">
<text>In analytical electrochemistry, coulometry is the measure of charge (coulombs) transfer during an electrochemical redox reaction. It can be used for precision measurements of charge, but coulometry is mainly used for analytical applications to determine the amount of matter transformed. 

There are two main categories of coulometric techniques. Amperostatic coulometry, or coulometric titration keeps the current constant using an amperostat. Potentiostatic coulometry holds the electric potential constant during the reaction using a potentiostat.

== History ==
The term coulometry was introduced in 1938 by Hungarian chemist László Szebellédy and Zoltan Somogyi. Coulometry is the measure of charge, thus named after its unit the coulomb.

Michael Faraday, known for his work in electricity and magnetism, made critical contributions to the field of electrochemistry. He discovered the laws of electrolysis, and in his recognition is the eponym of the Faraday constant. In the earliest developments of coulometry, Faraday proposed the first instrument to measure charge by utilizing the electrolysis of water. 

Surface coulometry, the method of determining metallic layers or oxide films on metals, was first applied by American Chemist G. G. Grower in 1917 by checking the quality of tinned copper wire. 

Coulometric methods were used widely in the middle of the twentieth century but voltammetric methods and non-electrochemical analytical methods took over decreasing the use for coulometry, but one method widely used today is the Karl Fischer method.
==Potentiostatic coulometry==

Potentiostatic coulometry utilizes a constant electric potential and is a technique most commonly referred to as &quot;bulk electrolysis&quot;. Also called direct coulometry, the analyte is oxidized or reduced at the working electrode without intermediate reactions. The working electrode is kept at a constant potential and the current that flows through the circuit is measured. This constant potential is applied long enough to fully reduce or oxidize all of the electroactive species in a given solution. As the electroactive molecules are consumed, the current also decreases, approaching zero when the conversion is complete. The sample mass, molecular mass, number of electrons in the electrode reaction, and number of electrons passed during the experiment are all related by Faraday&#x27;s laws. It follows that, if three of the values are known, then the fourth can be calculated.

Bulk electrolysis is often used to unambiguously assign the number of electrons consumed in a reaction observed through voltammetry. It also has the added benefit of producing a solution of a species (oxidation state) which may not be accessible through chemical routes. This species can then be isolated or further characterized while in solution.

The rate of such reactions is not determined by the concentration of the solution, but rather the mass transfer of the electroactive species in the solution to the electrode surface. Rates will increase when the volume of the solution is decreased, the solution is stirred more rapidly, or the area of the working electrode is increased. Since mass transfer is so important the solution is stirred during a bulk electrolysis. However, this technique is generally not considered a hydrodynamic technique, since a laminar flow of solution against the electrode is neither the objective nor outcome of the stirring.

The extent to which a reaction goes to completion is also related to how much greater the applied potential is than the reduction potential of interest. In the case where multiple reduction potentials are of interest, it is often difficult to set an electrolysis potential a &quot;safe&quot; distance (such as 200 mV) past a redox event. The result is incomplete conversion of the substrate, or else conversion of some of the substrate to the more reduced form. This factor must be considered when analyzing the current passed and when attempting to do further analysis/isolation/experiments with the substrate solution.

An advantage to this kind of analysis over electrogravimetry is that it does not require that the product of the reaction be weighed. This is useful for reactions where the product does not deposit as a solid, such as the determination of the amount of arsenic in a sample from the electrolysis of arsenous acid (H3AsO3) to arsenic acid (H3AsO4).

==Coulometric titration==

Coulometric titrations under a constant current system quantifies the to analyte by measuring the duration that current passes through the sample. In indirect or secondary coulometry, the working electrode produces a titrant that reacts with the analyte. When the analyte is completely consumed, endpoint detection is employed, preferably with an instrumental method for higher precision. The total charge that has flowed through the sample can be determined from the magnitude of the current (in amperes) and the duration of the current (in seconds). Using Faraday&#x27;s Law, total charge can be used to determine the moles of the unknown species in solution. When the volume of the solution is known, the molarity of the unknown species can be determined.

Advantages of Coulometric Titration

Coulometric titration has the advantage that constant current sources for the generation of titrants are relatively easy to make. 
* The electrochemical generation of a titrant is much more sensitive and can be much more accurately controlled than the mechanical addition of titrant using a burette drive. For example, a constant current flow of 10 μA for 100 ms is easily generated and corresponds to about 10 micrograms of titrant. 
* The preparation of standard solutions and titer determination is no longer necessary.
* Chemical substances that are unstable or difficult to handle because of their high volatility or reactivity in solution can also very easily be used as titrants. Examples are bromine, chlorine, Ti3+, Sn2+, Cr2+, and Karl Fischer reagents (iodine).
* Coulometric titration can also be performed under inert atmosphere or be remotely controlled e.g. with radioactive substances.
* Complete automation is simpler.

==Applications==

===Karl Fischer reaction to determine water content===

The Karl Fischer reaction uses a coulometric titration to determine the amount of water in a sample. It can determine concentrations of water on the order of milligrams per liter. It is used to find the amount of water in substances such as butter, sugar, cheese, paper, and petroleum.

The reaction involves converting solid iodine into hydrogen iodide in the presence of sulfur dioxide and water. Methanol is most often used as the solvent, but ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol also work. Pyridine is often used to prevent the buildup of sulfuric acid, although the use of imidazole and diethanolamine for this role are becoming more common. All reagents must be anhydrous for the analysis to be quantitative. The balanced chemical equation, using methanol and pyridine, is:

formula_1

In this reaction, a single molecule of water reacts with a molecule of iodine. Since this technique is used to determine the water content of samples, atmospheric humidity could alter the results. Therefore, the system is usually isolated with drying tubes or placed in an inert gas container. In addition, the solvent will undoubtedly have some water in it so the solvent&#x27;s water content must be measured to compensate for this inaccuracy.

To determine the amount of water in the sample, analysis must first be performed using either back or direct titration. In the direct method, just enough of the reagents will be added to completely use up all of the water. At this point in the titration, the current approaches zero. It is then possible to relate the amount of reagents used to the amount of water in the system via stoichiometry. The back-titration method is similar, but involves the addition of an excess of the reagent. This excess is then consumed by adding a known amount of a standard solution with known water content. The result reflects the water content of the sample and the standard solution. Since the amount of water in the standard solution is known, the difference reflects the water content of the sample.

===Determination of film thickness===

Coulometry can be used in the determination of the thickness of metallic coatings. This method is called surface coulometry and is performed by measuring the quantity of electricity needed to dissolve a well-defined area of the coating. The film thickness formula_2 is proportional to the constant current formula_3, the molecular weight formula_4 of the metal, the density formula_5 of the metal, and the surface area formula_6:

formula_7

The electrodes for this reaction are often platinum electrode and an electrode that relates to the reaction. For tin coating on a copper wire, a tin electrode is used, while a sodium chloride-zinc sulfate electrode would be used to determine the zinc film on a piece of steel. Special cells have been created to adhere to the surface of the metal to measure its thickness. These are basically columns with the internal electrodes with magnets or weights to attach to the surface. The results obtained by this coulometric method are similar to those achieved by other chemical and metallurgic techniques.

=== Coulometry in Healthcare ===

==== Determination of Chloride Levels ====
A type of clinical chemistry is measuring chloride levels in blood samples through a Cotlove chloridometer. Kidneys are responsible for the reabsorption of chloride to maintain electrolyte homeostasis. Measuring chloride levels allows for electrolyte stability, without this feature diseases such as hyperchoremia and hypochloremia would be harder to detect leaving body functions compromised.

==== Determination of Antioxidant Capacity in Human Blood ====
Coulometry can be used to measure the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in blood and plasma through electrogenerated bromide. A method was developed that used TAC blood sampled from patients with chronic renal disease going through hemodialysis to research changes in TAC levels that could then be applied in clinics. 

==Coulometers==

===Electronic coulometer===
The electronic coulometer is based on the application of the operational amplifier in the &quot;integrator&quot;-type circuit. The current passed through the resistor R1 makes a potential drop which is integrated by operational amplifier on the capacitor plates; the higher current, the larger the potential drop. The current need not be constant. In such scheme &quot;V&quot;out is proportional of the passed charge. Sensitivity of the coulometer can be changed by choosing of the appropriate value of &quot;R&quot;1.

===Electrochemical coulometers===
There are three common types of coulometers based on electrochemical processes:
* Copper coulometer
* Mercury coulometer
* Hofmann voltameter

&quot;Voltameter&quot; is a synonym for &quot;coulometer&quot;.

=== Coulometric Microtitrators ===
An acid-base microtitorator utilizes the electrolysis of water, where protons or hydroxide ions are produced at the working electrode. The analyte reacts with the generated reagent, buffering the overall rate of reagent generation. A pH gradient forms from the diffusion of these reagents, where a pH sensor will determine the endpoint. 

Some advantages of using a microtitrator include the fast completion time of the titration due to the micro-scale. Additionally, a negligibly small amount of the sample is consumed, so titrations can be repeatedly analyzed with the same sample. On the contrary, microtitrators require calibration because diffusion is variable, and thus this method is not absolute.

<doc id="1221476" wikidata="Q54314" url="?curid=1221476" title="Chris Hemsworth">
<text>Christopher Hemsworth (born 11 August 1983) is an Australian actor. Born and raised in Melbourne, Victoria and Bulman, Northern Territory, he rose to prominence playing Kim Hyde in the Australian television series &quot;Home and Away&quot; (2004–2007) before beginning a film career in Hollywood. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Hemsworth starred as Thor in the 2011 film of the same name and reprised the role in several subsequent installments, which established him among the world&#x27;s highest-paid actors.

His other film roles include the action films &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; (2012) and its sequel &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot; (2016), &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (2012), &quot;Blackhat&quot; (2015), &quot;Men in Black: International&quot; (2019), &quot;Extraction&quot; (2020) and its 2023 sequel, the thriller &quot;A Perfect Getaway&quot; (2009), and the comedy &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (2016). Hemsworth&#x27;s most critically acclaimed films include the comedy horror &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; (2012), the biographical sports film &quot;Rush&quot; (2013) in which he portrayed James Hunt, and the action film &quot;&quot; (2024); the latter earned him a nomination for the AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

==Early life==
Christopher Hemsworth was born on 11 August 1983 in Melbourne, to Leonie (née van Os), an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counsellor. He is the second of three sons, following Luke (b. 1980) and preceding Liam (b. 1990); both of them are also actors. His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent; on his paternal line he is of English, Scottish, and German ancestry. He was brought up both in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has said, &quot;My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback, and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.&quot; He attended high school at Heathmont College before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a few years later to Phillip Island.

==Career==
===Early work (2002–2010)===
Hemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series. In 2002, Hemsworth starred in three episodes of fantasy television series &quot;Guinevere Jones&quot; as King Arthur, as well as making an appearance in soap opera series &quot;Neighbours&quot; and one episode of &quot;Marshall Law&quot;. The following year, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The Saddle Club&quot;. In 2004, Hemsworth auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot;. He did not receive the part, but was subsequently recalled for the part of Kim Hyde. He moved to Sydney to join the cast, appearing in 171 episodes of the series. He left the cast of &quot;Home and Away&quot; on 3 July 2007. Hemsworth later remarked that although he became more visible after &quot;Home and Away&quot;, his work on a soap opera did not earn him respect within the film industry.

Hemsworth was a contestant on the fifth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars Australia&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Abbey Ross. The season premiered on 26 September 2006, and after six weeks, Hemsworth was eliminated on 7 November. Hemsworth&#x27;s appearance in the franchise almost cost him the role of Thor, as producers of the Marvel film franchise feared fans would be put off.

In 2009, Hemsworth played James T. Kirk&#x27;s father, George Kirk, in the opening scenes of J. J. Abrams&#x27; film &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The role was initially offered to Matt Damon, who turned it down; Abrams appreciated Hemsworth taking on the role. Josh Tyler of &quot;CinemaBlend&quot; was impressed with Hemsworth, describing the actor&#x27;s scene as the &quot;best five minutes I&#x27;ve spent in a movie theater this year.&quot; The film was a box office success, grossing US$385.7 million. That same year, Hemsworth played the character Kale Garrity in the thriller &quot;A Perfect Getaway&quot;. It received mixed reviews, but Hemsworth was praised for his &quot;appropriately intimidating&quot; performance of a &quot;thuggish backpacker.&quot; Paul Young of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; also praised Hemsworth&#x27;s performance as &quot;solid.&quot;

Hemsworth went on to play Sam in 2010&#x27;s &quot;Ca$h&quot; alongside English actor Sean Bean, which was the first film he shot when he arrived in the United States. The film&#x27;s director, Stephen Milburn Anderson, said Hemsworth had only been in the United States for six weeks when he had auditioned for the role, recalling, &quot;Here&#x27;s a guy who is young, has the right look, is a very good actor and, let&#x27;s face it, he&#x27;s beautiful. So I say, we need to get this guy in. I was very impressed&quot;. In November 2010, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; named Hemsworth one of the young male actors who are &quot;pushing – or being pushed&quot; onto the Hollywood &quot;A-List&quot;.

===Thor and worldwide recognition (2011–2015)===
In 2011, Sony Pictures announced that Hemsworth would star in the thriller &quot;Shadow Runner&quot;, but the film was never made. That same year, Hemsworth was cast as the superhero Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His first film in the franchise was 2011&#x27;s &quot;Thor&quot;. He and castmate Tom Hiddleston, who ultimately played Loki, had each auditioned for the role, for which Hemsworth said he gained 20 pounds of muscle. With a worldwide gross of US$449.3 million, &quot;Thor&quot; was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011. The film received positive reviews, and Hemsworth&#x27;s portrayal of the God of Thunder was praised by Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Hemsworth reprised the role the following year for the film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) as one of the six superheroesalongside Robert Downey Jr.&#x27;s Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Evans&#x27; Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo&#x27;s Bruce Banner / Hulk, Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s Natasha Romanova / Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner&#x27;s Clint Barton / Hawkeyesent to defend Earth from his adopted brother, Loki. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over US$1.5 billion worldwide. The ensemble cast was praised for their onscreen chemistry by Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Hemsworth shot the horror film &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; shortly after the release of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but it went unreleased until 2012. It garnered positive reviews, and his portrayal of Alpha male jock Curt Vaughan was described by Alison Foreman of Mashable as his &quot;sexiest&quot; role yet. Hemsworth later starred opposite Kristen Stewart in the film &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; (2012) as the Huntsman. Although a commercial success, grossing US$396 million worldwide, it received mixed reviews. Critics were critical of Hemsworth and Stewart&#x27;s onscreen chemistry, and Angela Watercutter of &quot;Wired&quot; felt the characters were &quot;not fully fleshed-out.&quot; Hemsworth was cast as Jed Eckert in the 2012 &quot;Red Dawn&quot; remake after MGM saw dailies footage of a scene from &quot;The Cabin in the Woods;&quot; he was cast as Thor two days after being cast in &quot;Red Dawn&quot;. The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only US$50 million against a production budget of US$65 million, and received negative reviews.

In 2013, Hemsworth starred in Ron Howard&#x27;s sports drama film &quot;Rush&quot;, as Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt. Henry Barnes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was impressed with Hemsworth&#x27;s performance, praising the actor for delivering the &quot;superb script&quot; with &quot;some mastery.&quot; Later that year, Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor for the sequel to &quot;Thor&quot; in &quot;&quot; (2013). Although a commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$644.6 million, the film became the lowest-rated film in the MCU franchise on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes at 66% approval rating. The chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston was praised by critics; Ben Child of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth&#x27;s impressive collective charisma, &quot;Thor: The Dark World&quot; is far from a franchise killer.&quot;

In 2015, Hemsworth starred in director Michael Mann&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Blackhat&quot;, opposite Viola Davis. The film bombed at the box office and was poorly received. For many critics, a significant issue of the film was the casting of Hemsworth as a hacker; Christy Lemire of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; remarked, &quot;Anyone who makes [their] way in the world sitting in front of a computer screen all day is not going to look as hunky as Hemsworth.&quot; Hemsworth himself later admitted to being displeased with his performance: &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy what I did in the film,&quot; he commented. &quot;It just felt flat, and it was also an attempt to do what I thought people might have wanted to see. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m good in that space.&quot; He reprised his role as Thor for the fourth time in the sequel to &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;&quot;. In addition to the film receiving positive reviews and grossing over US$1.4 billion worldwide, Hemsworth also won the People&#x27;s Choice Awards for Favorite Action Movie Actor. Hemsworth returned to the set of &quot;Home and Away&quot; in November 2014 to film a scene as an extra and not as his character Kim Hyde. The episode which he appeared in was broadcast on 19 May 2015.

That same year, he co-starred in the comedy film &quot;Vacation&quot;, along with Ed Helms, a revival of the film series that originally starred Chevy Chase. He was nominated for the MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss with Leslie Mann. His last 2015 film was &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Nathaniel Philbrick, with Hemsworth playing first mate Owen Chase. In an interview on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, he said that to prepare for the role of starving sailors, the cast was put on a diet of 500–600 calories a day to lose weight. &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box office disappointment, grossing US$93 million against a US$100 million budget, but Hemsworth received a nomination for Choice Movie Actor: Action at the 18th Teen Choice Awards.

===Continued commercial success (2016–present)===
In 2016, Hemsworth reprised the role of Eric the Huntsman in &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot;, alongside Jessica Chastain, who played his love interest. Writing for IndieWire, Oliver Lyttelton criticised the onscreen chemistry between Hemsworth and Chastain, stating that &quot;they&#x27;re both struggling uphill against accents they&#x27;re palpably not comfortable with, displaying zero chemistry, and frankly appearing to be in different films.&quot; The film underperformed compared to its predecessor, grossing only US$165 million. Hemsworth later joined the cast of the reboot &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film, playing Kevin the receptionist. The film disappointed critically and commercially, but Hemsworth was praised for &quot;deliver[ing] the most fun&quot; by Caroline Westbrook of &quot;Metro&quot; and won the Kids&#x27; Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actor.

Hemsworth reprised his role as Thor in &quot;&quot;, released on 3 November 2017 in the U.S., and again in both the third and fourth &quot;Avengers&quot; films, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in 2018 and 2019 respectively. All three films were a critical and commercial success. Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com likened Hemsworth&#x27;s acting to Cary Grant, stating that &quot;Hemsworth&#x27;s charisma holds [&quot;Thor: Ragnarok&quot;] together whenever it threatens to spin apart&quot;. Hemsworth won the Teen Choice Awards for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor. Meanwhile, in his review of &quot;&quot;, Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; acknowledged &quot;Hemsworth&#x27;s Thor, endearing despite some ragged material and the actor&#x27;s seemingly limited dramatic range&quot; while praising Hemsworth in the MCU Infinity Saga finale &quot;as the graceful, exuberant comic actor he was destined to be, while Thor morphs, alarmingly and charminglyyet still heroicallyinto a beer-bellied apparition who could pass for Jeff Lebowski.&quot; In 2017, Hemsworth was the guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Disneyland.

Hemsworth was to reprise his role as George Kirk in the fourth film of the rebooted &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series, but he left the project in August 2018 after contract negotiations fell through; Hemsworth later said he found the script underwhelming. In 2019, he also starred in a spin-off of the &quot;Men in Black&quot; series, titled &quot;Men in Black: International&quot;. The film grossed US$253 million worldwide and received generally unfavourable reviews from critics, who criticised the &quot;lackluster action and forgettable plot,&quot; although the chemistry between Hemsworth and co-star Tessa Thompson was praised. 

The following year, Hemsworth starred in the Netflix action thriller &quot;Extraction&quot;, reuniting him with the Russo brothers, who served as producers. After being watched by 90 million households in its initial month of release, the film broke Netflix&#x27;s viewership record previously held by &quot;Bird Box&quot;. Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor in the fourth film, &quot;&quot;. Filming began in February 2021 in Australia, and it was released in 2022.

Hemsworth worked on &quot;Limitless With Chris Hemsworth&quot; in 2022, a six-part documentary series, for National Geographic. The show paired Hemsworth with noted filmmaker Darren Aronofsky. The show has Hemsworth appearing in a variety of different ways that humans have sought to increase their health in a variety of different ways. The episodes saw Hemsworth take a plunge in icy Arctic water, fast for long periods of time, and participate in an indigenous Australian ceremony. The last of which resulted in some controversy for the show, as Indigenous groups claimed that filming at the sacred site was disrespectful to the culture. Hemsworth returned as Tyler Rake in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Extraction 2&quot; (2023), which earned him $20 million.

Hemsworth starred in the &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; spin-off &quot;&quot;, released in May 2024. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that he had &quot;perhaps created one of the all-time-great screen villains&quot; in his role as the warlord Dementus. Hemsworth voiced a young Optimus Prime in the Transformers prequel film &quot;Transformers One&quot;. In October 2024, Hemsworth entered talks to play the title character in Paul King&#x27;s &quot;Prince Charming&quot; for Disney.

==Public image==
After appearing as Thor in the MCU franchise, Hemsworth&#x27;s physique gained attention from fans. His exercise routines have been regularly discussed in the media, including &quot;The Times of India&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;, MensXP, &quot;Entertainment Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Metro&quot;. He later created the fitness app Centr, which provides paying customers access to nutrition, wellness, and exercise routines. In 2014, he was named the &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; by &quot;People&quot; magazine.

Hemsworth is an avid supporter of the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League. He was the star of the AFL&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Everything&#x27;s Possible&quot; campaign, donating the fees for his involvement to the Australian Children Foundation. Hemsworth was also the star in the AFL&#x27;s 2017 &quot;I&#x27;d Like to See That&quot; commercial.

===Wealth===
As his career in Hollywood films has developed, Hemsworth has become one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid actors. He appeared in &quot;Forbes&quot;″ World&#x27;s Highest Paid Actors list in 2014, 2015, and 2018. Additionally, he ranked 31st in the magazine&#x27;s list of Highest Paid Celebrities in 2018 and 24th in 2019 with estimated earnings of US$76.4 million.

In May 2020, Chris and his brother Liam were among the celebrities who read an installment of Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; in aid of the global-non profit charity Partners In Health, co-founded by Dahl&#x27;s daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas.

Hemsworth began dating Spanish model and actress Elsa Pataky in early 2010, after meeting through their mutual representatives. They married in December 2010. The couple have a daughter, born in May 2012 and twin sons, born in March 2014. In 2015, the family moved from Los Angeles to Byron Bay, New South Wales, in his native Australia. Hemsworth speaks limited Spanish and Indonesian.

Hemsworth&#x27;s children train Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Thalison Soares, and he has regularly taken them to compete in national tournaments.

Hemsworth was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

In episode five of his National Geographic documentary &quot;Limitless&quot; (2022), Hemsworth revealed that his maternal grandfather suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It was also revealed that Hemsworth himself has inherited two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from his mother and one from his father, which makes it eight to ten times likelier for him to eventually develop Alzheimer&#x27;s disease than the general population.

<text>The Flight of the Phoenix is a 1964 novel by Elleston Trevor. The plot involves the crash of a transport aircraft in the middle of a desert and the survivors&#x27; desperate attempt to save themselves. The book was the basis for the 1965 film &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; starring James Stewart and the 2004 remake titled &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot;.
&quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; came at the midpoint of Trevor&#x27;s career and led to a bidding war over its film rights.

==Plot summary==
Pilot Frank Towns and navigator Lew Moran are ferrying a mixed bag of passengers from the Jebel oil town in the Libyan desert, among them oil workers, two British soldiers, and a German who was visiting his brother. An unexpected sandstorm forces the aircraft down, damaging it, killing two of the men, and severely injuring the German. In the book, the action takes place in the Libyan part of the Sahara.

The survivors wait for rescue but the storm has blown them far off course, far away from a search area. After several days, Captain Harris marches toward a distant oasis together with another passenger. His aide, Sergeant Watson feigns a sprained ankle to stay behind. A third man follows them. Days later, Harris barely manages to return to the crash site. The others are lost.

As the water begins to run out, Stringer, a precise, arrogant English aeronautical engineer, proposes a radical solution: rebuild a new aircraft from the wreckage of the old twin-boom aircraft, using the undamaged boom and adding skids to take off. The men set to work.

At one point, a nearby party of nomadic tribesmen is spotted. Captain Harris decides to seek their help. This time, Sergeant Watson outright refuses to accompany him. Instead another survivor, a Texan named Loomis, volunteers. The next day, Towns finds their looted bodies, throats cut, and the nomads gone.

Later, Towns learns that Stringer designs &quot;model&quot; aircraft, not full-scale planes. Fearing the effect on morale, he and Moran keep their discovery secret, believing Stringer&#x27;s plan is doomed. However, the aircraft is reborn, like the mythical Phoenix rising from its own ashes. It flies the remaining passengers, strapped to the outside of the fuselage, to an oasis and civilization.

==Film adaptations==

The book was the basis of a 1965 film starring James Stewart, Richard Attenborough, and Hardy Krüger. The 2004 remake featuring Dennis Quaid was also based on the novel, although it was re-located to the Gobi Desert in Asia.

<doc id="1221496" wikidata="Q3754919" url="?curid=1221496" title="Fusker">
<text>Fusker is a type of website or utility that extracts images in bulk from a website (typically from free hosted galleries) by systematically loading and downloading images following a pattern in the website&#x27;s URL scheme. Fusking or fuskering is often used to extract private and nude photos without consent of the owner.

Fusker software allows users to identify a sequence of images with a single pattern, for example: codice_1. This example would identify images pic1.jpg through pic16.jpg. When this pattern is given to a fusker website, the website would produce a page that displays all sixteen images in that range. Patterns can also contain lists of words, such as codice_2, which will produce three URLs, each with one word from the bracketed list. The web page is then presented to the person who entered the fusker, and can also be saved on the fusker web server so that other people may view it. 

== Fusker implementations ==

Server-side fusker software extracts content (e.g. image or video) from its original location and displays it in a new page on the client-side (user&#x27;s web browser). Content is separated from the surrounding information that the content host may have intended (e.g. links to affiliates or pay-per-click ads). However, the content is not downloaded locally to the client by the fusker server; the new page that the fusker server produces instructs the client web browser to retrieve each piece of content from the content host web server and display it in the new page. This can lead to excessive internet bandwidth usage and waste. Many server-side implementations of the Fusker technology are available on the web.

In addition, a fusker can also be implemented as client software that completely bypasses the need for a third-party fusker web site. By eliminating the need to fusker via a web site, the need to use a web browser is also eliminated. Due to not using a web browser, fusker client software will often store downloaded content locally on the client machine. This reduces Internet bandwidth usage since fusker client software, unlike a web browser, only retrieves content once (no repeat visits to web pages). Fusker client software is able to do this because it can effectively emulate a web browser; referrer and user agent headers are rewritten to an acceptable value, and more complex implementations can also emulate a web browser to the point of being able to click links and log in to accounts. However, just like server-based fuskers, client software fuskers also separate content from its original surroundings, which may have included advertisements on the content host&#x27;s web site.

With the sophistication of the modern web browser it is now possible to run a client-side fusker software application fully within a web browser such as Internet Explorer. These web browser implementations are capable of reading and extracting the image information in the web pages you browse. They no longer rely on searches of domains with random search strings nor IP address spoofing by impersonating a referrer or user agent. Web browser fusker applications essentially provide a scrapbooking interface within the web browser which allows direct and customized access to the web image content. Some implementations allow you to save sets of fusker information as a collection file which can be electronically shared with other users of the fusker application without the need to store or transmit gigabytes of image data.

== Criticism ==
Visitors to a fusker website frequently see copyrighted pornographic images that have been separated from their intended context, known as hot-linking. Fuskers have been used to obtain media from nude photos hosted on private or password-protected album in Photobucket without the consent of the media owners. Some of these images were then uploaded to the r/photobucketplunder Reddit community, which had 8000 subscribers before it was shut down when Photobucket sent a DMCA request to the community&#x27;s moderators.

Companies that provide free hosted galleries strongly dislike fuskers because they have the potential to cost them a lot of money in bandwidth bills, and because the only reason the free galleries are provided is to entice the user into clicking on a more profitable link, and those links are no longer displayed when a fusker is used. 

Some client-side fusker implementations blindly search domains for images based on common file names and directory structures. Some argue the numerous HTTP 404 &quot;file not found&quot; and HTTP 403 &quot;forbidden&quot; server errors generated constitute a denial of service attack. In response, most web site administrators check the referrer and user agent headers sent by the requesting client software to prevent their images from being &quot;fuskered&quot;, or require users to log in. However, some fusker software has the ability to emulate a legitimate web browser. referrer and user agent headers are rewritten to an acceptable value, and more complex implementations can also emulate a web browser to the point of being able to click links and log into accounts.

Web browser implementations running within a legitimate browser offer a more legitimate access to the web content. Access through these applications is very similar to having saved a bookmark to the image. However, unlike a bookmark, these implementations may access thousands of images at the same time and may also overload servers not capable of servicing this amount of content.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Fusker&quot; is a Danish term which originally meant a person covertly doing work outside the official guilds. It came into Danish around 1700 from German , meaning botcher. Later it came to mean someone cheating (for example using company resources for personal benefit) or alternately doing shoddy work.

== History ==

The original fusker technology was created by Carthag Tuek, who made the Perl CGI script as a work-alike of the UNIX/Linux cURL tool, specifically its URL-globbing functionality.

The idea has been continued by others and ported to other scripting languages.

<doc id="1221498" wikidata="Q57420936" url="?curid=1221498" title="Whenuapai">
<text>Whenuapai is a suburb and aerodrome located in northwestern Auckland, in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located on the shore of the Upper Waitematā Harbour, 15 kilometres to the northwest of Auckland&#x27;s city centre. It is one of the landing points for the Southern Cross telecommunications Cables.

==Etymology==

The name Whenuapai was coined by resident Theophilus Wake, a Māori language name meaning &quot;good land&quot;. When Wake settled in the area in 1911, he chose the name , meaning &quot;calm waters&quot;. As the settlement grew, Wake applied for a post office to be established for the community. The post office service required a different name, due to another location named Waimarie, and Wake chose the name Whenuapai instead. The name Whenuapai was officially adopted on 23 March 1914, and the first references to Whenuapai in newspapers can be found from May 1914.

The traditional Te Kawerau ā Maki name for the area is , which is the name of the stream that flows north from Whenuapai to the Upper Waitematā Harbour. A kāinga was located on the shores of the stream, , which took its name from the stream, .

==History==
In the 19th century, northern Whenuapai was the location of Ockleston&#x27;s pottery, a brickworks located on the Kotukutuku Inlet of the Waitematā Harbour. The area was settled by pacifist Theophilus Wake in 1911. Wake was joined by other like-minded pacifists in the 1910s, and a community developed at Whenuapai.

Tobacco was grown as a crop in Whenuapai and by 1929 more than 120,000 pounds of tobacco were produced at Whenuapai and nearby Riverheard. By 1940 however tobacco production would cease and Motueka became the main area for tobacco cultivation.

===RNZAF facilities===

In 1938 under the Public Works Act, the New Zealand Government several hundred acres of land at Whenuapai, in order to create a base for Wellington bomber, prior to the onset of World War II.

Post World War II Auckland became a centre for RNZAF transport and maritime squadrons. From 1945 to 1965 Whenuapai was also Auckland&#x27;s civil international airport. Whenuapai and Hobsonville bases were integrated in 1965 to form RNZAF Base Auckland. Hobsonville is now closed, with the RNZAF continuing to lease a few remaining facilities.

Today, with a personnel strength of around 1100, Base Auckland is the home for:

* No. 5 Squadron (P-3K2 Orion)
* No. 6 Squadron (SH-2G(I) Seasprite)
* No. 40 Squadron (C-130 Hercules and Boeing 757)
* RNZAF Parachute Training and Support Unit,
* RNZAF Security Forces Military Working Dog Training School
* RNZAF Aviation Medicine Unit.
* RNZAF Operations Squadron
* RNZAF Police

===Whenuapai Airport 1945–65===
In 1945 the government made the RNZAF Station at Whenuapai available for civil airline operations on a temporary basis and with RNZAF activities to take precedence. That &quot;temporary basis&quot; lasted twenty years and the RNZAF had to give up their two smaller hangars and move to the north apron of their own airfield. In the 1940s Whenuapai was one of three aerodromes in the country with sealed runways, the others being Paraparaumu and Ohakea. Whenuapai was adopted as the international airport for Auckland, despite the benefits of the location of the Mangere Aerodrome, due to its ongoing use by the RNZAF meaning there were no additional costs for the Auckland City Council.

For a short time, Auckland had three aerodromes—the seaplane aerodrome at Mechanics Bay where Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) operated from 1940–54; the city&#x27;s domestic airport—at the then small grass airstrip at Māngere, on the site of the present Auckland Airport; and weekly Pan American and British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (the latter&#x27;s services originally operated by Australian National Airways) services with DC-4s from Whenuapai. Also immediately post-war; the RNZAF operated many of the civil services while National Airways Corporation (NAC) was being organised, and to add to the confusion; some of Auckland&#x27;s domestic services departed from Whenuapai as well. Hills adjacent to the Whenuapai site limited the ability of new generation aircraft to use the site.

In 1947 the government closed Māngere to all but light aircraft citing safety concerns, and NAC moved to Whenuapai. (At the same time, the government closed Wellington&#x27;s Rongotai Airport, for the same reasons, and NAC had to move to Paraparaumu, 35 miles from the city.)

In addition to domestic services, NAC flew a DC-3 weekly to Norfolk Island from Whenuapai, and fortnightly on a route that took a week each way; Whenuapai—Norfolk Island—Nadi—Apia—Tongatapu—Aitutaki—Rarotonga. The Norfolk Island service continued until 1955 when Qantas, chartered to TEAL, took over the route with a DC-4; and the Pacific Service was handed over to TEAL in 1952.

The next major development at Whenuapai was in May 1954, when British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines was wound up, its DC-6s given to TEAL, and that airline sold all except two of its flying boats and moved to Whenuapai. It kept one Solent in reserve and sent the other to Suva to fly the leg to Tahiti, which didn&#x27;t get a landplane airport until 1960. The first part of the Coral Route was then operated by DC-6 from Whenuapai to Nadi.

Airport diagram for 1956

Despite problems with its runway Whenuapai continued as Auckland&#x27;s international airport through the 1950s. In 1960 the longest runway was 6590 feet (6664 ft a few years later) which allowed BOAC Comet flights, but larger jet airliners such as the DC-8 and the B707 demanded a new international airport and work on Auckland Airport began. The first international flight from Auckland Airport was on 24 November 1965 and it officially opened on Anniversary Weekend (29–31 January), 1966 after which Whenuapai Airport reverted to purely military use as an Aerodrome.

===Reverting to Military Aerodrome and recent developments===
The operational tempo at Whenuapai continues at the level it has been at for the last forty years, although the closure of the adjacent Hobsonville base has seen the departure of rotary operations (primarily the UH1H Iroquois) to RNZAF Base Ohakea. With the budget for moving the base to Ohakea exceeding one billion dollars, the previously scheduled closure by the New Zealand Labour government (originally by 2007, then 2010 or, at latest, 2014) was cancelled by the incoming National government of 2008. There were suggestions that it be used as Auckland&#x27;s second international Airport. Reasons put forward in favour were that more people in the Auckland region already lived closer to the aerodrome than to Māngere Airport and that it was projected that within 15 years Whenuapai would be closer for more than a million Aucklanders.

The three local authorities that comprised the north west sector of the Auckland Region, Rodney District Council, North Shore City Council and Waitakere City Council all favoured the second airport concept at one time or another and at least one poll, by the Waitakere City Council in late 2006, indicated 77% support and 22% opposition by the public.

However, in the local body elections of October 2007, the pro-airport North Shore City mayor was defeated by an anti-airport mayoral candidate with indications that the airport issue was the most important of factors considered by voters.

Subsequently, North Shore City Council reversed support for a Whenuapai International Airport while the Waitakere City Council remained in favour. In 2010, all councils were amalgamated into the new Auckland Council and therefore support for a commercial airport was dropped. The proposal had also been opposed by the government.

<text>Aston George Taylor Jr. (born August 5, 1967), professionally known as Funkmaster Flex, is an American DJ, rapper, record producer, and host on New York City&#x27;s Hot 97 radio station. In 1992, he became host of the first hip hop radio show on Hot 97 in New York, which was a pop radio station at the time.

==Early life==
Aston Taylor Jr. was born in the Bronx borough of New York City to Jamaican immigrant parents. His father, DJ Aston George Taylor Sr., was a sound system professional. He was raised in a strict, religious household. At the age of 16, he began DJing at local nightclubs.

==Radio career==
By the age of 19, Flex began working with fellow Bronx native Chuck Chillout for WRKS 98.7 Kiss-FM in New York. He later left KISS, and spent a brief period at 107.5 WBLS-FM. In the early 1990s, Flex made club appearances at many of Vito Bruno&#x27;s operated nightclubs. Bruno later convinced Joel Salkowitz, a regional vice president of Hot 97, to begin airing live broadcasts from clubs where he was performing. When they realized the resurgence of hip hop was coming fast from its decline in the eighties, they increased the hours of this urban radio programming. 

Due to the success of that programming, in the spring of 1992 Funkmaster Flex began mixing and hosting his own show, a specialized rap program on Hot 97. With this, Hot 97 became the first pop station in New York to showcase rap. Flex has been with Hot 97 ever since, and currently airs nationally through syndication during weeknights and weekends. 

He is well known for his signature &quot;bomb drop&quot; sound effect over records. On July 20, 2011, Kanye West &amp; Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Otis&quot; premiered on Flex&#x27;s Hot 97 radio show. Despite the song itself lasting under 3 minutes, it took over 22 minutes for Flex to go through from start to finish, as he restarted the song 25 times (roughly once every 53 seconds) and played the bomb drop sound effect 63 times. Flex is also responsible for his early mentorship of his friend and former coworker at Hot 97, Angie Martinez.

==Website==
On August 3, 2010, Flex launched his news website InFlexWeTrust.com. He makes the audio, video and mp3&#x27;s of artist freestyles from his show &quot;exclusively&quot; available on the site. The site also posts entertainment news, music, cars, models, sports and technology. It joined the Complex media network in September 2012, and has been mentioned in songs, including Fabolous&#x27; &quot;So NY.&quot;

==Music production==
By the mid-1990s, Flex was signed by a major record label, Loud Records, for a series of mixtapes entitled &quot;60 Minutes of Funk&quot;. All four were certified gold by the RIAA in the US. In 1995 he formed The Flip Squad along with seven of New York City&#x27;s most respected disc jockeys, including Biz Markie, &quot;BounceMasta&quot; Doo Wop, Big Kap, DJ Enuff, Mister Cee, Frankie Cutlass, DJ Riz, Cipha Sounds and Mark Ronson. Their self-titled debut LP was released on MCA in late 1998. In 1999, he released The Tunnel with Def Jam, which included songs by artists Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Eminem, LL Cool J, DJ Myth, Method Man, DMX, Nas and Snoop Dogg. Other acts he has worked with include Yvette Michele, Pras, DJ Kool, Foxy Brown and Armand Van Helden.

In October 2020, Flex announced plans of an upcoming album. In December, he released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Lurkin&quot;, with King Von, while confirming that the album would feature an array of artists, including Juice Wrld, Kodak Black, Post Malone, Lil Baby, and Pop Smoke, among others. A release date is yet to be announced, however the album will be released through Flex&#x27;s own label IFWT Films and Records.

==Television==
Funkmaster Flex first appeared on television in the early nineties on &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot; hosted by Fab 5 Freddy, DJ Myth, Ed Lover, and Doctor Dré. He later did various hip-hop and automobile spots for MTV.

In 2003, Flex debuted his first television series, Ride with Funkmaster Flex on the Spike cable network. The show documented the subculture of cars popular in hip hop culture. Noteworthy moments in the series included a look into Diddy&#x27;s private jet and a visit to Eminem&#x27;s studio.

Flex later developed a one-off Spike TV show race event – The Funkmaster Flex Super Series Invitational. The race featured 60 late-model stock car drivers at The Waterford Speedbowl in Connecticut. Celebrities like Orange County Choppers, LL Cool J, and Lil&#x27; Kim were brought out to watch the event.

ESPN noticed &quot;Ride with Funkmaster Flex&quot; and decided to create a show with Flex focusing on custom cars and interviewing athletes from the NBA, NFL, and Major League Baseball. Guests included Danica Patrick, Terrell Owens, and Jason Giambi. The show was called &quot;All Muscle with Funkmaster Flex&quot; and began airing early 2007.

Later in 2007, a second show called Car Wars with Funkmaster Flex premiered on ESPN. Car Wars asked different car customizers to modify existing vehicles for cash prizes. If featured automotive designers such as Patrick Schiavone, former Ford North American Truck &amp; SUV Design Director and currently Vice President of Design at Whirlpool, Ford Explorer Exterior Design Manager Melvin Betancourt and Louis D&#x27;erasmo of Valanca Auto Concepts.

For &quot;Fast Machines with Funkmaster Flex&quot;, Flex returned to Spike TV to focus on making muscle and modern car customization for celebrities. Examples included a 1955 Chevy Bel Air for Dale Earnhardt Jr., a 1966 Pontiac GTO for Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine and a 1970 Chevy Chevelle for the U.S. Marines. It also featured an interview with Royal Purple race driver Kathryn Minter.

In 2010, Flex returned to MTV with a new show – &quot;Funk Flex Full Throttle&quot;. The show featured Flex interviewing hip-hop artists and customizing cars; either on location at Spring Break, the New York Auto Show or in his garage. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; also integrated reality elements as Flex directed his team of car customizers at various builds and allowed viewers inside the lifestyle of Hip-Hop stars.

In 2014, Funkmaster Flex appeared on VH1 as part of the reality show &quot;This Is Hot 97&quot;.

==Car Show Tour==
Taylor developed and promotes an annual eight-city Funkmaster Flex Custom Car &amp; Bike Show Tour. It has had featured artists such as Drake, Nicki Minaj and Fabolous. Each stop showcases customized cars in competition for cash prizes and model and recording talent search. In 2010, he added the Funkmaster Flex Lifestyle Expo which included sneaker and DJ battles, video game competitions, skateboard demos.

He also displays some of his personal collection of roughly 40 muscle cars at each stop of the tour.

== Auto design ==

In 2005, Ford Motor Company opened its Dearborn design studio doors to Taylor to look at how to customize its product line-up and add exposure to the brand. He has since customized several models for Ford.

==Video games==
He is a voice actor in &quot;Quest for the Code&quot; in 2002.

FunkMaster Flex&#x27;s name was used on the American release for the PS2 video game &quot;Music 3000&quot;, &quot;FunkMaster Flex&#x27;s Digital Hitz Factory&quot; in 2004.

Flex is a featured DJ on The Beat 102.7 in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV, Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot;.

He is a celebrity adversary and an unlockable free agent fullback in season mode of &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot;. He also has an unlockable team, the Baurtwell Funkmasters.

<text>TC-1 is a luxury point and shoot camera that was produced by Minolta. It is a compact 35 mm clad in titanium, equipped with a G-Rokkor 28mm 3.5 lens. The TC-1 was equipped with a high quality lens and body, similar to other luxury compacts produced during the Japanese bubble economy era, including the Contax T line, Konica Hexar, Leica minilux, Nikon 28/35Ti, Ricoh GR series, and Rollei QZ 35W/35T. Expensive when initially released in 1996 with a suggested retail price of , it was produced in small numbers and since then has become collectible.

==Design==
According to Minolta, development of the TC-1 began when an engineer questioned why SLRs were too bulky to carry day-to-day, but compact cameras sacrificed image quality. It took experienced technicians 45 minutes to assemble a single camera by hand, as the 150+ delicate, miniaturized parts used were not suited for a high-volume assembly line. The outer shell is made of titanium, which gave the camera its name (&quot;Titanium Clad&quot;). It is approximately the same volume as three 35mm film cartridges.
The camera operates in aperture-priority autoexposure, with four selectable aperture settings of , 5.6, 8, or 16. Exposure compensation of up to ±4 EV is possible in  EV steps. One uncommon feature is the diaphragm, which used discrete circular Waterhouse stops rather than a iris with multiple diaphragm blades. It has received praise for its &quot;bokeh&quot; (out-of-focus characteristics).

In 1996, the Camera Journal Press Club of Japan awarded the TC-1 with the Camera Grand Prix. A special edition for the Japanese domestic market, finished in black, was built to celebrate Minolta&#x27;s 70th anniversary in 1998 and limited to 2500 examples. As part of the same anniversary, 2000 examples of the &quot;G-Rokkor&quot; lens from the TC-1 were sold as a limited-production interchangeable lens in M39 lens mount; unlike the TC-1, the M39 version of the &quot;G-Rokkor&quot; was equipped with a 9-blade iris diaphragm, offering the additional aperture settings of , 11, and 22. All versions of the TC-1 were discontinued by 2007 and has become collectible since then.

==Operation==

The TC-1 controls and display are provided on the top panel, with the exception of the aperture selector lever, which is on the lens. A small leather patch on the front of the camera facilitates grip by the right hand.

The button furthest to the right, when the camera is held by the photographer, is the shutter release. The photographer&#x27;s right index finger is intended to select the aperture, then use the shutter release button.

On the front edge of the camera is a slider which adjusts settings according to the position of the control dial. When the dial is in &quot;HOLD&quot; position, it is locked and the central button is required to turn the dial to the appropriate manual control. Moving clockwise from &quot;HOLD&quot;, the camera provides controls for flash mode (on / off / &quot;night-portrait&quot; or fill), red-eye reduction, self timer (2 and 10 seconds), ISO (manual film speed), autofocus / manual focus distance, and exposure compensation. A button on the top edge of the rear panel, just under the control dial, engages the spot meter.

The button between the setting adjustment slider and dial resets the focus mode to autofocus.

On the left edge of the camera, a backlit LCD display provides feedback on settings while they are being adjusted. Illumination is turned on by a button just below the display on the top edge of the camera&#x27;s back.

<doc id="1221511" wikidata="Q6761426" url="?curid=1221511" title="Maria McKee (album)">
<text>Maria McKee is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Maria McKee, released in 1989.

==Production==
The songwriting was inspired in part by books about the history of vaudeville, as well as by Tennessee Williams plays.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Joe Brown called the album &quot;stunning&quot;, writing that &quot;aside from her luminous singing, the real success story of McKee&#x27;s solo album is her songwriting, highly developed and ambitious, full of melodic and rhythmic variety.&quot; Chris Willman writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated the album &quot;presents Maria McKee the person as something of an introspective, even introverted loner reeling from a romantic split.&quot; Ira Robbins considered McKee&#x27;s &quot;lyrics don&#x27;t reveal any clear artistic mission and Mitchell Froom&#x27;s overstylized production ... drowns and/or drains her personality out of the album, leaving characterless elegance instead of a strong statement.&quot; Oscar Wednesday of &quot;Cashbox&quot; was disappointed by this record. He wrote: &quot;I really wanted to love this album. As far as I&#x27;m concerned Maria McKee is one of the most talented and exciting singers around today. No, honest. But after listening to the album repeatedly, I found myself anything but captivated. Lone Justice&#x27;s second and final album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Shelter&quot;, was unfocused and awkward, and although this solo outing stands head-and-shoulders above that effort, it too feels a little unnatural.&quot;

Terry Staunton, writing for &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, felt that McKee&#x27;s decision to work with &quot;the elite of American sessions musicians&quot; produced &quot;astonishing results&quot; and suggested the album &quot;has to be one of the best records of the year&quot;. He praised McKee&#x27;s &quot;honey roast vocals&quot; for &quot;matching the frail passion of Patsy Cline, the fiery soul of Aretha Franklin and the forceful blues of Janis Joplin&quot;. Staunton added, &quot;Maria&#x27;s always been able to pen a good tune and here you&#x27;ll hear nine of her best.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; placed the album at No. 9 on its 1989 albums of the year list. Ian Gittins of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; summarised, &quot;&quot;Maria McKee&quot; is country, is blues, is soul, is rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, but is always one delicious demon possessed by the spirit of her songs. I defy you to hear this and not fall in love.&quot;

<doc id="1221516" wikidata="Q1271831" url="?curid=1221516" title="Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth">
<text>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), also termed bacterial overgrowth, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SBBOS), is a disorder of excessive bacterial growth in the small intestine. Unlike the colon (or large bowel), which is rich with bacteria, the small bowel usually has fewer than 100,000 organisms per millilitre. Patients with bacterial overgrowth typically develop symptoms which may include nausea, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss, and malabsorption by various mechanisms.

The diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth is made by a number of techniques, with the gold standard being an aspirate from the jejunum that grows in excess of 105 bacteria per millilitre. Risk factors for the development of bacterial overgrowth include dysmotility; anatomical disturbances in the bowel, including fistulae, diverticula and blind loops created after surgery, and resection of the ileo-cecal valve; gastroenteritis-induced alterations to the small intestine; and the use of certain medications, including proton pump inhibitors.

Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome is treated with an elemental diet or antibiotics, which may be given in a cyclic fashion to prevent tolerance to the antibiotics, sometimes followed by prokinetic drugs to prevent recurrence if dysmotility is a suspected cause.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms traditionally linked to SIBO include bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain/discomfort. Steatorrhea may be seen in more severe cases.
Bacterial overgrowth can cause a variety of symptoms, many of which are also found in other conditions, making the diagnosis challenging at times. Many of the symptoms are due to malabsorption of nutrients due to the effects of bacteria which either metabolize nutrients or cause inflammation of the small bowel, impairing absorption. The symptoms of bacterial overgrowth include nausea, flatus, constipation, bloating, abdominal distension, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, fatigue, and weakness. SIBO also causes an increased permeability of the small intestine. Some patients may lose weight. Children with bacterial overgrowth may develop malnutrition and have difficulty attaining proper growth. Steatorrhea, a sticky type of diarrhea where fats are not properly absorbed and spill into the stool, may also occur.

Patients with bacterial overgrowth that is longstanding can develop complications of their illness as a result of malabsorption of nutrients. Laboratory test results may include elevated folate (vitamin B9), and, less commonly, vitamin B12 deficiency or other nutritional deficiencies. Anemia may occur from a variety of mechanisms, as many of the nutrients involved in production of red blood cells are absorbed in the affected small bowel. Iron is absorbed in the more proximal parts of the small bowel, the duodenum and jejunum, and patients with malabsorption of iron can develop a microcytic anemia, with small red blood cells. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the last part of the small bowel, the ileum, and patients who malabsorb vitamin B12 can develop a megaloblastic anemia with large red blood cells.

===Related conditions===
In recent years, several proposed links between SIBO and other disorders have been made. However, the usual methodology of these studies involves the use of breath testing as an indirect investigation for SIBO. Breath testing has been criticized by some authors for being an imperfect test for SIBO, with multiple known false positives.

====Irritable bowel syndrome====
Some studies reported up to 80% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have SIBO (using the hydrogen breath test). IBS-D is associated with elevated hydrogen numbers on breath tests while IBS-C is associated with elevated methane numbers on breath tests. Subsequent studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction in IBS symptoms following therapy for SIBO.

Various mechanisms are involved in the development of diarrhea and IBS-D in bacterial overgrowth. First, the excessive bacterial concentrations can cause direct inflammation of the small bowel cells, leading to an inflammatory diarrhea. The malabsorption of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates may cause poorly digestible products to enter into the colon. This can cause an osmotic diarrhea or stimulate the colonic cells to cause a secretory diarrhea.

There is a lack of consensus however, regarding the suggested link between IBS and SIBO. Other authors concluded that the abnormal breath results so common in IBS patients do not suggest SIBO, and state that &quot;abnormal fermentation timing and dynamics of the breath test findings support a role for abnormal intestinal bacterial distribution in IBS.&quot; There is general consensus that breath tests are abnormal in IBS; however, the disagreement lies in whether this is representative of SIBO.

==Cause==
Certain people are more predisposed to the development of bacterial overgrowth because of certain risk factors. These factors can be grouped into four categories: (1) motility disorders, impaired movement of the small bowel, or anatomical changes that lead to stasis (a state in which the normal flow of a body liquid stops); (2) disorders of the immune system; (3) interference with the production of proteolytic enzymes, gastric acid, or bile; and (4) conditions that cause more bacteria from the colon to enter the small bowel.
In some people, methanogens may reside in the oral cavity, as evidenced by reductions in breath methane levels following mouthwash with chlorhexidine. This may affect results from hydrogen-methane breath testing.

Absence or impairment of the migrating motor complex (MMC), a cyclical motility pattern in the small intestine, and phase III of the MMC in particular, is associated with the development of SIBO. Problems with motility may either be diffuse, or localized to particular areas.

MMC impairment may be a result of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, drug use, or intestinal pseudo-obstruction among other causes. There is an overlap in findings between tropical sprue, post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in the pathophysiology of the three conditions and also SIBO can similarly sometimes be triggered by an acute gastrointestinal infection. As of 2020, there is still controversy about the role of SIBO in the pathogenesis of common functional symptoms such as those considered to be components of irritable bowel syndrome. Diseases like scleroderma cause diffuse slowing of the bowel, leading to increased bacterial concentrations. More commonly, the small bowel may have anatomical problems, such as out-pouchings known as diverticula that can cause bacteria to accumulate. After surgery involving the stomach and duodenum (most commonly with Billroth II antrectomy), a &quot;blind loop&quot; may be formed, leading to stasis of flow of intestinal contents. This can cause overgrowth, and is termed &quot;blind loop syndrome&quot;.

Systemic or metabolic disorders may lead to conditions allowing bacterial overgrowth as well. For example, diabetes can cause intestinal neuropathy, pancreatitis leading to pancreatic insufficiency can impair digestive enzyme production, and bile may be affected as part of cirrhosis of the liver. The use of proton pump inhibitors, a class of medication used to reduce stomach acid, is associated with an increased risk of developing SIBO.

Finally, abnormal connections between the bacteria-rich colon and the small bowel can increase the bacterial load in the small bowel. Patients with Crohn&#x27;s disease or other diseases of the ileum may require surgery that removes the ileocecal valve connecting the small and large bowel; this leads to an increased reflux of bacteria into the small bowel. After bariatric surgery for obesity, connections between the stomach and the ileum can be formed, which may increase bacterial load in the small bowel.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth can be made by physicians in various ways. Malabsorption can be detected by a test called the D-xylose absorption test. Xylose is a sugar that does not require enzymes to be digested. The D-xylose test involves having a patient drink a certain quantity of D-xylose, and measuring levels in the urine and blood; if there is no evidence of D-xylose in the urine and blood, it suggests that the small bowel is not absorbing properly (as opposed to problems with enzymes required for digestion).

The gold standard for detection of bacterial overgrowth is the aspiration of more than 105 bacteria per millilitre from the small bowel. The normal small bowel has less than 104 bacteria per millilitre. Some experts however, consider aspiration of more than 103 positive if the flora is predominately colonic type bacteria as these types of bacteria are considered pathological in excessive numbers in the small intestine. The reliability of aspiration in the diagnosis of SIBO has been questioned as SIBO can be patchy and the reproducibility can be as low as 38 percent. Breath tests have their own reliability problems with a high rate of false positive. Some doctors factor in a patients&#x27; response to treatment as part of the diagnosis.
Breath tests have been developed to test for bacterial overgrowth. These tests are either based on bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates to hydrogen, methane, or hydrogen sulfide, or based on the detection of by-products of digestion of carbohydrates that are not usually metabolized. The hydrogen breath test involves having the patient fast for a minimum of 12 hours then having them drink a substrate usually glucose or lactulose, then measuring expired hydrogen and methane concentrations typically over a period of several hours. It compares well to jejunal aspirates in making the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth. Carbon-13 (13C) and carbon-14 (14C) based tests have also been developed based on the bacterial metabolism of D-xylose. Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids. The glycocholic acid breath test involves the administration of the bile acid 14C glycocholic acid, and the detection of 14CO2, which would be elevated in bacterial overgrowth.

However, some physicians suggest that if the suspicion of bacterial overgrowth is high enough, the best diagnostic test is a trial of treatment. If the symptoms improve, an empiric diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth can be made.

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of inflammatory markers, such as fecal calprotectin, to detect SIBO.
===Definition===
SIBO may be defined as an increased number of bacteria measured via exhaled hydrogen and/or methane gas following the ingestion of glucose, or via analysis of small bowel aspirate fluid. Nevertheless, as of 2020, the definition of SIBO as a clinical entity lacks precision and consistency; it is a term generally applied to a clinical disorder where symptoms, clinical signs, and/or laboratory abnormalities are attributed to changes in the numbers of bacteria or in the composition of the bacterial population in the small intestine. The main obstacle to accurately define SIBO is limited understanding of the normal intestinal microbial population. Future advances in sampling technology and techniques for counting bacterial populations and their metabolites should provide much-needed clarity.
==== Methane-dominant SIBO ====
The archaeon &quot;Methanobrevibacter smithii&quot;, has been associated with symptoms of SIBO which result in a positive methane breath test. In addition to the archaeon, a few bacteria can also produce methane, such as members of the &quot;Clostridium&quot; and &quot;Bacteroides&quot; genus. Production of methane therefore, may not be bacterial, nor limited to the small intestine, and it has been proposed that the condition should be classified as a separate &#x27;intestinal methanogen overgrowth&#x27; (IMO).

==Treatment==
Treatment strategies should focus on identifying and correcting the root causes, where possible, resolving nutritional deficiencies, and administering antibiotics. This is especially important for patients with indigestion and malabsorption. Although whether antibiotics should be a first line treatment is a matter of debate. Some experts recommend probiotics as first line therapy with antibiotics being reserved as a second line treatment for more severe cases of SIBO. Prokinetic drugs are other options but research in humans is limited. A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, metronidazole, neomycin, cephalexin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of rifaximin, a poorly-absorbed antibiotic. Although irritable bowel syndrome has been shown to respond to the treatment of poorly-absorbed antibiotics, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of such treatment in cases of SIBO, and as of 2020, randomized controlled trials are still needed to further confirm the eradicating effect of such treatment in SIBO.
A course of one week of antibiotics is usually sufficient to treat the condition. However, if the condition recurs, antibiotics can be given in a cyclical fashion in order to prevent tolerance. For example, antibiotics may be given for a week, followed by three weeks off antibiotics, followed by another week of treatment. Alternatively, the choice of antibiotic used can be cycled. There is still limited data to guide the clinician in developing antibiotic strategies for SIBO. Therapy remains, for the most part, empiric. However, concerns exist about the potential risks of long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Probiotics are bacterial preparations that alter the bacterial flora in the bowel to cause a beneficial effect. Animal research has demonstrated that probiotics have barrier enhancing, antibacterial, immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects which may have a positive effect in the management of SIBO in humans. &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot; has been found to be effective in improving breath hydrogen scores after six weeks of treatment presumably by suppressing levels of a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth of fermenting bacteria. &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot;, and &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot; have all demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment and management of SIBO. Conversely, &quot;Lactobacillus fermentum&quot; and &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; have been found to be ineffective. A combination of &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&quot; has been found to be effective in suppressing bacterial overgrowth of abnormal gas producing organisms in the small intestine.

A combination of probiotic strains has been found to produce better results than therapy with the antibiotic drug metronidazole.

An elemental diet has been shown to be highly effective for eliminating SIBO with a two-week diet demonstrating 80% efficacy and a three-week diet demonstrating 85% efficacy. An elemental diet works via providing nutrition for the individual while depriving the bacteria of a food source. Additional treatment options include the use of prokinetic drugs such as 5-HT4 receptor agonists or motilin agonists to extend the SIBO free period after treatment with an elemental diet or antibiotics. A diet void of certain foods that feed the bacteria can help alleviate the symptoms. For example, if the symptoms are caused by bacterial overgrowth feeding on indigestible carbohydrate rich foods, following a FODMAP restriction diet may help.

<text>Primula&quot; sect. &quot;Dodecatheon is a section of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. &quot;Primula&quot; species in this section were formerly placed in a separate genus, Dodecatheon. The species have basal clumps of leaves and nodding flowers that are produced at the top of tall stems rising from where the leaves join the crown. The genus is largely confined to North America and part of northeastern Siberia. Common names include shooting star, American cowslip, mosquito bills, mad violets, and sailor caps. A few species are grown in gardens for their showy and unique flower display.

The stamens are thrust out with the sepals bent back. The flowers are pollinated by bees, which grab hold of the petals, and gather pollen by vibrating the flowers by buzzing their wings (buzz pollination). The vibration releases pollen from the anthers.

==Taxonomy==

Carl Linnaeus created the genus &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; could be distinguished by its buzz-pollinated flowers, with reflexed petals and projecting styles and anthers. Repeated molecular phylogenetic studies agreed with morphological and cytological evidence that &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; was most closely related to one of the subgenera of &quot;Primula&quot;, &quot;P.&quot; subgen. &quot;Auriculastrum&quot;, so that if &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; is kept separate from &quot;Primula&quot;, then &quot;Primula&quot; is not monophyletic. Accordingly, in 2007, Austin R. Mast and James L. Reveal reduced the genus &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; to &quot;Primula&quot; sect. &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; of &quot;P.&quot; subgen. &quot;Auriculastrum&quot;, and provided names in &quot;Primula&quot; for all former &quot;Dodecatheon&quot; species.

===Species===
17 &quot;Primula&quot; species are placed in &quot;Primula&quot; section &quot;Dodecatheon&quot;.
==Cultivation and uses==
Several species are found in cultivation, including &quot;Primula latiloba&quot; (&quot;Dodecatheon dentatum&quot;), &quot;Primula hendersonii&quot; (&quot;Dodecathon hendersonii&quot;) and &quot;Primula meadia&quot; (&quot;Dodecathon meadia&quot;).

Species of &quot;Primula&quot; sect. &quot;Dodecathon&quot; need good drainage and often dry soils in summer and winter when plants are dormant, in the spring plants like moist soils for best growth. Plants grown in dry soils tend to be smaller and lower growing. Since plants typically go summer dormant, seed raised plants need three or more years of growth before they are large enough to bloom. For some species, if given frequent light fertilization and kept moist, dormancy can be delayed resulting in larger plants after germination and the interval between germination and flowering decreased by a year or two. Another technique to shorten the interval between seed germination and flowering is to place the plants in a cooler after dormancy has set in, in late spring, and after a number of weeks move the plants to a shadehouse in midsummer where new growth will start. The flowers produce seeds via buzz pollination.

They can be propagated by division in winter.

Several varieties of the Pacific Northwest are edible.

<text>You Gotta Sin to Get Saved is the second album by the American singer-songwriter Maria McKee, released in 1993. The album includes two Van Morrison covers and a take on Goffin/King&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make It Alone&quot;. The first single was &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Soothe You&quot;, which peaked at No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart.

McKee, while promoting her third album, stated that she was unsatisfied with &quot;You Gotta Sin to Get Saved&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;Like much of this amazing, unexpected album, McKee splits her convictions between the music and the words, sinning and saving herself in a fission explosion that blasts into the spirit of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; concluded that &quot;languid backing by California session pros Jim Keltner, Benmont Tench et al, does nothing to spice up Maria&#x27;s clear voice, or tumbleweed &#x27;n&#x27; dust affairs.&quot; Johnny Dee of &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;good, occasionally inspired, stuff&quot; on which McKee &quot;adopts a heavily rootsical approach, mixing R&amp;B, country and Southern soul into a melancholic rock pot&quot;. He said it contained &quot;all handsome songs&quot;, but felt it was McKee&#x27;s &quot;stunning delivery that really charms&quot;, writing, &quot;McKee&#x27;s voice torches each song with deep melancholic melody and her band mirror this beautifully, tinting everything with a richly soulful brush.&quot; He concluded, &quot;An unreservedly retro and indulgent album, but a valuable one nonetheless. If there&#x27;s a space in your record collection between the Black Crowes and the Jayhawks, [this] will plug that gap amply.&quot; Ian Gittins of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described the album as &quot;no disgrace&quot;, but felt that it &quot;still falls inevitably short of the sacred heights she scales live&quot;. He considered George Drakoulias&#x27; production to be &quot;partly the problem&quot;, with the tracks &quot;riddled with parping brass and cheesy keyboards&quot;, and added that the music is &quot;frequently lame&quot; and &quot;spirited belters are few&quot;. He concluded, &quot;The LP&#x27;s &quot;forte [being] shoulder-heaving, wrenched ballads, sepia laments, yet McKee never sounds truly wracked or at her best. The live shows may see McKee soar again, but here is a girl nowhere near her volcano.&quot;

<text>Mekelle (), or Mek&#x27;ele, is a special zone and capital of the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Mekelle was formerly the capital of Enderta awraja in Tigray. It is located around north of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, with an elevation of above sea level. Administratively, Mekelle is considered a Special Zone, which is divided into seven sub-cities. It is the economic, cultural, and political hub of northern Ethiopia.

Mekelle has grown rapidly since 1991 with a population of 61,000 in 1984, 97,000 inhabitants in 1994 (96.5% being Tigrinya-speakers), and 170,000 in 2006 (i.e. 4% of the population of Tigray). Mekelle is the second-largest city in Ethiopia after Addis Ababa, with a population of around 545,000. It is 4 times larger than Adigrat, the second-largest regional center. The majority of the population of Mekelle depends on government employment, commerce, and small-scale enterprises. In 2007, Mekelle had new engineering, cement, and textile factories, producing for the local and foreign markets. Mekelle University developed out of the pre-1991 Arid Agricultural College, and about a dozen other governmental and private colleges were created.

==History==
===Origins===
Mekelle is believed to have evolved from a 13th-century hamlet called Enda Meseqel (later Enda Medhane Alem), becoming a town by the early 19th century, when &quot;ras&quot; Wolde Selassie of Enderta made Antalo his seat of power, and the region of Mekelle ( to the north) his recreational center. In the tax records of &quot;atse&quot; Tewodros II, Mekelle appears as a tributary district within Enderta with a &quot;negarit&quot; of its own.

=== 19th century ===
The credit for Mekelle&#x27;s growth into a regional capital goes to &quot;atse&quot; Yohannes IV who made Mekelle political capital of his expanding state. He must have chosen the place for its strategic proximity both to rich agricultural areas (of Raya Azebo) and to the Afar salt country. Mekelle&#x27;s position on the route to Shewa, the power base of Yohannes&#x27;s main rival Menelik could have been another factor. Three institutions still important for modern Mekelle were founded by Yohannes. The grand palace built in 1882–84 by the Italian architect Giacomo Naretti forms the historic center of Mekelle. The large market Edaga Senuy (&quot;Monday Market&quot;). The church, at Debre Gennet Medhane Alem, built after the return from Raya Azebo campaign in 1871.

In the 1880s, Mekelle became Ethiopia&#x27;s capital city. Among the factors that further accelerated Mekele&#x27;s growth and urbanization were the establishment of residential quarters by the &quot;nobility&quot; and court servants, the prominence of the &quot;amole&quot; salt market and the subsequent establishment of local and foreign trading and occupational communities, and Mekelle&#x27;s strategic position as a transit center for commodities of the long-distance trade routes of northeastern Ethiopia, attached to the Red Sea ports, and to northern and central Ethiopia. By establishing a market in Mekelle, Yohannes could draw on the northern trade routes as well as the salt caravan routes to the town, capitalizing on his political leverage.

The succession of &quot;atse&quot; Menelik II of Shewa signaled a trading reorientation from northern to southern Ethiopia (centered in Shewa). The new capital Addis Ababa quickly outstripped Mekelle, which, however, retained its political importance as the district and regional administration center of Enderta and Tigray respectively through the 20th century, and its economic role in the Ethiopian salt trade.

During the Italian War of 1895–96, Mekelle became an important site in the conflict. After the fall of Adwa in spring 1895, &quot;ras&quot; Mengasha Yohannes retreated from his father&#x27;s capital Mekelle following the advice of &quot;atse&quot; Menelik II. Mekelle was occupied by the Italians without a shot and integrated into the &quot;Colonia Eritrea&quot;; from here the Italians extended their occupation south, up to Ambalage. The Italian army established their fort near the Enda Eyesus church above Mekelle in October 1895. After the re-occupation of Ambalage in late 1895, the fort was besieged by Ethiopian troops, who cut the Italians&#x27; water supply. When the Italians surrendered in January 1896, Menelik allowed them to retreat to their stronghold Adigrat, probably hoping to prevent an escalation of the conflict, and he appointed his own governor over Enderta at Mekelle, &quot;dejazmach&quot; Tedla Abaguben, in order to check the rebellious Tigrayan princes.

=== 20th century ===
Three historical epochs sustained Mekelle&#x27;s urbanization in the 20th century. The first was the advent of &quot;dejazmach&quot; Abreha Araya Demtsu, governor of Eastern Tigray with Mekelle as his capital. Abreha imitated his cousin Yohannes by establishing his own splendid palace (now the Hotel called Abreha Castle) on a hill facing the grand palace, a new Saturday Market (Edaga Senbet), and a new church, Selassie, all of which were situated to the south of Mekelle proper. Likewise, he attracted various occupational groups including Muslim traders, women service vendors, and army retainers. Consequently, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Mekelle witnessed a remarkable growth in trade. &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Haile Selassie Gugsa renovated the Palace in the center to use it as his seat.

The second phase occurred during the Italian occupation (1935–41). The Italians, who occupied the town in November 1935, contributed considerably to its modernization. They built a military airport and a fort at Enda Eyesus (now the main compound of Mekelle University); reorganized roads, telephone lines, offices and residences; and installed modern water pipelines, electricity, clinics, postal services, cinema hall and resort/sport centers. They also expanded Edaga Senbet by introducing corrugated iron shops. This also attracted foreign entrepreneurs (Greeks, Arabs and Armenians). Mekelle, then divided into two zones; Italian and Native, grew about twice its former size. In 1938, there were shops, two Italian-style restaurants and Hotel Amba Aradam with four rooms. There were post, telephone, and telegraph offices, and a hospital. An important market was held on Mondays.

Starting from May 1943, Mekelle was in the hands of the leaders of the Woyane rebellion against the then weak restored Haile Selassie government. British air bombardment of the town of September–October caused heavy damage. In October Mekelle was recaptured by the Ethiopian government forces.

The third phase in Mekelle&#x27;s urban development took place mainly during 1942–74. Modern urban sectors were diversified, and new administrative offices were established. The Mekelle municipality (founded 1942), telecommunications and post office, Commercial Bank and the &quot;atse&quot; Yohannes Elementary (in 1952) and Secondary School (in 1960) were established. The master plan was issued in 1962. Small-scale enterprises such as oil refineries, soap mills, leather and caning bags, costumes and flour mills were established until 1974. Most of the industrial establishments, however, have declined, degraded or closed during the Ethiopian Civil War (1974-1991).

During the 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, Mekelle was notorious for the seven &quot;hunger camps&quot; around the city. These housed 75,000 refugees with 20,000 more waiting to enter. During March 1985, 50 to 60 people died in these seven camps every day. In February 1986, the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) released 1,800 political prisoners from the Mekelle prison in a daring military action. The operation was named &quot;Agazi,&quot; after one of the founding fighters of the TPLF, who had been killed in the second year of the Ethiopian Civil War.

In a series of offensives launched on 25 February 1988, TPLF fighters bypassed Mekelle but took control of Maychew, Korem and other places along the Dessie-Mekelle road. By June 1988, TPLF controlled all of Tigray except the city of Mekelle and the territory a radius of around the city. In response, the Derg had a number of villages around Mekelle burned on June 4 and 5, which included Addi Gera, Bahri, Goba Zena, Grarot, Issala, and Rabea. It was not until 25 February 1989 that Mekelle was also occupied by the TPLF, after the government position in Tigray had collapsed. Near the end of the civil war, Mekelle was bombed by the Ethiopian Air Force on 27 and 29 October 1989, resulting in the deaths of at least 31 people.

On 5 June 1998, the Eritrean Air Force bombed Ayder School in Mekelle during the Eritrean–Ethiopian War killing twelve. A monument pays respects to this tragedy.

=== 21st century ===

On 29 December 2002, a riot broke out between Ethiopian Orthodox and Adventist worshippers, over an Adventist prayer service being conducted in a stadium. Some Ethiopian Orthodox believers, upset by the display of public Adventist preaching, reportedly sparked the clashes by first throwing stones at Adventists gathered in the stadium, then by looting Adventist offices in the city. Police intervened to break up the riots, which resulted in five dead and three seriously injured. The police reported that 10 people were detained, but independent sources reported that the number was much larger.

The United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) headquarters was established in Mekelle in 2000 following the end of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War and continued until 30 July 2008.

During the Tigray War, attacks were carried out on Mekelle by joint Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, including aerial bombardments. On 19 December 2020, an EEPA report stated that Eritrean soldiers were in Mekelle, according to a resident and two diplomats receiving information from the ground. They stated that some soldiers were wearing Eritrean uniforms, whilst others wore Ethiopian uniforms but &quot;spoke Tigrinya with an Eritrean accent and drove trucks without license plates.&quot; On 19 December 2020, there were multiple reports that the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) were looting property from the Sur Company in Mekelle and transporting the loot to Addis Ababa. On the same day, police and TPLF absence led to lawlessness in Mekelle. Youth were especially targeted by ENDF soldiers. Civil servants in Mekelle were ordered back to work by the Transitional Government of Tigray; few reported to work. On 20 December 2020, witnesses from Mekelle stated that artillery shelling had taken place before 28 November. The shelling destroyed houses in residential areas and killed civilians. In one case, a whole family was killed, leaving only a little boy alive. A doctor said that he personally saw 22 bodies. It was hard to take proper care of those wounded by the artillery due to a critical shortage of medical supplies. Four planned Ethiopian Airlines flights from Addis Ababa to Mekelle were cancelled on 20 December. On 21 December 2020, Federal Police Crime Prevention Sector Head, Deputy Commissioner General Melaku Fanta, told local media in Mekelle that arrest warrants have been issued against anyone who collaborated with the TPLF. On 28 June 2021 Mekelle was recaptured by the Tigray Defense Forces.

==Geography==
Mekelle lies at an elevation of above sea level (at the airport), close to the edge of the northern portion of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, on a Jurassic limestone plateau, in a semi-arid area with a mean annual rainfall of . 
Except for a moderately dense eucalyptus cover on the hills in eastern edges of Mekelle and some exotic species of trees and shrubs lining the streets, the surrounding landscape is almost treeless.

== Cityscape ==

The Tigray Martyrs Memorial Monument pays respects to the over 60,000 TPLF fighters who died and over 100,000 fighters who were injured in the overthrow of the Marxist Derg regime in 1991. The monument is tall and is located in Adi-Haki sub-city. The monument has many sculptures depicting the struggle of the peasants and fighters against the Derg soldiers.

Emperor Yohannes IV in the 19th century became Negus and built a castle and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo churches in the city. The castle was constructed by Ethiopian engineer &quot;Lij&quot; Ingidashet and Italian engineer Giacomo Naretti. The castle complex now serves as a museum where the Emperor&#x27;s throne, royal bed, ceremonial dress, rifles, and many other valuable historical collections can be seen.

Other notable landmarks include the churches Enda Gabir, Enda Yesus Mekelle Bete Mengist, Mekelle Iyesus, Mekelle Maryam, Mekelle Selassie, Enda Mariam Bugsa and Mekelle Tekle Haymanot.

=== Sub-cities ===
Mekelle is divided into seven local administrations: Hawelti, Adi-Haki, Kedamay Weyane, Hadnet, Ayder, Semien and Quiha. Within each local administration there are &quot;kebeles&quot; or &quot;ketenas&quot;. The subcities of Mekelle comprise the area formerly incorporated as Mekelle City. While falling under the jurisdiction of Mekele Special Zone Government, each subcity is also a borough with its own administrator, like other cities of Ethiopia. These officials oversee socio-economic development and run health, education, and utilities.

The sub-cities differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the regional government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Mekelle Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The &quot;three central sub-cities&quot; of Mekelle – Kedamay Weyane, Ayder and Hawelti – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Semien is unique occupied by many major factories. It is often called the &quot;economic center&quot; of the Tigray.

Mekelle special zone has been represented in the House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives by Addis Alem Balema since 2005.

== Climate ==
The climate in this area is characterized by moderately warm temperatures year-round and distinct wet and dry seasons. The Köppen type for this climate is cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;); however it borders on both a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) and a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;).

<doc id="1221565" wikidata="Q129265" url="?curid=1221565" title="Junior (1994 film)">
<text>Junior is a 1994 American comedy film directed and produced by Ivan Reitman, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito and Emma Thompson. The film follows Alex Hesse, an Austrian-American scientist who agrees to undergo a male pregnancy from a newly developed drug Expectane.

The film was released in the United States the day before Thanksgiving on November 23, 1994, to mixed reception and did not match the box office performance of Reitman&#x27;s earlier films starring Schwarzenegger: 1988&#x27;s &quot;Twins&quot;, which also starred DeVito and Schwarzenegger as a comedic duo, and 1990&#x27;s &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot;. Schwarzenegger and Thompson received Golden Globe Award nominations for their performances. The film&#x27;s theme song, Patty Smyth&#x27;s &quot;Look What Love Has Done&quot; was also recognized, going on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Plot==
Austrian research geneticist Dr. Alex Hesse and his OB/GYN colleague Dr. Larry Arbogast invent a fertility drug, &quot;Expectane&quot;, designed to reduce the chances of a miscarriage. With the drug unapproved by the FDA, the colleagues are unable to test the drug and cannot continue their research. Head of the review board Noah Banes informs Larry that while the FDA denied human experimentation, the team has received a donation from geneticist Dr. Diana Reddin from the ovum cryogenics department.

Alex plans to start over in Europe, but Larry suggests they can still perform the experiment, with Canadian firm Lyndon Pharmaceutical offering to fund them provided they find a volunteer. Alex questions the likelihood of a pregnant woman taking an unapproved drug, but Larry suggests omitting the volunteer&#x27;s gender and convinces him to impregnate himself with an ovum codenamed &quot;Junior&quot;.

That night, Alex dreams his potential offspring has his own face. As weeks go by, he complains to Larry of sore nipples, and chats incessantly about walks, massages, and naps. Contemplating fatherhood after watching television commercials, Alex breaks down sobbing. When the time comes for Alex to end the experiment and release the results to Lyndon Pharmaceutical, he continues taking the drug and decides to carry the pregnancy to term; initially annoyed, Larry agrees to keep it hidden. Alex develops a relationship with Diana, and reveals his pregnancy to Angela, Larry&#x27;s ex-wife, who also happens to be pregnant by Aerosmith&#x27;s personal trainer.

Diana is stunned and angry when it is revealed that the &quot;Junior&quot; ovum is hers, and Banes attempts to take credit for the experiment. Disguised as a woman, Alex hides in a retreat for expectant mothers, blaming his masculine appearance on anabolic steroid use. Diana visits, telling him it does not matter who is pregnant because he is the father and she is the mother. Larry reveals the experiment&#x27;s data to Lyndon Pharmaceutical, who agree to partner with them.

Alex experiences abdominal pain from the start of labor, calling for Larry and Diana. As Diana rushes to the resort, Larry tells a fellow doctor to prepare for an emergency c-section. A hospital staffer overhears and alerts Banes, who summons the media and the University Dean, hoping to take credit for the world&#x27;s first pregnant man. Warned by a colleague, Larry creates a decoy for Alex to allow a private c-section. When Larry arrives, the news media only see the pregnant Angela, discrediting Banes, who is fired by the Dean. Diana and Alex enter the hospital by the fire escape, and he has an emergency c-section. Sent to keep Angela company in the waiting room, Diana finds her in labor and becomes her delivery coach. Alex gives birth to a healthy baby girl, and Larry announces the arrival to Diana, who is assisting Angela with contractions. Diana leaves Angela with Larry and rushes to see the baby, whom she and Alex name Junior. Larry delivers Angela&#x27;s child and they reconcile to raise the boy, Jake, as their own.

One year later, the families all go on vacation together and celebrate the birthdays of Junior and Jake. Diana is pregnant with their second child, and Angela mentions wanting another baby but not wishing to endure pregnancy again; they all try to convince a reluctant Larry to carry the child.

==Production==
Originally developed under the title of &quot;Oh Baby&quot;, the film was announced during production of Reitman&#x27;s &quot;Dave&quot; as a reteam for him and Schwarzenegger.

Executive producer Beverly J. Camhe and writers Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad wrote the script together in 1990 over the course of just under a year with the central concept of &quot;What if men could have babies?&quot; stemming from their experience in Jungian therapy as a possible way of reconciling Yin and yang. The two shopped the script around to various potential leads, but in many cases agents outright refused to give it to their clients and several who did were allegedly disgusted with the concept. Mel Gibson came close to signing on for the role, but pulled out after learning of his church&#x27;s stance on the material. Woody Harrelson also responded well to the script, but the studio didn&#x27;t think he had enough clout to carry audience interest. Andrew Dice Clay&#x27;s agent also called regarding the script suggesting it could be a good revenge fantasy for those who took umbrage with Clay&#x27;s misogynistic humor, but Wade and Conrad shot down this idea as they didn&#x27;t want schadenfreude to color the movie. When the project made its way to Schwarzenegger, both he and his then wife Maria Shriver loved the script and were instrumental in getting the film set up.

Thompson signed to star in February 1994, following her Academy Award nominations for &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; and &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Following the successful collaborations between Schwarzenegger and Reitman on &quot;Twins&quot; (1988) which grossed $217 million worldwide and &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990) which grossed $202 million, Variety&#x27;s Leonard Klady predicted that the film, which opened the day before Thanksgiving, would be the biggest of the season. The film was the biggest to open over the Thanksgiving weekend with a gross of $10 million in 3 days, but was only placed fourth overall for the weekend with just half the gross of &quot;The Santa Clause&quot;. In North America, the film did not perform as expected and only grossed slightly more than half its budget ($37 million vs. $60 million) but grossed a total of $108 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 39% approval rating with an average score of 5/10, based on 36 collected reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Even with an abundance of talent behind and in front of the camera, &quot;Junior&quot; doesn&#x27;t quite deliver enough laughs to nurse its zany high-concept idea.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 59% based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert was a fan of the film, giving it 3½ out of four stars and maintaining that: &quot;I know this sounds odd, but Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role. Observe his acting carefully in &quot;Junior&quot;, and you&#x27;ll see skills that many &#x27;serious&#x27; actors could only envy.&quot; On the television show &quot;At the Movies&quot; Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film &quot;two thumbs up&quot;.
Variety wrote: &quot;What separates this straightforward chuckler from the pack is its shrewd reliance on character rather than plot, and that human dimension proves surprisingly poignant.&quot;

Comedian and former &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; host Michael J. Nelson named the film the second-worst comedy ever made.

<text>The Avenue Road Church is a former church building in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 243 Avenue Road, on the northeastern corner of Roxborough Avenue.

Originally the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, it became the Avenue Road Presbyterian Church then the Avenue Road United Church, and later the Church of the Nazarene. The building now serves as the Toronto Hare Krishna Temple (ISKCON Toronto).

==History==
Designed in the Gothic Revival style by Gordon &amp; Helliwell and built in 1899, the building was initially the Church of the Covenant. It was renamed the Avenue Road Presbyterian Church around 1908. The Presbyterian congregation joined the United Church of Canada in 1925, thus the church became the Avenue Road United Church.

The church was vacant for several years until Charles Templeton took possession of the church as preacher in 1941. Templeton founded the church as an independent congregation. Templeton and his wife decided to rent the empty building for $100 a month, even without a congregation. Under his leadership, the new independent congregation grew until Templeton went into debt to pay for the construction of a balcony to accommodate their larger numbers. It was soon after the balcony was completed that the structure was severely damaged by fire, in 1944. The building was repaired through donations from supporters across Canada and the United States. The church later became associated with the Christian and Missionary Alliance denomination, after becoming the Church of the Nazarene.

In the mid-1970s, the growing congregation left the downtown area to found the Bayview Glen Church in Thornhill, Ontario. During the congregation&#x27;s move, there was controversy surrounding the sale of the church building to a buyer who represented a Hare Krishna group. After the demolition permit was denied, it has since become Canada&#x27;s largest Hare Krishna place of worship.

<text>Fernbank Museum of Natural History, in Atlanta, Georgia, is a museum that presents exhibitions and programming about natural history. Fernbank Museum has a number of permanent exhibitions and regularly hosts temporary exhibitions in its expansive facility, designed by Graham Gund Architects. &quot;Giants of the Mesozoic&quot;, on display in the atrium of Fernbank Museum, features a long &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot;, the largest dinosaur ever classified; as well as a &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. The permanent exhibition, &quot;A Walk Through Time in Georgia&quot;, tells the twofold story of Georgia&#x27;s natural history and the development of the planet. Fernbank Museum has won several national and international awards for one of its newest permanent exhibitions, Fernbank NatureQuest, an immersive, interactive exhibition for children that was designed and produced by Thinkwell Group. The awards NatureQuest has won include the 2012 Thea Award for Outstanding Achievement for a Museum Exhibit and the 2011 Bronze Award for Best Museum Environment from Event Design. The nearby Fernbank Science Center is a separate organization operated by the DeKalb County Board of Education and is not affiliated with Fernbank Museum of Natural History (Fernbank, Inc.).

==History==
In the late 1800s, a nature-lover named Emily Harrison grew up in an area east of Atlanta which she called &quot;Fernbank&quot;. Along with others, Harrison created a charter for Fernbank in 1938 and purchased the of woodland on which Fernbank Museum now stands. In 1964, the Fernbank trustees and the DeKalb County School System created Fernbank Science Center, which led to a desire to share Fernbank&#x27;s resources with the general public.

Following master planning and designs by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based architectural firm, Graham Gund Architects, ground was broken in 1989, and on October 5, 1992, Fernbank Museum of Natural History opened to the public. The new building is carefully located behind a row of historic houses, and features a glass-enclosed atrium overlooking Fernbank Forest. Fernbank Museum now stands on of the largest old-growth urban Piedmont forest in the country.

== Exhibits ==
Fernbank Museum offers a variety of exhibits exploring many different natural history topics. Exhibits include:
* Fernbank NatureQuest
* Dinosaur Plaza
* Giants of the Mesozoic
* A Walk Through Time in Georgia
* Reflections of Culture
* Conveyed in Clay: Stories from St. Catherines Island
* Our Favorite Things
* World of Shells
* Fantastic Forces
* Sky High
* Star Gallery
* STEAM Lab
The museum also has an area where special exhibitions are cycled through. These exhibits tend to stay open to the public for 2–4 months each.

=== Outdoor exhibits ===
In 2016, the museum opened WildWoods, an accessible 10-acre area located directly behind the museum with trails and interactive exhibits. In 2016 Fernbank also opened access to the newly restored, 65-acre Fernbank Forest.

==Giant screen theatre==
Fernbank is home to the Rankin M. Smith, Sr. Giant Screen Theater. Formerly an IMAX theater, upgrades were completed in February 2017 including a digital 4K 3D laser-illuminated projection system.

==Special programming==
Fernbank puts on special activities for adults and children including camps, lectures, workshops, interactive conversations, family activity days, and storytelling.

One of Fernbank&#x27;s most popular events, &quot;Fernbank After Dark&quot; runs the second Friday of each month and features hands-on educational activities, drinks, food and live music.

=== FYI Volunteer Program ===
Fernbank Museum offers a year-round volunteer program for teens aged 13–17. FYI (Fernbank Youth Interpreter) Volunteers interact with museum guests while working on educational carts throughout the museum, exploring a wide range of natural history topics, including Archaeology, Paleontology, Anatomy, and more.

<doc id="1221571" wikidata="Q1248527" url="?curid=1221571" title="Rescorla–Wagner model">
<text>The Rescorla–Wagner model (&quot;R-W&quot;) is a model of classical conditioning, in which learning is conceptualized in terms of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli. A strong CS-US association means that the CS signals predict the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the blocking effect. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.

The Rescorla–Wagner model was created by Yale psychologists Robert A. Rescorla and Allan R. Wagner in 1972.

==Basic assumptions of the model==
#The change in the association between a CS and a US that occurs when the two are paired depends on how strongly the US is predicted on that trial - that is, informally, how &quot;surprised&quot; the organism is by the US. The amount of this &quot;surprise&quot; depends on the summed associative strength of all cues present during that trial. In contrast, previous models derived the change in associative strength from the current value of the CS alone.
#The associative strength of a CS is represented by a single number. The association is excitatory if the number is positive, inhibitory if it is negative. 
#The associative strength of a stimulus is expressed directly by the behavior it elicits/inhibits. 
#The salience of a CS (alpha in the equation) and the strength of the US (beta) are constants and do not change during training.
#Only the current associative strength of a cue determines its effect on behavior and the amount of learning it supports. It does not matter how that strength value was arrived at, whether by simple conditioning, reconditioning, or otherwise.
The first two assumptions were new in the Rescorla–Wagner model. The last three assumptions were present in previous models and are less crucial to the R-W model&#x27;s novel predictions.

==Equation==
:formula_1

and
:formula_2

where
* formula_3 is the change in the strength, on a single trial, of the association between the CS labelled &quot;X&quot; and the US
* formula_4 is the salience of X (bounded by 0 and 1)
* formula_5 is the rate parameter for the US (bounded by 0 and 1), sometimes called its association value
* formula_6 is the maximum conditioning possible for the US
* formula_7 is the current associative strength of X
* formula_8 is the total associative strength of all stimuli present, that is, X plus any others
==The revised RW model by Van Hamme and Wasserman (1994)==
Van Hamme and Wasserman have extended the original Rescorla–Wagner (RW) model and introduced a new factor in their revised RW model in 1994: They suggested that not only conditioned stimuli physically present on a given trial can undergo changes in their associative strength, the associative value of a CS can also be altered by a within-compound-association with a CS present on that trial. A within-compound-association is established if two CSs are presented together during training (compound stimulus). If one of the two component CSs is subsequently presented alone, then it is assumed to activate a representation of the other (previously paired) CS as well. Van Hamme and Wasserman propose that stimuli indirectly activated through within-compound-associations have a negative learning parameter—thus phenomena of retrospective reevaluation can be explained.

Consider the following example, an experimental paradigm called &quot;backward blocking,&quot; indicative of retrospective revaluation, where AB is the compound stimulus A+B:
* Phase 1: AB–US 
* Phase 2: A–US

Test trials: Group 1, which received both Phase 1- and 2-trials, elicits a weaker conditioned response (CR) to B compared to the Control group, which only received Phase 1-trials.

The original RW model cannot account for this effect. But the revised model can: In Phase 2, stimulus B is indirectly activated through within-compound-association with A. But instead of a positive learning parameter (usually called alpha) when physically present, during Phase 2, B has a negative learning parameter. Thus during the second phase, B&#x27;s associative strength declines whereas A&#x27;s value increases because of its positive learning parameter.

Thus, the revised RW model can explain why the CR elicited by B after backward blocking training is weaker compared with AB-only conditioning.

==Some failures of the RW model==
;Spontaneous recovery from extinction and recovery from extinction caused by reminder treatments (reinstatement)
:It is a well-established observation that a time-out interval after completion of extinction results in partial recovery from extinction, i.e., the previously extinguished reaction or response recurs—but usually at a lower level than before extinction training. Reinstatement refers to the phenomenon that exposure to the US from training alone after completion of extinction results in partial recovery from extinction. The RW model can&#x27;t account for those phenomena.

;Extinction of a previously conditioned inhibitor
:The RW model predicts that repeated presentation of a conditioned inhibitor alone (a CS with negative associative strength) results in extinction of this stimulus (a decline of its negative associative value). This is a false prediction. Contrarily, experiments show the repeated presentation of a conditioned inhibitor alone even increases its inhibitory potential

;Facilitated reacquisition after extinction
:One of the assumptions of the model is that the history of conditioning of a CS does not have any influences on its present status—only its current associative value is important. Contrary to this assumption, many experiments show that stimuli that were first conditioned and then extinguished are more easily reconditioned (i.e., fewer trials are necessary for conditioning).

;The exclusiveness of excitation and inhibition
:The RW model also assumes that and inhibition are opponent features. A stimulus can either have excitatory potential (a positive associative strength) or inhibitory potential (a negative associative strength), but not both. By contrast it is sometimes observed, that stimuli can have both qualities. One example is backward excitatory conditioning in which a CS is backwardly paired with a US (US–CS instead of CS–US). This usually makes the CS become a conditioned excitor. The stimulus also has inhibitory features which can be proven by the retardation of acquisition test. This test is used to assess the inhibitory potential of a stimulus since it is observed that excitatory conditioning with a previously conditioned inhibitor is retarded. The backwardly conditioned stimulus passes this test and thus seems to have both excitatory and inhibitory features.

;Pairing a novel stimulus with a conditioned inhibitor
:A conditioned inhibitor is assumed to have a negative associative value. By presenting an inhibitor with a novel stimulus (i.e., its associative strength is zero), the model predicts that the novel cue should become a conditioned excitor. This is not the case in experimental situations. The predictions of the model stem from its basic term (lambda-V). Since the summed associative strength of all stimuli (V) present on the trial is negative (zero + inhibitory potential) and lambda is zero (no US present), the resulting change in the associative strength is positive, thus making the novel cue a conditioned excitor.

;CS-preexposure effect
:The CS-preexposure effect (also called latent inhibition) is the well-established observation that conditioning after exposure to the stimulus later used as the CS in conditioning is retarded. The RW model doesn&#x27;t predict any effect of presenting a novel stimulus without a US.

;Higher-order conditioning
:In higher-order conditioning a previously conditioned CS is paired with a novel cue (i.e., first CS1–US then CS2–CS1). This usually makes the novel cue CS2 elicit similar reactions to the CS1. The model cannot account for this phenomenon since during CS2–CS1 trials, no US is present. But by allowing CS1 to act similarly to a US, one can reconcile the model with this effect.

;Sensory preconditioning
:Sensory preconditioning refers to first pairing two novel cues (CS1–CS2) and then pairing one of them with a US (CS2–US). This turns both CS1 and CS2 into conditioned excitors. The RW model cannot explain this, since during the CS1–CS2-phase both stimuli have an associative value of zero and lambda is also zero (no US present) which results in no change in the associative strength of the stimuli.

==Success and popularity==
The Rescorla–Wagner model owes its success to several factors, including
*it has relatively few free parameters and independent variables
*it can generate clear and ordinal predictions
*it has made a number of successful predictions
*cast in such terms as &quot;prediction&quot; and &quot;surprise&quot;, the model has intuitive appeal
*it has generated a great deal of research, including many new findings and alternative theories

<doc id="1221573" wikidata="Q6544882" url="?curid=1221573" title="Life Is Sweet (album)">
<text>Life Is Sweet is the third album by American singer-songwriter Maria McKee, released in 1996.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; praised the first single, &quot;Absolutely Barking Stars&quot;, stating &quot;get ready for the new and improved McKee. The over-the-top howl of past recordings has been replaced by a more restrained, warmly
shaded vocal style that explores a surprisingly strong lower range. The raw emotion is still there, but it&#x27;s unleashed in spurts and displayed as much in the instrumentation as it is in her singing. This first single from &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; is a spare rock ballad that combines urgent guitars with Phil Spector-styled strings. Uniquely beautiful and challenging.&quot;

&quot;Cashbox&quot; noted that &quot;McKee has long had one of the most unique and evocative voices in music. The former singer for Lone Justice has made significant changes on her new disc, &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;, an edgier, more dramatic collection of material than her previous down-home roots have indicated...On
&quot;Absolutely Barking Stars,&quot; the first single, she’s joined by strings and a shimmering, al-most orchestral arrangement that crisscrosses with jangly percussive syncopation while McKee’s voice soars and vibrates in between, culminating in a high-drama crescendo.&quot;

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album &quot;a bold departure from her trademark sound, taking her into new sonic territories. Although the loud, distorted guitars are the first noticeable change, it soon becomes apparent that the thing that makes the album sound so different is its latent progressive rock influences. Throughout the album, McKee weaves complex, layered arrangements that interweave strings, guitars, and keyboards...with its art rock tendencies and naked ambition, &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; may not appeal to fans who have become attached to McKee&#x27;s country-rock. For those willing to accept her pretensions, it is a frustrating but rewarding album.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that the album &quot;goes straight over the top in a bewildering styleless hodgepodge of bad production ideas, bizarre gimmicks (paraphrasing melodies and rhythm guitar sounds from &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;?), uneven writing and singing so mindlessly zealous in spots that McKee can’t possibly be hearing herself.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought that &quot;McKee&#x27;s songs are sometimes swamped by the ornate arrangements, but her wide-ranging vocals are consistently expressive.&quot;

<doc id="1221577" wikidata="Q211766" url="?curid=1221577" title="Lot (river)">
<text>The Lot (), originally the Olt (; ), is a river in France. It is a right-bank tributary of the Garonne. It rises in the Cévennes mountains, flowing west through Quercy, where it flows into the Garonne near Aiguillon, a total distance of . It gives its name to the &quot;départements&quot; of Lot and Lot-et-Garonne.

The Lot is prone to flooding in the winter and spring, and has many dams in its upper catchment area, mainly on the Truyère, which produce hydroelectric power of strategic importance for the French national grid. Turbining can cause additional variations in flow throughout the 275 km of the river that has been extensively developed as an asset for tourism in the region. The major project to restore navigability of the river Lot was conceived by local stakeholders in Decazeville and Cahors in the 1970s. It meant restoring the many locks, and bypassing the medium-head dams built at five locations along the former waterway.
Olt is also the name of a river in Romania (; ; or &quot;&quot;, , &quot;Alytos&quot;).
==Main tributaries==
* Lède (near Villeneuve-sur-Lot)
* Célé (near Cabrerets)
* Dourdou de Conques (in Grand-Vabre)
* Truyère (in Entraygues-sur-Truyère)
* Colagne (in Le Monastier-Pin-Moriès)

==Departments and towns==
The Lot flows through the following départements and towns: Lozère (Mende), Cantal, Aveyron (Entraygues-sur-Truyère, Flagnac, Capdenac-Gare), Lot (Cahors) and Lot-et-Garonne (Villeneuve-sur-Lot, Aiguillon).

==Navigation==
From the Middle Ages flat-bottomed &quot;gabarres&quot; traded between Entraygues and the Garonne, a distance of 297 km. In the late 17th century Jean-Baptiste Colbert ordered improvements to navigation. A second phase of canalisation became necessary when the open-cast coal mines in Decazeville started supplying coal to fuel the industrial revolution, from 1840. About 75 weirs (&quot;chaussées&quot;) and locks were built over the 270 km up to Bouquiès near Decazeville. Barges continued to ply the river after the first railway was opened from Montauban to Capdenac in 1858. Canals were then built to bypass the river’s meanders at Luzech, Cajarc, Montbrun and Capdenac. The short reprieve for river navigation came to end when the railway was opened along the valley in sections from 1869. The navigation was abandoned in 1926. An association was founded by Christian Bernad in 1971 to promote restoration for tourism. A study to assess the feasibility of developing waterway tourism on the river was undertaken in 1985-86, and led to the first 64 km length being restored and opened in 1990. The Lot is now open to recreational navigation and passenger boats in three sections, with long-term plans to interconnect them currently floundering for lack of political support and funding.

===The Lower River Lot===
The lower river Lot is a 120 km (74.5 mi) route from Nicole to Albas, currently with 17 locks restored, but a gap of 3 km from PK 76-79, where one lock remains to be restored, and a lock or other structure to bypass the dam at Fumel. Development of boat traffic on the river has been affected by poor conditions of navigation on the Garonne, to be crossed over a length of 5 km to gain access to the entrance lock at Nicole.

===The Central River Lot===
This central river Lot is a 74 km (46 mi) route, with 17 locks, from Luzech to Larnagol. The length originally reopened in May 1990 was 64 km long, to Crégols above Saint-Cirq-Lapopie. It was extended in 2008.

===The Upper River Lot===
The upper river Lot is a short length of 11 km (7 mi) in the département Aveyron, from la Roque-Bouillac in the commune of Livinhac-le-Haut to Port d&#x27;Agrès in the commune of Saint-Parthem, including two restored locks and a completely new lock beside the hydroelectric plant at Marcenac.

The industrial history of the river weighs heavily on today&#x27;s development, since pollution has left heavy metals in the silt at locations such as Fumel (Lower Lot) and Bouillac (Upper Lot). Costly processes are required to remove these sediments, as a prerequisite for continuing restoration works on the river. The current situation with the three separate navigable sections is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.

<doc id="1221578" wikidata="Q1029883" url="?curid=1221578" title="Primula hendersonii">
<text>Primula hendersonii is a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae, native to western North America, from California north to southern British Columbia and Idaho. Common names include broad-leaved shooting star, Henderson&#x27;s shooting star, mosquito bills, and sailor caps.

==Description==
&quot;P. hendersonii&quot; is summer deciduous, dying back to the ground after the rains cease. It has basal clumps of leaves, 2–16 cm, with nodding flowers 6–25 mm long on stems 10–30 cm tall. The flowers are magenta to deep lavender to white, with the stamens thrust out and the sepals bent back. It is highly variable and hybridizes with &quot;Primula clevelandii&quot;, from which it can be distinguished by its reddish or purplish stem.

==Distribution and habitat==
In California, it occurs in the northwest (except the north coast), the Cascade Range, the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Central Valley, the San Francisco Bay Area, the north Inner South Coast Ranges, and the San Bernardino Mountains. It is generally found in open woodlands, from sea level in British Columbia, up to altitude in California.

==Cultivation==
It needs good drainage, and needs a dry summer period. Plants germinated from seed may take 3–5 years to produce flowers. For some plants, with frequent light fertilization and moisture, dormancy may be delayed, and flowering time may be decreased to 1–2 years. Another technique to speed flowering is to place them in a cooler after dormancy, then bring them to a shadehouse in midsummer. It can be propagated by division in winter. It prefers shade when inland.

==Uses==
The leaves and roots can be eaten when roasted or boiled, but are reported to be poisonous when eaten raw.

<text>Gas Huffer was an American garage rock band from Washington. They were known for their informal and comical lyrics and their antic-laden stage presence.

== History ==
Gas Huffer classified themselves loosely in the garage punk genre. The band created comic books with each album (drawn by all four members of the band, including Joe Newton, now deputy art director for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine), that contain the lyrics to the songs. This was done for every album up to (and including) &quot;Just Beautiful Music&quot;.

Gas Huffer played its final show – dubbed &quot;The Last Huffer&quot; – at Seattle&#x27;s Crocodile Cafe on January 14, 2006. Opening the show were Girl Trouble from Tacoma, Washington, and Canned Hamm from Vancouver, British Columbia. At the conclusion of Girl Trouble&#x27;s set, K.P. Kendall called Gas Huffer&#x27;s Tom Price (who has been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease) to the stage and presented to him a &quot;Certificate of Achievement&quot;.

Prior to Gas Huffer, Tom Price played with The U-Men.

Tom Price and Don Blackstone currently play in the Tom Price Desert Classic. Matt Wright was also briefly a member in the band, having appeared in its debut 7&quot;. The Tom Price Desert Classic LP &quot;HELL&quot; was released in September 2014.

The term &quot;huffer&quot; often refers to a form of substance abuse known as huffing.

<text>Joseph Thomas Keable, VC, MM (5 May 1892 – 9 June 1918) was a Canadian soldier during the First World War. Keable was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first French Canadian soldier to be decorated with the VC and Military Medal.

Mostly wrongly spelled Kaeble in English, his actual name at baptism was Keable. His name is also oddly spelled Kable in a page of the 1911 Census of Canada.

==Biography==
He was born on 5 May 1892 in Saint-Moïse, Quebec.
He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in March 1916. Kaeble was a corporal in the 22e Battalion (Canadien Francais), CEF. On 8 June 1918 at Neuville-Vitasse, France, Kaeble performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He died whilst doing so.

==Burial and legacy==
He was buried in the local cemetery in Wanquetin, some seven miles west of Arras (Wanquetin Communal Cemetery: Plot II. Row A. Grave 8. Headstone).

At CFB Valcartier, honours to Keable include Mount Keable, just east of Camp Vimy; a street on the base; and the Keable Club, the privates&#x27; and corporals&#x27; mess. On 10 February 2011, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans announced that the nine new vessels in a new class of midshore patrol vessels would be named the Hero-class patrol vessels.
The second of the new vessels was named CCGS &quot;Caporal Keable V.C.&quot;, and was presented to the Coast Guard on 13 November 2012.
