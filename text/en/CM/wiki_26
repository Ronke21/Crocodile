<text>Sir Robert Stawell Ball (1 July 1840 – 25 November 1913) was an Irish astronomer who founded the screw theory. He was Royal Astronomer of Ireland at Dunsink Observatory.

==Life==
He was the son of naturalist Robert Ball and Amelia Gresley Hellicar. He was born in Dublin. and was educated at Trinity College Dublin where he won a scholarship in 1859 and was a senior moderator in both &quot;mathematics&quot; and &quot;experimental and natural science&quot; in 1861.

Ball worked for Lord Rosse from 1865 to 1867. In 1867, he became Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Royal College of Science in Dublin. There he lectured on mechanics and published an elementary account of the science.

In 1873, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1874, he was appointed Royal Astronomer of Ireland and Andrews Professor of Astronomy in Trinity College Dublin at Dunsink Observatory.

Ball contributed to the science of kinematics by delineating the screw displacement:
:When Ball and the screw theorists speak of screws they no longer mean actual cylindrical objects with helical threads cut into them but the possible motion of any body whatsoever, including that of the screw independently of the nut.
Ball&#x27;s treatise &quot;The Theory of Screws&quot; (1876) is now in the public domain.

His work on screw dynamics earned him in 1879 the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy.

In 1882, &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; carried his article &quot;A Glimpse through the Corridors of Time&quot;. The following year it carried his two-part article on &quot;The Boundaries of Astronomy&quot;. He was knighted in 1886.

Ball expounded the tides in &quot;Time and Tide: a Romance of the Moon&quot; (1889). He published in 1891 &quot;The Cause of an Ice Age&quot; and in 1892 &quot;An Atlas of Astronomy&quot;.

In 1892, he was appointed Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge University at the same time becoming director of the Cambridge Observatory. In 1897, he was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society. He was a fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

In 1900, Cambridge University Press published &quot;A Treatise on the Theory of Screws&quot;. It followed works meant for a more general audience, such as &quot;The Story of the Heavens&quot;, first published in 1886. Much in the limelight, he stood as President of the Quaternion Society. He was also President of the Mathematical Association in 1900.

In 1908, he published &quot;A Treatise on Spherical Astronomy&quot;, which is a textbook on astronomy starting from spherical trigonometry and the celestial sphere, considering atmospheric refraction and aberration of light, and introducing basic use of a generalised instrument.

His work, &quot;The Story of the Heavens&quot;, is mentioned in the &quot;Ithaca&quot; chapter of Ulysses.

His lectures, articles and books (e.g. &quot;Starland&quot; and &quot;The Story of the Heavens&quot;) were mostly popular and simple in style.

==Death==
He died in Cambridge and was buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife, Lady Francis Elizabeth Ball.

Their children were: Frances Amelia, Robert Steele, William Valentine (later Sir), Mary Agnetta, Charles Rowan Hamilton, and Randall Gresley (later Colonel). &quot;Reminiscences and Letters of Sir Robert Ball&quot; by his son W.V. Ball was published in 1915 by Cassell &amp; Company.

Minor planet 4809 Robertball is named in his honor.

He was the 38th President of the Birmingham and Midland Institute, which holds The Sir Robert Ball Library, the library of The Society for the History of Astronomy.

==Lectures==
Ball became celebrated for his popular lectures on science. He gave an estimated 2500 lectures between 1875 and 1910 in towns and cities across Britain and Ireland.

In 1881, 1887, 1892, 1898 and 1900 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture, &quot;Astronomy&quot;; &quot;Astronomy&quot; and &quot;Great Chapters from the Book of Nature&quot;. During the Lent term of 1900, he gave a lecture entitled &quot;The Eternal Stars&quot; to the Junior School section of Monkton Combe School in Combe Down, which was reported in the school magazine, The Magpie, 2 March 1900.

<text>USS &quot;Sea Cat&quot; (SS/AGSS-399), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for a shortened form of sea catfish, a marine fish of little food value found off the southeastern coast of the United States commissioned on 16 May 1944, with Commander Rob Roy McGregor in command. During World War II &quot;Sea Cat&quot; operated within the Pacific theatre, conducting four war patrols in wolf packs accounting for up to 17400 tons in the form of three cargo ships and an enemy vessel (17000 tons unconfirmed by wartime Japanese records). &quot;Sea Cat&quot; earned three battle stars for her World War II service.

After two and one-half years of exercises out of Balboa, her home port was changed to Key West in June 1949. In the autumn, it was decided to have a number of experimental changes made to the ship during her forthcoming overhaul, and she was redesignated AGSS-399 on 30 September. On 7 November, she arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where the work was done. The modifications and repairs were completed on 11 March 1950, and the submarine returned, via New London, to Key West. She operated from that base until she got under way on 9 January 1952 for Philadelphia and another overhaul. After her arrival on 15 January, she was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine and redesignated SS-399. She operated in Floridas waters and the Caribbean until she was decommissioned on 2 December 1968 and struck from the Navy list on the same day. She was sold for scrapping, 18 May 1973.

==World War II service==

&quot;Sea Cat&quot; was laid down on 30 October 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 21 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. E. L. Cochrane; and commissioned on 16 May 1944, Commander Rob Roy McGregor in command.

After shakedown and trials off the New England coast, the new submarine departed New London, Conn., on 28 August and proceeded via the Panama Canal to Hawaii. Following training in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Sea Cat&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 28 October and headed, via Midway and Saipan, for the South China Sea where she operated in a wolf pack which also included , , and .

During the war patrol, &quot;Sea Cat&quot; fired torpedoes at two Japanese merchantmen which, together, displaced about 15,000 tons. Her commanding officer thought that they had both been sunk, but a postwar study of Japanese records did not confirm either sinking. After 61 days at sea, including 37 days in her patrol area, &quot;Sea Cat&quot; arrived at Guam for refit.

The submarine got underway again on 1 February 1945 for her second war patrol which she conducted in the East China Sea in a wolf pack which included and . During operations off the coast of Kyūshū, she damaged a 300-ton cargo ship by gunfire and attacked a 2,000-ton ship with torpedoes. Although she reported sinking the latter, Japanese records do not seem to support the claim. &quot;Sea Cat&quot; completed the patrol upon arriving at Midway on 24 March.

On 27 April, the submarine sailed for the Yellow Sea where she and six other submarines preyed upon Japanese shipping. &quot;Sea Cat&quot; accounted for 400 tons of enemy vessels by gunfire, and she picked up two survivors of the sunken enemy ships for questioning before returning to Pearl Harbor on 25 June.

She headed toward the Kuril Islands on 6 August for her fourth war patrol; but, upon arrival in her patrol area, learned that hostilities had ceased. She was ordered to proceed to the Japanese home islands and was in Tokyo Bay during the formal surrender ceremony on 2 September. &quot;Sea Cat&quot; earned three battle stars for her World War II service.

She then sailed for the Marianas and reached Guam on 7 September. Following a brief stay at Apra Harbor, the submarine headed home. Following operations in the San Diego area into the spring of 1946, the ship proceeded to San Francisco Bay and arrived at Mare Island on 15 April 1946 for overhaul.

==Post War duties in Atlantic==

Yard work completed on 26 July, &quot;Sea Cat&quot; sailed back to San Diego, whence she departed on 12 August for her first simulated war patrol. On this cruise she visited Hawaii; Canton Island; Swains, Samoa, and Atafu Island; Tsingtao, and Shanghai.

Then, transferred to the Atlantic Fleet, the submarine arrived at Balboa, Canal Zone, on 12 January 1947. After two and one-half years of exercises out of Balboa, her home port was changed to Key West in June 1949. In the autumn, it was decided to have a number of experimental changes made to the ship during her forthcoming overhaul, and she was redesignated AGSS-399 on 30 September. On 7 November, she arrived at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where the work was done. The modifications and repairs were completed on 11 March 1950, and the submarine returned, via New London, to Key West. She operated from that base until she got under way on 9 January 1952 for Philadelphia and another overhaul. After her arrival on 15 January, she was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine and redesignated SS-399.

Overhaul and conversion completed. &quot;Sea Cat&quot; departed Philadelphia on 26 June 1952 and returned to Key West. She operated from that base for the remainder of her career, spending most of her time in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and in waters off the southern coast of the United States. In July 1966, she interrupted her customary routine by crossing the Atlantic for a four-month deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean.

Upon returning to Key West on 30 October, the submarine resumed her former routine and operated in Florida waters and the Caribbean until she was decommissioned on 2 December 1968 and struck from the Navy list on the same day. She was sold for scrapping, 18 May 1973.

<text>James Ballantyne (15 January 1772 – 26 January 1833) was a Scottish solicitor, editor and publisher who worked for his friend Sir Walter Scott. His brother John Ballantyne (1774–1821) was also with the publishing firm, which is noted for the publication of the &quot;Novelist&#x27;s Library&quot; (1820), and many works edited or written by Scott.

James was born in Kelso, Scottish Borders in 1772, the oldest son in a family of successful merchants. He attended Kelso Grammar School where he met Sir Walter Scott for the first time in 1783. Scott lived with his aunt briefly in Kelso when they met. They shared a love of literature. James went on to attend Edinburgh University to study law. He returned to Kelso in 1795 to become a solicitor.

==Publishing==
Although James was not raised in a printing family, he opened a printing office in 1796. On 13 April 1797, the first edition of the pro-Tory newspaper, &quot;The Kelso Mail&quot;, was published in which James was also the editor. Due to the newspaper being only weekly, he desired to work with those in the literary field who could use his services on the days he wasn&#x27;t printing the &quot;Mail&quot;. In 1799, he begged Scott to write a few paragraphs for the newspaper on legal questions of the day. Scott then persuaded James to publish books as well as newspapers. That same year, James secretly printed &quot;An Apology for Tales of Terror&quot; and &quot;The Eve of St John&quot;, which gave a start to Scott&#x27;s writing career. This was the beginning of a partnership that would continue until Scott&#x27;s death in 1832. Impressed with the typographical excellence of the first two published pamphlets, Scott offered James the rights to publish a collection of Border ballads that he had begun collecting. This collection was printed in 1802 as &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;, which garnered great acclaim across England. It brought amazement that such quality printing was being done in such a small town. After this success, Scott urged James to relocate to Edinburgh. After training his younger brother, Alexander, to run the &quot;Kelso Mail&quot;, James moved to Edinburgh in 1803 where he and Scott set up a publishing office that would publish Scott&#x27;s works. Alexander would eventually purchase all the rights to the Kelso Mail in 1806. Scott loaned him £500 to help him get started and set up, which he did with two presses. These soon proved to be insufficient and the space too small with the amount of work coming in. He eventually settled his shop in Holyrood in 1805. Due to financial constraints despite the publisher&#x27;s success, he joined into an ownership agreement with Scott who provided further capital. They had much success with the publishing of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;, &quot;Marmion&quot; and a number of other best sellers. Ballantyne also printed several of James Hogg&#x27;s books, beginning with &quot;The Mountain Bard&quot; (1807).

In 1815, James married Christina Hogarth, with the condition from her father that he was debt free. Scott relieved James from his debts in return for complete ownership of James Ballantyne and Co. and James would work as a salaried manager. He became theatre critic of the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Courant&quot;.

In 1817, James, along with his brother-in-law George Hogarth, purchased the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly Journal&quot; where he acted as editor. His brother, John, was the musical and drama critic while George managed the finances.

In 1820 he was living at 10 St John Street off the Canongate in Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town.

Following the death of John Ballantyne in 1821, Scott promoted James from manager to personal agent and partner. This led to Alexander Ballantyne taking over the &quot;Weekly Journal&quot; as editor. While the company flourished, with business from both Scotland and England, and obtained a corner on printing legal stationery and official documents, debts continued to mount. Scott had been borrowing money to build Abbotsford House, his personal residence, instead of putting the money towards their debt. After this change in circumstance James moved to a new house at 3 Heriot Row: a ground floor and basement house within the end pavilion.

A collapse of the financial and publishing industries in 1825–26, led to the bankruptcy of Archibald Constable&#x27;s publishing company, which published Scott&#x27;s works, and also led to the failure of Ballantyne Press. This left James with responsibility for half of the company&#x27;s debt, forcing him to sell his family valuables and new home. Scott publicly acknowledged his role in the business and used proceeds from his books to pay for the debts incurred. The debt was around £120,000.

Christina died in 1829 leaving James devastated. Scott died on 21 September 1832, followed shortly after by James on 26 January 1833. James&#x27;s home address at the end of his life was 1 Hill Street in the centre of the city. Ballantyne Press was taken over by James&#x27;s son, John Alexander Ballantyne, along with John Hughes. In December 1870, the press moved to Newington due to the growth of Waverley Edinburgh Station. The company&#x27;s printing works ceased operations in 1916.

==Relationship with Sir Walter Scott==
James and Scott worked together for over 30 years and had a close, yet complex relationship. James played a very big part in the success of Scott as a novelist. Not only did he print all of his works, he would also act as an editor. James would proofread, point out inconsistencies in the text details, fix grammatical and punctuation errors, give the whole work a scrubbing and offer advice on language and style. James was a personal agent and partner. Scott trusted James to make edits and amendments even throughout the production process.

Scott nicknamed both brothers, James and John, after characters in Henry Carey&#x27;s burlesque 
&quot;Chrononhotonthologos&quot;. James was called &quot;Aldiborontiphoscophornio&quot;.

==Family==
James is the brother of John Ballantyne, who was his business partner at times. His wife&#x27;s brother, George Hogarth, was a well-known music critic and writer. He was the uncle, through his younger brother Alexander, of R. M. Ballantyne, Scottish author and artist. His niece, Catherine Hogarth, was the wife of Charles Dickens.

==In Fiction==
The character Colbert (or &#x27;Sleek Cobby&#x27;) in &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, James Hogg&#x27;s allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene first published in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; in 1825, is based on James Ballantyne.

<text>In human genetics the midparent value of a trait is defined as the average of the trait value of the father and a scaled version of that of the mother. This value can be used in a study to analyze the data set without heeding sex effects. Studying quantitative traits in heritability studies may be complicated by sex differences observed for the trait. 

Well-known examples include studies of humans&#x27; height, whose midparent value &quot;h&quot;&quot;mp&quot; is given by:

:formula_1

where &quot;h&quot;&quot;f&quot; is the father&#x27;s height, and &quot;h&quot;&quot;m&quot; the mother&#x27;s.

The coefficient 1.08 serves as a scaling factor. After the 1.08 scaling, the mean of the mother&#x27;s height is the same as that of the father&#x27;s, and the variance is closer to the father&#x27;s; in this way, sex difference can be ignored.

<text>Ladislav Fialka (22 August 1931 in Prague – 22 February 1991 in Prague) was a mime from what is now the Czech Republic.

In 1956 he founded a theater. Helena Philipová, Ivan Vyskočil, Jiří Suchý and Vladimír Vodička also contributed to the theater organization. By 1958, Divadlo Na zábradlí (Theatre at the Railing) was born from this, the only independent pantomime theater in Eastern Europe, and then &quot;Divadlo Na zábradlí&quot; became one of the outstanding workshops of modern Czech theater. In 1968, he was also able to present the works of Václav Havel (Garden Festival, Leirat). Legendary performances were the adaptation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s The Trial of King Ubu and Miloš Macourek&#x27;s play Zsuzsanna. From 1962, the previously banned Jan Grosmann became the director of the theater. Fialka became a significant, world-famous figure in pantomime art with his unique style and acting skills. His famous plays are Etudes, The Nose (Gogol), Dreams. He traveled the whole world with his company. He also performed with his theater in Budapest in 1981.

<text>Among science fiction and fantasy, comic book, and media fans, a Big Name Fan (BNF) is a member of a fandom who is particularly well-known and celebrated for their writings in fanzines, semi-professional magazines and (more recently) blogs; or for other contributions such as art and (in some communities) fanfiction. Some BNFs have also contributed to the franchise itself (&quot;Doctor Who&quot; is noted for being primarily written and produced by people who were BNFs of the series before it was brought back in 2005). They may have fans of their own, who praise them and seek out their work.

BNFs may have their autographs requested at conventions; they are often invited as Guests of Honor at conventions, and in some fandoms may be paid to speak as guests at commercial shows which pay for appearances. The term originated in science fiction fandom, and dates to 1955 or earlier. It was recorded in 1955, in Bob Tucker&#x27;s &quot;The Neo-Fan Guide&quot;; other early references include 1959&#x27;s &quot;Fancyclopedia II&quot; and Donald Franson&#x27;s 1962 work &quot;A Key to the Terminology of Science-Fiction Fandom&quot;. In its original sense, &#x27;BNF&#x27; referred to &quot;one well known within the world of science-fiction fandom&quot;.

== Discontinued Hugo Award ==
When the Hugo Awards were instituted in 1953, one of the categories was &quot;#1 Fan Personality&quot;, which has also been referred to as the &quot;BNF Award.&quot; This award, which was not revived when the Hugos became institutionalized in 1955, was given to Forrest J Ackerman. (According to an interim report issued by the Philcon II convention committee while voting was still going on, the next most popular candidate at the time was Harlan Ellison; but at the time Ackerman was given the award, he actually physically declined it in favor of Ken Slater, to whom the trophy was later forwarded.)

== Connotations and usage ==
Fans report ambivalent feelings towards BNFs. The title BNF also carries a negative connotation of being arrogant and self-important. Accordingly, many people who are deemed BNFs resist being tagged with that designation.

<text>Joseph-Nicolas Delisle (; 4 April 1688 – 11 September 1768) was a French astronomer and cartographer. Delisle is mostly known for the Delisle scale, a temperature scale he invented in 1732.

==Life==
Joseph was born in Paris, one of the 11 sons of Claude Delisle (1644–1720). Like many of his brothers, among them Guillaume Delisle, he initially followed classical studies. Soon however, he moved to astronomy under the supervision of Joseph Lieutaud and Jacques Cassini. In 1714 he entered the French Academy of Sciences as pupil of Giacomo Filippo Maraldi. In the next year he discovered the Arago spot a century before Arago. Though he was a good scientist and member of a wealthy family he did not have much money.

In 1712, he set up an observatory at the Luxembourg Palace and after three years moved to the Hotel de Taranne. From 1719 to 1722 he was employed at the Royal observatory, before returning to his observatory at the Luxembourg Palace. In 1724 he met Edmond Halley in London and, among other things, discussed the transits of Venus.

His life changed radically in 1725 when he was called by the Russian czar Peter the Great to Saint Petersburg to create and run the school of astronomy. He arrived there only in 1726, after the death of the czar. He became quite rich and famous, to such an extent that when he returned to Paris in 1747, he built a new observatory in the palace of Cluny, later made famous by Charles Messier. Also he received the title of Astronomer from the Academy. In Russia he prepared the map of the known North Pacific that was used by Vitus Bering.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1725 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1749. In 1760 he proposed that the international scientific community co-ordinate observations of the 1761 Transit of Venus to determine the absolute distance of the Earth from the Sun. He developed a map showing where on Earth this transit would be visible and thus where various observing stations should be located. Actual implementation of these observational efforts were hindered by the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1763 he retired to the Abbey of St Genevieve, dying in Paris sometime in 1768.

==Expedition to Siberia==
In 1740, Delisle undertook an expedition to Siberia with the object of observing from Beryozovo the transit of Mercury across the sun. An account of the expedition is given in Volume 72 of the &quot;L&#x27;Histoire générale des voyages&quot; (1768). Delisle and his party set out from St. Petersburg on 28 February 1740, arriving in Beryozovo, on the bank of the River Ob, on 9 April, having travelled via Moscow, the Volga, and Tyumen. On 22 April, the date of the transit of Mercury, the sun was obscured by clouds, however, and so Delisle was unable to make any astronomical observations. Delisle arrived back in St. Petersburg on 29 December 1740, having sojourned in Tobolsk and Moscow en route.

===Non-astronomical scientific observations===
Throughout the expedition, Delisle recorded numerous ornithological, botanical, zoological (e.g. the Siberian beaver), geographical, and other scientific observations. In the &quot;Extrait d&#x27;un voyage fait en 1740 à Beresow en Sibérie&quot; published in the &quot;Histoire Générale des Voyages&quot;, Delisle&#x27;s ethnographic observations on the native peoples he encountered (the Votyaks, Ostyaks, Tartars, Voguls, and Chuvash) include details of their religious beliefs, marital customs, means of subsistence, diet, and costume. It seems that Delisle even planned to write a general study of the peoples of Siberia. In Delisle&#x27;s unpublished papers there is a document entitled &quot;Ordre des informations à faire sur chaque différente nation&quot;, which gives a structured outline of the ethnographic data to be collected for each particular Siberian nation: its history, geographical area, relations with other ruling powers, system of government, religion (e.g. belief in God, the Devil, life after death), knowledge in the arts and sciences, physical characteristics, costume, occupations, tools, mores, dwellings, and language.

===Delisle&#x27;s &quot;cabinet de curiosité&quot;===
On 30 June 1740, Delisle visited a monastery in Tobolsk, where in addition to Russian and Old Church Slavonic manuscripts he was shown a mammoth tusk and other bones &quot;d&#x27;une grandeur extraordinaire&quot;. The abbot recounted to Delisle that the previous year (1739) a Siberian merchant by the name of Fugla, already famous for his prodigious strength (he had fought and killed a bear with his bare hands), further added to his fame when he found near Yeniseisk an intact mammoth head &quot;d&#x27;une grosseur étonnante.&quot; Delisle himself was an indefatigable collector and during his Siberian expedition he took every opportunity to add to his &quot;cabinet de curiosité&quot;, bringing back with him not only copies of manuscripts and mammoth bones like those he had seen in Tobolsk, but also &quot;objets hétéroclites,&quot; which included items of Ostyak costume, a Samoyed quiver, a bark bucket, rare stones, and Tobolsk porcelain ware.

==The &quot;Atlas Rossicus&quot;==
The plan for a map of the Russian Empire was launched by Peter the Great, but did not come to fruition until two decades later, in the reign of Empress Anna. Ivan Kirilov (1689–1737), the first director of the imperial Cartographic Office, had Delisle officially invited to Russia with a view to his collaborating on the proposed map of the empire. However, Delisle and Kirilov clashed on how best to draw up the maps, with the former favouring the establishment of a network of astronomically determined points, a very time-consuming process, and the latter arguing for surveying based on geographical features as reference points, subsequently to be adjusted to the astronomically determined points. Using his own methods, but consulting Delisle for expert advice, Kirilov published in 1734 a general map and the first fourteen regional maps of an intended series of 120. The edition was abandoned after Kirilov&#x27;s death in 1737. It was not until 1745 that the Academy in Saint Petersburg finally published a complete &quot;Atlas Rossicus&quot;, in Latin and Cyrillic script, consisting of a general map and 29 regional maps (&quot;Атлас Российской/Atlas Rossicus&quot;, Petropoli, 1745–1746). Delisle worked on the atlas in the 1730s, but his extreme scientific rigour considerably slowed its progress. For this reason, in 1740, while he was absent from the capital, undertaking his expedition to Siberia, Delisle was officially dismissed from the supervisory board in charge of the atlas. Schumacher, the secretary of the Academy, even went so far as to accuse him of sending secret documents to France. Increasingly isolated at court, Delisle requested permission to leave Russia in 1743, which was granted four years later. In the meantime, the &quot;Atlas Rossicus&quot; was submitted for publication in Delisle&#x27;s name. In &quot;History of Cartography&quot;, Leo Bagrow argues that &quot;by rights [the atlas] should not bear his name,&quot; but Marie-Anne Chabin, an expert on Delisle&#x27;s life and unpublished manuscripts, concludes: &quot;Despite all, Joseph-Nicolas Delisle should be regarded as its main architect.&quot;

<text>Hertta Elina Kuusinen (14 February 1904 – 18 March 1974) was a Finnish Communist politician. She was a member of the central committee (1944–1971) and the political bureau of the Communist Party of Finland; member of Finland&#x27;s parliament, the Eduskunta (1945–1972); general secretary (1952–1958); and leader of the parliamentary group of the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League.

==Early life==
Born in Luhanka on 14 February 1904, she was the daughter of Soviet politician and one-time Finnish communist leader Otto Ville Kuusinen. Hertta Kuusinen moved to the Soviet Union after her father in the 1920s. She worked for the Comintern beginning in 1922, witnessed Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in Germany during 1932–1933, and taught in the International Lenin School from 1933 to 1934. Kuusinen returned to Finland in 1934 to work underground for the illegal communist party. Instead she ended up in prison for over ten years.

==Career==
Kuusinen became known for being the leading female communist in post-war Finland. In 1948, she became only the second woman to serve as a Finnish cabinet minister.
The political climate in Finland changed after World War II. Kuusinen was released; and in the first post-war elections held in 1945, she was elected to the Eduskunta from the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League (SKDL) list. She was General Secretary of the SKDL from 1952 to 1958, when the SKDL became the largest party in the Eduskunta with 50 of 200 seats. She was a member of Parliament until 1972, and also held the record in personal votes (58 770 / 1948) received in parliamentary elections that stood until the 2007 election. Between 1969 and 1974, Kuusinen served as the chairperson of the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation.

==Personal life==
Kuusinen was married to communist politicians Tuure Lehén (1923–1933) and Yrjö Leino (1945–1950).

==Death==
She died in Moscow on 18 March 1974, aged 70.

<doc id="1200806" wikidata="Q2608562" url="?curid=1200806" title="Thames A.F.C.">
<text>Thames A.F.C. were an English football club from Custom House, east London, which played in the Football League between 1930 and 1932.

==Name==
Unlike other AFCs such as Sunderland A.F.C., the word Association was initially presented as part of the club name – i.e. Thames Association or Thames Association FC. The &quot;Association&quot; was abbreviated upon joining the Football League, giving the team the more regular name of Thames AFC.

==History==
They were founded in 1928, in a similar manner to Sheffield United, Liverpool, New Brighton Tower and nearby Chelsea: to play on a ground which had no football club in residence. In Thames&#x27; case, they were formed by a group of businessmen who had built the West Ham Stadium, with a capacity of 120,000, in the Custom House area of Essex (now part of the London Borough of Newham in Greater London); the stadium was primarily used for greyhound and speedway racing which took place during the week, leaving Saturdays free. The directors of the stadium decided to form a professional football club to play on Saturdays, to bring in additional revenue to the stadium.

The club began playing in the Southern League Eastern Division, and finished 14th in their first season and third in the season after that (1929–30). This was enough for them to gain election to the Football League Third Division South in the middle of 1930, in place of Merthyr Town. Their request to join the league was considered alongside applications from Aldershot, Llanelli and Argonauts. The success of their application required them to suddenly upgrade the quality of the team. To achieve this objective, the newly promoted club placed an advert for &quot;First Class Players Wanted. All Positions&quot; in the June edition of the Athletic News. Thames continued to field a reserve side in the Southern League for a single further season, before withdrawing entirely in 1931.

Thames&#x27; spell in the Football League was a short and unhappy one. The club struggled to attract spectators. It established a supporters&#x27; group, which at one point had over 1,000 members. However, this effort did not translate into a reliable supporter base that would regularly attend matches. Despite the stadium&#x27;s capacity of 120,000 (making it the largest ground in England to regularly host League football), the club holds the record for the lowest known attendance for a Saturday Football League match; just 469 fans paid to watch Thames play Luton Town on 6 December 1930.

Unable to compete with established teams nearby that included: Charlton Athletic, Clapton Orient, Millwall and West Ham United, Thames struggled. By December 1931, the club was under severe financial pressure. To keep the club afloat, the players agreed to take a pay cut. They finished 20th out of 22 clubs in 1930–31, and 22nd (i.e., bottom) the following season (1931–32). This prompted the club directors&#x27; decision not to seek re-election to the League for the following season and wind up the club, despite an approach from Clapton Orient to merge the two clubs. Their league place was taken by Aldershot.

Thames AFC are not the same club as Thames Ironworks FC, a club that predated them by over 30 years, and would go on to be renamed West Ham United.

===Seasons===
==Players==
Notable players for Thames included former England international Jimmy Dimmock, former Welsh internationals Len Davies and Moses Russell and ex-Arsenal striker Henry White. Eddie Perry went on to be a Welsh international.

==Colours==
Thames&#x27; home colours were red and blue quartered shirts with white shorts and black socks with red and blue trim.

==Records and statistics==
Thames&#x27; record for their two seasons in the Football League was played 84, won 20, drew 17, lost 47, scored 107 and conceded 202. The club&#x27;s record league win was 6–3, against Mansfield Town on 2 April 1932, while their record league loss was 8–0, against Luton Town on 11 April 1931 and Fulham on 28 March 1932. The furthest they ever reached in the FA Cup was the First Round proper, in 1929–30, 1930–31 and 1931–32.

In total, 103,698 fans watched all of Thames&#x27; games, at an average of 2,469 per game, which ranks them as 122 out of all the 130 Football League teams in terms of attendance. The club&#x27;s record highest attendance was approximately 8,000, against Exeter City in August 1931.

<doc id="1200808" wikidata="Q1194195" url="?curid=1200808" title="A Marriage Proposal">
<text>A Marriage Proposal (sometimes translated as simply &quot;The Proposal&quot;, ) is a one-act farce by Anton Chekhov, written in 1888–1889 and first performed in 1890. It is a fast-paced play of dialogue-based action and situational humour. A young man Lomov comes to propose to his neighbour Natalya but they keep on fighting over various topics.

==Plot synopsis==
&quot;Ivan Vassilevitch Lomov&quot;, a long-time neighbour of &quot;Stepan Stepanovitch Chubukov&quot;, has come to propose marriage to Chubukov&#x27;s 25-year-old daughter, &quot;Natalya Stepanovna&quot;. After he has asked and received joyful permission to marry Natalya, she is invited into the room, and he tries to convey to her the proposal. Lomov is a hypochondriac (worry about illness, palpitations in this case), and, while trying to make clear his reasons for being there, he gets into an argument with Natalia about The Oxen Meadows, a disputed piece of land between their respective properties, which results in him having &quot;palpitations&quot; and numbness in his leg. After her father noticed they are arguing, he joins in, and then sends Ivan out of the house. While Stepan rants about Lomov, he expresses his shock that &quot;this fool dares to make you (Natalya) a proposal of marriage!&quot; Natalya then realizes that Lomov wanted to marry her and immediately starts into hysterics (ungovernable emotional excess), begging for her father to bring him back. He does, and Natalia and Ivan get into a second big argument, this time about the superiority of their respective hunting dogs, Guess and Squeezer. Ivan collapses from his exhaustion over arguing, and father and daughter fear he&#x27;s dead, sending them into another round of hysterics. However, after a few minutes he regains consciousness, and Chubukov all but forces him and his daughter to accept the proposal with a kiss. Immediately following the kiss, the couple gets into another argument over their dogs while Chubukov tries to calm them and offers champagne.

==Performance history==
&quot;The Proposal&quot; was successful in its first runs in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and quickly became popular in small towns across Russia. Tsar Alexander III liked the play when he had it performed for him. Chekhov himself thought farces were not really worth much as literature; before its success, he called &quot;The Proposal&quot; a &quot;wretched, boring, vulgar little skit&quot;. He advised its director, Leontiev, to &quot;roll cigarettes out of it for all I care&quot;.

When Vassar College staged &quot;The Proposal&quot; in the 1920s, they performed it three times in one evening, each with a very different staging: &quot;as realism, expressionism, and constructivism&quot;. In the second version, played closer to tragedy, the actors were masked, and in the third the actors were all dressed in work suits in a playground, tossing a ball between them.

In 1935 in the Soviet Union, the seminal Russian theatre practitioner Vsevolod Meyerhold combined &quot;The Proposal&quot; with Chekhov&#x27;s other short plays &quot;The Bear&quot; and &quot;The Anniversary&quot; to form a three-act play called &quot;33 Swoons&quot; that demonstrated the weakness of the pre-revolutionary intelligentsia.
In late June and early July, 2016, three performances of the play were performed at St. Werburgh&#x27;s Church Parish Hall, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, England.

It was adapted for Australian TV in 1957.

The 1972 Soviet slapstick film &quot;My God, Ilya!&quot; parodies the short play during is climax.

In 1976, an Indonesian movie director/ writer made an adaptation titled &quot;Pinangan&quot;, which was cast by Benyamin Sueb, a comedian, and Rima Melati, a young actress.

<text>Slobomir (Cyrillic: &quot;Слобомир&quot;) is a new town project in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located on the Drina River near Bijeljina, part of the Bijeljina municipality. It was founded by Slobodan Pavlović, a Bosnian Serb businessman.

According to Pavlović, it is supposed to be one of the major cities of post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina. The city is planned be located in two countries, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia, with the majority of it in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city&#x27;s name is a combination of its founder&#x27;s name, Slobodan Pavlović, and his wife&#x27;s name, Mira. Conveniently, its name means &quot;the city of freedom and peace&quot;, from the words &quot;sloboda&quot;, meaning freedom, and &quot;mir&quot;, meaning peace.

The city is under construction on both sides of the Drina River, next to a major road from Bijeljina to Bogatić, in the vicinity of &quot;Pavlović&#x27;s bridge&quot; which connects Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.

The city&#x27;s plans include a &quot;Pavlović Tower&quot;, intended to be the biggest building on the Balkan peninsula with 37 floors. 

The largest completed buildings are Slobomir P University, the Pavlović International Bank, and the Slobomir duty-free zone.

<doc id="1200834" wikidata="Q3595831" url="?curid=1200834" title="A. K. Gopalan">
<text>Ayillyath Kuttiari Gopalan (1 October 1904 – 22 March 1977), popularly known as A. K. Gopalan or AKG, was an Indian communist politician. He was one of 16 Communist Party of India members elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1952. Later he became one of the founding members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

== Early life and education ==
Ayillyath Kuttiari Gopalan Nambiar was born on 1 October 1904 in Peralasseri, Kannur District of Northern Kerala and educated in Tellichery. He was educated at Basel Evangelical Mission Parsi High School, Thalassery and at Government Brennen College, Thalassery. By the time he became a teacher, India&#x27;s independence movement was becoming energised by Mahatma Gandhi. Gopalan took part in the Khilafat Movement which prompted a marked change in his outlook, transforming him into a dedicated full-time social and political worker. He was also involved in Malabar revolution. During this time, he removed the suffix to his name (Nambiar) that suggested caste status.

== Indian National Congress ==
In 1927 he joined the Indian National Congress and began playing an active role in the Khadi Movement and the upliftment of Harijans. He was arrested for participating in the salt satyagraha in 1930.

=== Kandoth assault ===

While in prison he got acquainted with communism and became a member of the Congress Socialist Party and later the Communist Party of India when it finally took shape in Kerala in 1939. He led the hunger march from Malabar region to Madras in 1936 and the Malabar Jatha in support of the movement for responsible government in Travancore. The strongest caste system was in the North Kerala. The lower caste people were not allowed to walk on a public road in Payyannur. At this time A.K. Gopalan and the Keralites led the procession through the public road in front of the Kandoth Thiyya caste Temple (Palliyara) near Payyanur, Kannur. The lower castes were not allowed by the then Thiyyar chiefs to walk on a public road in Kandoth temple. &quot;This is a time when Harijans are being denied the freedom to travel on public roads.&quot; The reason was that the nearby temple would be defiled. To promote the Guruvayoor Satyagraha. The group consisting of Kelappan and Gopalan marched along this route with the Harijans. As the procession approached the road, a crowd of about 200 people, including young men and women, A.K. Gopalan, Keraliyan and the Harijans were very badly beaten up by the Thiyya leaders. Gopal and others were later admitted to the hospital. The attack lasted for half an hour. This was the first crackdown on Gopalan&#x27;s political career. Women came carrying heavy wooden sticks and beat them. All the people present in Ghosha were beaten by these chiefs. But A.K.G Standing where Gopalan and Keralian were, he faced the barrage. Others fled. A.K.G told the accompanying women to run to safety. The attack lasted for half an hour. The &quot;Kandoth short stick&quot; was infamous in the press of the day. Many people were injured. A.K. Gopalan and Keralian fell unconscious. They were taken by car to the hospital, where they lay unconscious for several hours. Even the Keralite&#x27;s death statement was taken. Took home in the morning This attack K. This was Gopalan&#x27;s first physical attack in his political career. But the &quot;Kandoth assault&quot; was an event that found a prominent place in news coverage.

== Further arrest ==

The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 prompted an upsurge in activism against British domination, and Gopalan was again arrested. But in 1942 he escaped from prison and remained at large till the end of the war in 1945. He was arrested again shortly after the end of the war and was still behind bars when India became independent on 15 August 1947. He was released a few weeks later. Thereafter he was a member of Lok Sabha for 5 consecutive terms till his death on 22 March 1977 and became one of the leaders of opposition parties in the parliament of India.

During the Sino-Indian war in 1962, AKG along with other Indian communists like E.M.S. took an impartial view and requested both nations to discuss and settle the matter peacefully. The official leadership of the party at that time denounced this and supported the India Government. Many leaders of the left group were arrested with the support of the leadership of the party. When the party leadership blocked the publication of an article written by then General Secretary EMS condemning government for attacking the left leaders in the party using the cover of the war, he himself quit the post and supported the left group. AKG was part of the left group and faced disciplinary action by the party leadership dominated by the right. During this time a newspaper published a letter allegedly written by rightist leaders S.A Dange to the British during the freedom struggle. In this letter he promised to keep away from the freedom struggle if granted bail. This was used by the left group to beat the right. When the demand of the left to set up a party-level inquiry about the alleged letter of S.A Dange was rejected in the National Council of CPI, the left group walked away and formed a new Party.

AKG joined the new break away faction, which later came to be known as Communist Party of India (Marxist). He also wrote extensively. His autobiography &quot;Ente Jeevitha Kadha&quot; has been translated into many languages. His other works include &quot;For Land&quot;, &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Work in Parliament&quot;, and &quot;Collected Speeches&quot;, all in Malayalam.

=== A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras ===

In 1950, A. K. Gopalan was served with a detention order under &quot;Preventive Detention Act 1950.&quot; He appealed to Supreme Court under Article 32 of Indian Constitution claiming his fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression and to travel freely in India have been violated. The six-judge bench of Supreme Court with a majority of four upheld his detention. But the bench struck down Section 14 of this act, which provided that the grounds for detention should not be given to detenus.

== Political career ==
== Marriage ==
AKG was earlier married and later left his wife. Later AKG was married to Susheela Gopalan, who was a prominent Marxist and trade union activist, from the Cheerappanchira family. His daughter, Laila, is married to P. Karunakaran, a former Member of Parliament for the Kasargod constituency.

== Indian Coffee House ==

AKG played an important role in the formation of Indian Coffee House, a worker cooperative initiative by organising the thrown out employees of Coffee Houses of Coffee Board to establish ICHs in late 1950s.

<text>Louis-Alphonse-Victor, 5th duc de Broglie, called Victor de Broglie (30 October 1846 – 26 August 1906), was a French aristocrat.

==Biography==
Victor de Broglie was born in Rome, Italy where his father, monarchist politician Albert, 4th duc de Broglie, held a diplomatic post.

On 26 September 1871, he married Pauline de La Forest d&#x27;Armaillé (1851–1928) in Paris. With her, he had four children who survived to adulthood, including two sons, Maurice and Louis, both of whom were physicists, and both of whom would hold the ducal title. Louis would win the Nobel Prize for Physics and go on to win other national and international honors over his long life.

De Broglie acceded to the title of duc de Broglie on his father&#x27;s death in 1901 but died only a few years later, passing the title to his eldest son, Maurice.

Maurice died in 1960 and was succeeded by his brother Louis, who died in 1987. Maurice had no surviving children, while Louis died unmarried, and the title passed collaterally to Victor-François, a descendant of the 5th Duke&#x27;s third younger brother.

<text>Roger Kwok Wah Hui (December 29, 1953 – October 16, 2021) was a computer scientist who worked on array programming languages. He codeveloped the programming language J.

==Education and career==
Hui was born in Hong Kong in 1953. In 1966, he immigrated to Canada with his entire family.

In 1973, Hui entered the University of Alberta. In his second year he took a course on probability and statistics in which students were expected to learn the programming language APL with little or no formal instruction. He used all the time he could muster on a heavily burdened computer, and benefited from the &quot;APL\360 User&#x27;s Manual&quot; (the book &quot;APL Language&quot; was not published until March 1975). Because the manual was written by Adin Falkoff and Kenneth E. Iverson, Hui thought it reasonable to say he learned APL from Falkoff and Iverson.

As a summer student in 1975 and 1976, Hui worked at I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA) in Calgary, on workspaces for statistical and probability calculations. The major attraction of the job was the unrestricted computer time with access to APL.

After receiving a BSc degree with first class honors in computer science in 1977, Hui worked for two years as a full-time programmer and analyst in the new Edmonton office of IPSA, where his main duty was to support clients in their use of APL time-sharing. He attended the APL79 conference in Rochester, New York, where Iverson gave two papers: &quot;The Role of Operators in APL&quot; and &quot;The Derivative Operator&quot;. On the way, Hui stopped at IPSA in Toronto and obtained a copy of &quot;Operators and Functions&quot; [IBM Research Report No. 7091, 1978]. He has been studying that paper and its successors ever since.

In September 1979, Hui entered the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and received his MSc in May 1981 with a thesis on &quot;The complexity of some decompositions in matrix algebra.&quot;

After completing his master&#x27;s degree, Hui worked from 1981 to 1985 as an APL systems analyst and programmer for the Alberta Energy Company in Edmonton. In February 1982 Hui purchased &quot;A Source Book in APL&quot; (1981), in which the most memorable papers were &quot;The Design of APL&quot; (1973), &quot;The Evolution of APL&quot; (1978), and &quot;Notation as a Tool of Thought&quot; (1980).

Hui&#x27;s work was described at the APL85 conference in a paper, &quot;DESIGN: A Financial Modelling System&quot;, written jointly with his supervisor, Fred Appleyard. The basic objects in the system were in &quot;Direct Definition&quot; (Iverson, 1976, 1980), and Falkoff and Iverson&#x27;s &quot;The Design of APL&quot; was cited. Hui left Alberta Energy shortly after being promoted to a non-APL and non-programming position, and was out of work, and had no access to computers, from September 1985 to April 1986. This gave him plenty of time for intense study of Iverson&#x27;s &quot;Rationalized APL&quot; (1983) and &quot;A Dictionary of the APL Language&quot;, as it was then named.

Hui and his wife Stella had two children. He died on October 16, 2021, from cancer.

==J language==

In the early 1990s, Ken Iverson and Hui began collaborating on an advanced continuation of an APL-like language which they named J. The improvements were intended to fix some of the persistent character set issues that had plagued APL since its inception, and to add new advanced features such as support for parallel &quot;multiple instruction, multiple data&quot; (MIMD) operations. It was intended that the J language be an improvement over then extant APL. The J interpreter and language continue to evolve.

In 1996, he received the Kenneth E. Iverson Award for Outstanding Contribution to APL.

<doc id="1200869" wikidata="Q670272" url="?curid=1200869" title="Bricolage (album)">
<text>Bricolage is a 1997 album by Brazilian electronic music artist Amon Tobin. It was Tobin&#x27;s second album, the first released under his own name, and his first on the Ninja Tune label. The album was a departure from his first album, &quot;Adventures in Foam&quot; (as Cujo), incorporating a heavier blend of jazz melodies and intense jungle rhythms. The album was followed by &quot;Permutation&quot; in 1998.

The album art for &quot;Bricolage&quot; depicts part of Alexander Liberman&#x27;s &quot;Olympic Iliad&quot; sculpture, located at the base of the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington.

==Reception==

Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave &quot;Bricolage&quot; a maximum rating of 10/10, praising Amon Tobin for the way he produced an album of old jazz music with modern technology, such as samplers and electric keyboards. Sean Cooper of AllMusic stated that the album was consistently engaging and blurred the distinction between jungle and jazz. In 2015, &quot;Fact&quot; ranked the album at 23 on its list of &quot;The 50 Best Trip-Hop Albums of All Time,&quot; where they described it as a midway point between IDM and the &quot;moodier landscapes&quot; of several trip hop artists.

==Soundtrack appearances==
The track &quot;Easy Muffin&quot; was used in Toonami advertisements for Gundam SEED as well as several episodes of &quot;IGPX&quot;. It is also used in the 2002 film &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; and in many episodes of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. It is also played on the second episode of the first series of &quot;Almost Human&quot;. &quot;Easy Muffin&quot; has also been used in Lincoln Motor Company television ads starting in 2015.

<doc id="1200878" wikidata="Q2465268" url="?curid=1200878" title="Mi'kmaw hieroglyphs">
<text>Mi&#x27;kmaw hieroglyphic writing or Suckerfish script (Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;sit: ) was a writing system for the Mi&#x27;kmaw language, later superseded by various Latin scripts which are currently in use. Mi&#x27;kmaw are a Canadian First Nation whose homeland, called Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, overlaps much of the Atlantic provinces, specifically all of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and parts of New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.

These glyphs, or , were derived from a pictograph and petroglyph tradition, and are logograms, with phonetic elements used alongside, including logographic, alphabetic, and ideographic information. The take their name from the (plural: ) or sucker fish whose tracks are visibly left on the muddy river bottom. Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;sit uses several spelling systems, and the script is consequently sometimes called or .

==Classification==
Scholars have debated whether the earliest known Mi&#x27;kmaw &quot;hieroglyphs&quot;, from the 17th century, qualified fully as a writing system or served as a pictographic mnemonic device. In the 17th century, French Jesuit missionary Chrétien Le Clercq &quot;formed&quot; the Mi&#x27;kmaw characters as a logographic system for pedagogical purposes, in order to teach Catholic prayers, liturgy and doctrine to the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

In 1978, Ives Goddard and William Fitzhugh of the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution, contended that the pre-missionary system was purely mnemonic. They said that it could not have been used to write new compositions.

By contrast, in a 1995 book, David L. Schmidt and Murdena Marshall published some of the post-missionary prayers, narratives, and liturgies, as represented by hieroglyphs—pictographic symbols, which the French missionaries had used in the last quarter of the seventeenth century, to teach prayers and hymns. Schmidt and Marshall showed that these hieroglyphics served as a fully functional writing system. They said that it was the oldest writing system for a native language in North America north of Mexico.

Michelle Sylliboy indicates that &quot;(a) French missionary stole our historical narrative with outlandish claims about our written language&quot;, and cites her Mi&#x27;kmaw grandmother (Lillian B. Marshall, 1934–2018) who stated in her &quot;last conversation before she died, to make sure to tell “them” that we’ve always had our language,&quot; seemingly asserting that Le Clercq did not invent the script, and it had been in use by the people long before him. However, this seems to contradict the fact that after Le Clerq&#x27;s return to France in 1687, the script had to be taught to other groups of Mi&#x27;kmaq by other missionaries, indicating it was not a script that the indigenous peoples already knew.

==History==
Father Le Clercq, a Catholic missionary on the Gaspé Peninsula in New France from 1675, saw Mi&#x27;kmaw children writing &quot;marks&quot; on birchbark and then counting them to help in the memorization of prayers. Le Clercq then formed symbols to write prayers and liturgy. Mi&#x27;kmak also used porcupine quills pressed directly into the bark in the shape of symbols.

This adapted writing system proved popular among Mi&#x27;kmaq. They were still using it in the 19th century. Since there is no historical or archaeological evidence of these symbols from before the arrival of this missionary, it is unclear how ancient the use of the pre-missionary mnemonic glyphs was. The relationship of these symbols to Mi&#x27;kmaq petroglyphs, which predated European encounter, is unclear.

The Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site (KNPNHS), petroglyphs of &quot;life-ways of the Mi&#x27;kmaw&quot;, include written hieroglyphics, human figures, Mi&#x27;kmaq houses and lodges, decorations including crosses, sailing vessels, and animals, etched into slate rocks. These are attributed to the Mi&#x27;kmaq, who have continuously inhabited the area since prehistoric times. The petroglyphs date from the late prehistoric period through the nineteenth century. A Mi&#x27;kmaq healer, Jerry Lonecloud, transcribed some of these petroglyphs in 1912, and donated his copies to the provincial museum.

Pierre Maillard, Catholic priest, during the winter of 1737–1738 created a system of hieroglyphics to transcribe Mi&#x27;kmaq words. He used these symbols to write formulas for the principal prayers and the responses of the faithful, in the catechism, so that his followers might learn them more readily. There is no direct evidence that Maillard was aware of Le Clercq&#x27;s work in this same field. Maillard left numerous works in the language, which continued in use among the Mi&#x27;kmaq into the 20th century.

<text>As of January 2025, [[Singapore Airlines]] (and its subsidiary Scoot) flies to 120 international destinations in 46 countries from its primary hub in Singapore Changi Airport. China is connected to sixteen airports, the highest number of destinations, seven to Australia, and six destinations in the US

After the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, Singapore Airlines discontinued flying to Berlin, Darwin, Cairns, Hangzhou, Kagoshima, and Sendai. Toronto was discontinued in 1994. During the SARS outbreak in 2003/04, Singapore Airlines discontinued flying to Brussels, Las Vegas, Chicago, Hiroshima, Kaohsiung, Mauritius, Vienna, Madrid, Seattle, Shenzhen and Surabaya. In addition, Singapore Airlines discontinued flights to Vancouver and Amritsar in 2009, and São Paulo in 2016.

Singapore Airlines presently operates the longest and second longest flights in the world, non-stop to New York–JFK and Newark respectively, using the Airbus A350-900ULR. 

Singapore to Newark was the world&#x27;s longest flight from 2004-2013, and 2018-2021, when they started JFK to Singapore. 

Previously, it operated to Newark with the Airbus A340-500 aircraft until they were phased out in 2013. Non-stop service to Los Angeles, also previously operated with the A340-500, also resumed in November 2018 with the new A350-900ULR.

In October 2016, Singapore Airlines restarted its nonstop service from Singapore to the US with the launch of its new Singapore-San Francisco route. The route flies A350-900 aircraft and includes Business, Premium Economy and Economy classes.

The former Capital Express Route linking Singapore and Wellington via Canberra was replaced in May 2018 with Singapore-Sydney-Canberra-Singapore and Singapore-Melbourne-Wellington-Melbourne-Singapore routes.

In September 2020, the carrier announced that it would suspend services to Canberra, Dusseldorf, Stockholm and Wellington due to a drop in demand arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Chantelle was a popular all-female merengue musical group formed in 1988 in Puerto Rico, composed of members Olga Tañón, Sandra Torres and Daly Fontanez.

Chantelle&#x27;s biggest hit was a cover of Juan Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Queriendo y No&quot; (&quot;Wanting and Not Wanting&quot;) in 1989. The trio performed the song at the 1990 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards and won the award for &quot;Tropical New Artist of the Year&quot;. Of the three women in the group, Tañón later became the most successful after leaving Chantelle in 1992 to launch a solo career, which led to the group&#x27;s eventual disbanding.

<doc id="1200898" wikidata="Q3305056" url="?curid=1200898" title="British Rail Class D3/7">
<text>The British Railways Class D3/7 is a class of 0-6-0 diesel electric shunting locomotives built as LMS Nos. 7080–7119. The class were built from May 1939 through to July 1942 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at their Derby Works using a diesel electric transmission supplied by English Electric.

They are a modified version of the 1934-vintage Class D3/6 (LMS 7069-7079) diesel shunters based on the English Electric 6K diesel engine of , but have jackshaft transmission necessitating a significant increase in body length. The D3/6 had two axle-hung traction motors instead, and this feature became commonplace in more modern designs built after World War II.

==Design==
The locomotives are built to the specifications of LMS CME W.A. Stanier for general and hump shunting at the company&#x27;s Derby Works using engine and electric equipment supplied by the English Electric Company.

===Powertrain===
The engine and generator are supported on girders attached to the main frame via a three-point suspension with rubber vibration absorbing pads; the generator is to the rear of the engine. The locomotive body is compartmentalised, with side doors and a sliding roof allowing access. Cooling is by a front-mounted radiator, with belt-driven fan cooling.

The main generator is a direct current machine. Main control was via notched engine speed control (350, 465, 590, and 680 rpm), with finer control via secondary lever. The engine is fitted with a governor preventing overspeed, and electric overload protection.

The locomotive&#x27;s mechanical transmission consists of a single, frame-mounted traction motor powering a jackshaft drive via a reduction gear; the jackshaft drives all three driving axles via connecting rod and coupling rods. The locomotive is unusual in that most other English Electric diesel shunters (e.g. British Rail Class D3/6) have two axle-hung traction motors.

The locomotive has an inner main frame similar to steam engine practice, with the axles supported by springs attached to the frame by tensioned rods, the centre axle had side play. The jackshaft is mounted in horn guides with the reduction gear totally enclosed on the left side of the locomotive.

===Auxiliaries===
An 80-volt battery is used to energise the main generator, as well as powering the electric control system and lights, and is also used to start the engine with the generator in motor mode. The battery is automatically charged when the engine is idling. An air compressor is powered via a belt drive from the generator. Compressed air operates the Westinghouse double-wheel tread brakes, as well as the sanding equipment and the whistle.

==History and numbering==
Initially 20 of the type were ordered on Lot 141 with a number of the new design put into operation at Toton sidings by mid 1939. An order for a further 20 units was placed on Lot 156 in 1939. These forty locomotives were given LMS numbers 7080–7119.

Ten (7100–7109) were loaned to the War Department in 1941, and sold to the WD the following year. All ten survived the war; six were then sold to Egyptian Railways and four to Italian State Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato—FS) where they were matriculated as Class Ne.700.

The other 30 stayed remained in Britain and later became British Railways numbers 12003–12032. One, 12030 was withdrawn in 1964, with the remainder withdrawn during 1966/67, before TOPS classes were allocated.

==Preservation==

Although none of the British or Egyptian locomotives survive, one Italian example - 700.001 (formerly LMS No. 7103) is preserved. 700.001 was sold to industry in 1984 and preserved later on, and is on display at the Museo Ferroviario Piemontese. Another locomotive, 700.003 (ex LMS No.7106), is still in active service with Trasporto Ferroviario Toscano and regularly operates within the Arezzo province.

<doc id="1200910" wikidata="Q7444960" url="?curid=1200910" title="Security First Network Bank">
<text>Security First Network Bank (SFNB) was the first pure Internet bank in the United States. It had no physical branch bank offices and could only be accessed online. It was founded in Pineville, Kentucky, in October 1995 by Michael Karlin and James (Chip) S. Mahan III. Several months later, the bank relocated to Atlanta, Georgia.

It was initially established as a savings bank along with a wholly owned software company (Security First Technologies). Eventually teller services were added in Atlanta. On September 30, 1998, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) acquired the banking portion of the Security First Network Bank, while the software development company was spun off as S1 Corporation. RBC subsequently acquired Centura Bank of North Carolina, rebranded the online banking segment as RBC Centura, and made several adjustments to customer terms of service at that time.

Before Security First, some banks had experimented with a variety of schemes for providing online banking. Usually this involved some kind of token that was placed in an account that could only be used on the Internet. The tokens were not protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Security First allowed direct access to accounts, bill payment and the viewing of check images, all of which are commonplace today.

<doc id="1200921" wikidata="Q6935156" url="?curid=1200921" title="Multivision (television technology)">
<text>MultiVision was one of the earliest implementations of PIP (picture-in-picture) television available for purchase by users, pioneered by engineer George Schnurle III and sold by the San Jose, California-based company Multivision Products Inc.

The original MultiVision model was a box that measured by and was high. It required a VCR to operate and used its own tuner and the VCR to display two television channels. The television antenna was plugged into the MultiVision unit, which was then plugged into the television receiver&#x27;s antenna input. The program selected on the MultiVision tuner was displayed in a small window inserted into the main TV picture at a position selected by the user. It also functioned as a switching device to connect additional peripherals (such as a laserdisc player) and offered audio outputs to connect external speakers and provide stereo sound. For monaural broadcasts and VHS tapes, the device could provide synthesized stereo audio.
The MultiVision 3.1 model was an unusually shaped device, similar in size to the original, that lacked any form of controls on the device itself. It used its own two tuners and/or a VCR and/or other devices to display two video sources at once. The tunerless MultiVision 1.1 model looked virtually identical to the 3.1 except in rear view, and featured 4 composite, plus left and right audio input sets, plus switchable external audio and video processor loops. Both provided composite and left and right audio outputs for TV input.

On the 1.1 and 3.1 models, the audio could be set in sync to either the main source or the PIP or selected independently. The 1.1 model&#x27;s remote had 12 color-coded buttons, 4 each for the main picture, PIP picture, and audio, and like the 3.1&#x27;s remote included other buttons for swapping main and inset picture, PIP on/off, PIP size, PIP position, audio sync on or off, mute, and more. Their remotes featured angled output ends, which facilitated accurate button selection whilst reclined.

<text>Lyngby-Taarbæk Symfoniorkester (engl. Lyngby-Taarbæk Philharmonic Orchestra) is a full philharmonic amateur orchestra based in Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark. It consists of a mixed group of conservatory students and amateur musicians, ranging in age from the early teens to the 50s and 60s. It is usually conducted by well-known guest conductors, and complemented by solo musicians for particular pieces. It has a reputation as one of the best amateur orchestras in Denmark.

Founded in 1957 as part of the local municipal music school, it became a wholly independent orchestra in 1980. The orchestra usually takes up three projects a year, ending the season with a concert in Tivoli&#x27;s Concert Hall. The orchestra performs mostly in the greater Copenhagen area, but has in recent years visited such places as France, Sweden, Italy, UK, the Faroe Islands, Austria and Latvia. In October 2009, the orchestra visited Rotterdam in the Netherlands and performed in the Arminius Church.

<text>Porvenir is the capital of both the homonymous commune and the Chilean Province of Tierra del Fuego of the Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region. It is one of Chile&#x27;s southernmost towns, and has 4,734 inhabitants, including several thousand soldiers. It is the largest settlement in the Chilean half of the island of Tierra del Fuego.

Porvenir (Spanish for &quot;hereafter&quot; – literally &quot;yet to come&quot;) was founded in 1883 by immigrants from Croatia and Chiloé in connection to the gold mining that preceded the larger Tierra del Fuego gold rush that started in 1884.

The main sources of income are sheep farming and small-scale fishing (wrecks in Porvenir bay prevent larger vessels from mooring). In addition there is a regiment of the Chilean army and a high-security prison. An abattoir operates for only short periods of the year.

Some gold deposits remain and are commercially mined. Porvenir also gives access to Cerro Sombrero, an oil town, north-east of Porvenir.

==Demographics==

According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Porvenir spans an area of and has 5,465 inhabitants (3,307 men and 2,158 women). Of these, 4,734 (86.6%) lived in urban areas and 731 (13.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 7.1% (361 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

==Administration==
As a commune, Porvenir is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2016-2020 alcaldesa is Marisol Andrade Cárdenas .

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Porvenir is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Juan Morano (PDC) and Gabriel Boric (Ind.) as part of the 60th electoral district, which includes the entire Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region. The commune is represented in the Senate by Carlos Bianchi Chelech (Ind.) and Carolina Goic (PDC) as part of the 19th senatorial constituency (Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region).

== Tourism ==

Though tourism is expanding, most tourists pass Porvenir by, or use it simply as a stopover on their way farther south. There are several hotels, cyber-cafes, restaurants, and one gas station. A small grocery store is located near the Chilean army base on the upper level of the town, and there are several small stores and supermarkets elsewhere in town.

Access is by ferry or by air from Punta Arenas or by road from the Argentine side of the island. All ferries across the Straits of Magellan are run by Austral Broom, a Chilean company. One service runs once daily except Mondays from the port near Punta Arenas and reaches the ferry terminal about 3 km from the town of Porvenir. The other service is at the northern end of the island running from Punta Delgada to Bahia Azul.

It is possible to reach the south of Chilean Tierra del Fuego from Porvenir. The southern region has several lakes and rivers available for fishing.

== Climate ==
The climate in Porvenir is a subpolar variety (Köppen: &quot;Cfc&quot;) of the oceanic climate. Temperatures in the warmest months, January and February average while temperatures in the coolest month average . Precipitation is at around . Also, due to its latitude, the length of the day varies tremendously across the year. Winter days can have as few as seven hours of sunlight, while summer days stretch to twenty hours. Frost occurs throughout the year, and winter temperatures can remain below freezing for relatively long periods of time. Freak snowfalls can occur even in midsummer. The highest temperature was in February 2019.

<doc id="1200969" wikidata="Q298547" url="?curid=1200969" title="Mukesh Ambani">
<text>Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (born 19 April 1957) is an Indian billionaire and businessman who is the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries. He is the richest person in Asia and 9th richest in the world.

Sometimes characterized as a plutocrat, he has attracted both fame and notoriety for reports of market manipulation, political corruption, cronyism, and exploitation.

In October 2024, Ambani was ranked 1st on the Forbes list of India&#x27;s 100 richest tycoons, with a net worth of $119.5 billion.

== Early life ==
Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British Crown colony of Aden (present-day Yemen) into a Gujarati Hindu family to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani. He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar.

Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen because his father decided to move back to India in 1958 to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. The latter was originally named &quot;Vimal&quot; but later changed to &quot;Only Vimal&quot;. His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s. The family&#x27;s financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance. Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called &#x27;Sea Wind&#x27; in Colaba, where Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors.

== Education ==
Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who later became his close associate. After his secondary schooling, he studied at St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai. He then received a BE degree in chemical engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology.

Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University (where Steve Ballmer was his classmate) but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise. His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.

Ambani was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are &quot;the kind of professors who made you think out of the box.&quot;

== Career ==
Mukesh Ambani set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (later Reliance Communications Limited), which was focused on information and communications technology initiatives. At the age of 24, Ambani was given charge of the construction of Patalganga petrochemical plant when the company was heavily investing in oil refinery and petrochemicals.

Ambani directed and led the creation of the world&#x27;s largest grassroots petroleum refinery in Jamnagar, India, which could produce 660,000 barrels per day (33 million tonnes per year) in 2010, integrated with petrochemicals, power generation, port, and related infrastructure. In December 2013, Ambani announced the possibility of a &quot;collaborative venture&quot; with Bharti Airtel in setting up digital infrastructure for the 4G network in India. On 18 June 2014, Ambani said he will invest Rs 1.8 trillion (short scale) across businesses in the next three years and launch 4G broadband services in 2015.

In February 2014, a First Information Report (FIR) alleging criminal offences was filed against Ambani for alleged irregularities in the pricing of natural gas from the KG basin.

Ambani was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2016 for engineering and business leadership in oil refineries, petrochemical products, and related industries.

As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India&#x27;s philanthropists, according to China&#x27;s Hurun Research Institute. He was appointed as a Director of Bank of America and became the first non-American to be on its board. As of 2016, Ambani was ranked as the 36th richest person in the world and has consistently held the title of India&#x27;s richest person on Forbes magazine&#x27;s list for the past ten years. He is the only Indian businessman on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; list of the world&#x27;s most powerful people. He surpassed Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, to become Asia&#x27;s richest person with a net worth of $44.3 billion in July 2018. He is also the wealthiest person in the world outside North America and Europe.

As of February 2018, Bloomberg&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood Index&quot; estimated that Ambani&#x27;s personal wealth was enough to fund the operations of the Indian federal government for 20 days.

Through Reliance, Ambani also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians and is the founder of the Indian Super League, a football league in India.

==Stock manipulation and penalty==
For manipulating shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited (RPL), Reliance Industries was fined Rs. 950 crores (9.5 billion), split into 447 crores (4.47 billion) in retracted gains and 500 crores (5 billion) in interest in 2007. In April 2006, RPL went public as a Reliance subsidiary for Rs. 60 per share. The market crashed by 30% after it floated at roughly Rs. 100, and RPL was back at 60. By Securities and Exchange Board of India directive, RIL carried out an organised operation with the help of its agents to obtain unauthorised profits from the trading of its formerly listed unit, RPL, which was combined with the former in 2009.

== Personal life ==
He married Nita Ambani in 1985 and they have two sons, Akash (born 23 October 1991) and Anant (born April 10, 1995), and a daughter, Isha, who is Akash&#x27;s twin. They met after his father attended a dance performance which Nita took part in and thought of the idea of arranging a marriage between the two.

They live in Antilia, a private 27-storey building in Mumbai, which was valued at US$1 billion and was the most expensive private residence in the world at the time it was built. The building requires a staff of 600 for maintenance, and it includes three helipads, a 160-car garage, private movie theatre, swimming pool, and fitness centre.

Ambani was titled &quot;The World&#x27;s Richest Sports Team Owner&quot; after he purchased the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million in 2008.

Mukesh Ambani is a strict vegetarian and teetotaler.

During the fiscal year ending 31 March 2012, he reportedly decided to forgo nearly ₹240 million from his annual pay as chief of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). He elected to do this even as RIL&#x27;s total remuneration packages to its top management personnel increased during that fiscal year. Mukesh Ambani holds a 50.4% stake in the company. This move kept his salary capped at ₹150 million for the fourth year in a row.

In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held his younger brother, Anil Ambani, in criminal contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to Swedish gearmaker Ericsson. Instead of jail time, the court gave Anil a month to come up with the funds. At the end of the month, Mukesh Ambani bailed out his younger brother, paying the debt.
In 2021, he was the subject of a bomb scare when a green Mahindra Scorpio SUV packed with explosives was found near a Mumbai skyscraper housing Ambani. In 2023, he received a death threat via email.

On July 12 to 14, 2024, the wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant was held as a three-day event that took place at the Antilia building and Jio Convention Center in Mumbai. It had been described as India&#x27;s &quot;wedding of the year&quot; and &quot;India&#x27;s own royal wedding&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as introducing &quot;the world to [India]&#x27;s Gilded Age&quot;. Estimates for the wedding&#x27;s cost range from $300 million to $600 million, and had led to criticism regarding wealth inequality in India. Anant Ambani recently donated a crown to Lalbaugcha Raja worth 15 crores.

In 2024 he acquired a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft, becoming India&#x27;s first private owner of the aircraft. Purchased for about Rs 1000 crore, the plane will be used by the Ambani family for their long-distance travels.

<text>A subscription-based product of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), MedDRA or Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities is a clinically validated international medical terminology dictionary-thesaurus used by regulatory authorities and the biopharmaceutical industry during the regulatory process, from pre-marketing (clinical research phase 0 to phase 3) to post-marketing activities (pharmacovigilance or clinical research phase 4), and for safety information data entry, retrieval, evaluation, and presentation. Also, it is the adverse event classification dictionary. 

The first version of MedDRA was released in 1999 in English and Japanese.

MedDRA is now translated into Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. In MedDRA version 25.0, Swedish and Latvian translations were also added. 

In many countries/regions the use of MedDRA by biopharmaceutical companies is mandated for safety reporting. 
Many other industries, including tobacco and cosmetics, are also beginning to use MedDRA for capturing adverse health events.

All Regulatory Members of ICH are expected to implement MedDRA within 5 years. 

As of 2020, the following ICH Regulatory Members have implemented MedDRA: EC, Europe; FDA, United States; HSA, Singapore; Health Canada, Canada; MHLW/PMDA, Japan; Swissmedic, Switzerland; and TFDA, Taiwan.

Information about the implementation status of MedDRA by ICH Regulatory Members is updated by ICH on its website.

MedDRA is widely used internationally, with close to 7,500 subscribing organizations in almost 130 countries.
Each organization, regardless of its number of users, requires only one subscription to MedDRA.

== MedDRA Vision ==

In developing and continuously maintaining MedDRA, ICH endeavours to facilitate the exchange of clinical information through a single standardized international medical terminology that can be used for regulatory communication and evaluation of data pertaining to medicinal products for human use.
As a result, MedDRA is designed for use in the registration, documentation, and safety monitoring of medicinal products through all phases of the development life cycle.
The single standardized terminology offers several clear advantages for regulators, industry, and other stakeholders:

* Removal of the need to convert data from one terminology to another preventing the loss and/or distortion of data and allowing savings in resources;

* Improvements in the ease, quality, and timeliness of data available for effective analysis, exchange, and decision making;

* Consistency of the terminology throughout the different stages of the development of a medicinal product allowing effective cross-references and analysis of data;

* Facilitation of the electronic exchange of data relating to medicinal products.

== Organization of the dictionary ==

The MedDRA dictionary is organized with a five-level hierarchy. The highest or broadest level is System Organ Class (SOC), further divided into High-Level Group Terms (HLGT), High-Level Terms (HLT), Preferred Terms (PT), and finally into the most granular Lowest Level Terms (LLT). In addition, the MedDRA dictionary includes Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs). SMQs are groupings of terms that relate to a defined medical condition or area of interest. 

SMQs are developed to facilitate retrieval of MedDRA-coded data as a first step in investigating drug safety issues in pharmacovigilance and clinical development.

As of MedDRA 25.1, 110 SMQs have been created comprising 120 lower-level SMQs. Additional SMQs are created as the need arises.

Individual cases are usually coded for data entry at the most specific (LLT) level, and outputs of counts or cases are usually provided at the PT level. The higher levels (HLT, HLGT, and SOC), as well as SMQs, are used for searching and for organizing and subtotalling outputs. 

== MedDRA hierarchy ==

The five-level hierarchy provides degrees or levels of super-ordination and subordination. The superordinate term is a broad grouping term applicable to each subordinate descriptor linked to it. Hierarchical levels thus represent vertical links in the terminology.

Hierarchies are an important mechanism for flexible data retrieval and for the clear presentation of data. The five-level structure of this terminology provides options for retrieving data by specific or broad groupings, according to the level of specificity required. The Lowest Level Term (LLT) level provides maximum specificity.

The terminology was not developed as a formal classification or taxonomy; each level in the hierarchy may reflect a variable degree of specificity or “granularity” from one System Organ Class to another. High-Level Terms (HLTs) and High-Level Group Terms (HLGTs) facilitate data retrieval and presentation by providing clinically relevant grouping of terms. Collectively, the HLT and HLGT levels are sometimes referred to as the “grouping terms” in MedDRA.

The 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs) represent parallel axes that are not mutually exclusive. This characteristic, called “multi-axiality,” allows a term to be represented in more than one SOC and to be grouped by different classifications (e.g., by etiology or manifestation site), allowing retrieval and presentation via different data sets. Grouping terms are pre-defined in the terminology and not selected on an ad hoc basis by data entry staff. Rather, the terminology is structured so that selection of a data entry term leads to the automatic assignment of grouping terms higher in the hierarchy. Multi-axial links of terms are pre-assigned in MedDRA, ensuring comprehensive and consistent data retrieval, irrespective of which SOC is selected at data retrieval.

As of MedDRA 25.1 (September 2022):
* SOC – 27 
** The 27 SOCs are: Blood and lymphatic system disorders; Cardiac disorders; Congenital, familial and genetic disorders; Ear and labyrinth disorders; Endocrine disorders; Eye disorders; Gastrointestinal disorders; General disorders and administration site conditions; Hepatobiliary disorders; Immune system disorders; Infections and infestations; Injury, poisoning and procedural complications; Investigations; Metabolism and nutrition disorders; Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders; Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps); Nervous system disorders; Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions; Product issues; Psychiatric disorders; Renal and urinary disorders; Reproductive system and breast disorders; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders; Social circumstances; Surgical and medical procedures; Vascular disorders.
* HLGT – 337
* HLT – 1,737
* PT – 25,592
* LLT – 85,668
** LLT count represents 76,364 current terms, including PTs, and 9,304 non-current terms.

== Maintenance of MedDRA ==

MedDRA is hierarchical, multiaxial, multilingual, regularly-updated, and strictly maintained by the Maintenance and Support Services Organization (MSSO). ICH holds the intellectual property rights (ownership) of MedDRA.

MedDRA is available free for all regulators worldwide, academics, health care providers, and non-profit organizations. The subscription price is based according to company revenue for the industry. The Japanese counterpart for the MSSO is called the Japanese Maintenance Organization (JMO).

Four types of subscriptions are available from the MSSO: 

* Regulatory Authority;
* Non-Profit/Non-Commercial (such as medical library, educational institution, organization engaged in not for profit activities);
* Commercial;
* System Developer (developer of software products that utilize MedDRA).

The MSSO updates MedDRA according to subscriber change requests, for example, to add a new medical concept that is not yet in MedDRA or to change/modify an existing concept. The decisions on submitted change requests are made by a team of international medical officers on how to map the terminology within the grouping categories according to a general team consensus. The final decisions are based on multiple factors including the Points to Consider documentation, implications on legacy data, and language considerations internationally. 

The MSSO and JMO release updated MedDRA versions twice a year - in March and September. The English and Japanese translation are released on 1 March and September and all other translations are released on the 15th. The March release is the main annual release and contains changes at the HLT level and above along with LLT and PT changes. The September release contains changes only at the LLT and PT level. , Version 27.1 is the most recent version. 

The MSSO frequently incorporates feedback from the user community to stay abreast of its unique perspectives and nuanced needs. Input from these constituencies helps MSSO adapt MedDRA accordingly.

As global regulators expand the scope of product types they regulate, there is a corresponding increase in the adaptation of and interest in the proactive use of MedDRA before regulatory mandates. Such expansion has increased in MedDRA terms applicable to many product types. The addition of the 27th SOC Product issues in Version 19.0 has even further expanded use of MedDRA for product quality, supply, distribution, manufacturing and quality system issue as well as device issues.

<doc id="1200977" wikidata="Q4767381" url="?curid=1200977" title="Anna Nolan">
<text>Anna Nolan (born 16 October 1970) is an Irish television presenter, producer and former business manager, waitress and Irish international basketball player. She has presented numerous television programmes in Ireland and the UK.

==Early life==
When she was young Nolan&#x27;s mother noticed that she always ran away when young males visited and rarely dated boys. She did eventually date two men. She joined a convent in the Sisters of Loreto, and has fond memories of her time there: &quot;I loved the nuns and the work they did. They were the coolest group of women&quot;. She left after a drunken incident which confirmed for her that &quot;the Catholic church has no place for women really&quot;.

One year after leaving the convent, Nolan came out. Her mother asked her if she was gay one 1992 Saturday night about midnight when 22-year-old Nolan arrived home from her first night out in a gay bar. Her father was welcoming of her homosexuality, offering to accompany her on nights out if she wished and giving her the following advice, &quot;Anna, never underestimate that there are people out there who hate gays, would like to hurt gay people and will never accept them. You don&#x27;t have to mix with them, but they will always be there.&quot; These words returned to her when she was filming for the BBC in Australia and was accosted by &quot;an Australian right-wing homophobe living in Melbourne – a very damaged character&quot;.

==Career==
===Big Brother===
Nolan came to prominence in 2000 as the runner up in the first series of the British reality show &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Her life as a lesbian ex-nun was central to the majority of the titillation in the first series in contrast with later series when, said the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in 2007, &quot;the freakshow has ratcheted to the point where Nolan would be deemed far too Waltons Mountain for &quot;Big Brother&quot;&quot;. She was present for a part of reality television history when Craig Phillips took on &#x27;Nasty Nick&#x27; Bateman and his manipulative interferences. People ask her: &quot;Are you Anna from Big Brother?&quot; She used to deny this after losing interest but now she embraces her past. She describes her time in &quot;Big Brother&quot; as follows: &quot;There were moments when I wanted to leave due to boredom, or people irritating me, or missing people at home. Did I enjoy it? It wasn&#x27;t about enjoying it, it was about getting through it.&quot; Prior to entering &quot;Big Brother&quot;, Nolan thought nobody would watch the show as she had discussed it with two friends and &quot;One of them said, &#x27;Why on earth would anyone want to watch that?&#x27; and we changed the subject&quot;. In June 2010, &quot;RTÉ Ten&quot; named Nolan as one of its &quot;Top 10 BB Housemates&quot;.

===Presenting===
After leaving the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house, she began working in television, paving the way for future &quot;Big Brother&quot; housemates who were to do the same, such as Jade Goody, Chantelle Houghton and Nikki Grahame. Nolan worked for the BBC on two series, &quot;Anna in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Closure&quot;. She also began working for RTÉ. Nolan co-presented &quot;The Afternoon Show&quot; on RTÉ One, along with Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh. She spent three years presenting this. She announced in August 2006 that she would not be renewing her contract for the third series. She was replaced with first-season host (who was not present in season 2) Sheana Keane.

Nolan has stood in for Marian Finucane on RTÉ Radio, most memorably during the Kevin Myers &quot;bastards&quot; controversy in 2005, with the Irish media noting the irony of Nolan being a sister-in-law of Myers.

In August 2006, Nolan was a presenter of the BBC programme &quot;Inside Out&quot; when the BBC North East and Cumbria crew filmed &quot;Anomalous Phenomena Investigations&quot; of Newcastle upon Tyne, conducting a paranormal investigation at Hurworth Grange Community Centre in Hurworth-on-Tees. The show aired on 30 October 2006.

Nolan has been an occasional panellist on RTÉ Two discussion show &quot;The Panel&quot;. From 2007 to 2009 she was a reporter for the RTÉ series &quot;Would You Believe&quot;. She has cooked a meal on &quot;The Restaurant&quot;. She co-hosted &quot;Celebrities Go Wild&quot; with Aidan Power in October 2007. In December 2007, she presented &quot;Webs of Desire&quot; on RTÉ One, during which she investigated the sexual possibilities of the internet, attended a fetishist club to discuss bondage discipline sado-masochism (BDSM) with a male person and interviewed an anonymous man who was accompanied by the caption &quot;Individual Addicted to Porn.&quot; In August 2010, Nolan featured in &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;, during which Nikki Grahame felt her head.

===Producing===
In 2011, Nolan produced the show &quot;Operation Transformation&quot;. She also produced reality show &quot;Mission Beach&quot; for RTÉ. She writes a weekly column for the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;. In 2012, she directed her first documentary &quot;Perfect Heart&quot;, about one man&#x27;s wait for a heart transplant. She was series producer of the RTÉ show &quot;Room To Improve&quot; in 2012. Nolan presented &quot;The Great Irish Bake Off&quot; for TV3 and in 2014 was the Development Executive for COCO Television.
As of 2022, Nolan is Head of Development at COCO Content. She also produced the St.Patricks Day 2024 Parade coverage on RTE Television, for COCO.

==Personal life==
Nolan was in a long-term relationship with Dearbhla Walsh, an Emmy Award-winning drama director but in 2014 she told Brendan O’Connor on &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; that she &quot;had to adjust to being single&quot;.

&quot;Big Brother&quot; host Davina McCall said that Anna Nolan was the only &quot;Big Brother&quot; housemate she ever befriended and that in 2023 the two remain in contact. Nolan has also maintained contact with Craig Phillips and Mel Hill. She was also supportive of Jade Goody during her cancer battle, and met her a number of times, even though they featured in separate series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

Nolan, who was previously a sister in Dublin&#x27;s Loreto Order, today considers herself an atheist. On 10 January 2010, she hosted a special one-off programme for RTÉ One television entitled &quot;O Sister Where Art Thou?&quot; during which she attempted to track down and interview women with whom she had shared noviciate life in the order. At the end of the programme, while in conversation with a fellow former novice, she said: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in God. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a Heaven or Hell. I believe in the human spirit. I think we all make choices. I think we all have fears and for some people, when they get the fears or worries, they turn to a higher power. I just kind of deal with it. And when I go, that&#x27;s it; I&#x27;m gone into the ground and &#x27;goodbye world&#x27;. Which isn&#x27;t depressing; some people might find it depressing. And I might be wrong and that&#x27;s the good thing because if I&#x27;m wrong I&#x27;ll get into heaven(!)&quot;.

<doc id="1200978" wikidata="Q857953" url="?curid=1200978" title="God Save Our Solomon Islands">
<text>&quot;God Save Our Solomon Islands&quot; is the national anthem of Solomon Islands. It was adopted in 1978 following independence. The lyrics were authored by Fijian-born husband and wife Panapasa and Matila Balekana, and the music was composed by Panapasa.

== History ==
The anthem was composed by Fijian-born Panapasa Balekana (1929–2009) and authored together with his wife, Matila. In the run-up to independence on 7 July 1978, the government of Solomon Islands decided that it needed a national anthem for the occasion. The government announced on the radio that it would accept submissions from the general public for a new anthem.

Balekana, who had moved to Solomon Islands in 1953 to work as a government mechanic, and his wife, Matila, decided to jointly enter the competition as a team. The couple agreed that the new anthem should be in the form of a prayer, asking God to support and guide the new island nation.

Balekana claimed in interviews to have received his inspiration for the anthem in a dream. After he woke up from the dream, Balekana and his wife immediately began writing words and lyrics, as well as composing the tune. Panapasa and Matila Balekana co-wrote the lyrics for the anthem, while Panapasa composed the accompanying music. The couple credited prayer and God for their success in creating the anthem, noting how well the song came together.

Once the lyrics and music had been composed, Panapasa and Matila received help recording the prospective anthem from the Wesley United Church choir at the couple&#x27;s own congregation. The choir sang the song for the first time, which was recorded on tape and submitted to competition officials.

The Balekanas&#x27; submission, &quot;God Save Our Solomon Islands&quot;, won the competition, for which Panapasa was awarded SI$250 for the lyrics and music each, and became the national anthem of the Solomon Islands. It was sung on the country&#x27;s first independence day, 7 July 1978. Balekana was overjoyed and explained the importance of the anthem and its meaning:
:Solomon Islands national anthem was written in a form of prayer asking God for safekeeping and protection of our new nation. By the power and grace of God, we may receive joy, peace, progress and prosperity, if only we can be able to work together in harmony. These may be the foundation of building our nation, as we can be rest assured that we will reach our destinationstands forever more.

<doc id="1200987" wikidata="Q192966" url="?curid=1200987" title="Afghanistan national football team">
<text>The Afghanistan national football team (Pashto: د افغانستان د فوټبال ملي لوبډله ) is the national football team of Afghanistan and is controlled by the Afghanistan Football Federation. Founded in 1922, they played their first international game against Iran in Kabul, 1941. Afghanistan then joined FIFA in 1948 and the AFC in 1954, as one of the founding members. They play their home games at the Ghazi National Olympic Stadium in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. In 2013, Afghanistan won the 2013 SAFF Championship and earned the &quot;FIFA Fair Play Award&quot;. Afghanistan has never qualified for the AFC Asian Cup.

==History==

===Early history===
Formed in 1922 and affiliated to FIFA since 1948, the Afghanistan Football Federation was one of the founding members of the Asian Football Confederation in 1954.

The first football club established in the country, Mahmoudiyeh, was founded in 1934. Three years later the team traveled to India and took part in 18 games of which they won 8, lost 9 and drew 1. The second football club founded was Ariana Kabul which was established in 1941. This team traveled to Tehran, Iran upon invitation, played 3 games, winning one game and losing two.

Afghanistan&#x27;s only appearance and first FIFA international match was at the Olympic Games football tournament in the 1948 Summer Olympic Games when they played Luxembourg on 26 July 1948 and lost 6–0. Prior to 2002, Afghanistan was last seen on the international stage during the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualification, with its last match lost 6–1 against Jordan on 20 September 1984. Afghanistan played no international games from 1984 to 2002, due to the latter years of the Soviet–Afghan War, civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996), and the Taliban regime&#x27;s ban on recreational activities, including football.

===2001–2010===
Following the demise of the Taliban regime, the Afghan national team eventually returned to the international arena in 2002, when they played South Korea in the Asian Games, losing 2–0. Afghanistan participated in their first international tournament in the 2003 SAFF Gold Cup, where they lost all three group stage matches to India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Later in the same year, Afghanistan took part in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification where they won against Kyrgyzstan but lost to Nepal and failed to make it to the next round. 

Afghanistan started its FIFA World Cup campaign for the first time in 2003 where they played Turkmenistan in 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. They lost both matches in aggregate of 13–0. This was the first time Afghanistan participated in FIFA World Cup qualification though they had been affiliated since 1948. The team went to Pakistan to take part in the 2005 South Asian Football Federation Gold Cup, which they lost to the Maldives.

They also participated in the first edition of the AFC Challenge Cup in 2006, for which they drew both matches with Chinese Taipei and the Philippines with Afghan footballers Hafizullah Qadami and Sayed Maqsood Hashemi both scoring to produce a drawn result, and on their second world cup campaign in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification were eliminated by Syria. 

In the SAFF Championship 2008 Afghanistan lost to Bhutan but drew with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Afghanistan entered the second round of the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008, by winning in group D of the AFC Challenge Cup Qualification, drawing with Bangladesh and winning against Kyrgyzstan. In the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, Afghanistan lost all group matches to India, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. In 2009 SAFF Championship Afghanistan lost all its matches to Maldives, India and Nepal. Hashmatullah Barakzai scored Afghanistan&#x27;s only goal against Maldives in that loss.

===2014 FIFA World Cup qualification===
Afghanistan competed in their third World Cup qualifying campaign playing the first leg of their first match against Palestine in Tajikistan due to security reasons, which they lost, and the second leg of the match in Palestine which they drew with Balal Arezou scoring, meaning they failed to advance to the second round and were eliminated.

===2011 SAFF Championship===
In 2011 SAFF Championship Afghanistan defeated Bhutan 8–1, the 2nd biggest victory in the history of the Afghanistan football team. In this match, Balal Arezou scored the only hat-trick of the competition with 4 goals and the team scored the quickest goal of the tournament through Ata Yamrali in the third minute. It was Afghanistan&#x27;s first Semi-final. In the Semi-final of the tournament, the Afghans faced Nepal whom they beat 1–0 in extra time with the only goal scored by Balal Arezou in the 101st minute. It was the first win of Afghanistan over Nepal. In the final, Afghanistan played India to whom they lost 4–0.

===2012 AFC Challenge Cup===
Afghanistan defeated Bhutan 5–0 in 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification. In the first leg, they beat Bhutan 3–0 with Sidiq Walizada scoring all 3 goals, and 2–0 in the second leg. In the second qualification round, Afghanistan lost to Nepal and North Korea, whilst beating Sri Lanka but failed to qualify for the next stage.

===Afghan Premier League===
For the first time in the football history of Afghanistan the AFF announced a league where 8 teams will compete against each other. The league was established in 2012 with the first season running through September and October of that year. 8 teams were concurrently established in 2012 to become the inaugural competitors.

Players for the league were found through a reality television show called &quot;Maidan e Sabz&quot; (&quot;Green Field&quot;). The concept came from the Afghanistan Football Federation and the Afghanistan-based MOBY Group, which owns a number of TV channels and radio stations and is the largest media group in the country. MOBY Group channels will broadcast matches. Players were voted onto teams by a jury and by the television audience. Eight teams of 18 players, one from every region, were formed.

The Afghan High Peace Council has praised the creation and development of the League as an, &quot;opportunity to bring peace and stability&quot; to Afghanistan.

===2013 SAFF Championship winners===

On 20 August 2013 before the 2013 SAFF Championship Afghanistan played Pakistan in a FIFA approved friendly for the first time in 36 years. This was also the first time on home ground after a decade which ended with a 3–0 victory over Pakistan with goals from Sandjar Ahmadi, Ahmad Hatifi and Maruf Mohammadi.

Afghanistan entered the 2013 SAFF Championship as the highest ranked team by FIFA in the tournament placed at 139th. Afghanistan started the campaign with a 3-goal victory over Bhutan, with goals from Amiri also known as Afghanistan&#x27;s best ever player, Azadzoy and Barakzai. The second match again ended with a 3–1 victory over Sri Lanka with goals from Rafi, Amiri and Barakzai. The Semi-final of the tournament was the repeat of last year&#x27;s edition with Afghanistan again defeating Nepal with a solitary goal of Sandjar Ahmadi, that took Afghanistan in to the final of the tournament against India once again. Mansur Faqiryar of Afghanistan showed an outstanding goalkeeping performance by saving two back to back penalty kicks from Nepal in the last minutes of the match. The Final match of the tournament saw the 2011 SAFF Championship finalists again at Dashrath Stadium Nepal, where Afghanistan outplayed the defending champions India by 2 goals. Afghanistan showed an outstanding performance. Goals from Azadzoy and Sandjar Ahmadi in each half of the game put the Afghan football team in front, to claim their first SAFF Championship title in their history. Mansur Faqiryar was named the best player of the tournament, for his outstanding goal keeping skills throughout the tournament.

===AFC Challenge Cup 2014===
In the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup, Afghanistan did well to reach the Semi-final, losing to the eventual champions Palestine, 2–0. They finished their campaign in fourth spot, the country&#x27;s highest finishing place in the short term the cup has existed, losing to Maldives on a penalty shoot out: (7–8) after a 1–1 draw for third spot of the competition. On 10 June 2014 Afghanistan Football Federation moved from South Asian Football Federation SAFF to the CAFF. At the 2014 Ballon D&#x27;or ceremony, the Afghanistan Football Federation won the FIFA Fair Play Award. Afghanistan was honored with the award for the outstanding performance of the Afghanistan football during the year, despite the chaos of war and difficult political situations the country is facing. FIFA made a statement and posted on its website that &quot;Following a year of remarkable achievement in grassroots level football, building infrastructure to further develop football throughout the country and nurturing a professional league despite enduring over a decade of disorder stemming from war, Afghanistan has been presented the 2013 FIFA Fair Play Award.&quot;

===2018 FIFA World Cup qualification===

On 9 February 2015, it was confirmed that the AFF signed a new coach for the national team. German-Bosnian trainer Slaven Skeledzic, signed a 1-year contract with the AFF. The new trainer had earlier coached the under 17 and under 19 teams in Germany. Skeledzic played football in Germany and coached youth teams in the Bundesliga. On 27 April 2015 the AFF signed a contract with a new sponsor called Alokozay Group of Companies.

Afghanistan began the qualification with a 6–0 loss against Syria. After this match they had to play against lower ranked Cambodia. They won their first World Cup qualification match in the history of Afghanistan football. In their 3rd match against Japan, Afghanistan lost again 6–0. Against Singapore they lost 1–0. They lost 5–2 against Syria. In October 2015 the AFF forced Skeledzic to resign from his position, after the 5–2 defeat against Syria. In November 2015, the Afghan National Team announced that Petar Segrt was appointed as the new head coach. With a new coach and new players Afghanistan won their 2nd match against Cambodia with 3–0. After the qualifications the SAFF Championship started.

===2015 SAFF Championship===

This was the last edition of the SAFF Championship where the national team of Afghanistan would play. After the team was announced Afghanistan began preparing for the tournament. They were in a group of 4 countries which was: Maldives, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan. Afghanistan won the first match 4–0 against Bangladesh. After they won the second match against Bhutan 3–0 they qualified for the semi-finals. They won their last match against Maldives 4–1. In the semi-final Afghanistan had to play against Sri Lanka. The match ended in a 5–0 win for Afghanistan. Eventually after reaching the final quite easily, Afghanistan had to play against tournament favorite India. This was a replay of the finals in the 2011 and 2013 SAFF Championships. After 90 minutes the match ended in a 1–1 draw. After this moment India scored the 2–1 and won the 2015 SAFF Championship for the 7th time. Khaibar Amani was given the topscorer of the tournament award with 4 goals.

===2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification===

When the tournament ended Afghanistan still had a chance to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. After their second loss against Japan with a 5–0 defeat, Afghanistan had to win against Singapore to qualify as 4th best in their group. And so they did with a 2–1 win against Singapore and a qualification spot for the 3rd round of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

After the World Cup qualification ended, Afghanistan played some friendly games. In September against Lebanon which the game ended in a 2–0 win for Lebanon. In October against Malaysia which ended in a 1–1 draw. Before the match against Tajikistan Segrt called up 24 players which did not include the player Zohib Islam Amiri because the player previously made the decision to not play anymore for Afghanistan. But without letting Segrt know the AFF did included Amiri in the squad. Segrt disagreed with the AFF and made the decision to quit as the head coach of the national team. This was just after his 1-year anniversary with the national team. The match against Tajikistan ended in a 1–0 loss for Afghanistan. Anoush Dastgir led the team as interim coach for this match.

In February 2017, the AFF announced the signing of Otto Pfister as the new head coach of the national team. Afghanistan played a friendly game against Singapore before the Asian Cup qualification match against Vietnam. Afghanistan won the game with 2–1 with goals from Mukhammad and Azadzoy. The important Asian Cup qualification match against Vietnam ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from Hassan Amin. However, Afghanistan since then has suffered a serious setback. In the match against opponent Cambodia in Phnom Penh, which Afghanistan once defeated 4–0, Afghanistan had shocked by losing 0–1 against the same rival. Later, Afghanistan suffered second defeat, this time against Jordan, with the score 1–4 in Amman. Between two official qualification matches, Afghanistan also lost 0–2 to Oman in a friendly match. Afghanistan&#x27;s late effort later only helped them to manage a 3–3 draw against Jordan, and Afghanistan was near the verge of being eliminated if they could not defeat Vietnam in the fifth match. At the crucial match against Vietnam in Hanoi, despite Afghanistan had nearly outplayed the host, failed efforts and bad lucks had prevented Afghanistan to seal a victory, as the match ended 0–0, effectively eliminated Afghanistan from the qualification while Vietnam went to seal the ticket to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup with Jordan, after 1–0 victory over Cambodia. Afghanistan played their last match against Cambodia who also failed to qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. The match ended in a 2–1 victory for Afghanistan. After the match it was announced that Pfister will leave his job and that Anoush Dastgir will be the new head coach of the national team with the addition of Shabir Isoufi as the new assistant coach of Afghanistan. On 13 July 2018 it was announced that Afghanistan will play a friendly game in Kabul, Afghanistan for the first time since 2013 against Palestine.

===Home stadium===
Major football matches in Afghanistan are held at the Afghan Football Federation Stadium (popularly known as the Ghazi Stadium) in Kabul. It was built in 1923 during the reign of King Amanullah Khan, who is regarded as Ghazi (Hero) for the Afghan victory in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and gaining independence for his nation after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919. The stadium has the capacity to house 25,000 people. The first international football match hosted there was played between Iran and Afghanistan in 1941 and ended as a draw, 0–0. Their 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification second leg match was played at the Ghazi Stadium against Turkmenistan which Afghanistan lost 2–0, having previously lost the first leg 11–0. The stadium is maintained and controlled by the Afghanistan Football Federation. The Afghan Premier League and other local football tournaments take place in the stadium. The Ghazi Stadium was renovated in 2011 after the entire ground was removed and replaced with new soil and artificial turf placed on top. The stadium now holds bigger sporting events. The proposed construction of a new national stadium was completed in the 2013/2014 season which cost 25 million euros. In 2015, FIFA helped the AFF with the reconstruction of new youth teams and develop also women&#x27;s football for the national team.

===Kit===
Since 2002 until 2004, the Japanese sports brand ASICS was the sponsor for the national team. From 2005, the German sports brand Adidas was the sponsor of the national team until 2008. In 2009, the Danish sports brand Hummel equipped the national team. In 2011 the Afghanistan Football Federation had signed a four-year contract with Hummel, to provide both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams with all of the sportswear from 2011 to 2015. On 6 March 2015, the Afghan Football Federation signed a new four-year contract with Hummel till 2019. On 27 April 2015, the AFF signed a contract with a new sponsor called Alokozay Group of Companies. This sponsor will be on the shirts of the national team. Hummel released in 2016 the new kits for Afghanistan. It included an integrated hijab for the female Afghanistan footballers to play with while being covered from head to toe. In December 2018, Hummel announced that it will no longer sponsor Afghanistan&#x27;s football association after allegations emerged of physical, psychological and sexual abuse committed by male employees against the country&#x27;s women&#x27;s national team&#x27;s players.

===Sponsors===
Alokozay, MOBY Group, Lemar &amp; TOLO are the national team&#x27;s sponsors.

===Flag===
The Afghanistan national team still uses the old tricolor flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (the internationally recognized flag of Afghanistan) instead of the white flag of the Taliban government, despite the group&#x27;s takeover of the country in 2021.

===Rivalries===
Afghanistan is currently rivals with Pakistan in many sports, including cricket and football. The national teams of Pakistan and Afghanistan regularly held sporting events in early years, but diplomatic ties were cut after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The ensuing civil war and political instability in Afghanistan prevented the two sides from meeting again until 2003. Due to the historical, cultural and political relationship between the two countries, contests against Pakistan generate much enthusiasm amongst Afghan football fans on account of their mutual relations and have been referred to as a &quot;rivalry&quot;, although the interest in Pakistan toward the rivalry and for football in general is more muted.

<text>The Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry was edited by Hugh MacDiarmid, and published in 1940. From the introduction:

&quot;The difference … between this anthology and all previous anthologies of Scottish poetry — is that some little effort has been made to present an &quot;all-in view&quot; of Scottish poetry and in particular to give some little representation to its Gaelic and Latin elements.&quot;

It contained a number of ballads, and other anonymous verse; and translations from Latin and Gaelic. The introduction also makes the case for Lallans as a poetic language, &quot;contra&quot; Edwin Muir.

The book was given a positive review in 1941 by Louis Macneice, who ranked it with the &quot;Golden Treasury of Irish Verse&quot;, by Lennox Robinson.

<text>Henry Clay Taylor (4 March 1845 – 26 July 1904) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy who served in the American Civil War and the Spanish–American War. He also served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation and President of the Naval War College.

==Early life and Civil War service==
Taylor was born in Washington, D.C. He was appointed midshipman at the Naval Academy on 28 September 1860. When the Civil War expansion of the Navy engendered a pressing need for junior officers in the fleet, Midshipman Taylor&#x27;s class was graduated a year early. He was commissioned ensign on 28 May 1863 and posted to the steam sloop operating with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In 1864, he was transferred to the sloop-of-war , in which he visited the Mediterranean and participated in the hunt for the Confederate raider .

==Postwar service==
After the Civil War, Taylor served in a succession of ships on various stations. In 1866 and 1867, he was in with the North Atlantic Squadron, and he was assigned to from 1867 to 1868. His next tour of duty, in 1868 and 1869, was with the European Squadron in the storeship .

Between 1869 and 1880, Taylor sandwiched two tours at sea in between two periods of shore duty. His first assignment ashore—in 1869, 1870, and 1871—was at the Naval Academy. Following that, he was executive officer of , the flagship of the Pacific Squadron, from 1872 to 1874. Over the next three years, Lieutenant Commander Taylor commanded the United States Coast Survey steamer . In 1877, he came ashore once more, this time assigned to the Hydrographic Office. From there, he went to the Washington Navy Yard where he was serving at the time of his promotion to commander in December 1879.

In 1880, Commander Taylor resumed sea duty as the commanding officer of . In 1884 and 1885, he was on special duty at New York City. From 1885 to 1887, Taylor served as a member of the Board of Inspection and then took a leave of absence in 1888. In 1890, he returned to duty to command on the Asiatic Station until September 1891 when he took another leave of absence until December 1892. After six months&#x27; special duty in 1893, Taylor became President of the Naval War College.

In April 1894, he was promoted to captain. Captain Taylor assumed command of (Battleship No. 1) in December 1894. His ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, and he commanded her through the Spanish–American War in 1898.

==Flag assignments==
In the fall of 1899, Taylor was detached from &quot;Indiana&quot; and assigned to shore duty. In March 1900, he became a member of the General Board and, 11 months later on 11 February 1901, he was promoted to rear admiral. On 29 April 1902, he assumed the post of Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, which he held until his death.

Admiral Taylor was a member of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati.

==Namesakes==
Three U.S. Navy vessels have been named &quot;Taylor&quot;. The first was named for Rear Admiral Henry Clay Taylor, the second commemorates Rear Admiral William Rogers Taylor, and the third ship commemorates Commander Jesse Jr Taylor].

==Burial==
Admiral Taylor and his wife Mary Virginia are buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="1200995" wikidata="Q5333465" url="?curid=1200995" title="Economic geography of the United Kingdom">
<text>The economic geography of the United Kingdom reflects its high position in the current economic league tables, as well as reflecting its long history as a trading nation and as an imperial power. This in turn was built on exploitation of natural resources such as coal and iron ore.

Much has changed since Bevan&#x27;s speech (below) in 1945, with the coalfields largely deserted and the Empire relinquished. With its dominant position gone, the UK economic geography is increasingly shaped by the one constant: it is a trading nation.

== Regions ==
Between 1998 and 2024, the UK economy grew by 41%, with the economies of Scotland (38%), Wales (40%) and Northern Ireland (38%) growing at varying rates.

The GDP of each area of the UK varies tremendously, with London having 10 times the GDP of Northern Ireland in 2022; while London and the South East of England made up over a third of the national GDP, Northern Ireland, Wales and the North East of England combined made up less than a sixth.

The GDP per capita showed similar variations with London having a GDP per head of £56,000 compared with the North East of England at £23,000 in 2024.

Different regions also see different rates of unemployment; in early 2024, the average UK unemployment rate was 4.3%, ranging from the East Midlands at 5.6% to Northern Ireland at 2.1%. 

== Agriculture, fossil fuels and manufacturing ==

=== Agriculture ===
The UK has rarely been self-sufficient in terms of food supply. In 2023, the country was 54–60% self-sufficient in food. In 2022, the country produced enough sheep and milk to be self-sufficient, and almost enough poultry, eggs and cereals, but other foods, such as rice, tomatoes and exotic fruits, had to be imported. Its modern pattern of agriculture reflects a combination of history, current public policy and comparative advantage.

Since the Enclosure Acts of the eighteenth century, the UK&#x27;s uplands (including Wales and the Scottish Highlands) have largely been associated with animal husbandry and forestry. However, by the time of the Enclosure Acts, most of lowland Britain was already enclosed by processes such as assarting or illegal, but tolerated, piecemeal enclosure. However, evidence of the former open field system of agriculture can still be seen in some parts of the landscape, such as in the indentations remaining from boundary ditches of the former farming strips. Enclosure, in turn, led to intensification.

Most UK agriculture is intensive and highly mechanised, with the use of chemical fertilisers and insecticides routine. By European standards it is very efficient, although that does not necessarily make it profitable. This intense nature was compounded in the post-War years, with fields being expanded at the expense of hedgerows. This process has been heavily criticised for damaging biodiversity.

East Anglia and South East England have been centres for grain production, with some areas of South East England also specialising in market gardening. The county of Kent was so well known for this that it is often referred to as the &quot;Garden of England&quot; and was particularly noted for hop growing. Dairy farming is most prevalent in South West England.

Northern Ireland is self-sufficient in food production and is able to export more than half of its meat and crops to the rest of the UK and beyond.

The detailed pattern of modern UK agriculture was heavily influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union, with a combination of price support and set-aside policy.

Around the edges of south eastern towns, perfectly good agricultural land often remains uncultivated as a result of price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the housing crisis (see below). It is hard to see when such plots could come back into production.

=== Fossil fuels ===
The UK&#x27;s industry sector was once dominated by the coal; heavily concentrated in south Wales, north and south Staffordshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire, South Yorkshire, Northumberland, County Durham, Fife and Midlothian. The number of pits and miners have been slashed, and output fell by more than 75% between 1981 and 2003. The remaining pits produced 17.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2003, making the UK the 15th largest coal producing nation, compared with 4th in 1981, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2004. In 2021, the country had seven coal mines in operation, employing just over 6,000 people.

The major primary fossil fuel industry in the UK is North Sea oil. Its activity is concentrated on the east coast in Scotland and Northern England. The waters in the North Sea off the east coast of Scotland contain nearly half of the UK&#x27;s remaining oil reserves, and a quarter of reserves are located in the North Sea near the Shetland Islands. As of January 2004, the UK had proven crude oil reserves of 4.7 billion barrels (750,000,000 m³) including onshore reserves, according to the &quot;Oil and Gas Journal&quot;. However, the number of people employed in this industry dropped dramatically during the 2010s.

A closely related industry is natural gas which, since the 1970s, has supplied all of the UK gas needs, replacing poisonous coal, or town, gas. Most natural gas production is in the North Sea, with a small amount onshore and in the Irish Sea. The largest reserves not related to oil production are in the southern North Sea between the UK and the Netherlands, although; the largest reserves, are associated with oil production. The UK has been a net natural gas importer since 2010.

=== Manufacturing ===

Northern Ireland – In 2022, manufacturing jobs employed 88,000 people, or 11% of the workers in the region.
At one time or another virtually every product that can be imagined has been made in the UK. In particular its heavy manufacturing drove the Industrial Revolution, starting with the first blast furnace at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire.

A map of the major UK cities gives a good picture of where manufacturing flourished, and often specialisations could be identified, in particular:
*Birmingham (automotive)
*Glasgow (shipbuilding)
*London (various)
*Manchester (textiles)
*Bradford (textiles)
*Newcastle (shipbuilding and steel)
*Nottingham (apparel, medicine)
*Stoke-on-Trent (ceramics)
*Sheffield (steel and steel products)
*Leeds (textiles and engineering)
*Belfast (shipbuilding and textiles)
*Cardiff (steel)

The automotive industry can be traced back to the 1890s (growing after World War I), by which time industries such as shipbuilding, textiles and steel were already established.

In the inter-War years modern industries emerged, with aerospace forming clusters around London, Bristol and in Hertfordshire. The Hertfordshire cluster no longer exists. The early electronics industry generally preferred the south, especially the home counties.

Today there is no heavy manufacturing industry in which UK-based firms can be considered world leaders and no product in which a UK city or region is &quot;the&quot; world leader.

However, the Midlands, in particular, remains a strong manufacturing centre, with around a fifth of employment dependent on manufacturing, and the East Midlands Development Agency has a policy to maintaining this characteristic.

More recently, high technology firms have concentrated largely along the M4 motorway, partly because of access to London Heathrow Airport, but also because of the economies of agglomeration. However, the general pattern remains that the south has lower, and falling, reliance on manufacturing.

== Finance and services ==

Once, every great city had a stock exchange. Now, the UK financial industry is concentrated overwhelmingly in the City of London and Canary Wharf, with back office and administrative operation often dispersed around the south of England.

London is one of the world&#x27;s great financial centres, which is one of the factors that is commonly considered to make it a world city. Central London contains some of the most expensive commercial property in the world because of this.

From around the early 1990s London has been able to boast of having more U.S. banks than New York, as well as being host to branches of more than five hundred overseas banks. It is the principal financial centre of the world, ranked alongside New York and Tokyo as one of three where any serious financial player &quot;must&quot; be represented.

The City of London has around 300,000 employees, largely concentrated in the financial and professional sectors.

Within London, the desire for banks to be there put pressure on the City of London&#x27;s ability to accommodate them. In the mid-1980s a crisis point was reached and, although the city was able to expand its stock of modern office space, this did not happen before Canary Wharf had been set up as a competitor. The irony is that Canary Wharf was built in the London Docklands that had, until 1970, been among the largest docks in the world. All manner of goods had been shipped from the factories of east London to the world; between 1961 and 1993 manufacturing employment in London fell from 1.6 million to 328,000.

During the mid-1990s, Leeds took advantage of the internet&#x27;s arrival as part of the .com boom. It became the UK&#x27;s first city to have full broadband and digital coverage, making it a very attractive place for corporations to expand, particularly when opening call centres. During the changing 1990s, Leeds had better connections to London than any other UK city, being 2 hours from London by train. As a result, it is now the UK&#x27;s 2nd largest financial and legal centre, and the UK&#x27;s largest e-business sector with more than 1/3 of the UK&#x27;s internet traffic passing through the city.

In this respect, Canary Wharf and Leeds are arguably more symbolic of the changed economic geography of the UK than any other place.

Edinburgh is the 2nd financial capital of the UK.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, there were 2.3 million people employed in financial services in the UK; financial centres included Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast, London and several cities in England. The country was also the world’s leading net explorer of financial services in 2020. 

By 2023, there were 2.5 million people employed in the industry, making up 12% of the UK economic output.

<text>Cape Kidnappers, known in Māori as  and officially gazetted as Cape Kidnappers / Te Kauwae-a-Māui, is a headland at the southeastern extremity of Hawke&#x27;s Bay on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island and sits at the end of an peninsula which protrudes into the Pacific Ocean. It is south-east of the city of Napier. Access to the cape by road stops at Clifton, which is the departure point for many tourists visiting the gannet colony. The Cape Kidnappers Golf Course lies between the headland and the nearby coastal community of Te Awanga.

The cliffs towards the cape are made up of sandstone, conglomerate, mudstone, river gravel, pumice and silt.
The land surrounding the cape and the gannet colony comprises large working farms grazing sheep and cattle. The peninsula, including farm land and the bird colony locations, is enclosed in a predator-proof fence built in 2007 to prevent introduced predators such stoats, ferrets, and feral cats re-invading the headland after a successful and still ongoing pest-control programme.

==History==
The headland was named after an attempt by local Māori to, according to Captain Cook, abduct a member of Cook&#x27;s crew aboard HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, during a landfall there on 15 October 1769. The crew member was Taiata, the 12 year old nephew or servant of Tupaia, the Tahitian arioi who served as the &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s interpreter and guide. Cook&#x27;s journal states that Taiata was over the side of the ship when a Maori fishing vessel approached the &quot;Endeavour&quot; offering to trade fish, before seizing the boy and attempting to flee with him. Sailors from &quot;Endeavour&quot;′s deck immediately opened fire on the fishing boat, killing two Māori and wounding a third.

Ngāti Te Whatuiāpiti&#x27;s perspective is that Rangatira Te Rangikoianake and his son Hawea led a rescue party in order to free what they thought was a young Māori boy being held captive on the ship. This history was acknowledged in the 2015 Heretaunga Tamatea Deed of Settlement with the Crown.

Taiata promptly jumped overboard and swam back to &quot;Endeavour&quot;, while the remaining Māori paddled their craft back to shore. A 4-pounder cannon was fired after them from &quot;Endeavour&quot;′s quarterdeck, but the Māori boat was soon out of range.

Cook described the cape as having steep white cliffs on either side, with two large rocks resembling hay stacks near the headland.

Following the passage of the Heretaunga Tamatea Claims Settlement Act 2018, the name of the headland was officially altered to Cape Kidnappers / Te Kauwae-a-Māui. The Māori portion of the name refers to &#x27;the fish hook of Māui&#x27;, referring to a legend in which the North Island is a large fish which was caught by the demigod Māui.

==Important Bird Area==
The cape has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for over 6500 pairs of Australasian gannets. The numbers have steadily increased in the past two decades, making this gannet colony the largest and most accessible mainland colony in the world.
The gannet nesting season is from mid-September to mid-December, with the juvenile chicks staying as late as May to migrate to Australia.

Tourists can either reach the cape and gannet colony by walking along the coast, or by private minibus tours via an inland road that was built to service the golf course and resort.
A tour along the coast with passenger trailers pulled by a tractor operated for more than 70 years before closing in 2023. This came after the beach track was closed and the tours suspended for two years following a landslide in 2019 that injured two tourists.

<text>A parochial church council (PCC) is the executive committee of a Church of England parish and consists of clergy and churchwardens of the parish, together with representatives of the laity. It has its origins in the vestry committee, which looked after both religious and secular matters in a parish. It is a corporate charitable body.

Legally the council is responsible for the financial affairs of the church parish and the maintenance of its assets, such as churches and church halls. It also assists the clergy in the management of church affairs in the parish, and promoting the mission of the church.

==History==
Until 1894, the vestry committee managed both the secular and religious business in a parish. The 1894 Local Government Act took away its secular duties and gave them to the newly created civil Parish Councils. Church business continued to be managed by the vestry committee until 1921, when PCCs were created after the &quot;Rules for the Representation of the Laity&quot; was adopted in 1919 by the Convocations of Canterbury and York. Most of the remaining functions of vestry meetings of parishes, and of the churchwardens of parishes, which had not been transferred to civil local authorities were transferred to PCCs by the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1921. (Measures passed by the Church Assembly, now replaced by the General Synod of the Church of England, are given the force of law by Act of Parliament, the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919.)

PCCs are constituted under the Church Representation Rules (Schedule 3 to the Synodical Government Measure 1969).

==Powers and duties==
The powers and duties of PCCs are laid down by the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1956. They include the duty to co-operate with the minister (rector, vicar or priest in charge) &quot;in promoting in the parish the whole mission of the Church, pastoral, evangelistic, social and ecumenical.&quot;

The PCC is responsible for the financial affairs of the church, and the care and maintenance of the church fabric and its contents, including demanding chancel repair liability, if applicable, from local property owners. These responsibilities are executed by churchwardens, paid staff or other volunteers. The PCC also has a voice in the forms of service used by the church and may make representations to the bishop and deanery synod on matters affecting the welfare and pastoral care of the parish.

The PCC is required to appoint a church electoral roll officer who maintains the church electoral roll of lay members entitled to take part in the annual parochial church meeting. A new roll must be prepared every 6 years, and revised annually.

==Membership==
The constitution of a PCC is prescribed by the Church Representation Rules, Part 9.

A PCC consists of (i) the clergy of the parish, (ii) certain lay people licensed to the parish, (iii) the churchwardens of the parish, (iv) members of the General Synod, diocesan synod or deanery synod who are on the roll of the parish, and (v) representatives of the laity elected at the annual parochial church meeting. To be qualified for election as a representative of the laity, a person must be of the laity, an actual communicant, aged 16 or over, and not disqualified (e.g. by conviction of certain offences, disqualification as a company director or entry on a &quot;barred list&quot;), and must be on the church electoral roll (and, unless under 18, have been on the roll for at least 6 months); he or she must be nominated and seconded by persons on the roll, and be willing to serve.

Churchwardens are elected at an annual Meeting of Parishioners pursuant to the Churchwardens Measure 2001. Churchwardens are &quot;ex-officio&quot; members of the PCC and its standing committee. Other parish post-holders, such as the secretary, treasurer and sidesmen, are appointed by the PCC.

==Charitable status==
Many PCCs are registered charities. &quot;The advancement of religion&quot; is a charitable purpose under the Charities Act 2011. The Charity Commission considers the legal duty of a PCC – to promote &quot;the whole mission of the Church, pastoral, evangelistic, social and ecumenical&quot; – to be charitable, so all PCCs have charitable purposes, regardless of whether they are registered with the Charity Commission. Members of a PCC are trustees of the charity. PCCs with income of more than £100,000 must register with the Charity Commission; those with lower incomes are &quot;excepted charities&quot; which means that they do not have to register or submit annual returns, but otherwise are regulated just like registered charities.

<text>Hermann Grab (May 6, 1903 – August 2, 1949) was a Bohemian German-language writer, critic and musician. He is known for writing Der Stradtpark in 1935 and Hochzeit in Brooklyn, which was published in 1957 after his death. 

==Early years==
Hermann was born into a wealthy aristocratic family of Jewish origin in Prague, Bohemian Kingdom (an old name of today&#x27;s Czech Republic). Although his parents were formally Jewish, Hermann and his brother were educated as Catholics. Hermann studied at the German Gymnasium Na Prikopech (Prague) and then entered German Charles-Ferdinand University. Later he studied at universities in Berlin, Heidelberg and Vienna. In 1927, he received a PhD in philosophy in Heidelberg and in 1928 a PhD in law in his home-town Prague.

==Life in Prague and writer work==
After short juridical praxis, Grab became a music teacher and music-critic of Prager Montagsblatt. In 1934, he published the first of his short stories in Prague magazines and in 1935 his first book, &quot;Der Stadtpark&quot;, a Prague novel, for he was said to be &#x27;Prague Proust&#x27; (Joseph Strelka).

==Exile in the United States and death==
After the occupation of his country by Hitler between 1938 and 1939, Grab escaped to Paris. When Hitler&#x27;s armies defeated France, he escaped (and lost all his manuscripts) through France, Spain, Portugal, and finally to the USA. Hermann settled in New York City and established a small music school, married a Belgian exile and wrote his second book, &quot;Hochzeit in Brooklyn&quot;. Serious illness prevented him from returning to Prague after World War II. Hermann was diagnosed with cancer in 1946. He died of cancer fully invalid in 1949 in New York and was buried at Flushing Cemetery in Flushing, Queens, New York City.

==Works of Hermann Grab==
*&quot;Der Stadtpark&quot; (Town Park), novel published in Prague 1935. Prague&#x27;s pre-World War I life seen by a teenager.
*&quot;Hochzeit in Brooklyn&quot; (Marriage in Brooklyn), a book of excellent short stories, written in 1940s, published posthumously in Vienna 1957. Some of them with a Prague theme, others with New York and Lisbon theme.

The range lies between the city of Napier, to the southeast, and Lake Taupō, to the northwest. It is the source of many rivers which flow into Hawke Bay, including among them the Tutaekuri, Mohaka, and Ngaruroro Rivers.

The highest point in the range is Kaweka J (). The bush line varies from 1000 m to 1300 m.

A tramping track follows the ridge line of the entire range. The Kaweka challenge is a running race held annually in the range since 1990.

<text>The Coventry Blaze are a British professional ice hockey team based in Coventry, England. They currently compete in the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) and play their home games at SkyDome Arena. The club was founded in 1965 as the original &quot;Solihull Barons&quot; and renamed the &quot;Solihull Blaze&quot; in 1996, before relocating to Coventry at the turn of the millennium. The Blaze have won four Elite Ice Hockey League Championships since the formation of the league in 2003.

==Club history==
===Seasons===

====1965–1996: Early history====
====1996–2000: Solihull Blaze====
The Solihull Barons evolved into Solihull Blaze before the start of the 1996–97 season, finishing second in the southern division of the British National League during the league&#x27;s inaugural season. For the following season the team joined the newly formed &quot;national division&quot; of the English National Ice Hockey League for its inaugural season; during which members of the higher division played a dual set of fixtures; one set amongst themselves and another amongst all of the teams within the ENIHL. This season was one of the most successful on record as Blaze were victorious in both competitions and their respective play-offs. Nine goals in each leg of the play off final against Chelmsford Chieftains gave Blaze their third trophy of the season.

The Blaze left the ENIHL along with the rest of the national division during the course of the 1998–99 season, with the division becoming the English Premier League. In November 1998, they were losing finalists in the English Cup, but the side were once again crowned league champions in March with a victory in Chelmsford on 20 March. Play-off success followed in April with a 5–3 two-legged victory over season-long rivals, Milton Keynes Kings.

For the following season Blaze returned to the BNL; and made a semi-final appearance in the 1999–2000 BNL play-offs, losing to eventual winners Fife Flyers, having finished in seventh position in their first year back at British National League level. In May 2000, the club announced that they would be heading to a new 3,600-seater stadium, the Coventry SkyDome Arena, for the 2000–01 BNL campaign; renaming themselves &quot;Coventry Blaze&quot; in the process. This was done for the purpose of attracting a larger fan base to the team.

====2000–2003: Coventry Blaze====
With eight new players on board the Blaze started their inaugural season at the Skydome with a decent run in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and, after losing in their opening BNL game, proceeded to set an impressive pace in the league competition throughout October and November. The loss of key players, Craig Chapman (returned to US) and Steve Chartrand (injury) at the turn of the year were possible contributions to a dip in form which resulted in an eventual fourth-place finish. In the playoffs Blaze were unable to repeat the previous years semi-final appearance. However, the most important factor of the year was the growth in fan base from a few hundred at the start of the year to over 2000 by the end of the play-offs.

Season 2001–02 saw few changes in the line up (Canadian Ian Burt replacing Henrik Sjodin in goal, Andrew McNiven joining in place of AJ Kelham and Steve Carpenter returning to Blaze colours being the main changes.) The Season started with a run of good results in the Findus Challenge Cup which saw Blaze qualify for the Semi-Finals. This run included the first return visit to Hobs Moat Road in Solihull to take on the reformed Barons (both games saw Blaze victorious). An injury to Andrew McNiven saw ex-Steeler/Panther/Giant Steve Roberts join up with the Blaze. An impressive October/November saw the Blaze matching new-boys Dundee Stars all the way. The Finals weekend of the Challenge Cup saw Blaze comeback from 3–0 down in the semi-final to beat Basingstoke Bison and go on to meet Fife in the final, which the Flyers went on to win. Returning to the league, and the Blaze continued in fine form throughout splitting results with the Stars. Stars greater consistency, and their ability not to drop points against mid-table teams left them top of the league with the Blaze runners-up again. The play-offs saw the Blaze top their qualification group and then beat Guildford Flames over the two legged semi-final. The Final saw them take on the Stars and lose out by the narrowest of margins, 8–7, over the two legs, and for the third time in the season Blaze were runners-up.

Season 2002–03 saw another evolution not revolution in the playing staff with Jody Lehman replacing Burt in goal, Joel Poirier replacing the departed Roberts, and GB forward Ashley Tait joining the team. Blaze entered the Ice Hockey Superleague (ISL) Challenge Cup at the start of the season, and ran a couple of ISL teams close. The Findus Challenge Cup saw Blaze into the Finals where they met the Newcastle Vipers, but the result was a 0–3 loss. A run of form following the defeat saw the Blaze wrap up the league title with a victory in Dundee. This was followed up with an unbeaten play-offs run, the Final being contested against Cardiff Devils, and a narrow victory in Cardiff was followed by a first ever capacity crowd (2750) at the Skydome for a triumphant night that saw Blaze lift their second trophy of the year. Shortly after the final, Blaze announced their move into the newly formed Elite Ice Hockey League, and commenced preparations for their first ever season in the top flight of British ice hockey.

====2003–04 season====
Season 2003–04 saw another major change in the club&#x27;s progress as they took part in their first season as a top-flight club in the newly formed Elite League. Coach Paul Thompson stayed true to the team which had won the double in the BNL the year before, replacing only three players; defencemen Steve O&#x27;Brien and Steve Gallace coming from the ECHL to replace Andreas Moborg and Ron Shudra and college-graduate Graham Schlender replacing folk-hero Kurt Irvine. The first game of the league saw another first for the club as they flew to their game in Belfast and beat the previous year&#x27;s Superleague playoff champions. A 6–1 win over Sheffield in October and an 11–0 victory over Manchester Phoenix in December were highlights as the team stayed close the leaders at the top of the table up until Christmas.

In the New Year, Blaze fell back and wins were hard to come by, but they still finished third in their first year in the top flight. The playoffs however, got off to an awful start as they lost in Cardiff minus coach Thompson, serving a one match ban following a bench clearance against the Devils the weekend before. With only four games in the group stage, Blaze were unable to get going after that loss and ended the season by finishing winless in the post-season.

====2004–05 season====

If the previous season had finished disappointingly, season 2004–05 ended in the best possible way after the greatest seven months in the club&#x27;s history. Although stalwarts such as netminder Jody Lehman and new captain Ashley Tait returned, coach Thompson changed many, bringing in more size, more speed and more quality. His greatest coup was signing former-Superleague defenceman Neal Martin, who went on to become the league&#x27;s Player of the Year and selected to the EIHL All-Star Team. The brand-new first line of Dan Carlson, Adam Calder and Andre Payette proved potent all through the season, as Carlson&#x27;s speed and vision proved the perfect set-up for Calder&#x27;s finishing and play around the net, while Payette angered many by clocking up almost 500 penalty minutes. The season started well as they qualified from their group for the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup, kept with the early pace-setters at the top of the league and even got over the disappointment of losing out on NHL forward Eric Beaudoin on a lock-out deal by bringing in high-scoring centreman Chris McNamara.

The turning point in Blaze&#x27;s season came in November, as Thompson cut Slovak Michal Vrabel and brought in Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; NHL defenceman Wade Belak, sparking a run to the end of the regular season where they only lost once in regulation time. A Doug Schueller goal against Nottingham Panthers sent Coventry to their first Challenge Cup final with a 5–4 aggregate victory, before they beat Cardiff 6–1 in the first leg of the final. A fight-strewn second-leg a week later saw Coventry battle under pressure to win the game 5–4; securing their first trophy of the season, 11–5 on aggregate. As Cardiff faltered, the league eventually became a two-horse race between Coventry and Belfast. Blaze eventually they had the chance to wrap up the title with three games to go in front of a new record crowd at the Skydome, Coventry dispatched of London Knights 5–1 and secured their place as the number one team in Britain.

Now the bid was on to add the Playoff crown to their trophy cabinet. After qualifying from their playoff group for their first finals weekend, a Jody Lehman shutout helped Blaze beat Sheffield Steelers 3–0 in their semi-final. The Playoff Final against the home-town Nottingham Panthers was tight and eventually went into sudden-death overtime tied at 1–1. But just over three minutes into the extra session, captain Ashley Tait scored the game-winner, securing Coventry Blaze&#x27;s place in British Ice Hockey history as winners of the elusive Grand-Slam.

====2005–06 season====
In the 2005–06 season, Coventry Blaze faced the enormity of trying to emulate their grand slam success, but before it had even begun they had suffered losses, with their entire first line and netminder moving on, as well as three key players retiring. With replacements acquired, the team began slowly, edging into the Challenge Cup semis whilst trying to keep with the early pace-setters in the league. The season high came when Blaze were British representatives in the Continental Cup group stages, winning and drawing their opening two games before falling to French hosts Grenoble in the final, deciding game. Blaze took a three-goal lead in a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s Challenge Cup final against Cardiff, but could not defend this in the second leg. The Devils wiped out the advantage, with the final goal 20 seconds from time, and were the only team to score in the deciding penalty shootout to win the competition.

The remaining months offered little success as the team finished fourth and then failed to make the playoff semis. Their last chance at success came in the final of the newly created British Knockout Cup in front of a new record Skydome crowd, but resulted in another shootout loss.

====2006–07 season====

With a wholesale revamp of the team, the 2006–07 season saw Coventry taking to the ice vastly more experienced for the challenge from back to front. League All-Star Trevor Koenig to goal proved to be the team&#x27;s key signing, and the partnership of the Grand-Slam year was reformed as Adam Calder and Dan Carlson both returned. They were combined with proven past winners like Sylvain Cloutier, Samy Nasreddine, former NHL player Rumun Ndur, Reid Simonton and Danny Stewart.

Despite reigning champions Belfast pulling away at the top of the league, Blaze quietly qualified for both cup finals without defeat and maintained a steady pace behind the Giants. Come early February, Blaze had cut the 11-point lead Belfast held at Christmas, and when the two met at the Skydome, an 8–0 win in Coventry&#x27;s favour proved a massive turning point. They were run close, but a home win against Edinburgh with a few games remaining secured Blaze&#x27;s second Elite League championship in three years. A week later a second trophy was in the cabinet – a 5–1 win in Sheffield brought the Challenge Cup back to Coventry. The other two trophies eluded them thanks to the Cardiff Devils, with a 3–0 shutout on SkyDome ice in the Knockout Cup final followed up by a 3–2 success in the playoff semi-finals.

====2007–08 season====
Blaze entered the 2007 season with the majority of the Championship team retained. Captain Ashley Tait departed after a five-year stay and was replaced by fellow British international Jonathan Weaver in the team&#x27;s big transfer story, while sniper Curtis Huppe arrived from Belfast and past-servants of the club, Russ Cowley and Matt Soderstrom, returned to Coventry for the 2007–08 season. Despite relinquishing the Challenge Cup early on with failure to escape their group and make the semis, Blaze started strong in the league and kept going throughout the season. They were the British representatives in the Continental Cup once more, this time in Aalborg, Denmark, and although they ultimately missed out on a place in the next round, they produced one of the greatest results in the club&#x27;s history – a 3–2 overtime comeback win against Austrian champions Red Bull Salzburg. Domestically, Adam Calder, ably assisted again by partner Dan Carlson, proved to be Blaze&#x27;s main weapon. The Canadian scorer had a career season, hitting 58 goals and 125 points in Elite League competitions as he ended the year the club&#x27;s and the league&#x27;s MVP.

Blaze held off their challengers to finally seal a second successive, and third overall, Elite League title. By this time Coventry had also reached the Knockout Cup final against Basingstoke, but they needed a four-goal burst in the final period of the second leg to seal a second trophy of the season – one which had proved elusive on two previous occasions. In the playoffs Blaze reached the final against league runners-up Sheffield, but a 2–0 shutout backstopped by Blaze&#x27;s grand-slam goalie Jody Lehman eluded them of another treble.

====2008–09 season====
The 2008–09 season resulted in the club winning no major silverware for the first time in three years.

The club reacted to losing key members of their team, in All-Stars Trevor Koenig and Neal Martin and captain Sylvain Cloutier, by building a young, mobile roster designed to last the distance. However, they lacked consistency in key areas and went through periods of poor form. All of Head Coach, Paul Thompson&#x27;s new signings were familiar to British hockey bar two – Scott Kelman and Corey LeClair – who both arrived from the ECHL.

The first half of the season saw good progress, with the club taking the Charity Shield in overtime against Sheffield and qualifying for the Challenge Cup semi finals. A third representation by the club at the Continental Cup saw a winner-takes-all final game against hosts Bolzano, where a disallowed Coventry goal proved the major turning point in an eliminating 1–0 defeat.

Come January 2009 though Blaze started to falter – Kelman and LeClair were replaced after failing to adapt to the British league and the Knockout Cup was relinquished against Belfast over two legs. The changes in personnel failed to bring enough of a change in fortunes, with Coventry falling over two legs to the Giants again in the Challenge Cup semis before finishing 11 points behind Sheffield to take second in the Elite League title race. The last hope of a trophy came in the playoffs, but Nottingham provided a final devastation with a 6–2 defeat.

====2009–10 season====
Coventry Blaze celebrated their 10th anniversary season in 2009–10 with a third Elite League title in four seasons, making it 10 trophies in 10 seasons since the move to the city in the summer of 2000.

Coach Paul Thompson&#x27;s new signings were key as Coventry recovered from being runners-up the previous year to title winners again. Peter Hirsch was added as netminder, Brian Lee was installed on the blue-line, whilst Greg Chambers and Luke Fulghum brought goals up front.

The season started with a Challenge Cup run that fell at the group stage, but the Elite League&#x27;s newly created 20–20 hockey tournament proved more of a success and Blaze were losing finalists to the Sheffield Steelers. With the cups removed from the priority list, the league became Coventry&#x27;s main focus for six months, and the race for its title was to become one of the closest fought for years, going all the way to the final weekend.

To avoid a final day showdown with second-placed Belfast, Coventry as narrow leaders needed to win their penultimate game in Edinburgh. Blaze gained a two-goal lead, but with a minute to go found themselves a goal down and the big title-decider against the Giants looked likely. But Captain Adam Calder tied the scores with only 28 seconds remaining and took the game to OT, before his hat-trick goal sealed the comeback and the league championship. However, despite making the Playoff Semi-Finals for a fourth year running, they were well-beaten in Nottingham by the Cardiff Devils.

====2010–11 season====


The 2010–11 season resulted in no silverware for the Blaze.

There were not many changes from the team that won the league championship the previous season. Brett Jaeger replaced Peter Hirsh in goal whilst Canadian blueliners Brad Zanon and Jeff Smith were signed in place of long-time defenceman Tom Watkins, who moved to Telford Tigers as player-coach, and the retiring Jason Robinson. Up-front Owen Fussey was signed from rivals Edinburgh Capitals to replace the team&#x27;s highest goal scorer Adam Calder.

The season did not start well with four consecutive defeats against Belfast and Nottingham leaving the Blaze at the bottom of the league table, but even a club record 12 game unbeaten run between the end of September and middle of November did not help them catch up with the leaders. From then on Blaze lost more games than they won and the result was 6th in the league standings – Coventry&#x27;s worst finish in their 11-year history. Injuries were blamed for the downturn, particularly to key imports, with defenceman Jeff Smith, Brian Lee and Jonathan Weaver all requiring lengthy lay-offs which resulted in Blaze calling up inexperienced players from their ENL team as well as bringing back Jason Robinson from retirement in America to help plug the gaps on the blueline. The situation was just as bad in attack with goalscorer Owen Fussey sidelined after 34 games with a knee injury and Brad Cruikshank forced to serve a lengthy ban for his involvement in a bench clearance against rivals Nottingham in a game at the SkyDome.

Away from the league there was just as little success. A strong start in the Challenge Cup soon faltered and Blaze failed to progress from the group stage, and in the playoffs the team failed to reach the finals weekend in Nottingham after suffering a 3–4 overtime loss against Belfast in the quarter finals. As defending league champions Blaze once again were Britain&#x27;s representatives in the Continental Cup, and made a strong bid to reach the superfinals of the competition with 6–1 victories in their first two group games before falling 3–7 to the hosts in Rouen.

====2011–12 season====
In December 2011, it was announced by the club that the Blaze were in financial difficulties due to the economic climate and events outside of their control. The Blaze issued a press statement announcing Blaze Action Month, asking the fans to get behind the club by purchasing game tickets and buying merchandise in order to raise funds.

====2012–13 season====
The 2012–13 was the 10th season for the Coventry Blaze in the Elite Ice Hockey League.

==Club jerseys==

Each season the club releases a new set of jerseys. The club always wear their blue jerseys for home games, this will consist of a royal blue for the main color along with a dark blue and white sections on the jersey. The away jersey will have the same base design but this jersey will be white for the main color and the royal blue replacing the white sections on the home jersey and the dark blue sections remain the same.

The club wears special edition jerseys with different designs on them celebrating Christmas, Halloween, Easter etc.

==Mascot==

Scorch the dragon is the official Coventry Blaze mascot. Scorch is infamous for his unique dance moves, he interacts with fans of all teams when they visit the Skydome arena. Scorch can often be found before and during a game walking around the rink being mischievous with fans and taking photos. During the pre-game introduction Scorch skates onto the ice and throws tennis balls into the crowd for fans to catch, each ball contains a Blaze players number. The fan with the tennis ball numbered after the first player to score in that night&#x27;s game will win a prize. During the second period break, scorch participates in chuck a puck.

Scorch has been played by various volunteers over their twenty years in Coventry. Each person has kept up the persona of Scorch being mischievous and playful.

Le Febvre was then replaced by first Steven Goertzen in a short term role in November 2014, and then a month later replaced by Chuck Weber who agreed to coach until the end of the season. 

After an initial tough start, Weber against all odds took Blaze to the play-off final beating favourites Sheffield Steelers 4–2. Weber subsequently signed for a further season and again reached the final of the playoffs however this time Blaze lost 2–0 to Nottingham Panthers. 

Weber&#x27;s departure was announced soon after, and was swiftly replaced by ex-player Danny Stewart who returned to the club from the Fife Flyers ahead of the 2016–17 season. Stewart moved on to the Nottingham Panthers in 2024.

<text>The Welland River (originally called the Chippawa Creek) is a river in the Golden Horseshoe that passes through the Southern Ontario cities of Welland and Niagara Falls. It flows from its source, a Drainage Basin just south of Hamilton, Ontario to meet the Niagara River.

==History==

The river was originally called the Chippawa Creek since it drained into the Niagara River at Chippawa. Like many other places in Niagara, it was renamed by John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada in 1792. The present name was taken from the river of the same name in Lincolnshire, Eastern England. The Welland River is occasionally referred to as Chippawa Creek, especially by those in the Chippawa area itself.

The Welland Canal was named after the river since it originally was planned to link Lake Ontario to Welland River. The city of Welland was later named after both waterways which crossed in the city.

===O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Bridge===

The oldest structure spanning the Welland River was O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Bridge, which was built in and crossed the river between the townships of Pelham and Wainfleet. The settler, Patrick O&#x27;Reilly, son of Sgt. John Reilly, of Stamford Township (present-day Niagara Falls), settled in Wainfleet in 1806. After meeting Sarah, the daughter of John Brown of Pelham Township, Patrick O&#x27;Reilly felled a couple of very tall trees across the River to shorten his journey to see her. A better bridge was built after they married and Patrick realized Sarah was frightened of walking along the logs. John Brown O&#x27;Reilly was their son who acted as Clerk of Wainfleet Township for many years. Over the years O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Bridge saw many upgrades and improvements until it finally became the responsibility of the municipality. That is about the time O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Bridge became a single-lane iron truss bridge, the only of its kind on the entire river, and one of the oldest iron truss bridges in Southern Ontario. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Bridge was demolished in and was replaced with a more modern, wider span.

==Geography==

The river flows under two navigable aqueducts: the Welland Recreational Waterway and the new alignment of the Welland Canal. An important tributary of the river is Coyle Creek, a picturesque and thickly forested creek that flows into the river on the north bank.

A stream of the river branches off shortly before its mouth. This canal quickly turns an open-cut hydropower channel through the city of Niagara Falls on its way to the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations in Queenston. It drains an area of .

The International Control Dam, a weir in the Niagara River, causes the Welland River to reverse its direction twice a day when the flow of water over the Niagara Falls is reduced overnight and the water heads back up the river as far back as Wellandport. When the water flow is restored, the water direction of the Welland River changes once again to flow towards the Niagara River.

<text>Na příkopě (literally &quot;On the moat&quot;), informally also &quot;Na Příkopě&quot;, &quot;Na Příkopech&quot; or &quot;Příkopy&quot;, is a street in the center of Prague, Czech Republic, connecting Wenceslas Square with the Republic Square.

It separates the Old Town from the New Town. It is a place of representative buildings including the headquarters of the Czech National Bank, old palaces and luxurious shops.

Na příkopě is the most expensive street among the all states of the V4. In 2019, with the amount of rent 2,820 euros (72,478 CZK) per square meter per year, ranked on 18th place among the most expensive shopping streets in the world.

==History==

Na Příkopě street leads on the site of former 10-meter-wide and 8-meter-deep moat from 1234, which led along the medieval walls of the Old Town. Water flowed directly from the Vltava river and when the moat was filled, the Old Town formed a closed island. The moat was covered in 1760. After covering, chestnut trees were planted here and the street was named &quot;Ve starých alejích&quot; (&quot;In old alleys&quot;). In 1845-70 the street was named &quot;Kolowratská třída&quot; and since 1871 bears the name &quot;Na Příkopě&quot;.

Because it was one of the few very wide streets in Prague, it soon became a traffic artery. Since 1875, the first line of the Prague horse-drawn tram has been lead here, which has been electrified since 1899. In 1919, Můstek became the first intersection in Prague to be controlled by a traffic policeman. In 1927, then the second intersection with the light signaling (the first being Hybernská-Dlážděná-Havlíčkova intersection).

In the 1960s, traffic jams were getting worse. However, in 1978 the metro station was opened at Můstek, and Line B followed the street since 1985 for almost its entire length to the Republic Square. Nearly century-old tram line was canceled in 1985 and the bustling urban street turned into a pedestrian zone. On the street appeared many new stores and it became an important business center of Prague promenade.

<doc id="1201011" wikidata="Q3290825" url="?curid=1201011" title="Churchwarden">
<text>A churchwarden is a lay official in a parish or congregation of the Anglican Communion or Catholic Church, usually working as a part-time volunteer. In the Anglican tradition, holders of these positions are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the parish board, usually called a vestry, parochial church council, or in the case of a Cathedral parish the chapter. Historically, a churchwarden was responsible for maintaining the churchwardens&#x27; accounts of the parish&#x27;s income and expenses.

== Responsibilities of office ==
Churchwardens have a duty to represent the laity and co-operate with the incumbent (or, in cases of vacancy, the bishop). They are expected to lead the parishioners by setting a good example and encouraging unity and peace. They have a duty to maintain order and peace in the church and churchyard at all times, and especially during services, although this task tends to be devolved to sidesmen.

Churchwardens in many parts of the Anglican Communion are legally responsible for all the property and movable goods belonging to a parish church. If so, they have a duty under ecclesiastical law to keep an up-to-date inventory of the valuables, and if applicable a &quot;terrier of the property&quot; (a listing and/or map of the church&#x27;s lands, known as glebe, some of which may be let). Whenever churchwardens authorise work on the church building having obtained a faculty or to carry out work recommended in the church&#x27;s Quinquennial Inspection Report, they must record this in the Church Logbook; it is inspected with the inventory. The churchwardens must ensure these logs are ready for inspection in case of a visitation and for periodic inspections. Churchwardens were also historically responsible for churchwardens&#x27; accounts, which detailed the expenses and income of parishes.

Priests and their equivalent tend to devolve day-to-day maintenance of church buildings and contents to their churchwardens.

If an incumbency is vacant, the bishop (or the Archdeacon acting on his behalf) will usually appoint the churchwardens as sequestrators of the parish until the bishop appoints a new incumbent. The sequestrators ensure that a minimum number of church services continue to be held in the parish, and in particular that the Eucharist continues to be celebrated every Sunday and on every Principal Feast. This duty is usually discharged by organising a regular rota of a few volunteer clergy from amongst either Non-Stipendiary Ministers from within that diocese or in some cases retired clergy living in or near the parish. The bishop will tend to consult the churchwardens before appointing a new priest to take over the parish; in England there is a set process to follow which also involves representatives of the congregation.

Churchwardens&#x27; duties may vary with the customs of the parish or congregation, the canons of the diocese to which the parish belongs, the desires of the priest, and the direction of the parish board or the congregation as a whole. A definition of their duties is that they are &quot;ultimately responsible for almost everything in a church which does not have to be done by a priest. If the churchwarden does not do it himself, then he is responsible for making sure that it is done by someone&quot;.

=== Powers ===
In England, churchwardens have specific powers to enable them to keep the peace in churchyards.

The following are punishable with a £200 fine:

* riotous, violent, or indecent behaviour in any cathedral church, parish or district church or chapel of the Church of England or in any churchyard or burial ground (whether during a service or at any other time)
* molesting, disturbing, vexing, or troubling, or by any other unlawful means disquieting or misusing:
** any preacher duly authorised to preach therein, or
** any clergyman in holy orders ministering or celebrating any sacrament, or any divine service, rite, or office, in any cathedral, church, or chapel, or in any churchyard or burial ground.

The churchwarden of the parish or place where the offence was committed may apprehend a person committing such an offence, and take them before a magistrates&#x27; court. In practice this means they should be aware of these offences and may be expected to conduct a citizen&#x27;s arrest until police arrive, if appropriate. Until 2003, the offence was punishable by up to two months&#x27; imprisonment. However, caution is advised in the use of this power.

== Types of churchwarden ==
Historically, there are two main types of warden: the people&#x27;s warden(s) (and assistants, if any) are elected annually by the congregation as a whole (at what is called the Annual Vestry Meeting or &quot;meeting of the parishioners&quot;); the rector&#x27;s warden(s) (and assistants, if any), are appointed by the incumbent. However, this distinction has been abolished in several areas of the Anglican Communion in favour of both wardens being appointed jointly (notably in England, although the incumbent retains the right in some circumstances to appoint one warden).

In some jurisdictions (but not in England) where a parish temporarily has no priest, is not self-supporting, or in which the parish board has been dissolved, wardens are appointed directly by the bishop and are called &quot;bishop&#x27;s wardens&quot;.

The only areas in which wardens almost always have no authority, often proscribed by canon, are music and liturgy, which are considered to be under the exclusive authority of the priest or bishop in charge of the parish. Nevertheless, in England churchwardens have authority to officiate at Morning and Evening Prayer if a priest or licensed lay person is unavailable.

== Churchwardens by country ==
=== Church of England ===

In the Church of England, churchwardens are officers of the parish and officers of the bishop. Each parish elects two churchwardens annually (unless an existing custom in place on 1 January 2002, and which has continued since before 1 January 1925, states otherwise) and they are elected on or before 31 May and are sworn in between being elected and 31 August the same year. Churchwardens are (re-)elected annually at the Meeting of Parishioners and can serve a maximum of six years followed by a two-year break unless the rule is previously suspended by the Meeting of Parishioners.

A few Anglican churches, for historical reasons outlined above, have three churchwardens instead of the usual two; two such examples are All Saints, West Ham and St Margaret&#x27;s, Barking. Historically, there are also a few churches which retain four churchwardens with St. Mary&#x27;s, Ecclesfield, Sheffield, as an example.

Some churches may appoint Assistant Churchwardens to help them. These are distinct from Deputy Churchwardens who have a precise role in certain limited cases. The terms &quot;Honorary Churchwarden&quot; or &quot;Churchwarden Emeritus&quot; are sometimes bestowed on retiring churchwardens; these are purely honorary terms and do not allow such a holder to continue to sit unelected on the PCC.

=== Church of Ireland ===
One Church Warden is appointed by the incumbent, whilst another is elected by the Easter General Vestry. Both serve for one year terms, during which they are ex officio members of the select vestry. As well as performing some logistical functions normally associated with a sexton or verger, church wardens have certain constitutional rights and responsibilities: they may convene and chair meetings of the General Vestry or Select Vestry (but only under certain circumstances), and their consent is required for the use of any experimental forms of service and for any visiting ministers who are not in full communion with the Church of Ireland. Church Wardens are also responsible for overseeing the collection during the Offertory, for the presentation of the bread and wine to the officiating priest during Holy Communion, and for the safe custody of church plate.

=== Episcopal Church in the USA ===
The canons of some US dioceses permit or mandate the election of all wardens, in which case they are usually referred to as the &quot;senior warden&quot; and the &quot;junior warden&quot;. Sometimes, however, the senior warden is known as the &quot;rector&#x27;s warden&quot; and the junior warden, the &quot;people&#x27;s warden&quot;. In some of the latter cases, the rector&#x27;s warden is chosen by the rector, while the people&#x27;s warden is elected by the congregation. Wardens serve for a fixed term, normally one to two years, and are usually automatically members of the parish canonical committee, commonly called the &quot;vestry&quot;, and sometimes automatically delegates to the diocesan synod, or convention, as well.

=== Anglican Church of Southern Africa ===
The duties of churchwardens in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa (ACSA) are detailed in Canon 29 of the Canons and Constitution of the ACSA, as follows.

Churchwardens are the officers of the Bishop and the principal representatives of the congregations. Together with the Incumbent they constitute the executive of the Parish Council and have special responsibility in the following matters:

* to ensure that a register is kept of all parishioners;
* to keep an inventory of all goods, ornaments and furniture belonging to the church, to provide for the safety and preservation of the registers and to deliver the same to their successors on ceasing to hold office;
* to execute the policy of the Parish Council relating to property and parochial finance;
* to be responsible for the preparation of annual estimates of revenue and expenditure and the presentation of accounts to the Vestry;
* to see to the seating of the congregation, without respect of persons;
* to aid the Incumbent with information and counsel in all matters relating to the Parish, and particularly in cases contemplated in the rubrics before the service of Holy Communion.
* to complain to the Bishop or Archdeacon if there should be anything plainly amiss or reprehensible in the life or doctrine of the Incumbent and also if there be anything contrary to order or decorum in the administration of Divine Service.

Additional duties and responsibilities may also be specified in the various dioceses of the Province.

<doc id="1201012" wikidata="Q15262256" url="?curid=1201012" title="Ngaruroro River">
<text>The Ngaruroro River is located in the eastern North Island of New Zealand. It runs for a total of 164 kilometres southeast from the Kaweka Range, Kaimanawa Range and Ruahine Range and then east before emptying into Hawke Bay roughly halfway between the cities of Napier and Hastings, near the town of Clive (drainage area above Tutaekuri River confluence). About 40% of the catchment is pasture, and 55% native forest.
The meaning of Ngaruroro is obscure.

==Course==
The upper Ngaruroro drains the Kaweka Forest Park and it is used for trout fishing (mostly rainbow), rafting, tramping and deer hunting.

The river is mostly a single-thread channel down to Whanawhana ( from the coast), flowing through a greywacke rock gorge. Below Whanawhana, the river opens to wide braided channel and is joined by the Maraekakaho River. The Ngaruroro shares a river mouth with the Tutaekuri, Clive River and Muddy Creek. The meeting of these rivers forms the Waitangi Estuary.

===Aquifer===
The Ngaruroro River recharges freshwater to the Heretaunga groundwater aquifer (in the order of ). This aquifer feeds several streams in the area (e.g. Raupare, Irongate), in addition to pumping that supports extensive orchards of the Heretaunga Plains. Eventually the aquifer discharges to the sea in submarine springs some off the coast.

==Flooding==
The Ngaruroro is one of several rivers that helped form the alluvial Heretaunga Plains at the south end of the coast of Hawke Bay. The course of the Ngaruroro has changed several times, originally flowing down what is now the Clive River. It changed to much of its present course in 1867 during a major flood. In 1969, the bottom of river was diverted more directly to the coast (near Pakowhai Road) in an effort to reduce flooding. The river is now contained within flood banks in these lower reaches from Fernhill, Hawke&#x27;s Bay to the mouth of the river. The Karamu and Clive remain as rivers, but drain a smaller catchment.

The river breached its flood banks during Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023, inundating a large area of the Heretaunga Plains. The settlements of Omahu, Waiohiki and Pakowhai were severely affected with dozens of homes being destroyed. Large areas of orchards and vineyards were ruined and homes in Taradale were evacuated. Bridges 216 and 217 (Waitangi Washout) on the Palmerston North–Gisborne railway line and Waitangi Park Bridge on SH51 were damaged.

<doc id="1201014" wikidata="Q9010016" url="?curid=1201014" title="Issy Smith">
<text>Issy Smith (18 September 1890 – 10 September 1940) was a British-Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to eligible forces of the Commonwealth and United Kingdom. In recognition of his VC, he was also awarded the French and Russian Cross of St. George (4th class) by the respective governments.

Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (and other renderings), to parents residing in Turkey, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and enlisted in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after he had transferred to the reserve, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, Smith was engaged in the Second Battle of Ypres. On 26 April 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them &quot;with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk&quot;. His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.

After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in Melbourne&#x27;s Jewish community, was appointed a Justice of the Peace, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the United Australia Party in the 1931 general election.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Constantinople, the son of Moses (1822-1907) and Eva Shmeilowitz (1845-1934), who were of Russian Empire Jewish origin. They met in Berdychiv and later relocated to Odessa. They left Rostov-on-Don in 1888 for Turkey. They relocated to Egypt at the start of the 1900s. Although it was alleged his father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk in Egypt, &#x27;this has to be completely false. Moses would have been nearly 80 years of age by the time he took the job - and he spoke no French&#x27; Eva worked as a seamstress, and Moses worked a sewing machine. It is not clear what other work he obtained.

Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London, where his elder brothers had migrated to. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, London, and worked as a deliverer in the East End, then an impoverished ghetto where Yiddish was the predominant spoken language. Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith&#x27;s arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked but was curtailed by the enactment of the Aliens Act in 1905.

It was theorised that the pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted, in the process of enlisting, at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. This legend has been dismissed as apocryphal, as this surname was already used by his brothers Jacob and Joseph and Morris who lived in London. He joined the militia on 21 April 1904, giving a declared age of 17 years, 8 months. He was working as a plumber, living in Manchester. He enlisted under regular terms of service in the British Army on 2 September 1904, giving a declared age of 18 years, joining as a Private in the Manchester Regiment. Smith completed his training, later serving in South Africa and India with the 1st Battalion. At the time of the 1911 census, he was stationed at Kamptee Cantonment in the Nagpur division within India. He boxed competitively. He was the middleweight champion of his battalion. He entered the 1911 Delhi Durbar boxing competition, but was eliminated in the second round on points. A tailor&#x27;s copy of the Delhi Durbar Medal (1911) was among his mounted medals.

He was discharged to the army reserve in 1912, after eight years of service with the colours. A newspaper article states that upon returning to London from India, he was greeted at the railway station by his brother, accompanied by Elsie, who would later become his wife. (Elsie&#x27;s sister would marry Alfred Burley, a colleague of Issy in the same battalion.) Smith emigrated to Australia, after brief employment in London, in April 1914. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of Ascot Vale while working for the city&#x27;s gas company.

==World War I==
Given that he was retained as a reservist until 1 September 1916, for the remainder of his 12 year engagement, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some contemporary newspaper articles sources state that Smith was present at the capture of German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force. This is unlikely as there is nothing stated within official documentation to support this claim.

He reported for duty at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, headquarters (3rd Military District), on 10 August, and embarked SS Miltiades on 21 October 1914. He arrived in Britain, and was posted to the regimental depot in December 1914. He was duly posted to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion on 6 January 1915. The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was at Cleethorpes. The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was a pool of trained men, from which reinforcements were sent to the Western Front. On 23 February 1915 he disembarked in France. After spending time at Rouen, he was posted to the front on 9 March 1915.

Having actively engaged in the battles of Givenchy and Neuve Chapelle, the 1st Manchesters had already incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of &quot;Second Ypres&quot; on 22 April 1915. Chemical warfare first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on 26 April 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other Allied units. Rudimentary forms of protection against the chlorine gas proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.

During the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in &quot;many more wounded men&quot; throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions &quot;regardless of personal risk&quot;. Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: &quot;He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did&quot;.
Smith was gassed in April and May 1915. In June, he was being treated at No. 6 Stationary Hospital at Le Havre. Smith&#x27;s service record suggests that he was medically evacuated from France in August 1915. Smith was hospitalised in Dublin, Ireland, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at Buckingham Palace by King George V. He was feted by publications such as &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, and his status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment. His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process. On one such occasion, in September 1915, he was invited back to his old school in the East End to receive a gold watch and chain in honour of his Victoria Cross. Also that month, Smith was received at Mansion House, Dublin, by the Under-Secretary for Ireland, Matthew Nathan, who took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland. Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds. While documenting his recruitment drive, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of Yorkshire because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintance. Smith&#x27;s tour continued otherwise without disruption, taking him to Edinburgh, Scotland. His appointed rank changed from Acting Lance Corporal to unpaid Acting Lance Sergeant on 5 October 1915, then he was promoted to Sergeant on 7 March 1916. His partial recovery from gassing meant that, for accounting purposes, he was taken on the strength of the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion from 15 December 1915, as opposed to the Depot, which was associated with hospitalised men. It was during 1916 that he participated in charity boxing matches.

Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final European battle at Loos. With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on 10 December 1915 and arriving in Basra on 8 January 1916 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. 

Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant. He was posted to the 1st Battalion on 4 September 1916, serving in Mesopotamia. Within a fortnight of arriving at Basra, he was hospitalised with malaria. After the capture of Baghdad on 11 March 1917, Smith&#x27;s nose was broken by a shell during the subsequent fighting. He transferred to the Royal Engineers on 1 April 1917. He was granted leave, which he took in Egypt in May 1917, and is understood to have seen his family. He was hospitalised on 5 August 1917, accidentally receiving a large cut to his right knee whilst on duty. A letter sent by Smith in 1940 gave an outline of his service history. He took part in the fall of Baghdad, was transferred to the IWT branch of the Royal Engineers, and was redeployed to Palestine. In January 1918, he was treated at Port Said for emphysema. He was hospitalised at the start of September, and was discharged on 19 September 1918.&#x27; He was discharged from hospital on 21 November 1918, and returned to Cairo. He had been wounded five times, according to the Australian Dictionary of Biographies. A contemporary newspaper article states it was four times. The family are in possession of the four wound stripes that he wore on his uniform, which can be seen on his wedding photo. Smith embarked at Port Said on 17 January 1919. Upon returning to Britain in February 1919, he got married, and was discharged from the army on 30 April 1919.

Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions. In June 1920, he attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace, given by the king for all surviving Victoria Cross recipients. They included veterans of the Indian Mutiny, Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Relief of General Gordon, the First and Second Boer Wars, countless campaigns on the borders of the empire, and dozens from the Great War. In October 1921, with Harry Kenny, he unveiled the Hackney War Memorial. In 1922, he attended &quot;The Pilgrimage to Ypres&quot;, in Belgium, laying a wreath at the Cloth Hall there.

==Legacy==

Despite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for £20, only for them to be recovered by the Jewish Historical Society on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith&#x27;s varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He had married his wife Elsie (née McKechnie) at Camberwell Register Office, followed by a formal ceremony held at Central Synagogue, Hallam Street, as an observance of Jewish religious tradition. Whether there was disapproval by the family, this is not known. The family relocated from Camberwell to Hackney later that year. The marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice, born 1919 and 1932 (died 2020) respectively). He emigrated to Australia in 1927.

The family settled in Moonee Ponds, Melbourne, where Smith&#x27;s standing in the Jewish community became high. There he joined the Essendon sub branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). In 1928, he was appointed manager of British International Pictures in Melbourne, and then worked for Dunlop Rubber Company. His final job was with the Civil Aviation Board at Essendon Airport. Appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1930, Smith tried politics as a candidate in the 1931 federal election for the United Australia Party, contesting the seat of Melbourne in the House of Representatives, and &quot;seriously challenged the hitherto unassailable Dr Maloney&quot;.

On 20 February 1940, he sent a letter, to apply to join the Second Australian Imperial Force. A Major Barrett replied, to advise there were presently no suitable vacancies, but if he could provide the particulars of his army service and age, for future guidance, it would be appreciated. He sent a response to the Major, dated 4 March 1940, a copy of which is with the family. He stated that his date of birth was 18th September 1890.

Smith died of coronary thrombosis on 10 September 1940. He was buried in the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His medals were sold by his family in 1990, and auctioned 5 years later as part of a special collection of Medals to the Manchester Regiment, selling for £35,288 (US$75,000).

Following representations from the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced in September 2013 that the plan, to memorialise the 482 British-born First World War Victoria Cross medal holders by laying commemorative paving stones in their home towns, would be extended to the 145 born overseas include Smith. At the time of the announcement, it was believed he was born in Egypt. He is commemorated in Rope Walk Gardens, a few minutes walk away from the location of Berners Street School in Whitechapel.

<text>The State of Vietnam (; Chữ Hán: 國家越南; ) was a state in Southeast Asia that existed from 1949 until 1955, first as a member of the French Union and later as a country (from 4 June 1954 to 26 October 1955). The state claimed authority over all of Vietnam during the First Indochina War, although large parts of its territory were controlled by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. 

The state was created in 1949 by France as part of the French Union and was internationally recognised in 1950. Former Emperor Bảo Đại became Chief of State. After the 1954 Geneva Agreements, the State of Vietnam abandoned its sovereignty over the northern part of the country, which was controlled by the Việt Minh. Ngô Đình Diệm was appointed prime minister the same year and—after having ousted Bảo Đại in 1955—became president of the Republic of Vietnam.

==History==
===Unification of Vietnam (1947–48)===
Since the August Revolution, the Việt Minh had seized all of the territories of Vietnam. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam was established by the Việt Minh on September 2, 1945 (the same day Japan signed surrender documents with the United States).

By February 1947, following the pacification of Tonkin (Northern Vietnam), the Tonkinese capital, Hanoi, and the main traffic axis returned to French control. The Việt Minh partisans were forced to retreat into the jungle and prepared to pursue the war using guerrilla warfare.

In order to reduce Việt Minh leader Hồ Chí Minh’s influence over the Vietnamese population, the French authorities in Indochina supported the return to power of Bảo Đại (the last emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty), by establishing puppet states, including the State of Vietnam. Bao Dai had voluntarily abdicated on August 25, 1945, after the fall of the short-lived Empire of Vietnam, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan.

On June 5, 1948, the Halong Bay Agreements (&quot;Accords de la baie d’Along&quot;) allowed the creation of a unified Vietnamese government replacing the governments of Tonkin (North Vietnam) and Annam (Middle Vietnam) associated to France within the French Union and the Indochinese Federation then including the neighboring Kingdom of Laos and Kingdom of Cambodia. Cochinchina (South Vietnam), however, had a different status, both as a colony and as an autonomous republic, and its reunification with the rest of Vietnam had to be approved by its local assembly, and then by the French National Assembly. During the transitional period, a Provisional Central Government of Vietnam was proclaimed: Nguyễn Văn Xuân, until then head of the &quot;Provisional Government of South Vietnam&quot; (as Cochinchina had been known since 1947) became its president, while Bảo Đại waited for a complete reunification to take office.

However, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had declared the independence of Vietnam and had control of almost all of Vietnam&#x27;s territory since September 2, 1945. Besides that, the DRV had also hosted the 1946 Vietnamese National Assembly election with the participation of 89% of Vietnamese voters (north and south). The Democratic Republic of Vietnam had officially become the constitutional representatives of Vietnam in 1946.

Since the Halong Bay Agreements resulted in many aspects—excluding the referendum—in the enforcement of the March 6, 1946, Indochinese Independence Convention signed by Communist Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Vietnam and High Commissioner of France in Indochina Admiral Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu, representative of Félix Gouin&#x27;s Provisional French Republic led by the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO), some regarded the State of Vietnam as a puppet state of the French Fourth Republic.

===French Union (1949–54)===

On May 20, 1949, the French National Assembly approved the reunification of Cochinchina with the rest of Vietnam. The decision took effect on June 4 and the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed on July 2. From 1949 to 1954, after reunification with Cochinchina, the State of Vietnam had partial autonomy from France as an associated state within the French Union.

Bảo Đại fought against communist leader Hồ Chí Minh for legitimacy as the legitimate government of Vietnam through the struggle between the Vietnamese National Army and the Việt Minh during the First Indochina War.

The State of Vietnam found support in the French Fourth Republic and the United States (1950–1954) while Hồ Chí Minh was backed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (since 1950), and to a lesser extent by the Soviet Union. Despite French support, roughly 60% of Vietnamese territory was under Việt Minh control in 1952.

===Partition (1954–55)===

After the Geneva Conference of 1954, as well as becoming fully independent with its departure from the French Union, the State of Vietnam became territorially confined to those lands of Vietnam south of the 17th parallel, and as such became commonly known as Republic of Vietnam. Communist forces entered Hanoi on 10 October 1954. 
The massive semi-voluntary migration of anti-communist north Vietnamese, essentially Roman Catholic people, proceeded during the French-American Operation Passage to Freedom from 1954 to 1955.
==Politics==
===Provisional Central Government of Vietnam (1948–49)===
On May 27, 1948, Nguyễn Văn Xuân, then President of the Republic of Cochinchina, became President of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam (&quot;Thủ tướng lâm thời&quot;) following the merging of the government of Cochin China and Vietnam in what is sometimes referred as &quot;Pre-Vietnam&quot;.

===State of Vietnam (1949–55)===
On June 14, 1949, Bảo Đại was appointed Chief of State (&quot;Quốc trưởng&quot;) of the State of Vietnam; he was concurrently Prime Minister for a short while (&quot;Kiêm nhiệm Thủ tướng&quot;).

On October 26, 1955, the Republic of Vietnam was established and Ngô Đình Diệm became the first President of the Republic.

===Leaders (1948–55)===

===1955 referendum, Republic of Vietnam===
In South Vietnam, a referendum was scheduled for 23 October 1955 to determine the future direction of the south, in which the people would choose Diệm or Bảo Đại as the leader of South Vietnam. During the election, Diệm&#x27;s brother Ngô Đình Nhu and the Personalist Labor Revolutionary Party (commonly known as &quot;Cần Lao Party&quot;) supplied Diệm&#x27;s electoral base in organizing and supervising the elections, especially the propaganda campaign for destroying Bảo Đại&#x27;s reputation. Supporters of Bảo Đại were not allowed to campaign, and were physically attacked by Nhu&#x27;s workers. Official results showed 98.2 per cent of voters favoured Diệm, an implausibly high result that was condemned as fraudulent. The total number of votes far exceeded the number of registered voters by over 380,000, further evidence that the referendum was heavily rigged. For example, only 450,000 voters were registered in Saigon, but 605,025 were said to have voted for Diệm. On 26 October, Diệm proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam—widely known as South Vietnam—whose reformed army, with American assistance, pursued the conflict with North Vietnam; the Viet Cong replaced the Viet Minh, in the Vietnam War.

==Military==

===Vietnamese National Army (1949–55)===

Following the signing of the 1949 Élysée Accords in Paris, Bảo Đại was able to create a National Army for defense purposes.

It fought under the State of Vietnam&#x27;s banner and leadership and was commanded by General Nguyễn Văn Hinh.

== Economy ==

=== Currency ===

The currency used within the French Union was the French Indochinese piastre. Notes were issued and managed by the &quot;Issue Institute of the States of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam&quot; (&quot;Institut d’Emission des Etats du Cambodge, du Laos et du Viêt-Nam&quot;).

== Administrative divisions ==

=== Autonomous regions === 

Following the creation of the State of Vietnam and the establishment of its government, the Chief of State Bảo Đại signed the two ordinances related to the administration and local governance of the State of Vietnam, namely Ordinance No. 1 (&quot;Organisation and Operation of civil authorities in Vietnam&quot;) and Ordinance No. 2 (&quot;Statutes of Government office&quot;). These ordinances divided the State of Vietnam into three large autonomous regions, namely Bắc Việt (former Tonkin), Trung Việt (former Annam), and Nam Việt (former Cochinchina), the local government of each autonomous region was headed by a &quot;Thủ hiến&quot; (Governour).

On 4 August 1954 the government of the State of Vietnam enacted Ordinance No. 21 which abolished the autonomous status of the three regions and abolished the post of regional governour, replacing them with central government representatives in all parts of its territory. The three regions were renamed to Bắc phần, Trung phần, and Nam phần.

=== Domain of the Crown ===

The &quot;Domain of the Crown&quot; (; French: &quot;Domaine de la Couronne&quot;) was originally the Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s geopolitical concept for its protectorates and principalities where the Kinh ethnic group didn&#x27;t make up the majority, later it became a type of administrative unit of the State of Vietnam. It was officially established on 15 April 1950 and dissolved on 11 March 1955. In the areas of the Domain of the Crown Chief of State Bảo Đại was still officially (and legally) titled as the &quot;Emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty&quot;.

The Domain of the Crown contained the following five provinces established from the former Montagnard country of South Indochina:

# Đồng Nai Thượng
# Lâm Viên
# Pleiku
# Darlac
# Kontum

In Bắc phần it contained the following provinces:

# Hòa Bình (Mường Autonomous Territory)
# Phong Thổ (Thái Autonomous Territory)
# Lai Châu (Thái Autonomous Territory)
# Sơn La (Thái Autonomous Territory)
# Lào Kay (Mèo Autonomous Territory)
# Hà Giang (Mèo Autonomous Territory)
# Bắc Kạn (Thổ Autonomous Territory)
# Cao Bằng (Thổ Autonomous Territory)
# Lạng Sơn (Thổ Autonomous Territory)
# Hải Ninh (Nùng Autonomous Territory)
# Móng Cái (Nùng Autonomous Territory)

<text>Icons is an American documentary TV show that aired on G4 from May 1, 2002, to March 4, 2007. It originally focused on significant people, companies, products, history, and milestones in the world of video games.

On May 10, 2006, it was announced that &quot;Icons&quot; was relaunching on June 3 with an episode focusing on J. J. Abrams. The relaunch was an attempt to feature a broader scope on things and people that &quot;men 18–34 care about, admire and emulate.&quot; Recent episodes about George A. Romero, Frank Miller and the history of the &quot;King Kong&quot; franchise had aired prior to the announcement. The final season focused on pop culture subjects such as Marc Ecko, &quot;The Onion&quot;, and &quot;Family Guy&quot;. The classic video game themed episodes continued to air on the network sporadically until 2009, under the new name of &quot;Game Makers&quot;, unrelated to the G4 series of the same name.

==Episodes==

<text>The Latvian ruble () was the name of two currencies of Latvia: the Latvian ruble, in use from 1919 to 1922, and the second Latvian ruble, in use from 1992 to 1993.

==First Latvian ruble (no currency code)==

After the proclamation of the Republic of Latvia in 1918, a great variety of different currencies were in circulation: ostrubels, ostmarks, papiermarks, the so-called &quot;Tsar rubles&quot;, the so-called &quot;Duma Money&quot;, as well as promissory notes issued by several town municipalities.

On 4 February 1919, the Latvian Provisional Government authorized the Minister of Finance to issue the first currency notes of the Republic of Latvia: Treasury notes. They were denominated in rubles (Latvian: &quot;rublis&quot;, plural: &quot;rubļi&quot; or &quot;rubłı&quot;) and kopecks (Latvian: &quot;kapeika&quot;, plural nominative: &quot;kapeikas&quot;, plural genitive: &quot;kapeiku&quot;). On 27 March 1919 the exchange rates for the Latvian ruble were fixed at 1 ostmark, 2 papiermarks and 1.5 imperial rubles. Between April 1919 and September 1922, currency notes were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 kopecks and 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 500 rubles. No coins were issued.

The first state currency notes were printed in 1919 by Andrievs Niedra&#x27;s government, which was considered pro-German and illegal, and was overthrown in the same year. The legal government of Kārlis Ulmanis printed quite similar notes but with different signatures on them. This government recognized the previously printed banknotes as legal tender. The designer of these banknotes was Jūlijs Madernieks. Latvian rouble banknotes were also issued by municipalities of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic from 1919 to 1920.

On 3 August 1922, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the &quot;Regulations on Money&quot; which introduced the &quot;lats&quot; as Latvia&#x27;s national currency, with one lats equalling 50 rubles. The ruble remained in circulation alongside the lats for a time.

==Second Latvian ruble (LVR)==
Latvia&#x27;s regained independence was recognized by the Soviet Union on 6 September 1991. In the first four months of 1992, the country was adversely affected by inflation of the Soviet ruble. Immediate return of the lats was not an option, since it would be devalued very quickly.

To resolve the problem, on 4 May 1992, the Monetary Reform Commission of the Republic of Latvia passed a resolution &quot;On Introduction of the Latvian ruble&quot;. From 7 May 1992, a temporary currency, the Latvian ruble (LVR), was put into circulation as a legal tender parallel to the existing ruble notes. It was declared equal in value to the Soviet ruble. Latvian ruble notes (widely known as &quot;repšiki&quot;, after the then governor of the Central Bank, Einars Repše) were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 200, and 500 rubles.

==Lats==
The second Latvian ruble was withdrawn from circulation on 18 October 1993, but could be exchanged for lats until 1 July 1994, when it lost validity. and the historic national currency - the &quot;lats&quot; - was reintroduced in 1993, replacing the Latvian ruble at the ratio of 1 lats (LVL) = 200 rubles (LVR). On 1 January, 2014, lats was replaced by the euro at the rate of 0.702804 lats to 1 euro.

<text>Carrie is an online digital library project based at the University of Kansas containing full-text books and documents. The site became operational in 1993, and has the distinction of being among the first university-library hosted sites for full on-line texts. The site, named after the university&#x27;s first professional librarian, evolved from an earlier collection of online resources. This evolution was spearheaded by Lynn Nelson, a professor of history, and put into effect by a team creating the Lynx text-based browser. In 1993, the site linked to over three thousand texts. It currently has extensive links to historical documents relating to Kansas history, as well as significant links to material in other areas.

<doc id="1201054" wikidata="Q5309406" url="?curid=1201054" title="Drury convention">
<text>The Drury convention is a bridge convention, used to show a game-invitational major suit raise by a passed hand while guarding against a light opening by partner in third or fourth seat. It is initiated by an artificial and forcing 2 response by the passed hand to a 1 or 1 opening by partner. The 2 bid shows at least three-card support for opener&#x27;s suit with 10-12 support points and asks opener to clarify the strength of their opening hand. The convention is also known in Europe as &quot;Toronto&quot;.

==Origins and purpose==
The convention was developed by Canadian Douglas Drury (1914–1967) and his then playing partner Eric Murray (1928–2018) to manage Murray&#x27;s propensity to open light in third seat. Opening light (i.e. with marginally less than normal values) in the third seat is a common and effective bidding tactic because the player in the fourth seat may well have the best hand at the table and be poised to open the bidding given the opportunity. A third seat light opening, especially in a major suit, will act preemptively to make it harder for that player to enter the bidding. However, it creates two problems:
# a simple change of suit is no longer a forcing bid, and
# responding partner, already a passed hand, is unsure if his opening partner has a normal or light opening, and any jump response could get the partnership too high.

The traditional way to show good support for opener&#x27;s suit is to jump to the three-level (e.g. 1 – 3). But if partner has opened light, this may result in an overly ambitious contract, despite the good support. Drury allows responding partner to learn if his opening partner has opened with a normal opening hand or has a light opening hand. If it is a light hand, or even a minimum normal opening hand, the contract can be set at the two-level, whereas non-Drury partnerships, with the same hands, would have to sign off at greater risk at the three-level. Owing to its role in the competitive bidding of part-score contracts, Drury is advantageous primarily in match point scoring events.

==Opener&#x27;s rebid==
===Original Drury convention===
The convention was first published in &quot;The Bridge World&quot; in January 1957. Murray&#x27;s presentation of the original convention included the following features:
# The Drury 2 is an artificial one-round force by a passed hand responding to partner&#x27;s third or fourth-hand major suit opening bid
# With a normal opening bid, opener rebids normally but with a light opening hand, he negatives with 2
# With a distributional hand containing length in opener&#x27;s major but with fewer than 9 HCP, responder preempts by jumping to the 3-level in opener&#x27;s suit

===Reverse Drury===
A rebid of 2 shows a full opening. While not universally accepted, a bid of 2 by opener after opening 1 is also a weakish bid showing five spades and four hearts (or better). With a good hand (say 15 or more points) opener may simply jump to game (four of the major suit). Other bids tend to be natural and descriptive, in effect a game try. With an excellent hand, opener may be interested in a slam and will bid accordingly.

==Responses by the Drury bidder==
In the sequence 1M-2; 2, opener has confirmed a full opening hand and the following rebids by the Drury bidder enables opener to judge the best final contract:
*2 - I have a minimum Drury hand
*2 - I have a maximum Drury hand but only three trumps
*2NT - I have a maximum Drury hand with four trumps

==Two-way Drury==
In this variant, the passed hand with 10+ points responds 2 to show exactly three-card support and 2 to show four-card support or better. This may help opener evaluate the probability of a successful game contract.

==Real club (or diamond) suit==
If the passed hand has 10+ points and a real club suit (or a diamond suit, when playing two-way Drury), this cannot be shown naturally at the two-level. One possibility is that a jump to 3 (or 3) shows this hand. An alternative is to use the forcing notrump. A third possibility (and the one recommended when the convention was introduced) is to bid 2, then rebid three of the minor. If this last approach is used, opener must be careful about jumping in own suit without extra length.

==Variation for four-card major systems==
The above examples are suitable for use with five-card major systems such as Standard American. Variations are required for use with four-card major systems such as Acol.

<doc id="1201055" wikidata="Q7974589" url="?curid=1201055" title="Watery, Domestic">
<text>Watery, Domestic is the fourth EP by American indie rock band Pavement, released on November 25, 1992 through Matador Records. It is the group&#x27;s final release to feature drummer Gary Young as a member.

== Background and recording==
The record marked the recording debuts of both Bob Nastanovich and Mark Ibold on percussion and bass respectively - although both had been touring members for some time, the debut album, &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; and the preceding EPs had been recorded by a trio of Stephen Malkmus, Spiral Stairs and Gary Young. 

All four songs can also be found on &quot;Slanted and Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe&quot;, the liner notes to which identify a further 3 songs as having been recorded during the same session. As well as the standard CD and 12&quot; vinyl releases, the record was also available as a 12&quot; picture disc in the UK.

== Artwork and packaging ==
The image of the rooster on the cover was created by defacing the cover of the self-titled album by Ambergris, with the photographic rooster image by Stephen S Myers, American, born 1942. The art direction for the original rooster image was provided by Thom Williams.

Bob Nastanovich revealed on the &quot;Discograffiti&quot; podcast that the EP&#x27;s title was a reference to Nastanovich&#x27;s beer preferences, since his tastes typically went towards low-alcohol American beer brands.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Texas Never Whispers&quot; was sampled by Placebo for their song &quot;Slave to the Wage&quot; from their 2000 album &quot;Black Market Music&quot;. It was also recorded by Deadsy for their debut demo in 1995.

&quot;Frontwards&quot; has been covered by both Cardiff-based indie-pop band Los Campesinos! and Hamilton Leithauser.

&quot;Shoot the Singer (1 Sick Verse)&quot; is often covered live by Yoni Wolf of the band Why?.

<text>The Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki ( ) is a museum in Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia, Greece. It holds and interprets artifacts from the Prehistoric, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods, mostly from the city of Thessaloniki but also from the region of Macedonia in general.

==The building and the exhibitions==
The museum is housed in a building designed by architect Patroklos Karantinos and is an example of the modern architectural trends of Greece. Built in 1962, the museum had a new wing added to it in 1980, in which the findings from Vergina were displayed, up until 1997. In 2001 and 2004, in the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics, the museum was extensively renovated and its permanent exhibits reorganized.
The central rooms hold exhibits from the archaeological excavations conducted in Thessaloniki and the broader area of Macedonia. The new wing hosts two exhibitions: &quot;The Gold of Macedon&quot;, with artefacts from the cemeteries of Sindos, Agia Paraskevi, Nea Filadelfia, Makrygialos, Derveni, Lete, Serres, and Evropos; and &quot;The Thessaloniki Area in Prehistory&quot;, with material from prehistoric settlements, dating from the Neolithic to the Early and Late Bronze Age.

At present, the collection of Archaic to Late Roman sculptures from Thessaloniki and Macedonia in general is displayed in the central section of the museum. They illustrate the history of Thessaloniki from prehistoric times to Late Antiquity. These rooms display architectural members from an Ionic temple of the 6th century BC, sculptures of all periods from Macedonia, exhibits from the excavations in the palace complex built by Galerius in the Thessaloniki city centre, a reconstruction of the façade of the Macedonian tomb in Agia Paraskevi, with genuine architectural members, and finds (mainly gold artefacts) of the Archaic and Classical periods from the Sindos cemetery. In all these rooms, certain important exhibits have been singled out and further information about them is given to help visitors appreciate the importance of each exhibit and of the area and the period from which it comes.

Apart from its permanent displays, the Archaeological Museum also hosts major temporary and thematic exhibitions. In the Manolis Andronikos Room, for instance, there is an exhibition titled &quot;The Coins of Macedonia from the 6th Century to 148 BC&quot;, with examples of coins that were circulating in Macedonia in that period. A showcase in the lobby of the museum displays some finds from the excavation of the Neolithic settlement at Makrygialos in Pieria, accompanied by information about the progress of the excavation.

In the new wing, the &quot;Gold of Macedon&quot; exhibition includes finds from numerous excavations in Central Macedonia. Taking the history of gold as its central theme, it presents the culture of Macedonia from the 6th century BC to 148 BC, discussing the use of gold (jewellery, sartorial decoration, gilding of objects and vessels, coins), the technology of the manufacture of gold jewellery, and the techniques of gold mining. There are also numerous finds from cemeteries and there are many descriptions about their role in burial customs.

The &quot;Thessaloniki in Prehistory&quot; exhibition aims to recreate a picture of the Thermaic Gulf littoral before the city of Thessaloniki was built. It presents the first excavations, which were carried out during the First World War by British and French troops, and finds from the most important prehistoric settlements in the area (Thermi, Vassilika, Stavroupoli, Oraiokastro, Assiros, Toumba, and Kastana) divided into three chronological groups (Neolithic, Early and Late Bronze Age).

=== Discovery of possible original statue of Alexander ===

On 26 February 2010, Greek authorities arrested two men found in illegal possession of various antiquities, including a bronze statue of Alexander, which is possibly a work of Lysippos. If confirmed, this would make it the first original work of Lysippos ever discovered. The statue is currently being examined at the laboratory of the museum, which is expected to confirm or deny its authenticity.

== Notable exhibits ==
* Derveni krater
* The statue of Harpocrates (2nd century AD)
* The Head of Serapis (2nd century BC)
* Bronze helmet and gold mask (cemetery of Sindos, end of 6th century BC)
* Marble door (Macedonia tomb of Agia Paraskevi)
* Copy of &quot;Unveiling&quot; Aphrodite (421/420 BC)
* Gold medals (250–225 BC)
* Inlaid floors (mosaic)
* Gold diadems, gold disks and gold Medusa heads (350-325 BC)
* Derveni Papyrus (end of 5th century BC)
* Plaster castings of Las Incantadas (the originals are in the Louvre)

<text>Clive () is a small town, ten kilometres from the city centres of both Napier and Hastings in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is close to the mouth of the Ngaruroro River.

The town is part of the Hastings district. It was named (like many of the towns in the vicinity) after a prominent person from imperial India, in this case Robert Clive, better known as &quot;Clive of India&quot;. The name was given by John Curling.

The town of Clive is mainly rural, yet with the increasing number of people moving into Hawke&#x27;s Bay, and Clive being at the meeting point of Hastings and Napier, new subdivisions are being built to accommodate the growing population.

Clive is home to the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Rowing Club who train on the Clive River. The Hawke&#x27;s Bay Rowing Regatta is held on the first weekend of the year and was started in 1872.

<text>Ana Torroja Fungairiño, 3rd Marchioness of Torroja (born 28 December 1959 in Madrid), is a Spanish singer. She was the lead singer of the pop trio Mecano, considered one of the most popular pop bands from Spain during the 1980s and 1990s. Mecano split in 1998 and she embarked on a solo career.

==Biography==
Formally styled Marquesa de Torroja, she succeeded to the title upon her father&#x27;s death in 2021.

Ana Torroja met José María Cano while studying economics at university. The two became good friends, and José María soon introduced her to his younger brother, Nacho. After hearing Ana sing José María&#x27;s guitar compositions, Nacho suggested that the three form a band. In 1981, at 22 years old she became the vocalist of Mecano.

After seven Mecano albums and huge success in Europe and Latin America, the continuous touring began taking its toll on the band. Ana was especially affected and started developing vocal problems. In an interview the artist recalls: &quot;“I am a person, even if it may not seem so, very shy and I am also a very reserved person with my other part, with my other half, with Ana just. So, being so exposed made me feel very vulnerable and that vulnerability became almost, almost agoraphobia, it didn&#x27;t really become agoraphobia. but I say it like this to explain a little what I felt, it scared me, I didn&#x27;t want to go outside because it couldn&#x27;t be me, because people immediately screamed, they went crazy, they wanted to touch you, they wanted to hug you, they wanted to hear from you, I felt like... how to explain it... like some kind of freak, and I didn&#x27;t like that feeling.”&quot;

In 1993, the band announced a temporary split. While José and Nacho released solo albums, Ana chose to travel around the world and visited Hawaii, Mumbai, and New York City—places she had sung about while with Mecano. She eventually settled in New York and took dance classes.

By 1997, Ana felt confident enough to sing again and moved to London to record her first solo album, &quot;Puntos Cardinales&quot; (&quot;Cardinal points&quot;). The album, produced by Tony Mansfield, marked a curious change for Ana. Because her new songs were not written from a male point of view—unlike the Mecano hits written by the Cano brothers—she felt that she could express herself as a woman for the first time. The first single from the album, &quot;A Contratiempo&quot;, was a Spanish-language cover of an old Bette Midler song, &quot;Bottomless&quot;. Both the album and the single went to No.1 in Spain.

In 1998, partially due to the cost and commercial failure of José María&#x27;s opera project, Mecano reunited for the double-disc greatest hits compilation &quot;Ana, José, Nacho&quot;, which also featured seven new songs.

Ana&#x27;s biggest solo success came in 1999 with her album, &quot;Pasajes de un Sueño&quot; (&quot;Passages of a dream&quot;). This album was hailed by critics and the first single, &quot;Ya No Te Quiero&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t love you anymore&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t want you anymore&quot;), became one of the best-selling songs in Spain that year. As a part of the promotion of this album, Torroja undertook, together with Miguel Bosé the &quot;Girados&quot; tour in May 2000, throughout Spain, the United States, and part of Latin America. The tour concluded at the beginning of the following year.

In 2001, Ana tried to reconquer the French audience she had won over at the time of Mecano, recording the album &quot;Ana Torroja&quot;.

She then took part in the recording of the disc &quot;Duetos 2&quot; by the Mexican artist Armando Manzanero, with whom she recorded the song &quot;Nada personal&quot; (&quot;Nothing personal&quot;).

In 2003 she published her third album &quot;Frágil&quot; (&quot;Fragile&quot;), in which she presented a more genuine pop-based image. For the album, she appeared for the first time solo on stage, in a brief tour across America and Europe called the &quot;Gira Frágil&quot; (Fragile Tour). It was this material that consolidated her success as a solo artist, and with which she also obtained numerous nominations and prizes such as the Grammy Latino, Shangay (Spain) and Oye (Mexico).

Shortly afterwards, she took a brief break from her musical career, guesting with artists such as Mexican singer, composer, and keyboard player Aleks Syntek in 2004. She dueted with Syntek on the song &quot;Duele el Amor&quot; (&quot;Love hurts&quot;), which was a major commercial success. That same year she did a duet with Italian singer Gigi D&#x27;Alessio, a new song called &quot;Bacio&quot; (&quot;kiss&quot;) in Italian, a cover of the same song also sung by Gigi D&#x27;Alessio with Anna Tatangelo.

In 2006, Ana released a new studio album called &quot;Me Cuesta Tanto Olvidarte&quot;, produced by Syntek. The album contained new versions of old Mecano hits. The first single was &quot;Los Amantes&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the Spanish charts.

In 2008, Ana decided to work with Schiller, singing &quot;Por qué te vas&quot;, which went to Number One in the Sehnsucht album charts in (Germany).

On 17 May 2008, Ana Torroja was invited by Aleks Syntek to take part in the macro concert of the Fundación ALAS, in aid of children in Latin America. She sang &quot;Me cuesta tanto olvidarte&quot;, &quot;Duele el amor&quot;, &quot;Corazones&quot;, and &quot;Te amaré&quot; (alongside all the invited artists).

On 10 October 2008, she was seriously injured in a car crash in Cádiz, from which she fully recovered.

Ana&#x27;s music has managed to spread further than just France and Germany. In 2010, British singer Jack Lucien announced that he had covered her song &quot;Hoy ya no te quiero&quot; for his forthcoming third studio album.

In October 2010 Ana released &quot;Sonrisa&quot; (Spanish for smile), her fifth original studio album in Spanish. The album was produced by the Venezuelan Andrés Levin, who also produced her second album. The recording of the album started in 2008, the album being originally scheduled for release in March 2009. The release had however been delayed due to her car accident in 2008. So far Sonrisa has been met with favourable reviews.

In 2023, she competed in the third season of the Spanish version of The Masked Singer as &quot;Ratita&quot; and was declared co-winner along Fernando Morientes, who competed as &quot;Gorila&quot;.

<doc id="1201069" wikidata="Q6258370" url="?curid=1201069" title="John Smith (British Army officer, born 1816)">
<text>John Smith (February 1814 – 26 June 1864) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Derbyshire in the United Kingdom, Smith enlisted in the army of the East India Company at the age of 23. Posted to India in 1839, Smith served through various campaigns, earning the Victoria Cross in 1857 at the Siege of Delhi. Smith died from dysentery in 1864.

== Life and career ==
Smith was born in Ashby Road, Ticknall, Derbyshire, in February 1814. After working as a cordwainer like his father and uncle, Smith enlisted with the private army of the East India Company in London on 3 October 1837. Following his training at the East India Company&#x27;s depot in Chatham, Smith embarked for India. Arriving on 2 August 1839 Smith was posted to the Bengal Sappers and Miners, subsequently arriving at the headquarters in Delhi then joining the 3rd Company of the Bengal Sappers and Miners. Smith was promoted to Sergeant in 1840.

Smith, then with the 5th Company of the Bengal Sappers and Miners in November 1841, served in a force under Brigadier Wild, taking part in the advance on Ali Masjid in the Khyber Pass. Smith then served throughout the 1842 campaign in Afghanistan, taking part in the successful storming of the Khyber Pass; the occupation of Jelalabad and the occupation of Kabul. Smith later rejoined the Headquarters of the Bengal Sappers and Miners at Delhi, and was shortly afterwards transferred to 7th Company, with whom he served in the later part of the Sutlej campaign. Smith was present at the battle of Sobraon and was awarded a medal for this. Posted to the 3rd Company, Smith served through the Punjab campaign in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, being present at the siege and capture of Multan and battle of Gujrat. For this service Smith was awarded the Punjab Medal with two clasps.

Smith was posted in 1851 to work with the Superintending Engineer of the Punjab, in the Department of Public Works, as an Acting Assistant Overseer attached to the Mian Mir Division, eventually becoming an Assistant Overseer in 1854. Smith was ordered to return to his regiment in 1856, and due to an error in the carrying out of this order Smith was mistakenly posted, at a reduced rank of Gunner, to the 3rd Company of the 4th Battalion of Bengal Artillery. Smith successfully protested against the order, leading to its rescinding and Smith being sent back to the Bengal Sappers and Miners at his former rank of Sergeant.
Smith remained at the depot in Rurki until the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in May 1857 when the a force from the Bengal Sappers and Miners were ordered to the immediate aid of the station at Meerut. The arrival of this force at Meerut on 13 May 1857 was met with hostility, and the Meerut authorities demanded that the Bengal Sappers and Miners be disarmed, leading to the mutiny of a large number of the force (killing their commanding officer in the process) which then left to join the rebels at Delhi, leaving 45 Non-commissioned Officers and Privates, and 124 loyal Indian sappers. After two weeks at Meerut, this group was ordered to join the Delhi Field Force, with Smith serving in operations through the siege.

== Victoria Cross ==

Smith was 43 years old, and a sergeant in the Bengal Sappers and Miners, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 14 September 1857 at Delhi, British India, Sergeant Smith with two lieutenants (Duncan Charles Home and Philip Salkeld) and Bugler Robert Hawthorne showed conspicuous gallantry in the blowing in the Kashmir Gate in broad daylight under heavy fire. His citation reads:
== Later career ==
Smith spent 1858 engaged in operations in Oudh and was awarded the Indian Mutiny Medal with &quot;Delhi&quot; clasp. In July 1859 Smith was appointed Sub-Conductor and acting Barrack Master for Jullundur and Phillour. Smith was promoted to Ensign on 17 March 1860. and later served as Barrack Master at Peshawar, Subathu and Darjeeling, returning in January 1864 to general duties at Amballa.

While on leave in Jullundur, Smith contracted dysentery there and died on 26 June 1864, following which he was buried in the Artillery Cemetery in Jullundur. The location of Smith&#x27;s Victoria Cross medal is unknown.

A memorial plaque commemorating Smith was placed on the wall of Ticknall Village Hall in 2014.

<text>The genus Poicephalus belongs to the subfamily [[Psittacinae]] of the true parrots (Psittacidae) and comprises ten species of parrots native to various regions of the Afrotropical realm, which encompasses Sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from Senegal in the west, Ethiopia in the east, and to South Africa in the south. Like lovebirds (&quot;[[Poicephalus|Agapornis]]&quot;) and vasa parrots (Coracopsis), the latter being endemic to Madagascar, the &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are typical specimens of Afrotropical zoogeography. Several of the species exist in slightly different forms, or subspecies.

&quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots have been kept as pets and companion birds for centuries, the Senegal parrot perhaps being the most famous species. The trade in this species most likely began in the early 19th century, when Senegal parrots first appeared as companion birds in Europe. Alongside African grey parrots, Senegal parrots still range among the mostly frequently imported parrots from Africa.

== Appearance ==
Members of the &quot;Poicephalus&quot; genus are stocky birds with short broad tails and relatively large heads and beaks that often differ in color from their trunks. Although they are parrots with rectrices of medium length, their pinion feathers reach down almost to the end of the rectrices, making their wings appear to be remarkably long.

According to H. Strunden, &quot;Poicephalus&quot;, from Ancient Greek, means &quot;grey head&quot; (&quot;poliós&quot; = grey and &quot;kephalé&quot; = head).

Most species in the &quot;Poicephalus&quot; genus are predominantly green. However, grey is also common, and the feathers on their heads frequently vary in colour from the rest of the plumage. Senegal parrots and brown-headed parrots for example have blackish or dark brown heads, while the head plumage of brown-necked and Cape parrots is grey-brown to silver-grey. With the exception of the red-fronted parrot, the different colours of head and body plumage of these four species do not overlap or blend. The red-fronted parrot only shows a more fluent transition, with merely the slate grey ear patches and the red front and crown clearly set apart. Another variation is found in male Rüppell&#x27;s parrots, whose brown plumage is overlaid with silver-grey at the ear patches and the top of their heads, with only a tinge of green on the top-side plumage. Female Rüppell&#x27;s parrots, on the other hand, have a bright blue back section, rump, and upper tail coverts, while the feathers on their lower ventral region and vent are a dull blue.

Several of the species show marked sexual dimorphism, Rüppell&#x27;s parrots, brown-necked parrots, cape parrots, and red-bellied parrots are dimorphic, the other species of &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots cannot be distinguished by the colours of their plumage. The difference is especially clear in red-bellied parrots, where males have red or bright orange plumage on breast, belly and below their wings while the feathers of females are all grey-brown in these areas.

The smallest species in the genus is the Meyer&#x27;s parrot, with adults reaching a body-length of only 22 centimeters (≈ 8,66 in.) and weighing approximately 120 g (≈ 4,23 oz). The largest species, the Cape parrot, by contrast, is usually almost as large as an African grey parrot, adult males reaching a size of 32 centimeters (≈ 12,6 in.) and a weight of about 400 g (≈ 14,1 oz).

Many &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots have bulky heads and powerful beaks, the colour of which varying with the species. While brown-headed parrots and Niam-Niam parrots have a grey upper mandible and an off-white lower one, other species have a homogeneously grey-coloured beak or a horn-coloured one with a darker tip.

The Cape parrot stands out with a particularly sturdy beak in relation to its overall size which it needs to obtain its main food source, the hard-shelled fruit of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; trees. British parrot specialist Rosemary Low has pointed out that, among the genus, only the Cape parrot is able to crack open walnuts with its beak. Except for macaws, this is a rare ability among parrots in general.

== Distribution ==
All ten species of &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots live in Africa, south of the Sahara. Their natural habitat ranges from the coastal regions of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in the north to the Drakensberg in South Africa and the northern edge of the Kalahari Desert and the Namib in the south. Thus &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots can be found in any tropical and subtropical habitat across Africa, except the high-altitude mountains, although they also live in the subtropical Afromontane regions and a geographical region where Kalahari desert and the South African Highveld merge. The Sahel and the two other deserts within their habitat (Namib and Kalahari Desert) are natural distribution boundaries because they are no appropriate biotopes for parrots. To the southeast, increasing deforestation limits their range. So much so that the Cape parrot populations, already considered one of the most threatened large parrot species of Africa, have become disjunct in an area reaching from the Eastern Cape Province to KwaZulu-Natal.

&quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots have spread to only a few islands on the African shore; while brown-headed parrots can be found on Pemba Island in the Indian Ocean, and Senegal parrots occur on the Îles de Los off the Guinean coast, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots have become extirpated from Zanzibar.

Normally, the distribution areas of the different &quot;Poicephalus&quot; species do not overlap but this may happen when food becomes scarce after longer periods of drought and the parrots are forced to migrate to find more abundant food sources. Then several different &quot;Poicephalus&quot; species can be found in one region. Other parrot species naturally occurring in the same distribution area as &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots include African grey parrots, African ring-necked parakeets, and different species of lovebirds like red-headed, black-collared, yellow-collared, rosy-faced, black-cheeked, black-winged, Fischer&#x27;s, and Lilian&#x27;s lovebirds.

== Habitat ==
With the exception of the Cape parrot, whose preferred food sources are &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and &quot;Celtis&quot; seeds, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are readily adaptable dietary generalists. This is why they were able to spread to such diverse habitats as lowland tropical rain forests, mangrove forests, rain as well as dry forests of different biomes, and the wooded parts of African savannahs.

Grey-headed parrots (&quot;P. f. suahelicus&quot;) and Meyer&#x27;s parrots have settled in an especially wide range of different habitats. The natural distribution of the grey-headed parrot ranges from wooded lowland savannahs to humid high-altitude rainforests, up to altitudes of 4000 m. Meyer&#x27;s parrots also occur in the moist forest regions of various life zones, as well as in shrub and grassland savannahs.

Occasionally, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots can be observed in agricultural areas, where they feed on fruit and grain.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Although &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are not related to the American Amazon parrots, they have come to occupy similar ecological niches and show some analogies in their behaviour.

Living mostly in small family groups consisting of adult birds and their young, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots sometimes form loose larger groups with other families. If there is plenty of food available, those groups may comprise up to 100 birds.

Even though some groups of &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots sometimes cause losses in orchards, maize or millet fields near settlement areas, they are generally shy and keep away from humans.

&quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots spend the nights in treetops, returning to the same roosting tree regularly. At dusk, they start preening before then leaving for their feeding grounds; loud calls usually announce the birds&#x27; departure. Depending on the food supplies available, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are able to cover large distances: brown-necked parrots have been known to fly ca. 80 km (≈ 50 miles) in search of food. Subpopulations of red-fronted parrots have been observed roosting in higher altitude areas before descending to their sources of food, overcoming a difference in altitude of about 300 m. After feeding in the morning, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots often rest in treetops in the vicinity of the respective food source, alternately sleeping or dozing and preening. They return to their feeding grounds once more in the late afternoon before leaving for their nocturnal roosts.

== Diet ==
Most &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are dietary generalists, feeding on seeds, fruit, and leaves of different kinds of trees and shrubs. Blossoms rich in nectar and accessory fruit are also part of their diet as well as insects, although the latter never make up a great part of their food. Because their diet does not contain enough water to cover the parrots&#x27; need, they require sources of water within their habitats.

The Cape parrot is a notable exception among the &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots since it is an oligophagous dietary specialist feeding mostly on the seeds of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and &quot;Celtis&quot; trees. Apart from trapping and habitat loss, It is probably for this reasons that the Cape parrot is an endangered species, listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the IUCN.

Some &quot;Poicephalus&quot; species like Senegal and Meyer&#x27;s parrots are partial migrants, thus compensating for scarce or seasonally fluctuating food supplies. They only migrate out of breeding season.

== Breeding ==
At the earliest, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots start breeding when they are three years old. Then they nest in natural tree-holes found in large trees such as African baobabs and carob trees, where their nesting sites are most commonly found. Cape parrots, however, prefer &quot;Podocarpus&quot; trees and red-bellied parrots are known to nest in cavities of termite mounds. No nesting materials are collected.

A clutch of eggs usually consists of two to four eggs, laid within one to four days and incubated solely by the female through 26 to 28 days. Meanwhile, the male feeds the female and stays close to the nesting site until some days after the chicks have hatched. As soon as the female no longer has to warm the chicks permanently, the male also begins to feed them. The hatchlings&#x27; weight could only be measured in captive breeding so far and is five (Meyer&#x27;s parrot) to six (brown-headed parrot) gram (≈ 0,18 to 0,21 oz). The chicks are covered in white or light grey downy feathers and their usually rather noisy parents become more quiet and watchful while around the nest.

How long the non-captive hatchlings stay in the nest is poorly known, more precise observations of wild specimens are only available for Cape parrots and brown-necked parrots. Young Cape parrots remain in the nesting cavity for up to 79 days, while the brown-necked parrot chicks leave their home on the 69th day. Reliable data concerning Senegal and brown-headed parrots bear on the observation of captive parrots which revealed that the fledgling period of Senegal parrots varied between nine and eleven weeks while young brown-headed parrots left the nest during the twelfth week of their lives. The male kept feeding them until they were fifteen weeks old.

== Predators, parasites, and typical illnesses ==
Sitting females and nestlings are especially vulnerable to predation, e.g. by dasypeltes, boomslangs, monitor lizards like savannah and Nile monitors, baboons, civets, and mongooses. The African harrier-hawk likewise sometimes robs the nests, holding on to the entrance of the cavity with one claw and grabbing the nestlings with the other. The mentioned predators mostly capture eggs and fledgling birds, while adult birds may be hunted by eagles, hawks, falcons, and sparrowhawks of appropriate size.

The most common ectoparasites found on &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are feather mites and bird lice that live on the birds&#x27; feathers and skin. Like other wild animals, &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots may be infested with internal parasites like Coccidia, Ascaridida, &quot;Capillaria nematodes&quot;, and Cestoda (tapeworms).

Little is known about diseases typical of wild &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots but the examination of Cape parrots and Rüppell&#x27;s parrots found that parts of these populations are infected with the virus that causes the Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). There is still no treatment available for this often fatal disease and although some birds may show no symptoms, they may nonetheless spread the virus they carry.

== Population ==

The population dynamics and conservation status of the various &quot;Poicephalus&quot; species are heterogeneous, ranging from &quot;least concern&quot; to &quot;endangered&quot;. More extensive field studies have been undertaken only in South Africa and Namibia so far, hence the most reliable data come from those regions and the species and subspecies living there. According to the World Parrot Trust online encyclopedia, the numbers of most &quot;Poicephalus&quot; species remain unknown but are assumed to be stable, with the exception of red-fronted parrots, whose population seems to be decreasing. Hoppe and Welcke point out that data about the population development of &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots are often either inconsistent or obsolete, if they exist at all.

Whereas red-bellied parrots and Senegal parrots are apparently still rather frequent, some subspecies of otherwise stable species of &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrots have become endangered due to habitat loss and trapping. This holds true for the &quot;Poicephalus gulielmi fantiensis&quot; subspecies of the red-fronted parrot, for example, which has come under threat because of extensive deforestation and trapping (although The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) makes trade in such birds illegal).

There are as yet no reliable data concerning the Niam-Niam parrot native to the Chad and Central African Republic and the yellow-fronted parrot endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands. Because of intense deforestation in its habitat, the population of the yellow-fronted parrot is probably declining. Information regarding brown-headed parrots and Rueppell&#x27;s parrots are contradictory. While some studies suggest that both species have become very rare all over their respective range, other studies claim that both species are declining in numbers but are not critically endangered yet.

Of those species where reliable data is available, the most critically endangered &quot;Poicephalus&quot; species is the Cape parrot which largely depends on &quot;Podocarpus&quot; seeds for his diet. With many areas of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; trees in decline due to forest clearance this species is threatened with extinction. In 2018, only 1.453 specimens of wild Cape parrots were counted, which might indicate a slight increase compared to 2004, even though the data come from different sources.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Poicephalus&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1837. The type species was subsequently designated as the Senegal parrot. The name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;phaios&quot; &quot;grey&quot; and &quot;-kephalos&quot; &quot;headed&quot;.

The genus contains ten species.

*Red-fronted parrot, or Jardine&#x27;s parrot, &quot;P. gulielmi&quot;
*Yellow-fronted parrot, &quot;P. flavifrons&quot;
*Brown-necked parrot, or uncape parrot, &quot;P. fuscicollis&quot;
*Cape parrot, or Levaillant&#x27;s parrot, &quot;P. robustus&quot;
*Meyer&#x27;s parrot, &quot;P. meyeri&quot;
*Rüppell&#x27;s parrot, &quot;P. rueppellii&quot;
*Brown-headed parrot, &quot;P. cryptoxanthus&quot;
*Niam-Niam parrot, &quot;P. crassus&quot;
*Senegal parrot, &quot;P. senegalus&quot;
*Red-bellied parrot, &quot;P. rufiventris&quot;

==Species==
== Subspecies ==
The Cape parrot and red-fronted parrot form a superspecies complex.

== In aviculture and human care ==
The Senegal parrot, Meyer&#x27;s parrot, red-bellied parrot, and the brown-headed parrot are popular as pets because they are easier to keep in apartments, being generally quieter and smaller than most other companion parrots. Some &quot;Poicephalus&quot; parrot species are rare and not known in captivity.

While some &quot;Poicephalus&quot; populations have come under pressure from habitat loss, others are affected by trapping for the pet trade. For example, while it is still listed as &quot;least concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List, the Senegal parrot is one of the species most frequently caught from the wild, with 735,775 birds recorded in international trade since 1981.

<text>Intercalated discs or lines of Eberth are microscopic identifying features of cardiac muscle. Cardiac muscle consists of individual heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) connected by intercalated discs to work as a single functional syncytium. By contrast, skeletal muscle consists of multinucleated muscle fibers and exhibits no intercalated discs. Intercalated discs support synchronized contraction of cardiac tissue in a wave-like pattern so that the heart can work like a pump. They occur at the Z line of the sarcomere and can be visualized easily when observing a longitudinal section of the tissue.

==Structure==
Intercalated discs are complex structures that connect adjacent cardiac muscle cells. The three types of cell junction recognised as making up an intercalated disc are desmosomes, fascia adherens junctions, and gap junctions.

* Fascia adherens are anchoring sites for actin, and connect to the closest sarcomere.
* Desmosomes prevent separation during contraction by binding intermediate filaments, anchoring the cell membrane to the intermediate filament network, joining the cells together. 
* Gap junctions connect the cytoplasms of neighboring cells electrically allowing cardiac action potentials to spread between cardiac cells by permitting the passage of ions between cells, producing depolarization of the heart muscle.

All of these junctions work together as a single unit called the area composita.

==Clinical significance==
Mutations in the intercalated disc gene are responsible for various cardiomyopathies that can lead to heart failure.

Ruptured intercalated discs, when seen on histopathology, have two main causes:
*Microtome sectioning, thereby being a visual artifact.
*Forceful myocardial contraction, in turn mainly caused by ventricular fibrillation or electrical injury.
Additional signs indicating forceful myocardial contraction are:
*Alternating bundles of hypercontracted myocytes with hyperdistended ones.
*Square-shaped myocardiocyte nuclei.
*Hyperdistended myocardiocytes with detached sarcomeres, and in proximity of hypercontracted myocardiocytes.

<text>VEF, Latvian acronym for Valsts elektrotehniskā fabrika (&quot;State Electrotechnical Factory&quot;), was a manufacturer of electrical and electronic products in Riga, Latvia. It was founded in 1919. Before World War II, it manufactured a large variety of goods, including Minox — then the world&#x27;s smallest camera. After the war, it was the leading communication technology producer in the Soviet Union and the largest factory in the Latvian SSR.

==History==
VEF was established in April 1919 as The Main Workshops of the Latvian Post and Telegraph Department ( (PTVGD)), where, initially, the five mechanics were the only employees. In 1924 the factory was moved for the first time, and in 1928 moved again to VEF&#x27;s current location. The factory buildings were built in late 19th and early 20th century and span a city block. Before World War I the buildings were owned by 1887-established Russian-Baltic factory &quot;UNION&quot;, established by Heinrich Dettmann. The company was renamed to VEF in 1932.

In 1922 PTVGD started to manufacture phones. In 1924 it started producing crystal-detector radios. In 1928 it began producing automatic telephone exchanges. They bought the license from Mix &amp; Genest to produce small volume (for 100, 200, 300 numbers) and large volume (1000, 2000 numbers) switchboards. Telephone exchange in Riga and Latvia&#x27;s populated places were upgraded with equipment manufactured by PTVGD until 1940. During the 1930s the monthly production of PTVGD included 500 phones and 400 exchanges.
By the 1930s the factory produced all electronics that had any market demand - communication devices, phones, light bulbs, cameras, irons, radios, flashlights, as well as photo paper, work-tables, and even airplanes. They also repaired cars.

VEF entered the world market in 1936 with the development of the Minox subminiature camera, designed by Walter Zapp (). It was the world&#x27;s smallest camera at the time.

Between 1928 and 1933 VEF also produced a small, inexpensive car.

During World War II the factory was looted and several buildings were destroyed by explosions. The factory was repaired after the war and it quickly recovered. During the 1960s VEF produced seven radio receivers and five phones every minute and two out of three phones in Soviet Union were produced by VEF. It also manufactured highly demanded transistor-based radios &quot;Spīdola&quot; and in the 1970s — &quot;VEF&quot;.

During the Soviet period, VEF specialized in electronics and was a part of Latvia&#x27;s electronic industry, which supplied the former Soviet Union with telecommunications equipment and electronics for the military. The five largest state companies were VEF, Radiotehnika, Elfa, Komutators and Elar (which produced components for the other four). In its peak in 1991, VEF employed 20,000 people. Its best known products were telephones, telephone exchanges and radios.

The Latvian electronics industry had trouble competing with Western companies when the markets were opened in the early 1990s. Cited problems included poor service and product quality. Attempts to restructure these companies were not successful and their combined production fell more than 90% between 1993 and 1997. VEF was divided into six smaller companies, most of which no longer exist. Three remaining ones, VEF un Ko, VEF TELEKOM and VEF Radiotehnika RRR, employ between 100 and 200 people each.

In 1999 the factory was privatized and reorganized. VEF un Ko, which still is active, has recently focused its attention on designing and building UAVs for agricultural use.

== Building ==
The large assembly hall and administrative building, built in 1899 and designed by architect Heinrich Scheel (1829–1909), have eclectic facades facing Brīvības iela. The decorative facade of the assembly hall features a statue of Zeus with lightning bolts in hand. In 1912, a production building with a high tower in the courtyard, designed by German architect Peter Behrens (1868–1940), was constructed under the supervision of Riga civil engineer Friedrich Wilhelm Seuberlich (1850-?). In 1914, another production building was built according to Behrens&#x27; design, located at the corner of Brīvības iela and Bērzaunes iela, under the supervision of architect Friedrich Scheffel (1865–1915). The upper floor, which was supposed to be incorporated into the high roof as per the project, remained unrealized.

In 2017, the 1899 building was renovated by Latvian network hardware manufacturer MikroTik which established its headquarters there. The adjacent building, built in 1900, is also renovated and most notably used by Accenture Latvia since the 2000s.

<doc id="1201104" wikidata="Q6692599" url="?curid=1201104" title="Loving (novel)">
<text>Loving is a 1945 novel by British writer Henry Green. &quot;Time&quot; included the novel in its &quot;TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;. One of his most admired works, &quot;Loving&quot; describes life above and below stairs in an Irish country house during the Second World War. In the absence of their employers the Tennants, the servants enact their own battles and conflict amid rumours about the war in Europe; invading one another&#x27;s provinces of authority to create an anarchic environment of self-seeking behaviour, pilfering, gossip and love.

In a 1958 interview in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, Terry Southern asked Green about his inspiration for &quot;Loving&quot;. Green replied: &quot;I got the idea of &quot;Loving&quot; from a manservant in the Fire Service during the war. He was serving with me in the ranks, and he told me he had once asked the elderly butler who was over him what the old boy most liked in the world. The reply was: &#x27;Lying in bed on a summer morning, with the window open, listening to the church bells, eating buttered toast with cunty fingers.&#x27; I saw the book in a flash.&quot;

==Television film==
An adaptation for a television film by Maggie Wadey was produced by the BBC and screened in 1996. It starred Mark Rylance and Georgina Cates.

<text>Herbert J. Storing (January 28, 1928 – September 9, 1977) was an American political scientist with broad ranging interests who is best known for reviving the serious study of the American Founding. The constitutional theorist and American politics scholar Walter Berns called him &quot;the most profound man I have encountered in the field of American studies.&quot;

== Career ==
Storing received his A.B. degree from Colgate University in 1950. He then attended the University of Chicago, earning his A.M. in 1951 and Ph.D. in 1956. His dissertation chair was C. Herman Pritchett and he studied with Leonard D. White, Robert Horn and Leo Strauss. He was a Fulbright Scholar to the United Kingdom from 1953 to 1955 and also received research grants from the Rockefeller, Ford, and Relm Foundations and from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Storing served as senior research assistant at the London School of Economics; as assistant, associate, and professor of political science at the University of Chicago (1956–77) where he worked closely with Joseph Cropsey; and as director of the Telluride summer program at the Hampton Institute in 1967. He was Visiting Charles Evans Hughes Professor of Jurisprudence at Colgate University from 1968 to 1969, and part-time professor of political science at Northern Illinois University from 1969 to 1975.

Storing submitted suggested text for the bicentennial speeches of President Gerald Ford and, together with Martin Diamond, testified before Congress regarding the Electoral College.

At the time of his death in September 1977, Storing was Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia, where he also served as director of the Study of the Presidency at the White Burkett Miller Center for Public Affairs. He was also a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on White House Fellows.

== Thought and scholarship ==
=== American Founding ===
Prior to Storing, 20th-century scholars tended to study the American Founding Fathers from the standpoint of historicism, contextualism, and ideological history. The approaches characterized the political thought of all of the founders as tethered to the extant practices and opinions of the late 18th and the early 19th centuries. Characteristic of that approach was Charles A. Beard’s 1913 book &quot;Economic Interpretation of the Constitution&quot;, which maintained that &quot;the structure of the Constitution of the United States was motivated primarily by the personal financial interests of the Founding Fathers.&quot;

In contrast, Storing helped create a new approach to the American founding within the fields of political science and political theory, one whose principles held that the thought of the American founders could and should be understood as relevant to the contemporary study of politics. For Storing, that meant engaging with the arguments of the founders on their own terms, as opposed to reading those arguments primarily in light of the social, political, and economic conditions that likely shaped them. Storing by no means denied the relevance of these conditions in attaining an informed view of what the founders thought. Indeed, as Storing emphasizes in his essay, &quot;The Other Federalists,&quot; most writers from the founding period &quot;were&quot; bound to the consensus opinions of their times. What distinguished Storing&#x27;s approach was his openness to founding thinkers like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, who saw further and thought more deeply than their contemporaries did about the nature of political life and institutions and so whose thought cannot simply be reduced either to personal motivations or shared opinions.

Emblematic of Storing&#x27;s concern with the founding is his treatment of the Federalist-Anti-Federalist debates, to whose study he contributed his 1981 seven-volume study, &quot;The Complete Anti-Federalist&quot;, which was described by a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer as &quot;a work of magnificent scholarship&quot; and its publication a &quot;civic event of enduring importance.&quot; Storing believed that the debate illuminated the deepest commitments of the American regime because the Anti-Federalists felt it was in their interest to expose the true character of the new constitutional order. The debate was made profound because the critique of the proposed constitution developed by the most thoughtful of the Anti-Federalists, such as Brutus or the penetrating writer Mercy Warren, forced the Federalists to give a more sophisticated defense of their creation than they might otherwise have done. For Storing, the issues raised in this debate, some of which were unresolved at the time and remain unresolved today, pertain to the essential nature of the American regime, and are therefore of enduring relevance to scholars of all aspects of American politics.

=== Race and politics ===
Storing began teaching and writing about race and politics well before the topic became important for the field of political science. For example, Storing published his first writing on race and politics, &quot;The School of Slavery: A Reconsideration of Booker T. Washington,&quot; in 1964, whereas the Race, Ethnicity, and Politics section of the American Political Science Association was not founded until 1995. His singular contribution was to show how black Americans are culturally in the position to see the American regime more clearly than do white Americans.

For Storing, the lens through which black Americans view their country can &quot;provide a clean, sharp view of America, exposing its innermost and fundamental principles and tendencies, which are largely ignored or vaguely seen through half-closed eyes by the majority of white Americans, whose circumstances do not compel them to look at their country and to wonder about it.&quot; Because black people experience political, social, and economic alienation in ways that white people do not, they are in a position &quot;to take seriously the possibility of revolution, or rejection, or separation. [They] thus [share] the perspective of a serious revolutionary.&quot; Seeing the American regime as a genuine revolutionary means appealing &quot;from the imperfect world of convention and tradition…to the world of nature and truth. In important respects, then, black Americans are like a revolutionary or…a founding generation…[T]hey are in the difficult but potentially glorious position of not being able to take for granted given political arrangements and values, or having seriously to canvass alternatives, to think through their implications, and to make a deliberate choice.&quot;

Relatedly, Storing articulated and developed Frederick Douglass’ critique of the constitutional theory that was (ironically) shared by the radical abolitionists—such as William Lloyd Garrison—and the defenders of slavery—such as Roger Brooke Taney. Following Douglass’ insights, Storing contended that while &quot;peripheral&quot; elements of the 1789 Constitution either maintained slavery—the &quot;three-fifths clause&quot; and the &quot;fugitive slave clause&quot;—or tacitly acknowledged it—the clause prohibiting the outlawing of the slave trade until after 1808—the &quot;core&quot; elements of the Constitution were progressively egalitarian.

=== Public administration and the public interest ===
Storing emphasized the importance of the common good, as opposed to the mere aggregation of competing goods, in thinking about how individuals and groups relate to the polity to which they belong. As a consequence, Storing developed a searching critique both of the idea of scientific administration and of theories of pluralism and group politics. For Storing, &quot;[j]ust what specific civil rights and duties flow from government’s origin in natural rights is by no means obvious and thus defines much of the task of both lawmakers and jurists in a liberal political order.&quot; For this reason, genuine political judgement is an essential component of both interest group politics and public administration. In this regard, Storing questioned theories of interest group politics and public administration which sought to diminish the role of political judgement and to emphasize the promise of purely scientific—i.e., non &quot;value-based&quot;—determinations as to how resources ought to be distributed in a regime. Specifically, Storing challenged &quot;the radical disjunction between deciding what to do (&quot;politics&quot; determining the end) and actually carrying it out (&quot;administration&quot; fixing the means).&quot;

In respect to the American constitutional order in particular, Storing argued (contrary to many scholars of constitutional law and the American founding) that founders such as Hamilton and Madison had a developed sense of robust administration and that the constitutive choices they made in framing the architecture of the American regime prefigured and set in motion what many today call &quot;big government.&quot; Unlike their Anti-Federalist opponents who believed that &quot;republics had to be small enough that citizens would identify their private interests with the public good and would willingly carry out the laws with little need for governmental compulsion or force.&quot; Storing showed that leading Federalists were committed to a political future in which uniform and effective administration would not depend on citizens’ private virtue, but rather would be guaranteed by the workings of a carefully designed central government.

=== Statesmanship and the American presidency ===
In his writings on and the American Presidency, Storing &quot;sketches the essential elements of democratic statesmanship and their grounding in the American constitutional order.&quot; Storing questioned the views that the American presidency is either a purely administrative institution designed merely to carry out the will of the Congress (thereby fulfilling the ancillary role described and critiqued by Richard Neustadt) or that the President is a unitary executive with discretion on its own, and accountable to no other elements in the regime (e.g., the Congress) besides the people at large. Storing argued that &quot;[t]he beginning of wisdom about the American presidency is to see that it contains both principles [i.e., the administrative and the political] and to reflect on their complex and subtle relation.&quot; Following Hamilton in the &quot;Federalist&quot;, Storing sought to elucidate why energy is so fundamental to executive power and how the institutional design of Article II induces energetic presidential leadership in its office holders; he also sought to explain how the presidency is designed not merely to serve popular will but, at times, to discipline and direct it.

Relatedly, Storing distinguished between different conceptions of statesmanship and how they relate to constitutional government. In particular, he identified &quot;old&quot; statesmanship as political leadership that actually forges and imposes a political identity and ethical norms on a people—i.e., the kind of leadership exercised by the American founders. This he distinguished from a narrower form of statesmanship that is compatible with constitutional liberalism and its toleration of diverse conceptions of the good life.

== Personal life and teaching ==
Storing was born on January 29, 1928, in Ames, Iowa. His father, James A. Storing, was a professor, Provost and, for a time, acting president of Colgate University. He served in the U.S. Army after World War II, from 1946 to 1948.

Storing was an unusually dedicated graduate teacher and adviser. As his close friend Walter Berns recalled, &quot;It seemed to me that he must have served on at least half of the [University of Chicago political science] department’s dissertation committees, a disproportionate number as chairman. At any rate, I have a memory of manuscripts piled on his desk awaiting his attention. Unlike some professors I have known, Storing read them all with great care. His students will attest to this.&quot;

Storing regularly provided his graduate students with further opportunities to learn outside of the classroom, hosting extra-curricular seminars as well as reading groups. As his colleague Joseph Cropsey wrote: &quot;Storing was a powerful, extremely influential teacher. The forthrightness and uprightness of the scholar in his writing were forcefully manifest in the man as presence. His logic straightened his thought without hardening his heart; his students learned from his example the difference between sentiment and sentimentality.&quot;

<text>Little Stoke is a village in the parish of Stoke Gifford, situated in South Gloucestershire, England. It is surrounded by Patchway, Stoke Gifford and Bradley Stoke. Home to Patchway railway station, a minor stop on the railway network, the railway line separates Little Stoke from the large Rolls-Royce factories in nearby Filton. Gipsy Patch Lane Bridge provides access under the line.

Little Stoke is home to a large playing field and a community hall. The community hall is now home to a café - ‘Little Stoke Community Cafe’. Near the railway arch are some local shops including a post office.

Many of the road names are linked to engines produced in the 1950s and 1960s at what is now the Rolls-Royce factory. The area originally consisted of many council houses and post World War II prefabs. In recent years, some of the houses have been renovated; however, some owners have kept the older style of house.

Little Stoke has one Public House, The Stokers (formally The Magpies), on Gipsy Patch Lane, and one Social Club (Little Stoke Social Club), on Braydon Avenue.

School children attend Little Stoke Primary School and then move on to AbbeyWood High School, on New Road in nearby Filton; or to the nearby Patchway High School. Some pupils travel further afield to Bradley Stoke Community School in Bradley Stoke The Ridings High School in Winterbourne or to The Castle School or Marlwood School (in Thornbury and Alveston respectively).

Stoke Gifford Parish Council gained notoriety amongst the running world when it became the first council to vote to impose a charge on runners who run at Little Stoke parkrun every Saturday morning. parkrun organises free running events in over 800 parks worldwide and this was the first and only council to take this step when it made its decision on 12 April 2016 by a vote of 6 to 4. The Parish Council cited wear and tear on paths as its justification. Because of this, Little Stoke parkrun has now closed.
Little Stoke has a football team called Stokeside FC who play in the Bristol &amp; District League as well as Little Stoke F.C who currently play in the Gloucestershire County League and Stoke Lane, which gets its name from the road Stoke Lane, which runs through Little Stoke. The club&#x27;s home shirt for all the teams is black and white stripes.

Martin Davis, who lived at Little Stoke Farm, has published a book about local history: &quot;The Farmer and the Goose with the Golden Eyes: A Celebration of a Vanished Part of Rural South Gloucestershire and the Founding of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge&quot;.

<text>The Chilean Navy () is the naval warfare service branch of the Chilean Armed Forces. It is under the Ministry of National Defense. Its headquarters are at Edificio Armada de Chile, Valparaiso.

==History==
===Origins and the Wars of Independence (1817–1830)===


The origins of the Chilean Navy date back to 1817, when General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins prophetically declared after the Chilean victory at the Battle of Chacabuco that a hundred such victories would count for nothing if Chile did not gain control of the sea.

This led to the development of the Chilean Navy, and the first legal resolutions outlining the organization of the institution were created. Chile&#x27;s First National Fleet and the Academy for Young Midshipmen, which was the predecessor of the current Naval Academy, were founded, as well as the Marine Corps and the Supply Commissary.

The first commander of the Chilean Navy was Manuel Blanco Encalada. Famous British naval commander Lord Cochrane, who formerly had been a captain in the British royal navy, was hired by Chileans to organize and command their Navy. Cochrane recruited an almost all-anglophone complement of officers and midshipmen and crews of British, Irish, and American seamen. He became a key figure in the war against loyalist forces in Peru, and was instrumental in taking control of the fortresses of Valdivia, though he failed in his attempt to conquer Chiloé Island.

In March 1824, the Chilean Navy and Army undertook an expedition to expel the Spanish from Chiloé Archipelago. An expedition was dispatched to Chiloé Island, but it ended in failure when the Chilean Army led by Jorge Beauchef was defeated at the Battle of Mocopulli. Only after Ramón Freire&#x27;s Chiloé expedition in 1826 did the royalist forces at Chiloé, under the command of Antonio de Quintanilla, surrender and Chiloé joined the new Chilean nation.

===Age of exploration, territorial expansion, and wars (1830–1885)===
After the wars of independence, a series of conflicts demonstrated the importance of the navy to the nation. First of these conflicts were the War of the Confederation (1836–1839), the Chincha Islands War (1864–1866), and the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). The founding of Fuerte Bulnes in the Strait of Magellan marked the starting point of a series of Chilean Navy explorations, led by navy hydrographers, such as Francisco Vidal Gormaz and Francisco Hudson, in the unknown zone between the Strait of Magellan and Chiloé. To deal with this new area of activity, the navy founded in 1874 the Hydrographic Office, whose first director was Francisco Vidal Gormaz.

Chilean war hero and martyr Arturo Prat is regarded as the ultimate example of the commitment of the navy to its country, after his death while leading a boarding party onto the enemy ironclad at the naval battle of Iquique on 21 May 1879, during the War against Peru and Bolivia. The anniversary of this battle is celebrated every year as a public holiday called &quot;Día de las Glorias Navales&quot;. Prat is also considered to be one of the co-founders of the Naval Seaman Training School in 1868, which began operating a year later, and was one of the Naval Academy&#x27;s finest graduate officers that in 1943 it became the National Naval School &quot;Arturo Prat&quot; in his honor.

The navy further distinguished itself during the Battle of Pisagua in 1879, led by both the Navy and the Marine Artillery Groups and Marine Infantry, the world&#x27;s first modern military landing operation, that resulted in Chilean victories in other parts of Peru&#x27;s Tarapacá region, and resulted to its annexation by Chile.

After navy visits to Easter Island in 1875 and 1887, Chilean navy officer Policarpo Toro managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into Chile with native Rapanui in 1888. By occupying Easter Island, Chile joined the imperial nations.

With the Peruvian Navy destroyed, Bolivia becoming a landlocked country, and Argentina having only a brown-water navy, the Chilean Navy had a regional hegemony in the years following the War of the Pacific. To secure this advantage and not let new Argentine acquisitions challenge Chilean naval power, the Chilean government decided to modernize its navy. The modernization plan included the ordering of two cruisers and two torpedo boat destroyers, and the modernization of two armoured ships in English docks.

===Civil war and arms race (1885–1902)===

A new predreadnought battleship, , was ordered under the new construction program in 1889. The advent of the 1891 Chilean Civil War had a breach between the two branches of the Chilean armed forces, while the bulk of navy sided with the congress side, the majority of the Chilean Army remained loyal to José Manuel Balmaceda. When the majority of the national congress broke relations with the government, Jorge Montt took control of the fleet at Valparaíso and with notable politicians, such as Ramón Barros Luco, on board, the fleet sailed north to the nitrate-rich Tarapacá area, which Chile had seized from Peru 10 years earlier. Tarapacá was, by that time, Chile&#x27;s richest region in terms of natural resources and was without the fleet practically out of reach for the Chilean Army. From here, the navy organized an army made of nitrate miners, whom they armed and trained to face the 40,000-men-strong Army of Chile. In August 1891, the new army was disembarked in Quintero and defeated the Chilean Army at the Battle of Concón and the Battle of Placilla before the presidential faction disbanded and the Congressional side took power. On the elections of October 1891, Jorge Montt was elected president.

Not all navy officers sided with the congress. Some like Juan Williams Rebolledo, Juan José Latorre and Policarpo Toro remained on the presidential side and Francisco Vidal Gormaz declared his neutrality. After the war these officers were removed from their offices. In contrast to these officers whose career or influence in the navy was truncated by the war, the 1891 Chilean Civil War served as a starting point of a successful career in the navy for a generation of young officers like Francisco Nef and others who sided with the Congressionals who won the war.

After incidents with Chile in 1872, 1877, and 1878, Argentina had decided that a brown-water navy, even if modern, was not enough to back up its ambitions in Patagonia and the South Atlantic. Both countries were distracted in the next few years by Argentina&#x27;s internal military operations against natives and Chile&#x27;s War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890, a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between the two. The Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina had been a major success in laying the groundwork for nearly all of Chile and Argentina&#x27;s of shared borders, but the drawing of boundaries in the largely unexplored inland Patagonia soon became a major source of territorial disputes. Over the 1880s and 1890s, Chile and Argentina engaged in an arms race fueled by nationalistic rhetoric and tax income from their blooming economies. Both countries signed a treaty in 1902 to end the arms race.

During the 1890s, the Chilean Navy carried out many hydrographic surveys in the Patagonian channels aimed to improve navigation, and explored the river basins of Patagonia. A German geographer, Hans Steffen, led navy explorations to western Patagonia, laying the groundwork for colonization of what would be Aisén Region years later. The navy occasionally collaborated with European naturalists such as Carl Skottsberg in their surveys of Chilean territory.

===Depression and mutiny (1902–1950)===
In 1904, Brazil ordered two dreadnoughts to be built by the United Kingdom. In response, Argentina ordered two dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States. They also ordered 12 destroyers from three nations in Europe. With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels, Chile was forced to respond, although this was delayed by a financial depression brought on by a major earthquake and a drastic fall in the nitrate market in 1906 and 1907, respectively. Eventually, Chile ordered two &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;-class super-dreadnoughts and six &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot;-class destroyers from British shipyards, but received only two destroyers before the rest were purchased by the Royal Navy during World War I; of these, Chile would finally receive three destroyers and one battleship, the &quot;Almirante Latorre&quot;, after the War.

Chile also received six British H-class submarines from the Royal Navy in 1917, and purchased three &quot;Capitan O&#x27;Brien&quot;-class submarines and six &quot;Serrano&quot;-class destroyers in the late 1920s. Its fleet of cruisers, though, all built in the 1890s, were totally outdated by the time the Great Depression forced their retirements without replacements.

In 1931, the navy once more made headlines in Chilean politics when large portions of it (26 ships) began a mutiny that demanded the president to rescind a salary reduction. The demands were later expanded to include an agrarian reform, industrial &quot;solidarity&quot;, and the payment of the external debt by the &quot;millionaires&quot;. The mutineers had their ships located at Coquimbo and Talcahuano&#x27;s naval base, which they controlled. Chilean government responded by sending the Chilean Air Force to bombard the ships in Coquimbo and charging Talcahuano&#x27;s naval base. After the quelling of the rebellion, the navy was purged, although the mutiny had its origin among the lower ranks.

These economic and political factors, along with Chile&#x27;s neutrality for much of World War II, meant that the navy did not acquire any warships until after the war.

===Role in Antarctica, incidents with Argentina, and the navy in the government (1950–1990)===

Chile formulated its Antarctic claim in 1940. In 1947, the navy established the first Chilean base, the Captain Arturo Prat Base, on the continent before the Chilean Army or Air Force established their own bases. Since then, the navy has played a major role in supplying Chilean bases and performing numerous rescue missions, among them, the in 1972 and 2007.

The Navy&#x27;s most recognizable sailing-school ship, the , began operations in 1952. It since has made various trips around the world with selected cadet officers and NCOs on board trained in ship handling and operations, as a requirement for graduation. Prior to the &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, another sailing ship, the &quot;General Baquedano&quot;, fulfilled the same functions.

In the 1950s, the Chilean Navy became involved in a series of incidents with the Argentine Navy and Argentine civilians in the disputed areas of the Beagle Channel and Cape Horn. These incidents took the form of incursions into Chilean waters by Argentine fishing ships, and provocations, such as the shelling of a Chilean lighthouse by the Argentine Navy during the Snipe incident of 1958. During the late 1970s, the Chilean Navy played an important role in defending Chilean sovereignty over the Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands that the Argentine Navy planned to seize.

The birth of the modern Chilean Marine Corps of today began in 1964. Naval educational institutions were reformed in 1968, when president Eduardo Frei Montalva created the &quot;Naval Specialities Schools System&quot; with headquarters at the Las Salinas Naval Base in Viña del Mar. One of its schools, the Naval Seaman Training School, became the Seamen&#x27;s School of the Navy &quot;Captain Alejandro Navarrete Cisterna&quot; in the same year as its centenary, in honor of the first naval seaman to rise through the ranks to become a naval officer. The NSSS soon became the Naval Polytechnic Academy in 1995, through a merger of all its component schools, with some of these schools staying as independent constituent academies.
After the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;etat, together with the Army, the Air Force, and the Carabiniers, the navy, led by Admiral Jose Toribio Merino, became part of the government &quot;junta&quot; led by army commander in chief Augusto Pinochet. Upon the latter&#x27;s resignation from the &quot;junta&quot; leadership in 1981, Adm. Merino became its chairman until March 1990, presiding over its sessions and those of the Legislative Commission. He was also, concurrently, the national defense minister. The training ship &quot;Esmeralda&quot; functioned as a floating prison and torture chamber for political prisoners during the 1973–1980 period of the military dictatorship. It is claimed that probably over a hundred persons were kept there at times and subjected to hideous treatment. It was also an unprecedented period of growth and expansion of the naval service, as more vessels became part of it, the marines strengthened and the navy&#x27;s special forces unit raised.

==Present==
The 25,000-person navy, including 5,200 marines, is directed by Admiral Julio Leiva Molina Martin as of 2017. Of the fleet of 66 surface vessels (soon to be increased to 74), 21 are major combatant ships based in Valparaíso. The navy operates its own aircraft for transport, patrol, and surface and antisubmarine attack. The navy also operates four submarines and a tender ship to support them, all based in Talcahuano.

The navy also provides access to services for residents of Chile&#x27;s Pacific and Southern island regions, thus integrating its disjointed geography. The transport of passengers, especially during the school year or in cases of emergency, together with the supply of provisions and fuel, are of key importance to the inhabitants of these insular zones.

The institution regularly carries out civil operations whereby navy professionals provide social assistance and health care to the civilian population, and provide support in cases of natural catastrophe.

It also undertakes preventive education campaigns for Chile&#x27;s population on issues that include security on beaches and seaside resorts, and measures to be taken in the case of a tsunami.

The most important naval bases and supply depots are (from north to south) in the Pacific Ocean: Iquique, Easter Island, Valparaíso, Talcahuano, Puerto Montt; in the Atlantic zone: Strait of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego: Punta Arenas, in the Beagle Channel, Cape Horn and Drake Passage: Puerto Williams, and in Antarctica: Captain Arturo Prat Base. These are now spread into five naval zones.

==Chilean Marines==
The Chilean Marines or (Infanteria de Marina de Chile) are the land/amphibious attack force of the Chilean Navy. The 5,000 man force combines special training and tactics with state-of-the-art equipment.
==SHOA==
The Servicio Hidrográfico y Oceanográfico de la Armada de Chile (SHOA, Spanish for Hydrological and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy) is an agency of the Chilean Navy managing situations dealing with hydrology and oceanography including tides and tsunamis. SHOA is also the official Chilean government timekeeper.

==Ranks and rates==
Ranks and rates are shown on the sleeves of all Chilean Navy summer uniforms (and on the shoulder boards on winter or summer service uniforms as well for officers and WOs only). Shoulder and sleeve ranks are inspired by those in the British Royal Navy, the French Navy and the German Navy. Officers, WOs and NCOs of the Marines add the &quot;Infante de Marina&quot; (Marine Soldier) title to their ranks from Seaman onward, as the Marines are part of the Navy.

All officers, active or reserve, study at the Arturo Prat Naval Academy and later in the Naval Polytechnic Academy and the Naval War Academy receive improved training and education to be promoted as well as training in his/her specialty field while all active and reserve NCOs (known in the Navy through the general term &quot;Men of the Sea&quot;) study at the Seamen&#x27;s School of the Navy &quot;Alejandro Navarette Cisnerna&quot; and later in the Naval Polytechnic Academy and its attached and independent colleges for later specialty training.

<text>The Navy of the Dominican Republic (), is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Dominican Republic, together with the Army and the Air Force.

==History==
After the Dominican Republic gained its independence from Haiti on February 27, 1844, there was a need to create a naval fleet. Three schooners were commissioned for this, (flagship), &quot;María Chica&quot; and &quot;Leonor&quot;. These were the original three Dominican vessels which were incorporated in the newly created Dominican Navy as authorized by the Junta Central Gubernativa with the Naval Act of 1844 on April 23, 1844, the same day the Navy was created. Even though, the three schooners had been in action since April 15 at the Battle of Tortuguero, where they were led by Admiral Juan Bautista Cambiaso and sank six Haitian ships.

During the Dominican Civil War, a part of the Navy opposed the &quot;Return to the Legitime Government&quot; which was victim of a coup d&#x27;état in September 1963 and used the frigate to bombard the National Palace with the help of the Air Force.

On the other side of the conflict, The elite navy force &quot;Hombres Ranas&quot; (Frog Men) under Commander Ramon Montes Arache, fought to bring the 1962 democratically elected president back in office. The other navy commanders were afraid of the &quot;Hombres Ranas&quot; taking control over Las Calderas Naval Base. &quot;See&quot; United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1965–1966)

==Naval bases==
The Navy maintains several naval stations and detachments, but has three main bases:

* Base Naval 27 de Febrero, located in the city of Santo Domingo, the Chief of Staff and the Naval Academy &quot;Vice-Admiral Cesar de Windt Lavandier&quot;.
* Base Naval de Las Calderas, located in Peravia Province, is the largest naval base. The Bahia Las Calderas Naval Shipyard (ANABALCA) is located here. This shipyard is responsible for the maintenance of naval units of the fleet, as well as civilian vessels. Military and civilian vessels, such as tugs, boats, barges, pilot boats have also been built at this site.
* Base Naval Boca Chica, located in Boca Chica, 35 km east of Santo Domingo.

==List of current vessels==

==Ranks==

===Commissioned officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Dominican Naval Auxiliary Corps==
The Dominican Naval Auxiliary Corps is a civilian force that possesses its own resources to assist in search operations, rescue and environmental protection. This organization was created by the Executive by Decree 887-09 and it is composed of a group of business and professional volunteers.

The organization operates private boats, barges and aircraft made available to the Navy, in order to assist with non-military activities or public order and safety at sea. The Dominican Naval Auxiliary has a presence in the north, northeast, east, south and center of the country.

==Naval Commandos==
The Naval Commandos are the Special Operations component of the Dominican Navy and are only employed in emergency situations. The Naval Commandos are capable of undertaking unconventional warfare, hostage rescue, counter-terrorism, VBSS (Visit Board Search and Seizure) and are experts in handling explosives and amphibious operations. They are also trained in parachuting, hand-to-hand combat, CQC and other key skills. The team&#x27;s armament includes the M16 rifle with the M203 grenade launcher, the Colt M4A1, M14 rifle, Mossberg 500 shotgun, the M60 machine gun and small arms. The team operates inflated zodiac boats, RHIBs, and night vision goggles, among other equipment.

Some team members saw action during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Dominican troops, comprising a battalion of special components of the Dominican Armed forces, were under constant mortar attacks but suffered no casualties. While in Iraq, the troops were serving in the Plus Ultra Brigade, which was under Spanish command and operating in Southern Iraq.

==Marine Infantry Command ==
Raised in 2008 the MIC serves as the youngest arm of service in the Dominican Navy, which is tasked for amphibious and landing operations. One Marine Battalion is of active service as of the present. It is also the youngest Marine unit in all of Latin America.

A large portion of its land is arable, cultivated fields and scattered woodland leading towards the Basingstoke Canal and part of the Eversley/Stratfield Saye/Tylney Park slightly scattered, ancient forest/woodland. These features skirt the north and south of the area, whereas more urban areas skirt the east and, after Old Basing, the west.

==Local government==
Newnham is a civil parish with an elected parish council. The parish is in: Basingstoke and Deane District Council and equally Hampshire County Council. All three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government.

<doc id="1201161" wikidata="Q5519976" url="?curid=1201161" title="Game try">
<text>A game try (also called a game trial bid) in the card game of bridge is a bid that shows interest in bidding a game and asks partner to help in making the decision.

For example, (using Acol or Standard American bidding) if opener, with around 16-17 HCP, bids 1 and partner responds 2 (showing 6 – 9 support points) opener is in a quandary: if responder has a maximum strength hand, with well-positioned high cards, then game will probably make; but the information revealed so far is not accurate enough for either partner to decide whether to play in game or only part score.

Originally, opener would make a game try by bidding 3 (inviting game) and responder would then bid game with maximum (8-9) points or pass with minimum (6-7) points. Modern game try bids permit more accurate decision-making. Following a simple raise by partner (e.g. 1 – 2), opener bids a new suit either to show extra values or to ask responder to show more about his values. There are a variety of methods to do so including &quot;long suit&quot;, &quot;short suit&quot;, or &quot;help suit&quot; game tries and partnership agreement is required.

Whichever method is adopted, responder and opener will collaborate to evaluate the additional information and make one of the following choices: sign off in three of the agreed major; jump to game in the agreed major; jump to game in notrump if the suit is a minor; or make a &quot;counter try&quot; in yet another new suit. When opener has a very strong hand, slam investigation may also be undertaken.

==With a major suit fit==
Prior partnership agreement is needed to determine which variety of game try is being used:
* Long suit game try – After a single raise, opener shows extra values by bidding a second suit naturally at the lowest level (e.g. 1 – 2; 2 or 1 – 2; 3). Responder can promote length and/or high-card values in that suit, or shortness combined with an extra trump, and jump to game. Conversely, responder with weakness in opener&#x27;s second suit should sign off.
* Short suit game try – With this agreement, opener bids a short suit (singleton, void, or perhaps a doubleton) at the lowest level, showing extra values and, by implication, side length in the unbid suits.
* Help suit game try – This agreement is similar to the long suit game try, but slightly more precise. Responder should envision opener holding three small cards in the new suit (although the holding may in fact be better, perhaps as good as KJx). Then, regardless of point count, responder bids game with zero or one loser in that suit and signs off with three losers in that suit. With two losers in that suit, responder bids according to point count.
* Counter try – If responder cannot bid game based on opener&#x27;s game try suit, but has a good holding in a different suit, this can be bid as a counter try provided it can be bid at a level below 3 of the agreed suit, thus 1 – 2; 2 – 3 is allowable but 1 – 2; 3 – 4 is not. This in effect says, &quot;I cannot accept the invitation based on your suit, but if you had asked in this suit, I would have.&quot; Opener can then re-evaluate based on this new information and either sign off or bid game.
* 2NT game try – a less common alternative method is to use the rebid of 2NT as a game try. By agreement, this may be natural, or may be a game try showing solid holdings in the side suits and a weak trump suit, or may have some artificial meaning.
* 2-way / 3-way game try – It is possible to combine long, short and even general strength-based game tries using the following (after 1M-2M): Step 1 = Short suit game try, asking responder to show a singleton, or bid step 1 otherwise, after which opener will show the suit he is short in, with 3M being a surrogate for spades (if hearts agreed) or clubs (if spades agreed). Step 2 = General game try, asking responder to show 6 to 8 points via a step 1 to 3 response, or to bid 3NT with a flat maximum and 4M with any other maximum. Step 3 to 5 = Long (or &#x27;Help&#x27;) suit game tries with 3M (step 5) being a surrogate try in spades (if hearts agreed) or clubs (if spades agreed).

==With a minor suit fit==
Because 11 tricks are required for a minor suit game, most players prefer to investigate the possible optimum contract of 3NT before settling for a minor suit contract (game or part score) and thus a trial bid new suit shows a stopper in that suit for NT purposes, e.g.: 1 – 2; 2 shows game going strength and a stopper in spades

==If opener has a weak hand==
When using any of the above methods of game tries, it is common that a rebid of three of the agreed suit is not a game try, but a preemptive strategy intended to inhibit the opponents from entering the auction. Responder must pass, as in this example: 1 – 2; 3 – Pass.

==If opener has a very strong hand==
If opener has such a good hand that a slam seems possible even following a single raise by partner, then more information about responder&#x27;s hand can be obtained by using a game try bid. If responder rejects the game try, opener can sign off in game. If responder accepts the game try, then opener can further investigate the slam.

==Other methods of &quot;trying&quot; for game==
* Fourth suit forcing (conventional and forcing) – When one of the players (normally responder) can see that game looks likely (25 HCP having been shown by the bidding) but no obvious contract is apparent, bidding the fourth suit can be used to elicit more information from partner. Thus holding: and with this unopposed Acol bidding: 1 – 1; 2 – ? game should be possible but is it 4 (if partner has a 3-card spade suit, yes) or 4 (if partner has a 6-card heart suit, yes) or 3NT (if partner has A10x in diamonds, yes)? Bidding the fourth suit (1 – 1; 2 – 2; ?) asks partner to give new, useful information to clarify the situation.
* Invitational bids (natural limit bids, non-forcing) – Either as part of, or following, suit agreement, bids at a level one below game are generally considered to be invitational, thus in Acol: 1 – 2; 3 – ? and 1 – 3; ? are both invitational to a 4 game contract. The invitation should be accepted (game should be bid) with maximum points and declined (by passing) with minimum. For suit contracts this method has largely been supplanted by game try bids as above. However, it is still widely used for NT contracts, thus 1NT – 2NT is invitational to bid game in 3NT
* Stayman convention – At its simplest a 2 response is used following an opening bid of 1NT to enquire whether opener has a 4-card major suit. Depending on the answer, responder will pick the best game contract.
*Long suit game tries -- This may also be known as &#x27;help suit game try&#x27;. In practice, Where the length or strength of major potential contract suit is in doubt, this convention is an attempt to determine whether a secondary suit fit may be enough to proceed to game.

<text>Russell S. Doughten Jr. (February 16, 1927 – August 19, 2013) was an American filmmaker and producer of numerous short and feature-length films. His film work is credited under numerous variations of his name: with or without the &quot;Jr.&quot; suffix or middle initial, and sometimes using the informal &quot;Russ&quot; instead of &quot;Russell&quot;. 

Doughten made both secular and Christian films. His work included the 1958 science fiction classic &quot;The Blob&quot;. He was best known for his four-part series &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot;. Nearly all of his Christian films were shot in various locales in his home state of Iowa.

He has been referred to as &quot;the godfather of independent film in Iowa&quot; and his body of work ranks him as the leading filmmaker in that state. He mentored many indie filmmakers in Iowa.

== Early life ==
Russell Doughten, Jr. was born February 16, 1927, on the way to the hospital in Iowa Falls, Iowa. His father was a rural mail carrier. Although Doughten grew up going to church, he notes that he was baptized three times before he was &quot;born again&quot;. After living in several small Iowa towns, Doughten graduated from Chester High School.

As soon as Doughten reached enlistment age, he enlisted in the Navy. At one point, he was stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes. He was honorably discharged in 1946.

Doughten was active in the Methodist Church and served in youth ministry and boys&#x27; camps as a recreational director and swimming instructor.

After his discharge from the Navy, Doughten attended Drake University on an athletic scholarship, but he became more interested in studying drama. After completing a fine arts degree at Drake in 1949, he began teaching English and drama in Williamsburg, Iowa in 1950.

Doughten married Gertrude Spraugue June 2, 1950 in Evanston, Illinois, while Doughten was performing summer stock in Chicago. He had met Gertrude while attending Drake.

He left teaching high school in Iowa to study drama at Yale University.

==Career==
After completing graduate studies at Yale, while still living on the East Coast, he began working for Good News Productions in Pennsylvania as a producer, director, editor, and writer. With Good News, he produced feature films, a children&#x27;s gospel hour, and a Salvation Army recruiting film.

Good News Productions partnered with Jack H. Harris and Valley Forge Films to make the 1958 sci-fi classic, &quot;The Blob&quot;. Doughten worked as Associate Producer on the film.

In 1958, Doughten returned to teaching English and drama, as well as supervising and directing student productions at South Pasadena High School in California. His former students report that he was exacting in demanding their best efforts, but they were proud of the results and the quality of the productions he directed. 

=== Launch of Heartland Productions ===
In 1964, he resigned from teaching in California. Having become disillusioned with Hollywood, Doughten returned to Des Moines, initially planning to produce a film called &quot;Heartland&quot; about an Iowa farm family. He started his first production company, Heartland Productions, in 1965. He formed Heartland to make quality, low-budget films, stating that, &quot;there are two ways of making movies these days, either expensive blockbusters or low-budget pictures. Since we obviously could not make &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, the low-budgeters seemed the answer.&quot; Heartland concentrated on good stories rather than star quality actors.

His first movie with Heartland, &quot;The Hostage&quot; (1966), was the first feature length movie made entirely in Iowa. Doughten employed about 100 Iowans as either extras or in technical slots. The film premiered in Des Moines October 26, 1966. The film was distributed by Crown International Pictures.

Doughten followed up with &quot;Fever Heat&quot; in 1968. Doughten directed the film and produced it under the Heartland label. A story about the excitement of stock car racing, &quot;Fever Heat&quot; follows a big-time driver who gets into small-town dirt track racing. The film was shot in Dexter, Iowa, using the Stuart Speedway. The production company converted a former boat factory in Dexter into a soundstage used for interior scenes in the film. Doughten had planned to film the entire picture in three weeks, but heavy rain right before filming started turned the dirt speedway to mud. Doughten changed the film schedule to shoot interior scenes until races could resume on the dirt track. Doughten used 40 De Moines area Iowans as extras and three local race drivers. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures.

Although Doughten would eventually produce a total of eight feature films through Heartland, the first two films had lost money, forcing Doughten to take out an SBA loan. The terms of the load prohibited him from making movies, so the company shifted to acquiring and managing theaters.

=== &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; ===
In 1972, Doughten launched Mark IV Productions in partnership with co-founder Donald W. Thompson. They would produce 12 feature-length Christian films over a 12-year period, including the films that Doughten is best known for, the &quot;Thief In The Night&quot; series. The series dramatizes the Rapture and Tribulation and the struggles of a small band of believers against an increasingly hostile worldwide Antichrist dictatorship. The tetrad included &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; (1972), &quot;A Distant Thunder&quot; (1978), &quot;Image of the Beast&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Prodigal Planet&quot; (1983).

Doughten appears in all four films as Reverend Matthew Turner, a survivalist who has an elaborate chart of the End Times events, but did not fully believe in the Bible until after the Rapture, even if not accepting Christ as his savior. With his long, graying hair usually worn in a ponytail and shaggy beard, he didn&#x27;t look the part of the stereotypical Christian fundamentalist, a fact that is credited with earning him secular fans, as is his use of unusual camera angles and layered audio.

While there had been feature-length Christian films before, including the End Times film &quot;If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?&quot; directed by Ron Ormond in 1971, a sweeping, ambitious project like &quot;Thief&quot;—with three sequels telling one continuous story over the course of a decade—had never been undertaken even in Hollywood. Doughten&#x27;s identification of the Antichrist not with Communism as Ormond had done, nor with Jack Chick&#x27;s sinister view of the Vatican, but rather with a worldwide government that initially acts as a global peacemaker, i.e. the United Nations, is consistent with many other Biblical interpretations of the Tribulation.

While the films were clearly made on a low budget, and the dated 1970s fashions shown in the early films provide unintentional amusement today, there is no denying the series&#x27; influence among Christian fundamentalists. &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot; is said to be the most widely seen gospel film in the world and has been influential in many conversions to Christianity. Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins cite Doughten&#x27;s films as being the primary influence for their million selling &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of books and films. Doughten&#x27;s films have been frequently shown in churches and on Christian television stations.

==Later years==
Doughten continued to produce films through Heartland Productions even during the time the &quot;Thief&quot; franchise was continuing. Some of his later credits through Heartland were &quot;Sammy&quot; (1977), &quot;Nite Song&quot; (1978), &quot;Whitcomb&#x27;s War&quot; (1980), and &quot;Face in the Mirror&quot; (1988).

The volume of work Doughten produced through Heartland Productions, Mark IV Productions, and Russell Doughten Productions ranks him as the leading filmmaker in the history of Iowa.

In 2001, Doughten was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the WYSIWYG Film Festival, and the National Religious Broadcasters Association presented him the &quot;Milestone Award&quot; for 50 years of achievement in presenting the gospel through film.

Casting agent Kimberly Busbee referred to Doughen as &quot;the godfather of independent film in Iowa.&quot; He was a regular attendee at Iowa&#x27;s Wild Rose Independent Film Festival, and had mentored many indie filmmakers in Iowa.

Doughten died from a cardiac-related illness on August 19, 2013.

<doc id="1201164" wikidata="Q547013" url="?curid=1201164" title="Tours Cathedral">
<text>Tours Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic church located in Tours, Indre-et-Loire, France, and dedicated to Saint Gatianus. It is the seat of the Archbishops of Tours, the metropolitan cathedral of the Tours ecclesiastical province. It was built between 1170 and 1547. At the time construction began, the church was located at the south end of the bridge over the river Loire, on the road from Paris to the south-west of France. It has been a classified since 1862. Since 1905 it has been owned by the French State, with the Catholic Church having the exclusive rights of use.

==History==
Three earlier cathedrals existed on the same site. The first, dedicated to Saint Maurice, was built by Bishop Lidorius from 337 to 371. It burned in 558, and was rebuilt by the Bishop Gregory of Tours and rededicated it in 590. Its location, at the south-west angle of the &quot;castrum&quot;, or old Roman walls, resulted in the cathedral entrance being part of the old Roman city wall. Beginning in about 1160 another structure was begun, in the Angevin style. It was badly damaged by a fire, and never finished.

The work recommenced with the choir in about 1220, and received financial assistance in from Louis IX, or Saint Louis. The choir and transept were rebuilt between 1240 and the beginning of the 14th century, using portions of the lower walls of the Romanesque structure. The lower portions were largely in the early Gothic style, the upper walls in the later Rayonnant style. At the end of the 14th century, the transept was completed. In 1356, the cathedral was re-dedicated to Saint Gatianus.
Further work and the construction of the towers was interrupted by the Hundred Years War (1337–1453). The nave was only finished during the 15th century by architects Jean de Dammartin, Jean Papin and Jean Durand. with financial assistance from Charles VII and the Duke of Brittany Jean V. In 1484 the lower portals were completed. The two new towers were erected just outside of the old city walls. The late-Roman surrounding wall is visible in cross section at the rear of the towers from the north. The first tower was finished in 1534 and the second in 1547, with French Renaissance features in their crowns.

The very slow construction of the cathedral led to a local saying: &quot;... not until the cathedral is finished&quot;, to mean something particularly long and difficult to achieve. It also meant that the building presents a complex pattern of French religious types of architecture from the 13th century to the 16th.

In 1787, responding to Vatican doctrines calling for making interiors of churches more open and welcoming, the jubé, or choir screen, which separated the choir from the nave, was removed. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the Jacobins smashed the statues on the church portal. The church was nationalised and transformed into a Temple of Reason, until the reign of Napoleon I. In 1848, portions of the cathedral, including the portal sculpture, were restored.

A major restoration of the cathedral began in 1993. The organ restoration was completed in 1996, and began of the upper windows, Between 2010 and 2013 the restoration of the north transept and is rose window was completed, restored, and two hundred square meters of new windows, dedicated to Saint Martin, were added to cathedral. A new main altar was dedicated in 2018.

== Architecture ==
===Exterior – west front ===
The west front of the cathedral displays three very different styles of architecture harmoniously combined. The lower walls of the towers and the central block of the facade up to the triangular fronton date were built in sober Romanesque style, then, along with the buttresses, were covered with much more ornate and dense Flamboyant decoration.

== Transepts and chevet ==

The sides of the cathedral are reinforced with massive flying buttresses, capped with spires to give them additional weight. The chevet of the cathedral, at the east end, is very unusual along Gothic cathedrals in not having any other structures attached to it.

The north transept of the cathedral is unusual in that it has two additional buttresses to support the north front, with its rose window. The rose window also has an unusual bar attached to its face to give it additional strength.

== Towers ==
The two towers have heights of 69 and 70 meters. Portions of the bases of the towers date to the 12th century, The faces of the towers are covered with very elaborate tracery and decoration in the later Flamboyant style. The top sections of the two towers, which completed the structures, with heights of 69 and 70 meters, are early examples of French Renaissance architecture.

== Interior == 
The nave has the traditional three levels; a gallery on the ground floor with large pillars supporting the ribs of the vaulted ceiling; a mid-level gallery, or triforium, with windows; and an upper level, or clerestory, with tall windows filling the upper walls with glass. The nave has a height of 29 meters, but a width less than many cathedrals, probably due to the re-use of an earlier Romanesque foundation. The vaults are covered with the original roof structure, built of wooden beams from the 13th century in the choir, and from the 15th century in the nave.

The choir still has its original fifteen 13th-century windows, which feature both scenes of the lives of Christ, Apostles and Saints, as well as windows which depict the professions of the guilds which contributed to the financing of the windows. The rose window in the north transept, built in the early 14th century, has an unusual design. It was placed into the center of a square already filled with stained glass. This later caused difficulties of stability; a buttress had to be built in the interior, across the middle of the window, which divides it into two. The window is also supported by flying buttresses on the outside.

The south transept also has a rose window, and contains the original case of the 16th century organ, It was donated by Martin de Beaune, and built by Barnabé Delanoue. It now contains an 18th-century organ built by Cliquot.

== Art and decoration ==

The nave contains a monumental tomb, that of the two children of King Charles VIII of France and Anne of Brittany, who died as infants. It was made in 1506 by Guillaume Regnault or Girolamo da Fiesole, and originally was located in the church of St. Martin, and was moved to the cathedral after the French Revolution. The tomb is made of Carrara marble, in the Italian style. The recumbent statues are reminiscent of the 15th-century French medieval tradition (school of Michel Colombe).

==Stained glass ==

In the 13th century, the artists working on Tours Cathedral launched a small revolution in the design of stained glass windows. Instead of having the entire window filled a multitude of small scenes made of tiny pieces of deeply-coloured glass, the Tours artists began making windows with a mixture of types of glass; the traditional iconographic scenes with Biblical figures were surrounded by panes of clear or lightly coloured glass decorated with ornamental and vegetal themes. This served the purpose of bringing a much greater quantity of light into the interior, and also highlighted the chosen subjects, which otherwise were lost among hundreds of other images. This style of window, introduced at Tours in about 1265, was soon followed at Troyes Cathedral, and then spread quickly to other cathedrals in France and then England.

This revolution in the format of display was accompanied by an even more important revolution in technique, with the use of silver stain, a method for painting onto glass with enamel paints, which were then heated and fused onto the glass. This allowed the more expressive figures, shading and three-dimensions, closer to paintings than to mosaics. The sizes of the pieces of glass became larger, and the amount of lead bars in the window smaller. The figures in stained glass windows began to resemble those in medieval miniature paintings in realism.

===Rose windows===

The cathedral has three rose windows in the west front and the two ends of the transept. The most original is that of the north transept, installed in the beginning of the 14th century. The rose was installed in a square section of window already filled with glass. where the rose was installed, problems of stability appeared, and it had to be reinforced by a vertical stone bar behind the window, dividing it in two, and by additional buttresses on the exterior.

==Pipe organ==

The pipe organ is located in the south transept. The case and decoration date to the 16th century. The instrument now in place was made in the 18th century by the family firm founded by Robert Clicquot.

==Bells==
The cathedral has four major bells located in the south tower. The bourdon, the largest and deepest-sounding, is Christus, made in 1749 and weighing 1,850 kilograms. It originally hung in the nearby Abbey of St. Paul in Cormery. In 1793, during the Revolution, most church bells were seized and melted down to make cannon and other armament. Towns were allowed to have only a single bell to warn of a fire. The inhabitants of Coermery resisted and rolled the bell to another town to preserve it. Finally, in 1807, it was taken to Tours and installed in the tower.

The other three bells are:
:Maurice (1350 kilos, 1864); 
:Gatien (980 kilos, 1884);
:Maur (1250 kilos, 14th century).

==The Cloister of La Psalette and the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace ==
To the north of the cathedral is a small cloister, built during the Renaissance, known as the &quot;cloître de la Psalette&quot;, in reference to its function as a school where the chanting of psalms was taught. It was built between 1442 and 1524. It has three galleries, placed against the north wall of the cathedral. It also has a scriptorium, where manuscripts were created, which was built in 1520, and is served by a stairway; and a library with a vaulted ceiling, where several frescoes from the 13th and 14th centuries can be seen. This was an early appearance of the French Renaissance style, which had recently been introduced in the stairway the Chateau of Blois in the nearby Loire Valley.

To the south of the cathedral is the former archbishop&#x27;s palace, built in the early 18th century, which has now become the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Tours. It also was originally built against the GaLLO-Roman city wall of the 4th century. It contains one hall from the 11th century, and another from the 12th century. On the wall of the second hall is a balcony from which the judgements of the ecclesiastical court were announced.

<text>James Smith (September 17, 1719 – July 11, 1806), a Founding Father of the United States, was an Irish/American lawyer and a signer to the United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Pennsylvania.

He was born in Ireland; his family immigrated to Chester County, Pennsylvania, in 1729. Smith attended the Philadelphia Academy. He studied law at the office of his brother George and was admitted to the bar in Pennsylvania, initially practicing near Shippensburg and later near York. He became captain of the militia there. He was appointed to the provincial convention in Philadelphia in 1775, to the state constitutional convention in 1776, and was elected to the Continental Congress, where he signed the Declaration of Independence. He was reelected to Congress in 1785 but declined to attend because of his advanced age.

Smith died on July 11, 1806, and is buried in York, Pennsylvania, First Presbyterian Churchyard. The University of Delaware has a dormitory on its North Campus bearing his name.

<doc id="1201171" wikidata="Q4893101" url="?curid=1201171" title="Bernard Epton">
<text>Bernard Edward Epton (August 25, 1921 – December 13, 1987) was an American politician who served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1969 to 1983. He was a candidate for the Republican nominee in the close and contentious Chicago mayoral election of 1983.

== Early life and education ==
Epton grew up in the South Shore neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. He graduated from O&#x27;Keefe Grammar School and Hyde Park High School. He later attended Woodrow Wilson Junior College and the University of Chicago. During his college years, Epton was active in the South Shore Chamber of Commerce and, in 1940, spoke on behalf of the Chamber&#x27;s president, J. Leslie Rosenblum, about youth involvement in politics at a town hall meeting. This event was coordinated with the national radio broadcast &quot;Is Youth Doing Its Share?&quot; produced by America&#x27;s Town Meeting of the Air.

== Military service ==
Epton served as a 2nd lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II, eventually reaching the rank of Captain. He was part of the Eighth Air Force, which conducted a strategic bombing campaign over Nazi-occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. Epton flew one mission with the 95th Bomb Group as a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress navigator with the 335th Bombardment Squadron. He completed 23 missions with the 571st Bombardment Squadron in the 390th Bombardment Group as a &quot;Mickey Operator,&quot; managing the H2X radar platform on the B-17G Flying Fortress for blind bombing operations. He returned home decorated with two Distinguished Flying Crosses, four Air Medals, five battle stars for the European Theater, and a personal citation from General Doolittle and also commended by General Kessler.

==Legal and political career ==
After the war, Epton graduated from DePaul University College of Law and became a successful attorney specializing in insurance law. He became a partner of a firm alongside his brother, Saul A. Epton and attorney James E. Dwork. His brother Saul would later become a Cook County judge in 1959 and was a close friend of Gov. George Ryan. In 1947, Bernard was part the Draft Eisenhower movement and co-founded a non-profit with Joseph A. Moller, an executive at Pure Oil Co. and a World War II pilot and veteran, and Harry G. Johnson. Their objective was to gather campaign funds for Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, to contest the presidency of the United States. During this time Epton was president of the Illinois Republican Veterans League which started after World War I and they had collected 3,500 signatures and $16,000 in donations as campaign funds. After Eisenhower announced he wouldn&#x27;t run for the 1948 presidential election, their non-profit returned the funds back to the contributors.

Later in 1948, Epton served as the campaign manager for Harry S. Ditchburne, a candidate for state&#x27;s attorney. They received an endorsement from Nicholas J. Bohling, the South Shore alderman for Chicago&#x27;s 7th Ward. Bohling, who later become a Cook County circuit judge, held the alderman position from 1943 to 1971, believed to be the longest tenure for a Republican in the Chicago City Council. In 1949, he was elected to the board of governors of the State of Illinois Young Republican organizations and represented the Second Congressional district.

Bernard&#x27;s first attempt to run for Illinois&#x27;s 2nd congressional district was in 1950 Republican primary, but he lost the primary to Richard B. Vail who went on to beat Barratt O&#x27;Hara and win the election to represent the district in the Eighty-second Congress (January 3, 1951 – January 3, 1953). During the primary race Vail accused Epton of being a Republican &quot;rebel&quot; who subscribed to New Deal theories and tactics. Also, Vail accused Epton that he didn&#x27;t return the donations he received in 1948 for Eisenhower&#x27;s presidency. In turn Epton then filed a $500,000 libel suit against Vail and his campaign manager Ambrose P. Finn for making false accusations regarding the funds. During these years he continued work as a lawyer and was an active member of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Jewish War Veterans. In 1960, Bernard as a liberal Republican candidate for U.S. Representative from Illinois&#x27; 2nd congressional district but lost to the Democratic incumbent, Barratt O&#x27;Hara, during the same year John F. Kennedy narrowly won Illinois. Known for his wit and occasionally sharp tongue, Epton was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1969, where he served until 1983. During his tenure, he chaired the chamber&#x27;s Insurance Committee.

==Chicago mayoral election of 1983==

A resident of the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Epton ran against the liberal African American Democrat Harold Washington in the mayoral election in the spring of 1983. In a racially charged election, Epton came within 40,000 votes (of 1.2 million cast) of defeating the Democratic nominee. His total was the high-water mark for Chicago Republicans in elections for mayor in the heavily Democratic city. Epton received 81 percent of the votes of Chicago whites, and 3 percent from blacks.

If elected, Epton would have been the city&#x27;s first Jewish mayor (an accomplishment that eventually was claimed by Rahm Emanuel when he was elected in 2011) and its first Republican mayor since William Hale Thompson left office in 1931.

==Later life and death==
After being defeated by Washington, Epton briefly returned to private life.

Epton tried seeking the Republican nomination for mayor again in 1987 mayoral election, but failed to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot.

Four years after the 1983 mayoral election (and fewer than three weeks after Mayor Washington died suddenly of a heart attack) Epton himself suffered a coronary and died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the age of sixty-six on December 13, 1987. Epton was there visiting his son Jeffrey David &quot;Jeff&quot; Epton (born c. 1947), a socialist member of the Ann Arbor City Council and long-time critic of capital punishment.

<text>James Smith VC (1871 – 18 March 1946) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Smith was about 26 years old, and a corporal in The Buffs (East Kent Regiment), British Army during the First Mohmand Campaign, British India when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On the night of 16/17 September 1897, in the Mamund Valley, North-West India, Corporal Smith, with other men, responded to a call for volunteers and followed two officers of the Royal Engineers (James Morris Colquhoun Colvin and Thomas Colclough Watson) into the burning village of Bilot, driving off the enemy with the bayonet. Afterwards, although wounded, Corporal Smith continued, firing steadily and coolly, and also helped to carry the wounded to the place prepared for them. When Lieutenant Watson left, in order to fetch assistance for the wounded, Corporal Smith held the position till that Officer&#x27;s return, exposing his life freely in watching the enemy and directing the fire of his men.

For their parts in the action, Lieutenants Watson and Colvin also received the VC.

Smith later achieved the rank of colour-sergeant. He is buried in Watling Street Cemetery in Dartford, Kent.

His Victoria Cross was on display at The Buffs Regimental Museum, Canterbury, England. With the rest of that museum&#x27;s collection, it has now been transferred to the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London.

<doc id="1201184" wikidata="Q16275924" url="?curid=1201184" title="Gashouse Gang">
<text>The Gashouse Gang was the nickname of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team that dominated the National League from the late 1920s to the early 1930s. Owing to their success that started in 1926, the Cardinals would win a total of five National League pennants from 1926 to 1934 (nine seasons) while winning three World Series championships (1926, 1931, 1934).

==Background==
The team started out in Major League Baseball as a member of the American Association as the Brown Stockings; they won four straight AA pennants before moving to the National League in 1892. St. Louis struggled through three decades of mediocrity, which saw them finish above fourth place just six times that matched the number of times they finished below ninth. The Cardinals, owned by Sam Breadon with Branch Rickey as general manager and Rogers Hornsby as player-turned-manager, would see their cultivation of talent pay off in 1926. Flint Rhem was their only twenty game winner, while Bob O&#x27;Farrell was the National League MVP and Jim Bottomley drove in the most runs for a team that scored the most runs in the league as they narrowly beat the Cincinnati Reds by two games with a 89–65 record to win the pennant. It was their first pennant since 1888. In the 1926 World Series, the Cardinals faced the New York Yankees. After winning two of the first three games, the Yankees roared back in the next two games to put them on the ropes for Game 6 and 7, which the Cardinals won in New York to win their first championship. The next year&#x27;s team won three more games but fell short of the pennant by 1.5 games. However, the 1928 team won the league pennant with 95 victories, with Bottomley winning the MVP Award once again as the Cardinals narrowly beat the New York Giants by two games with Bill McKechnie now as manager. In the 1928 World Series, they met the Yankees again but lost in a straight sweep. The 1929 season saw three different managers in McKechnie, Gabby Street, and Billy Southworth (who had played for the Cardinals for the last three seasons of his career) as they went 78–74. Street would be retained as manager for the 1930 season.

==Overview==
The nickname Gashouse Gang, by most accounts, came from the team&#x27;s generally very shabby appearance and rough-and-tumble tactics. An opponent once stated the Cardinals players usually went into the field in unwashed, dirty, and smelly uniforms, which alone spread horror among their rivals. According to one account, shortstop Leo Durocher coined the term. He and his teammates were speaking derisively of the American League, and the consensus was that the Redbirds—should they prevail in the National League race—would handle whoever won the American League pennant. &quot;Why, they wouldn&#x27;t even let us in that league over there&quot;, Durocher, who had played for the New York Yankees, observed. &quot;They think we&#x27;re just a bunch of gashousers.&quot; The phrase &quot;gas house&quot; referred to factories that turned coal into town gas for lighting and cooking. Common in U.S. cities until the widespread use of natural gas, the plants were noted for their foul smell and were typically located near railroad yards in the poorest neighborhood in the city. Another explanation holds that the name comes from Dizzy Dean, who played at City Park (renamed McKechnie Field in 1962), in Bradenton, Florida, for spring training in the 1930s. The story goes that Dean liked the city so much, he bought a local gas station and hung out there when he wasn&#x27;t playing.

The team was led by general manager Branch Rickey, playing manager Frankie Frisch and included other stars such as Joe Medwick and Ripper Collins. Many of the players on the Cardinals roster, including the Dean brothers, Bill DeLancey, Pepper Martin, Spud Davis, and Burgess Whitehead, were Southerners or Southwesterners from working-class backgrounds.

The 1930 Cardinals won 92 games. Every player on the 1930 team with 300 or more at-bats hit a batting average of .300 or higher, which was the first and only time in baseball history. They won the pennant by two games, and faced the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. In the 1930 World Series, the Cardinals, a high-scoring offense, could only score more than three runs once in the Series, which they lost in six games.

The 1934 team featured five regulars who hit at least .300, a 30-game winner in Dizzy Dean (the last National League pitcher to win 30 games in a single season, and the last pitcher in Major League Baseball to do so until Denny McLain accomplished the feat for the Detroit Tigers), and four All-Stars, including player-manager Frisch. Not among the All-Stars was Collins, the first baseman who led the team in sixteen offensive categories with stats like a .333 batting average, a .615 slugging percentage, 35 home runs, and 128 runs batted in. The following year was historic for the Cardinals, as they went 101–53 for their first 100-win season ever, winning the pennant by thirteen games, with Bill Hallahan saving Game 7 to beat Philadelphia. The two following seasons saw them finish sixth and fifth before Street was replaced by Frankie Frisch midway through the 1933 season. The 1934 team would receive the nickname that stuck that year, which saw Dizzy Dean won thirty games to go alongside player-manager Frisch and other perennial stars. In the 1934 World Series, the Cards and Tigers split the first two games in Detroit, and the Tigers took two of the next three in St. Louis. St. Louis proceeded to win the next two, including an 11–0 embarrassment of the Tigers in Detroit to win the Series. The stars for the Cards were Medwick, who had a .379 batting average with one of St. Louis&#x27;s two home runs and a series-high five RBI, and the Dean Brothers, who combined for all four of the team&#x27;s wins with 28 strikeouts and a 1.43 earned run average.

==Aftermath and legacy==
While the next couple of years would see the Cardinals play well to their competition, they finished 2nd place four times in the next seven seasons with no pennants. It was a new generation of players alongside the return of Southworth as manager in 1940 that saw the Cardinals rise back up to champions, as they won three World Series titles in five seasons from 1942 to 1946. From the teams of 1926 to 1934, fourteen total individuals who played or managed the Cardinals would receive induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum: Rogers Hornsby, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Jim Bottomley, Chick Hafey, Jesse Haines, Billy Southworth, Dizzy Dean, Leo Durocher, Frankie Frisch, Joe Medwick, Dazzy Vance, Bill McKechnie, Rabbit Maranville, and Burleigh Grimes. 

==In popular culture==
* Several Cardinal players participated in the informal &quot;Mudcat Band.&quot; Lon Warneke played guitar and sang, Pepper Martin played harmonica and guitar, Bill McGee played a fiddle, Bob Weiland blew into a jug, and outfielder Frenchy Bordagaray &quot;played a contraption that included a washboard, a car horn, a whistle, and an electric light.&quot; The band wore variants of the Cardinal uniform (with &quot;Mudcats&quot; replacing &quot;Cardinals&quot; on the birds-on-the-bat logo) and played gigs around the Midwest and South on off-days and during the off-season.
*In &quot;Goliath&quot; season 2 episode 3 &quot;Yeah, well, I like to think that we&#x27;re the Gashouse Gang, – so fuck the Yankees.&quot;
*One of the teams in the 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Baseball Bugs&quot; was the &quot;Gashouse Gorillas&quot;.
*Country-bluegrass band Old Crow Medicine Show refers to them in the song &quot;Caroline&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;Tennessee Pusher&quot;.
*In the 1938 George Cukor remake of the 1930 Romantic comedy film &quot;Holiday&quot;, starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, Professor Potter (played by Edward Everett Horton) and his wife (played by Jean Dixon) enter a sophisticated and pompous New Year&#x27;s Eve Party where they feel uncomfortably under dressed and out of place. They escape to the fourth floor where they hear simple music coming from Hepburn&#x27;s room, and Professor Potter happily says, &quot;It&#x27;s the Gashouse Gang, darling.&quot;
*In 2015, author Carolyn E. Mueller and illustrator Ed Koehler, in association with Reedy Press, LLC published an illustrated book titled &quot;Dizzy Dean and the Gashouse Gang.&quot; () The book showcases the antics of Dizzy and his brother Paul Dean, Joe Medwick, Pepper Martin, player/manager Frankie Frisch, and the 1934 St. Louis Cardinals season in their quest to win their third World Series.

<doc id="1201190" wikidata="Q5444584" url="?curid=1201190" title="Fernando Alvarez (economist)">
<text>Fernando Enrique Alvarez (born 1964) is an Argentine macroeconomist. He is professor of economics at the University of Chicago. He received his B.A. in Economics at Universidad Nacional de La Plata in 1989 and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 2008. He was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2018.

Fernando Alvarez&#x27;s most influential contribution seems to be his work with Urban Jermann (Wharton) on endogenously incomplete markets. They show how the limited commitment model of Timothy Kehoe and David Levine and also of Narayana Kocherlakota can be decentralized with certain borrowing constraints. They also showed how this model could explain some feature of asset prices, such as the equity premium. Several papers have used their model later on to explain other macroeconomic phenomena.

Fernando Alvarez has also presented a new estimate of the welfare cost of business cycles, which is based on observed asset prices (with Urban Jermann). His other work includes models of monetary economies with segmented markets and search models with incomplete markets.

<text>Dianne Gladys Hadden (born 4 October 1951) is an Australian politician. She was an independent member of the Victorian Legislative Council since April 2004, after resigning from the Labor Party, which she previously represented in the council for Ballarat Province since 1999. 
She attempted to switch to the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the 2006 election, contesting the electorate of Ballarat East, but gained less than 7% of the vote.

Hadden was born in Ivanhoe, Melbourne, and studied economics and law at Monash University. She worked for law firms in Melbourne and Ballarat, before founding her own practice in Ballarat in 1992.

In the leadup to the 1999 state election, Hadden succeeded in securing Labor pre-selection for the Liberal-held seat of Ballarat Province. She was ultimately successful, defeating new Liberal candidate, David Clark. Though she has never occupied a ministerial position, Hadden has been a member of the Law Reform Committee since her election to parliament, and in 2003, also joined the House Committee.

Hadden has gained a reputation as something of a political maverick, having publicly attacked her own party on several issues. She came out strongly against controversial plans to build a toxic waste dump at Pittong, near Ballarat, and tabling a petition opposing the proposal in parliament. When Premier Steve Bracks continued to push for the dump to be sited at Pittong, despite significant negative publicity, she publicly slammed the government, labelling them &quot;arrogant and dogmatic&quot;, and comparing them to former Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett - though this earned a stern rebuke from Bracks. The campaign was ultimately successful, but it cemented her falling out with the party, resulting in her resignation to become an independent in April 2004. She attempted unsuccessfully to switch to the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Ballarat East at the 2006 election, but came fourth, gaining 6.61% of the vote and allowing long-time rival Geoff Howard to win easily.

Hadden has been a sharp critic of genetically modified crops and her government&#x27;s policies on the issue, and has publicly pushed for a harder stance. She also attacked the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and was among ten Victorian Labor MPs who signed a petition declaring their opposition to the war. She is a member of a number of community organisations, including Amnesty International, the Fred Hollows Foundation and the National Trust of Australia.

<text>East Pakistan Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) was a communist party in the erstwhile East Pakistan. The party emerged in 1966, after a split in the Communist Party of East Pakistan. Sukhendu Dastidar became the general secretary of EPCP(M-L).
==Bangladesh Liberation War and aftermath==
In 1971, Mohammad Toaha and Abdul Haq refused to participate for the independence of Bangladesh. After the war two separate EPCP(M-L)s were formed, one led by Toaha&#x27;s EPCP(M-L) which evolved into the Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist) and the other led by Abdul Haq. Mohammad Toaha&#x27;s party denounced Charu Majumdar&#x27;s ideology of class annihilation.

In 1978 Haque&#x27;s party took the name Revolutionary Communist Party of Bangladesh (Marxist-Leninist).

<text>Forest Hill is a neighborhood in the city of Newark in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a pre-World War II neighborhood in the North Ward. It is bounded on the west by Branch Brook Park, on the south by Bloomfield Avenue (some maps place the southern limit at 2nd Avenue), and on the east by both Summer and Mt. Prospect Avenues, the neighborhood of Broadway. The neighborhood&#x27;s ZIP Code is 07104.

Forest Hill is located on a ridge between the Passaic River and the valley of the Branch Brook. It was first developed by Elias Heller, who owned a file factory in North Newark, on the Belleville border. Heller Parkway is named in his honor. From the 1870s to the 1920s, generations of wealthy Newarkers built hundreds of stately homes in the area in various styles, including Beaux-Arts, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Gothic Revival, and Spanish Revival. One such house is the Wright-Clark house, a Tudor style manor built during the early 1900s. Along with their mansions, the wealthy of Forest Hill also developed scores of social and literary clubs. Other than the homes, landmarks include the old Tiffany factory and the Ballantine Gate. The North End branch and the Branch Brook Park branch of the Newark Public Library serve the neighborhood.

The neighborhood is well preserved and maintained, and few of the historic homes have been torn down, renovated into apartments, or transferred to institutional use. The northern part of the neighborhood is part of an official historic district, containing a marker that was erected by The Newark Preservation and Landmarks Committee, a non-profit organization dedicated to the care of Newark&#x27;s past history. During special times throughout the year, there are special tours made possible by several organizations such as the New Jersey Historical Society where homeowners open their homes to visitors, and the Mount Pleasant Cemetery Association. Working alongside the neighborhood, the Forest Hill Community Association provides assistance by offering a chance to volunteer, and hosting various events of engagement. This area also includes a diverse community, standing out for its calm environment.

The Sydenham House located on &quot;The Old Road to Bloomfield&quot; (east of Branch Brook Park) and built in 1712 is the city&#x27;s oldest private residence. It was later expanded in the early 19th Century. D.J. and Elizabeth Henderson restored it in the 1950s.

==Transportation==

The Bloomfield Avenue, Davenport Avenue and Branch Brook Park stations of the Newark Light Rail system are all located nearby.

==Notable people==

Notable current and former residents of Forest Hill include:
* Robert Altenkirch, President of the University of Alabama in Huntsville.
* Peter Ballantine (1791–1883), founder of Newark&#x27;s Patterson &amp; Ballantine Brewing Company in 1840.
* Dean Faiello (born 1959), non-doctor convicted of killing a patient during a medical procedure.
* Maria Jeritza (1887–1982), opera singer.
* Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933), artist and designer best known for his work in stained glass.
* William Hayes Ward (1835–1916) clergyman, editor of The Independent, a leading Abolitionist newspaper.

<doc id="1201218" wikidata="Q3699925" url="?curid=1201218" title="Cyril Ritchard">
<text>Cyril Joseph Trimnell-Ritchard (1 December 1898 – 18 December 1977), known professionally as Cyril Ritchard, was an Australian stage, screen and television actor, and director. He is best remembered today for his performance as Captain Hook in the Mary Martin musical production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. In 1945, he played Gabriele Eisenstein in &quot;Gay Rosalinda&quot; at the Palace theatre in London, a version of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; by Erich Wolfgang Korngold in which he appeared with Peter Graves. The show was conducted by Richard Tauber and ran for almost a year.

==Life and career==

Ritchard was born in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills, one of five siblings born to Sydney-born parents: Herbert Trimnell-Ritchard, a Protestant grocer, and Margaret, sometimes called &quot;Marguerite&quot; ( Collins), a Roman Catholic, in whose faith the children were raised. Educated by the Jesuits at St Aloysius&#x27; College, Cyril studied medicine at the University of Sydney until he abandoned his medical career in 1917 and decided to become an actor.

Dance teacher Minnie Hooper suggested Ritchard team up with one of her dancers, Madge Elliott, but Madge rejected him because he couldn&#x27;t dance. Two years later, after a practice waltz, Madge and Cyril realised they were a team, and they went on a dancing tour of New Zealand.

Madge and Cyril appeared in &quot;Yes, Uncle!&quot; and &quot;Going Up&quot;, both in 1918. They then went their separate ways. Ritchard shared an apartment with Walter Pidgeon in New York while he appeared there, and Madge made her first West End appearance in 1925. Ritchard joined her in London and they reestablished the dancing partnership. In 1927 Laddie Cliff booked them to star in &quot;Lady Luck&quot; at the Carlton Theatre in 1927.

In 1932 they returned to Australia where they were a hit. They appeared in a number of musicals, including &quot;Blue Roses&quot;. Their swan song performance in Australia was their wedding ceremony at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, in September 1935. There were said to be 5,000 onlookers at the wedding; Madge&#x27;s four-yard £400 veil had a starring role.

==&quot;Peter Pan&quot;==
Ritchard achieved star status in 1954 as Captain Hook in the Broadway production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; starring Mary Martin, who shared the same birthday as Ritchard (1 December). For his work in the show, he received a Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Musical. 

Both Ritchard and Martin starred in the NBC television productions of the musical, beginning with a live colour telecast in 1955. The television version was well-received, and Ritchard reprised his role in 1956 and 1960.

==Additional Roles==
He appeared as Kreton in Gore Vidal&#x27;s play &quot;Visit to a Small Planet&quot; as well as also directed it, which also starred Eddie Mayehoff. The play had tryouts at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut January 16–19, 1957. On Broadway, it debuted on February 7, 1957, and ran for 388 performances. Ritchard received a Tony Award nomination for his performance as Kreton. (Under Ritchard&#x27;s direction, Mayehoff also received a nomination for Best Performance by a Featured Actor.)

In 1958, he starred in the Cole Porter CBS television musical &quot;Aladdin&quot;. In 1959, he was nominated for a second Tony Award, for Best Actor in a Play, for &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot;.

He appeared onstage in &quot;The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd&quot; (1965), with Anthony Newley, and played Osgood Fielding in &quot;Sugar&quot; (1972). He was also a Broadway director: &quot;The Happiest Girl in the World&quot; (1961) (in which he also appeared), &quot;Roar Like a Dove&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Irregular Verb to Love&quot; (1963) (in which he also appeared).

His film appearances include the role of the villain in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s early talkie &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929) and much later in the Tommy Steele vehicle &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; (1967).

Ritchard also appeared regularly on a variety of television programs in the late 1950s and 1960s. For example, he appeared as a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on the 22 December 1957 episode of the popular Sunday night CBS-TV program. From 1956 to 1971 Ritchard played the comic villain in Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s operetta &quot;La Perichole&quot; with the Metropolitan Opera, first at the opera house in New York City and later on tour; Ritchard directed the production. He also served as a guest panelist on the Met&#x27;s radio quiz show, where he was referred to as Sir Cyril, although he was never knighted. His wife, Madge Elliott, died of cancer in 1955 in New York.

==Death==
Shortly before he died, Ritchard performed as the voice of Elrond in the Rankin/Bass television production of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Ritchard lived at The Langham, an apartment house in New York.

He suffered a heart attack on 25 November 1977, while appearing as the narrator in the Chicago touring company of &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot;. He died on 18 December 1977 in Chicago, aged 79. He was buried beside his wife at Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Ridgefield, Connecticut, near his rural home. His funeral mass was celebrated by Archbishop Fulton Sheen. He and Madge had a baby boy who died in infancy in 1939.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel John Manners Smith (30 August 1864 – 6 January 1920) was a British Indian Army and Indian Political Service officer who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==

=== Early life and career ===
Smith was educated at Norwich School and Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After transferring from the Norfolk Regiment to the British Indian Army, Smith joined the Indian Staff Corps and served with 3rd Sikhs and 5th Gurkha Rifles from 1885 to 1887, when he was appointed to the Indian Political Department. He accompanied Sir Mortimer Durand on missions to Sikkim in 1888 and to Kabul in 1893.

=== Victoria Cross ===
Smith was 27 years old, and a lieutenant in the Indian Staff Corps and 5th Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army, during the Hunza-Naga Campaign, India when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 December 1891 near Nilt Fort, British India, Lieutenant Smith led the storming party at the attack and capture of a strong position occupied by the enemy. For nearly four hours on the face of the cliff which was almost precipitous, he moved his handful of men from point to point, and during this time he was unable to defend himself from any attack which the enemy chose to make. He was the first man to reach the summit within a few yards of one of the enemy&#x27;s sangars, which was immediately rushed, the lieutenant pistolling the first man.

=== Later life and career ===
Between 1889 and 1918, Smith held political appointments in Kashmir, Bundhelkand, Baluchistan, Rajputana, Central India and Nepal. He was Chief Commissioner of Ajmer-Merwara from 1918 to 1919.

He was promoted Major in July 1901.
He achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel before he retired from the army.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Gurkha Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, England.

<doc id="1201232" wikidata="Q1191212" url="?curid=1201232" title="Low fantasy">
<text>Low fantasy, or intrusion fantasy, is a subgenre of fantasy fiction in which magical events intrude on an otherwise-normal world. The term thus contrasts with high fantasy stories, which take place in fictional worlds that have their own sets of rules and physical laws.

Intrusion fantasy places less emphasis on elements typically associated with fantasy and sets a narrative in realistic environments with elements of the fantastical. Sometimes, there are just enough fantastical elements to make ambiguous the boundary between what is real and what is purely psychological or supernatural. The word &quot;low&quot; refers to the prominence of traditional fantasy elements within the work and is not a remark on the work&#x27;s overall quality.

An alternative definition, common in role-playing games, rests on the story and characters being more realistic and less mythic in scope. Thus, some works like Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; series can be high fantasy according to the first definition but low fantasy according to the second. With other works, such as the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the opposite is true.

==History==
Fantasy fiction developed out of fairy tales in the nineteenth century. Early nineteenth century scholarship in folklore led to fantasy fiction dominating Victorian children&#x27;s literature. The genre diverged into the two subgenres, high and low fantasy, after the Edwardian era. Low fantasy itself diverged into further subgenres in the twentieth century.
The forms of low fantasy include personified animals, personified toys (including &quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; and &quot;&quot;; building on the earlier &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;), comic fantasies of exaggerated character traits and altered physics (including &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; and &quot;The Borrowers&quot;), magical powers, supernatural elements and time slips.

French fantastic fiction is predominantly within the low fantasy genre. Low fantasy corresponds to the French genre of &quot;le fantastique&quot; but French literature has no tradition equivalent to English literature&#x27;s high fantasy. According to David Ketterer, emeritus professor of English at Concordia University, Montreal, the French term &quot;le fantastique&quot; &quot;refers to a specific kind of fantasy, that in which the supernatural or the bizarre intrudes into the everyday world; the closest equivalents in English would be &#x27;low fantasy&#x27;, &#x27;dark fantasy&#x27; or &#x27;weird fiction&#x27;. &#x27;Le fantastique&#x27; does not cover the kind of complete secondary world creation typified by Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. There is no tradition of &#x27;dragons and wizards&#x27; fantasy in French.&quot; Where high fantasy does occur, the terms &quot;le merveilleux&quot; or &quot;le fantastique moderne&quot; are often used.

==Critical interpretations==
The fiction gives the author greater agency than allowed in the real world. Since being popularised in the works of E. Nesbit, the &quot;low/portal variety&quot; of fantasy has become a staple for its facility in challenging &quot;established orders of society and thought.&quot; Children usually read more low fantasy than high fantasy.

The early 21st century is seeing an increase in prominence of the work of authors such as George R. R. Martin and Joe Abercrombie, whose high fantasy novels (works set entirely in fantasy worlds) have been referred to as &quot;low fantasy&quot; because they de-emphasize magic and non-human intelligent races in favor of a more cynical portrayal of human conflict. Fantasy writer David Chandler considered this &quot;rise of &#x27;Low Fantasy to reflect the contemporary reality of the War on Terror—characterized by &quot;secret deals&quot;, &quot;vicious reprisals&quot; and &quot;sudden acts of terrifying carnage&quot;—much as the horror genre reacted to the Vietnam War a generation earlier.

==Distinguishing between subgenres==
High and low fantasy are distinguished as being set, respectively, in an alternative &quot;secondary&quot; world or in the real &quot;primary&quot; world. In many works, the distinction between primary or secondary world settings, and therefore whether it is low or high fantasy, can be unclear. The secondary world may take three forms, described by Nikki Gamble in her explication of three characteristics of high fantasy:
# Primary does not exist (e.g., &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;) or is irrelevant (e.g., &quot;Discworld&quot;)
# Entered through a portal from the primary world (e.g., &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;)
# World-within-a-world (e.g., &quot;American Gods&quot;, &quot;The Gods of Pegāna&quot;, &quot;The Magicians&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter&quot;)

A few high fantasy series do not easily fit into Gamble&#x27;s categories. For example, J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is set in the primary world of Earth in the ancient past, and Tolkien adamantly disagreed with anyone who thought otherwise. According to Tolkien, he had set it in the inhabited lands of geographically north-west Europe. Tolkien himself disagreed with the notion that his stories diverged from reality, but rather defended his position that the &quot;essentials of that abiding place are all there (at any rate for inhabitants of N.W. Europe), so naturally it feels familiar, even if a little glorified by enchantment of distance in time.&quot; Nevertheless, Middle-earth is sufficiently divergent from reality to be classed as a secondary world and hence high fantasy. J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series is again set in the real world; however, while the primary setting, mostly the school, Hogwarts, is said to be located somewhere in Scotland, it is physically separated from the real world and becomes a &quot;world-within-a-world&quot;. Similarly, Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; is largely set in an alternate Oxfordshire, a real location, but the fact that it is an alternate world at all places it in the high fantasy subgenre.

Some sources place &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; in the low fantasy genre. Karin E. Westman, writing in &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; states that because &quot;[J. K.] Rowling is much more interested in how fantasy provides perspective on everyday experience and the individual&#x27;s place in society,&quot; and her inclusion of bildungsroman (a coming-of-age story) and the school story genres, &quot;align her primarily with the domestic (or low) fantasy of authors such as E. Nesbit, Elizabeth Goudge, and Paul Gallico...as well as authors like Philip Pullman and Jonathan Stroud, who are also interested in the intersection of the personal and the political within quotidian experiences.&quot;

Low fantasy is related to a number of other genres or subgenres.
* Urban fantasy takes place in a modern urban as opposed to rural or historical setting, and thus can be viewed as a type of low fantasy.
* Dark fantasy uses fantasy to create a sense of horror or dread. Since it often has a real-world setting, there is an overlap with low fantasy.
* Paranormal romance, of which the best-known variety is the vampire romance, is nearly always low fantasy.
* Superhero fiction may count as low fantasy if the hero&#x27;s powers have a supernatural rather than a scientific (or pseudoscientific) explanation.
* Magical realism has a largely realistic view of the world but introduces supernatural elements. While authors such as Gene Wolfe and Terry Pratchett regard it as fantasy, it has been claimed as a different genre on the grounds that in magical realism the supernatural events are usually included in the worldview of the human characters while in low fantasy they usually violate it.

==Role-playing games==
For their own purposes role-playing games sometimes use a different definition of low fantasy. &quot;GURPS Fantasy&quot; defines the genre as &quot;closer to realistic fiction than to myth. Low Fantasy stories focus on people&#x27;s daily lives and practical goals ... A Low Fantasy campaign asks what it&#x27;s like to live in a world of monsters, magic, and demigods.&quot; The book acknowledges the literary definition of the genre with &quot;some critics define &#x27;low fantasy&#x27; as any fantasy story set in the real world. However, a real world setting can include the kind of mythic elements this book classifies as high fantasy.&quot;

<doc id="1201234" wikidata="Q3191670" url="?curid=1201234" title="Kabocha">
<text>Kabocha (; from Japanese , ) is a type of winter squash, a Japanese variety of the species &quot;Cucurbita maxima.&quot; It is also called kabocha squash or Japanese pumpkin in North America. In Japan, &quot;kabocha&quot; may refer to either this squash, to the Western pumpkin, or indeed to other squashes. In Australia, &quot;Japanese pumpkin&quot; is a synonym of Kent pumpkin, a variety of winter squash (&quot;C. moschata&quot;).

Many of the kabocha in the market are &quot;kuri kabocha&quot;, a type created from &quot;seiyo kabocha&quot; (buttercup squash). Varieties of kabocha include Ajihei, Ajihei No. 107, Ajihei No. 331, Ajihei No. 335, Cutie, Ebisu, Emiguri, Marron d&#x27;Or and Miyako.

==Description==
Kabocha is hard on the outside with knobbly-looking skin. It is shaped like a squat pumpkin and has a dull-finished, deep-green skin with some celadon-to-white stripes and an intense yellow-orange color on the inside. In many respects it is similar to buttercup squash, but without the characteristic protruding &quot;cup&quot; on the blossom (bottom) end. An average kabocha weighs two to three pounds, but a large squash can weigh as much as eight pounds.

== Culinary use ==
Kabocha has an exceptionally sweet flavor, even sweeter than butternut squash. It is similar in texture and flavor to a pumpkin and sweet potato combined. Some kabocha can taste like Russet potatoes or chestnuts. The rind is edible although some cooks may peel it to speed up the cooking process or to suit their personal taste preferences. Kabocha is commonly utilized in side dishes and soups, or as a substitute for potato or other squash varieties. It can be roasted after cutting the squash in half, scooping out the seeds, and then cutting the squash into wedges. With a little cooking oil and seasoning, it can be baked in the oven. Likewise, cut Kabocha halves can be added to a pressure cooker and steamed under high pressure for 15–20 minutes. One can slowly bake Kabocha whole and uncut in a convection oven, after which the entire squash becomes soft and edible, including the rind.

Kabocha is available all year but is best in late summer and early fall. 
Kabocha is primarily grown in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, California, Florida, Hawaii, Southwestern Colorado, Mexico, Tasmania, Tonga, New Zealand, Chile, Jamaica, and South Africa, but is widely adapted for climates that provide a growing season of 100 days or more. Most of the kabocha grown in California, Colorado, Tonga and New Zealand is actually exported to Japan.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, kabocha is a common ingredient in vegetable tempura and is also made into soup and croquettes. Less traditional but popular usages include its incorporation in desserts such as pies, pudding, and ice cream.

=== Korea ===
In Korea, &quot;danhobak&quot; () is commonly used for making &quot;hobak-juk&quot; (pumpkin porridge).
=== Thailand ===
&quot;Fak thong&quot; (Thai: ฟักทอง) is used in traditional Thai desserts and main courses. Kabocha is used in Jamaican chicken foot soup.

==Nutrition==
This squash is rich in beta carotene, with iron, vitamin C, potassium, and smaller traces of calcium, folic acid, and minute amounts of B vitamins.

==Ripeness==
When kabocha is just harvested, it is still growing. Therefore, unlike other vegetables and fruits, freshness is not as important. It should be &quot;fully matured&quot; first, in order to become flavorful, by first ripening the kabocha in a warm place (77 °F/25 °C) for 13 days to convert some of the starch to sugar. Then the kabocha is transferred to a cool place (50 °F/10 °C) and stored for about a month in order to increase carbohydrate content. In this way the just-harvested, dry, bland-tasting kabocha is transformed into a smooth, sweet kabocha. Fully ripened, succulent kabocha will have reddish-yellow flesh, a hard skin, and a dry, corky stem. It reaches the peak of ripeness about 1.5–3 months after it is harvested.

==History==
All squashes were domesticated in Mesoamerica. In 1997, new evidence suggested that domestication occurred 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, a few thousand years earlier than previous estimates. That would be 4,000 years earlier than the domestication of maize and beans, the other major food plant groups in Mesoamerica. Archeological and genetic plant research in the 21st century suggests that the peoples of eastern North America independently domesticated squash, sunflower, marsh elder, and chenopod.

Portuguese sailors introduced kabocha to Japan in 1541, bringing it with them from Cambodia. The Portuguese name for the squash, &quot;Camboja abóbora&quot; (), was shortened by the Japanese to &quot;kabocha&quot;. Alternatively, the Portuguese origin is the word &quot;cabaça&quot; for &quot;gourd&quot;. Kabocha is written in Kanji as (literally, &quot;southern melon&quot;), and it is also occasionally referred to as (Nanking melon). In China, this term is applied to many types of squashes with harder skin and beefier flesh (including pumpkins), not just kabochas.

<text>Sikkim Independent Front is a political party in Sikkim, founded by Ruth Karthak Lepchani in 1966. The party was formed to fight for the interests of the Lepcha people. In the 1967 state council elections the party launched six candidates (five Lepchas and one Nepali), but none were elected.

The party was repressed by the Sikkim government; the government accused Lepchani of spreading rumours against the monarchy and she was forced into exile.

Stamets credits his late brother, John, with stimulating his interest in mycology, and studied mycology as an undergraduate student. Having no academic training higher than a bachelor&#x27;s degree, Stamets is largely self-taught in the field of mycology.

Stamets received the &#x27;Bioneers&#x27; Award from the Collective Heritage Institute in 1998 and the &#x27;Award for Contributions to Amateur Mycology&#x27; from the North American Mycological Association in 2013. He also received an Invention Ambassador (2014–2015) award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

== In popular culture ==
Stamets plays a significant part in the 2019 documentary film &quot;Fantastic Fungi&quot;, and edited the film’s official companion book, &quot;Fantastic Fungi: Expanding Consciousness, Alternative Healing, Environmental Impact&quot;.

The character Lieutenant Commander Paul Stamets on the CBS series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; was named after the real Stamets. The fictional version is an astromycologist and engineer aboard the &quot;USS Discovery&quot;, and is credited with discovering how to navigate a mycelial network in space using a &quot;spore drive&quot;.

<text>Chorath, Kerith (), or sometimes Cherith (; from the Septuagint&#x27;s ), is the name of a wadi or seasonal stream mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. The prophet Elijah hid himself on the banks of the Chorath and was fed by ravens during the early part of the three years&#x27; drought which he announced to King Ahab ().

==Etymology and toponymy==
Cherith is a common English spelling of the Hebrew name, which comes from the Hebrew root meaning &quot;to cut off&quot; or &quot;cut down&quot;. The name also signifies &quot;to engrave&quot; or &quot;carve&quot;, &quot;a cutting&quot;, &quot;separation&quot;, &quot;gorge&quot;, &quot;torrent-bed&quot;, or &quot;winter-stream&quot;.

Chorath is the name used in the 3rd-century BCE Greek translation of the Torah known as the Septuagint.

The Kerith is a &quot;naḥal&quot; in Hebrew, a wadi or seasonal stream.

==Identification==
===Wadi al-Yabis===
It is usually identified with Wadi al-Yabis, a stream in western Jordan, which flows into the Jordan River at a spot opposite of Beit She&#x27;an and slightly south of it. Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of the Fertile Crescent, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. During the summer, the stream is very dry. Olive trees grow on its banks, and it is home to an array of wildlife including gazelle, hyrax, and egret.

According to the 1994 Peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, Israel can maintain its use of the Jordan River waters between the Yarmouk and Wadi al-Yabis.

===Wadi Kelt===
Alternatively, the stream Chorath has been identified by some with Wadi Qelt at the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba. If 1 Kings 17:3 is to be translated &quot;Wadi Chorath, which is east of the Jordan&quot;, this identification would be in contradiction to the Bible, since Wadi Qelt is west of it. The King James version states Elijah should &quot;turn eastward&quot; (from Samaria); therefore, the brook could be anywhere east of Samaria (now Sebastia, West Bank), on either side of the River Jordan. Some translations (i.e. the Orthodox Jewish Bible: ) allow such an interpretation, by stating that Chorath is merely &quot;near the Yarden&quot; (Yarden being the Hebrew name of the River Jordan).

===Wadi Fusail===
Conder and Kitchener noted, while writing of Qaryut, that &quot;[t]his place, being at the head of &quot;Wady Fusail&quot;, seems to have given rise to the mediaeval identification of that valley as the &quot;Brook Cherith&quot; (mentioned by Marino Sanuto in 1321).&quot; Sanuto commented that the stream extended into Phasaelis, which was named after Prince Phasael, the brother of King Herod. This identification would again contradict the more common translation of 1 Kings 17:3 (see comment above at &quot;Wadi Kelt&quot;), since Wadi Fusail with both modern Qaryut and ancient Phasaelis lie west, not east of the Jordan.

==Other uses of the name==
The name is also a Mizrahi Jewish surname, specifically among Yemenite Jews. They descend from the Banu al-Harith, which is of Qahtanite origin and was once one of the most important tribes of the city of Najran.

Irish novelist, short-story writer, poet, art critic, memoirist, and dramatist George Moore (1852–1933) wrote &quot;The Brook Kerith: A Syrian Story&quot;, which was published in 1916. It is a retelling of the New Testament account of Jesus&#x27;s life.

<doc id="1201256" wikidata="Q3547447" url="?curid=1201256" title="USS Sequoia (presidential yacht)">
<text>USS &quot;Sequoia&quot; is the former presidential yacht used during the administrations of Herbert Hoover through Jimmy Carter. To set a cost-cutting example, Carter ordered her sold in 1977.

Often called the “floating White House”, the &quot;Sequoia&quot; offered presidents, first families and high-ranking government officials a place to escape the complexities of official life while also serving as the backdrop for significant moments of 20th-century American history.

A congressional resolution passed in December 1985 stated, “Sequoia was the setting for Presidential meetings, negotiations and decisions of extraordinary significance for and effect on the history of the United States and the course of world events” and “recognized the unique significance of the former Presidential yacht Sequoia which has made her a symbol of American political heritage and the Office of the President”.

&quot;Sequoia&quot; was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1988 and according to a statement made by the President of the Mystic Seaport Museum to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Sequoia is probably the most significant artifact of presidential importance that is in private hands&quot;.

Formally decommissioned on December 9, 1935, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Sequoia continues to carry its “USS” designation.

The &quot;Sequoia&quot; is believed to have been named by her original owner, Emily Roebling Cadwalader, after Sequoyah, a leader of the Cherokee Nation.

==Design and construction==
Designed by John Trumpy and built by the famed John H. Mathis &amp; Company Shipbuilders in Camden, New Jersey, &quot;Sequoia&quot; was completed at a cost of approximately $200,000 and launched October 27, 1925. Originally named the &quot;Sequoia II,&quot; she was the second of four successively larger yachts built between 1924 and 1931 for Mr. and Mrs. Richard McCall Cadwalader of Philadelphia. The Cadwaladers&#x27; third and fourth yachts were named &quot;Savarona&quot; and &quot;Savarona II&quot;, respectively.  

At 104 feet in length, &quot;Sequoia II″s&quot; hull was originally constructed of long-leaf yellow pine on white oak frames and her deckhouse of mahogany and teak. She is capable of comfortably sleeping eight guests in her three double and two single staterooms, has ample crew quarters and can seat 22 for formal dinners.

=== Richard M. Cadwalader and Emily Roebling Cadwalader ===
Richard Cadwalader was a prominent Philadelphia banker and his wife, Emily Roebling Cadwalader, was an heiress to the Roebling fortune. Emily was the granddaughter of John Augustus Roebling, chief engineer and original designer of the Brooklyn Bridge, and was named after her paternal aunt, Emily Warren Roebling.

Emily Roebling Cadwalader became the driving force behind the four exceptional yachts constructed for the Cadwaladers, culminating in 1931 with the 446-foot &quot;Savarona II&quot;.

=== &quot;Sequoia II&quot;″s christening and early use ===
Local newspapers recount that on October 26, 1925 after arriving with her party in two Rolls-Royce automobiles, Mrs. Cadwalader broke a bottle of champagne against the bow of the &quot;Sequoia II&quot; commemorating its service to her family. Oddly, these accounts of &quot;Sequoia II&quot;″s christening make no mention of prohibition when discussing the champagne. The Cadwaladers sailed &quot;Sequoia II&quot; on various high-profile trips to the coasts of Florida during 1925 and 1926, including to West Palm Beach and Miami.

Three years after being built for the Cadwaladers, &quot;Sequoia II&quot; was sold to William Dunning, a Houston-based oil executive who used the vessel for various gambling trips to Cuba and business-related travel along the Mexican coastline. Dunning was forced to sell &quot;Sequoia II&quot; during the Great Depression.

==U.S. Government service==
On March 24, 1931, the U.S. Bureau of Navigation within the Department of Commerce purchased &quot;Sequoia II&quot; from Dunning for approximately $40,000. &quot;Sequoia II&quot; initially was used to patrol the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays as a decoy vessel to attract would-be bootleggers. In hope of selling illegal liquor, bootleggers would come alongside what was seen as a wealthy family&#x27;s yacht only to be arrested.

=== Presidential service ===
==== Hoover Administration ====
Herbert Hoover was known to have an affection for Mathis-Trumpy houseboats, such as &quot;Sequoia&quot;, and had spent time both between his election victory and inauguration and during the early part of his administration cruising and fishing in Florida aboard the yacht &quot;Saunterer&quot;, a 98-foot Mathis-Trumpy house boat owned by his friend, Jeremiah Milbank.

Having decommissioned the former presidential yacht &quot;The Mayflower&quot; in 1929, Herbert Hoover initiated &quot;Sequoia II&quot;″s presidential service by using her on various occasions during the final years of his Administration. This included four documented voyages from 1931 to 1933 for official presidential business as well as for pleasure cruises. Various news outlets reported on the status of Hoover&#x27;s fishing trips aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot;. During 1932, President and Mrs. Hoover spent both Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve aboard the &quot;Sequoia II&quot; as part of a ten-day fishing trip along the Georgia and Florida coastlines. Hoover used a photo of the indulgent yacht on his 1932 White House Christmas Card, when many Americans were suffering through the Depression and struggling for basic necessities.

==== Roosevelt Administration ====
President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the yacht more frequently, with over fifty recorded outings between 1933 and 1935. On March 25, 1933, what was now known simply as &quot;Sequoia&quot; and no longer &quot;Sequoia II,&quot; became the official presidential yacht after it was transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Naval Department. An elevator was installed to enable access for the polio-stricken President, who, like Hoover before him, enjoyed fishing aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot; and also used the vessel for important meetings and summits.

On April 23, 1933, President Roosevelt hosted British Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald as his first guest on the &quot;Sequoia&quot;. During a cruise to Mount Vernon they discussed the Great Depression, demilitarization, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise and strategies for averting the threat of a potential new war with Germany. As it became clear these efforts were failing and war approached, the wooden &quot;Sequoia&quot; was deemed unsafe for the President, and on December 9, 1935, &quot;Sequoia&quot; was officially reassigned to the Secretary of the Navy and the steel-hulled was designated as the presidential yacht. For the next three decades, &quot;Sequoia&quot; served at the pleasure of the United States Secretary of the Navy until its recommissioning in 1969 as a presidential yacht.

==== Truman Administration ====
While serving as the yacht for the Secretary of the Navy, U.S. presidents and members of the Cabinet continued to use the Sequoia, often providing the backdrop for critical moments in American history.

President Harry S. Truman who used the as his official yacht, nevertheless called upon &quot;Sequoia&quot; to host the first atomic arms control talks. Just three months after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it was aboard the &quot;Sequoia&quot; during a November 1945 cruise down the Potomac past Mount Vernon that Truman first discussed the promise of atomic power and the need to control atomic weapons with the United States&#x27; closest allied leaders, Prime Ministers Clement Attlee of Great Britain and Mackenzie King of Canada. On September 16, 1946, then General Dwight David Eisenhower&#x27;s calendar shows he met aboard the &quot;Sequoia&quot; with U.S. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, General Carl Spaatz, and British Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery. This meeting, under the guise of a cruise to Mount Vernon, initiated a series of highly classified political and military discussions from which emerged the Western European Union, which formed in 1948, followed by NATO a year later. General Eisenhower later served from 1951 to 1952 as the first Supreme Commander of NATO.

==== Eisenhower Administration ====
On election to the presidency, Eisenhower ordered his Joint Chiefs of Staff (including Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs) to meet on the &quot;Sequoia&quot; to further formulate and develop a plan for implementing Eisenhower&#x27;s “New Look” defensive policy. On August 6, 1953, Admiral Radford and his fellow Chiefs set sail in the Chesapeake Bay aboard the &quot;Sequoia.&quot; The military leaders understood the President wanted a consensus and it was not until late on August 8, once the Chiefs had all signed what would be known as the &quot;Sequoia Report&quot;, that the &quot;Sequoia&quot; returned to Washington. The Sequoia Report helped introduce a defensive strategy to reduce the overall size and cost of the military and rely heavily on nuclear deterrence, a doctrine that would serve as a defining turning point in U.S. strategy during the Cold War.

==== Kennedy Administration ====
President Kennedy&#x27;s use of &quot;Sequoia&quot; is not as well documented as that of other presidents. Government photographers did not accompany him on the yacht, and curiously, immediately after his assassination, an order was given to destroy all personal logs associated with &quot;Sequoia&quot;″s use during the Kennedy Administration. At the time, Paul “Red” Fay, one of Kennedy&#x27;s closest friends and confidants, served as Acting Secretary of the Navy.

During October 1962, President Kennedy held strategy meetings on &quot;Sequoia&quot; to discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis. On May 29, 1963, the Kennedys hosted a cruise to celebrate the President&#x27;s 46th and final birthday. At 8 pm, the couple boarded &quot;Sequoia&quot; to the music of two orchestras. With 25 friends and family, the President and his guests danced after a meal of roast filet and Dom Perignon. In the words of Clement Norton, a close Kennedy family friend who was aboard that night, “You never can imagine anything happier or more normal or nice.” The iconic photographs documenting the President&#x27;s last birthday were not taken by an official White House photographer, but by the navy officer in charge of &quot;Sequoia&quot; using his own Kodak Instamatic camera.

At the time President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963 he and the First Lady were scheduled to host friends for a Sunday cruise aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot;, two days later, on November 24, 1963. In April 1964, the widowed Mrs. Kennedy spent an evening aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot; with a group of President Kennedy&#x27;s closest friends. Frank Gannon, the piano player aboard that day, recounts a poignantly sad story of Mrs. Kennedy requesting him to play “Me and My Shadow” a song about being alone. On May 27, 1964, two days before what would have been Kennedy&#x27;s 47th birthday, his closest family and some friends once again gathered aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot; for a dinner cruise documented by Kennedy speechwriter and presidential historian, Arthur Schlesinger Jr.

==== Johnson Administration ====

In an interview after her husband had left office, former first Lady, Lady Bird Johnson, remembered the Johnson&#x27;s “love affair with the &quot;Sequoia&quot; goes back indeed to 1949.” Having become friends with then Secretary of the Navy and soon to be Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, the future president and First Lady had been invited guests aboard the ship on numerous occasions during the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations.

As Kennedy&#x27;s vice president, Johnson made eight recorded trips aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot;. As president, Johnson&#x27;s use of &quot;Sequoia&quot; would increase, with more than 35 recorded trips during his 5 years in office. During 1964, President Johnson ordered FDR&#x27;s elevator removed and a bar installed in its place. Johnson used &quot;Sequoia&quot; to lobby members of congress on critical legislative matters including civil rights and to strategize with his advisors regarding important decisions including escalation of the Vietnam war. &quot;Sequoia&quot; was used for hosting foreign ambassadors, as well as the leaders of Turkey and Greece who discussed the ongoing issue of Cyprus. President Johnson frequently used &quot;Sequoia&quot; as a place to unwind and watch a film.

==== Nixon Administration ====
&quot;Sequoia&quot;″s most frequent presidential passenger was Johnson&#x27;s successor, Richard Nixon. President Nixon recorded more than 80 trips aboard the yacht while in office.

On June 19, 1973, a party of U.S. and Soviet diplomats accompanied the President and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev on a working dinner aboard the yacht. Throughout their cruise, the leaders discussed an agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, regarding the prevention of nuclear war, which was signed by Nixon and Brezhnev two days later on June 22, 1973, during the Washington Summit. It was aboard the Sequoia that Nixon decided to resign and informed his family. In a 1983 interview conducted by Frank Gannon of the Nixon Foundation titled, &quot;The Smoking Gun and the Sequoia&quot;, Nixon describes the August 5, 1974, cruise aboard the &quot;Sequoia&quot; during which he learned that a court had ordered him to release the transcript of a tape recording which showed he approved the cover-up of the Watergate break-in.

==== Ford Administration ====
Following President Nixon&#x27;s resignation on August 9, 1974, Gerald Ford assumed the presidency. Ford used &quot;Sequoia&quot; less than Nixon. In May 1975, Ford was the first known president to host a Cabinet meeting aboard the vessel. Lasting four hours, the President and his cabinet discussed wide-ranging issues facing the United States, including a discussion regarding Congressional relations, confronting the issue of Vietnamese refugees, and the status of the U.S. Energy program in light of the 1973 oil crisis.

Later that summer, Happy Rockefeller, wife of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, entertained Mutsuko Miki (wife of the Prime Minister of Japan) on a cruise along the Potomac during a state visit. Similarly, in October, 1975, the yacht would cruise along the Potomac to entertain Emperor Hirohito and the accompanying delegation from Japan. Another notable visitor aboard the Sequoia during the Ford years was the prime minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, who in 1976, had a working dinner with the President aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot;.

President Ford celebrated his 62nd birthday on the &quot;Sequoia&quot; shortly after a surprise party given by White House staff. In 1975, Susan Ford hosted a pre-prom party aboard the yacht with a group of friends, and then celebrated her 19th birthday aboard the &quot;Sequoia&quot; the following year. First Lady Betty Ford hosted a June 9, 1976 &quot;Sequoia&quot; cruise in celebration of Happy Rockefeller&#x27;s 50th birthday.

==== Carter Administration ====
After 46 years of government service, citing cost concerns – the &quot;Sequoia&quot; cost taxpayers an estimated $800,000 annually – President Jimmy Carter ordered the &quot;Sequoia&quot; be sold at auction. Carter would later recall selling the yacht as a mistake. In a conversation with broadcaster Ray Suarez, Carter said: “People thought I was not being reverent enough to the office I was holding, that I was too much of a peanut farmer, not enough of an aristocrat, or something like that. So I think that shows that the American people want something of, an element of, image of monarchy in the White House.” In his 2015 autobiography &quot;A Full Life: Reflections at 90&quot;, President Carter wrote of selling &quot;Sequoia, &quot;&quot;I was determined to be strict on expenditures for the nation, and to set an example in my personal life. I decided to sell the presidential yacht &quot;Sequoia&quot;, and to minimize the playing of “Ruffles and Flourishes” when I arrived at public meetings. I was surprised when some of these changes proved to be quite unpopular, and to learn how much the public cherished the pomp and ceremony of the presidency.&quot;

=== Winston Churchill and the &quot;Sequoia&quot; ===
&quot;Sequoia&quot; served as refuge for presidents to relax with friends and conduct business outside of the public spotlight. As a result, no official documentary evidence exists for many events which took place aboard the yacht, and certain lore has developed, particularly regarding British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s activities aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot;. This includes, but is not limited to, Churchill and Roosevelt planning D-Day together on the large table in &quot;Sequoia&quot;″s main salon, Churchill gifting deck chairs from the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; for &quot;Sequoia&quot;″s upper deck and Churchill being the impetus behind Roosevelt decommissioning the USS &quot;Sequoia&quot; so that the two leaders could drink on board – alcoholic beverages were prohibited aboard commissioned naval vessels. Despite these persistent legends, Churchill was never documented as being aboard the yacht.

==Private ownership==
&quot;Sequoia&quot; has been owned by seven different owners since being sold by the U.S. government in 1977. Several of the past owners sought to offset the costs of maintaining and operating the vessel by offering &quot;Sequoia&quot; for private charter, while others have been non-profit groups seeking to maintain her for historical reasons and/or return her to presidential service.

Thomas Malloy purchased &quot;Sequoia&quot; from the U.S. government on May 18, 1977 for $286,000. Three months later, Malloy resold &quot;Sequoia&quot; to a partnership led by Norman Pulliam for $355,000. Mr. Pulliam maintained &quot;Sequoia&quot; in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and then sold her to The Ocean Learning Institute of Palm Beach, Florida during March 1980 for $750,000. The institute used &quot;Sequoia&quot; to entertain potential donors.

The Presidential Yacht Trust, a non-profit organization, acquired &quot;Sequoia&quot; from the Institute for approximately $1.1 million in 1980 and brought &quot;Sequoia&quot; back to Washington, D.C. for use by the president and his cabinet. Michael Doud Gill, who headed the yacht trust, said, &quot;There is some feeling in the White House that the president] should not be on a million-dollar yacht when he has to cut programs such as food stamps and such.&quot; Although, Reagan preferred to appear on horseback, he authorized his Cabinet&#x27;s use of &quot;Sequoia&quot;. During an August 1982 luncheon aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot;, EPA administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford allegedly told eight Reagan Administration officials that she was holding back federal funds to clean up a toxic waste site near Los Angeles to avoid helping the Senate campaign of California&#x27;s then-Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat. When Congress charged the EPA had mishandled such toxic waste Superfund sites and demanded records, Gorsuch refused and became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for contempt of Congress. During 1984 &quot;Sequoia&quot; received a hero&#x27;s welcome as she was taken on an eight-month, 6,000-mile tour of the country.

A congressional resolution written to assist the Trust in bringing &quot;Sequoia&quot; back into government service, passed in December 1985. &quot;Sequoia&quot; underwent a $2 million restoration in 1986 before participating in the flotilla of vessels celebrating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986. Vice President George H.W. Bush used &quot;Sequoia&quot; in May 1987 to host a day of meetings with Yang Shangkun who subsequently served as President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1988 to 1993. &quot;Sequoia&quot; was designated as a National Historic Landmark in March 1988. Political considerations dictated that if the &quot;Sequoia&quot; were to be returned to the government for use by the president, the cost should not be born by the U.S. government. The Trust was surprised by the Navy&#x27;s requirement that the Trust not only pay for the yacht and its operations but also the security which would be required by the President. Unable to pay a $2 million repair bill, title to the yacht was transferred to the Virginia shipyard and &quot;Sequoia&quot; spent six years in storage.

Upon taking office, the Clinton White House worked closely with the Trust during 1993 and 1994 to have Kuwait purchase &quot;Sequoia&quot; from the Virginia yard where she was being stored and transfer title to the Trust as gift to the American people and a gesture of gratitude to the US for leading a coalition of 34 countries in liberating Kuwait after Saddam Hussein&#x27;s 1990 Iraqi invasion.

A Japanese buyer was about to purchase &quot;Sequoia&quot; and move her to Tokyo, when the Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group LLC purchased &quot;Sequoia&quot; from the Virginia shipyard in September 2000 for approximately $2.0 million and made her available in Washington, D.C. for private charters until 2014.

President Clinton attended one such event aboard &quot;Sequoia&quot; on October 17, 2000—making him the 10th person who served as U.S. president to walk upon &quot;Sequoia&quot;&#x27;s decks—the full list includes: Herbert C. Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, George H. W. Bush (while Vice President) and William J. Clinton.

In 2005, the Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Connecticut entered into an exclusive six-month option agreement to purchase Sequoia from the Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group but was unable to raise the $20 million needed to buy, restore, and maintain the vessel. Upon the expiration of its option, the museum&#x27;s president told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[He] was disappointed because the Sequoia, a national historic landmark, is probably the most desirable vessel in private hands.&quot;

&quot;Sequoia&quot; is currently owned by FE Partners, a portfolio company of the Washington, D.C.-based Equator Capital Group which purchased &quot;Sequoia&quot; in October 2016 for $7.8 million. Equator Capital is controlled by L. Michael Cantor and is in the process of restoring the &quot;Sequoia&quot; at a repair yard in Belfast, Maine. When asked about future plans by &quot;MegaYacht News&quot;, Cantor stated, &quot;Once restored, our intention is to bring &quot;Sequoia&quot; back to Washington where she will serve as a venue to teach American presidential history and promote ocean conservation causes&quot;

FE Partners purchased &quot;Sequoia&quot; after a protracted litigation with The Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group, the former owner who believed &quot;Sequoia&quot; to be worth significantly more than the $7.8 million purchase price and filed a January 2013 lawsuit against FE Partners to block the sale. As part of a loan agreement, the former owner had provided FE Partners with an option to purchase Sequoia for $13 million or in the event of a default under the loan agreement for $7.8 million. On August 29, 2013, a Delaware Court entered a Default Judgment against the former owner and confirmed FE Partner&#x27;s contractual right to purchase &quot;Sequoia&quot; for $7.8 million. On November 14, 2017, the same Delaware Court found the aggregate amount of funds which had been loaned by FE Partners to the former owner, legal fees, &quot;Sequoia&quot;&#x27;s 3rd part debts and the cost to repair &quot;Sequoia&quot; exceeded the $7.8 million purchase price. As a consequence, the Court also ruled FE Partners was not required to pay any additional funds to the former owner.

Upon purchasing &quot;Sequoia&quot; in October 2016, FE Partners filed a lawsuit against Chesapeake Boat Works of Deltaville, Virginia which had damaged &quot;Sequoia&quot; while hauling her out of the water on a marine railway during December 2014. FE Partners won a $700,000 settlement award against the Virginia shipyard on February 22, 2019, and then began the process of removing &quot;Sequoia&quot; from the railway, placing her on a barge and transporting the barge from Virginia to Maine. In September 2019, the &quot;Sequoia&quot; was first moved by barge from Deltaville, Virginia, to Cambridge, Maryland. and then during October, from Cambridge, Maryland to Belfast, Maine where &quot;Sequoia&quot; arrived on October 22, 2019, to begin its restoration by French &amp; Webb Inc for an undisclosed price. In October 2023, &quot;Sequoia&quot; returned to Cambridge, Maryland for an estimated five-year, $15 million renovation.

==2020 restoration plans==
According to MegaYacht News, the &quot;Sequoia&quot; restoration will require 9 to 10 months of careful planning before the refurbishment itself can start. French and his team are sourcing woods to supplement and/or replace her long-leaf yellow pine, mahogany, and teak. In October 2023, the &quot;Sequoia&quot; was moved to Cambridge, Maryland for restoration.

<text>Sikkim Scheduled Caste League (SSCL), a political party in Sikkim, was formed on the model of the Scheduled Caste League of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. SSCL demanded a democratic government, as opposed to the then monarchic regime of Sikkim.

In the first State Council elections in 1953, SSCL had launched two candidates. None was elected.

The party also participated in the 1967 and 1979 elections. In the 1979 legislative assembly elections the party had two candidates, whom together got 85 votes. Purna Bahadur Khati stood in Ratneypani-West Pendam where he got 68 votes (2.74% of the votes in that constituency) and Sukman Dorjee stood in Khamdong where he got 17 votes (0.7%). Both constituencies were reserved for Scheduled Castes, the only two such constituencies in the state.

<text>The Coalition for Free and Open Elections (COFOE) is a nonpartisan organization in the United States that aims to promote fair ballot access. COFOE was founded in 1985, when representatives from across the political spectrum met in the New York City law office of former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark. 

Participants in the early days of COFOE included political independents and members of the Citizens Party; the Communist Party; the Libertarian Party; the New Alliance Party; the Prohibition Party; and the Socialist Party USA. One of the early chairs of COFOE was Socialist David McReynolds, who was succeeded by Ann Rosenhaft and then by Si Gerson of the Communist Party. It has largely been due to the steadfast work of Richard Winger, editor and publisher of &quot;Ballot Access News&quot;, that COFOE has survived, and grown, as an organization. 

COFOE has filed amicus briefs in numerous court cases relating to ballot access. As of August 2021, members of COFOE include the American Solidarity Party; the Constitution Party; FairVote; the Green Party; Independent Voting; the Libertarian Party; the Prohibition Party; the Reform Party, and the Socialist Party USA.

==Related organizations==
In the late 1990s a national ballot access organization with a focus similar to that of COFOE held several meetings in the Washington, D.C., area, attended by members of the Green Party, Libertarian Party, Natural Law Party, Reform Party, Socialist Party USA, various independents, and others. This new national ballot access coalition discussed the possibility of formally constituting a tax-exempt civic organization for purposes of ballot access litigation and education; at one point some participants in this group considered borrowing the COFOE name.

<text>Zavidovići () is a city and municipality located in Zenica-Doboj Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, located between Doboj and Zenica on the confluence of rivers Bosna, Krivaja and Gostović. It sits in a valley surrounded by many mountains of which the largest is Klek. As of 2013, the municipality had a population of 35,988 inhabitants and the city itself 8,174.

==History==
Zavidovići was home to two neolithic cultures: Butmir and Kakanj. Significant Kakanj culture site is located in Tuk.

Zavidovići was developed by the Austrians during the 19th century Austro-Hungarian reign in Bosnia, mostly because of the &quot;wood industry&quot;. After World War II, Krivaja, the company that was founded in 1884 and named after the Krivaja river, expanded. The company focused on furniture manufacturing, which it began to export to the United States under the name &quot;Krivaja Beechbrook&quot;. Due to the Bosnian War in the 1990s, the former giant and the city were left with almost nothing.

Although once a diverse town, many of the former Serb and Croat residents left their homes during the Bosnian War. Few have returned to their properties. Now, it is a mostly Bosniak city, with few non-Bosniaks remaining.

Zavidovići&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Wood Town&quot;. Zavidovići is located in the basin of three rivers: Bosna, Krivaja and Gostović.
