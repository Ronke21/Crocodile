<text>Major David Auldjo Jamieson, (1 October 1920 – 5 May 2001) was a British Army officer in the Second World War who received the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
David Auldjo Jamieson was born in Westminster on 1 October 1920, the elder son of Sir Archibald Auldjo Jamieson, chairman of Vickers Armstrong. He attended Ladycross School at Seaford, East Sussex, and Eton College where he was a cadet in the Officers&#x27; Training Corps. In his youth he spent time at the family holiday retreat in Norfolk. 

He volunteered in the Territorial Army unit at Dersingham for the 5th Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1939. He was transferred to the 7th Battalion, formed as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 5th Bn when the Territorial Army was doubled in size.

==Second World War==
Aged 19 on the outbreak of the Second World War, Jamieson was considered too young for overseas service and did not initially go with the battalion to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) when it went to France in 1940 but followed later. 

The battalion was assigned to pioneer duties in France with the BEF. In May 1940, it was attached to the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division which was stationed on the Maginot Line and therefore escaped encirclement with the majority of the BEF during the Battle of France. The 7th Royal Norfolks suffered heavy casualties when the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was surrounded and forced to surrender on 12 June 1940, with only 31 members of the battalion managing to return to Britain. When the majority of the battalion was captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, he was at Rouen and was able to return to Britain. 

The battalion was reformed in 1941 and Jamieson was promoted to company commander of D Company. In 1942, the battalion was transferred to the 176th Infantry Brigade of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. The 59th Division, commanded by Major General Lewis Lyne, was one of the follow-up units after the Normandy landings in June 1944.

The battalion was involved in the Battle of Normandy, including the capture of Caen during Operation Charnwood, where the battalion suffered over 150 casualties, which was followed by the Second Battle of the Odon. For his leadership Ian Freeland was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

===Victoria Cross===
Jamieson was a 23-year-old captain in the 7th Battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment, part of the 176th Infantry Brigade attached to the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 7/8 August 1944, south of Grimbosq, Normandy, France, Jamieson was in command of D Company, being the only officer remaining, which had established a bridgehead over the River Orne. The enemy made seven counter-attacks on the company&#x27;s position by elements of the 271st Volksgrenadier Division and 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, but throughout 36 hours of bitter and close fighting Captain Jamieson&#x27;s company refused to give up. The attacks included assaults with Tiger and Panther tanks which shot up the Churchill tanks supporting the Royal Norfolks. 

Jamieson was giving map references for British artillery; directing the resources of first the divisional artillery, then the medium artillery of the corps.

Jamieson at one point mounted the last British tank to talk to the commander under enemy fire in order to direct the tank to retreat. He dismissed it as anything heroic, saying that he had to as the telephone didn&#x27;t work – tanks were equipped with an external handset so that the commander could talk to an infantry commander without opening the hatch. The image of Captain Jamieson riding a Churchill tank while enemy tanks attacked was immortalised in a painting. As he was talking to the commander, the tank was hit and Jamieson blown off. He returned to his &quot;hole&quot; where he received treatment - he had lost an eye and was bleeding from his arm. After relief by another battalion, Jamieson was evacuated to a first aid post and then back to the UK.

The citation for Jamieson in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; supplement of 26 October 1944 reads, in part: 
==Post-war==
Following the war, he worked for the Australian Agricultural Company, which ran several sheep and cattle stations; he became a director in 1949 and was Governor from 1951 to 1975. He was also director of other companies including National Westminster Bank.

In 1948 he married Nancy Elwes, who died in a car accident in 1963. He remarried, to Joanna Windsor-Clive, in 1969. 

He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1979. In 1968 he was appointed to the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, retiring as lieutenant in 1990. In the 1990 New Year Honours he was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). Due to his height, 6 ft 5, he was informally designated the ceremonial umbrella man to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, carrying an umbrella over her at social functions.

He died on 5 May 2001 in Burnham Market, Norfolk, and was interred in the churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Burnham Norton. He was survived by his widow, his son Andrew Jamieson, and two daughters of his first marriage, three grandchildren, and by a stepson and stepdaughter.

<text>Myshall () is a village, townland and civil parish in County Carlow, Ireland. The village is southeast of Carlow town, on the slopes of Mount Leinster and on the R724 road.

==Adelaide Memorial Church==
The Church of Ireland Adelaide Memorial Church of Christ the Redeemer in Myshall is a miniature version of Salisbury Cathedral. Completed in 1913, Dover-based businessman, John Duguid, commissioned it in memory of his daughter Constance, who was killed in a horse riding accident while visiting her sister in Myshall, and her mother Adelaide, who died in 1903. Both are buried here.

The parish of Myshall has five cemeteries: three in the village itself, one about a mile out the Carlow road, and one in Drumphea about two miles from the village.

==Sport==
Myshall is home to Naomh Eoin GAA club. Since its formation the club has won 18 Carlow Senior Hurling Championships. They are also the only Carlow team to have won a senior hurling and football double (in 1986) and an U-21 hurling and football double in 2010. The Juvenile Teams range from U6-to U18 or Minor.

Myshall is also the home of Myshall Camogie Club. This club won the county camogie championship for 15 years in a row and 3-in-a-row in the Leinster junior club competition (2011, 2012, and 2013) and were All-Ireland junior club champions in 2012 and 2013.

<text>The livenka () or Livenskaya garmoshka () is a specific variety of accordion used in Russian folk music, specifically in the region around the town of Livny (Oryol Oblast), from which the instrument takes its name.

==Description==
*The livenka is a unisonoric instrument, meaning that each button produces the same tone, regardless of the direction of the bellows.
*The right-hand buttons (of which there may be 12 to 15) play the notes of the &quot;obikhodnyy&quot; pitch set, which may also be thought of as a series of overlapping Mixolydian modes. (Banin, A.A. 1997. p.161)
*The left-hand levers play intervals of thirds or fourths, so that adjacent levers operated simultaneously will play a triad.
*The livenka has a very long bellows, when compared to other accordions—sometimes having forty folds, and extending to over a meter in length.

==History==
The name of the inventor of the livenka was not preserved. It is believed to have been developed in the second half of the 19th century as a modification of existing German or Russian button accordions.

<text>MV &quot;Skeena Queen&quot; is a ferry built in 1997 and named after the Skeena River. She was intended to be part of a class of spartan, utilitarian ferries, in the &quot;Century ferry class&quot;, designed by the naval architects McLaren and Sons In 1994 the 10-year plan of BC Ferries called for construction of three Century-class ferries, to service the busier Gulf Island routes in British Columbia operated by BC Ferries. The name for the class was derived from the capacity, which is approximately 100 cars. However, the only ferry of the class actually built was &quot;Skeena Queen&quot;. She runs solely on the Swartz Bay-Saltspring Island (at Fulford Harbour) route (except for a brief four-day trial on the Horseshoe Bay to Bowen Island run from April 23 to April 26, 1998 and providing partial coverage between Swartz Bay and Pender Island in Spring of 2018 due to another vessel being removed from service for repairs).

There is some speculation as to why the other two vessels in the class were not built. The obvious reason is that the high speed ferry program consumed all available funds. Others point to the problems with the four owner selected main propulsion engines that plagued &quot;Skeena Queen&quot; following commission, including excessively high noise levels and cylinder counterbore cracking in the high-speed engines. On April 15, 2002 &quot;Skeena Queen&quot; was removed from service and her four high-speed Mitsubishi S12R diesel engines were replaced with four Mitsubishi medium-speed engines, model S6U. The new engines were provided by Mitsubishi at a never disclosed price.

&quot;Skeena Queen&quot; has the following characteristics:

* Overall length: 110.0 m
* Gross tonnage: 2,453
* Vehicle capacity: 100 spaces 17.5 feet long by 8.5 feet wide
* Passenger and crew capacity: 600 
* Service Speed: at 3500 bhp
* Installed Power: 5,040 hp (3.8 MW)

&quot;Skeena Queen&quot; has very little cabin space because the Century ferry class was intended to be used on short commuter runs of less than a half-hour duration where most of the passengers stay in their vehicles. &quot;Skeena Queen&quot; operates solely on the route between Swartz Bay and Fulford Harbour, which is a 35-minute crossing.

<text>David Hawkes VC (c. 1822 – 14 August 1858) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Imperial forces.

==Details==
Hawkes was 35 years old, from Witham, Essex and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place at the Siege of Lucknow for which he, Henry Wilmot and William Nash were awarded the VC:
He was killed in action at Faizabad, British India, on 14 August 1858. As he was killed before he could hear news of the award of a VC (24 December 1858) it was decided to send his father William the award. His VC is located at The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

<text>Henry William Pitcher VC (20 December 1841 – 5 July 1875) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Details==
Pitcher was born at Kamptee in British India, the second son of Vincent Pitcher and Rose Mary le Geyt, daughter of Admiral George le Geyt. His elder brother Colonel Duncan George Pitcher also served in India.

He was about 22 years old and a lieutenant in the Bengal Staff Corps, 4th Punjab Infantry, British Indian Army during the Umbeyla Campaign. On 30 October 1863 in North-West India, Lieutenant Pitcher led a party to recapture the Crag Picquet after its garrison had been driven in by the enemy and sixty of them killed. He led the party up the narrow path to the last rock until he was knocked down and stunned by a large stone thrown from above. On 16 November, the lieutenant displayed great courage in leading a party to the Crag Picquet when it had again fallen into enemy hands. He led the first charge, but was wounded in the action. For this deed he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

He later achieved the rank of captain and died of heatstroke, while serving with the 1st Punjab Infantry, on 5 July 1875 at Dehra Ghazi Khan. His VC is on display in Jersey Museum.
==Early life==
Pitcher is one of five that attended Victoria College, Jersey whom were awarded the Victoria Cross. A replica is on display opposite the Headmasters office in The Main Building.

<text>Bricktown is an entertainment district just east of downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States. It was formerly a major warehouse district. The major attractions of the district are the Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, the navigable Bricktown Canal, and the 16-screen Harkins movie theatre.

==Boundaries and management==
Bricktown Entertainment District includes some 50 square city blocks bounded between the Oklahoma River on the south, I-235 on the east, Deep Deuce District to the North, and the Oklahoma City Central Business District to the West. The general boundary of the Bricktown Core Development District (also known as Upper Bricktown) is as follows: An area bordered generally by the BNSF Railway; Reno Avenue; Centennial Expressway; and the railroad right-of-way between Main and NE 1st.

The district is administered by the Bricktown Urban Design Committee which was established by the City of Oklahoma City to oversee modifications to the buildings and new construction within the district. Downtown Oklahoma City Inc. (an arm of the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce) is charged with maintenance and operations of the district and oversees promotion alongside the Oklahoma City Tourism and Visitors Bureau. All entities are united with the ultimate goal of preserving Bricktown&#x27;s historic &#x27;warehouse district&#x27; flavor while allowing modern entertainment, commercial, retail, and residential development to flourish.

==History==

Four railroad companies had freight operations east of the Santa Fe tracks in what is now Bricktown in the late 19th and early 20th century. The first brick structures, which were typically only one or two stories, appeared between 1898 and 1903. Larger brick buildings were constructed between 1903 and 1911, and the tallest brick buildings were built between 1911 and 1930. Working-class houses were built nearby.

Oklahoma City&#x27;s first black newspaper, the &quot;Black Dispatch&quot;, was located in Bricktown at 228 E. First; it reported on the struggle to end racially segregated housing in the city. Also in that area was the first local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in the early 20th century to work for the civil rights of African Americans.

The decline of the area began with the onset of the Great Depression, which diminished businesses in the area. The growth of eastern suburbs and subsidized highways during and after World War II attracted many residents to newer housing. Railroads restructured and freight traffic moved to trucks and highways. By 1980, Bricktown had become a cluster of abandoned buildings.

In the 1990s, mayor Ron Norick persuaded Oklahoma City residents to approve a series of tax incentives to lure new businesses, but these were not sufficient. A visit to Indianapolis, Indiana, which had recently beat the city in a competition for a new airline maintenance plant, led him to believe that Oklahoma City needed a vibrant downtown. It lacked the range of activities and amenities to attract more residents and visitors. Along with Greater Oklahoma City Chamber President Ray Ackerman, Norick and their staffs developed the Metropolitan Area Projects or MAPS, which approval led to the construction of the Bricktown ballpark and a tree-lined, mile-long canal through the district, as well as other projects in downtown. The ballpark opened in 1998 and the canal opened in July 1999. Water taxis provide interactive guided tours featuring Oklahoma City history, Bricktown businesses, and local art along the canal.

In 2024, a $1.6 billion development was proposed that included plans to construct the tallest skyscraper in the United States.

==Arts and culture==
The district contains a number of public sculptures and murals, including a monument to the Oklahoma Land Run. The Centennial Land Run Monument, a large bronze sculpture by artist Paul Moore, is at the south end of Bricktown Canal. It commemorates the Land Run of 1889, which marked the opening of the Unassigned Lands area to settlement. This area is now a city park, open 24 hours a day, year round, and there is no admission fee.

An annual Bricktown Art Festival is held in mid-July.

==Transportation==

The Oklahoma City Streetcar loops around Bricktown and connects the neighborhood to downtown. It opened in December 2018.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; service to Fort Worth departs every morning from the old Santa Fe Depot, located by the west entrance to Bricktown, and returns in the evenings.

The school was formed in 1991 when Miraleste High School, Palos Verdes High School, and Rolling Hills High School were merged into a single high school. The former Rolling Hills High School campus (opened 1964) had the highest capacity and was used for the combined school. When overcrowding became a problem after 1999, the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District elected to re-open Palos Verdes High School in 2002.

== Demographics ==
In the 2023–24 year, there were 2,175 students enrolled in Palos Verdes Peninsula High School. Enrollment by race/ethnicity was 39.40% Asian, 32.55% White, 15.26% Hispanic, 2.21% Black, and 10.30% other. Enrollment by gender was 50.71% male and 49.01% female.
==Athletics==
In 2014, as a senior, future major leaguer Eli Morgan had a 10–2 win–loss record with a 1.23 earned run average. He was named Bay League Co-Pitcher of the Year and All-California Interscholastic Federation First Team.

== Extracurricular Activities and Programs ==
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School offers a large variety of extracurricular activities including, but not limited to, Model United Nations, Speech &amp; Debate, Mock Trial, CyberPatriots, FRC Robotics, Science Research, and Academic Decathlon. Its Speech &amp; Debate and Model United Nations programs are nationally ranked.

In October 2022, the school&#x27;s Model United Nations program, together with Rotary Club of Palos Verdes Sunset and Rotary E-Club of District 2750 Tokyo Yoneyama, hosted the 1st Rotary Peace Conference with speakers such as Best Delegate CEO, Kevin Chan, and Ihor Kukhlevsky, a Ukrainian refugee. It was dedicated to bringing awareness to the atomic bombings in 1945 and nuclear weapons. A tree from Heiwa (Hiroshima Survivor Trees) was planted by California Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi afterwards.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 25 (VFA-25) is an aviation unit of the United States Navy based at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California. The squadron flies the Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet and is currently assigned to Carrier Air Wing 11. Its callsign is Fist.

==Squadron insignia and nickname==
The squadron&#x27;s first insignia was approved by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) on 28 September 1944 and was indicative of its mission as a torpedo squadron, consisting of a four-leaf clover, horseshoe and flying torpedo.

A black fist clenching a red lightning bolt on a field of yellow became the squadron&#x27;s second insignia and has been in use, with some modifications, since CNO approval on 9 June 1949. The fist on the Insignia is actually Zeus&#x27; fist from Greek mythology.

On 24 July 1959, CNO approved a modification to the insignia which added a scroll with the designation VA-25.

On 24 January 1974 CNO approved another modification to the insignia, adding three black stars. When the squadron was designated VFA-25 it continued to use the fist and lightning bolt insignia but dropped the three stars. Four stars were again added (date unknown) representing wars in which VFA-25 has flown aircraft into combat: World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and most recently, Iraq.

==History==
Two US Navy squadrons have held the designation VA-25. The first VA-25 would eventually become VA-65 and is not related to the subject of this article. The second VA-25 has a direct lineage to the current VFA-25 &quot;Fist of the Fleet&quot;.

===1940s===

The squadron was originally commissioned as Torpedo Squadron 17 (VT-17) on 1 January 1943 at NAS Norfolk flying the Grumman TBF Avenger. On 10 September 1943 the squadron embarked on the aircraft carrier , en route from Norfolk to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii via the Panama Canal and San Diego, California. On 11 November 1943 the squadron flew its first combat sorties, striking targets in Rabaul. The squadron flew numerous combat missions through February 1944, striking targets in Kavieng, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, Truk and Tinian.

In February 1945, the squadron flew numerous combat missions against targets in Japan and the Bonin Islands and provided ground support for the Invasion of Iwo Jima. In March 1945, VT-17 aircraft struck Japanese ships in the East China Sea, Inland Sea and around the Ryukyu Islands and land based targets in and around Okinawa. 

On 7 April 1945, VT-17, along with other units from the task force, attacked a Japanese naval force composed of the super-battleship and her escorts, scoring several torpedo hits on &quot;Yamato&quot; and sinking one of her destroyer escorts. From April–June 1945, combat missions were flown against targets in and around Okinawa in preparation for the invasion of that island, targets in and around Kyushu, Shikoku and ships in the East China Sea.

In March 1946 the squadron transitioned to the SB2C Helldiver attack bomber, and was redesignated as VA-6B on 15 November 1946.

On 23 September 1947, the squadron transitioned to the AD-1 Skyraider, affectionately nicknamed the &quot;Spad,&quot; the type it would fly for the next 21 years.

The squadron sailed aboard on its maiden voyage in early 1948, and was redesignated as VA-65 on 27 July 1948.

From October 27 to November 23, 1949, VA-65 embarked on , to the Davis Straits area conducting cold weather exercises.

===1950s===

The outbreak of hostilities with which would become the Korean War saw the squadron transferred to NAS Moffett Field, California.

On 15 September 1950, embarked aboard , squadron aircraft participated in combat strikes against shore defenses in and around Incheon, Korea, just before the landings at Incheon. On 1 October 1950, VA-65 aircraft struck the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, hitting the airfield and scoring a direct hit on a large electrical power plant. On 23 June 1952, VA-65&#x27;s Skyraiders participated in the Attack on the Sui-ho Dam on the Yalu River.

In February 1955, while embarked on and operating in the Formosa Straits, the squadron provided air support during the evacuation of Nationalist Chinese forces from the Tachen Islands which had come under bombardment by the People’s Republic of China.

On 1 July 1959 the squadron was redesignated Attack Squadron Twenty-five (VA-25).

===1960s===
In March 1961, the squadron, while embarked on . operated in the South China Sea during the Laotian crisis.

In 1962, the squadron moved to its current home, the newly completed NAS Lemoore.

From April 1965 through 6 April 1968, the squadron made three deployments in support of the Vietnam War, still flying the A-1. During this period, squadron pilots flew over 3,000 combat missions, dropping more than 10 million pounds of ordnance on enemy targets. On 20 June 1965, four VA-25 &quot;Spads&quot; were engaged by two Vietnamese Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17s deep in North Vietnam — two of the squadron pilots were credited with a successful guns kill against one of the jet-powered fighters.
In January 1968, squadron aircraft provided close air support for U.S. Marines besieged at Khe Sanh, South Vietnam.

In October 1968, the squadron, by then the last tactical propeller driven squadron in the Navy, transitioned from the A-1 to the A-7 Corsair II. After only four months of training, the squadron returned to the Vietnam War aboard . It was during this cruise that the squadron set a record — in 33 flying days, pilots flew 1,650 sorties in combat, each averaging over 92 hours in the air.

===1970s===

In October 1970, the squadron began a long relationship with , nicknamed &quot;Top Gun.&quot; In the following two years, the squadron made two more combat cruises, expending over 15 million pounds of ordnance on targets in Laos and Vietnam. On 21 November 1970, squadron aircraft flew in support of Operation Ivory Coast, the attempt to free American prisoners of war from Son Tay, west of Hanoi. The squadron made four more deployments aboard &quot;Ranger&quot; in the 1970s.

In December 1972, the squadron participated in Operation Linebacker II, heavy air strikes against targets primarily around Hanoi and Haiphong.

On 15 January 1973, the squadron participated in a large laser-guided bombing attack against bridge targets in North Vietnam. This coordinated strike, led by VA-145, used the A-6 Intruder&#x27;s Pave Knife Laser Designation System to attack 14 North Vietnamese bridges with Mark 83 and Mark 84 laser-guided bombs dropped by the A-6A and A-7E aircraft.

Following the ceasefire with North Vietnam on 27 January 1973, the squadron concentrated its attention on strikes against lines-of-communication targets in Laos until an agreement was reached with that country.

In July 1976 following the Israeli raid on Entebbe, &quot;Ranger&quot;, with VA-25 embarked, was ordered to transit from the South China Sea to the western Indian Ocean and operate off the coast of Kenya.

===1980s===
VA-25 was on station in the Indian Ocean during the Iran hostage crisis.

In May 1984, the squadron began training in the F/A-18A Hornet. The squadron was redesignated as Strike Fighter Squadron 25 (VFA-25) on 1 July 1984.

Operational air wing training in multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground exercises with were conducted for the remainder of 1984 through January 1985. In February 1985, the squadron departed on the first deployment of the F/A-18 Hornet aboard USS &quot;Constellation&quot; to the western Pacific and Indian Ocean.

In July 1987 during the Iran–Iraq War, VFA-25 provided air cover for reflagged tankers transiting the Strait of Hormuz during Operation Earnest Will.

In June 1989, the squadron transitioned to the F/A-18C.

===1990s===
When Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the squadron operated from , flying combat patrols in support of Operation Desert Shield from the Gulf of Oman for three months before being relieved by .

In 1994, aboard the squadron operated extensively in the Persian Gulf, flying missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. In 1996, the squadron continued its participation in Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Strike. After being on station for more than three months, the squadron returned from deployment on November 12, 1996. In 1998, the squadron deployed on , where it enforced United Nations no-fly zones in Iraq.

===2000s===

In 2000, the squadron dropped several bombs on selected tactical targets in southern Iraq, and continued to patrol the skies in the Persian Gulf.

In July 2002, the squadron left NAS Lemoore for a regularly scheduled six-month deployment aboard &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, seeing action over Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom as well as over Iraq, in support of Operation Southern Watch. In late 2002, as the United States moved closer to military action against Iraq, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was ordered to stay on station in the Persian Gulf. After a total of three extensions and approaching the ship&#x27;s tenth month away from home, the Iraq War began.

On 19 March 2003, the squadron began combat sorties, participating in the first-night air strikes on Baghdad. The squadron sustained an average of 20 daily combat sorties, while striking targets in Basra, An Nasiriya, Al Kut, Najaf, Al Hillah and ultimately Baghdad. The squadron’s 272 combat sorties over 18 straight days struck the Iraqi regime’s Medina, Baghdad, and Nebuchadnezzar Armored Divisions, military airfields, facilities and command and control infrastructure. VFA-25 returned to the United States in May 2003.

VFA-25 deployed aboard in May 2004 to the Western Pacific, returning 1 November 2004.

From January to July 6, 2006, VFA-25 deployed with CVW-14 in support of the Iraq War and Valiant Shield aboard on her maiden voyage. In January 2007, VFA-25 deployed for a 3-month &quot;surge deployment&quot; to the U.S. Seventh Fleet Area of Operations. VFA-25 deployed again to the WESTPAC from June to November 2008.

On May 28, 2009, VFA-25 and Carrier Air Wing 14 deployed with USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; on a deployment to the 7th and 5th Fleet Areas of Responsibility.

In 2010, VFA-25 joined Carrier Air Wing Seventeen deployed aboard sporting the &quot;AA&quot; tailcode leaving Carrier Air Wing Fourteen and the &quot;NK&quot; tailcode for the first time in decades.

Following a successful combat deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2012, VFA-25 returned to NAS Lemoore to transition to the F/A-18E Super Hornet, completing the transition in late January 2013 and was reassigned to CVW-9.

In 2019, the Squadron deployed aboard as part of Carrier Air Wing 7 for the ship&#x27;s homeport change to San Diego.

In 2021, the squadron returned to a Pacific Fleet Carrier Air Wing, specifically Carrier Air Wing 11.

==In popular culture==

A version of the squadron patch and insignia (with the fictional squadron designation &quot;VF-213&quot;) was featured prominently in the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, worn by the character &quot;Ice Man&quot; portrayed by Val Kilmer. In reality, VFA-25 never operated the F-14 Tomcat, instead flying the F/A-18 Hornet during that period.

A t-shirt with the Top Gun version of the insignia was worn by Antonio the busboy in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season 2 episode “The Busboy”.

<text>William Plumer (June 25, 1759December 22, 1850) was an American lawyer, Baptist lay preacher, and politician from Epping, New Hampshire. He is most notable for his service as a Federalist in the United States Senate (1802–1807), and the seventh governor of New Hampshire as a Democratic-Republican (1812–1813, 1816–1819).

==Early life==
Plumer was born in Newburyport, Province of Massachusetts Bay on June 25, 1759, the son of farmer and merchant Samuel Plumer and Mary (Dole) Plumer. His family moved to Epping, New Hampshire, in 1768, and he was raised at his father&#x27;s farm on Epping&#x27;s Red Oak Hill. Plumer attended the Red Oak Hill School until he was 17.

Frequent ill health left him unsuited for military service during the American Revolution or life as a farmer, and after a religious conversion experience in his late teens, Plumer was trained as a Baptist exhorter (a lay preacher). For several years he traveled throughout the state to deliver sermons to Baptist churches and revival meetings. He briefly considered a career as a doctor, and began to study medicine. Later deciding on a legal career, he studied law with attorneys Joshua Atherton of Amherst and John Prentice of Londonderry. While studying under Atherton, his fellow law clerks included William Coleman, who remained a lifelong friend. Plumer attained admission to the bar in 1787, and began to practice in Epping.

==Early career==
In addition to practicing law, Plumer was active in local politics and government. He held several town offices, including selectman. Plumer served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 1785 to 1786, in 1788, from 1790 to 1791, and from 1797 to 1800. In 1791 and 1797 he served as Speaker of the House. Plumer was a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1791-1792.

==US Senate==
Plumer was elected to the US Senate as a Federalist and filled the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Sheafe. Plumer served from June 17, 1802, to March 3, 1807, and was not a candidate for re-election.

In 1803, Plumer was one of several New England Federalists to propose secession from the United States because of the lack of
power by Federalists, the rising influence of Jeffersonian Democrats, and the diminished influence of the North since the Louisiana Purchase. Recalling, in 1827, his involvement in the secession scheme, Plumer said, &quot;This was, I think, the greatest political error of my life: &amp; would, had it been reduced to practise [sic], instead of releiving [sic], destroyed New England... Fortunately for my own reputation the erroneous opinion I formed produced no bitter fruits to myself or my country.&quot;

==New Hampshire Senate==
Plumer served in the New Hampshire Senate in 1810 and 1811, and was chosen in both years to serve as the Senate&#x27;s president.

==Governor==
By now a Democratic-Republican, in 1812, Plumer was the party&#x27;s successful nominee for Governor of New Hampshire, and he served until 1813. He returned to office in 1816, and served until 1819.

==Presidential elector, 1820==
In the 1820 presidential election, Plumer was one of New Hampshire&#x27;s electoral college members. He cast the only dissenting vote in the Electoral College against incumbent President James Monroe, voting instead for John Quincy Adams. Some accounts say that it was to ensure that George Washington remained the only US president to be unanimously chosen by the Electoral College, but others assert that he was instead calling attention to his friend Adams as a potential future presidential candidate or was protesting against the &quot;wasteful extravagance&quot; of the Monroe administration. Plumer also eschewed voting for Daniel D. Tompkins for Vice President as &quot;grossly intemperate&quot; and having &quot;not that weight of character which his office requires&quot; and &quot;because he grossly neglected his duty&quot; in his &quot;only&quot; official role as president of the Senate by being &quot;absent nearly three-fourths of the time.&quot; Plumer instead voted for Richard Rush.

==Other activities==

Plumer was a founder and the first president of the New Hampshire Historical Society. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.

==Death and burial==
Plumer died in Epping on December 22, 1850, and was buried at the Plumer Family Cemetery in Epping.

==Family==

In 1788, Plumer married Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Fowler of Newmarket, New Hampshire. They were the parents of six children—William, Sally, Samuel, George Washington, John Jay, and Quintus. William Plumer Jr. was an author and attorney who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825.

<doc id="1223344" wikidata="Q1386948" url="?curid=1223344" title="Norman Whitfield">
<text>Norman Jesse Whitfield (May 12, 1940 – September 16, 2008) was an American songwriter, composer, and producer, who worked with Berry Gordy&#x27;s Motown labels during the 1960s. He has been credited as one of the creators of the Motown Sound and of the late-1960s subgenre of psychedelic soul.

During his 25-year career, Whitfield co-wrote and produced many enduring hits for Motown artists, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;, &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot;, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Next to You&quot;, &quot;War&quot;, &quot;Ball of Confusion (That&#x27;s What the World Is Today)&quot;, &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot;, &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot;, and &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;. Whitfield worked extensively with the Temptations as a producer and songwriter, producing eight of their albums between 1969 and 1973. He then started his own label, Whitfield Records, in 1975, which yielded the Rose Royce hit &quot;Car Wash&quot;. Alongside his Motown lyrical collaborator Barrett Strong, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004. He wrote or co-wrote 61 hits on the UK charts and 92 on the US charts. In 2024, Whitfield was posthumously selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical excellence category. Whitfield was also inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life and education==

Whitfield was born and raised in Harlem, New York, and spent much of his teen years in local pool halls. In his late teens, he and his family moved to Detroit, Michigan, so that his father could join his sister and work in her husband&#x27;s chain of drug stores, Barthwell Drugs. He attended Northwestern High School.

==Career==
At 19, Whitfield began frequenting Motown&#x27;s Hitsville USA offices for a chance to work for the growing label. Founder Berry Gordy Jr. recognized Whitfield&#x27;s persistence and hired him for the quality control department, which determined which songs would or would not be released. Whitfield joined Motown&#x27;s in-house songwriting staff, co-writing the Marvin Gaye hit &quot;Pride &amp; Joy&quot;, the Marvelettes&#x27;s &quot;Too Many Fish in the Sea&quot; and the Velvelettes&#x27;s &quot;Needle in a Haystack&quot;. He took over Smokey Robinson&#x27;s role as the main producer for the Temptations in 1966, after his &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; performed better than Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Get Ready&quot; on the pop charts.

===The Temptations===

From 1963 to 1974, Whitfield produced virtually all of the Temptations&#x27; music, experimenting with sound effects and other production techniques. He found a songwriting collaborator in lyricist Barrett Strong, the performer on Motown&#x27;s first hit record, &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, and wrote material for the Temptations and other Motown artists such as Marvin Gaye and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, both of whom recorded Whitfield-produced hit versions of the Whitfield/Strong composition &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;. The Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips&#x27; version was the best-selling Motown single so far, but it was surpassed a year later by Gaye&#x27;s version. In 1969, Whitfield won three BMI Awards for the songs &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine,&quot; &quot;I Wish It Would Rain,&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re My Everything.&quot;

=== &quot;Psychedelic soul&quot; ===
After Temptations lead singer David Ruffin was replaced by Dennis Edwards in 1968, Whitfield moved the group into a harder, darker sound that featured a blend of psychedelic rock and funk heavily inspired by the work of Sly &amp; the Family Stone and Funkadelic. He added contemporary song topics, moving from love songs to the social issues of the time, such as war, poverty and politics. The first Temptations single to feature this new psychedelic soul style was &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; in late 1968, which earned Motown its first Grammy Award for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Performance by a Duo or Group, Vocal or Instrumental).

The psychedelic soul records Whitfield produced for the Temptations and other artists such as Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth experimented with and updated the Motown sound for the late-1960s. Longer songs, distorted guitars, multitracked drums, and inventive vocal arrangements became trademarks of Whitfield&#x27;s productions, and later of records produced by Motown staffers he coached, including Frank Wilson. But friction and antagonism grew between Whitfield and the Temptations; the group hated how Whitfield put more emphasis on the instrumentation instead of their vocals, and that he was writing fewer romantic ballads for them.

Whitfield often recorded notably different versions of songs with different artists in search of a hit, and did so successfully in the cases of Edwin Starr, with &quot;War&quot; (1970; originally recorded by the Temptations), and the Undisputed Truth, with &quot;Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot; (1971; also originally by the Temptations). &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; (1972) was done first by the Undisputed Truth, before Whitfield rerecorded the song with the Temptations for a longer, more definitive (and massively successful) version. The Temptations&#x27; version earned a second Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for Whitfield and the Temptations, and Whitfield and Strong shared the songwriters&#x27; award for Best Rhythm and Blues Song. The single&#x27;s instrumental B-side earned Whitfield and arranger Paul Riser a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance,

One of Whitfield&#x27;s last major hits at Motown was Yvonne Fair&#x27;s &quot;It Should Have Been Me&quot; (1975), a song he had written in 1963 and recorded originally with Kim Weston.

===Whitfield Records and later years===
In 1975, Whitfield left Motown, following its move from Detroit, to form his own label, Whitfield Records. His first act was the Undisputed Truth, whom he had convinced to leave Motown, followed by Rose Royce, Willie Hutch, Yvonne Fair, Nytro, Mammatapee and Junior Walker. The Undisputed Truth scored their second biggest hit in 1976 with the disco song &quot;You + Me = Love&quot;, their first single on Whitfield Records. Norman Whitfield had an international smash hit in 1976 with Rose Royce&#x27;s &quot;Car Wash&quot;, issued on MCA Records. Rose Royce (whose members were originally Edwin Starr&#x27;s backing band while at Motown) went on to record three more popular albums, and had two huge UK hits with &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot; (1977) and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1978), but could never top the success of &quot;Car Wash&quot;, which served as the theme song to the 1976 motion picture &quot;Car Wash.&quot; The &quot;Car Wash&quot; soundtrack won Whitfield a Grammy Award for Best Album of Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or a Television Special. He also composed the theme song for the 1977 motion picture &quot;Which Way Is Up?&quot;, performed by Stargard. He produced soul group Masterpiece in 1980.

In the early 1980s, Whitfield began working as a producer for Motown again, helming the Temptations&#x27; 1983 hit single &quot;Sail Away&quot; and the soundtrack to &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;.

On January 18, 2005, Whitfield pleaded guilty for failing to report royalty income he earned from 1995 to 1999 to the Internal Revenue Service. Facing charges of tax evasion on more than $2 million worth of income, he was sentenced to six months of house confinement and a $25,000 fine. He was not imprisoned because of health problems such as diabetes.

During his last months alive, Whitfield was bed-ridden at Los Angeles&#x27;s Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he underwent treatment for diabetes and other ailments. Whitfield fell into a coma, briefly improved, but eventually succumbed to diabetic complications. Whitfield died on September 16, 2008. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<text>TUI [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] (trading as TUI Group) is a German multinational leisure, travel and tourism company; it is the largest such company in the world. TUI is an acronym for &quot;Touristik Union International&quot; (&quot;Tourism Union International&quot;). TUI AG was known as Preussag AG until 1997 when the company changed its activities from mining to tourism. It is headquartered in Hanover, Germany, and trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Hanover Stock Exchange.

It fully or partially owns several travel agencies, hotel chains, cruise lines and retail shops as well as five European airlines. These activities involve the operation of 353 hotels with 275,144 beds and it allows its brand to be used for another 65 hotels operated by third parties. These hotels accommodate 21 million guests a year. It also operates 16 cruise ships under the TUI Cruises, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises and Marella Cruises brands, as well as a fleet of 134 aircraft.

==History==

===Foundation and early years===
The origins of the company lie in the industrial and transportation company Preussag AG, which was originally formed as a German mining company. It was incorporated on 9 October 1923, as &quot;Preußische Bergwerks- und Hütten-Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (Prussian Mine and Foundry Company). In 1927 it was merged with the Ruhr coal company, Hibernia AG, and electricity utility to become the &quot;Vereinigte Elektrizitäts und Bergwerks AG&quot; (VEBA AG) (United Electrical and Mining Company).

After the sale of Salzgitter AG and purchase of Hapag-Lloyd AG (the navigation and logistics company) in 1997, Preussag AG became a global enterprise in the service and leisure industry. At that time, Hapag-Lloyd held a 30% interest in the tourism conglomerate TUI (founded 1968), increased to 100% by 1999. In addition the company acquired 25% of Thomas Cook shares in 1997, which it doubled the following year. On 2 February 1999, the Carlson Leisure Group merged with Thomas Cook into a holding company owned by the German bank Westdeutsche Landesbank, Carlson Inc and Preussag. However, in mid-2000 Preussag acquired Thomas Cook&#x27;s rival Thomson Travel and was forced to sell its majority 50.1% stake in Thomas Cook by regulatory authorities. In 2002, Preussag renamed itself TUI AG.

TUI announced a merger of its travel division with the British tour operator First Choice in March 2007, which was approved by the European Commission on 4 June 2007, on the condition that the merged company sell Budget Travel in Ireland. TUI held a 55% stake in the new company, TUI Travel PLC, which began operations in September 2007.

In April 2008, Alexey Mordashov, who purchased his first shares in TUI Travel in autumn 2007, purchased additional TUI Travel shares under S-Group in order to expand TUI Travel into Eastern Europe and Russia.

Its logistics activities, concentrated in the shipping sector, were kept separate and bundled within Hapag-Lloyd AG. A majority stake in Hapag-Lloyd was sold to the &quot;Albert Ballin consortium&quot; of investors in March 2009 and a further stake was sold to Ballin in February 2012, as TUI worked to exit from the shipping business and to optimize its tourism business with expansion in Russia, China and India under Michael Frenzel. Prior to August 2010, John Fredriksen held the largest Norwegian privately held stake in TUI Travel and had a significant influence upon TUI Travel&#x27;s direction and strategy. As Alexey Mordashov through his S-Group Travel Holding increased his stake in TUI Travel to a stake larger than Fredriksen&#x27;s stake, the shipping business had to be sold.

In June 2014, the company announced it would fully merge with TUI Travel to create a united group with a value of $US9.7 billion. The merger was completed on 17 December 2014 and the combined business began trading on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges. Prior to this merger, Alexey Mordashov, the largest private shareholder in TUI Travel, held a blocking stake in TUI Travel through his S-Group. After the merger, Mordashov&#x27;s stake was reduced to less than a blocking stake of 25%. On 12 December 2016, Mordashov increased his stake in TUI Group from 18% to more than 20%. In October 2018, his 24.9% stake was the largest privately held stake in TUI Group. In June 2019, Mordashov transferred 65% of his stake to the KN-Holding, owned by his sons Kirill and Nikita Mordashov. TUI stated in a statement that they ”welcomed the second generation of the family amongst its shareholders”.

Berge &amp; Meer and Boomerang Reisen as well as Atraveo were sold to the holding company GENUI in 2019. At the end of 2019, the holiday home provider Wolters Reisen GmbH and the round trip specialist Wolters Rundreisen GmbH, of which TUI Group owned 100% of the shares via an investment company, were sold to the Frankfurt-based company e-domizil.

===Development since 2020===
In August 2020, the company reported a net loss of €2.3 billion (from October 2019 to June 2020) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of the sum, €1.5 billion loss related to the period from April to June 2020, while the revenue for the same period was €75 million, 98% less than the same period in 2019. TUI&#x27;s chief executive officer, Fritz Joussen announced that the firm was considering selling the Marella cruise line.

In March 2022, the company&#x27;s largest single shareholder, Alexey Mordashov, a Russian oligarch and confidante of Vladimir Putin, was placed under sanctions due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In March 2023, it was announced that TUI would seek to raise $1.8 billion by selling shares at a discount to existing investors, excluding Mordashov as a result of sanctions under German securities law.

==Corporate affairs==
===Governance===
The following people have served in key roles:
===Shareholders===
The company&#x27;s shares are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, as well as the Hanover Stock Exchange.

In spring 2007, the Norwegian shipowner and financial investor John Fredriksen acquired a 15.01% stake in TUI. At TUI&#x27;s AGM in May 2008, Fredriksen demanded a split-up of the group and the dismissal of TUI CEO Michael Frenzel. At the AGM on 13 May 2009, Fredriksen demanded that Supervisory Board Chairman Jürgen Krumnow be voted out of office so that he could then join the Supervisory Board himself. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. On 28 February 2014, Monteray Enterprises Ltd (John Fredriksen) notified TUI that its share of voting rights in TUI had fallen below the 3% thresholds on 24 February 2014.

Russian oligarch Alexei Mordashov joined TUI at the beginning of 2008. By July 2008, he had increased his stake to 15.03% and in March 2012 to 25.29%, and later to 34%. He was thus the largest single shareholder. Mordashov has been on the EU sanctions list since 28 February 2022 and, according to a corresponding voting rights notification, transferred control of most of his indirectly held shares to the Virgin Islands-based company Ondero Limited, controlled by Marina Mordashova, on that date. Due to an investigation by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection regarding the transfer of the shares to Ondero Limited, the transfer is suspended. The shareholding in TUI AG therefore continues to be held (indirectly) by Mordashov. Due to the capital increase in spring 2023, in which Mordashov was not allowed to participate due to his sanction, his shareholding has meanwhile decreased significantly. According to the voting rights notifications of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of 16 May 2023, 10.87% shares in TUI AG have been indirectly attributable to Mordashov since 19 April 2023, while Marina Mordashowa holds 0% in TUI AG.

In February 2024, the company decided to leave the London Stock Exchange retaining its listings on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange.

===Business figures===
The key indicators of the TUI Group are (as at the financial year ending 30 September):
== Operations ==
=== Accommodation ===
In the 2022 financial year, the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment comprised a total of 353 hotels with 275,144 beds. With 322 properties, the majority are four- or five-star hotels. 53% were operated under management contracts, 38% were owned by the respective hotel company, 8% were leased and 1% of the facilities were operated under franchise agreements. In addition, 65 hotels were operated by third-party hoteliers under TUI&#x27;s international concept brands as at 30 September 2022, bringing the total number including third-party hotels to 418.

=== Cruises ===
TUI&#x27;s cruise segment operates a total of 16 cruise ships under three brands:
* TUI Cruises is a joint venture with Royal Caribbean Cruises. The fleet currently comprises seven ships named Mein Schiff 1 to 7.

* Hapag-Lloyd Cruises is responsible for luxury and expedition cruises in German-speaking countries. The brand was transferred to TUI Cruises in 2020. With the MS Europa and the MS Europa 2, the group offers luxury cruises; the two ships were the only cruise ships worldwide to be awarded the 5-star-plus category by the Berlitz Cruise Guide. HEANSEATIC class expedition ships include the HANSEATIC nature, the HANSEATIC inspiration and the HANSEATIC spirit.

* Marella Cruises offers cruises with four ships, primarily in the UK market.

=== Airlines ===
TUI owns several airlines operating under the brands &quot;TUI fly&quot; and &quot;TUI Airways&quot; which are managed by TUI Airline Management.

==Controversies==
*On 16 April 2009, TUI Travel and S-Group Travel Holding of the Russian shareholder Alexey Mordashov declared the formation of a joint venture in Russia with investments of 30 million euros to develop tourism activities in Russia and Ukraine. The intention was to take over the tour operators VKO Group and Mostravel in Russia and Voyage Kiev in Ukraine, which had over 160 travel agencies and over half a million customers. In March 2022, TUI AG terminated the brand use agreement with TUI Russia; TUI Russia is no longer a TUI Group company. The last shares in TUI Russia were sold in 2021. In May 2022, it was reported that the major stakeholder and Russian oligarch Alexei Mordashov had made a transfer of a holding of 29.9% of the company: TUI failed to follow the rules and verify the new owner of the shares. In addition, the transfer was a violation of the sanctions against Russia by the European Union, which sanctioned Mordashov personally.

*A 2018 study in the UK found that Tui had the largest gender pay gap reported to date by a major UK company, with its male employees paid more than twice what female employees are paid.

*TUI has become the main airline carrying out charter deportation flights for the UK Home Office. It is estimated that in November and December 2020 TUI carried out the deportation of more than 150 people in 13 flights to 23 destinations for the Home Office.

*On 20 May 2022, the German TV Programme ZDF-Magazin Royale dedicated an episode to the history of TUI. It reported that Preussag was active in World War II producing bombs for the Nazi Party. Later Preussag also provided chemicals to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s in Iraq, so facilitating the development of chemical weapons. The company were also supportive of the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and helped to build a factory for the production of chemical bombs. The management responded to a request for information, by saying that they were not aware of the company&#x27;s history.

<doc id="1223355" wikidata="Q2341208" url="?curid=1223355" title="Rhizocephala">
<text>Rhizocephala are derived barnacles that are parasitic castrators. Their hosts are mostly decapod crustaceans, but include Peracarida, mantis shrimps and thoracican barnacles. Their habitats range from the deep ocean to freshwater. Together with their sister groups Thoracica and Acrothoracica, they make up the subclass Cirripedia. Their body plan is uniquely reduced in an extreme adaptation to their parasitic lifestyle, and makes their relationship to other barnacles unrecognisable in the adult form. The name Rhizocephala derives from the Ancient Greek roots (, &quot;root&quot;) and (, &quot;head&quot;), describing the adult female, which mostly consists of a network of thread-like extensions penetrating the body of the host.

== Description ==

=== Adults ===

Adult rhizocephalans lack appendages, segmentation, and all internal organs except gonads, a few muscles, and the remains of the nervous system. Females have a cuticle, which is never shed. Other than the minute larval stages, there is nothing identifying them as crustaceans or even arthropods in general. The only distinguishable portion of a rhizocephalan body is the externa: the reproductive portion of adult females.

=== Nauplius and cypris larvae ===

Nauplii released from adult females swim in water for several days without taking food (the larva has no mouth and no intestine) and transform into cypris larvae (cyprids) after several moults. Like the nauplii, the cyprids are lecithotrophic (non-feeding). 

=== Parasitism ===

The female cypris larva in Kentrogonida settles on a host and metamorphoses into a specialized juvenile form, a kentrogon. This has no visible segmentation and no appendages except the antennules. These are used to attach the larva to the host; their only purpose is to inject a cell mass, the vermigon, into the host&#x27;s hemolymph through a retractive hollow stylet on the larva&#x27;s head. The kentrogon stage seems to have been secondarily lost in all of the Akentrogonida, where the cypris injects the vermigon through one of its antennules. The vermigon grows into a network of root-like threads through the host&#x27;s tissue, centering on the digestive system and especially the hepatopancreas, and absorb nutrients from the hemolymph. The network of threads is called the interna. The female then grows a sac-like externa, which consists of a mantle, a mantle cavity, an ovary and a pair of passageways known as cell receptacles, extruding from the abdomen of the host.

In the order Kentrogonida, the virgin externa contains no openings at first. But it soon molts to a second stage that contains an orifice known as the mantle departure, and which leads into the two receptacle passageways — once assumed to be the testes in hermaphroditic parasites before the realization that they were actually two separate sexes — and starts releasing pheromones to attract male cyprids. From inside the body of the male cypris that succeeds in entering the departure, a unique and very short lived male stage called the trichogen emerges through the antennule opening. It is the homologue of the female kentrogon, but is reduced to an amoeboid unsegmented cuticle-covered mass of cells consisting of three to four cell-types: the dorsolateral, the ventral epidermis, the inclusion cells, and the postganglion. The externa have room for two males, one for each of the receptacles, which increase the heterozygosity of the offspring. Once inside, the trichogen will shed its cuticle before reaching the end of the passageway.

In the order Akentrogonida, which form a monophyletic group nested within the paraphyletic Kentrogonida, the male does not develop into a trichogon, and the cypris injects its cell mass through its antennule and directly into the body of the immature externa. The offspring also hatch directly into fully developed cyprids instead of nauplius larvae (except for a few species of kentrogonid rhizocephalans, which hatch into cyprids like the akentrogonids, the kentrogonids have kept their nauplius stage). In species like &quot;Clistosaccus paguri&quot;, the male injects its cluster of cells which migrates through the connective tissue of the mantle and into the receptacle. But in forms like &quot;Sylon hippolytes&quot; the receptacle is absent, and the males cells implant in the ovary instead. While only a single male can settle in each receptacle, which is the rule in Kentrogonida, the number of implanted males in Akentrogonida can range from just one to more than ten.

=== Reproduction ===

The small cluster of cells injected by the male cypris differentiates into a loosely connected mass of sperm-producing germ cells, once it reaches its destination inside the female. Being nothing more than sperm-forming cells, these adult male rhizocephalans represent the simplest form of male in the entire animal kingdom. Mature female externa releases eggs into its mantle cavity where eggs are fertilised by sperm from the hyper-parasitic male(s). Due to the larval sexual dimorphism in the Kentrogonida, the females produce two different egg sizes; small female eggs and larger male eggs. It appears the sex determination in Akentrogonida is environmental.

In &quot;Peltogasterella gracilis&quot;, the externa produces several batches of larvae before it drops off the host, taking the male(s) inside with it. After the original externa disappear, the host moults and the interna grows buds that each develops into a new virgin externa. The females commonly has two cypris cell receptacles. With more than one externa, and new ones replacing the old ones, each female Peltogasterella can receive sperm from numerous males during her lifetime.

The externa is where the host&#x27;s egg sac would be, and the host&#x27;s behaviour is chemically altered: it is castrated and does not moult until the aged externa drops off. The host treats the externa as if it were its own egg sac. This behaviour even extends to male hosts, which would never have carried eggs, but care for the externa in the same way as females.

== Classification ==

Following an updated classification of barnacles by Chan et al. (2021), the subgroups Akentrogonida and Kentrogonida were dropped, leaving 13 families as children of the infraclass Rhizocephala.
* Family Chthamalophilidae 
* Family Clistosaccidae 
* Family Duplorbidae 
* Family Mycetomorphidae 
* Family Parthenopeidae 
* Family Peltogasterellidae 
* Family Peltogastridae 
* Family Pirusaccidae 
* Family Polyascidae 
* Family Polysaccidae 
* Family Sacculinidae 
* Family Thompsoniidae 
* Family Triangulidae

<text>That Was Then... This Is Now is a 1985 American drama film based on the novel of the same name by S. E. Hinton. The film was directed by Christopher Cain, distributed by Paramount Pictures, and stars Emilio Estevez (who also wrote the screenplay) and Craig Sheffer.

==Synopsis==
Troubled teen Mark Jennings has always looked up to his older friend, Bryon Douglas, who Mark sees as the older brother he never had. But when Bryon starts dating Cathy Carlson and begins to act more responsible, Mark feels left out. Without Bryon&#x27;s stabilizing influence, Mark begins acting out and gets into dealing drugs.

==Production==
In 1982, Emilo Estevez co-starred in the film version of S.E. Hinton&#x27;s &quot;Tex&quot;. During filming, Estevez read &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot;, also by Hinton, and enjoyed the book so much he drafted several screenplays before purchasing the rights. Estevez described the book as &quot;a very intense, dark piece. It&#x27;s kind of like the old Pat O&#x27;Brien-Jimmy Cagney movies where O&#x27;Brien becomes the priest and Cagney becomes the gangster&quot;. Estevez did a rewrite of the film during the making of &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, staying up all night to write after the typical 12 hour filming day. After speaking with Hinton, who recommended he also play one of the characters, Estevez attempted to sell the screenplay, but studios were reluctant.

Estevez&#x27; father Martin Sheen bought the rights to &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; in 1982. &quot;I knew it would be hot&quot;, said Estevez of the novel, who said in 1983 he wanted to star along with Tom Cruise. Estevez found two Midwest producers interested in making the film and they succeeded in raising the finance. One of them, Gary Lindberg, ran a production company that mostly made TV commercials, based in Minnesota. The film was shot in the summer of 1984 in St. Paul, Minnesota, without a distributor. It was later advertised as &quot;the first Minnesota movie&quot;.

Sheen recommended his son play Bryon Douglas, but Estevez, wary of being typecast, chose to play what he saw as the &quot;sympathetic bad guy&quot;. Estevez said: &quot;There&#x27;s probably a lot of him in me, the alter ego screaming to get out every once in a while. Fortunately, I was able to vent it in a film and not in real life&quot;.

Estevez said that they have been able to learn from the other Hinton adaptations: &quot;We made it very contemporary, hired a brilliant cinematographer. The cast is primarily unknowns so it has a real feel – you&#x27;re not watching movie stars. The emotional content is so rich, so full, it&#x27;s absolutely draining. It&#x27;s a terrific movie&quot;.

==Reception==
The film opened November 8, 1985 and finished sixth place for the weekend with a gross of $2,502,780, behind other openers such as &quot;Target&quot; and &quot;Translyvania 6-5000&quot;. It was a minor success at the box office, grossing $8.6 million.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 0% rating based on 5 reviews. On Metacritic it has a score of 45% based on reviews from 6 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

==Home Media==
&quot;That Was Then... This Is Now&quot; was released on VHS by Paramount Home Video in 1986.

<text>The International School Bangkok (ISB; , ) is a private PK-12 American-style school in the Pak Kret District of Nonthaburi Province, Thailand in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in the United States. ISB was the first school in Thailand to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program (DP). 

== History ==
===Foundation===
ISB first opened as the International Children&#x27;s Center on the grounds of the U.S. Embassy Bangkok in 1951. It was the first international school to open in Thailand and serviced U.S. Embassy families and other expatriates in Bangkok at the time. Its initial enrollment was 50 children of United Nations and U.S. diplomats. First located on Rajadamri Road, it was known as the International Children&#x27;s Center (ICC). ISB then expanded to provide both primary and secondary education for English-speaking children in Bangkok. In 1960, ISB moved from the U.S. Embassy-owned grounds to Sukhumvit Soi 15. A few years later, ISB opened a second campus on Viphavadi Rangsit road, but it closed in the mid-1970s with the American drawdown from Vietnam. Finally in 1992, ISB was relocated from Soi 15 to the present US$25-million campus in the Pak Kret District, Nonthaburi Province, within Nichada Thani as &quot;campus town&quot;; on a land that it owns and maintains itself, and that consists of a separate elementary, middle, and high schools interwoven into one Thai-style complex. ISB has students from over 50 countries enrolled.

Parents oversee the operation of ISB, which is a non-profit and non-sectarian school. Parents are members of the school association and elect the governing board of ISB.

<doc id="1223365" wikidata="Q765443" url="?curid=1223365" title="Laminal consonant">
<text>A laminal consonant is a phone (speech sound) produced by obstructing the air passage with the blade of the tongue, the flat top front surface just behind the tip of the tongue, in contact
with upper lip, teeth, alveolar ridge, to possibly, as far back as the
prepalatal arch, although in the last contact may involve parts behind the blade as well. It is distinct from an apical consonant, produced by creating an obstruction with the tongue apex (tongue tip) only.
Sometimes laminal is used exclusively for an articulation that involves only the blade of the tongue with the tip being lowered and apicolaminal for an articulation that involves both the blade of the tongue and the raised tongue tip.
The distinction applies only to coronal consonants, which use the front of the tongue.

==Compared to apical==
Some languages contrast laminal and apical sounds:
*The contrast is common in Australian Aboriginal languages, which usually have no fricatives.
*Some languages in South Asia contrast apical and laminal stops. In Hindustani, the apical stops are normally called &quot;retroflex&quot; but are really alveolar or postalveolar. Malayalam has a three-way distinction between laminal dental, apical alveolar and true subapical retroflex in nasal and voiceless oral stops.
*Basque and Mirandese differentiate between laminal and apical sibilants in the alveolar region; Mandarin Chinese, Serbo-Croatian, and Polish make such a distinction with postalveolar consonants.
*Some native languages of California have the distinction in both stops and fricatives.
*Dahalo makes the distinction only in its stops.

Because laminal consonants use the flat of the tongue, they cover a broader area of contact than apical consonants. Laminal consonants in some languages have been recorded with a broad occlusion (closure) that covers all the front of the mouth from the hard palate to the teeth, which makes it difficult to compare the two. Alveolar laminals and apicals are two different articulations.

A very common laminal articulation is sometimes called denti-alveolar. It spans the alveolar ridge to the teeth but is a little farther forward than other alveolar laminal consonants, which cover more of the alveolar ridge and might be considered postalveolar. This occurs in French.

==Compared to alveolar==
Part of the confusion in naming laminal consonants is quite literally a matter of point of view. When one looks at a person pronouncing a laminal alveolar or denti-alveolar, the tip of the tongue can be seen touching the back of the teeth or even protruding between the teeth, which gives them the common name of dental.

Acoustically, however, the important element is the place of the rearmost occlusion, which is the point that the resonant chamber in the mouth terminates. That determines the size, shape and acoustics of the oral cavity, which produces the harmonics of the vowels. Thus, French coronals are alveolar and differ from English alveolars primarily in being laminal rather than apical (in French, the tongue is flatter).

There are true laminal dentals in some languages with no alveolar contact, such as in Hindustani, which are different from French consonants. Nevertheless, the breadth of contact has some importance; it influences the shape of the tongue farther back and so the shape of the resonant cavity. Also, if the release of a denti-alveolar consonant is not abrupt, the tongue may peel off from the roof of the mouth from back to front and so shift from an alveolar to a dental pronunciation.

In the IPA, the diacritic for laminal consonants is .

<text>An apical consonant is a phone (speech sound) produced by obstructing the air passage with the tip of the tongue (apex) in conjunction with upper articulators from lips to postalveolar, and possibly prepalatal. It contrasts with laminal consonants, which are produced by creating an obstruction with the blade of the tongue, just behind the tip. Sometimes &quot;apical&quot; is used exclusively for an articulation that involves only the tip of the tongue and &quot;apicolaminal&quot; for an articulation that involves both the tip and the blade of the tongue. However, the distinction is not always made and the latter one may be called simply &quot;apical&quot;, especially when describing an apical dental articulation. As there is some laminal contact in the alveolar region, the apicolaminal dental consonants are also labelled as &quot;denti-alveolar&quot;.

It is not a very common distinction and is typically applied only to fricatives and affricates. Thus, many varieties of English have either apical or laminal pairs of (although the plosives , nasals and lateral tend to be apical, while the fricatives tend to be laminal). However, some varieties of Arabic, including Hadhrami Arabic in Yemen, realize as laminal but as apical.

Basque uses the distinction for alveolar fricatives. Mandarin Chinese uses it for postalveolar fricatives (the &quot;alveolo-palatal&quot; and &quot;retroflex&quot; series). Lillooet uses it as a secondary feature in contrasting velarized and non-velarized affricates. A distinction between apical and laminal is common in Australian Aboriginal languages for nasals, plosives and (usually) lateral approximants.

Most dialects in the Bengali–Assamese continuum distinguish between dental–laminal alveolar stops and apical alveolar stops. In Upper Assamese, they have merged and leave only the apical alveolar stops. In Western Bengali apical alveolars are replaced by apical post-alveolars.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, the diacritic for apical consonants is .

She was selected and purchased for Roy and Patricia Chapman by trainer Bob Camac for $40,000 at the 1993 Keeneland September yearling sale.

Trained by Camac, I&#x27;ll Get along was a stakes winner of $277,009 but is best known as a broodmare through her mating to Elusive Quality that produced Smarty Jones, the 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner who was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse honors.

In 2004, I&#x27;ll Get Along was sold for $5,000,000 to Gaines-Gentry Thoroughbreds, then in foal with an Elusive Quality filly. At Coolmore Stud in Ireland, she was bred to Champion sire, Sadler&#x27;s Wells. She has since produced a second stakes winner, the turf sprinter filly Smartys Emperoress by Holy Roman Emperor.

<text>The Samoa men&#x27;s national association football team () represents Samoa in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Football Federation Samoa, the governing body for football in Samoa. Samoa&#x27;s home ground is Toleafoa J. S. Blatter Soccer Stadium in Apia. It was known as the Western Samoa national football team until 1997.

==History==

===Beginnings (1979–1993)===
Although they had not taken part in the first five editions of the South Pacific Games, their geographical proximity to Fiji, host of 1979 South Pacific Games, allowed them to participate for the first time. They lost both group stage matches to Wallis and Futuna 3–1 and Solomon Islands 12–0. Four years later, as hosts of the 1983 edition, they beat American Samoa 3–1, drew 3–3 with Tonga and fell again to Wallis and Futuna, but the results allowed them to advance to the next round. In the quarterfinals, Tahiti eliminated them by beating them 2–0.

Samoa entered qualification for the 1988 Summer Olympics however they were defeated by New Zealand over two legs, losing 7–0 at home before being defeated 12–0 in Auckland. In the playoffs for the next round, Samoa lost to Chinese Taipei 5–0 and were eliminated.

===Regional Frustrations (1994–2010)===

In 1994 they hosted the first edition of the Polynesia Cup, where they beat American Samoa, tied with Tonga and lost to Tahiti to finish in third position. In 1998 they were third again, coming within a point of the Cook Islands in second. Samoa returned to finish third again in the 2000 edition by beating Tonga and American Samoa, but losing to the Cook Islands and Tahiti.

After four tournaments absent, they returned in the 2007 South Pacific Games as hosts. They managed six points by beating Tonga and American Samoa again, but were eliminated after losing to the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

===OFC Nations Cup (2011–present) ===

In 2011, they hosted the OFC Nations Cup qualifying tournament. There, they beat the Cook Islands 3–2, drew 1–1 with Tonga and defeated American Samoa 1–0 to qualify for the first time in their history. At the championship proper, they were beaten 10–1 by Tahiti, 5–0 by Vanuatu and 9–0 by New Caledonia.

In the 2016 qualifiers, they beat American Samoa 3–2 and lost 1–0 to the Cook Islands. In their final game, the Samoan team defeated Tonga 3–0 and qualified on goal difference, because of American Samoa&#x27;s 2–0 win over the Cookian team. At the tournament, which took place in Papua New Guinea, the Samoan team lost 4–0 to Tahiti, 7–0 to New Caledonia and 8–0 to the local team. Therefore, they finished in last place in their group without a single point.

During 2024 qualifying, Samoa qualified for the final tournament after a 4-1 win over Tonga, and a 1-0 win against Cook Islands. Samoa were then eliminated from the 2024 OFC Men&#x27;s Nations Cup after a 2-0 defeat to Tahiti, a 9-1 defeat against co-hosts Fiji, and a 2-1 defeat against Papua New Guinea; this ensured their elimination as Samoa placed fourth in Group B after conceding thirteen goals without a single point.

<text>Lê Văn Tống (September 1, 1945 – April 5, 2019), known as Lý Tống, was a Vietnamese American aviator and anti-communist activist.

==Early life==
Ly Tong was born on September 1, 1945 to a family of 9 brothers. His father, Lê Văn Tấn was a farmer who was killed during the First Indochina war when Ly Tong was 2 years old. 

In the early years of his life, he studied at An Cựu Primary School in South Vietnam, and then transferred to Nguyen Tri Phuong High School. In 1962, Ly Tong finished middle school, and in 1963 he studied at Huế National School.

==Military career==

In 1965, at the age of 19, he joined the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. From January 1965 to December 1965, Tong studied at the Air Force Training Center in Nha Trang. While at Nha Trang, he received a notice to study in the United States. In January 1970, he was assigned to the &quot;Black Eagle&quot; Fighter Squadron of 4th Air Force Division, at the city of Cần Thơ, where he trained to fly the Cessna U-17 and A-37 Dragonfly. During this time, Ly Tong fought mainly in the Cambodian campaign and in battles at the southwestern region of Vietnam.

In early 1973, Ly Tong was transferred to the 548 Squadron in Phan Rang. During this period, he continued his training to fly A-37 in bombing, reconnaissance, guided air strikes and scouting missions. He mainly fought in the battlefield at the Central Highlands.

===Prisoner and subsequent escape===
In April 1975, while flying an attack mission against North Vietnamese targets, his A-37 was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The same month, the city of Saigon was captured by the North Vietnamese Army, which marked the end of the Vietnam War and the fall of South Vietnam.

After being captured, he was held in a re-education camp for five years. In August 1980, while interned at a re-education camp in Tuy Hoa, he fled to Ho Chi Minh City where he lived illegally. During this time, Ly Tong met with people who specialized in making forged documents. With fake identity documents, he fled Vietnam by crossing the border by land to Cambodia and subsequently arrived in Thailand by bike, bus, train and on foot. He eventually swam at night across the Johor Strait to Singapore, hailed a cab and arrived at the United States Embassy in Singapore to request political asylum.

In 1984, Ly was granted asylum in the United States and received a letter from then-President Ronald Reagan commending him for his struggle to attain freedom from captivity in Vietnam. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in political science at the University of New Orleans and wrote a novel in Vietnamese. He became good friends with former Republic of Vietnam Air Force Colonel An Vo. He also played a large role in the Vietnamese community in New Orleans. However, there were claims from the Vietnamese government that Ly Tong was unemployed during his time in America and conducted an insurance scam.

==Anti-communist activism ==
In the 1990s he decided to take up anti-communist activities, and in 1992, he hijacked a Vietnam Airlines airliner. Ly Tong&#x27;s copilot claimed that he was forced to fly over Ho Chi Minh City so that Ly Tong could drop thousands of leaflets calling for insurrection against the communist government of Vietnam. He parachuted and jumped from the plane, but he landed in a swamp and was apprehended by Vietnamese soldiers and sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment. In 1998 the Vietnamese government released him as part of an amnesty program along with other democracy activists. Colonel An Vo from New Orleans is said to have gone back to help him become free.

On January 1, 2000, he flew over Havana, Cuba, and dropped leaflets encouraging the Cuban people to rise up and revolt against the government of Fidel Castro. On his return to Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport in Florida, he was detained and questioned by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but was released without charges. The Federal Aviation Administration suspended his pilots&#x27; license. On his return to Florida, he was hailed a hero by some Cuban-Americans and there was a return parade for his flight over Cuba.

On November 17, 2000, Ly Tong and a copilot flew to Thailand, from where he flew to drop 50,000 pamphlets calling for armed demonstrations against the communist government of Vietnam over Ho Chi Minh City. The leaflet-dropping coincided with a visit to Vietnam by then-U.S. President Bill Clinton. After landing, he was arrested by Thai authorities. In December 2004, the Vietnamese government sent an extradition request to Thailand, accusing Tong of slandering the Government of Vietnam and violating the territorial security of Vietnam. The Thai lower court did not consider the slander charge, deeming it a political offense, but ruled there was sufficient reason to extradite Tong. In 2006, Tong was released by the Thai government and returned to the United States. The decision to extradite Tong to Vietnam was overturned by Thai appeals court after it ruled that Tong&#x27;s act was a political offense, rather than a criminal one.

On August 26, 2008, Ly Tong rented a plane and pilot for travel. But a short time after taking off, Tong told the pilot to fly the airplane over North Korea so that he could spread anti-communist leaflets to the North Koreans. The pilot told him that due to the lack of fuel they had to return to Seoul to refill, whilst sending an emergency hijacking signal to the airport authorities. Upon landing, Tong was arrested and briefly detained by the airport authorities.

He was arrested again in July 2010 for a pepper spray assault on Vietnamese singer Dam Vinh Hung at a concert in Santa Clara, California. Tong accused the singer of being a communist agent. Security was tight, as people figured there would be an assault against the singer. Ly Tong dressed up in drag to escape security and pepper spray the singer in the face as he was being handed a flower on stage. He was convicted of two misdemeanors—simple assault and resisting arrest—and two felonies, including using tear gas and second-degree burglary with the intent to commit a felony. On June 22, 2012, he was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 3 years probation.

==Later life and death ==
In February through March 2008, he conducted a hunger strike at San Jose City Hall, protesting efforts by city councilwoman Madison Nguyen to name a district of the city &quot;New Saigon Business District&quot; instead of &quot;Little Saigon&quot;.

Tong died of lung cancer on April 5, 2019, at Sharp Memorial Hospital, in San Diego, California. His funeral was attended by mourners from the Vietnamese American community in Westminster, California. He is buried at the Westminster Memorial Park.

<text>The Communist Party of Iceland () was a Marxist–Leninist communist party in Iceland from 1930 to 1938.

== History ==
In the early 1920s, a group of young militants of the Social Democratic Party () came into contact with the international communist movement. Their ideology, and that of their party leader, was quickly growing apart. The communists formed a radical section within the party which they called the &quot;Association of Young Communists&quot; () in November 1922. The group evolved into the &quot;Sparta Association of Socialists&quot; () in 1926, but they eventually left the social democrats to form their own party as suggested by Comintern in 1928. The Communist Party of Iceland (KFI) was formed in November 1930 and became a member of Comintern. KFI published .

In 1938, another splinter group, which had left the social democrats the year before, unified itself with the communists forming the Popular Unity Party - Socialist Party (). The new party did not continue the Comintern membership. However, the communists were dominant in the party and it was mostly the same as its predecessor. In 1956 the Socialist Party formed the People&#x27;s Alliance as an electoral alliance with yet another splinter group from the Social Democratic Party. The People&#x27;s Alliance became a political party in 1968.

<doc id="1223386" wikidata="Q629570" url="?curid=1223386" title="Nowhere (1997 film)">
<text>Nowhere is a 1997 black comedy drama film written and directed by Gregg Araki. Described by Araki as &quot;&quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; on acid&quot;, the film follows a day in the lives of a group of Los Angeles college students and the strange lives that they lead. It stars an ensemble cast led by James Duval and Rachel True.

The film is Araki&#x27;s sixth overall and third entry in his &quot;Teenage Apocalypse&quot; film trilogy, preceded by &quot;Totally F***ed Up&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; (1995). Like the other films in the trilogy, it contains scenes of graphic violence and sexuality. The film notably includes several cast members on the verge of stardom, including Ryan Phillippe, Mena Suvari, Kathleen Robertson, and Denise Richards.

Initial reception was mixed, though in subsequent years it has garnered a cult status and its reputation among critics has grown.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles, Dark and Mel are a bisexual couple in an open relationship. Mel is dating a girl named Lucifer, whom Dark hates, while Dark is interested in a mysterious boy he keeps running into, named Montgomery. The three of them meet up at a café they frequent, where they encounter other teenagers they know, such as Alyssa, Dingbat and Egg and Dark&#x27;s friend Cowboy, and they discuss a party being held that night by a man they know named Jujyfruit. Egg runs into an unnamed TV star from &quot;Baywatch&quot; (played by &quot;Baywatch&quot; actor Jaason Simmons).

Cowboy tells Dark about his boyfriend Bart&#x27;s heroin addiction. He offers Bart the chance to fix their relationship if he stops using drugs, but he declines. Alyssa and Dingbat meet with Ducky, Egg&#x27;s brother and Dingbat&#x27;s crush, before Alyssa meets up with her boyfriend Elvis. While waiting at a bus stop, Dark witnesses three valley girls killed by an alien, which he tries to catch on video before it disappears.

At the &quot;Baywatch&quot; star&#x27;s place, he and Egg watch TV together before he tries to make a move on her. She rejects his advances, and he violently rapes her. Dark and his friends play a drug-induced game of kick the can, during which Montgomery gets abducted by the same alien from earlier, whom Dark runs into in a locker room. Egg and Bart both return home and watch the same televangelist, Moses Helper, on TV, who encourages the two to commit suicide in order to reach heaven.

When he fails to convince Mel to become monogamous at Jujyfruit&#x27;s party, Dark goes outside and is joined by Dingbat. Suddenly, Ducky, after hearing about his sister&#x27;s suicide, leaps into a swimming pool, with Dingbat performing CPR on him. Going back into the party, Dark enters a kitchen where he sees the same alien from earlier. He meets with Handjob and begins to tell him about his day before Alyssa and Elvis arrive. Elvis claims Handjob sold him bad drugs and beats him to death with a can of tomato soup.

Dark returns home and records a diary entry on his video camera, saying how he is &quot;totally doomed&quot;. As he attempts to sleep, Montgomery knocks on his window. Dark lets him in as he explains that he was abducted and experimented on by aliens who intend to invade Earth. The two lie down in bed together and Montgomery asks if he can spend the night, with Dark agreeing only if he promises to never leave. The two close their eyes but are disturbed, as Montgomery goes into a coughing fit, then explodes into a shower of blood, leaving only a cockroach-like alien who utters, &quot;I&#x27;m outta here&quot;, before crawling out of the window. A blood-covered Dark sits in stunned silence, before screaming out in horror and anguish.

==Cast==
==Reception==
&quot;Nowhere&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 14 reviews, with an average score of .

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;high energy&quot; and stating that &quot;Araki is a marvel at controlling shifting tones, and &quot;Nowhere&quot;, a confident, intricate work, has a great pop art look, yet its emotions are real.&quot; In an article on the upcoming summer films of 1997, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Nowhere&quot; as &quot;California&#x27;s version of &quot;Kids&quot;.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, Jake Hamilton gave the film a negative review, stating, &quot;True, there are some dazzling scenes; a brilliant intercutting sex-scene; death by a Campbell&#x27;s soup tin and a ridiculously absurd finale, but compared to the likes of Richard Linklater&#x27;s endearing &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;Nowhere&quot; is completely lost up its own arse.&quot;

Araki himself described the film as &quot;&quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; on acid&quot;. In a retrospective article on the film in &quot;Nylon&quot;, Marie Lodi wrote, &quot;&quot;Nowhere&quot; surreal and hyper-saturated visuals were just as ahead of its time as its themes.&quot;

==Home media==
In the United States, the film was released on VHS. Elsewhere, it was made available on DVD in the United Kingdom, where it was released on a Region 2 DVD. It was later re-released in the United Kingdom in 2013 featuring a commentary track with Gregg Araki, James Duval, Rachel True, and Jordan Ladd.

Strand Releasing announced plans to release a 4K restoration of &quot;Nowhere&quot;, including scenes not shown in the theatrical version for MPAA ratings purposes, in late 2023. On September 16, 2023, the restoration debuted alongside &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; and &quot;Totally F***ed Up&quot;, Araki&#x27;s other films in his &quot;Teen Apocalypse&quot; trilogy, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles. On September 24, 2024, The Criterion Collection released this restored version of the film as part of its &quot;Gregg Araki&#x27;s Teen Apocalypse Trilogy&quot; set.

<doc id="1223389" wikidata="Q1424103" url="?curid=1223389" title="Rock on Honorable Ones!!">
<text>Rock On Honorable Ones!! is the second studio album by American rock band Bowling for Soup. The title is a reference to the slogan of S.H. Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where Bowling for Soup hails from. Based on the practice of Permian High School in Odessa, Texas (subject of &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;), which is nicknamed &quot;MOJO&quot;, Rider High adopted the slogan &quot;ROHO&quot; in the 1960s. Rider&#x27;s sports teams are called the &quot;Raiders&quot;, and Rider students are informed that &quot;ROHO&quot; stands for &quot;Ride on Honorable Ones&quot;. This is the only Bowling for Soup album to include a horn section.

==Production and recording==
In the summer of 1996, the band announced in a newsletter that they were &quot;busy recording tracks for their third CD and were shooting for a spring &#x27;97 release&quot;. They recorded 24 songs and were in the process of selecting 15 or 16 of the best tunes to put on the new album.

In the next newsletter, they decided to abandon all 24 songs and redo all the songs in a Denton, Texas studio in May. They decided to do this because &quot;we are releasing this CD ourselves, so we wanted to release the burden of having to do all of the production ourselves. Also, we wanted to bring in some fresh ears for the production process. So hopefully we should have a full independent release completed by the end of this summer!&quot;

In a third newsletter from the band, they announced that the new album will be called &quot;Rock On Honorable Ones&quot;. &quot;As a lot of you may already know, BFS is all about &quot;rocking&quot;, and 3/4ths of us went to S.H. Rider High (ROHO), thus, the album is appropriately named. The new CD has 14 new rock songs and, lo and behold, 5 of the songs feature the bestest 4-piece horn section on the planet.&quot;

The band signed to FFROE Records and recorded at Reeltime Audio, headed by Jeff Roe which was based in Denton, Texas. The band would promote the album by playing months of shows while still in the recording process and upon its release a 4 week west coast tour in spring.

By August 1998, &quot;Scope&quot; and &quot;2113&quot; were receiving local air play from the college and some commercial markets and the band announced they were currently in process of recording the EP &quot;Tell Me When to Whoa&quot;.

==Track listing==
===Video for &quot;Cody&quot;===
The song &quot;Cody&quot; has a video, in which the band plays the song, sharing the life with a man, while some live scenes appear.

The video features Lance Morrill, who was seldom seen when he was a part of the band. Jaret Reddick had long hair when the video was filmed, and this is also reflected in the cover of the album.

<text>Isabel, Duchess of Braganza (&quot;née&quot; Isabel Inês de Castro Curvello de Herédia; born 22 November 1966) is a Portuguese noblewoman and wife of Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, the current pretender to the defunct Portuguese throne.

Born into the family of an old Portuguese nobility, Isabel worked as an assets manager prior to her marriage. Since marrying Duarte Pio, Isabel has left the professional world, devoted her attention to her family, and become patron to several Portuguese charities and non-profit foundations. She and her husband have had three children together, thus securing the continuation of the House of Braganza.

== Family ==
Isabel Inês de Castro Curvello de Herédia was born on 22 November 1966, in Lisbon, to Dom Jorge de Herédia (b. 1934), an architect, and his wife, Dona Raquel Leonor Pinheiro de Castro Curvello (b. 1935).

She is a descendant in the male lineage of Francisco Correia de Herédia, 1st Viscount of Ribeira Brava (a &quot;Vitalício&quot; title, meaning Life peerage) and his wife Dona Joana Gil de Borja de Macedo e Meneses (1851-1925). Although Francisco was a member of the Portuguese nobility, he was a famed republican, who was involved in the failed republican uprising of 28 January 1908.

Isabel de Herédia is the first cousin of Manuel Caldeira Cabral, former Portuguese Minister of Economy.

== Early life ==
Isabel lived between metropolitan Portugal and Portuguese Angola until 1975, when Angola was granted independence. Her family subsequently moved to São Paulo, Brazil. There, she studied at the Colégio São Luís, a Jesuit-run institution. In 1990, she obtained a degree in business administration from the Fundação Getúlio Vargas and returned to Portugal to a job in BMF — Sociedade de Gestão de Patrimónios, S.A. She specialized as an asset manager.

== Personal life ==
On 13 May 1995 she married Duarte Pio de Bragança, at Jerónimos Monastery. Present at the ceremony were representatives of various European royal and noble houses: Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant, Prince Henri, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria, among others. The principal Portuguese political figures, including the President of the Republic Mário Soares, Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva and President of the Assembly António Barbosa de Melo, were also present.

Following her marriage and the birth of her first child, Afonso, Isabel resigned from her professional life and devoted herself to the management of her family, the family&#x27;s assets and the patronage of various causes.

<text> (English: &quot;My Reflection&quot;) is the second studio album and first Spanish-language album by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was released on September 12, 2000, as a joint effort between RCA Records and BMG U.S. Latin. After the commercial success of her first album, &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; (1999), Aguilera recorded her follow-up project during 2000. It includes five Spanish-language versions of tracks from her previous album, in addition to four original compositions and two cover songs. The tracks were adapted and composed by Rudy Pérez who also produced the album.

In the United States, peaked at number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts where it spent 19 weeks at the top of both charts, becoming one of the longest albums to chart at number one. The album was the best-selling Latin pop album of 2000 and was certified 6× Platinum (Latin field) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It reached number two in Argentina and Uruguay, as well as number five in Mexico, and has sold 2.2 million copies worldwide.

Upon its release, received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who noted musical similarities to her debut. Despite this, the album achieved success, with Aguilera receiving the Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album and two &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tú)&quot;, &quot;Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti&quot; and &quot;Falsas Esperanzas&quot;. To promote the album, Aguilera extended her tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, into 2001 for eight more dates and performed at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.

== Background and composition ==

According to her manager Steve Kurtz, Aguilera expressed interest in recording a Spanish-language album before she recorded her first album &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;. At the time, Aguilera was simultaneously touring to promote her album and recording a Christmas album &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot;, released later in 2000. &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; was intended to be titled &quot;Latin Lover Girl&quot;; the title&#x27;s origin came from the Spanish version of the song &quot;Reflection&quot;, which Aguilera recorded for the soundtrack to &quot;Mulan&quot;.

In 1999, she began recording in Miami with Cuban-American producer Rudy Pérez. He co-wrote the songs &quot;Si No Te Hubiera Conocido&quot;, &quot;Cuando No es Contigo&quot;, and &quot;El Beso Del Final&quot;. He also composed the Spanish versions of &quot;Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)&quot; (&quot;Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tú)&quot;), &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; (&quot;Genio Atrapado&quot;), &quot;I Turn to You&quot; (&quot;Por Siempre Tú&quot;), &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; (&quot;Una Mujer&quot;), and &quot;Reflection&quot; (&quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;). Aguilera covers Perez&#x27;s song &quot;Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti&quot;, which was originally performed by Puerto Rican singer Lourdes Robles on her album &quot;Definitivamente&quot; (1991). Pérez stated that Aguilera did not know any Spanish while recording; he remedied the problem by phonetically writing out lyrics and included a system that allowed Aguilera to pronounce the &quot;r&#x27;s&quot; in the songs. &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; features a cover of César Portillo de la Luz&#x27;s bolero &quot;Contigo En La Distancia&quot;. Additionally, Aguilera made a duet with Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi on the ballad &quot;Si No Te Hubiera Conocido&quot;. Aguilera wanted Fonsi to perform a duet with her because she felt that she could relate to him as they &quot;grew up listening to the same things&quot;. &quot;Cuando No es Contigo&quot; is an uptempo salsa song which was arranged by Sergio George. &quot;Falsas Esperanzas&quot; is another uptempo song in the album which features Cuban musician Paquito Hechevarria performing the piano.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; received an average score of 56, based on seven reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as a mirror image of her debut album &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;. He felt that it was a &quot;little too familiar&quot; although he praised recordings as &quot;well-produced&quot;; however, he concluded that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t add anything new to her music, since it&#x27;s just the old music in new clothing.&quot; An editor for &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that Aguilera has yielded a mostly mainstream pop album with Latin inflections. Eliseo Cardona of CDNow gave the album a mixed review. While he enjoyed Aguilera&#x27;s vocal performance, which he described as &quot; precisely, gracefully, forcefully &quot;, he criticized the literal Spanish translation of the lyrics from English, which he said made a &quot;good laugh and a better yawn&quot;. He commended &quot;Cuando No es Contigo&quot; as making Aguilera a &quot;credible, expressive salsera&quot; and her cover of &quot;Contigo en la Distancia&quot; as the album&#x27;s finest moment.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, who gave the album a C rating, wrote the review in a parody memo from Aguilera&#x27;s point of view. He mocked at Aguilera&#x27;s attempt at making a Spanish-language album simply because of her Ecuadorian heritage, criticized her &quot;unnecessary&quot; high note&quot;, ballads that &quot;old Latin ladies&#x27;ll like&quot;, and the photos used in the album&#x27;s booklet. Mike Magnuson of HOB.com wrote a critical review of the album admonishing the photos in the record for attempting to make Aguilera look Latino which he insisted was a bad influence for the younger audience. Though he mentions that &quot;you can count on her agreeable voice&quot; and lauded the use of Latin percussion and horns, he asserted that the record was &quot;purely a marketing scam gone too far.&quot; Parry Gettelman from &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; stated that &quot;Mi Reflejo lacks emotional depth, and her decision to record in Spanish seems more a bid to conquer new chart territory than anything else&quot;.

Sonicnet called its production &quot;superslick&quot; and compared Aguilera&#x27;s vocals to that of Mariah Carey, completing that the album &quot;almost guarantees that the diminutive diva will expand her colonial powers south of the border. In other words, she&#x27;s planning to do a reverse Ricky Martin on us&quot;. Ernesto Lechner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rated the album two out of four stars comparing her vocals in her debut album and in &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;, describing her performance in the latter as &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He complained about Aguilera&#x27;s cover of &quot;Contigo en la Distancia&quot; which he described as a &quot;bloated confection&quot;. Kurt B. Reighley from Wall of Sound wrote that the album is &quot;an impressive addition to young Christina&#x27;s limited canon&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Promotion==
To promote &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot;, Aguilera extended her tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, into 2001 for eight more dates, visiting Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Panama and Japan.

The song reached number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs and number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Pop Songs charts. It also peaked at number eight in Spain. The second single, &quot;Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti&quot; was released in December 2000. The song reached number eight on the Hot Latin Songs and number five on Latin Pop Songs charts.

==Legacy and achievements==
In September 2018, &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; was ranked number ten on the &quot;Billboards Top 20 Latin Albums of All Time, and in 2020 the same media brand included it on its list of the longest-leading albums of all time on the Top Latin Albums chart (at number twelve). The album spent 19 weeks at number one on &quot;Billboards Top Latin Albums ranking at number 13 with the most weeks at number one. &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; was best fifth best-selling Latin album of 2000 and became the second best-selling Latin album of the year later after &quot;Paulina&quot; by Paulina Rubio. The album was also the best-selling Latin pop album of 2000.

In a 2020 statement for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Aguilera noted that she &quot;was excited to bring a new life to [the] songs and reinvent [them]&quot;. She added that she &quot;was allowed to create and express new ad libs and vocal runs that [she] wasn&#x27;t given the freedom to do on her original record&quot;. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writer Muri Assuncão noted that after the release of the album, Aguilera went on to use &quot;her Latin charm and sultry persona — not to mention her jaw-dropping four-octave vocal range — to become one of pop music&#x27;s most beloved icons&quot;. In the 2021 article for &quot;POPline&quot;, it was noted that &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; introduced Aguilera to the general public as a &quot;fearless&quot; and &quot;versatile&quot; artist, and also &quot;played a pivotal role in the expansion of Spanish-language music within today&#x27;s American pop scene.&quot;

==Commercial performance==

&quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; debuted at number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling nearly 43,000 copies in its first week.

<text>Baby Cow Productions Limited is a British comedy television production company based in London and Manchester, founded by Steve Coogan and Henry Normal. Since its establishment it has diversified into radio, animation and film. According to their website, Baby Cow &quot;produces bold, high-quality scripted entertainment across all genres for television, film and radio.&quot; The company&#x27;s name is a reference to Coogan&#x27;s early characters Paul and Pauline Calf.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1999 by Steve Coogan and Henry Normal, with Coogan assuming the role of Creative Director and Normal assuming the role of CEO.

In 2008, BBC Worldwide bought a 25% stake in the company. The acquisition was made at a time when BBC Worldwide was being criticised for its &quot;out of control&quot; ventures, though Normal told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that BBC Worldwide had not made the highest bid.

In April 2016, Normal stood down as CEO and left the full time position. He remained a consultant of the company for the following year and supported the company while they looked to replace him. Coogan then assumed a broader role as part of his transition.

Upon his departure, Normal commented that “After sixteen and a half years I&#x27;ve decided to take a long overdue break from TV and film production to pursue creative endeavours in other fields. I&#x27;m very proud to have been part of a company that has nurtured young talent, sought out originality and produced quality award-winning shows year after year. Steve has such a great team around him and with further support from BBC Worldwide, I know Baby Cow will achieve even greater success in the years to come.” Coogan then went on to add that “Henry has devoted himself brilliantly to the company over the years and deserves to pursue more personal projects. I salute him. He leaves behind a passionate team with great taste and the company he co-founded is in a strong place to grow.&quot;

Normal was eventually replaced with Christine Langan, who was the CEO until November 2020. She left her role as head of BBC Films for the job. BBC Worldwide then increased their stake in the company to 73% after Normal&#x27;s departure. Langan has taken an executive producer role on every Baby Cow productions since she took the job including &quot;Camping&quot;, &quot;The Killing Machine&quot;, &quot;This Time with Alan Partridge&quot; and a new show entitled &quot;The Witchfinder&quot;, starring Tim Key and Daisy May Cooper, which premiered in the spring of 2022.

<doc id="1223414" wikidata="Q275669" url="?curid=1223414" title="Cook Islands national football team">
<text>The Cook Islands men&#x27;s national football team is the men&#x27;s football team that represents the Cook Islands in international competition since 1971. It is governed by the Cook Islands Football Association which is part of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) and FIFA.

The nation has participated in seven FIFA World Cup qualification attempts since their first attempt back in 1998. They have qualified for the OFC Nations Cup twice in 1998 and 2000 OFC Nations Cup with both appearances seeing no wins from their four games that they have played.

==History==
===Beginnings (1971–1995)===
Despite being absent from the first three editions of the South Pacific Games, the geographical proximity of the Cook Islands with French Polynesia, host of the 1971 South Pacific Games, allowed the Cookian team to take part in the tournament. In the first round they were defeated 16–1 by Papua New Guinea and 30–0 by Tahiti, while in the match for fifth place, they fell to Fiji 15–1.

They next played a match in 1995 when proximity allowed them to participate again in the 1995 South Pacific Games. During the tournament they earned their first win, a 2–1 win over Wallis and Futuna, but lost their other four clashes resoundingly.

===The two OFC Nations Cup (1996–2001)===
The Cook Islands qualified for their first OFC Nations Cup after finishing second in the 1998 Polynesia Cup, which they hosted. They faced Australia and Fiji in Group B, in what proved to be a tough draw. Australia crushed the Cook Islands 16–0 in their first match, scoring eight goals either side of the interval. In their next match against Fiji, however, the Cook Islands acquitted themselves much better, losing only 3–0, but with two defeats from two matches they failed to make the semi-finals.

In finishing 2nd at the 2000 Polynesia Cup, the Cook Islands also qualified for the OFC Nations Cup. They were drawn in Group A along with the Solomon Islands, and again, Australia. After their heavy defeat at the hands of Australia in the previous tournament, the Cook Islands hoped to avoid a repeat performance. However, they were powerless to prevent their opponents from running rampant, this time to the tune of 17–0. The Solomon Islands were up next, and in this game the Cook Islands had the consolation of scoring their first goal at the OFC Nations Cup – the only bright spot in an otherwise bleak 5–1 defeat. After two defeats, then, the Cooks Islands again went out at the group stage.

===Decline (2002–present)===
They next entered qualification for the 2004 tournament however they lost all four matches and failed to progress.

They returned to the South Pacific Games for the 2007 competition where they could only beat Tuvalu 4–1. Four years later, at Nouméa 2011, they defeated Kiribati 3–0, but lost their other three meetings; while in 2012 OFC Nations Cup qualification they drew with American Samoa and fell to Samoa and Tonga.

In the 2016 OFC Nations Cup qualifiers, they beat Tonga 3–1 and Samoa 1–0, but fell in the last game against American Samoa 2-0, which relegated the Cook Islands to third place, surpassed on goal difference by both Samoas.

In March 2022, the Cook Islands played their first match in seven years when they lost 2–0 to the Solomon Islands in qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, they had to withdraw from their remaining matches due to a COVID-19 outbreak.

On 28 August 2023, Cook Islands resumed their international matches playing against Tahiti but suffered a 9–1 heavy defeat to Tahiti at the Stade Pater Te Hono Nui in Pirae.

<text>Don Hopkins is an artist and programmer specializing in human computer interaction and computer graphics. He is an alumnus of the University of Maryland and a former member of the University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab.

He inspired Richard Stallman, who described him as a &quot;very imaginative fellow&quot;, to use the term copyleft. He coined Deep Crack as the name of the EFF DES cracker. He ported the &quot;SimCity&quot; computer game to several versions of Unix and developed a multi player version of &quot;SimCity&quot; for X11, did much of the core programming of &quot;The Sims&quot;, and developed robot control and personality simulation software for Will Wright&#x27;s Stupid Fun Club.

He developed and refined pie menus for many platforms and applications including window managers, Emacs, &quot;SimCity&quot; and &quot;The Sims&quot;, and published a frequently cited paper about pie menus at CHI&#x27;88 with John Raymond Callahan, Ben Shneiderman and Mark Weiser. He has published many free software and open source implementations of pie menus for X10, X11, NeWS, Tcl/tk, ScriptX, ActiveX, JavaScript, OpenLaszlo, Python and OLPC, and also proprietary implementations for &quot;The Sims&quot; and the Palm Pilot.

Hopkins also wrote demonstrations and programming examples of the ScriptX multimedia scripting language created by the Apple/IBM research spinoff Kaleida Labs, developed various OpenLaszlo applications and components, and is a hacker artist known for his artistic cellular automata. He is also known for having written a chapter &quot;The X-Windows Disaster&quot; on X Window System in the book The UNIX-HATERS Handbook.

==Micropolis==
Hopkins, supported by John Gilmore, adapted &quot;SimCity&quot; for the OLPC XO-1 laptop. The current version includes pie menus and is explained in depth in a video released by Hopkins.

Since its primary objective is education, the OLPC project is looking not just for games, but for tools that enable kids to program their own games. Hopkins programmed Micropolis to make it easy to extend in many interesting ways. He added functionality to let kids create new disasters and agents (like the monster, tornado, helicopter and train), and program them like in many of the other games on the XO. The goals of deeply integrating &quot;SimCity&quot; with OLPC&#x27;s Sugar user interface are to focus on education and accessibility for younger kids, as well as motivating and enabling older kids to learn programming.

==&quot;The Sims&quot;==

&quot;The Sims&quot; is a simulation video game developed by Electronic Arts. The games are known for their very loose guidelines and no specific user goals. They allow the users to simply exist in the virtual world they create. Don Hopkins became involved in &quot;The Sims&quot; after he worked at Sun Microsystems. &quot;The Sims&quot; were a theme in his work since then and he has contributed to much of the design and conceptual development of the game. He was hired to port &quot;The Sims&quot; to Unix. He implemented the usage of pie menus to the game so that users could efficiently carry out actions in the game world.

<text>The zone ( &quot;zōnē&quot;, from ζώννυμι &quot;zōnnȳmi&quot;, &quot;I gird&quot;) is a form of girdle or belt common in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean. In ancient Greece, the zone was traditionally worn by women.

== In ancient Greece ==

=== Cultural significance ===
For ancient Greek women, the zone is used as a sign of their sexual maturity, since pre-pubescent girls do not wear them. However, younger girls do wear zones, but an unbelted version of it. Adult women who are unmarried wear a belted version of the zone which signifies their virginity. The process of the bride tying the belt&#x27;s knot prior to the wedding is symbolic of her readiness for marriage. The belt is meant to be removed by their husband on their wedding night. A married woman still uses a zone, and also a belted version, though it looks different from the one used by an unmarried woman. The belts are only removed during their pregnancy and childbirth.

At the same time, female foreigners (also known as barbarians in ancient Greece) do not wear belts. The male foreigners, however, do, and this signifies their lack of manliness.

=== In literature ===
The zone has featured in Greek literature depicting female mythological figures. It is often used to symbolize female sexuality, such as when Hera seduced her husband, Zeus, while wearing her zone in the Iliad or Pandora, as she was created by Athena in Theogony, appeared with her zone and &quot;silvery raiment&quot;. The zone is also used as a way to maintain female agency, where the zone is used by Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Suppliant Maidens&quot; as a way to commit suicide when the alternative is to enter unwanted matrimony.

== In Christianity ==
In modern Greek and Church Slavonic the zone or (Пояс, &quot;poyas&quot; - &quot;belt&quot;) is a liturgical belt worn as a vestment by priests and bishops of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches. It is made of brocade with an embroidered or appliquéd cross in the center, with long ribbons at the ends for tying around the waist. It is worn over the sticharion and the epitrachelion and keeps them in place as the priest performs the Divine Liturgy. In this regard it is similar to the cincture of the Roman Catholic Church.

The zone is not worn for services when the priest is not fully vested, &quot;e.g.&quot; vespers or matins.

The zone worn by priests of the Old Believers of the Russian Tradition, have a unique design, with four pendant strips, two on each hip. This was the result of legislation passed under Empress Catherine the Great, mandating that the vestments of Old Believer clergy be sufficiently different from those of clergy belonging to the State Church, in order to avoid confusion.

<doc id="1223432" wikidata="Q7717606" url="?curid=1223432" title="The Eastern States Exposition">
<text>The Big E, formally known as The Eastern States Exposition, is an annual fair in West Springfield, Massachusetts, which opens on the second Friday after Labor Day and runs for seventeen days.

It is billed as &quot;New England&#x27;s Great State Fair,&quot; the largest agricultural event on the eastern seaboard and the fifth-largest fair in the nation. The Big E is inclusive of all six New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

==History==

The first Eastern States Exposition occurred in October 1916 in West Springfield, Massachusetts, and was called the Eastern States Agricultural and Industrial Exposition. All six New England states, plus Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, participated. Joshua L. Brooks conceived it to help promote agriculture and educate young people with the skills and knowledge needed in agricultural vocations. The Exposition featured displays of innovations in the industry and held contests designed to encourage farmers to better themselves through competition.

The Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America partnered with the Exposition to organize youth competitions, in which prizes were awarded for best produce, jams, breads, raised hens, planting techniques, and other categories. The youth component drew competitors from all ten participating states and was deemed &quot;a triumph in a new type of education.&quot; An eight-day camp program was established at Springfield&#x27;s Camp Vail for all youths who placed first or second in judged competitions.

The ten-state format continued into the 1920s, with the month of the Exposition moving to September. According to officials, the &quot;Eastern States movement&quot; aimed to make the ten states &quot;more nearly self-supporting food-wise and possess a large, prosperous and contented farming population.&quot; Emphasis on the development of young farmers continued with the establishment of &quot;Baby Beef Clubs&quot; in 1920 to help youths buy, raise, exhibit, and sell livestock at the event.

The exposition grew beyond agriculture and industry within its first few years. In 1923, the Massachusetts Department of Health built a model schoolhouse on the fairgrounds, offering free medical and dental examinations. The rise of the eugenics movement in the 1920s led to the inclusion of &quot;Fitter Family&quot; contests, in which prizes were awarded to individuals and families based on appearance and ethnic background. Exhibits on Native American culture were added, including a tipi exhibit hosted by Reginald and Gladys Laubin in 1926. Entertainment elements were added by the 1930s, including demonstrations of &quot;automobile polo&quot; (featuring acrobats playing polo while driving Ford cars) and competitive performances by high school bands.

By 1940, the exposition had focused more on the six New England states. At that year&#x27;s horse show in West Springfield, competitors from Delaware, New Jersey, and New York were placed in the open classes instead of the New England division.

In 1966, for its fiftieth anniversary, the fair began marketing itself as &quot;The Big E.&quot; The &quot;E&quot; stands for what organizers said was an emphasis on &quot;entertainment, education and excitement.&quot;

Since the first fair, only World War I and World War II, during which the military requisitioned the grounds as storage depots, and the COVID-19 pandemic have interrupted the annual tradition.
==Attractions==
===Avenue of States===

The &quot;Avenue of States&quot; contains life-size replicas of the six original New England statehouses, as well as the New England Grange House. In actuality, the state houses are not replicas but rather modeled after original state houses in most instances. The buildings for New Hampshire and Vermont bear no resemblance to their original state houses. 

These buildings feature exhibits and vendors that exemplify the heritage, food, and traditions of each state as a way of promoting tourism. For example, the Maine House offers lobster, blueberry, and baked potatoes, while the Vermont House has Ben and Jerry&#x27;s ice cream, maple syrup, and Cabot cheese. Vendors also sell locally-made products and handicrafts. The Maine baked potatoes have become an icon, with buyers regularly joining long lines during the fair&#x27;s busier periods. The Connecticut building supplies Timex watches as well as Lego, which has its US headquarters in that state. The Rhode Island building features Del&#x27;s Lemonade and Blount Seafood Clamcakes and Chowder, as well as books from Rhode Island author C. M. Eddy, Jr., who has links back to H. P. Lovecraft and Houdini in Rhode Island.

Much like national embassies, the statehouses and the land on which they sit are owned by the respective jurisdiction. Through an arrangement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they are administered by representatives from each state&#x27;s police force during the fair. Due to this distinction, tickets for each of the six lotteries can be purchased among the houses.

===Livestock and animals===

The Big E remains true to its agricultural roots today, with more than 7,100 4-H and FFA participants, and 1,100 open-show exhibitors, as well as educational displays and attractions.

In keeping with the fair&#x27;s agricultural roots, there are many livestock displays at The Big E. The Big E Coliseum features daily horse shows, while the Mallary Complex houses livestock and other farm animals, including goats, chickens, pigs, and sheep.

Other animals, such as those found at petting zoos or in the Big E Circus Spectacular, are also featured at The Big E. There are also many 4-H youth livestock shows and a sale of the 4-H steers.

===Food===
Many foods representing New England cuisine can be found at The Big E, along with traditional fair foods like fried dough, corn dogs, and lemonade. Aside from the state houses, food sellers can be found throughout the main vendor areas and around the perimeter of the fairgrounds.

Since 2000, The Big E has endeavored to introduce its own signature foods. This began in 2002 when The Big E introduced Big E Cream Puffs, which it intended to be the signature dessert of the Fair. The Big E features the cream puffs in some of its advertising; in addition, the cream puffs have been featured on local and national TV shows, including &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot;. This was followed by the introduction in 2004 of &quot;The Big (Chocolate) Eclairs&quot; and, in 2006, of Big E Chocolate Chip Cookies, made with Ghirardelli chocolate. In 2009, they introduced the &quot;Craz-E Burger,&quot; which is a bacon cheeseburger on a glazed donut rather than a bun.

===Vendors===
Small shops are a primary attraction of the Big E. Vendors can be found across most of the fairgrounds, selling items ranging from state-specific s and regional memorabilia to household goods, clothing, and accessories. Many vendors set up shops selling the same goods in multiple areas of the fair in order to attract as many customers as possible.

The Better Living Center is the largest vendor area, featuring household wares, home improvement services, cookware, and health supplements. The International Building is home to vendors selling items from other cultures, in particular those with a common connection with many New Englanders, in particular Irish and Italian imported goods.

===Concerts===
The Xfinity Arena provides an open-air performing area with seating for over 6,000 people. Each weekend, big-name bands and musicians come to perform on this stage. There are ticketed shows (admission to the fair is included with the purchase of a concert ticket as long as it is purchased before the date of the show) as well as a number of free shows that are seated on a &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; basis.

The Court of Honor Stage, located right in the heart of the fairgrounds, also offers free concerts.

===Other attractions===
* Storrowton Village, where fairgoers can experience New England life from the 19th century.
* The Midway, home to carnival rides and games, is operated by North American Midway Entertainment. The Giant Slide is 46 feet high and 135 feet long. It was originally erected near Gate 5 in 1969 but moved to its current spot behind the Better Living Center in 1983.
* A daily Mardi Gras-style parade
* The Eastern States Coliseum, more colloquially known as the &quot;Big E Coliseum,&quot; is an arena on the grounds where numerous equestrian contests and other special events are held. The building was formerly a professional ice hockey venue.
* Animatronic shows, namely &quot;Melody Farm Follies&quot; in the &quot;Farm-A-Rama&quot; section and in 2015 and 2016, the &quot;Billy Bob&#x27;s Bear-A-Dise&quot; traveling Rock-afire Explosion show.

==Other uses==
The fairgrounds are used for other events throughout the year, including

* Amherst Railway Society Railroad Hobby Show
* Equine Affaire
* Northeastern Poultry Congress
* Society of Manufacturing Engineers EASTEC exposition
* Springfield RV Camping &amp; Outdoor Show
* Springfield Sportsmen&#x27;s Show
* Wedding &amp; Bridal Expo

In January 2013, the Exposition joined with Hard Rock International in a proposal to build a casino and hotel on 40 acres of the fairground in a bid for the single casino license available in Western Massachusetts. In a town referendum on September 10, the voters of West Springfield voted the project down.

It is also the film debut of Lena Olin.

==Releases==
The film was conceived and produced as a four-part mini-series on Swedish television with a running time of 177 minutes. The episodes were entitled:
# Uppbrottet (The Separation)
# Gränsen (The Border)
# Skymningslandet (The Twilight Land)

The film was later screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival held in May, but was not entered into the main competition. The television version aired in Sweden over four weeks in April and May of that year, and was released on-demand by in 2022.

==Plot==
Dr. Jenny Isaksson (Liv Ullmann) is a psychiatrist who has taken a temporary job as the medical supervisor at a mental hospital while her husband is in America and their daughter Anna is away at camp. As she and her family are in the process of selling their home, she temporarily moves in with her grandparents (Gunnar Björnstrand, Aino Taube), who cared for her after her parents died when she was a child. The experience of moving back into her old bedroom proves disturbing for her and conjures up feelings of anxiety, resulting in her first beginning to have dreams and then waking visions of a one-eyed old woman. Jenny&#x27;s personal problems are compounded by Mari, a particularly disturbed patient at the mental hospital, who is prone to fits of violence and who tells Jenny that she is incapable of treating her because she cannot experience love.

At a party hosted by the ex-wife of one of her colleagues at the mental hospital, Jenny meets the divorced Tomas (Erland Josephson), a medical doctor. After he flirts with her, she agrees to go home with him, where she rejects the idea of having sex with him before he brings it up. Nonplussed, Tomas calls her a taxi and they agree to meet again sometime in the future for a potential sexual encounter.

Going to her old home one day, Jenny discovers Mari, who has escaped from the mental institution; with her are two men who explain that Mari requested they take her to Jenny, whose address they found in the phone book. When Jenny attempts to call the police, the men attack her and attempt to rape her, but quickly stop when they have difficulty penetrating her. That night, Jenny accompanies Tomas to a concert and then returns home with him, telling him she wants a non-sexual encounter with him in which they will sleep in bed together without touching. In the middle of the night, Jenny tells him what happened and admits that she is so desperate to experience physical pleasure that she wanted the rapist to have sex with her, but that she could not become physically aroused. When Tomas attempts to comfort her, she suffers a breakdown and asks to be sent home in a cab, assuring him they&#x27;ll see one another soon.

Jenny sleeps at her grandparents&#x27; for several days, missing work. When they leave town for the weekend she initially calls Tomas to go to the movies, but instead hangs up on him, records a suicide note on a tape recorder in which she tells her husband that she has never experienced emotional or physical pleasure, and then takes fifty Nembutols.

In a dream, she apologizes to herself for her suicide attempt, speaks to her grandmother, and tells herself that she fears old people like her grandparents. She encounters an imagined Tomas, who warns her not to open the door to her deep and forgotten memories, but she opens anyway. She sees the old woman, who caresses and comforts her. Jenny wakes up in the hospital. Tomas is there. He went to find her after she hung up on him and didn’t answer when he tried calling back.

They talk, and Tomas tries to comfort her by telling her about his strict upbringing, not being allowed to burp or fart at dinner. In a second dream, she ineptly tries to deal with a crowded room of patients. Her grandfather tells her that he’s afraid of dying, and Anna sees her and runs away.

When she wakes, her husband is there, but he tells her that he has to return to America. She tells him to tell her grandmother the truth about what happened and that she will talk to Anna.

In the next dream, she tries to find her parents, whom she last saw at their funeral when she was nine. She is distressed by guilt and shame. When she finds them they first leave her, but when they return to comfort her, she pushes them away.

Jenny wakes up and tells Tomas about her childhood. They share deep secrets. Tomas says that he was never divorced, instead he had lost a friend, a man he lived with for five years. The conversation deteriorates and Jenny becomes hysterical. In a last dream, she attends her funeral, awaking during the cremation.

A nurse tells Jenny that Anna wants to meet her. She tries to tell Anna what she did and why, but it doesn’t go well. Anna tells Jenny that she knew that she never liked her, and she leaves. Tomas then tells her that he’s going to Jamaica for an amoral vacation and may not return.

Jenny returns to her grandmother who believes that Jenny has only been fatigued. She is distressed by her husband’s impending death. Jenny offers her some comfort and then calls the mental hospital to tell them that she’ll be in to work in the morning.

Aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 76% approval of &quot;Face to Face&quot; based on 17 reviews. Vincent Canby was highly favorable and wrote, &quot;Mr. Bergman is more mysterious, more haunting, more contradictory than ever, though the style of the film has never been more precise, clear, levelheaded.&quot; Roger Ebert, while calling it &quot;confused and sometimes overwrought&quot;, awarded it three out of four stars and lauded Ullmann&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of the greatest performances in an Ingmar Bergman film&quot; up to that point.

<text>The endocrine system is a network of glands and organs located throughout the body. It is similar to the nervous system in that it plays a vital role in controlling and regulating many of the body&#x27;s functions. Endocrine glands are ductless glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, hormones, directly into the blood. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testicles, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary glands are neuroendocrine organs.

==Pituitary gland==

The pituitary gland hangs from the base of the brain by the pituitary stalk, and is enclosed by bone. It consists of a hormone-producing glandular portion of the anterior pituitary and a neural portion of the posterior pituitary, which is an extension of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus regulates the hormonal output of the anterior pituitary and creates two hormones that it exports to the posterior pituitary for storage and later release.

Four of the six anterior pituitary hormones are tropic hormones that regulate the function of other endocrine organs. Most anterior pituitary hormones exhibit a diurnal rhythm of release, which is subject to modification by stimuli influencing the hypothalamus.

Somatotropic hormone or growth hormone (GH) is an anabolic hormone that stimulates the growth of all body tissues especially skeletal muscle and bone. It may act directly, or indirectly via insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). GH mobilizes fats, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits glucose uptake and metabolism. Secretion is regulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH), or somatostatin. Hypersecretion causes gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults; hyposecretion in children causes pituitary dwarfism.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone promotes normal development and activity of the thyroid gland. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulates its release; negative feedback of thyroid hormone inhibits it.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulates the adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids. Adrenocorticotropic hormone release is triggered by corticotropin-releasing hormone and inhibited by rising glucocorticoid levels.

The gonadotropins—follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone regulate the functions of the gonads in both sexes. Follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sex cell production; luteinizing hormone stimulates gonadal hormone production. Gonadotropin levels rise in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Negative feedback of gonadal hormones inhibits gonadotropin release.

Prolactin promotes milk production in human females. Its secretion is prompted by prolactin-releasing hormone and inhibited by prolactin-inhibiting hormone.

The intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland secretes only one enzyme that is melanocyte stimulating hormone. It is linked with the formation of the black pigment in our skin called melanin.

The neurohypophysis stores and releases two hypothalamic hormones:
* Oxytocin stimulates powerful uterine contractions, which trigger labour and delivery of an infant, and milk ejection in nursing women. Its release is mediated reflexively by the hypothalamus and represents a positive feedback mechanism.
* Antidiuretic hormone stimulates the kidney tubules to reabsorb and conserve water, resulting in small volumes of highly concentrated urine and decreased plasma osmolality. Antidiuretic hormone is released in response to high solute concentrations in the blood and inhibited by low solute concentrations in the blood. Hyposecretion results in diabetes insipidus.

== Thyroid gland ==

The thyroid gland is located in the front of the neck, in front of the thyroid cartilage, and is shaped like a butterfly, with two wings connected by a central . Thyroid tissue consists of follicles with a stored protein called colloid, containing thyroglobulin, a precursor to other thyroid hormones, which are manufactured within the colloid.

The thyroid hormones increase the rate of cellular metabolism, and include thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Secretion is stimulated by the thyroid-stimulating hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary. When thyroid levels are high, there is negative feedback that decreases the amount of Thyroid-stimulating hormone secreted. Most T4 is converted to T3 (a more active form) in the target tissues.

Calcitonin, produced by the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland in response to rising blood calcium levels, depresses blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone matrix resorption and enhancing calcium deposit in bones.
Excessive secretion cause hyperthyroidism and deficiency cause hypothyroidism.

== Parathyroid glands ==

The parathyroid glands, of which there are 4–6, are found on the back of the thyroid glands, and secrete parathyroid hormone, This causes an increase in blood calcium levels by targeting bone, the intestine, and the kidneys. The parathyroid hormone is the antagonist of calcitonin. Parathyroid hormone release is triggered by falling blood calcium levels and is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels.

== Adrenal glands ==

The adrenal glands are located above the kidneys in humans and
in front of the kidneys in other animals. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone cortisol and Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA). Adrenaline increases blood pressure, heart rate, and metabolism in reaction to stress, the aldosterone controls the body&#x27;s salt and water balance, the cortisol plays a role in stress response and the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA) produces aids in production of body odor and growth of body hair during puberty.

== Pancreas ==

The pancreas, located in the abdomen, below and behind the stomach, is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland. The alpha and beta cells are the endocrine cells in the pancreatic islets that release insulin and glucagon and smaller amounts of other hormones into the blood. Insulin and glucagon influence blood sugar levels. Glucagon is released when the blood glucose level is low and stimulates the liver to release glucose into the blood. Insulin increases the rate of glucose uptake and metabolism by most body cells.

Somatostatin is released by delta cells and acts as an inhibitor of GH, insulin, and glucagon.

== Gonads ==

The ovaries of the female, located in the pelvic cavity, release two main hormones. Secretion of estrogens by the ovarian follicles begins at puberty under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone. Estrogens stimulate the maturation of the female reproductive system and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Progesterone is released in response to high blood levels of luteinizing hormone. It works with estrogens in establishing the menstrual cycle.

The testes of the male begin to produce testosterone at puberty in response to luteinizing hormone. Testosterone promotes maturation of the male reproductive organs, development of secondary sex characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.

== Pineal gland ==

The pineal gland is located in the diencephalon of the brain. It primarily releases melatonin, which influences daily rhythms and may have an antigonadotropic effect in humans. It may also influence the melanotropes and melanocytes located in the skin.

== Other hormone-producing structures ==
Many body organs not normally considered endocrine organs contain isolated cell clusters that secrete hormones. Examples include the heart (atrial natriuretic peptide); gastrointestinal tract organs (gastrin, secretin, and others); the placenta (hormones of pregnancy—estrogen, progesterone, and others); the kidneys (erythropoietin and renin); the thymus; skin (cholecalciferol); and adipose tissue (leptin and resistin).

==Development==
Endocrine glands derive from all three germ layers.

The natural decrease in function of the female&#x27;s ovaries during late middle age results in menopause. The efficiency of all endocrine glands seems to decrease gradually as ageing occurs. This leads to a generalized increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus and a lower metabolic rate.

==Functions==
===Hormones===

Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

The ability of a target cell to respond to a hormone depends on the presence of receptors, within the cell or on its plasma membrane, to which the hormone can bind.

Hormone receptors are dynamic structures. Changes in the number and sensitivity of hormone receptors may occur in response to high or low levels of stimulating hormones.

Blood levels of hormones reflect a balance between secretion and degradation/excretion. The liver and kidneys are the major organs that degrade hormones; breakdown products are excreted in urine and faeces.

Hormone half-life and duration of activity are limited and vary from hormone to hormone.

Interaction of hormones at target cells
&quot;Permissiveness&quot; is the situation in which a hormone cannot exert its full effects without the presence of another hormone.

&quot;Synergism&quot; occurs when two or more hormones produce the same effects in a target cell and their results are amplified.

&quot;Antagonism&quot; occurs when a hormone opposes or reverses the effect of another hormone.

===Control===

The endocrine glands belong to the body&#x27;s control system. The hormones which they produce help to regulate the functions of cells and tissues throughout the body. Endocrine organs are activated to release their hormones by humoral, neural, or hormonal stimuli. Negative feedback is important in regulating hormone levels in the blood.

The nervous system, acting through hypothalamic controls, can in certain cases override or modulate hormonal effects.

==Clinical significance==
===Disease===
Diseases of the endocrine glands are common, including conditions such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, and obesity.

Endocrine disease is characterized by irregulated hormone release (a productive pituitary adenoma), inappropriate response to signalling (hypothyroidism), lack of a gland (diabetes mellitus type 1, diminished erythropoiesis in chronic kidney failure), or structural enlargement in a critical site such as the thyroid (toxic multinodular goitre). Hypofunction of endocrine glands can occur as a result of the loss of reserve, hyposecretion, agenesis, atrophy, or active destruction. Hyperfunction can occur as a result of hypersecretion, loss of suppression, hyperplastic, or neoplastic change, or hyperstimulation.

Endocrinopathies are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. Primary endocrine disease inhibits the action of downstream glands. Secondary endocrine disease is indicative of a problem with the pituitary gland. Tertiary endocrine disease is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamus and its releasing hormones.

As the thyroid, and hormones have been implicated in signaling distant tissues to proliferate, for example, the estrogen receptor has been shown to be involved in certain breast cancers. Endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine signaling have all been implicated in proliferation, one of the required steps of oncogenesis.

Other common diseases that result from endocrine dysfunction include Addison&#x27;s disease, Cushing&#x27;s disease and Grave&#x27;s disease. Cushing&#x27;s disease and Addison&#x27;s disease are pathologies involving the dysfunction of the adrenal gland. Dysfunction in the adrenal gland could be due to primary or secondary factors and can result in hypercortisolism or hypocortisolism. Cushing&#x27;s disease is characterized by the hypersecretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone due to a pituitary adenoma that ultimately causes endogenous hypercortisolism by stimulating the adrenal glands. Some clinical signs of Cushing&#x27;s disease include obesity, moon face, and hirsutism. Addison&#x27;s disease is an endocrine disease that results from hypocortisolism caused by adrenal gland insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is significant because it is correlated with decreased ability to maintain blood pressure and blood sugar, a defect that can prove to be fatal.

Graves&#x27; disease involves the hyperactivity of the thyroid gland which produces the T3 and T4 hormones. Graves&#x27; disease effects range from excess sweating, fatigue, heat intolerance and high blood pressure to swelling of the eyes that causes redness, puffiness and in rare cases reduced or double vision.

Graves&#x27; disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism; hyposecretion causes cretinism in infants and myxoedema in adults.

Hyperparathyroidism results in hypercalcemia and its effects and in extreme bone wasting. Hypoparathyroidism leads to hypocalcemia, evidenced by tetany seizure and respiratory paralysis.
Hyposecretion of insulin results in diabetes mellitus; cardinal signs are polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia.

<text>Siouxland is a vernacular region that encompasses the entire Big Sioux River drainage basin in the U.S. states of South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa. The demonym for a resident of Siouxland is Siouxlander.

A &quot;vernacular region&quot; is a distinctive area where the inhabitants collectively consider themselves interconnected by a shared history, mutual interests, and a common identity. Such regions are &quot;intellectual inventions&quot; and a form of shorthand to identify things, people, and places. Vernacular regions reflect a &quot;sense of place,&quot; but rarely coincide with established jurisdictional borders.

The lower Big Sioux River drainage basin stretches from Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, an area that includes much of northwestern Iowa, the northeast corner of Nebraska, the southeast corner of South Dakota, and the extreme southwest corner of Minnesota.

The term &quot;Siouxland&quot; was coined by author Frederick Manfred in 1946. Manfred was born in Doon, Iowa, a small town in Lyon County.

==Origin==
Frederick Manfred, who grew up in this region, set his novels in Minnesota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska, but these names alone did not meet his needs. Manfred said, &quot;I wanted to find one name that meant this area where state lines have not been important. I tried &quot;Land of the Sioux,&quot; but that was too long, so &quot;Siouxland&quot; was born&quot; in 1946.

The following year, it was first used in the prologue to Manfred&#x27;s third novel, &quot;This Is the Year&quot;—
&quot;The cock robin winged on, north.&quot;

&quot;At last, in late March, he arrived in Siouxland. He wheeled over the oak-crested, doming hills north of Sioux City, flew up the Big Sioux River, resting in elms and basswoods...&quot;
&quot;Time&quot; magazine, reviewing the novel on 31 March 1947, introduced &quot;Siouxland&quot; to its readers by quoting from the book: &quot;By a river in the Siouxland he stood weeping.&quot; By the summer of 1948, Alex Stoddard, sports editor of the &quot;Sioux City Journal,&quot; had begun referring to &quot;Siouxland teams.&quot; Soon after Manfred&#x27;s fictional naming of Siouxland, commercial and political entities adopted the name and made it widely known.

Orlyn A. Swartz, who came to Sioux City in 1948, purchased the local office of O&#x27;Dea Finance Co. and renamed it Siouxland Finance Co. Swartz told &quot;Book Remarks&quot; that the idea was so new that he asked Harold Murphey, of the Chamber of Commerce, if there would be any objection to using the name. What was perhaps the first business application of &quot;Siouxland&quot; was still in use after four decades (in 1991), in Siouxland Insurance Agency, a successor company.

A sampling of telephone directories (completed in 1991) showed two businesses using &quot;Siouxland&quot; in 1950 and nine in 1953, two of which were spelled &quot;Sioux Land&quot;. By contrast, in the 1990 Sioux City telephone directory there were sixty-five listings under &quot;Siouxland&quot;, including spelling variants (&quot;Sioux Land&quot;, &quot;Sooland&quot;, and &quot;Soo Land&quot;), and another eleven in the 1990 Sioux Falls telephone directory.

==Boundaries==
As a vernacular region, the boundaries of Siouxland have no official designation. As the term is frequently used by Sioux City media, it is often assumed that &quot;Siouxland&quot; is roughly synonymous with the Sioux City area, but not everyone agrees with this assumption. The Sioux City media bias towards Sioux City was illustrated in January 1990, when a letter to the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot; asked, &quot;Just where is Siouxland?&quot; The writer, a resident of Ida Grove, was disputing that the &quot;first baby born in Siouxland&quot; was born in Sioux City at 3:30 a.m. on January 1, because a baby was born in Ida Grove at 1:42 a.m. the same day.

As residents of the Sioux Falls area wanted their own regional name, they adopted &quot;Sioux Empire.&quot; Manfred, in a 1991 interview with &quot;Book Remarks&quot;, expressed disappointment that so many residents of Sioux Falls believed &quot;Siouxland&quot; to mean &quot;Sioux City&quot;, to the extent that they came up with a new name of &quot;Sioux Empire.&quot; Manfred drew a map of &quot;Siouxland&quot; for the cover of &quot;This Is the Year&quot;; his version encompassed the lower Big Sioux River drainage basin. At that time, Manfred lived in Luverne, Minnesota, which he considered to be part of &quot;Siouxland&quot;.

In 1995, Siouxland Libraries—sometimes called the Siouxland Public Library—was created out of the merger of the Sioux Falls Public Library and the Minnehaha County Rural Public Library.

&quot;Just where is Siouxland?&quot; The answer varies geographically. Like most vernacular regions, &quot;Siouxland&quot; is more-or-less where one wants it to be—or where popular perception places it.

==Major cities==
The two largest Siouxland cities are Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Sioux City, Iowa. Another prominent city in this area is Norfolk, Nebraska, a major commercial area of northeast Nebraska, but this city is marginally in what is considered to be Siouxland.

===Sioux Empire===
The area around Sioux Falls (the metropolitan area including the counties of Minnehaha County, Lincoln County, McCook County, and Turner County) is often referred to as the &quot;Sioux Empire.&quot; This region (which includes adjacent areas in the southwest corner of Minnesota) is part of Manfred&#x27;s original conception of Siouxland.

<doc id="1223450" wikidata="Q286135" url="?curid=1223450" title="D. Michael Quinn">
<text>Dennis Michael Quinn (March 26, 1944 – April 21, 2021) was an American historian who focused on the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was a professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1976 until he resigned in 1988. At the time, his work concerned church involvement with plural marriage after the 1890 Manifesto, when new polygamous marriages were officially prohibited. He was excommunicated from the church as one of the September Six and afterwards was openly gay. Quinn nevertheless identified as a Latter-day Saint and continued to believe in many LDS teachings, though he did not actively practice the faith.

==Early life==
Quinn was born in Pasadena, California, and grew up in adjacent Glendale. He wanted to be a medical doctor and in preparation became a nursing aide at his local hospital during his senior year in high school, with a full load of patients. In college, however, he failed his pre-med program and so changed majors to English and philosophy.

==Church and military service==
Quinn served a mission for the LDS Church for two years in England under Marion D. Hanks. Quinn graduated with a BA in English literature from BYU. After he graduated, Quinn served for three years in the US Army during the Vietnam War, with eighteen months of training as a military intelligence agent followed by eighteen months in Munich, Germany. During his military service, he was first accepted into Duke University for graduate studies in English but after he left the Army, he realized that he preferred his hobby of studying history over other subjects. Instead he enrolled at the University of Utah, graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in history.

Quinn applied for a graduate program in history in Yale Graduate School where he graduated with a PhD degree in 1976. After graduation, he took a job teaching and researching history at BYU. He also worked as a research assistant to Church Historian Leonard J. Arrington for eighteen months. Quinn taught at BYU until he resigned in January 1988 due to the ongoing pressure from some authorities who wanted to see him leave. At BYU, he was named &quot;best professor&quot; by one graduating class.

==Excommunication and later life==
On September 26, 1993, Quinn was excommunicated from the LDS Church as one of the September Six. Quinn had been summoned to a disciplinary council to answer charges of &quot;conduct unbecoming a member of the Church and apostasy,&quot; including &quot;&#x27;very sensitive and highly confidential&#x27; matters that were not related to Michael&#x27;s historical writings.&quot; Lavina Fielding Anderson has suggested that the &quot;allusion to Michael&#x27;s sexual orientation, which Michael had not yet made public, was unmistakable.&quot; Quinn did not attend the disciplinary council that resulted in his excommunication.

Quinn afterwards published several major studies of the LDS Church hierarchy, including his three-volume work of &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power&quot;, &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power&quot;, and &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Wealth and Corporate Power&quot;. He also authored the 1996 book &quot;Same-Sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-Century Americans: A Mormon Example&quot;, which argues that homosexuality was common among early Mormons and was not seen as a serious sin or transgression.

Despite his excommunication and critical writings, Quinn still considered himself a Latter-day Saint and believed in Mormonism, though he disagreed with certain policies and doctrines. The &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; said he had &quot;the most literal faith&quot; of any member of the September Six and believed in &quot;angelic visits, miracles, divine intervention, gold plates, [and] Christ in America.&quot;

In an April 2006 article for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, reporter Daniel Golden wrote that Quinn could no longer be hired because almost all the funding for professorships in Mormon studies comes from Mormon donors. For example, Arizona State University administrators vetoed the department of religious studies in its recommendation to hire Quinn. Its faculty believed that officials feared alienating the 3,700 Mormon students and offending Ira A. Fulton, a powerful Mormon donor who, according to Golden, has called Quinn a &quot;nothing person.&quot;

In 2007, Quinn was interviewed in the PBS documentary &quot;The Mormons&quot;.

Quinn died on an unknown date between April 10–21, 2021 in Rancho Cucamonga, California.

==Writings on Mormonism==
Quinn&#x27;s research topics, both before and after his excommunication, were in-depth revisions of traditional accounts of Mormon history that were grounded in primary source material. The Mormon History Association has recognized his writings as &quot;foundational to the field&quot; of Mormon studies. Three of his most influential books, which also generated intense controversy, are &quot;Early Mormonism and the Magic World View&quot;, &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power&quot;, and &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power&quot;.

===&quot;Early Mormonism and the Magic World View&quot;===
&quot;Early Mormonism and the Magic World View&quot; is an exhaustive recounting of the role of 19th-century New England folk magic lore in Joseph Smith&#x27;s early visions and in the development of the Book of Mormon. Quinn argues that Smith&#x27;s early religious experiences were inextricably intermingled with ritual, supernaturalism, and white magic. Evidence is drawn from friendly firsthand sources, unfriendly firsthand sources, material artifacts, and parallels in ideas. All four sources agree that Smith used a collection of different seer stones in searching for buried treasure supposedly left by pirates, Spaniards, and Native Americans. The evidence suggests that these same seer stones were one of the primary tools used by Smith in translating the Book of Mormon. Likewise, evidence from all four categories of sources supports the idea that Smith approved of the use of rods for dowsing activities. In support of this, Quinn points out that the first published version of an early revelation told Oliver Cowdery that a dowsing rod (referred to as a &quot;rod of nature&quot;) would serve as a means of receiving divine revelation. Other claims, including Smith&#x27;s purported involvement in astrology are less supported by evidence.

Various historians, both within and without the Mormon faith, consider this book an important contribution in understanding early Mormon history, and supporters feel the work is groundbreaking. In a 1990 book review in &quot;Church History&quot;, Klaus J. Hansen calls Quinn&#x27;s book a &quot;magisterial study&quot; and a &quot;tour de force&quot; and notes the book&#x27;s &quot;truly stunning mass of evidence&quot; in favor of its position. John L. Brooke made Quinn&#x27;s argument the starting point of his study, &quot;The Refiner&#x27;s Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644–1844&quot;.

Mormon and non-Mormon scholars have criticized the book as relying too heavily on environmental parallels without a proven connection to Smith&#x27;s ideas and behavior; that it accepts at face value the disputed Howe–Hurlbut affidavits about Smith&#x27;s reputation and behavior in New York and a late 19th-century newspaper account of a money-digging agreement involving Smith and his father. William J. Hamblin states in his review of the book that &quot;the fact that Quinn could not discover a single primary source written by Latter-day Saints that makes any positive statement about magic is hardly dissuasive to a historian of Quinn&#x27;s inventive capacity&quot;. An additional criticism suggests that the concept of magic is flawed and inherently subjective; it implies that Smith&#x27;s use of seer stones and dowsing rods was superstitious or fraudulent rather than divine. However, some of Quinn&#x27;s critics acknowledge that the book is &quot;richly documented&quot; and an obligatory starting point for any discussion of Smith&#x27;s involvement in 19th-century folkloric practices.

===&quot;The Mormon Hierarchy&quot;===
The three volumes of &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy&quot; provide a comprehensive secular organizational history of the LDS Church from its founding to modern times, and its influence on current Mormon culture and doctrine. The work emphasizes conflict, coercion, and violence, especially during the 19th century (see Danites, Mountain Meadows massacre, Blood Atonement and the Mormon wars). Quinn asserts the view that during the 20th century the church was increasingly bureaucratized and highlights its role in right-wing anti-communism during the 1950s and the 1960s, efforts against the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, political work against same-sex marriage and some forms of anti-discrimination legislation, the church&#x27;s mid-century financial crisis, conflicts over policies such as the so-called &quot;baseball baptisms&quot; of youth who knew little about the church, presumed disagreements among church apostles, and extensive business and family interrelationships among leaders.

In a review of &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power&quot; for the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, a Mormon research organization, Duane Boyce states that there are scholarly deficiencies in the work and refers to it as a &quot;betrayal of trust.&quot;

In 2012, Quinn was reported to be working on a book about LDS Church finances and businesses. He said, &quot;The Mormon Church is very different than any other church...Traditional Christianity and Judaism make a clear distinction between what is spiritual and what is temporal, while Mormon theology specifically denies that there is such a distinction.&quot; Regarding management of the church&#x27;s considerable investments, Quinn said, &quot;Several high-ranking church insiders told him that the church&#x27;s finances are so compartmentalized that no single person, not even the president, knows the entirety of its holdings.&quot;

The resulting book was released in 2017 as the third volume in his Mormon Hierarchy series, &quot;Mormon Hierarchy: Wealth and Corporate Power.&quot; In an interview about this book with the Salt Lake Tribune&#x27;s podcast &quot;Mormon Land&quot;, Michael Quinn spoke of the financial structure of the LDS Church as &quot;faith promoting&quot; and &quot;stunning.&quot; He finished the 50 minute interview by saying, &quot;There is no comparison to the volunteerism of the highest officers of the LDS Church compared to the highest officers of any non-profit you can look at.&quot;

===&quot;Same-Sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-Century Americans: A Mormon Example&quot;===

Quinn has argued that homosexual relationships, between both men and women, were quietly accepted by the LDS Church and its leadership up until the 1940s. This theme has arisen in Quinn&#x27;s &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power&quot; and is the central topic of &quot;Same-Sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-Century Americans: A Mormon Example&quot;. Two Mormon scholars have disputed Quinn&#x27;s work, calling it a distortion of church history; these writers claim that Quinn completely misrepresented the facts and deny any acceptance of homosexuality from previous leaders. They suggest that Quinn has conflated an absence of early church proscriptions of homosexuality with tacit acceptance of same, and state that the current leadership of the church &quot;is entirely consistent with the teachings of past leaders and with the scriptures.&quot;

==Selected works==
Quinn has edited a prominent collection of major publications in Mormon history over the last 40 years, &quot;The New Mormon History: Revisionist Essays on the Past&quot;. He has written and spoken of the parallels between 19th-century American attacks on Mormon polygamy and 20th- and 21st-century Mormon attacks on same-sex marriage. He has also presented an overview of recent biographies of Joseph Smith, suggesting that these biographies maintain an artificial division between Smith the treasure seeker and Smith the prophet.

Quinn was also a noteworthy biographer of the mid-20th-century Latter-day Saint leader J. Reuben Clark, Jr. In two biographical volumes on the Mormon apostle, Quinn emphasized Clark&#x27;s professional preeminence, his committed and sometimes inflexible leadership, his persistent pacifism and personal struggles.

After Quinn’s death his children found his unpublished memoir at his home, the “Chosen Path” and they found a publisher that published it in 2023;

<text>Arlette Pinheiro Esteves Torres (née da Silva; born 16 October 1929), known by her stage name Fernanda Montenegro (), is a Brazilian actress. Considered by many as the greatest Brazilian actress of all time, she is often referred to as the &quot;grande dame&quot; of Brazilian theater, cinema, and performing arts. For her work in &quot;Central Station&quot; (1998), she became the first Brazilian to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as the first actress nominated for an Academy Award for a performance in a Portuguese language film. Her daughter was also nominated in 2025. In addition, she was the first Brazilian to win the International Emmy in the category of Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Sweet Mother&quot; (2014).

Among the various national and international awards she has received in a career spanning more than sixty years, she was awarded in 1999 her country&#x27;s highest civilian honor, the National Order of Merit, &quot;in recognition of her outstanding work in the Brazilian performing arts,&quot; delivered by then-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In addition to having been awarded the Molière Prize five times, Fernanda Montenegro is a three-time recipient of the Governor Award of the State of São Paulo. She also won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival 1998 for her performance as &quot;Dora&quot; in &quot;Central Station&quot; by Walter Salles, a role which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama in 1999, among other distinctions. On television, she was the first actress hired by TV Tupi, in 1951, where she starred in teletheater shows under the direction of Fernando Torres, Sérgio Britto and Flávio Rangel. She made her debut in telenovelas in 1954 with &quot;A Muralha&quot; on RecordTV, where she appeared in other productions as well. She has done work in most of Brazil&#x27;s main broadcasters, such as Band, TV Cultura, RecordTV, and TV Globo (where she remains since 1981), in addition to the extinct TV Excelsior, TV Rio and TV Tupi.

In 2014, she was voted the 15th most influential celebrity in Brazil by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. During the Opening Ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics, Fernanda read the poem &quot;A Flor e a Náusea&quot; by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, dubbed in English by Judi Dench.

On 4 November 2021, she was elected to occupy the Chair number 17 at the Brazilian Academy of Letters, in succession to Affonso Arinos de Mello Franco.

In November 2024, she was recognized by Guinness World Records for achieving the biggest audience in a Philosophy lecture, with over 15,000 people attending an event on 18 August 2024 at the Ibirapuera Park, where Montenegro read &quot;La Cérémonie des Adieux&quot; by Simone de Beauvoir.

==Early life==
Fernanda Montenegro was born as Arlette Pinheiro Esteves da Silva, the daughter of Vitório Esteves da Silva, a mechanic of Portuguese origin, and Carmen Nieddu Pinheiro Esteves da Silva, a housewife, daughter of Italians from the island of Sardinia.

==Career==
===Stage and television career===

In the late 1940s, Montenegro was adapting famous theatre plays to radio. She began her artistic life in the theatre with the play &quot;Alegres Canções nas Montanhas&quot; (&quot;Happy Songs on the Mountain&quot;) in 1950. Among her fellow actors was Fernando Torres, who would soon become her husband. She subsequently worked with other acclaimed actors like Sérgio Britto, Cacilda Becker, Nathalia Timberg, Cláudio Correa e Castro and Ítalo Rossi.
In 1951 she became a TV pioneer in Brazil, working for Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s TV Tupi – the second TV station of South America. She appeared in several plays on TV between 1951 and 1970.

Moving to São Paulo in the early 1960s, Montenegro initially worked solely on theatre. In 1963 she took her first role in a telenovela &quot;Pouco Amor Não é Amor&quot;. A succession of notable telenovela&#x27;s roles followed, mainly her performances in the ensemble piece &quot;A Muralha&quot; (1968), based on the novel by celebrated Brazilian author Dinah Silveira de Queiroz, and &quot;Sangue do Meu Sangue&quot; (1969), a memorable melodrama engraved in Brazilian pop culture, whose stellar cast featured not only Montenegro, but other theatre&#x27;s stars like Sérgio Britto, Cláudio Correa e Castro, Francisco Cuoco, Nicette Bruno and Tônia Carrero.

Throughout the 1970s Montenegro moved away from television, rather focusing on her theatre and film career. Still, a televised performance in Euripides’ classic play Medea, in 1973, was lauded by reviewers. It was only in the very late 1970s that Montenegro would once again engage in a substantial television effort, with &quot;Cara a Cara&quot; (1979), for which she won the Best Actress in Television Award by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics.

The 1980s marked Montenegro&#x27;s return to television in full force. She appeared in telenovelas such as &quot;Baila Comigo&quot; (1981), &quot;Brilhante&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cambalacho&quot; (1986), and struck a massive hit with &quot;Guerra dos Sexos&quot; (1983), a light-hearted comedy about the constant bickering men and women experience in different stages of romantic relationships. In the latter, Montenegro once again left a significant impression in Brazilian pop culture, starring in a now-immortalized food fight scene, opposite Paulo Autran. Throughout this decade, Montenegro won her second and third Best Actress in Television Awards, by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics, for her work in &quot;Brilhante&quot; and &quot;Guerra dos Sexos&quot;.

The early 1990s proved once again to be a time of success in television for Montenegro, as she took on roles in two other smash hits, the popular primetime telenovelas &quot;Rainha da Sucata&quot; (1990) and &quot;O Dono do Mundo&quot; (1991), both Brazilian pop culture favorites. Years later, she once again gained artistic distinction, appearing on the critically acclaimed mini-series &quot;Incidente em Antares&quot; (1994), an adaptation of the book by one of Brazilian Literature&#x27;s greatest novelists, Érico Veríssimo.

In 1997, Montenegro&#x27;s string of critical and audience triumphs came to an abrupt halt as her portrayal of the lead role in the telenovela &quot;Zazá&quot;, a much anticipated return to comedy, couldn&#x27;t live up to either reviewers&#x27; or the viewing public&#x27;s expectations. After a series of changes in attempt to salvage it from absolute failure, still facing overall rejection, the show was cut short and quickly wrapped. Despite its being a considerable letdown, &quot;Zazá&quot; was soon eclipsed by the monumental success Montenegro&#x27;s film career witnessed with the release of &quot;Central Station&quot;.

In spite of a successful minor appearance as Mary (mother of Jesus) in the mini-series &quot;O Auto da Compadecida&quot; (1999), later re-cut into a theatrical film (internationally known as &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Will&quot;), Montenegro&#x27;s television career struggled in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2001, another attempt was made in telenovela comedy with &quot;As Filhas da Mãe&quot;, which covered the backstage of Brazilian Fashion Industry. Short of a celebrated scene, early on, which featured Montenegro&#x27;s character winning an Oscar, the telenovela was, once more, a flop. Lackluster ratings and overall negative reviews led to its swift cancellation. Nevertheless, Montenegro still managed to be nominated as Best Actress in the Contigo Awards, which laureates excellence in Brazilian telenovelas.

The following year, Montenegro shifted towards primetime drama, opting for a minor role in the first stage of the telenovela &quot;Esperança&quot; (2002). Although Montenegro herself earned positive reviews, &quot;Esperança&quot; was a major failure, generally panned by critics and despised by audiences, setting a record for an all-time low in ratings for a primetime telenovela televised by TV Globo, the broadcasting channel of Brazil&#x27;s most powerful telecommunications conglomerate. Due to Montenegro&#x27;s continued success in film, as well as her status as one of the most cherished artists and personalities in Brazil, these disappointments tended to be minimized, often regarded as minor blots in an extended résumé of significant successes.

Montenegro returned to television&#x27;s good graces in a supporting role as the exploitive stepmother of the lead character in the ensemble piece mini-series &quot;Hoje É Dia de Maria&quot; (2005), a coming-of-age tale set in a fantasy world, positively reviewed for its inventiveness, its stunning art direction and overall production design, as well as its acting. Montenegro scored her second nomination as Best Actress in the Contigo Awards, while the mini-series garnered two nominations for the International Emmy Awards and won the Grand Prize of the Critics of the São Paulo Association of Art Critics Award.

The following year, Montenegro returned to primetime drama, taking on the female lead role in &quot;Belíssima&quot; (2006), which also offered a backstage view to Brazilian Fashion Industry, only in a much more earnest and cruel perspective than in her previous work &quot;As Filhas da Mãe&quot; (2001). Starring as the shrewd calculating villainess, Bia Falcão, Montenegro was applauded by critics and audiences alike, delivering a solid, sophisticated performance while handling an unapologetic, uncharismatic character, whose story twist was pivotal to the development of the main plot. For this portrayal, Montenegro finally won her first Contigo Award for Best Actress, and also her fourth Best Actress in Television Award by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics.

Following her streak of well-received roles, Montenegro returned to television in 2008, taking a supporting role, as Dona Iraci, in the critically and publicly acclaimed primetime mini-Series &quot;Queridos Amigos&quot;, based on the book &quot;Aos Amigos&quot;, by Portuguese novelist Maria Adelaide Amaral, an ensemble piece that tells a fictional reconstitution of personal experiences of Amaral and a group of close friends, set during a moment of political turbulence in the Brazilian transition from a military dictatorship to a democratic regime.

In 2010, she starred in the telenovela &quot;Passione&quot;, where she played Beth Gouveia.

In 2012, Montenegro starred in the latest episode of the miniseries &quot;As Brasileiras&quot; as an actress without much talent named Mary Torres. Determined to make the success they have always dreamed, Mary ends vontando television to revive his career.

In &quot;Sweet Mother&quot;, she plays Dona Picucha, an 85-year-old widow who confronts life with good humor and who knows how to take advantage of all the difficulties she face. “‘Sweet Mother’ has one foot in reality and the other in fantasy. The reality of a country of youths where there are more and more old people and many doubts about how to deal with them. The fantasy of the comedy, the music, the poetry which become a believable reality. Picucha is 85 years old and still does not know what she wants to be when she grows up. I don&#x27;t either,” Fernanda said. Montenegro was awarded for her role, and became the first Brazilian actress to win an Emmy Award. She would return to play the same character, now in the TV series of the same name, which was aired in 2014 by Globo. She was again nominated for an Emmy in 2015, and the series was awarded Best Comedy at the 43rd International Emmy Awards Gala.
In 2013, at age 85 years, Montenegro returns to television in the remake of &quot;Saramandaia&quot;.

In the same year, Montenegro had participated in the cast of the telenovela &quot;Babilônia&quot;, written by Gilberto Braga, in the role of Teresa, a homosexual lawyer who maintains a relationship with the character Nathalia Timberg, Estela.

===Film career===
Montenegro&#x27;s film career was launched in the mid-1960s. Her debut came in 1965, as Zulmira, in the movie &quot;A Falecida&quot; (internationally known as &quot;The Death&quot; and released in the U.S. as &quot;The Deceased&quot;). The film was a cinematic adaptation of the play, by the greatest of Brazilian dramatists, Nélson Rodrigues, and earned its female lead, amongst positive reviews, her first distinction as a film actress, as Montenegro won the Candango Trophy as Best Actress in the Brasília Festival of Brazilian Cinema.

Throughout the 1970s, Montenegro was featured in a series of other movies, but none seemed to match the degree of acclaim as her debut, until, in 1978, she starred as Elvira Barata, opposite Paulo Gracindo, in Arnaldo Jabor&#x27;s &quot;Tudo Bem&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot;). The movie earned positive reviews, eventually winning the top prize at the Brasília Festival of Brazilian Cinema, taking the Candango Trophy for Best Film. Although receiving considerable appraisal, Montenegro&#x27;s performance missed any major awards.

As her next big screen role, in 1981, Montenegro starred as Romana in &quot;&quot; (internationally known as &quot;They Don&#x27;t Wear Black Tie&quot;), based on a play by the late Gianfrancesco Guarnieri, who was also her co-star in the movie. The movie proved to be a big domestic hit, earning Guarnieri the Award as Best Actor in Film by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics, and, most significantly, a movie of international notice, landing major awards in film festivals all around the world, including the Grand Coral First Prize in the Havana Film Festival, as well as the Grand Jury Special Prize and the FIPRESCI Prize in the Venice Film Festival.

Focusing in television during the 1980s, Montenegro&#x27;s film exposure was limited throughout the remaining of the decade, but she still participated in a minor role as Carlota, a religious practitioner of Umbanda (a syncretic belief system very popular in Brazil), in 1985&#x27;s &quot;A Hora da Estrela&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Hour of the Star&quot;), a movie that was lauded by critics both domestically – snatching six Candango Trophies in the Brasília Festival of Brazilian Cinema, including Best Film, Director, Actor (José Dumont) and Actress (Marcélia Cartaxo) and, internationally, earning the Grand Coral First Prize in the Havana Film Festival, as well as three major awards in the Berlin Film Festival: the International Confederation of Art House Cinemas Award, the OCIC Award and the Silver Berlin Bear for Best Actress (awarded to fellow co-star Marcélia Cartaxo).

Montenegro&#x27;s film career hiatus would only be broken in 1994, emerging in a segment titled &quot;Samba do Grande Amor&quot; of the film &quot;Veja Esta Canção&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Rio&#x27;s Love Song&quot;), which garnered its director Carlos &quot;Cacá&quot; Diegues a Best Director Award in the Havana Film Festival. She then moved, in 1997, to a small appearance in &quot;O Que é Isso, Companheiro?&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Four Days in September&quot;), which starred American actor Alan Arkin and chronicled the kidnapping of American consul Charles Burke Elbrick by rebellious political activists who opposed the military dictatorship in Brazil, based on the memoirs of Brazilian politician Fernando Gabeira. The movie had significant international repercussion, welcoming nominations to the Golden Bear in the Berlin International Film Festival and to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

===&quot;Central do Brasil&quot;===
In 1998, Montenegro starred in &quot;Central do Brasil&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Central Station&quot;), as Dora, her most internationally famous and prestigious role. The movie fared well domestically, winning four awards by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics (including Best Film, Director and Actress in Film – Montenegro&#x27;s first, after winning thrice for her television career), and achieved international acclaim unprecedented for any Brazilian film. &quot;Central Station&quot; debuted to undisputed praise in the Berlin Film Festival, eventually earning three of its major awards: The Golden Berlin Bear for Best Film, the Special Prize by the Ecumenical Jury and the Silver Berlin Bear for Best Actress for Montenegro.

Successively, many other honors were bestowed upon the film, as it won five awards at the Havana Film Festival, including the Special Jury Prize and the Best Actress Award to Montenegro, as well as several other prizes for Best Foreign Film, including a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, awards by the Argentine Film Critics Association, the National Board of Review, the San Sebastián International Film Festival, the Spain Film Critics Association, the Spain Cinema Writers Circle and the Satellite Awards, among others. Other high-profile Best Foreign Film nominations included the César Award, the Independent Spirit Award, and an Academy Award nomination as Best Film in a Foreign Language.

Montenegro was honored on numerous occasions, earning additional Best Actress awards from the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival, the National Board of Review and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and others. She was also nominated for a Golden Satellite Award, for a Golden Globe and for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a feat which gave Montenegro the distinction of being the first (Brazilian and) Latin American actress to be bestowed with such an honor by the Academy. She is also the first person nominated for a performance in the Portuguese language. In 2025, her own daughter, Fernanda Torres, accomplished that feat being the second Brazilian person to be nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards for the movie &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (2024) (also directed by &quot;Central Station&quot; director, Walter Salles).

===21st century===

Montenegro&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Central Station&quot; marked her return to the work of Nélson Rodrigues, as she took on a supporting role in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Gêmeas&quot;, directed by her own son-in-law, Andrucha Waddington, and starred by her own daughter, Fernanda Torres. The film fared relatively well domestically, earning Torres a Candango Trophy for Best Actress in the Brasília Festival of Brazilian Cinema and a nomination for Best Actress in the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize, but failed to gain any substantial recognition internationally. In 2000, the celebrated television mini-series &quot;O Auto da Compadecida&quot;, in which Montenegro appeared as the Holy Mary, was re-cut into a film of same title (internationally known as &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Will&quot;) and released to movie theaters to significantly appreciative domestic appraisal. It eventually won four awards at the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize, including Best Director, Best Actor (Matheus Nachtergaele) and Best Screenplay (surprisingly, it lost the Best Picture award), but also failed to launch a noteworthy international career.

In 2004, Montenegro&#x27;s film career was once again in full force. She returned to the Berlin Film Festival with &quot;O Outro Lado da Rua&quot; (internationally known as &quot;The Other Side of the Street&quot;), which landed stellar reviews and garnered the International Confederation of Art House Cinemas Award. Montenegro herself was also honored, winning the Horizons Award in the San Sebastian International Film Festival and the Best Actress Award in the Tribeca Film Festival. Domestically, the film also fared well, landing six nominations to the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize, with Montenegro winning the Best Actress award.

The same year, she also took a supporting role in &quot;Redentor&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Redeemer&quot;), directed by her son, Cláudio Torres, and co-starred by her husband Fernando Torres. The movie proved to be a smash hit domestically, earning rave reviews and scoring nine nominations in the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize (winning one for Best Director), but failed to produce an expressive splash internationally. Still in 2004, Montenegro once again landed a supporting role, playing Leocádia Prestes, mother of Brazilian communist leader Luiz Carlos Prestes, and mother-in-law of Jewish-German socialist revolutionary Olga Benário in the biopic &quot;Olga&quot;, based on the book by Brazilian biographer Fernando Morais. The movie was received with mixed reviews by critics, often praised for its technical merits (mainly its cinematography, make-up art, costume design and art direction) and panned for its narrative and directing choices. It still fared strongly in the box-office, though, and scored nine nominations in the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize, earning three technical awards (Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Make-Up). &quot;Olga&quot; was also chosen, eventually, as the film to represent Brazil in the Oscar race in pursuit of a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, but it did not make it to the final five nominees.
2005 saw Montenegro&#x27;s return to lead, as she took on three different roles in the feminist epic saga &quot;Casa de Areia&quot; (internationally known as &quot;The House of Sand&quot;), opposite her own daughter, Fernanda Torres, with whom she alternated the same roles. The movie had a strong display domestically, earning rave reviews and special distinction to Montenegro&#x27;s performance. It garnered 12 nominations to the Cinema Brazil Grand Prize (including Best Actress for Montenegro), earning three technical awards (the same as &quot;Olga&quot;). The movie displayed the potential to develop an international career, as it earned two nominations to the Satellite Awards and earned an Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize in the Sundance Film Festival, but its campaign was crippled when Brazilian critics turned their support to &quot;Cinema, Aspirinas e Urubus&quot; (internationally known as &quot;Cinema, Aspirins and Vultures&quot;), choosing it to represent Brazil in the Oscar race.

In late 2006, Montenegro garnered attention for leading a movement of film artists and investors who firmly opposed a Congressional Bill that reduced federal incentives in cultural programmes, reallocating such funds to public investments in the fields of sports and leisure. On December 14, 2006, Montenegro directly addressed the Brazilian Senate, strongly criticizing the legislation and famously asserting &quot;Culture is, above all, a social need. It is not a frivolity.&quot; For such deeds, as well as her overall career in film, Montenegro earned, in 2007, in the Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival, an Honorary Award, as a Latin American Character of the Culture. Also in 2007, Montenegro played Tránsito Ariza, in &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;, an adaptation of the novel by the winner of the Nobel Prize of Literature, Gabriel García Marquez. Albeit a minor role, it marked Montenegro&#x27;s first performance in an English language spoken feature.

In 2012, Montenegro starred in the short film &quot;A Dama do Estácio&quot; directed by Edward Ades and in 2013 participated in the film cast &quot;Time and the Wind&quot; an adaptation of the novel by Erico Verissimo with Thiago Lacerda, Marjorie Estiano and Cléo Pires.

In 2024, at 95 years old, Montenegro entered the Guinness World Record for the largest audience during a philosophical reading for her stage reading of French writer and feminist activist Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s autobiography &quot;La Cérémonie des adieux (Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre, 1981)&quot; at Ibirapuera Park drawing an audience of 15,000 people.

Also in 2024, Montenegro and her daughter Fernanda Torres portrayed Eunice Paiva at different stages of her life in the acclaimed film I&#x27;m Still Here, directed by Walter Salles, who also directed Montenegro in Central Station.

==Personal life==
Montenegro was married to Fernando Torres from 1954 until his death in 2008. They had two children: Fernanda Torres (b. 1965), who won the Best Actress prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama in 2025, and film director Cláudio Torres (b. 1962).

Regarding the adoption of a stage name, the actress has stated that she chose &quot;Fernanda&quot; simply because of its sonority, whilst &quot;Montenegro&quot; was the surname of her family&#x27;s doctor.

<doc id="1223458" wikidata="Q7688819" url="?curid=1223458" title="Taunton sleeping car fire">
<text>In the early hours of 6 July 1978, a fire broke out in a sleeping car train near Taunton, Somerset, England. Twelve people were killed and 15 were injured. The fire was caused by an electric heater that had been obstructed by sacks of dirty bed linen, causing it to overheat. Most deaths were due to smoke inhalation.

In response to the incident, British Rail adopted various fire safety measures on the newly introduced Mark 3 passenger carriages.

== Background ==

The fire started in a British Railways Mark 1 sleeping car (no. W2437) which had been built in 1960, at which time trains in the UK were mostly hauled by steam locomotives, which provided steam for heating passenger accommodation. Diesel locomotives of the period were fitted with boilers so that they could be used with existing coaches. However, with steam locomotives gone by the 1970s, and with boilers proving unreliable and expensive to maintain, the decision was made to change to electric train heating (ETH). W2437 was converted in 1976, with an electric heater being installed in the vestibule.

The Class 47-hauled 22:30 sleeping car express from Penzance to Paddington on 5 July 1978 was scheduled to pick up two sleeping cars at Plymouth; this arrangement was so that passengers joining the train there could go to bed without having to wait for the main service to arrive at around midnight.

The main store for bed linen on the Plymouth service was at Old Oak Common depot near London Paddington. Used bedding from Plymouth was previously transported in the guards van of the Plymouth portion, but in 1977 that vehicle was removed from the formation. Instead, the dirty linen was stacked in plastic bags in the vestibule of W2437, against the heater.

== Events ==
The train arrived at Plymouth from Penzance at 23:50. It was coupled up to the Plymouth sleeping cars (which included W2437) and the ETH was turned on at 00:15. The train departed on time at 00:30 and made scheduled stops at Newton Abbot and Exeter. Nobody who saw the train noticed anything amiss, but the bags of linen were now heating up. As they smouldered they began to give off toxic gases, including carbon monoxide. The ventilation system drew fresh air from the vestibule, and the gases were sucked into the system and into each berth.

A major fire developed and the train was stopped at 02:41 near Silk Mill signal box about a mile short of the station in Taunton, Somerset, by the communication cord being pulled. By that time, most of the victims were already dead from carbon monoxide poisoning. A small number of passengers awoke and were able to escape, although they had considerable difficulty in doing so due to the smoke and heat. The sleeping car attendant of the Plymouth coaches could only shout a warning to a few of the occupants before he was overcome by smoke; it was the attendant in the adjacent coach who pulled the communication cord. The victims as well as other injured passengers were taken to the nearby Musgrove Park Hospital for treatment.

A twelfth passenger, a Belgian national, died from pneumonia in August, having never regained consciousness.

== Consequences ==
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster David Penhaligon, the Liberal MP for Truro who regularly used the West Country sleeper stated in the House of Commons that &quot;All the doors&quot; on the train were &quot;locked between carriages&quot; and that all the external doors were locked except for the door where the attendant was. He also claimed that windows on the train which were supposed to be able to be opened rarely worked. These remarks echoed claims by passengers that locked doors had hampered escape efforts. In the same debate another West Country MP Robin Maxwell-Hyslop, the Conservative MP for Tiverton pointed out that 111 years earlier an inspector reporting on &quot;the Irish Mail crash&quot; - which actually was in 1868 - had warned that locking doors at the end of sleeping cars could result in passenger deaths and asked &quot;should we not have learned by now?&quot;

Initial reports showed that fire crews had difficulty during the rescue operation because doors on the train were locked. This was against the rules, but it was commonplace for attendants to lock the end doors of the pair of coaches that they were responsible for. This meant that attendants could greet passengers on arrival, and it helped to keep out intruders. Following this discovery, BR made it absolutely clear that all doors were to be left unlocked at all times.

The Taunton fire occurred just as new Mark 3 sleeping cars were at the design stage. The decision was taken to install state-of-the art fire prevention measures including sophisticated warning systems, fire retardant materials, multilingual warning placards and revised emergency procedures.

<text>Movsar Buharovich Barayev (Suleimanov) (; 26 October 1979 – 26 October 2002), earlier known as Suleimanov, was a Chechen Islamist militia leader during the Second Chechen War, who led the seizure of a Moscow theater that led to the deaths of over 170 people by Russian special forces.

==Life==
Movsar Barayev, born 1979, was the nephew of the Chechen warlord Arbi Barayev who allegedly worked under FSB guidance. After his uncle&#x27;s death in June 2001 until his own, Movsar was the leader of a Chechen terrorist militia known as the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment (SPIR). Mosvar Barayev was said to be a sworn enemy of the Chechen leader and elected president, Aslan Maskhadov. He used the &quot;nom-de-guerre&quot; of &quot;Yassir&quot;.

He was incorrectly reported by the command of the Russian forces in Chechnya to have been killed on 21 August 2001, and again on 12 October 2002, eleven days prior to the Moscow theater crisis (this report of Barayev&#x27;s death came from Colonel Boris Podoprigora, deputy commander of Russia&#x27;s Joint Group Forces). It was also claimed that two months before the hostage-taking, the Russian GRU military intelligence had arrested Barayev and contained him &quot;until his release had provided leads to the hostage taking at the Dubrovka theatre&quot;.

==Death==
On 23 October 2002, Barayev and a mysterious man known as &quot;Abu Bakar&quot; led a group of forty SPIR militants and their family members (who had dubbed themselves &quot;the suicide squad from the 29th Division&quot;) to seize the theater in the Russian capital Moscow, demanding negotiations with Russian authorities for an end to the second war in Chechnya, withdrawal of Russian forces and Chechen independence, threatening to execute his hostages.

Movsar Barayev was killed on the third day of the siege, when the Russian FSB special forces stormed the theater. He died on his 23rd birthday. Barayev&#x27;s bloodied corpse was shown by the Russian TV lying on the ground of the theater amid broken glass with an intact bottle of cognac near his hand. Later, the Russian authorities said his body was secretly buried in an undisclosed location.

<text>The Silos is an American rock band formed by Walter Salas-Humara and Bob Rupe in New York City, United States in 1985.

==History==

Prior to starting the Silos, Salas-Humara had been a member of The Vulgar Boatmen, and Bob Rupe was in Florida bands The Roll N Pinz, The Cichlids, Crank and The Bobs, as well as Screaming Sneakers. The Silos put out the independently released album &quot;About Her Steps&quot; in 1986, which received a warm critical reception. The band&#x27;s 1987 follow-up album, &quot;Cuba&quot;, also independently released, received even more recognition. The Silos were named Best New Artist in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Cuba&quot; continues to be cited as highly influential among alternative country artists. The band subsequently signed to RCA Records and released &quot;The Silos&quot;, produced by Salas-Humara and Rupe along with Peter Moore. Commonly referred to as &quot;the bird album&quot; or &quot;The One With The Bird On The Cover,&quot; &quot;The Silos&quot; led to the band&#x27;s network TV debut appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

Salas-Humara quit the band following the release of &quot;The Silos&quot;, and purchased the rights to The Silos name from Rupe in 1991, thus dissolving the partnership. Subsequent albums included &quot;Hasta La Victoria&quot; (1992), &quot;Susan Across The Ocean&quot; (1994), &quot;Heater&quot; and its remix companion &quot;Cooler&quot; (both 1998). After &quot;Heater&quot; was recorded, Salas-Humara turned the band into a three piece with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel guitar and Konrad Meissner on drum and backing vocals. The subsequent records were &quot;Laser Beam Next Door&quot; (2001), &quot;When The Telephone Rings&quot; (2004), and the live &quot;This Highway Is A Circle&quot;. Bloodshot Records released the Silos&#x27; 2007 offering, &quot;Come On Like The Fast Lane&quot;. In 2008, Glackin died. Salas-Humara and Meissner continue to perform with other players. In 2011, the band released &quot;Florizona&quot; with Rod Hohl playing bass, Bruce Martin on keyboards and Jason Victor on guitar.

Salas-Humara has also released the solo albums &quot;Lagartija&quot; (1988) (which also featured Bob Rupe), &quot;Radar&quot; (1995) and most recently, &quot;Curve and Shake&quot; (2014). He joined Alejandro Escovedo and Michael Hall in a side project called the Setters. The novelist and music aficionado Jonathan Lethem called Salas-Humara &quot;a melodic genius, one of our greatest songwriters.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said Salas-Humara &quot;has a deft songwriting touch, creating terse, stripped-down songs as elegant as Shaker furniture.&quot;

Bob Rupe went on to record with House of Freaks, Gutterball, Danny and Dusty and Sparklehorse. Prior to starting Silos he was well established as a producer and engineer in South Florida, handling production for Psycho Daisies, The Chant and The Preachers. He was a member of Cracker from 1994 to 2000 and has appeared as a guest artist on releases by many other artists including Freedy Johnston, Joan Osborne, Steve Wynn, Daniel Johnston and Garrison Starr. Bob Rupe has also mastered records for a variety of artists across many musical styles including Charlie Pickett (&quot;Bar Band Americanus&quot;).

<text>The Valech Report, officially known as The National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture Report, documents instances of abuses committed in Chile between 1973 and 1990 by agents of Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s military regime. Published on November 29, 2004, the report presents the findings of a six-month investigation. A revised version was subsequently released on June 1, 2005. In February 2010, the commission was reopened for a period of eighteen months, during which additional cases were examined.

According to the commission&#x27;s findings, a total of 38,254 individuals were imprisoned for political reasons, with a majority of them subjected to torture. In addition to the cases documented in the earlier Rettig Report, the commission also revealed that thirty individuals had either disappeared or been executed.

The testimonies obtained during the investigation have been classified and will remain confidential for the next fifty years, until 2054. Consequently, these records cannot be utilized in trials pertaining to human rights violations. This stands in contrast to the &quot;Archives of Terror&quot; in Paraguay and Operation Condor. Associations representing former political prisoners have been denied access to the testimonies.

==Commission==

The report was prepared at the request of President Ricardo Lagos by the National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture, which consisted of eight members. The commission was headed by Bishop Sergio Valech and made the report public through the Internet. The members of the commission included María Luisa Sepúlveda as the executive vice president, as well as lawyers Miguel Luis Amunátegui, Luciano Fouillioux, José Antonio Gómez (PRSD president), Lucas Sierra, Álvaro Varela, and psychologist Elizabeth Lira. The commission did not include any representatives of the victims or members of the associations of ex-political prisoners.

To ensure the inclusiveness of their work, the Commission coordinated closely with regional and national organizations of former political prisoners, as well as human rights organizations. Their collaboration aimed to establish contact with relevant individuals who could provide testimonies. To reach a wide audience, advertisements were broadcast on national and local radio and television stations, as well as published in national and local newspapers.

The number of individuals who came forward to testify aligned with the geographic distribution of inhabitants in both the capital city and the provinces.

==Findings==

===First part===
The initial report was based on testimony given to the commission by 35,865 people, of which 27,255 were regarded as &quot;direct victims&quot;. Of these, 94% said they were tortured. Eleven people were born in prison, and ninety-one underage children were detained with their parents (including four unborn babies); these were not considered &quot;direct victims&quot;. Another group of 978 people were minors at the time of their arrest. Four women were pregnant at the time of their arrest and were tortured; their children were considered &quot;direct victims&quot;. A child who was the result of a rape while in prison was also considered a &quot;direct victim&quot;. Victims were detained for six months, on average.

Out of the more than 8,600 rejected cases, 7,290 people requested that their cases be revised. The commission also agreed to investigate a further 166 cases which were not considered the first time around. The updated report added 1,204 new cases, bringing the total number of victims to 28,459. The total number of arrests was 34,690; some people were detained multiple times.

The commission found that approximately 69% of arrests occurred between September 11 and December 31 of 1973, and 19% between January 1973 and August 1977.

===Second part===
Under the presidency of Michelle Bachelet the commission was reopened. It reviewed about 32,000 new requests from February 2010 to August 2011. It was to be open for twelve months but due to the high number of requests it was extended for an additional six months. 9,795 cases of torture and thirty cases of disappearances or executions were certified. The new report was presented to President Sebastián Piñera on August 18, 2011 and released on August 26, 2011.

== Aftermath ==
The state provided lifelong monetary compensation to the victims as well as health and education benefits. These are detailed in Law 19,992 and include: a monthly payment of about 113,000 to 129,000 thousand Chilean pesos (in December 2004 prices, subsequently adjusted for inflation), depending on the victim&#x27;s age; free public healthcare for victims and their parents, spouses or children under twenty-five, or incapacitated children of any age; free education (primary to tertiary) for victims whose studies were interrupted by their imprisonment. There is also a special bonus of four million Chilean pesos for victim&#x27;s children who were born in captivity or who were detained with their parents while they were minors.

Critics of the Valech Report said that families were falsely claiming that their relatives went missing during the 1973–1990 military regime. There had been reports since 2008 that four people, listed as killed or missing, were alive or had died in unrelated circumstances. These cases have raised questions about the system of verification of victims of dictatorships. &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper has reported that a total of 1,183 people were killed, or reported missing and presumed dead, and that their names appear on a special memorial at the General Cemetery of Santiago. Clive Foss, in &quot;The Tyrants: 2500 years of Absolute Power and Corruption&quot;, estimates that 1,500 Chileans were killed or disappeared during the Pinochet regime. Nearly 700 civilians disappeared during the period between 1974 and 1977 after being detained by the Chilean military and police. In October 1977, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Amnesty International had documented the disappearance of approximately 1,500 Chileans since 1973.

Until May 2012, seventy-six agents had been condemned for human rights violations and sixty-seven were convicted: thirty-six from the Army, twenty-seven Carabineros, two from the Air Force, one from the Navy, and one of the PDI. Three condemned agents died and six agents received conditional sentences. The Chilean justice system holds 350 open cases of &quot;disappeared&quot; persons, illegal detainees, and torture victims during the dictatorial rule. These cases involve 700 military and civilian personnel.

<doc id="1223470" wikidata="Q695436" url="?curid=1223470" title="My Kind of Christmas">
<text>My Kind of Christmas is the third studio album and first Christmas album by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was released on October 24, 2000, by RCA Records. The album was recorded from late 1999 to mid 2000, while Aguilera was touring to promote her first two albums: &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; (1999) and &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; (2000). &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; contains cover versions of Christmas standards, such as &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot;, as well as several original recordings, which incorporate dance-pop elements. The album was produced by Ron Fair, the Matrix, Robbie Buchanan, Barry Harris and Chris Cox.

&quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who criticized its musical style and Aguilera&#x27;s vocals. The album peaked at number 28 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having sold 1,015,000 copies. Aguilera appeared on several television shows, such as &quot;The Early Show&quot; and &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, to promote the album, and also performed a special concert for ABC, which was released on DVD in June 2001, as &quot;My Reflection&quot;.

==Background==
Aguilera achieved success following the release of her first two studio albums, &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; in late-2000 respectively, both of which were certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 1999, Aguilera released a cover of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; which found critical and commercial success peaking at number 18 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. Recording for &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; began from early to mid-2000, when Aguilera was touring to support her debut and Spanish-counterpart albums. A cover version of the song &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; from the 1959 musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was recorded for the album but ultimately it was not included on the tracklist and remains unreleased.

==Composition==
&quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; is a Christmas and dance-pop album, which is made up of mainly cover versions of Christmas standards along with several new tracks. The album begins with two original songs. &quot;Christmas Time&quot; is a &quot;catchy, upbeat, pop song, all about the Christmas season&quot; and includes a rap from Aguilera towards the end. &quot;This Year&quot; was co-written by Aguilera and is a hip hop and R&amp;B-infused song where &quot;Aguilera sings about spending the holidays with her sweetheart in a typical xtina fashion&quot;.

This is followed by &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; which are the three soulful and gospel ballads from the album, backed by a 70-piece orchestra. Originally, Etta James was planned to be included as a featured performer on the track &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;. However Dr. John was chosen instead. A portion of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is included at the beginning of &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot; with some deeming the input to be unnecessary. Aguilera&#x27;s cover of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; was received with mixed reviews with comparisons made to Mariah Carey&#x27;s version. Aguilera recites The Lord&#x27;s Prayer during the song which was called &quot;awkward but nice&quot;. &quot;Wales Online&quot; called it one of &quot;the absolute worst Christmas songs of all time&quot;.

&quot;O Holy Night&quot; is followed by Aguilera&#x27;s cover of Celine Dion&#x27;s &quot;These Are the Special Times&quot; from her album of the same name. Aguilera then covers Donny Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;This Christmas&quot;, which received praise for its originality. &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, previously released in late-1999 was also included in the album. This was followed by an interlude titled &quot;Xtina&#x27;s Xmas&quot;. The album ends with &quot;The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix)&quot; which was Aguilera&#x27;s version of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; remade as a dance-styled number by Thunderpuss who set the song to &quot;a kicking dance beat&quot;.

==Promotion==
The album was released on October 24, 2000, by RCA Records as Aguilera&#x27;s third studio album in the United States, following her two first albums &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; (1999) and &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; (2000). It was released as two formats: CD and cassette. In order to promote the album, Aguilera promoted the album on a number of shows, including &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot;, and &quot;David Letterman Show&quot;. On December 10, 2000, Aguilera performed &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; during a concert at Franklin High in Milwaukee, being watched by 1,300 students. She also performed during an ABC special concert later in December; the set list included songs from her three first studio albums, including a song from &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot;, &quot;Have Yourself A Little Merry Christmas&quot;. There, she performed the track with Brian McKnight. The concert was filmed and released as a DVD entitled &quot;My Reflection&quot; (2001).

===Singles===
&quot;The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)&quot; was the only song released as a single from the album. It was sent to Hot adult contemporary and adult contemporary radio stations on November 15, 1999, as well as receiving a commercial release on a compact disc. It was released alongside the &quot;Thunderpuss 2000 Holiday Remix&quot; and the Eddie Arroyo Rhythm Mix of &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;. &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; became Aguilera&#x27;s fifth top-twenty hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 18 on the chart. Aguilera&#x27;s version became the second highest position for the song in the chart after the original.

&quot;Christmas Time&quot; was released in December 2000 on a compact disc as a single. RCA released the song in the United States and BMG distributed it throughout Europe. A promotional live video was released as well.

On November 10, 2023, &quot;This Christmas&quot; was released as a promotional single in Japan, through Sony Music Solutions. The song was later certified gold by IFPI Danmark for selling over 45,000 units.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

The album garnered mixed reviews from music critics who criticized the production and Aguilera&#x27;s vocal delivery. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that &quot;none of the new songs are knockouts&quot; but the album was an &quot;entertaining seasonal dance-pop&quot; that &quot;may not add too much to Christina&#x27;s catalog&quot; but &quot;suggest that she may not be a mere one-album wonder.&quot; Chris Willman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that &quot;Aguilera oversings so wildly that there wouldn&#x27;t have been enough oxygen in the booth to sustain another life form&quot;, and that Aguilera &quot;is out of control here, spoiling some nifty modern arrangements with her exhausting insistence on making every other syllable an octave spanning tour de force.&quot; Jaan Uhelszki from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the album as being &quot;chilly, forced and overdone&quot;, and claimed that the album &quot;is just another forum to showcase Aguilera&#x27;s formidable bag of vocal gymnastics and posturing without a shred of sincerity or warmth&quot;. &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; was not impressed toward Aguilera&#x27;s vocal ability on the album, giving it a mixed review. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; writer Christopher Gray gave the album two stars noting that &quot;Aguilera certainly has the pipes to outlast such jejune nonsense, but she&#x27;s got to learn some subtlety first, and Christmas songs aren&#x27;t exactly the best material to be practicing on&quot;.

===Retrospective reception===
In an ex post facto review, &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Taylor Weatherby noted in 2016 that &quot;for some reason, Aguilera&#x27;s album is not really one that gets circulated annually when local radio stations go into full-on Christmas mode, even despite reaching number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Holiday Albums chart&quot;. However, some musicians, including Fifth Harmony, have gone on the record praising &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot;. In his 2018 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview Ty Dolla Sign named it &quot;one of the greatest albums ever made&quot;. Emily Marcus of &quot;Us Weekly&quot; ranked it among the top ten best Christmas albums ever and called it an &quot;unforgettable holiday album&quot; that &quot;will always remain an all-time favorite&quot;. &quot;PopCrush&quot; writer Alexandra Capotorto noted that &quot;thanks to [Aguilera&#x27;s] beautiful pipes, we still believe it&#x27;s one of the best Christmas albums to impact within the pop genre&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Forbes&quot; named a promotional single &quot;Christmas Time&quot; as one of the fifteen most iconic Christmas pop songs, noting that &quot;when she [Aguilera] dropped the Christmas record, it garnered mixed reviews, but as time has passed, this track reigns with its mere pop brilliance.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot; debuted at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of about 25,000. It reached its peak at number 28. It also peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Holiday Albums chart. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum for having sold more than 1,015,000 copies in the country.

<doc id="1223475" wikidata="Q2713943" url="?curid=1223475" title="Morrigan Aensland">
<text>is a character and protagonist in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; series. Having debuted in 1994&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, she has since appeared in every game in the series and in various related media and merchandise, as well as in multiple video games outside the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; line, including most entries in both &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; and &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot;. 

Morrigan is a succubus and a powerful princess (later queen) of the demon realm Makai, who is very vain and lives for little more than the excitement of battle, but slowly begins to take her royal responsibilities more seriously despite her obsessive fascination with the human world. She has a sister-like split part named Lilith and a rival named Demitri Maximoff, and her moveset is reminiscent of Ryu.

==Concept and creation==

Early in the development of &quot;&quot;, Capcom had decided to include two female characters: a cute female vampire and a catgirl with massive breasts, the latter of which was originally intended to be the game&#x27;s &quot;sex appeal&quot;. According to story planner Haruo Murata, the former was planned to be the female figurehead of the game, similar to Chun-Li for &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda oversaw the development process, and expected a character similar to the comic book character Vampirella. During the design process, Capcom producer Alex Jimenez suggested they instead make her a succubus, as the game already had a male vampire planned. As a result the characters&#x27; roles shifted, with the catgirl Felicia becoming a cute character to offset the game&#x27;s darker tones, while the succubus Morrigan became the game&#x27;s sex symbol.

Her finalized appearance came from Hiroshi Shibata, a member of the game&#x27;s Objects team. Morrigan is a woman with long green hair and bangs, and wears a black leotard that cups her breasts with a heart-shaped cutout beneath her cleavage. The upper straps of the leotard are lowered around her shoulders, with a white feather trip extending around her shoulders and cleavage. Her legs are covered by tan tights with a bat pattern on them, while matching sleeves extend from the leotard straps to her middle finger, and black high heel boots cover her feet. Two large bat wings extend from her lower back, while a secondary smaller set extends from the sides of her head. In an early version of her design a white skull decal was intended to cover the crotch of the leotard, but was later removed. She stands 172 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall, and has measurements of 86–56–83 cm (34-22-33 in). Throughout her appearances, Morrigan has had several alternative outfits including a white unbuttoned white shirt and black pants, a fetish wear nurse&#x27;s outfit, a Chinese cheongsam, and Japanese formal dresses.

Her initial standing sprite and several basic poses were designed by Yasuda, while the remainder of the animations were developed by Hiromi &quot;Mori&quot; Kotobuki. According to Yasuda, Kotobuki was so impressed by her standing pose he paid a lot of attention to detail when animating the character, particularly giving her fingers movement during it. For her attacks and several of her movements, her wings were made to be a collection of shapeshifting bats that could form blades, drills and other items such as jetpacks to give her increased range and mobility. Her facial expressions when hit meanwhile were made more comical and less refined, something the development team felt suited the atmosphere of the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; games. Meanwhile, her character portrays were designed by freelance illustrator Bengus, who added bags under her eyes to give her a more &quot;Gothic&quot; aesthetic. Though the development team was hesitant regarding this detail, Yasuda heavily praised it as exactly what he had been looking for with her design.

The name Morrigan was also suggested by Jimenez, who felt it would fit nobility. Elements such as her rivalry with fellow character Demitri Maximoff were conceived when &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine asked for additional details about the characters and their backstory after the release of the first game. Meanwhile, her home location was placed in Scotland to tie into the ancestry behind her character&#x27;s name. According to Murata, he felt Morrigan did a great job &quot;playing out the seductive succubus role&quot;, while Yasuda expressed he was pleased with the results as it provided Capcom with a character they could use again and again in other titles.

Morrigan&#x27;s character has been voiced in most games by Yayoi Jinguji until 2011, when the role was taken over by Rie Tanaka. Morrigan&#x27;s English voice was provided by Erin Fitzgerald for &quot;Cross Edge&quot; and by Siobhan Flynn for the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
Introduced in the 1994 fighting game &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, Morrigan is the adopted succubus daughter of the demon realm&#x27;s ruler. Though she is heir to that throne, she has little interest in it and instead routinely travels to the human realm for stimulation and excitement, and has a rivalry with the vampire Demitri Maximoff. The follow-up title &quot;Vampire Savior&quot; introduces Lilith, a fragment of Morrigan&#x27;s soul that was previously sealed away but now given its own body and identity by the demon lord Jedah. Acting as Morrigan&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot;, the two would re-merge by the game&#x27;s conclusion. Since her first appearance, Morrigan has appeared in other fighting games such as &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix / Pocket Fighter&quot;, as well as several Capcom-produced crossover titles. These include &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot; and its sequels (with Lilith as an alternate palette swap version in the first game), &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes&quot; and its sequel, as well as &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot; and its related sequels.

In non-fighting games she appears in the crossover tactical role-playing game &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot; as well as related titles &quot;Cross Edge&quot; and &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;, and in puzzle games &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Puzzle Spirits&quot;, and &quot;Puzzle Fighter&quot;, 
and in several card games including &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter × All Capcom&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Battle Combination&quot;, and &quot;Onimusha Soul&quot;. Other game appearances include the Sega Dreamcast port of Psikyo&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Gunbird 2&quot;, &quot;We Love Golf!&quot;, and &quot;Monster Hunter Frontier&quot;.

Furthermore, she has her own mobile game, titled &quot;&quot;, Her collaboration guest appearances in mobile social games have included &quot;Samurai Kingdom&quot; and &quot;The Knights of Avalon&quot; among others, and her costume can be worn by Chun-Li in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; and by Frank West in action-adventure game &quot;Dead Rising 4&quot;.

===Other appearances===
====Other media====
The 1997 anime OVA series &quot;Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge&quot; features Morrigan like her game appearances, portraying her as an idle rich member of a royal family who is more interested in going to Earth than in her duties. She often leaves at will out of mere boredom, much to the frustration of her guardians, elder men of the Aensland family. Her father, Belial, is not mentioned. Princess Morrigan is shown fighting the werewolf Jon Talbain in the opening of the first three episodes. She seeks to battle the vampire lord Demitri Maximoff when he attempts to return to Makai, but their duel with erotic undertones is interrupted when they are sensed by Huitzil. In the final episode, Morrigan goes to Earth after Demitri was bested by Pyron and she encounters him unconscious in the ruins of his castle. Demitri suddenly awakens and attempts to vampirise Morrigan, but she does not resist, much to his surprise. Morrigan tells Demitri that he may become the leader of Makai after all, since a change of leadership is needed to help its current disarray from falling into destruction. They both later observe Donovan&#x27;s victory over Pyron. The anime&#x27;s Morrigan was voiced by Rei Sakuma and dubbed into English by Kathleen Barr.

In the UDON Comics series &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, Morrigan is portrayed as a malevolent, evil and amoral succubus like the games, who wants nothing more than to visit the human world to eat human souls and dreams, and completely ignores her duty as future ruler of the Makai Realm. Morrigan&#x27;s attitude annoys her father Belial and gets her two servants, Lucien and Mudo, into trouble. Eventually she hears of Demitri&#x27;s restoration, and goes to her father to warn him, only to find that he is about to die. She takes on the responsibility that she has often put aside and returns to the human world to fight Demitri, and prove herself worthy of the Makai Realm and the power that Belial sealed away many years ago. In the special issue &quot;Morrigan vs Demitri&quot;, it is implied that had Belial not sealed away her power, Morrigan might have evolved into a being similar to Pyron and destroyed the Earth and Makai. In the comics, Morrigan&#x27;s bats are the souls of her human victims, which are not destroyed but remain alive inside her body in a state of eternal bliss and pleasure after she drains them. Aside from consuming souls, Morrigan has no qualms about murdering and taking advantage on humans yet despite this, she sees herself as simply taking people&#x27;s souls in exchange for eternal bliss.&quot; She is also prominently featured in the followup series &quot;Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors&quot;, in which she, Demitri, Donovan, and Pyron all fight each other. In the later crossover series &quot;Street Fighter vs Darkstalkers&quot;, Morrigan keeps killing humans until she meets Lilith and finds out about Jedah&#x27;s plan. Together with her enemy Chun-Li, as well as other uneasy allies, Morrigan and Lilith fight and defeat Jedah, and then they merge, finally restoring Morrigan to her full power. Despite everything she&#x27;s done, Morrigan gets away with her crimes and is crowned queen of Makai.

Morrigan also appears in the comedic &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; drama CDs &quot;Vampire Knight&quot; (ヴァンパイア・ナイト), &quot;Darkness Mission&quot; (ダークネスミッション) and &quot;Dengeki CD Bunko EX: Vampire&quot; (電撃CD文庫EX ヴァンパイア), voiced by Rei Sakuma, Kikuko Inoue and Yumi Tōma, as well as in multiple yonkoma parody comics for that were largely compiled from fan submissions. She is often a lead character in various adaptations of &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, such as the 1995 manga anthology &quot;Dark Angel&quot; (闇天使) and Akihiko Ureshino&#x27;s series of gaiden novels, in particular in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Witch of the Crimson Moon&quot; (紅い月の魔女) and 1996&#x27;s &quot;Where the Souls Go&quot; (魂の還るところ). Morrigan stars in Run Ishida&#x27;s 1996 manga which was published in English by Viz Comics in two different versions in 1998 and 2000 as &quot;Night Warriors: Darkstalkers&#x27; Revenge&quot;, spending the entire second half of the 2000 tradeback edition fighting Donovan, as well as in Mami Itou&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Darkstalkers/Red Earth: Maleficarum&quot;, a &quot;Red Earth&quot; crossover manga published in English by UDON Comics in 2010 and was re-released in Japan in 2015. Hiroaki Wakamiya&#x27;s 1996 manga &quot;Victor: Messenger of Doomsday&quot; (終末の使者 ビクトル) has Morrigan use her secret identity human persona of the biotechnology researcher Professor Mori to study the human world.

In the U.S. made non-canon cartoon series &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, Morrigan was redesigned as character and changed into a villain, voiced by Saffron Henderson. Morrigan&#x27;s character in the cartoon is jealous, rude, power-hungry and despising humans, especially men. She is implied to actually eat her victims and stated to be a direct descendant of the evil sorceress Morgan le Fay (with the series&#x27; protagonist, an original character named Harry Grimoire, being a descendant of Merlin). Her appearance was also altered, making her look slightly older and wear a less revealing costume; GamesRadar commented USA &quot;gave her a look more appropriate for the Wicked Witch of the West than a sexy, soul-sucking, battle-loving demon.&quot;

==Promotion and reception==

Scores of various figures and statuettes of Morrigan were produced by different manufacturers. These include the figures released by Capcom themselves, Diamond Select Toys, E246, Marvel, Max Factory, Pop Culture Shock Collectibles, and SOTA Toys among many others. Other Morrigan-themed merchandise include Capcom&#x27;s wall scrolls and posters, T-shirts, covers, a large microfiber towel, and so forth.

In 1996, &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; described her as &quot;one of the most bewitching girl characters ever to appear in gaming&quot;, noting her large Japanese fanbase which included men and women. Morrigan is widely seen as the most iconic character of &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, arguably even more than the franchise itself, and one of the most popular female characters of video games in general. Anthony Gramuglia of &quot;CBR&quot; noted that Morrigan&#x27;s popularity not only stemmed from her character, but also the character&#x27;s popularity in cosplay and fan-art communities. Helen McCarthy&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies: The Ultimate Guide&quot; additionally cited Morrigan as an example of the popularity of the &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; character designs, with fans frequently cosplaying as the character at various conventions since the original game&#x27;s release.

Since her debut, Morrigan has been a popular character, resulting in the creation of large amounts of fan works, such as statuetes, cosplays and fan art. Morrigan has featured in many doujinshi unofficial self-published content, including erotic comics and pornographic films. Manga artist Hiroaki Samura, creator of the manga &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot;, released his own doujin of the character titled &quot;Night of the Succubus&quot;. Korean video game artist and Shift Up founder Kim Hyung Tae meanwhile stated her design led him to &quot;see the unique allure of women wearing tights&quot;, something that heavily impacted his character designs afterward.

M. Mar Martínez-Oña and Ana M. Muñoz-Muñoz cited Morrigan as an example of iconography of Lilith, who has been traditionally depicted as a &quot;as a highly eroticized devil, usually figured with horns and wings&quot;. They further cited a statement by Dr. Vicent Francesc Zuriaga Senent, who argued modern depictions of devils often showed them as not something to be feared, but to be desired.

<text>Central Station () is a 1998 road drama film directed by Walter Salles from a screenplay by João Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein, based on an original idea by Salles. It stars Fernanda Montenegro, Marília Pêra and Vinícius de Oliveira. The film tells the story of a young boy&#x27;s friendship with a jaded middle-aged woman. 

&quot;Central Station&quot; premiered in Switzerland on 16 January 1998, in Brazil on 3 April, and on France on 2 December. The film received critical acclaim, with Montenegro&#x27;s performance earning her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (becoming the first Brazilian actress to ever be nominated in the lead actress category on both awards), while the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and the Golden Bear of the Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2015, the Brazilian Film Critics Association aka Abraccine voted &quot;Central Station&quot; the 11th greatest Brazilian film of all time, in its list of the 100 best Brazilian films.

==Plot==

Dora is a retired schoolteacher who works at Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Central Station, writing letters for illiterate customers to earn a living. Embittered by life, she usually shows a lack of patience with customers and sometimes does not mail the letters she writes, putting them in a drawer or even tearing them up instead. One of her customers is the mother of Josué, a poor 9-year-old boy who hopes to meet his unknown father someday. When she is killed in a bus accident just outside the train station, and Josué is left homeless, Dora feels compelled to take him in. She trafficks him to a corrupt couple but later steals him back out of guilt.

Initially reluctant to be responsible for the boy, Dora eventually decides to accompany him on a trip to northeastern Brazil in search of his father.

Dora tries to leave Josué on the bus, but he follows her, forgetting his backpack containing Dora&#x27;s money. Penniless, they are picked up by a kind, evangelical truck driver who abandons them when Dora encourages him to drink beer and then grows too friendly. Dora trades her watch for a ride to &quot;Bom Jesus do Norte&quot; (a fictionalized version of Cruzeiro do Nordeste, a district of Sertânia, Pernambuco). They find Josué&#x27;s father&#x27;s address in Bom Jesus, but he is gone; the current residents say he won a house in a lottery and moved to the new settlements. With no money, Josué saves them from destitution by suggesting Dora write letters for visitors arriving in Bom Jesus for a massive pilgrimage.

They take the bus to the settlements, but when they locate the address they have for Josué&#x27;s father, the residents tell them he no longer lives there; they say he has disappeared. Josué tells Dora that he will wait for him, but Dora invites him to live with her. She calls her friend Irene in Rio and asks her to sell her refrigerator, sofa, and television. She says that she will call when she gets settled somewhere. After she hangs up, she learns there are no buses leaving until the next morning.

Isaías, one of Josué&#x27;s half-brothers, is working on a roof next to the bus stop and learns that they are looking for his father, insisting Dora and Josué come to dinner. They return to his house and meet Moisés, Josué&#x27;s other half-brother. Later, Isaías explains to Dora that their father Jesus married Ana (who he doesn&#x27;t know is Josué&#x27;s mother) after their mother died, and that nine years ago, while pregnant, Ana left him to live in Rio and never returned. Isaías asks Dora to read a letter that his father wrote to Ana when he disappeared, six months ago, in case she returned. In the letter, the boys&#x27; father explains that he has gone to Rio to find Ana and the son he never met. He promises to return, asks her to wait for him, and says they can all be together—himself, Ana, Isaías, and Moisés. Dora pauses, looks at Josué, and says, &quot;and Josué, whom I can&#x27;t wait to meet.&quot; Isaías and Josué are sure their father will return, but Moisés does not believe it.

The next morning, while they sleep, Dora sneaks out to catch the bus to Rio. She first leaves behind the letter from Jesus and the one from Ana - the one Dora carried with her from the Central Station but never mailed, expressing Ana&#x27;s wish for the family to be reunited. Josué wakes up too late to prevent her departure. Dora writes a letter to Josué on the bus. Both are left with the photos they had taken to remember one another.

== Production ==
Being a co-production between Brazil and France, the film was chosen by the French Ministry of Culture to receive resources of Fonds Sud Cinema, for their funding.

== Release ==
&quot;Central Station&quot; had its world premiere at a regional film festival in Switzerland on 16 January 1998. It was then screened at the Sundance Film Festival on 19 January 1998 and at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival on 14 February 1998. Shortly after its Sundance premiere, Miramax Films acquired distribution rights to the film in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Central and South America (except Brazil), Africa, Eastern Europe, Greece and the Middle East for $1.2 million. Miramax reportedly bid higher for a worldwide rights deal; this deal would not go through, making way for Sony Pictures Classics to acquire U.S. distribution rights for $500,000 prior to the Sundance premiere.
The film was released in Brazil on 3 April 1998 in 36 theaters.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed R$7.7 million (US$4.3 million) from 1.6 million admissions in Brazil, the highest-grossing Brazilian film released during the year.

It was the highest-grossing Brazilian film in the United States with a gross of $6.5 million, surpassing the $3 million earned by the 1976 film &quot;Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands&quot;. It was surpassed by the 2002 film &quot;City of God&quot; which grossed $7.5 million.
It grossed US$11.7 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of US$22,462,500.

===Critical response===
The film received critical acclaim. &quot;Central Station&quot; has an approval rating of 94% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 50 reviews, and an average rating of 7.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Director Salles transcends road-movie clichés and crafts a film that is as moving as it is universal&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews.

The film was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Critics&#x27; Pick: according to Janet Maslin, &quot;Mr. Salles directs simply and watchfully, with an eye that seems to penetrate all the characters&quot;; the film features a &quot;bravura performance by the Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro.&quot; According to Richard Schickel, the film is &quot;an odyssey of simple problems, simple emotional discoveries, [and] a relationship full of knots that Salles permits to unwind in an unforced, unsentimental fashion. His imagery, like his storytelling, is clear, often unaffectedly lovely, and quietly, powerfully haunting. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade of A–, concluding &quot;In outline, &quot;Central Station&quot; recalls many of the bogusly sticky adult–kid bonding tales that have been the bane of foreign cinema for too long, but Salles, like De Sica and Renoir, displays a pure and unpatronizing feel for the poetry of broken lives. His movie is really about that most everyday of miracles: the rebirth of hope.&quot;
The film is ranked No. 57 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

<text>Ashley Jovon Lelie (; born February 16, 1980) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Hawaii Warriors and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft with the 19th overall pick.

Lelie also played for the Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers, Oakland Raiders and was briefly signed by the Kansas City Chiefs, but was released before the 2009 season began.

==Early life==
Lelie attended Radford High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, and was a three-sport standout in football, track, and basketball. In football, he won All-District and All-State honors. In basketball, he won All-District honors and in track, he won an All-League honors.

In 2006, Lelie donated a scoreboard to his alma mater. Ashley is the son of retired United States Marine Rene Allday Lelie and Annetta Lelie a nurse.

==College career==
Lelie was a standout wide receiver at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa from 1999 to 2001. He places prominently on Rainbow Warriors&#x27; career receiving lists:
* 8th in career receptions (194)
* 5th in career receiving yards (3,341)
* 4th in career receiving touchdowns (32)

==Professional career==
Lelie was selected by the Denver Broncos with their first pick (19th overall) in the 2002 NFL Draft. He became a starter in 2004 when he recorded his best year with 54 receptions for 1,084 yards.

Lelie became unhappy in Denver at the start of the 2006 season when Denver traded for Javon Walker during the 2006 NFL draft. He skipped training camp and asked to be traded, which led to tension with head coach Mike Shanahan.

Lelie was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in a three-way deal with the Washington Redskins in August 2006, and went on to play as a backup for the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders in subsequent seasons.

==NFL career statistics==

=== Playoffs ===
==Coaching career==
In 2014 Lelie was hired by the Alabama A&amp;M Bulldogs football team to be their wide receivers coach.

During the 2013 football season Lelie served as the offensive quality control coach for the Nevada Wolf Pack football team under new head coach Brian Polian. Lelie joined former Hawaii teammate and offensive coordinator Nick Rolovich.

<doc id="1223481" wikidata="Q1512935" url="?curid=1223481" title="False Dmitry">
<text>The generic name False Dmitry (also Pseudo-Demetrius, , &quot;Lžedmitrij&quot;) refers to various impostors who passed themselves off as the deceased Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible, and claimed the Russian throne during the Time of Troubles (1598–1613), after the real Dmitry&#x27;s death at the age of eight in 1591. Each of these impostors claimed to have miraculously escaped the assassination attempt that appeared to have claimed Dmitry&#x27;s life, and, in the case of II and III, also to have escaped the assassinations that subsequently targeted I and II.

Several people impersonated Dmitry Ivanovich, most prominently:

* False Dmitry I (1582–1606), who actually became Tsar of all Russia and reigned 1605–1606
* False Dmitry II, active 1607–1610
* False Dmitry III, active 1611–1612 
* , active 1611–1612 (some argue that False Dmitry IV is just False Dmitry III due to bad record keeping)

<text>This article lists political parties in Anguilla.

Anguilla used to be a part of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, which hindered the formation of parties on the island. Early parties included the Anguilla Democratic Party (founded by October 1967 during the island&#x27;s brief and unrecognized independence as the Republic of Anguilla) and the Anguilla Constructive Democratic Movement (founded after The Anguilla (Administration) Order of 1971). Both organizations quickly vanished as they lacked mass appeal. The Anguilla (Constitution) Order of 1976 firmly laid &quot;the foundations for the development of party politics&quot;.

The first party to formally take part in elections was the People&#x27;s Progressive Party led by Ronald Webster, which won 6 out of 7 seats at the 1976 Anguillian general election. Parties that appeared during the 1972–1980 period include the Anguilla Democratic Party (led by Camile Connor as of 1976), the Anguilla National Alliance, and the Anguilla United Movement (founded by Webster). The latter two broke off from the PPP, which ceased to exist, and contested the 1980 Anguillian general election.

The Anguilla United Front alliance, consisting of the Anguilla Democratic Party and the Anguilla National Alliance, was formed in 2000. The Anguilla United Movement became the Anguilla Progressive Movement in 2019.

Due to holding elections under forms of first-past-the-post, Anguilla has a two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties, with it being extremely difficult for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party.

<doc id="1223488" wikidata="Q7040614" url="?curid=1223488" title="Nishimachi International School">
<text>Nishimachi International School (西町インターナショナルスクール), established in 1949, is an international school located in the Azabu area of Tokyo, Japan. Co-educational, non-sectarian, private K-9 day school. The main language of instruction is in English. Japanese is taught to all students every day from beginner to native speaker level.

==History==
Nishimachi International School was founded by Tané Matsukata, granddaughter of former prime minister of Japan Matsukata Masayoshi, and sister of Haru M. Reischauer, wife of former United States ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer.

Tané Matsukata returned to Japan after seventeen years in the U.S., where she received her education and spent the war years. She found Tokyo still badly scarred from the war although the slow process of rebuilding had begun. In discussion with friends, she began to realize the important role that education would play in the reconstruction process. Together they explored the alternatives and concluded that a new approach other than traditional education was needed, one that stressed the human side of learning and had peaceful coexistence with others as an objective. Learning a second language, in this case English, was step one in the educational process. They saw this as fundamental to extending the children&#x27;s understanding beyond the boundaries of their own culture and into other cultures. They hired a teacher for Japanese, and the school that was eventually to become Nishimachi opened its doors to its first four students. Matsukata is related by marriage to the late Harvard professor, Edwin O. Reischauer.

==Details==
The Nishimachi school year, for grades 1-9, begins on August 21, and finishes on June 12. Middle school students enjoy dances, a week-long ski trip, Kazuno, and many other holidays and traditions. Nishimachi owns a piece of land in Kazuno, Gunma Prefecture about 3 hours travel away from the city. The land belonged to Ryoichiro Arai, Tané Matsukata&#x27;s maternal grandfather who was a silk producer. In 1945, the women and children of the Matsukata family moved to this farmhouse to seek refuge from the US bombings of Tokyo. Today, the property has been converted to a camp that includes a main house, a traditional Japanese farmhouse that has been converted for additional sleeping accommodations, and a renovated traditional Japanese storage house (okura)that was used by Ryoichiro Arai. The main house has two rooms and bunk beds on the first floor, and a kitchen and dining room on the second floor. The farmhouse has four rooms of tatami with wooden screens that can be pulled away to open up the room.

==Accreditation==
Nishimachi International School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Council of International Schools (CIS), and is a member of the Japan Council of International Schools (JCIS) and the East Asia Regional Council of Overseas School (EARCOS).

==Facilities==
The campus is located in central Tokyo and comprises six buildings: the Matsukata House, the Ushiba Memorial Gymnasium/auditorium, the kindergarten building in the nearby Moto Azabu Hills complex, the primary building, the upper elementary/middle school building, and the Yashiro Media Center. Matsukata House was the original family residence of Nishimachi&#x27;s founder, Tané Matsukata, and now serves as the school&#x27;s main administrative building. The Yashiro Media Center, housed in its own three-floor building, contains about 18,000 books, 70% in English and 30% in Japanese, and uses the Dewey Decimal System. Nishimachi&#x27;s outdoor education center, Camp Rioichiro Arai &quot;Kazuno,&quot; is in Gunma Prefecture, 150 kilometers northwest of Tokyo.

===Matsukata House===
The core of the facilities is the Matsukata House, built in 1921 as a three-story wooden colonial style house with a basement. Shokuma and Miyo Matsukata, the parents of Tané Matsukata, commissioned the American architect William M. Vories (1880–1964) to design the house. Takenaka Komuten (the Takenaka Corporation) built the house. Seismic tests in 2008 revealed flaws that resulted in the closure of the house until it could be reinforced in 2009.

<text>Charles Knowlton (May 10, 1800 – February 20, 1850) was an American physician and writer.

==Education==
Knowlton was born May 10, 1800, in Templeton, Massachusetts. His parents were Stephen and Comfort (White) Knowlton; his grandfather Ezekiel Knowlton was a captain in the revolution and a long-time state legislator. Knowlton attended local schools, then New Salem Academy. At age 18, he taught school briefly in Alstead, New Hampshire. As a young man, Knowlton was extremely concerned about his health. This led him to spend time with Richard Stuart, a “jack of all trades” in Winchendon who was experimenting with electricity. Knowlton married Stuart&#x27;s daughter, Tabitha, and his condition was instantly cured.

Knowlton studied medicine with several area doctors, and attended two terms of 14-week “medical lectures” at Dartmouth. He supplemented his education by digging up and dissecting corpses. Knowlton was awarded his M.D. in 1824, moved to Hawley, Massachusetts, to begin his practice, and then served two months in the Worcester County jail for illegal dissection.

==&quot;Modern Materialism&quot;==
While in jail, Knowlton formulated ideas that he eventually published as &quot;Elements of Modern Materialism&quot; in 1829. The book challenges the religious dualism of body and spirit, and Knowlton presents a psychological theory that has been described as “early behaviorism.” Knowlton moved his family to North Adams, Massachusetts, in 1827, to be closer to a printer. In the summer of 1829, he took “one-horse load” of books down to New York city. He failed to sell any, but probably visited local freethinkers like Robert Dale Owen. Knowlton named his second son Stephen Owen, after his father and his friend. Knowlton was convinced &quot;Modern Materialism&quot; would make him as famous as John Locke, whom he quotes on the title page.

==&quot;The Fruits of Philosophy&quot;==
In 1832, Knowlton moved his family and medical practice to Ashfield, Massachusetts. A year later, the town&#x27;s new minister, Mason Grosvenor, began a campaign against &quot;infidelity and licentiousness,&quot; targeting Knowlton as its source. Knowlton had written a little book entitled, &quot;The Fruits of Philosophy, or the Private Companion of Young Married People&quot;, and had been showing it to his patients. It contained a summary of what was then known about the physiology of conception, listed a number of methods to treat infertility and impotence, and explained a method of birth control he had developed: to wash out the vagina after intercourse with certain chemical solutions.

Knowlton was prosecuted and fined in Taunton, Massachusetts for the book. Abner Kneeland printed a second edition of &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot; in Boston in 1832, allowing it a wider circulation than the few closely guarded copies Knowlton had been lending to patients. This led to Knowlton&#x27;s imprisonment in Cambridge at “hard labor” for three months, and was a central issue in Kneeland&#x27;s blasphemy trial in 1838. Reverend Grosvenor filed a complaint against Knowlton in Franklin County, but after two juries failed to convict him, the charges were dropped. Grosvenor left Ashfield, and became a general agent for the Aetna insurance company.

==Later life==
Knowlton became the leading country doctor in western Massachusetts, with a “ride” that covered thirty towns. He contributed several articles to the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, as well as Kneeland&#x27;s freethought paper, the &quot;Boston Investigator&quot;. Knowlton was an officer of several freethinking societies in New England and New York, and founded “The Friends of Mental Liberty” in Greenfield in 1845. In addition to affirming its members&#x27; right of &quot;freely enquiring into the truth of all religions which claim to be a Revelation from some intelligent being superior to man,&quot; the group&#x27;s Constitution declared that &quot;Female members of this Society shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as male members.&quot;

Knowlton died on February 20, 1850. Twenty-seven years later, Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant were tried in London for publishing Knowlton&#x27;s &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot; there. The book had been selling in moderate numbers in the interim, but the publicity from the Bradlaugh-Besant trial made it an overnight bestseller. Its circulation increased from an average of 700 per year to 125,000 in just one year. Besant subsequently published her own birth control manual.

<text>Reuben Droughns (; born August 21, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for the Oregon Ducks, he was selected by the Detroit Lions in the third round of the 2000 NFL draft. During his nine years playing professional football, Droughns was also a member of the Miami Dolphins, Denver Broncos, Cleveland Browns, and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He earned a Super Bowl ring with the Giants in their Super Bowl XLII victory against the New England Patriots.

Following his playing career, Droughns worked as an assistant coach for the Serbian team Vukovi Beograd, the two-time champions of the Central European Football League (CEFL) from 2010 to 2013.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Droughns moved from the Midwest to Orange County, California where he attended Anaheim High School (Anaheim, California) and was a student and a letterman in football and wrestling. In football, he rushed for 49 touchdowns and 4,915 yards, which ranked as the second-most yards gained in Orange County high school football history when he ended his prep career. He was voted All-Orange County and All-CIF twice and All-Orange League three times, including Back of the Year honors as a senior. Droughns was also an accomplished wrestler, winning the CIF-Southern Section title in 1996 (Division I - 189 pounds) during his senior year.

==College career==
Droughns played college football at the University of Oregon in 1998 and 1999 and was a two-year starter. In his first game for the Ducks, he ran for 202 yards and two scores in a 48–14 rout of Michigan State. Although he missed one game and most of another due to an ankle injury, he would run for 214 yards and three touchdowns in a 63–28 blowout win over Stanford and then 217 yards and three scores on the road against Washington State. One of his most impressive performances came at UCLA, where he ran for 172 yards and a score despite fracturing his right fibula late in the contest (a 41–38 overtime loss), an injury that would force him to miss the rest of the season. Despite the injury, Droughns was still named second team All-Pac-10 for his junior season. Droughns had 1,234 yards and nine touchdowns on 277 carries (4.5) as a senior, including rushing for over 200 yards in three contests, and was a first-team All-Pac-10 choice as a senior. Droughns was a history major at Oregon.

At Merced Junior College, he was a first team JUCO All-America selection as a sophomore after leading the nation in yards in 1997 with 1,611 while also scoring 13 touchdowns and leading the state of California in all-purpose yardage with 1,984 despite missing three games with a broken hand. Prep Star Magazine deemed him the nation&#x27;s top JUCO running back after that campaign. Droughns was also an honorable mention All-American as a freshman, when he led the Blue Devils in rushing with 1,456 yards and 14 TDs.

==Professional career==

===Detroit Lions===

====2000 season====

Droughns was selected by the Detroit Lions in the third round (81st pick overall) of the 2000 NFL draft. Droughns spent the 2000 season on injured reserve after separating his right shoulder on his first carry in Detroit&#x27;s opening preseason game against the New England on August 4, then placed on injured reserve August 22.

====2001 season====
During the 2001 season, he played in nine games and started three for the Lions, rushing for 72 yards on 30 carries (2.4) and catching four passes for 21 yards (5.3) and a touchdown. He was waived by Detroit after Week 1 and was signed to Miami&#x27;s practice squad on September 18 before being re-signed by the Lions on October 9.

===Denver Broncos===

====2002-2004 seasons====

Droughns played for the Denver Broncos for three seasons from 2002 to 2004. Although originally intended to be a fullback, he became the Broncos&#x27; starting running back in 2004. Starting 15 out of 16 games, Droughns ultimately rushed for 1,240 yards and six touchdowns. He also tied a playoff franchise record by returning six kickoffs in the wildcard loss to Indianapolis, January 4, 2004. Despite this production, Droughns was not guaranteed the starting job for the 2005 season, so he asked for a trade.

===Cleveland Browns===

====2005-2006 seasons====
Droughns was traded to the Cleveland Browns on March 30, 2005, for defensive linemen Ebenezer Ekuban and Michael Myers. In 2005 he ran for 1,232 yards and two touchdowns, becoming the first Browns player to gain 1,000 yards rushing in a season since Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack both achieved the feat in 1985. The following season, Droughns rushed for 758 yards and four touchdowns.

===New York Giants===

====2007-2008 seasons====
On March 9, 2007, Droughns was traded to the New York Giants in exchange for wide receiver Tim Carter. Playing behind starter Brandon Jacobs, Droughns battled Derrick Ward for the back-up job but became the third running back for the Giants as part of a rotation that replaced the retired Tiki Barber. However, due to his poor performances throughout the year, he dropped to fourth on the Giants depth chart behind rookie Ahmad Bradshaw, and was replaced by Domenik Hixon as kick returner after similar special-teams performances. Though he only started one game during the season, Droughns finished as the Giants third-leading rusher, totaling 275 yards on 85 carries and seven receptions for 49 yards. He was however, primarily used as a goal-line/third down back for most of the regular season, recording a team-leading six rushing touchdowns for the season. In what would turn out to be his final NFL touchdown, Droughns scored on a 2-yard run with 1:37 remaining for the winning points in a 21-16 victory on the road against the Chicago Bears, which proved to be critical in helping the Giants advance to the postseasons. During the playoffs, Droughns played primarily on special teams and participated in all four of New York&#x27;s playoff victories, including the Giants&#x27; 17-14 upset victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, where he was on the field for the game&#x27;s final play. In 2008 preseason, the emergence of D.J. Ware dropped Droughns to fifth on the Giants depth chart at running back, but he managed to make the final 53-man roster playing primarily on special teams in 12 of New York&#x27;s 16 games.

Droughns was released by the Giants on February 9, 2009.

<text>One True Thing is a 1998 American drama film directed by Carl Franklin. It tells the story of a woman in her 20s who is forced to put her life on hold in order to care for her mother, who is dying of cancer. The script was adapted by Karen Croner from the novel by Anna Quindlen, with the story being based on Quindlen&#x27;s own struggle with the death of her mother, Prudence Pantano Quindlen, from ovarian cancer in 1972.

The film stars Meryl Streep, Renée Zellweger, William Hurt, and Tom Everett Scott. Bette Midler sings the lead song, &quot;My One True Friend&quot;, over the end credits. The track was first released on Midler&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Bathhouse Betty&quot;. The film was shot in Morristown, New Jersey and Maplewood, New Jersey, as well as at the campus of Princeton University.

==Plot==
Ellen Gulden has a high-pressure job writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine. Ellen is visiting her family home for her father George&#x27;s surprise birthday party. It becomes obvious that she deeply admires George, a once-celebrated novelist and literature professor at Princeton University, but Ellen has barely restrained disdain for her mother, Kate, and the domestic life she lives.

When it is discovered that Kate has cancer, George pressures Ellen to come home and take care of her mother. Ellen is taken aback by this request, knowing it could jeopardize her career and love interest. However, she eventually agrees, caving into her father&#x27;s appeals and inducements.

As Ellen helps her mother with domestic chores while her father goes about his usual business without helping much, Ellen begins to reassess her views of her parents. She realizes she always brushed her mother aside and idealized her father, despite his self-centered focus on his career and, she discovers, a longtime habit of having flings with his female students.

Ellen attempts to find a place for herself in her parents&#x27; life while struggling to continue writing on a freelance basis and maintain her relationship with her boyfriend in New York. Over time, Ellen grows closer to her mother and learns more about her parents&#x27; marriage—including realizing that Kate has known about George&#x27;s affairs all along. Ellen also learns that her father&#x27;s philandering days have become lonely nights of drinking at a local bar to numb the pain of never again achieving success with, nor even being able to complete, further novels. George admits to Ellen the reason he loved Kate was that she was full of light shining through everything, and he could not bear the thought of her light slipping away.

As her mother is dying, Ellen tells her she loves her, and Kate says she knew it and always had. At the funeral, Ellen ends her relationship with her boyfriend.

After Kate&#x27;s death, the autopsy reveals that Kate actually died of morphine overdose. A district attorney questions Ellen about her mother&#x27;s death. Scenes from this interview are interspersed throughout the movie and raise the suspicion that Ellen assisted her mother&#x27;s suicide. In the closing scene, by Kate&#x27;s grave, Ellen has returned from a new job she found in New York with the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. She is planting daffodils when her father approaches and tells her that she was very brave to do what she did. She looks puzzled until she realizes George thinks she had given her mother the fatal overdose. Ellen replies that she had thought the accomplice was the father. They both realize Kate must have killed herself.

George speaks to Ellen about how much he loved Kate, considering her his muse, his &quot;one true thing.&quot; Ellen explains to her father how to plant the daffodil bulbs and he helps her, foreshadowing their reconciliation based on a mutual and long-overdue appreciation of Kate.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;One True Thing&quot; received mostly favorable reviews from critics, with Streep being the subject of acclaim for bringing warmth and natural energy instead of appearing cold and technical. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 87% based on reviews from 61 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Solid performances lift this drama to a higher level.&quot; The similar site Metacritic grades it 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A to F.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;sensitively written, fluidly directed and expertly acted.&quot; Roger Ebert, reviewing the film for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, commended it for rising above the level of a soap through pure craftsmanship, and awarded the film three stars out of four.

Mick LaSalle in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; declared, &quot;After &quot;One True Thing&quot;, critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she&#x27;s able to give us a woman who&#x27;s at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kenneth Turan noted, &quot;[Streep&#x27;s role] is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career, but Streep adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [her performance] one of her most moving.&quot; Among the few negative reviews, &quot;Salon.com&quot;″s Andrew O&#x27;Hehir complained that the movie &quot;really has no plot&quot;, and found director Carl Franklin unable to properly connect with his cast.

=== Accolades ===
Streep was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film, but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow for her role in &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;.

<doc id="1223499" wikidata="Q1368307" url="?curid=1223499" title="Mateiu Caragiale">
<text>Mateiu Ion Caragiale (; – 17 January 1936), also credited as Matei or Matheiu, or in the antiquated version Mateiŭ, was a Romanian poet and prose writer, best known for his novel &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot;, which portrays the milieu of boyar descendants before and after World War I. Caragiale&#x27;s style, associated with Symbolism, the Decadent movement of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot;, and early modernism, was an original element in the Romanian literature of the interwar period. In other late contributions, Caragiale pioneered detective fiction locally, but there is disagreement over whether his work in the field produced a complete narrative or just fragments. The scarcity of writings he left is contrasted by their critical acclaim and a large, mostly posthumous, following, commonly known as &quot;mateists&quot;.

Also known as an amateur heraldist and graphic artist, the young Caragiale published his works sporadically, seeking instead to impose himself in politics and pursuing a career in the civil service. He was associated with the Conservative-Democratic Party, and then the People&#x27;s League, and ultimately raised controversy by supporting the Central Powers during their occupation of Romania. He afterwards focused on literature, and, during the late 1920s and early 1930s, published most of his prose texts in the magazine &quot;Gândirea&quot;.

The illegitimate and rebellious child of influential playwright Ion Luca Caragiale, he was the half-brother of Luca Caragiale, an avant-garde poet who died in 1921, and the posthumous son-in-law of author Gheorghe Sion. Mateiu Caragiale was loosely affiliated with Romanian Symbolism, a figure noted for his dandyism, eccentricity and Bohemianism, and, for much of his life, a regular presence in the intellectual circle formed around Casa Capșa restaurant. His associates included the controversial political figure Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, cultural animator Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and poet Ion Barbu, who was also one of his most dedicated promoters.

==Biography==

===Early life===
A native of Bucharest, he was born out of wedlock to Ion Luca Caragiale and Maria Constantinescu, an unmarried former Town Hall employee who was 21 at the time. Living his first years at his mother&#x27;s house on Frumoasă Street, near Calea Victoriei (until the building was sold), Mateiu had a half-sister, his mother&#x27;s daughter from another extra-conjugal affair. In 1889, almost a year after separating from his concubine, his father married Alexandrina Burelly, bringing Mateiu into his new family. In following years, he was progressively estranged from his father, and, according to Ecaterina, the youngest of Ion Luca Caragiale and Burelly&#x27;s children, &quot;Mateiu alone confronted [his father] and contradicted him systematically.&quot;

The young Caragiale was sent to school at Anghel Demetriescu&#x27;s Sfântul Gheorghe College in Bucharest, where he discovered a passion for history and heraldry. At around that time, he was probably introduced to Demetriescu&#x27;s circle, which included the doctor Constantin Istrati, the writer Barbu Ștefănescu-Delavrancea, the physicist Ștefan Hepites, the literary critic N. Petrașcu, and the architect Ion Mincu. During a 1901 summer trip to Sinaia, where he sojourned with the Bibescu family, Mateiu was acquainted with George Valentin and Alexandru Bibescu (in a letter he wrote at the time, he described the latter as &quot;only too crazy and a frantic maniac&quot;). His favorite book at age 17 was &quot;L&#x27;Arriviste&quot;, by the French novelist Félicien Champsaur, which, as he himself acknowledged, contributed to his vision of social climbing. In 1903, with Ion Luca, Burelly and their children, he traveled through large portions of Western Europe, visiting Austria-Hungary, Switzerland, Italy and France; during the trip, he recorded the impressions left on him by the various European art trends.

In 1904, his father moved to Berlin, bringing Mateiu with him—in hopes that he could be persuaded to study law at the Frederick William University—, but Mateiu spent his time reading and exploring the Imperial German capital. He would later refer to this period using a French term, &quot;l&#x27;école buissonière&quot; (&quot;the vagrant school&quot;), and stressed that &quot;[it] was of great use to me&quot;. Ecaterina Caragiale indicated that one of her brother&#x27;s favorite pastimes was &quot;admiring the secular trees in the Tiergarten&quot;, and he is also known to have spent entire days at the National Gallery, especially fond of paintings by Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael. Dissatisfied with Mateiu&#x27;s attitude, Ion Luca sent him back to Romania in 1905, where he enrolled at the University of Bucharest Law School, but quit one year later. For a short while, Caragiale-father even entrusted Ștefănescu-Delavrancea with supervising his estranged son.

===Father-son conflict and literary debut===

The conflict with his father was to prolong itself for as long as the latter was alive. Psychiatrist and essayist Ion Vianu, who explored the relationship with the tools of psychoanalysis, describes Mateiu&#x27;s sentiment toward Ion Luca as &quot;antipathy, bordering on hatred&quot;, and proposes that this reflected maternal influences from the brief period when Maria Constantinescu had been left a single parent.

The situation most likely degenerated in 1904, after the death of his aunt Lenci, when Ion Luca took over his son&#x27;s inheritance, and aggravated by his father&#x27;s decision to cease subsidizing him, which left the latter without a stable source of income. He was thus supposed to provide for his mother and sister, until Ion Luca transferred the inheritance resulting from the death of his other aunt Catinca Momuloaia, to his former lover. He also indicated that his father had made him attend the Frederick William University without advancing money for tuition. Some time after returning to Romania, he began attending the Symbolist literary circle formed around the poet and leftist political agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, who provided the young Caragiale with money and often invited him to supper.

In spring 1907, despite the ongoing father-son tensions, Mateiu, who was recovering from a severe form of measles, returned to Berlin, where Ion Luca&#x27;s family was still residing. He soon became the lover of a local woman, an affair which reportedly caused his father to declare himself scandalized. During the same year, Mateiu Caragiale was fascinated with rumors of the Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt violence, recording various exaggerated news about its character and extent, and describing it as &quot;a fine thing&quot;. In 1909, he was again enrolled at University, having decided to prepare for a graduation diploma, but again failed to complete his studies.

Mateiu Caragiale had his first thoughts on &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; in 1910. Two years later, during a trip to Iași, he published his first 13 poems in the literary magazine &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, winning the praise of poet Panait Cerna and the ridicule of writer Tudor Arghezi. Literary critic Șerban Cioculescu stressed that these had been printed following his father&#x27;s interventions with the magazine&#x27;s staff, and, according to the contemporary account of Luca&#x27;s brother-in-law, philosopher Ionel Gherea, Ion Luca admired his son&#x27;s contributions, his criticism being minimal, constructive, and welcomed by Mateiu. This led Gherea to conclude that, copying in real life a Symbolist cliché, Caragiale-son fabricated an unfair image of his father. In later years, Mateiu continued to write poetry, published by literary promoter Constantin Banu in his magazine, &quot;Flacăra&quot;.

His father died in June 1912, which, according to Șerban Cioculescu (who cited Mateiu&#x27;s correspondence), left him indifferent. By then, Caragiale-son resented Ion Luca&#x27;s alleged exploitation of his popularity for material gains, and, later in the same year, commented that, &quot;for a small fee&quot;, Caragiale-father could be persuaded to read his works at the fair in Obor. In a since-lost piece of his diary that was commented upon by Cioculescu, he also claimed that binge drinking and tobacco abuse had made his father decay physically and mentally. Despite his love for Berlin, he was also dissatisfied with his father&#x27;s move to the city, and spread the rumor that, in the eyes of his family and friends, Ion Luca&#x27;s departure was interpreted as &quot;insane&quot; (while alleging that Caragiale-father was planning to author plays in German, with assistance from Mite Kremnitz, the one-time lover of poet Mihai Eminescu). At the funeral ceremony, he reputedly shocked pianist Cella Delavrancea by coldly stating in French: &quot;Je suis venu voir feu mon père&quot; (&quot;I came to see my late father&quot;).

===Entry into the civil service===
Caragiale returned to Bucharest: in summer 1912, with help from journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky, the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette, &quot;L&#x27;Indépendence Roumaine&quot;, informing his readers that he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania. In October, he became the chief of staff in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca&#x27;s political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as a means for his own advancement (&quot;From now on I&#x27;ll have political lode [...], something certain, if there ever was certainty on Earth.&quot;) Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu&#x27;s executive.

As Caragiale senior died, Mateiu initially planned to join the mainstream Conservative Party and demand a post from Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest and a close associate of Bogdan-Pitești. Nevertheless, he came to define this position as &quot;a bad solution&quot;, and, as Maiorescu and Ionescu formed an alliance, he successfully requested appointment from Bădărău, eventually obtaining it through the means of a decree signed by King Carol I. Caragiale later commented: &quot;[Bădărău] entrusted me with this golden key, which I had wanted for so long, and which, for all of this, I had not been desperate to obtain.&quot; This contradicted another one of his accounts, in which he confessed that, initially received with indifference by Bădărău, he had claimed that him joining the Conservative-Democrats had been Ion Luca&#x27;s dying request. Șerban Cioculescu would comment: &quot;There could not have been a more complete distortion of a parent&#x27;s last wish!&quot;

He assumed office on November 7, 1912, but, as he later confessed, official records were modified to make it seem that he had been a civil servant since October 29. His time in office is described by critic Barbu Cioculescu as a bland affair, Mateiu having &quot;ehausted his [political] fantasy&quot; with his efforts to charm Bădărău. As Caragiale later recounted, he led talks with a delegation from the Kingdom of Serbia involving the initiative to build a bridge over the Danube to link the two states. In 1913, he became a Knight of the Romanian Order of the Crown (&quot;Coroana României&quot;), received the Russian Empire&#x27;s Order of St. Anna 2nd Class. He was also awarded the &quot;Bene Merenti&quot; and &quot;Bărbăție și credință&quot; Romanian medals 1st Class. In 1913, Caragiale wrote the story &quot;Remember&quot;, while continuing his contributions to &quot;Viața Românească&quot;. Although his office was owed to Conservative-Democratic politics, Caragiale was still close to Bogdan-Pitești, whose daily newspaper &quot;Seara&quot; repeatedly published articles claiming to expose Take Ionescu&#x27;s faction and often focused such attacks on Bădărău. His employment eventually ended on January 17, 1914, as the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu came to power. According to Ion Vianu, Caragiale was right in assuming that his marginal involvement in the political intrigues had made him a target for Bădărău&#x27;s adversity.

===World War I===
During the early stages of World War I, as Romania remained a neutral country, Caragiale&#x27;s notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale&#x27;s own Germanophile preferences and traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.

A frequenter of the renowned restaurant Casa Capșa, Mateiu Caragiale was constantly surrounded by a tight group of party-goers, which included Uhrinowsky and the aristocrat Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești. They were later joined by the Russian admiral Vessiolkin, who was allegedly the illegitimate son of Emperor Alexander III. Thanks to Uhrinowsky&#x27;s intervention, Caragiale became a press correspondent for the Ottoman press agency Asmanli, a job which he held for eight months, until, as he later wrote, &quot;the [company&#x27;s] &#x27;sweet waters&#x27; dried out&quot;. In mid summer 1916, Caragiale donated money to a fund whereby the Bellu Cemetery tomb of Ștefan Luchian, a recently deceased painter and protégé of Bogdan-Pitești, was to be decorated with a bust by sculptor Dimitrie Paciurea (the world conflict and later events prevented this from happening).

As Romania joined the Allied Powers and the Romanian Campaign began, overlooked by conscription into the Romanian Army, Caragiale drafted the first of &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot;&#x27;s three sections, titled &quot;Întâmpinarea crailor&quot; (&quot;Meeting the Rakes&quot;). He would later reflect on the importance of 1916, deeming it &quot;end of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;&quot;. He did not follow the authorities and Take Ionescu&#x27;s supporters as they redeployed in Moldavia when southern Romania fell to the Central Powers, and remained in Bucharest. He was still active within the Germanophile circles, including those who opted for collaborationism, and was held in high regard by the occupying forces: his brother Luca was employed by the new administrative apparatus, but Mateiu&#x27;s own promotion to the rank of prefect was vetoed by puppet minister Lupu Kostaki. After the government of Alexandru Marghiloman signed the May 1918 capitulation in front of the Central Powers, he made known his support for the more pro-German Conservative Party: on June 29, 1918, he and Luca were among the signers of a letter addressed to the aging Petre P. Carp, the former Conservative leader, asking him to take over rule of the country. The political choice was highly controversial, and its exposure later contributed to the end of Caragiale&#x27;s political career. In a 1970 biographical essay critical of Mateiu Caragiale, Cioculescu attributed Mateiu authorship of the document, and claimed that Luca had agreed to join in only as a result of his brother&#x27;s pressures.

In 1919, as Ionescu gained political influence through his alliance with the People&#x27;s League, he became head of the press bureau of the Minister of Internal Affairs, serving until 1921. Later writings of his show that he was deeply dissatisfied with the office, which he equated with &quot;a demotion&quot;, and that he resented Ionescu not having assigned the diplomatic office of consul. He thus resigned and left the Conservative-Democrats, an action which he later defined as &quot;a grave error&quot;. Caragiale was reputedly living in penury, holding temporary residence in various cheap houses on the outskirts of Bucharest, and being thrown out from at least one such location after failing to pay his rent. Ion Vianu believes that his exclusive focus on writing &quot;Craii...&quot; had a &quot;therapeutic effect&quot;, in that it helped the writer deal with the situation.

Also in 1921, a first draft of his &quot;Remember&quot; saw print in &quot;Viața Românească&quot;. The second part of &quot;Craii...&quot;, &quot;Cele trei hagialâcuri&quot; (&quot;The Three Pilgrimages&quot;), was sporadically written between 1918 and 1921 (according to Caragiale himself: &quot;it was written on restaurant tables, in the gambling den, in the meeting hall at the Justice of the Peace&quot;). He married Marica Sion, the daughter of poet and nobleman Gheorghe Sion, in 1923, thus becoming the owner of a plot of land named &quot;Sionu&quot;, in Fundulea (although he resided in downtown Bucharest). His wife, whom he had most likely met before 1916, while attending Miller Verghy&#x27;s soirées, was his senior by 25 years. Despite owning land in the country and living a comfortable life in the city, Caragiale confessed a nostalgia towards the houses he had been raised in, and especially for his mother&#x27;s Bucharest home.

===&quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; and Italian sojourn===
Mateiu Caragiale published &quot;Remember&quot; as a volume the following year; from 1922, he began work on &quot;Spovedanii&quot; (&quot;Confessions&quot;), the third and final section of &quot;Craii...&quot;, which, as he recounted, coincided with &quot;the most terrible crisis&quot; of his life. Several of his poems were published in a 1925 collection edited by Perpessicius and Ion Pillat (&quot;Antologia poeților de azi&quot;), and were accompanied by an ink portrait signed Marcel Janco; at the time, Caragiale announced that he was going to publish a series of poems under the title &quot;Pajere&quot; (it was to be printed only after his death). In the 1925–1933 period, Caragiale&#x27;s notes show that he was seeing his life as marked by existential cycles and crucial moments.

In March 1926-October 1928, Tudor Vianu&#x27;s &quot;Gândirea&quot; magazine published his novel &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; as a series. He completed the last additions to the text in November 1927, as its first sections were already in print. As the last episode was featured by &quot;Gândirea&quot;, to widespread acclaim, he noted: &quot;From the time when the first of its parts saw print, this work was received with unprecedented fervor in Romanian literature. For the work it required, as well as for the tiresome obsession to which it had me submitted I bear it no grudge: it is truly magnificent [...].&quot; Literary historian Eugen Lovinescu, who criticized &quot;Gândirea&quot;″s later moves towards traditionalism and a far right ideology (a turn which coincided with Vianu&#x27;s departure), argued that Caragiale had been an important gain for the literary venue. In his belief, Caragiale and other &quot;writers of talent&quot; helped the magazine, which had no &quot;critic of authority&quot; at its helm.

By 1926, he rallied with the People&#x27;s League, and unsuccessfully asked Octavian Goga to assign him a candidature for a Parliamentary seat during the elections of that year. In January 1928, he again became pursuing a career in the diplomatic service, and sought an appointment for himself at the Romanian Consulate in Helsinki, Finland; he thus visited Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu in Italy, at Sanremo. His passage through Lombardy coincided with major floods, an event recorded with interest in his private notes. Titulescu received him at the Miramare Hotel, but talks between them were inconclusive. According to Perpessicius, the failure was generated by the adversity other politicians had towards Caragiale, while Ion Vianu argues that the ambition itself had constituted proof of &quot;perfect utopianism&quot;. The writer was nonetheless pleased with his visit, having been deeply impressed by the Italian landscape, and, as a result, attempted to create an atmosphere of, in his words, &quot;profound Italian rustic quietude&quot; on his property in Fundulea. His diary also perpetuated the rumor according to which Titulescu was a cocaine addict.

His political projects were put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; order, eventually becoming one of its &quot;Chevaliers&quot; in December 1929. The Romanian author himself noted that this had been made possible by the intercession of François Lebrun, the Bucharest correspondent of &quot;Le Matin&quot; newspaper, whom he considered a personal friend.

===Later years and death===

Caragiale also began work on the fragmentary writing &quot;Soborul țațelor&quot; (&quot;The Council of Busibodies&quot;, 1929) and the detective story &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot; (&quot;Under the Seal of Secrecy&quot;, 1930), but they would remain unfinished. In its first draft, &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot; was published by &quot;Gândirea&quot; in April 1930-April 1933, while &quot;Soborul țațelor&quot; was kept in three different variants. In a 1985 essay later published as a preface for &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot;, literary critic Nicolae Manolescu proposed that, while the story was not given a finishing touch, its plot was meant to seem ambiguous, and thus had led other commentators to wrongly assume that the text ended abruptly.

In 1931, the writer was still hoping for a return to the political stage, this time with the Nationalist Democratic Party, which came to power under Nicolae Iorga. To this goal, he approached Internal Affairs Undersecretary Nicolae Ottescu, requesting appointment as prefect, but was refused. During the same period, Caragiale was occasionally involved in events affecting the cultural scene. In May 1930, he was present at a banquet in honor of Italian author Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the ideologue of Futurism. Organized by the Romanian Writers&#x27; Society and the Italo-Romanian Cultural Association, it was also attended by many other cultural figures, most of which, including artist Marcel Janco and the writers Ion Vinea, Jacques G. Costin, Ion Minulescu and Camil Petrescu, were associates of the magazine &quot;Contimporanul&quot;. In January 1934, linguist and publisher Alexandru Rosetti signed a contract with Caragiale, through which the latter agreed to complete &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot; and have it published by Rosetti&#x27;s Editura Fundațiilor Regale.

He ceased most literary activities later in the year, and confessed in his diary: &quot;My spiritual state is probably the same as that of people who feel their final hour nearing and lose all hope&quot;. The writer was probably planning to move out of the city and into Fundulea, breaking all connections with his peers. Despite this abrupt change, Caragiale had not entirely abandoned his writing career. In 1931, the Oradea-based cultural magazine &quot;Cele Trei Crișuri&quot; published his memoir, titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Old Impressions of a Spectator&quot;). In it, Caragiale stated having reached &quot;a serene maturity&quot;, and indicated: &quot;I now placidly begin the rhythm of a new life.&quot; He was planning to write a biography of Albrecht Joseph Reichsgraf von Hoditz, an extravagant Silesian nobleman of the 18th century, who is briefly mentioned in &quot;Cele trei hagialâcuri&quot;, and was also interested in the works of two French classics, Antoine Furetière and Honoré de Balzac. He was preoccupied with death, which he feared greatly. In early 1935, soon after reading Stefan Zweig&#x27;s texts on faith healing, he recorded the effect it had on his life as &quot;the revelation of my intellectual superiority, my intuition and my power of reflection, as well as the latent forces that I feel at the foundation of my being.&quot; He also made a point of renouncing his hectic lifestyle, giving up alcohol and coffee.

Mateiu Caragiale died two years later in Bucharest, at the age 51, after suffering a stroke. Despite his explicit wish and opposition from his widow, speeches were held at his funeral ceremony, including ones by Alexandru Rosetti and Adrian Maniu. Rosetti and Eugen Lovinescu later recounted an unusual incident sparked by the event: Iancu Vulturescu, a friend of Caragiale&#x27;s and frequenter of Casa Capșa, looked intensely upon the dead body as he was paying his respects; later in the evening, he committed suicide in a hotel room.

==Outlook and personal life==

===Views and mannerisms===

Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s interest in heraldry and genealogy mirrored his tastes and outlook on the world, which have been described as &quot;snobbery&quot;, &quot;aestheticism&quot;, and &quot;dandyism&quot;, as well as the love of history he displayed throughout his career. It was sparked during his college years, when he would fill his notebooks with sketches of blazons, and as attested by various drawings he produced throughout his life. He also developed an enduring curiosity for astronomy, magic, as well as botany and agronomy, and kept detailed notes recording the deaths of all Romanian aristocrats who were his contemporaries.

These skills, as well as his tastes and talents as a &quot;causeur&quot;, consolidated his reputation as an erudite in spite of his lack of formal studies. The cultivation of aesthetic goals had seemingly guided the writer throughout his life—the poet and mathematician Ion Barbu, who was one of Caragiale&#x27;s greatest admirers, recounted with amazement that the writer would periodically visit the Romanian Academy&#x27;s just to look over a certain page in a manual of arithmetics outlining the rule of three (he reportedly said to Barbu: &quot;Remembering its splendor provides me with a ceaseless drive to reread it&quot;). At the same time, he was attracted by esotericism, alchemy and mystical subjects such as numerology, all of which form background elements in his prose.

A characteristic of Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s life was his search for noble origins, contrasting his illegitimate status. According to historian Lucian Nastasă, it clashed with his father&#x27;s discreetness in relation to his Greek ancestors—Ion Luca is known to have described his own origins as uncertain, even though these had been well recorded, and to have later commented that any noble lineage in Romania relied on spurious genealogies. Caragiale-father is also thought to have discouraged his son&#x27;s claims, and to have mockingly noted that their own family&#x27;s origin could not have been aristocratic. Early in his youth, Mateiu jokingly referred to himself as &quot;Prince Bassaraba-Apaffy&quot;, mixing the title used by the early Basarab Wallachian princes and the Apaffy family of Hungarian nobility. Letters he wrote while still a student show that he was envisaging a marriage of convenience as a means to increase his wealth and status.

In his permanent search for nobility rights, occasionally ascribed to the inferiority complex of illegitimate children, he indicated that his mother&#x27;s origins were in Austria-Hungary: before his marriage to Marica Sion, he claimed that he had lost his birth certificate, and, upon completing a new one, that his mother resided in Vienna, and that he himself had been born in the Transylvanian town of Tușnad. In Tudor Vianu&#x27;s view, Caragiale&#x27;s quest for &quot;an elective heredity&quot; saw him joining a diverse group of writers with similar interests, among whom were Balzac, Arthur de Gobineau, and Stefan George. Commenting that &quot;heredity has, after all, only the value of a psychological fact&quot;, he stressed: &quot;[Caragiale] thus had the right to seek his ancestry on the ascents of history and even to be ready to believe, from time to time, that he had found it.&quot;

Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian heraldry and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca&#x27;s &quot;Familii boierești române&quot; (&quot;Romanian Boyar Families&quot;). Many of the comments added by him to his copy of the book are polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while the sketches he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon displaying a donkey&#x27;s head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects he created were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign he created for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.

Other eccentricities Caragiale adopted included wearing a &quot;princely gown&quot; of his own design, developing unusual speech patterns, as well as a noted love for decorations—official honors which he tried to obtain for himself on several occasions, culminating in the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; award. He took special pride in noting that, after 14 months of governmental service, he had received the Romanian Order of the Crown and the other medals. His major regret in this respect was not having received Finland&#x27;s Order of the White Rose, having earlier claimed that he had refused the Serbian Kingdom&#x27;s Order of St. Sava when it was offered to him with a rank lower than he had asked. Ion Vianu argues that, intimately aware of his genealogical claims being questionable, the writer sought to compensate by finding his way into meritocratic environments.

===Alleged disorders and sexuality===
Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s personal life has for long attracted interest for the traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as &quot;made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew what he had said, what he had meant to say, what he is thinking.&quot; While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale&#x27;s personality as &quot;bizarre&quot;, also referred to him as &quot;colorful and sterile.&quot; Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that &quot;it kills, and many times not just figuratively&quot;. In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, in addition to his self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale&#x27;s obsession with death had developed into &quot;neurosis&quot;.

Several contemporary accounts focus on Mateiu&#x27;s unusual preferences in clothing, pointing to a studied extravagance first adopted during his stay in Berlin, and in support of which he was reportedly spending more than he could afford. Literary historian George Călinescu recalled having seen a middle-aged Caragiale taking walks through downtown Bucharest: amused by the writer&#x27;s everyday clothes, which he depicted as of an archaic fashion and slightly deteriorated, compared him to &quot;a butler on Sunday leave&quot;. Călinescu also told that, during winter, Caragiale would only touch metal with his hand while wearing suede gloves. Rosetti and poet Ștefana Velisar both recorded being amused by aspects of Caragiale&#x27;s clothing, such as his oversized boots and his using scissors to cut out the worn out extremities of his trouser legs. In 1926, the writer began wearing a ring bearing the seal of Mercury, which, Vartic supposes, evidenced his trust in the psychopomp god&#x27;s powers.

Caragiale&#x27;s secrecy and eccentricity is credited with having marked his personal life and sexuality, often with dramatic consequences. In support of this, Ion Vianu cites the writer&#x27;s alleged disdain for his mother, referencing a claim made by the socialite Grigore &quot;Grigri&quot; Ghica. The latter, familiar with Miller Verghy and her circle, recounted that the poverty-stricken but proud Caragiale had asked their common female friend to allow him use of a stable on her property, explaining that he was going to have furniture moved in. According to Ghica, the owners were shocked to discover that the stable had been used instead to accommodate Maria Constantinescu. Ion Vianu also notes that Caragiale &quot;appears to have been in love for just one moment&quot;, referring to his 1907 pursuit of an upper-class French girl, Fernande de Bondy, who rejected his advances and complained to Caragiale-father. For a while in 1908, Caragiale had a brief affair with a reportedly unattractive Frenchwoman, Mariette Lamboley, who had been a Roman Catholic nun. In letters he sent to his close friend, Nicolae Boicescu, Caragiale bragged about his sexual exploits with Lamboley, and of having exposed her to &quot;the most terrifying sadisms&quot; (which included allowing her to be raped by a stranger in the Cișmigiu Gardens).

Notes in his diaries show that he discreetly resented Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, although, Ion Vianu stresses, such pronouncements appear to have become a staple of Caragiale&#x27;s private records only long after Bogdan-Pitești had died. Aside from claiming to expose his patron&#x27;s alleged financing by the Central Powers before and during World War I, Caragiale discussed Bogdan-Pitești&#x27;s homosexuality in disparaging terms (calling him &quot;a blusterer of the anti-natural vice&quot;), and even laying out a plan to rob his residence. The violent solution to poverty, Ion Vianu proposes, may have reflected his appreciation for Félicien Champsaur&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arriviste&quot;, in which the protagonist uses murder to affirm himself socially. Despite Caragiale&#x27;s relationships with women and his lapses into homophobia, Ion Vianu argues (partly building on similar comments made by literary historian Matei Călinescu) that the writer had a preference for homosociality or even homoeroticism, both in line with his narcissism. Caragiale&#x27;s diary also dealt with Bogdan-Pitești&#x27;s wife, the socialite Domnica, depicting her as an immoral woman. A person known by the initials &quot;A.K.&quot;, who was probably the same as Domnica, is referred to in such notes as being in a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; situation with Bogdan-Pitești and Caragiale. He confessed being thankful that the long record of sums he had borrowed from Bogdan-Pitești beginning 1916 had been destroyed, probably by Domnica, at a time when his patron was on his deathbed.

Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s final erotic pursuit was the high society lady and amateur singer Eliza &quot;Elise&quot; Băicoianu. He courted her for a few months in 1932, despite being married to Marica Sion. His private notes show that he struggled with the lust for Băicoianu, which he believed was impairing his judgment, and declared himself outraged that the object of his affection had a &quot;scandalous liaison&quot; with another man. He ultimately decided not to persevere, basing himself on the principle that &quot;business is business.&quot; In his final years, Caragiale was weighing in the probability of his still fathering a male son, and, although he concluded that it was not likely, laid out a &quot;Family Law&quot; for his potential descendants to abide by.

==Work==

===Literary style===
Writing shortly after Caragiale died, Tudor Vianu defined him as &quot;a figure, possibly a delayed one, from that aesthetic generation of around 1880, who professed a concept of the supremacy of artistic values in life.&quot; This allowed him to draw a parallel between Mateiu Caragiale and Alexandru Macedonski, the doyen of Romanian Symbolism, with the one essential difference provided by their level of involvement in cultural affairs. Unlike his half-brother Luca, Caragiale tended to stay away from the literary movements of his age, and placed his cultural references in the relative past, being inspired by Romantic and Symbolist authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam, Jules Amédée Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly, Charles Baudelaire and José María de Heredia. Noting the manifest difference in style between the realist Ion Luca and his two sons, Vianu pointed out that the three shared, as characteristic traits, &quot;The cultivation of developed forms, the view of art as a closed system resistant to the anarchic forces of reality&quot;. According to Cioculescu, Mateiu&#x27;s work would be &quot;minor, unless placed alongside that of Ion Luca Caragiale&quot;. Elsewhere, Cioculescu indicated that a letter written by Mateiu Caragiale in his early youth, which featured his first pieces of social commentary, imitated his father&#x27;s calligraphy to the point where George Călinescu initially believed they were the work of Ion Luca. Literary critic Paul Cernat proposes that the clashes between father and son evidenced Mateiu&#x27;s &quot;maternal attachment and a break with paternal authority&quot;, and, in particular, his &quot;Oedipus complex&quot;, which he also sees manifested in the personality of modern Romanian writers such as the avant-garde founding figure Urmuz and the co-founder of Dadaism, Tristan Tzara.

Discussing Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s originality, Călinescu saw in him &quot;a promoter (maybe the first) of literary Balkanism, that greasy mix of obscene phrases, lascivious impulses, awareness of an adventurous and fuzzy genealogy, everything purified and seen from above by a superior intelligence&quot;. In relation to Romanian literature, he believed to have discovered a common trait of &quot;Balkan&quot; writers of mostly Wallachian origin, citing Mateiu Caragiale in a group that also included Caragiale-father, the early 19th century aphorist and printer Anton Pann, the modern poets Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu and Ion Barbu, and Urmuz. He went on to define this gathering as &quot;the great grimacing sensitive ones, buffoons with just too much plastic intelligence.&quot; In parallel, Lovinescu saw Caragiale as one in a group of modernist prose writers who sought to reshape the genre through the use of lyricism, and were thus paradoxically outdated by 20th century standards. The delayed character of Caragiale&#x27;s contribution was also mentioned by literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who identified its roots in Art Nouveau and, through it, the subjects of Byzantine art.

Among other traits which set Caragiale apart from his fellow Romanian writers was his highly creative vocabulary, partly reliant on archaisms and words occurring rarely in the modern Romanian lexis (including ones borrowed from Turkish and Greek, or even from Romani). In certain cases, he used an inventive spelling—for example, he consistently rendered the word for &quot;charm&quot;, &quot;farmec&quot;, as &quot;&quot;. Tudor Vianu noted that this habit was similar to experiments presents in Ion Barbu&#x27;s cryptic poetry, ascribing both cases to &quot;the intent of underlining the differentiation between the written and the spoken words&quot;, while Ion Vianu defined Caragiale as &quot;an accurate artisan of the language, an extraordinary connaisseur of the Romanian language, which, out of snobbery, he sets aside for the plebeian readers.&quot; &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; introduces a large array of words present in early 20th century slang and Romanian profanity, as well as rendering the then-common habit of borrowing whole sentences from French to express oneself (a trait notably present in Mateiu Cargiale&#x27;s own day-to-day vocabulary). The novel&#x27;s tone, often irreverent, and the book&#x27;s foray into the mundane have been seem by some as tributary to the informal style cultivated by Bogdan-Pitești.

Most of Caragiale&#x27;s prose is interconnected through allusions to himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts are characterized by precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author&#x27;s familiarity with Antoine Furetière&#x27;s vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac&#x27;s &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;, in particular its &quot;Thirteen&quot; cycle—which is known to have been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.

===Novel===
A first-person narrative, &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; traces and satirizes Romanian society in the early decades of the 20th century (it probably depicts events from ca. 1910). A core group of three persons, all withdrawn, Epicurean and decadent figures, allow the intrusion of Gore Pirgu, a low-class and uncultured self-seeker, whose character comes to embody the new political class of Greater Romania. Researcher Constantin Amăriuței proposed that there is an intrinsic connection between Pirgu and Mitică, a voluble clerk depicted in several sketch stories by Ion Luca Caragiale, and best remembered as a stereotype of Bucharesters; according to Amăriuței, Pirgu is &quot;the eternal and real Mitică of the Romanian world&quot;. According to Matei Călinescu, the story is intertextually shaped by two of Ion Luca&#x27;s prose works: one of them, titled &quot;Inspecțiune...&quot; (&quot;Inspection...&quot;), is part of the Mitică cycle, while the other, &quot;Grand Hotel &quot;Victoria română&quot;&quot;, is one of the earliest depictions of anxiety in the literature of Romania. For Matei Călinescu, Pirgu and the other protagonists stand as allegories for a set of essentially Romanian traits that, he argues, were still observable in the early 21st century.

In direct reference to &quot;Craii...&quot;, George Călinescu wrote: &quot;Reality is transfigured, it becomes fantastical and a sort of Edgar Poe-like unease agitates [the main characters], these good-for-nothings of the old Romanian capital.&quot; This, he argued, validated placing Caragiale&#x27;s novel among Surrealist writings, and alongside the works of eclectic authors such as Barbu and Ion Vinea. Literary historian Eugen Simion notes that Barbu believed himself thought Caragiale&#x27;s prose was equal in value to the poetry of Romania&#x27;s national poet Mihai Eminescu, and argues that this perspective was exaggerated.

Writing in 2007, Cernat also noted a similarity between Vinea&#x27;s 1930 collection of novellas, &quot;Paradisul suspinelor&quot; (&quot;The Paradise of Sighs&quot;), and Caragiale&#x27;s &quot;Craii...&quot;, defining the two books as &quot;poetic, mannerist and fantastic&quot;, and stressing that they both portray decadent characters. Building on the observations of his older colleague Simion Mioc, Cernat commented that Vinea, Mateiu Caragiale, N. Davidescu and Adrian Maniu, all members of the same &quot;post-Symbolist&quot; generation, ultimately traced their inspiration to Alexandru Macedonski and his Symbolist work &quot;Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu&quot;. He also proposed that, less directly, Macedonski&#x27;s themes and style also influenced similar prose works by Arghezi and Urmuz.

Several critics and researchers have pointed out that, in &quot;Craii...&quot;, Caragiale used characters and dialogues to illustrate his own worldview and historical points of reference. Among the rich cultural references present in the novel, Șerban Cioculescu identified various direct or hidden portrayals of Caragiale&#x27;s contemporaries, several of which point to his own family. Thus, Cioculescu argued, the character Zinca Mamonoaia is the writer&#x27;s step aunt Catinca Momuloaia, while an entire passage sheds a negative light on Ion Luca (the unnamed &quot;leading writer of the nation&quot; who prostitutes his trade). Commenting on the brief mention of one of Pirgu&#x27;s associates, &quot;the theosophist Papura Jilava&quot;, the critic concluded that it most likely referred to novelist and traveler Bucura Dumbravă.

Cioculescu identifies several other characters, including Pirgu and two secondary characters, the journalist Uhry and the homosexual diplomat Poponel, were Caragiale&#x27;s companions: the latter two were based, respectively, on Uhrinowsky and a member of &quot;an old Oltenian family&quot;. Ion Vianu, who believes the unnamed narrator is a projection of Caragiale&#x27;s ego, emphasizes connections between the various characters and other real-life persons, including Ion Luca, Bogdan-Pitești and Anghel Demetriescu. In addition, Barbu Cioculescu believed to have identified other traits shared by the narrator and author, as well as a covert reference to Marica Sion, while researcher Radu Cernătescu suggests further allusions to real-life eccentric noblemen, from Pantazi Ghica to &quot;Claymoor&quot; Văcărescu. Perpessicus noted that, in one of his outbursts, the character Pașadia criticizes the Brâncovenesc style developed in 17th century Romanian art (which he contrasts with &quot;the tumultuous flowering of the baroque&quot;), only to have the narrator speak out against him; in the process, the reader is informed about Caragiale&#x27;s own tastes.

===Other prose works===

&quot;Remember&quot; is a fantasy novella set in Berlin, depicting dramatic events in the life of dandy Aubrey de Vere. Perpessicius argued that the main protagonist was &quot;taken, apparently, from a short story by Oscar Wilde&quot;, while others noted a direct reference to the 19th century writer Aubrey de Vere, an indirect one to Poe&#x27;s &quot;Lenore&quot; (the lyric: &quot;And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore!&quot;), or a partial anagram of the name &quot;Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly&quot;. The mysterious events standing at the center of the writing have been interpreted by several critics as an allusion to de Vere&#x27;s homosexuality. Probably taking place in 1907, it contrasts Caragiale&#x27;s other, more tenebrous, writings of its kind—one of its main traits is the writer&#x27;s nostalgia towards the German capital, which serves to give the story an atmospheric rather than narrative quality. Its depiction of hallucinatory visions probably owes inspiration to Gérard de Nerval, while, according to historian Sorin Antohi, the main character is reminiscent of Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27; Des Esseintes (&quot;see À rebours&quot;). Lovinescu praises the story for &quot;the gravity of its tone, [...] the cadence of its sumptuous, cultured and noble style.&quot; George Călinescu, who referred to the narrative as &quot;a pastiche&quot;, and to Berlin as portrayed in Caragiale&#x27;s story as &quot;a Berlin-Sodom&quot;, concluded that the text allowed readers to form &quot;the direct sensation&quot; of Bucharest as a &quot;Balkan Sodom&quot; to be discerned from the German landscape.

Caragiale&#x27;s &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot; has been the subject of debates in the literary community. One disagreement refers to its nature: some see it as a standalone novella, while others, including Alexandru George, view it as an unfinished novel. In this context, a singular position was held by Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who believed that Caragiale was building up to a sequel of his &quot;Craii...&quot;. The other point of contention involves its artistic value. Ovidiu Cotruș saw the story as proof that Mateiu Caragiale was running out of &quot;narrative resourcefulness&quot; and creating &quot;the [writing] most detached from his work&#x27;s obsessions&quot;, while Șerban Cioculescu deplored Caragiale&#x27;s move to abandon work on &quot;Soborul țațelor&quot; (which he considered a more promising venture) in order to &quot;implant a sort of Romanian detective novel&quot;.

Written as a frame story, &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot; comprises the recollections of Teodor &quot;Rache&quot; Ruse, a retired Police officer. Punctuated by willing omissions, for which rows of ellipses are employed, the text is structured into accounts of three unsolved cases: that of a missing person, the clerk Gogu Nicolau, who may or may not have been murdered by his wife; that of an epileptic minister whom Ruse is supposed to guard and who, after going missing and returning, presents his resignation and dies, leaving the general public clueless as to his fate; finally, that of a Viennese couple of con artists and presumed murderers (one of whom may be a transvestite woman) whose arrival in Bucharest poses a threat on the life of their female host, Lena Ceptureanu. Ruse&#x27;s accounts, which oblique references in the text seem to place in 1930, form part of his conversations with the unnamed narrator, which are set in Caru cu bere restaurant and in the narrator&#x27;s Bucharest home; this, Manolescu notes, echoes scenes in &quot;Craii...&quot;. A recurring element in the plot is the role played by secretive women, who may be directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of male characters. Commentators have since attempted to match several of the protagonists with real people in Caragiale&#x27;s life. Such theories identify Rache Ruse himself with Cantuniari, a policeman whom Caragiale had befriended, the minister with the leading Conservative Party member Alexandru Lahovary, and the female character Arethy with Miller Verghy.

According to Manolescu, Mateiu Caragiale took direct inspiration from foreign works of detective fiction when outlining his story, but also mocked their conventions by having Ruse rely on literature and even cartomancy for his crime solving techniques. Vartic drew a parallel between Caragiale&#x27;s style and that of two 20th century foreign authors of crime fiction—Dashiell Hammett and Giorgio Bassani. The general intent, Manolescu notes, is not in realistically depicting police procedures, but in showing &quot;the human mystery.&quot; Thus, Ion Vartic argues, Gogu Nicolau may be Caragiale&#x27;s attempt to see himself from the outside, and his disappearance may be a clue that the writer was planning to sever links with the cultural milieu. The work&#x27;s title and its generic meaning are found in Ruse&#x27;s final statement: &quot;There are such things meant to always remain—since forever—under the seal of secrecy.&quot;

===Poetry===
Caragiale&#x27;s Symbolist poems, including a series of sonnets, also display his profound interest in history. &quot;Pajere&quot;, which reunited all of the poems Caragiale had published in &quot;Viața Românească&quot; and &quot;Flacăra&quot;, was defined by Lovinescu as a series of &quot;toned tableaux of our ancient existence&quot;, and by Ion Vianu as &quot;a picturesque history of Wallachia&quot;, while George Călinescu remarks their &quot;savant&quot; character. The same critic also noted that &quot;Pajere&quot;, which drew inspiration from Byzantine settings, were more accomplished versions of a genre first cultivated by Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu. According to Perpessicius, Caragiale had &quot;a certain outlook [...], according to which the past [...] should not be sought in books, but in the surrounding landscape&quot;. He illustrated this notion with a stanza from Caragiale&#x27;s &quot;Clio&quot;:
Călinescu noted that, in several of his poems, Mateiu Caragiale had infused his search for aristocratic heredities. He saw this present in the poem &quot;Lauda cuceritorului&quot; (&quot;In Praise of the Conqueror&quot;):
In various pieces, the poetic language is characterized by pessimism, and, according to Barbu Cioculescu and Ion Vianu, was influenced by Romania&#x27;s national poet, Mihai Eminescu. One of them, &quot;Singurătatea&quot; (&quot;The Loneliness&quot;), notably expresses, through the voice of its demonic protagonist, misanthropy and a vengeful attitude, believed by Vianu to stand as one of Caragiale&#x27;s most personal messages on one&#x27;s disappointment with the world:
==Legacy==

===Early decades===
Caragiale continued to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his work went through new critical editions. &quot;Pajere&quot; was published in spring 1936, having been edited by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of collected works, &quot;Opere&quot;, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. The transcript made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires&#x27; Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale&#x27;s criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca&#x27;s daughter, and never recovered. A significant number of his drawings and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been misplaced.

Caragiale&#x27;s work exercised some influence from early on. Ion Barbu coined the terms &quot;mateist&quot; and &quot;matein&quot;, referring, respectively, to supporters of and things connected to Caragiale&#x27;s literature. Barbu is also credited with having set up and presided the first &quot;mateist&quot; circle. In 1947, Ion Barbu wrote the poem &quot;Protocol al unui Club&quot; (&quot;The Protocol of a Club&quot;), intended as an homage to his friend&#x27;s memory. The traditionalist poet Sandu Tudor took up the genre of Byzantine portraits as cultivated by him and by Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu, creating a piece titled &quot;Comornic&quot; (roughly, &quot;Cellar&quot; or &quot;Cellar-Keeper&quot;). Around the same period, the writer known as Sărmanul Klopștock took inspiration from the style of his novels.

===&quot;Mateism&quot; under communism===

&quot;Mateism&quot;, growing during the late stages of the interwar period, took the aspect of an underground cultural phenomenon during the communist regime. Tașcu Gheorghiu, a Surrealist author whose Bohemian lifestyle was itself described as a reflection of &quot;Craii...&quot;, had memorized large sections of the novel and could recite them by heart. According to Eugen Simion, dramatist Aurel Baranga is reputed to have done the same. During communism, Gheorghiu published a translation from Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa&#x27;s &quot;The Leopard&quot;, which literary critic Carmen Mușat believes was marked by the tone of &quot;mateism&quot;. Caragiale&#x27;s aesthetics contrasted with those of the 1950s Socialist Realist establishment. However, after the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signaled a relative change in cultural tenets, Communist Party affiliate and writer Petru Dumitriu wrote in favor of recovering supposed &quot;realistic sections&quot; of works by both Mateiu Caragiale and Tudor Arghezi. Eugen Simion writes that, late in the same decade, students at the University of Bucharest were investing their time trying to determine the exact location of houses described in &quot;Craii...&quot;. Also according to Eugen Simion, an attempt by poet Anatol E. Baconsky to republish the volume was met with a stiff reaction from the censorship apparatus, and, as a consequence of this episode, the main Communist Party organ, &quot;Scînteia&quot;, renewed its campaign against Caragiale. Matei Călinescu recalled that, &quot;during the dark 1950–60 decade&quot;, he clandestinely read &quot;Craii...&quot; and shared his thoughts on it with a group of friends, noting that this was part of a &quot;secret life&quot; which contrasted with the rigors one had to obey in public.

With the relative liberalization during the 1960s, which followed the rise of Nicolae Ceaușescu as communist leader, Caragiale&#x27;s work enjoyed a more favorable reception. At that stage, nationalism and national communism became standards of official discourse, and intellectuals such as Edgar Papu were allowed to reinterpret Romanian culture on the basis of nationalist tenets: Papu&#x27;s controversial theory, known as &quot;protochronism&quot;, claimed that Romanians as a group were at the source of any innovative movement in world culture. Papu thus believed that Caragiale, whom he described as superior to Flaubert, had foreshadowed Lampedusa&#x27;s writing techniques. Independent of this approach, Mateiu Caragiale was being rediscovered by new generations of writers. In 1966, &quot;Viața Românească&quot; published Radu Albala&#x27;s &quot;În deal, pe Militari&quot; (&quot;On the Hill, in Militari&quot;), which was a sequel and final chapter of &quot;Sub pecetea tainei&quot;. Albala was significantly influenced by Caragiale throughout his work, as was his contemporary Alexandru George in his series of fiction writings. Other such authors are Fănuș Neagu, who was inspired by &quot;Craii...&quot; to write his 1976 book &quot;The Handsome Lunatics of the Big Cities&quot;, and Virgiliu Stoenescu, whose poetry, according to Barbu Cioculescu, was influenced by &quot;the charm of word appositions&quot; in Caragiale&#x27;s poems. Caragiale&#x27;s name was also cited by the writer Geo Bogza, who, in his youth, was a major figure of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In one of his late prose pieces, titled &quot;Ogarii&quot;, &quot;The Borzois&quot;, Bogza, who praised the dog breed for its innate grace, wrote: &quot;I do not know if Mateiu Caragiale, who thought himself so uncommon, ever owned borzois. But, if he did, I&#x27;m sure he gazed on them with melancholy and with secret envy.&quot;

During the final stages of Ceaușescu&#x27;s rule, when liberalization was curbed, &quot;matein&quot; writings were rediscovered and reclaimed by the &quot;Optzeciști&quot; group of authors, themselves noted for attempting to evade cultural guidelines by adopting fantasy and avant-garde literature. Mircea Cărtărescu, a leading exponent of the &quot;Optzeciști&quot; and an advocate of Postmodernism, referred to Caragiale as one of his interwar precursors, while Ștefan Agopian acknowledged he pursued Mateiu&#x27;s interests in his 1981 novel &quot;Tache de catifea&quot; (&quot;Tache de Velvet&quot;). According to critic Dumitru Ungureanu, it was mainly through Radu Albala that the &quot;matein&quot; model seeped into the work of various &quot;Optzeciști&quot;—Cărtărescu, Horia Gârbea and Florin Șlapac among them. Another Postmodernist author, Fundulea native Mircea Nedelciu, paid tribute to &quot;matein&quot; prose by basing a character of his 1986 novel &quot;&quot; (&quot;Confambulatory Treatment&quot;) on Caragiale, and again much later, by adopting the same practice in his final novel &quot;Zodia Scafandrului&quot; (&quot;Sign of the Deep-sea Diver&quot;). The isolated Postmodernist figure and former Communist Party ideologue Paul Georgescu is also believed to have used elements of &quot;Craii...&quot; as inspiration for his novels of the 1980s. In parallel, as an echo of &quot;mateism&quot;, more critics grew interested in subjects relating to Caragiale&#x27;s work. Various comprehensive monographs were published after 1980, including a volume edited by the Museum of Romanian Literature and two influential works written by, respectively, Alexandru George and philosopher Vasile Lovinescu. The latter, with its claim to uncover esoteric layers in Matein texts, remains controversial.

===Post-1989 recovery and debates===
Caragiale was completely recovered in mainstream cultural circles after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; was chosen &quot;best Romanian novel of the twentieth century&quot; in an early 2001 poll conducted among 102 Romanian literary critics by the literary magazine &quot;Observator Cultural&quot;, while its author endures as one of the most-studied Romanian fiction writers. The writer, his prose works, and the manner in which the reader relates to them were the themes for a 2003 book by Matei Călinescu, titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Mateiu I. Caragiale: Re-readings&quot;). Several other new monographs were dedicated to Caragiale, including a favorable review of his work authored by literary researcher Ion Iovan in 2002. Iovan is noted for defending Caragiale against the traditional topics of criticism. In contrast to his father Șerban, who was often a vocal critic of Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s literature and lifestyle choices, Barbu Cioculescu is likewise one of the writer&#x27;s most noted promoters, and has occasionally been described as a &quot;mateist&quot;.

Reflecting on Mateiu&#x27;s growing popularity, Matei Călinescu has argued that &quot;Craii...&quot; is to Romanian literature what &quot;El Aleph&quot; is in the eponymous Jorge Luis Borges story: a place containing all other conceivable places. In his 2008 synthesis, &quot;Istoria critică a literaturii române&quot; (&quot;The Critical History of Romanian Literature&quot;), Nicolae Manolescu revisits George Călinescu&#x27;s pronouncements on interwar literature. Manolescu places Mateiu Caragiale, Max Blecher, Anton Holban and Ion Pillat, all of whom do not take the forefront in Călinescu&#x27;s work, among their generation&#x27;s &quot;canonical writers&quot;. A diverging opinion was expressed by literary critic and Anglicist Mircea Mihăieș, who suggested that, despite the theoretical potential presented by Mateiu&#x27;s lifestyle and background, &quot;Craii...&quot; is primarily a poorly written work, characterized by &quot;a disconcerting naïvite&quot;, &quot;kitsch&quot; aesthetics and &quot;embarrassing affectations&quot;. Mihăieș, who believes that Caragiale&#x27;s only valuable writings are &quot;Pajere&quot; and his private correspondence, further suggests that Caragiale&#x27;s various admirers, including exegetes such as Matei Călinescu, Vasile Lovinescu, Ovidiu Cotruș and Ion Negoițescu, are responsible for overvaluing their favorite author.

In 2001, Caragiale&#x27;s collected writings, edited by Barbu Cioculescu, were republished in a single edition, while his copy of Octav-George Lecca&#x27;s &quot;Familii boierești române&quot;, featuring his many comments and sketches, was the basis for a 2002 reprint. In addition to the volumes of recollections by &quot;Grigri&quot; Ghica and Ionel Gherea, Mateiu Caragiale is mentioned in Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești&#x27;s book of memoirs, &quot;Troica amintirilor. Sub patru regi&quot; (&quot;The Troika of Recollections. Under Four Kings&quot;), published only after the Revolution. The work depicts notable episodes in his Bohemian life, including a scene where the overweight and inebriated Admiral Vessiolkin leaps over tables at Casa Capșa and recites English-language quotes from William Shakespeare to an audience comprising Caragiale and various by-standers. In 2007, &quot;Remember&quot; was issued as an audiobook, read by actor Marcel Iureș.

In the post-Revolution era, authors continued to take direct inspiration from Caragiale. In 2008, Ion Iovan published &quot;Ultimele însemnări ale lui Mateiu Caragiale&quot; (&quot;Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s Final Records&quot;), a mock-diary and speculative fiction work covering the final events in Caragiale&#x27;s life. In addition to covering the elements of his biography, it invents a character by the name of Jean Mathieu, Caragiale&#x27;s secret son. Caragiale&#x27;s work was also treasured by Romanian-language writers in newly independent Moldova, formerly part of the Soviet Union. One of them, Anatol Moraru, wrote &quot;Craii de modă nouă&quot; (&quot;A New Fashion of Rakes&quot;), which is both a memoir and a tribute to &quot;Craii...&quot;.

===Visual tributes, filmography and landmarks===

Published within the 1925 anthology compiled by Perpessicius and Pillat, Marcel Janco&#x27;s modernist portraits of Caragiale and avant-garde writer Stephan Roll, were described by a number critics as Expressionist in style, based on their &quot;energetic and spontaneous superposition of lines.&quot; One later reprint of &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot; was notably illustrated with drawings by graphic artist George Tomaziu.

An eponymous stage version of &quot;Craii...&quot;, directed by Alexandru Repan was performed by the Nottara Theater company, with stage design by Sică Rudescu. Dramatist Radu Macrinici also adapted fragments from the novel, alongside texts by Ion Luca and Ion Luca&#x27;s uncle Iorgu Caragiale, into the play &quot;Un prieten de când lumea?&quot; (&quot;A Friend as Old as Time?&quot;). In 2009, actor-choreographer Răzvan Mazilu adapted &quot;Remember&quot; into an eponymous musical theater and contemporary ballet piece, set to the music of Richard Wagner. The original cast included Mazilu as Aubrey de Vere and Ion Rizea as Mr. M. (a character loosely based on Caragiale), with a set design and videos by Dionisis Christofilogiannis.

In the early 1970s, Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s life inspired a Romanian Television production produced and directed by Stere Gulea. In 1995, &quot;Craii...&quot; was turned into an eponymous cinema production, directed by Mircea Veroiu. It starred Mircea Albulescu, Marius Bodochi, and Gheorghe Dinică. The book and its author were also the subject of one episode in a documentary series produced by journalist and political scientist Stelian Tănase, dealing with the history of Bucharest; titled &quot;București, strict secret&quot; (&quot;Bucharest, Top Secret&quot;), it was aired by Realitatea TV in 2007.

Mateiu Caragiale&#x27;s name was assigned to a street in Bucharest (and officially spelled &quot;Matei Caragiale&quot; in this context). Formerly known as &quot;Strada Constituției&quot; (&quot;Constitution Street&quot;), it is located in a low-income area on the outskirts of Drumul Taberei quarter.

<doc id="1223515" wikidata="Q1258037" url="?curid=1223515" title="Epitrachelion">
<text>The epitrachelion ( &quot;around the neck&quot;; Slavic: Епитрахи́ль - &quot;Epitrakhíl’&quot;; often called simply a &quot;stole&quot; in casual English-language usage) is the liturgical vestment worn by priests and bishops of the Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches as the symbol of their priesthood, corresponding to the Western stole. It is essentially the &quot;orarion&quot; adapted for priests and bishops, worn around the neck with two ends of equal length hanging down in front of the clergyman&#x27;s body (more or less to the ankle) and with the two adjacent sides sewn or buttoned together up the center, leaving enough space through which to place the head. In practice, the &quot;epitrachelion&quot; is made to be worn only this way, tailored to lie flat around the neck, and is never actually unfastened. The portion hanging down in front is sometimes even a solid piece of fabric. It is usually made of brocade with seven embroidered or appliquéd crosses, one at the back of the neck and three down each side. The &quot;epitrachelion&quot; is the only required vestment whenever a priest is conducting an Orthodox service; without it, he is unable to perform the service.

==Background==

The priest wears the &quot;epitrachelion&quot; whenever serving as a priest (as opposed to simply attending a service). For some services, &quot;e.g.&quot; vespers or matins, he wears the &quot;epitrachelion&quot; by itself. When he is fully vested for the Divine Liturgy, he wears the &quot;epitrachelion&quot; over the &quot;sticharion&quot; and under the &quot;zone&quot; and the &quot;phelonion&quot;. If a priest is simply attending a service, he wears no vestments, but will put on his &quot;epitrachelion&quot; (and often his &quot;epimanikia&quot;) before receiving the Eucharist.

When the bishop is fully vested he wears the &quot;epitrachelion&quot; over the &quot;sticharion&quot; and under the zone, the &quot;sakkos&quot; and the &quot;omophorion&quot;.

The Syriac Orthodox &quot;hamnikho&quot; (literally &#x27;necklace&#x27;) and the Armenian Orthodox &quot;urār&quot; are worn in a similar fashion.

<text>Hot sauce is a type of condiment, seasoning, or salsa made from chili peppers and other ingredients. Many commercial varieties of mass-produced hot sauce exist.

==History==
Humans have used chili peppers and other hot spices for thousands of years. One of the first commercially available bottled hot sauces in the United States appeared in 1807 in Massachusetts. However, few of the early brands from the 1800s survived to this day. Tabasco sauce, produced by the McIlhenny Company, is the earliest recognizable brand in the United States hot sauce industry, appearing in 1868. As of 2010, it was the 13th best-selling seasoning in the United States preceded by Frank&#x27;s RedHot Sauce in 12th place, which claims to be the sauce first used to create buffalo wings.

Many recipes for hot sauces exist, but the only common ingredient is some variety of chili pepper. Many hot sauces are made by using chili peppers as the base and can be as simple as adding salt and vinegar. Other sauces use some type of fruits or vegetables as the base and add the chili peppers to make them hot. Manufacturers use many different processes from aging in containers to pureeing and cooking the ingredients to achieve a desired flavor. Because of their ratings on the Scoville scale, spicier peppers such as the Ghost pepper, Scotch bonnet or Habanero pepper are sometimes used to make hotter sauces. Alternatively, other ingredients can be used to add extra heat, such as pure capsaicin extract or mustard oil. Other common sauce ingredients include vinegar and spices. Vinegar is used primarily as a natural preservative, but flavored vinegars can be used to alter the flavour.

==Styles==
===Americas===

==== Belize ====
Belizean hot sauces are usually extremely hot and use habaneros, carrots, and onions as primary ingredients. Marie Sharp&#x27;s is a popular brand of hot sauce produced in the Stann Creek Valley.

==== Bermuda ====
Bermudian sherry peppers sauce is made from a base of Spanish sherry wine and hot peppers. The major producer on the island is Outerbridge Peppers.

==== Caribbean ====
Hot pepper sauces, as they are most commonly known there, feature heavily in Caribbean cuisine. They are prepared from chilli peppers and vinegar, with fruits and vegetables added for extra flavor. The most common peppers used are habanero and Scotch bonnet, the latter being the most common in Jamaica. Both are very hot peppers, making for strong sauces. Over the years, each island developed its own distinctive recipes, and home-made sauces are still common.

===== Trinidad =====
Trinidad Scorpion is considered one of the hottest and most frutal families of strains, and is primarily cultivated and hybridized in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.

===== Barbados =====
Bajan pepper sauce, a mustard and Scotch bonnet pepper based hot sauce.

===== Haiti =====
Sauce Ti-malice, typically made with habanero, shallots, lime juice, garlic and sometimes tomatoes

===== Puerto Rico =====
small piquins (&quot;bird peppers&quot;) with annatto seeds, coriander leaves, onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Pique () sauce is a Puerto Rican hot sauce made by steeping hot peppers in vinegar. Don Ricardo Original Pique Sauce, which is made with pineapple, is a Puerto Rican staple. Don Ricardo originated in Utuado (Spanish pronunciation: [uˈtwaðo]) a municipality of Puerto Rico located in the central mountainous region of the island known as La Cordillera Central.

===== Jamaica =====
Scotch bonnets are the most popular peppers used in Jamaica. Pickapeppa sauce is a Jamaican sauce.

==== Chile ====
The most popular sauce is the Diaguitas brand, made of pure red (very hot) or yellow (hot) Chilean peppers mixed only with water and salt. Other hot sauces are made from &quot;puta madre&quot;, &quot;cacho de cabra&quot;, &quot;rocoto&quot;, &quot;oro&quot; and &quot;cristal&quot; peppers, mixed with various ingredients. Mild hot sauces include some &quot;creamy style&quot; (like &quot;ají crema&quot;), or a pebre-style sauce, from many local producers, varying in hotness and quality.

==== Mexico ====
Mexican cuisine more often includes chopped chili peppers, but when hot sauces are used, they are typically focused more on flavor than on intense heat. Chipotle peppers are a very popular ingredient of Mexican hot sauce. Vinegar is used sparingly or not at all in Mexican sauces, but some particular styles are high in vinegar content similar to the American Louisiana-style sauces. Some hot sauces may include using the seeds from the popular achiote plant for coloring or a slight flavor additive. The process of adobos (marinade) has been used in the past as a preservative but now it is mainly used to enhance the flavor of the peppers and they rely more on the use of vinegar. Mexican-style sauces are primarily produced in Mexico but they are also produced internationally. The Spanish term for sauce is salsa, and in English-speaking countries usually refers to the often tomato-based, hot sauces typical of Mexican cuisine, particularly those used as dips. There are many types of salsa which usually vary throughout Latin America.

These are some of the notable companies producing Mexican style hot sauce.

*Búfalo: A popular Mexican sauce
*Cholula Hot Sauce: Known for its iconic round wooden cap
*Valentina: A traditional Mexican sauce
*El Yucateco: A popular Mexican sauce

==== Panama ====
Traditional Panamanian hot sauce is usually made with &quot;Aji Chombo&quot;, Scotch Bonnet peppers. Picante Chombo D&#x27;Elidas is a popular brand in Panama, with three major sauces. The yellow sauce, made with habanero and mustard, is the most distinctive. They also produce red and green varieties which are heavier on vinegar content and without mustard. Although the majority of Panamanian cuisine lacks in spice, D&#x27;Elidas is seen as an authentic Panamanian hot sauce usually serviced with Rice with Chicken or soups.

==== United States ====
In the United States, commercially produced chili sauces are assigned various grades per their quality. These grades include U.S. Grade A (also known as U.S. Fancy), U.S. Grade C (also known as U.S. Standard) and Substandard. Criteria in food grading for chili sauces in the U.S. includes coloration, consistency, character, absence of defects and flavor.
The varieties of peppers that are used often are cayenne, chipotle, habanero and jalapeño. Some hot sauces, notably Tabasco sauce, are aged in wooden casks similar to the preparation of wine and fermented vinegar. Other ingredients, including fruits and vegetables such as raspberries, mangoes, carrots, and chayote squash are sometimes used to add flavor, mellow the heat of the chilis, and thicken the sauce&#x27;s consistency. Artisan hot sauces are manufactured by smaller producers and private labels in the United States. Their products are produced in smaller quantities in a variety of flavors. Many sauces have a theme to catch consumers attention. A very mild chili sauce is produced by Heinz and other manufacturers, and is frequently found in cookbooks in the U.S. This style chili sauce is based on tomatoes, green and/or red bell peppers, and spices; and contains little chili pepper. This sauce is more akin to tomato ketchup and cocktail sauce than predominantly chili pepper-based sauces.

A type of sriracha sauce manufactured in California by Huy Fong Foods has become increasingly popular in the United States in contemporary times.

===== Louisiana-style =====
Louisiana-style hot sauce contains red chili peppers (tabasco and/or cayenne are the most popular), vinegar and salt. Occasionally xanthan gum or other thickeners are used.
*Louisiana Hot Sauce (450 Scoville Heat Units (SHU) Introduced in 1928, A cayenne pepper based hot sauce produced by Southeastern Mills, Inc., in New Iberia, Louisiana.
*Crystal Hot Sauce (4,000 SHU) is a brand of Louisiana-style hot sauce produced by family-owned Baumer Foods since 1923.
*Tabasco sauce (2,500 SHU) The earliest recognizable brand in the hot sauce industry, first appearing in 1868.
*Frank&#x27;s Red Hot (450 SHU) Claims to be the primary ingredient in the first Buffalo wing sauce.
*Texas Pete (750 SHU) Introduced in 1929, developed and manufactured by the TW Garner Food Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina
*Trappey&#x27;s Hot Sauce Company was founded in 1898. 
*Chili pepper water, used primarily in Hawaii, is ideal for cooking. It is made from whole chilies, garlic, salt, and water. Often homemade, the pungent end product must be sealed carefully to prevent leakage.

===== New Mexico =====
New Mexico chile sauces differ from others in that they contain no vinegar. Almost every traditional New Mexican dish is served with red or green chile sauce, the towns of Hatch, Chimayo, the Albuquerque area, and others in New Mexico are well known for their peppers. The sauce is often added to meats, eggs, vegetables, breads, and some dishes are, in fact, mostly chile sauce with a modest addition of pork, beef, or beans.
*Green chile: This sauce is prepared from any fire roasted green chile peppers are common varieties. The skins are removed and peppers diced. Onions are fried in lard or butter, and a roux is prepared. Broth and chile peppers are added to the roux and thickened. Its consistency is similar to gravy, and it is used as such. It also is used as a salsa.
*Red chile: A roux is made from lard and flour. The dried ground pods of native red chiles are added. Water is added and the sauce is thickened.

===Others===

==== Australia ====
The availability of a wide variety of hot sauces is a relatively recent event in most of Australia. Before 2000, there was little more choice than the flagship brand of Tabasco Cayenne sauce predominantly used in restaurants and sold in supermarkets. Other options included the more specialised thick, medium to hot Asian sauces. Although today, two of the most popular picks are the Buffalo and Sriracha hot sauces. There&#x27;s also very faithful, locally produced versions of Habanero and Trinidad Scorpion ranges available.

==== United Kingdom ====
Two of the hottest chilies in the world, the Naga Viper and Infinity chili were developed in the United Kingdom and are available as sauces which have been claimed to be the hottest natural chili sauces (without added pepper extract) available in the world. The Naga Viper and Infinity were considered the hottest two chili peppers in the world until the Naga Viper was unseated by the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion in late 2011.

==Heat==

The heat, or burning sensation, experienced when consuming hot sauce is caused by capsaicin and related capsaicinoids. The burning sensation is caused by the capsaicin activation of the TRPV1 heat and ligand-gated ion channel in peripheral neurons. The mechanism of action is then a chemical interaction with the neurological system. Although the &quot;burning&quot; sensation does not correspond to a real stimulus, repeated and prolonged use of hot spices may harm the peripheral heat-sensing neurons; this mechanism may explain why frequent spice users become less sensitive to both spices and heat.

Foods containing capsaicin, like hot sauces, can have different effects on each individual. Those with stomach issues can experience worse symptoms than just the “burning” sensation. People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can have gas, diarrhea, or stomach pains after ingesting hot sauces.

The seemingly subjective perceived heat of hot sauces can be measured by the Scoville scale. The Scoville scale number indicates how many times something must be diluted with an equal volume of water until people can no longer feel any sensation from the capsaicin. The hottest hot sauce scientifically possible is one rated at 16 million Scoville units, which is pure capsaicin. An example of a hot sauce marketed as achieving this level of heat is Blair&#x27;s 16 Million Reserve, marketed by Blair&#x27;s Sauces and Snacks. By comparison, Tabasco sauce is rated between 2,500 and 5,000 Scoville units (batches vary) - with one of the mildest commercially available sauces, Cackalacky Classic Sauce Company&#x27;s Spice Sauce, weighing in at less than 1000 Scoville units on the standard heat scale.

===Rating===
A general way to estimate the heat of a sauce is to look at the ingredients list. Sauces tend to vary in heat based on the kind of peppers used, and the further down the list, the less the amount of pepper.
*Cayenne - Sauces made with cayenne, including most of the Louisiana-style sauces, are usually hotter than jalapeño, but milder than other sauces.
*Chile de árbol - A thin and potent Mexican chili pepper also known as bird&#x27;s beak chile and rat&#x27;s tail chile. Their heat index used to be between 15,000 and 30,000 Scoville units, but it can now reach over 100,000 units. In cooking substitutions, the Chile de árbol pepper can be traded with Cayenne pepper.
*Habanero - Habanero pepper sauces were known as the hottest natural pepper sauces, but nowadays species like Bhut jolokia, Naga jolokia or Trinidad Scorpion Moruga are even five or ten-fold hotter.
*Jalapeño - These sauces include green and red jalapeño chilis, and chipotle (ripened and smoked). Green jalapeño and chipotle are usually the mildest sauces available. Red jalapeño sauce is generally hotter.
*Naga Bhut Jolokia - The pepper is also known as Bhut Jolokia, ghost pepper, ghost chili pepper, red naga chilli, and ghost chilli. In 2007, Guinness World Records certified that the Ghost Pepper (Bhut Jolokia) was the world&#x27;s hottest chili pepper, 400 times hotter than Tabasco sauce; however, in 2011 it has since been superseded by the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion.
*Piri piri - The Peri Peri pepper has been naturalized into South Africa and is also known as the African Bird&#x27;s Eye pepper, Piri-Piri pepper or Pili-Pili pepper, depending on what area of the country you&#x27;re in. The pepper ranges from one half to one inch in length and tapers at a blunt point. The small package packs a mighty punch with a 175,000 rating on the Scoville scale, near the Habanero, but the Peri Peri is smaller and has a much different flavor. It is most commonly used in a hot sauce, combined with other spices and seasonings because it has a very light, fresh citrus-herbal flavor that blends well with the flavors of most other ingredients.
*Scotch Bonnet - Similar in heat to the Habanero are these peppers popular in the Caribbean. Often found in Jamaican hot sauces.
*Tabasco peppers - Sauces made with tabasco peppers are generally hotter than cayenne pepper sauces. Along with Tabasco, a number of sauces are made using tabasco peppers.
*Trinidad Moruga Scorpion The golf ball-sized chili pepper has a tender fruit-like flavor. According to the New Mexico State University Chile Institute, the Trinidad Scorpion Moruga Blend ranks as high as 2,009,231 SHU on the Scoville scale.
*Carolina Reaper - The Carolina Reaper is a super hot pepper which has been described as a roasted sweetness delivering an instant level of heat. Developed by Puckerbutt Founder Ed Currie in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the Carolina Reaper averages over 1.6 million SHU and was awarded the Guinness World Record in August 2017.
*Capsaicin extract - The hottest sauces are made from capsaicin extract. These range from extremely hot pepper sauce blends to pure capsaicin extracts. These sauces are extremely hot and should be considered with caution by those not used to fiery foods. Many are too hot to consume more than a drop or two in a pot of food. These novelty sauces are typically only sold by specialty retailers and are usually more expensive.
*Other ingredients - heat is also affected by other ingredients. Mustard oil and wasabi can be added to increase the sensation of heat but generally, more ingredients in a sauce dilute the effect of the chilis, resulting in a milder flavor. Many sauces contain tomatoes, carrots, onions, garlic or other vegetables and seasonings. Vinegar or lemon juice are also common ingredients in many hot sauces because their acidity will help keep the sauce from oxidizing, thus acting as a preservative.

== Remedies ==
Capsaicinoids are the chemicals responsible for the &quot;hot&quot; taste of chili peppers. They are fat soluble and therefore water will be of no assistance when countering the burn. The most effective way to relieve the burning sensation is with dairy products, such as milk and yogurt. A protein called casein occurs in dairy products which binds to the capsaicin, effectively making it less available to &quot;burn&quot; the mouth, and the milk fat helps keep it in suspension. Rice is also useful for mitigating the impact, especially when it is included with a mouthful of the hot food. These foods are typically included in the cuisine of cultures that specialise in the use of chilis. Mechanical stimulation of the mouth by chewing food will also partially mask the pain sensation.

<text>Brigadier Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey, VC, MC (1 September 1888 – 24 August 1980) was an Irish-born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, Canadian soldier and rugby union player. During the First World War, while serving in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the Military Cross and the French Croix de Guerre.

==Military career==
Educated at Portora Royal School and Ellesmere College, Harvey first arrived in Canada in 1908 where he worked as a surveyor in northern Alberta and High River. On 18 May 1916 he enlisted in the 13th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, at Medicine Hat, Alberta. He was subsequently commissioned as a lieutenant and posted to the Western Front in 1916. He then transferred to Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse, part of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. Harvey was awarded the Victoria Cross following an incident on 27 March 1917 at the village of Guyencourt.

Harvey was originally awarded the Distinguished Service Order but this was later upgraded to a VC. In March 1918, Harvey was also awarded the Military Cross for the same action that earned Lieutenant Gordon Flowerdew the VC.

After the war Harvey remained with Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse and was promoted to captain in 1923. He then served as the Instructor in Physical Training at the Royal Military College of Canada from 1923 to 1927. In 1938, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became the commanding officer of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse. In 1939, he was made a brigadier and commander of Military District 13.

== Sporting career ==
Harvey made two senior appearances for Ireland. He played in the 1907 Home Nations Championship against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, losing 29–0. His teammates on the day included James Cecil Parke and Basil Maclear. He played for Ireland for the second and last time in the 1911 Five Nations Championship at the Mardyke, winning 25–5 against France.

Harvey played rugby for both Wanderers and Ireland. He is one of three Ireland rugby union internationals to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The other two are Thomas Crean and Robert Johnston, who both served in the Second Boer War. Like Harvey, Crean and Johnston also played for Wanderers. His two brothers Arnold and Duncan were also notable sportsmen. Both also represented Ireland at rugby, while Arnold also represented Ireland at cricket and athletics.

==Later years==
Harvey retired in December 1945, but maintained an active interest in horses as a judge of hunter and jumper competitions. He also served as Honorary Colonel of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse from 1958 to 1966.

He died aged 91 years and was buried at Union Cemetery in Fort Macleod, Alberta.

In 2019, his story along with other Wanderers Victoria Cross recipients Robert Johnston and Thomas Crean was told in a documentary entitled &quot;Mark Our Place&quot; directed and produced by Ashley Morrison.

<text>Ralph Albert Blakelock (October 15, 1847 – August 9, 1919) was a romanticist American painter known primarily for his landscape paintings related to the Tonalism movement.
==Biography==
Ralph Blakelock was born in New York City on October 15, 1847, the son of Caroline Olinarg (Carry) and Ralph B. Blakelock, who was born in England. His father was a successful physician. Blakelock initially set out to follow in his footsteps, and in 1864 began studies at the Free Academy of the City of New York (now known as the City College). He dropped out after his third term, opting to forgo formal education. From 1869 to 1872 he traveled alone through the American West, wandering far from American settlements and spending time among the American Indians. Largely self-taught as an artist, he began producing competent landscapes, as well as scenes of Indian life, based on his notebooks he filled while traveling and on his personal memories and feelings. Blakelock&#x27;s works were exhibited in the National Academy of Design.

In 1877 Blakelock married Cora Rebecca Bailey; they had nine children. In art, Blakelock was a genius, yet, in business dealings and in monetary transactions he proved a failure. He found it difficult, if not crushing to maintain and support his wife and children. In desperation he found himself selling his paintings for extremely low prices, far beneath their known worth. In hopes of lifting his family from abject poverty, reportedly on the day his 9th child was born, Blakelock had offered a painting to a collector for $1000. The collector made a counter offer and after refusing the proposed sum Blakelock found himself in a bitter argument with his wife. After the domestic dispute, Blakelock returned to the patron and sold the painting for a much lesser sum. Defeated and frustrated, it is said he broke down and tore the cash into pieces. And so it was after such repeated failed business transactions that he began to suffer from extreme depression and eventually show symptoms of mental frailty.
Blakelock suffered his first mental breakdown in 1891, while living with his brother in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For financial assistance, he began selling his paintings, including 30 to 40 to vaudeville performer Lew Bloom between 1889 and 1892. His depression manifested in schizophrenic delusions in which he believed himself immensely wealthy – perhaps a compensation for his long struggle to provide for his family. In 1899, he suffered his final breakdown and spent almost the entire remaining twenty years of his life in mental institutions.

Almost as soon as Blakelock went into the first psychiatric hospital, his works began to receive recognition. Within a few years the paintings he had once sold for next to nothing were resold for several thousand dollars. In 1916, Blakelock was made an Academician of the National Academy of Design. Meanwhile, Blakelock languished in the mental asylum of Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital, whose administration and staff were unaware of his fame as an artist, and who viewed his belief that his paintings were in major museums as one more sign of his illness. While confined he continued to paint in ink, painting on the backs of cardboard and various supports, substituting bark and his own hair for brushes.

In 1916, one of Blakelock&#x27;s landscapes sold at auction for $20,000, setting a record for a painting by a living American artist. It was this impressive price that captured the imagination of Sadie Filbert, who had reinvented herself as the socially prominent Beatrice Van Rensselaer Adams so that she could swindle the wealthy by persuading them to donate to charitable causes that would, in fact, serve to enrich herself. She founded and milked the Blakelock Fund, which was supposed to support the impecunious artist and his needy brood. She informed Harrison Smith, then a young reporter with the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, of Blakelock&#x27;s whereabouts, and he went to see Blakelock in the asylum. He found him largely lucid, although under the delusion that an imagined &quot;diamond of the Emperor of Brazil&quot; had been stolen from him. Smith explained to the asylum director who Blakelock was, and managed to arrange to bring Blakelock and the director to Manhattan, where a major gallery retrospective of Blakelock&#x27;s work was taking place. Blakelock was awed by the changes in the city in the two decades since he had last seen it, and thrilled to see the recognition his work had received. Smith scored himself a major news story. (In a 1945 account, Smith added that Blakelock had quietly informed him that several of the paintings were forgeries, but Smith chose not to put that in his story because of the question of how far he could rely on the word of the less than fully sane Blakelock.) These events led to Blakelock&#x27;s release from the asylum, in the &quot;care&quot; of Sadie Filbert, alias Beatrice Van Rensselaer Adams, who milked him for all he was worth.

He continued painting until his death at the age of 71 on August 9, 1919.

==Work==

Blakelock taught himself to paint through trial and error, and continued to use improvisation as an artistic method throughout his life. He was also an accomplished musician, and would use his improvised piano compositions as inspiration for his paintings. He would work on paintings for years, building layers and then scoring, scraping, or rubbing them away.

Blakelock&#x27;s early landscapes have their genesis in the style of the Hudson River School of painters. In time, he developed a more subjective and intimate style. His favorite themes were those depicting the wilderness and solitude; evocative and emotional paintings of illuminated moments in nature, of moonlight landscapes and twilight hours and Indian camps in the solitude of nature. He was also heavily influenced by the French Barbizon School, whose painters also favored dark forests and heavily worked surfaces. Blakelock&#x27;s technique was highly personal and through his individualistic style his paintings summoned the viewer into a luminous, almost other worldly realm. In the majority of his paintings, space is given depth by the use of light; moonlight most often. Along with his contemporary Albert Pinkham Ryder, Ralph Albert Blakelock was one of the most individual American painters of his time.

One of his many paintings entitled &quot;Moonlight&quot; was sold at the highest price ever paid for the work of a living American artist at that time. Sadly, his growing fame along with the rising sums his work commanded never benefited his family or himself. By 1903 his works were being forged, so much so, that he remains today as &quot;perhaps the most forged&quot; artist in America. Such was the final ironic touch to one of the most tragic stories in American art.
==Friendship with Harry Watrous==
Around or after 1886, Blakelock was befriended by the younger painter Harry Watrous, and often used his studio in the Sherwood Studio Building. &quot;Over the years, when Blakelock was in financial need, Watrous handled his work for him, selling it to art dealers and collectors, something Blakelock often could not manage for himself.&quot; Watrous was Blakelock&#x27;s &quot;most faithful supporter, both during the productive decades of the 1880s and 1890s and during the period of his confinement&quot; for mental illness. Around and after the time of Blakelock&#x27;s death, Watrous began painting landscapes and nocturnes which &quot;in their evocative mood, boldly designed compositions, and use of light and dark contrasts…resemble the work of his friend Blakelock,&quot; and may be seen as elegiac tributes. Some anecdotes about Watrous and Blakelock are related in &quot;American Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Vol. III&quot;.
==In popular culture==
Blakelock is a key figure in the setting of Paul Auster&#x27;s novel &quot;Moon Palace&quot;. In particular, one of his many &quot;Moonlight&quot; paintings, specifically the 1885 painting (68.7 by 81.3 cm) in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum (see picture in Artworks section below), is referred to in the novel.

Blakelock&#x27;s paintings are a key plot point in the 2020 movie &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking of Ending Things&quot;.

<doc id="1223534" wikidata="Q2517561" url="?curid=1223534" title="Rettig Report">
<text>The Rettig Report, officially The National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Report, is a 1991 report by a commission designated by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin (from the &quot;Concertación&quot;) detailing human rights abuses resulting in deaths or disappearances that occurred in Chile during the years of military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, which began on September 11, 1973 and ended on March 11, 1990. The report found that over 2,000 people had been killed for political reasons, and dozens of military personnel have been convicted of human rights abuses. In addition, many reforms have been made based on the recommendations of the report including an official reparations department.

== Background ==
The National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation, the eight-member committee that later wrote the Rettig Report, was set up shortly after Patricio Aylwin, Chile&#x27;s first democratically elected president since Salvador Allende, took office following the 1989 election. In addition to the eight members, the committee was chaired by Raúl Rettig, a former Chilean senator and ambassador to Brazil under Allende. In order to show impartiality, the commission contained four members each from camps of supporters of the Pinochet regime, and opponents of it.

The eight-members of the commission were Jaime Castillo Velasco, José Luis Cea Egaña, Mónica Jiménez, Laura Novoa Vásquez, José Zalaquett Daher, Ricardo Martin Díaz, and Gonzalo Vial Correa (minister of Education 1978-79).

The commission was given large amounts of resources and access to official documents to ensure thoroughness, and the report was finalized in February 1991. One criticism of the report is that it only focused on politically motivated murders and disappearances that occurred while Pinochet was dictator, and did not include other human rights violations. This issue was addressed in a second report commissioned in 2003 known as the Valech Report.

== Goals of the Report ==
On April 25, 1990, Aylwin issued Supreme Decree No. 355, officially creating the National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation with the following goals:

* To create as complete a picture as possible of the most serious human rights violations
* To gather evidence to allow the creation of a list that identifies the victims&#x27; name, fate, and whereabouts
* To recommend reparations for the families of victims 
* To recommend legal and administrative measures to prevent future violations

== Findings ==

The report determined that there were 2,115 victims of human rights violations and 164 victims of political violence between September 11, 1973 and the end of the Pinochet regime on March 11, 1990. This breaks down further to 1,068 victims confirmed to have been killed, 957 people who disappeared after their arrest, and an additional 90 killed by politically motivated private citizens. The report also was unable to come to a decision for 614 cases, and there were an additional 508 cases in which the nature of the violation did not fit the commission&#x27;s mandate. The commission found that the majority of the human rights violations were conducted in a sophisticated and systematic fashion in the years directly after Pinochet took power. The majority of the violations were perpetrated by the National Intelligence Directorate (DINA), Chile&#x27;s secret police force from 1973 to 1977.

== Legal Ramifications ==
As of May 2012, 76 agents had been condemned for violations of human rights and 67 were convicted: 36 in the Army, 27 in the Carabineros, 2 in the Air Force, one of the Navy and one in the Police. Three condemned agents died and six agents got conditional sentences. 350 cases, pertaining to disappeared persons, illegal detainees and torture, remain open. There are 700 military and civilian persons involved in these cases. While some perpetrators have been convicted, prosecution has been difficult due to an amnesty law passed by the military regime in 1978 giving full legal protection to any individual implicated in human rights violations between 1973 and 1978.

== Recommendations ==
The report included the following recommendations to prevent future human rights violations in Chile:
* Ratification of international human rights treaties
* Modifying the national laws to match international standards of human rights law
* Assuring the independence of the judiciary
* Creating a society in which the armed forces, the police, and the security forces respect human rights
* Creating a permanent office to work to protect citizens from future human rights violations

Over time, many of these recommendations were put into place in Chile, although progress was slow due to a lack of a legislative majority from Aylwin&#x27;s party, and the continued influence of the military in politics. One area where Aylwin was unable to make change was a failure to repeal the 1978 amnesty law.

== Aftermath ==
In a speech announcing the report&#x27;s findings, President Aylwin apologized on behalf of the Chilean government for the murders and disappearances detailed in the report, and asked the military to do the same. The Chilean military, still headed at the time by Pinochet, refused to apologize and much of the armed forces community openly questioned the validity of the report.

The Rettig Report&#x27;s listing of a disappeared person as deceased and the victim of a human rights violation created a legal determination of the victim&#x27;s situation. That would give the surviving family members certain benefits such as making it possible for them to resolve property and inheritance claims, apply for social security and any reparation benefits, as well as impacting the marital status of spouses. This was made possible through the establishment of the &quot;National Corporation for Reparation and Reconciliation&quot;.

Other actions based on recommendations from the report that were eventually taken by later Chilean governments are:

* The elimination in 1998 of the national holiday celebrating the 1973 coup.
* The Chilean military was stripped of its political power with the elimination of the military dominated National Security Council in 2005.
*The National Institute for Human Rights, a government agency that reports on human rights issues within Chile, was created in November 2009.

Pinochet was also stripped of his parliamentary immunity in 2000, and was indicted by the Chilean Supreme Court along with other officers for killings which occurred after the original coup in 1973. He was put under house arrest with new charges in 2004, and died under house arrest in December 2006.

The human rights violations in Chile were also looked at again in the Valech Report which was conducted between 2004 and 2005.

<text>Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a hereditary predisposition to colon cancer.

HNPCC includes (and was once synonymous with) Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic condition that is associated with a high risk of colon cancer, endometrial cancer (second most common), ovary, stomach, small intestine, hepatobiliary tract, upper urinary tract, brain, and skin. The increased risk for these cancers is due to inherited genetic mutations that impair DNA mismatch repair. It is a type of cancer syndrome.

Other HNPCC conditions include Lynch-like syndrome, polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis and familial colorectal cancer type X.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Risk of cancer===
Lifetime risk and mean age at diagnosis for Lynch syndrome–associated cancers

In addition to the types of cancer found in the chart above, it is understood that Lynch syndrome also contributes to an increased risk of small bowel cancer, pancreatic cancer, ureter/renal pelvis cancer, biliary tract cancer, brain cancer, and sebaceous neoplasms. Increased risk of prostate cancer and breast cancer has also been associated with Lynch syndrome, although this relationship is not entirely understood.

Two-thirds of colon cancers occur in the proximal colon and common signs and symptoms include blood in the stool, diarrhea or constipation, and unintended weight loss. The mean age of colorectal cancer diagnosis is 44 for members of families that meet the Amsterdam criteria. The average age of diagnosis of endometrial cancer is about 46 years. Among women with HNPCC who have both colon and endometrial cancer, about half present first with endometrial cancer, making endometrial cancer the most common sentinel cancer in Lynch syndrome. The most common symptom of endometrial cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding. In HNPCC, the mean age of diagnosis of gastric cancer is 56 years of age with intestinal-type adenocarcinoma being the most commonly reported pathology. HNPCC-associated ovarian cancers have an average age of diagnosis of 42.5 years old; approximately 30% are diagnosed before age 40.

Significant variation in the rate of cancer has been found depending on the mutation involved. Up to the age of 75 years the risks of different cancers by the mutations are in the table below.

==Genetics==
Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The hallmark of Lynch syndrome is defective DNA mismatch repair, which causes an elevated rate of single nucleotide changes and microsatellite instability, also known as MSI-H (the H is &quot;high&quot;). MSI is identifiable in cancer specimens in the pathology laboratory. Most cases result in changes in the lengths of dinucleotide repeats of the nucleobases cytosine and adenine (sequence: CACACACACA...).

The 4 main genes involved in Lynch syndrome normally encode for proteins that form dimers to function:

# MLH1 protein dimerizes with PMS2 protein to form MutLα, which coordinates the binding of other proteins involved with mismatch repair like DNA helicase, single-stranded-DNA binding-protein (RPA), and DNA polymerases.
# MSH2 protein dimerizes with MSH6 protein, which identifies mismatches via a sliding clamp model, a protein for scanning for errors.

The impairment of either gene for the protein dimer impairs the protein function. These 4 genes are involved in error correction (mismatch repair), so dysfunction of the genes can lead to the inability to fix DNA replication errors and cause Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is known to be associated with other mutations in genes involved in the DNA mismatch repair pathway:
People with &quot;MSH6&quot; mutations are more likely to be Amsterdam criteria II-negative. The presentation with MSH6 is slightly different from with MLH1 and MSH2, and the term &quot;MSH6 syndrome&quot; has been used to describe this condition. In one study, the Bethesda guidelines were more sensitive than the Amsterdam Criteria in detecting it.

Up to 39% of families with mutations in a Lynch syndrome gene do not meet the Amsterdam criteria. Therefore, families found to have a deleterious mutation in a Lynch syndrome gene should be considered to have Lynch syndrome regardless of the extent of the family history. This also means that the Amsterdam criteria fail to identify many people who are at risk for Lynch syndrome. Improving the criteria for screening is an active area of research, as detailed in the Screening Strategies section of this article.

Most people with Lynch syndrome inherit the condition from a parent. However, due to incomplete penetrance, variable age of cancer diagnosis, cancer risk reduction, or early death, not all people with a Lynch syndrome gene mutation have a parent who had cancer. Some people develop HNPCC de-novo in a new generation, without inheriting the gene. These people are often only identified after developing early-life colon cancer. Parents with HNPCC have a 50% chance of passing the genetic mutation on to each child. It is also important to note, that deleterious mutation in one of MMR genes alone is not sufficient to cause cancer, but that rather further mutations in other tumour suppressor genes need to occur.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is applied to people with a germline DNA mutation in one of the MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) or the EPCAM gene, identified by genetic testing. Candidates for germline genetic testing can be identified by clinical criteria such as the Amsterdam Clinical Criteria and Bethesda Guidelines, or through tumor analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. In the US, professional societies recommend testing every colon cancer for MSI or IHC as screening for Lynch syndrome, but this is not always performed because of cost and resource limitations. Genetic testing is commercially available and consists of a blood test.

=== Immunohistochemistry ===
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a method that can be used to detect abnormal mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression in tumours that are associated with Lynch syndrome. While it is not diagnostic of a Lynch syndrome, it can play a role in identifying people who should have germline testing. Two methods of implementation of IHC testing includes age-based testing and universal testing for all people. Currently, there is no widespread agreement regarding which screening method should be used. Age-based testing for IHC has been suggested in part due to cost-benefit analyses, whereas universal testing for all people with colorectal cancer ensures people with Lynch Syndrome are not missed. To address the costs, researchers are trying to predict MSI or IHC directly from the way the tumor looks under the microscope, without doing any molecular testing.

=== Microsatellite instability ===
Mutations in DNA mismatch repair systems can lead to difficulty transmitting regions within the DNA which contain repeating patterns of two or three nucleotides (microsatellites), otherwise known as microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI is associated with alternate sized repetitive DNA sequences that are not present in the correlated germ line DNA resulting in 15-20% of colorectal cancers. MSI is identified through DNA extraction from both a tumor tissue sample and a normal tissue sample followed by PCR analysis of microsatellite regions. MSI analysis can be used to identify people who may have Lynch syndrome and direct them for further testing. One study noted that one-third of MSI colorectal cancers showed a low immunoscore, suggesting that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes might be a good option for therapy for these patients. High numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were related to better survival rates and treatment responses.

===Classification===
Three major groups of MSI-H (microsatellite instability – MSI) cancers can be recognized by histopathological criteria:
* right-sided poorly differentiated cancers
* right-sided mucinous cancers
* adenocarcinomas in any location showing any measurable level of intraepithelial lymphocyte (TIL)

The histopathological criteria are not sensitive enough to detect MSI from histology but researchers are trying to use artificial intelligence to predict MSI from histology.

In addition, HNPCC can be divided into &quot;Lynch syndrome I&quot; (familial colon cancer) and &quot;Lynch syndrome II&quot; (HNPCC associated with other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract or reproductive system).

===Screening===
Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families that meet the Amsterdam criteria, preferably before the onset of colon cancer.

Colon cancer

Colonoscopies are recommended as a preventative method of surveillance for individuals who have Lynch syndrome, or LS-associated genes. Specifically, it is recommended that colonoscopies begin at ages 20–25 for MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers and 35 years for MSH6 and PMS2 mutation carriers. Colonoscopic surveillance should then be performed at a 1-2 year interval for Lynch Syndrome patients.

Endometrial/ovarian cancer

A transvaginal ultrasound with or without endometrial biopsy is recommended annually for ovarian and endometrial cancer screening. For women with Lynch syndrome, a yearly CA-125 blood test can be used to screen for ovarian cancer, however there is limited data on the efficacy of this test in reducing mortality.

Other cancers

There are also strategies for detecting other cancers early or reducing the chances of developing them that people with Lynch syndrome can discuss with their doctor, however, their effectiveness is not clear. These options include:
* Upper endoscopies to detect stomach and small bowel cancer every 3–5 years, starting at age 30 at the earliest (preferably in a research setting)
* Annual urinalysis to detect bladder cancer, starting at age 30 at the earliest (preferably in a research setting)
* Annual physical and neurological exams to detect cancer in the central nervous system (brain or spinal cord), starting at age 25 at the earliest

====Amsterdam criteria====
The following are the Amsterdam criteria in identifying high-risk candidates for molecular genetic testing:

&quot;Amsterdam I Criteria (all bullet points must be fulfilled): The Amsterdam I criteria were published in 1990; however, were felt to be insufficiently sensitive.&quot;
* Three or more family members with a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer, one of whom is a first-degree (parent, child, sibling) relative of the other two
* Two successive affected generations
* One or more colon cancers diagnosed under the age of 50 years
* Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has been excluded

The Amsterdam II criteria were developed in 1999 and improved the diagnostic sensitivity for Lynch syndrome by including cancers of the endometrium, small bowel, ureter, and renal pelvis.

&quot;Amsterdam Criteria II (all bullet points must be fulfilled):&quot;
* Three or more family members with HNPCC-related cancers, one of whom is a first-degree relative of the other two
* Two successive affected generations
* One or more of the HNPCC-related cancers diagnosed under the age of 50 years
* Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has been excluded

The Bethesda criteria were developed in 1997 and later updated in 2004 by the National Cancer Institute to identify persons requiring further testing for Lynch syndrome through MSI. In contrast to the Amsterdam Criteria, the Revised Bethesda Guidelines use pathological data in addition to clinical information to help healthcare providers identify persons at high risk.

Revised Bethesda Guidelines

If a person meets any 1 of 5 criteria the tumour(s) from the person should be tested for MSI:

# Colorectal cancer diagnosed before age 50
# Presence of synchronous or metachronous colorectal or other Lynch syndrome-associated cancers (e.g. cancers of the endometrium, ovary, stomach, small bowel, pancreas, biliary tract, ureter, renal pelvis, brain, sebaceous glands, keratoacanthomas)
# Colorectal cancer with MSI-high pathology in a person who is younger than 60 years of age
# Colorectal cancer diagnosed in a person with one or more first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome-associated tumour diagnosed under the age of 50
# Person with colorectal cancer and two or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome-associated cancer diagnosed at any age.

It is important to note that these clinical criteria can be difficult to use in practice and clinical criteria used alone misses between 12 and 68 percent of Lynch syndrome cases.

=== Surgery ===
Prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries to prevent cancer from developing) can be performed before ovarian or endometrial cancer develops.

==Treatment==
Surgery remains the front-line therapy for Lynch syndrome. Patients with Lynch syndrome who develop colorectal cancer may be treated with either a partial colectomy or total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. Due to the increased risk of colorectal cancer following partial colectomy and similar quality of life after both surgeries, a total colectomy may be a preferred treatment for Lynch syndrome, especially in younger patients.

There is an ongoing controversy over the benefit of 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant therapies for Lynch syndrome-related colorectal tumours, particularly those in stages I and II.
* Anti-PD-1 antibody therapy can be effective.

Checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 therapy is now the preferred first-line therapy for advanced Microsatellite-Instability–High colorectal cancer.

== Research ==
In 2024 development for a vaccine called LynchVax that would reduce the risk of cancer from the disease has been started by scientists from the University of Oxford with a grant from Cancer Research UK but clinical trials are far from being conducted yet.

==Epidemiology==
Though the exact prevalence of Lynch syndrome-causing mutations in the general population remains unknown, recent studies estimate the prevalence to be 1 in 279 individuals, or 0.35%. Certain populations are known to have a higher prevalence of founder mutations, including, but not limited to, French Canadians, Icelanders, African Americans, and Ashkenazi Jews. Lynch syndrome-causing mutations are found in approximately 3% of all diagnosed colorectal cancers, and 1.8% of all diagnosed endometrial cancers. The average age of diagnosis of cancer in patients with this syndrome is 44 years old, as compared to 64 years old in people without the syndrome.

==Terminology==
Henry T. Lynch, Professor of Medicine at Creighton University Medical Center, characterized the syndrome in 1966. In his earlier work, he described the disease entity as &quot;cancer family syndrome.&quot; The term &quot;Lynch syndrome&quot; was coined in 1984 by other authors; Lynch named the condition HNPCC in 1985. Since then the two terms have been used interchangeably until later advances in the understanding of the genetics of the disease led to the term HNPCC falling out of favor.

Other sources reserve the term &quot;Lynch syndrome&quot; when there is a known DNA mismatch repair defect, and use the term &quot;familial colorectal cancer type X&quot; when the Amsterdam criteria are met but there is no known DNA mismatch repair defect. The putative &quot;type X&quot; families appear to have a lower overall incidence of cancer and lower risk for non-colorectal cancers than families with documented DNA mismatch repair deficiency. About 35% of people who meet Amsterdam criteria do not have a DNA-mismatch-repair gene mutation.

Complicating matters is the presence of an alternative set of criteria, known as the &quot;Bethesda Guidelines.&quot;

==Society==
There are a number of non-profit organisations providing information and support, including Lynch Syndrome International, AliveAndKickn, Lynch Syndrome UK and Bowel Cancer UK. In the US, National Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day is March 22.

<text>Frank Alexander de Pass, VC (26 April 1887 – 25 November 1914) was an officer in the British Indian Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first Jew to receive the VC.

==Early life and family==

De Pass was born in Kensington to London merchant Sir Eliot de Pass and Beatrice de Mercado. The family&#x27;s original surname, Shalom, was translated to the Spanish word for peace and became &quot;Paz&quot; before being anglicised to Pass when the family first settled in England in the 1660s. De Pass attended Rugby School.

His sister, Marjorie, married Sir Henry Kitson and had two sons, including Sir Frank Kitson.

==First World War==
By the age of 27, De Pass had attained the rank of lieutenant in the 34th Prince Albert Victor&#x27;s Own Poona Horse.

On 24 November 1914, de Pass entered a German sap near Festubert, France, and destroyed a traverse in the face of the enemy&#x27;s bombs. He also rescued, under heavy fire, a wounded man who was lying exposed to enemy bullets in the open. The next day, de Pass was killed in a second attempt to capture the sap, which the enemy had re-occupied. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross on 18 February 1915. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London. The full citation for the award reads as follows:

In 2014, on the centennial of his death, de Pass was honoured with a memorial paving stone laid outside the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall, London. The ceremony was attended by his nephew, Colonel Jonny Kitson, his great nephew Thomas Kitson and Victoria Cross recipient Sergeant Johnson Beharry.

<doc id="1223546" wikidata="Q3473024" url="?curid=1223546" title="Community health">
<text>Community health refers to non-treatment based health services that are delivered outside hospitals and clinics. Community health is a subset of public health that is taught to and practiced by clinicians as part of their normal duties. Community health volunteers and community health workers work with primary care providers to facilitate entry into, exit from and utilization of the formal health system by community members as well as providing supplementary services such as support groups or wellness events that are not offered by medical institutions.

Community health is a major field of study within the medical and clinical sciences which focuses on the maintenance, protection, and improvement of the health status of population groups and communities, in particular those who are a part of disadvantaged communities. It is a distinct field of study that may be taught within a separate school of public health or preventive healthcare. The World Health Organization defines community health as:Environmental, Social, and Economic resources to sustain emotional and physical well being among people in ways that advance their aspirations and satisfy their needs in their unique environment.

Medical interventions that occur in communities can be classified as three categories: Primary care, Secondary care, and Tertiary care. Each category focuses on a different level and approach towards the community or population group. In the United States, Community health is rooted within Primary healthcare achievements. Primary healthcare programs aim to reduce risk factors and increase health promotion and prevention. Secondary healthcare is related to &quot;hospital care&quot; where acute care is administered in a hospital department setting. Tertiary healthcare refers to highly specialized care usually involving disease or disability management.

Community health services are classified into categories including:
# Preventive health services such as chemoprophylaxis for Tuberculosis, Cancer screening and treatment of Diabetes and Hypertension.
# Promotive health services such as health education,  family planning, vaccination and nutritional supplementation
# Curative health services such as treatment of Jiggers, Lice infestation, Malaria and Pneumonia.
# Rehabilitative health services such as provision of prosthetics, social work, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling and other mental health services.

== Community health workers and volunteers ==
Community health workers (also known as community health assistants and community health officers) are local public health workers with a deep understanding of their community&#x27;s health needs and challenges. They serve as a bridge between their community and local health systems to ensure high quality and culturally competent service delivery. They have vocational, professional or academic qualifications which enable them to provide training, supervisory, administrative, teaching and research services in community health departments.

Community health volunteers are members of a local community who have experience and training on the health problems prevalent in their community and care services available, in order to identify and link those in need with local providers. Community health volunteers may be referred to by different titles depending on their local health system; these titles can included lay health workers, health volunteers, village health agents, non-specialist healthcare providers, and village health agents.

Community health volunteers provide basic services such as distribution of water chlorination tablets, mosquito nets and health education material. They will involve or work with registered clinicians when they encounter sick or recovering patients or those with complex or ongoing needs.

Community health organizations are non-profit and non government organization which administers and coordinates the delivery of health care services to people living in a designated community or neighborhood. It helps people understand their status of health or social conditions. Providing advocacy for those who need it and holding groups and individual meetings with people in the community. The vital role is advocating for the rights and interests of their community members. They raise awareness about issues affecting their community by research, dialogues and lobby for policies and programs that address those issues.

== Measuring Community health ==
Community health is generally measured by Geographical Information Systems and Demographic data. Geographic Information Systems can be used to define sub-communities when neighborhood location data is not enough. Traditionally Community health has been measured using sampling data which was then compared to well-known data sets, like the National Health Interview Survey or National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. With technological development, information systems could store more data for small-scale communities, cities, and towns; as opposed to census data that only generalize information about small populations based on the overall population. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can give more precise information about community resources, even at neighborhood levels. The ease of use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), advances in multilevel statistics, and spatial analysis methods make it easier for researchers to procure and generate data related to the built environment.

Social media can also play a big role in health information analytics. Studies have found social media being capable of influencing people to change their unhealthy behaviors and encourage interventions capable of improving health status. Social media statistics combined with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) may provide researchers with a more complete image of community standards for health and well being.

== Categories of Community health ==

=== Primary Healthcare and Primary Prevention ===

Community-based health promotion emphasizes Primary Prevention and population-based perspective (traditional prevention). It is the goal of Community Health to have individuals in a certain community improve their lifestyle or seek medical attention. Primary Healthcare is provided by health professionals, specifically the ones a patient sees first that may refer them to Secondary or Tertiary care.

Primary prevention refers to the early avoidance and identification of risk factors that may lead to certain diseases and disabilities. Community-focused efforts including immunizations, classroom teaching, and awareness campaigns are all good examples of how primary prevention techniques are utilized by communities to change certain health behaviors. Prevention programs, if carefully designed and drafted, can effectively prevent problems that children and adolescents face as they grow up. This finding also applies to all groups and classes of people. Prevention programs are one of the most effective tools health professionals can use to significantly impact individual, population, and community health.

=== Secondary Healthcare and Secondary Prevention ===
Community health can also be improved with improvements in individuals&#x27; environments. Community health status is determined by the environmental characteristics, behavioral characteristics, social cohesion in the environment of that community. Appropriate modifications in the environment can help to prevent unhealthy behaviors and negative health outcomes.

Secondary prevention refers to improvements made in a patient&#x27;s lifestyle or environment after the onset of disease or disability. This sort of prevention works to make life easier for the patient since it is too late to prevent them from their current disease or disability. An example of secondary prevention is when those with occupational low back pain are provided with strategies to stop their health status from worsening; the prospects of secondary prevention may even hold more promise than primary prevention in this case.

=== Tertiary Healthcare ===
In Tertiary healthcare, community health can only be affected with professional medical care involving the entire population. Patients need to be referred to specialists and undergo advanced medical treatment. In some countries, there are more sub-specialties of medical professions than there are primary care specialists. Health inequalities are directly related to social advantage and social resources.
== Challenges and difficulties in Community health ==

The complexity of community health and its various problems can make it difficult for researchers to assess and identify solutions. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is a unique alternative that combines community participation, inquiry, and action. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) helps researchers address community issues with a broader lens and also works with the people in the community to find culturally sensitive, valid, and reliable methods and approaches.

Community health also requires clear communication to properly address health issues, disparities, and complications. Health communication is the concept that applies communication evidence, strategy, theory, and creativity to promote behaviors, policies, and practices that advance the health and well-being of people and populations. Communicating health care can be limited by a few factors, which are important to recognize to best apply community health practices. To better understand and provide community health from a provider and consumer perspective, limitations in concepts such as scientific complexity or uncertainty. When using an example such as environmental health, scientific complexity can be summarized with environmental health risks that often involve complex scientific concepts that can be difficult to understand for someone without the technical knowledge gained from specialized training or education. The use of plain language and visual aids helps to simplify complex information and increase accessibility. Uncertainty in community health exists when the scientific understanding of environmental health risks may be incomplete or uncertain. Knowing details about how communities work, specific to the individual, can also play a role in a better understanding as well as offering complete transparency about the limitations of knowledge and ongoing research efforts. Preventative actions must be taken to prevent misinformation in the face of uncertainty as it can cause grave circumstances as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scientific complexity and uncertainty are concepts that can make it difficult to understand the environment and limits coherent communication about population health. Examples of successful community health initiatives can include projects addressing the issues that complicate the subject. For example, promotions for understanding, as well as initiatives working towards already acknowledged health issues in each community.

Patients with limited-English proficiency especially struggle to access health and turn to community health centers. Community health carries the burden of serving such patients. There is a need to invest more in the interpreter workforce (in both quantity and quality), letting those with limited-English proficiency know more about their rights currently available to them, potential legal avenues to take if said rights are not being provided, and increased awareness for non-verbal communication. Executive Order 13166 (2000), titled Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, offered continuing education for health professionals, certification of healthcare interpreters, and reimbursement for language services for Medicaid/ State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) enrollees in order to address the institutional issues regarding language barriers in our current healthcare system. Another avenue that has been taken is local governments partnering with community-based organizations, such as the collaboration between Alameda county and the Korean Community Center of the East Bay (KCCEB) to create RICE, the Refugee and Immigrant Collaborative for Empowerment, a coalition mobilized by various multiethnic and multilingual organizations. They partnered in 2020 during the height of the pandemic in order to support COVID-19 testing and increase vaccine awareness and accessibility across 16 language groups.

Other issues involve access and cost of medical care. A great majority of the world does not have adequate health insurance. In low-income countries, less than 40% of total health expenditures are paid for by the governments.

In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed the way community health centers operate and the policies that were in place, greatly influencing community health. The ACA directly affected community health centers by increasing funding, expanding insurance coverage for Medicaid, reforming the Medicaid payment system, appropriating $1.5 billion to increase the workforce and promote training. The impact, importance, and success of the Affordable Care Act is still being studied and will have a large impact on how ensuring health can affect community standards on health and also individual health.

Ethnic disparities in health statuses among different communities are also a cause of concern. Community coalition-driven interventions may bring benefits to this segment of society. This also relates to language usage, where results from a 2019 systematic review found that patients with limited English proficiency who received care from physicians who communicate in the patient&#x27;s own preferred language generally had improved health outcomes.

== Community health resolutions ==
Each community is different and should create its own Community Health Improvement Process (CHIP). CHIP consists of problem identification and prioritization cycle along with an analysis and implementation cycle. Five strategies that assist the CHIP process are improving community health and well-being; community involvement, political commitment; healthy public policy; multi-sectoral collaboration; and asset-based community development. An asset-based approach involves empowering individuals and communities by focusing on community strengths along with the skills of the individuals.

The CDC states that &quot;Individuals who are in good physical shape, have proper vaccination, have access to clinical services and medications, and know where to get critical health and emergency alert information create a better community than those who have poor health and don&#x27;t understand where to get proper treatment and medicine.&quot;

The Problem, Identification, and Prioritization cycle have three phases that help benefit the community, which is forming a health coalition, collecting and analyzing data for health profile, and identifying critical health issues. The information that is gathered is also distributed to the community to help with important decision-making.

The Analysis and Implementation cycle which helps resolve community health problems by analyzing the health issue, establishing resources, creating a health improvement strategy with the resources, and allocating responsibility throughout the community. Multiple issues are analyzed in conjunction to determine which is most important. Lastly, the authority to act is implemented, sufficient funds are allocated and access to data is released in order for the members of the community to review and move accordingly.

== Community health in the Global South ==
Access to community health in the Global South is influenced by geographic accessibility (physical distance from the service delivery point to the user), availability (proper type of care, service provider, and materials), financial accessibility (willingness and ability of users to purchase services), and acceptability (responsiveness of providers to social and cultural norms of users and their communities). While the Epidemiological transition is shifting the disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable conditions in developing countries, this transition is still in an early stage in parts of the Global South such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Two phenomena in developing countries have created a &quot;medical poverty trap&quot; for underserved communities in the Global South — the introduction of user fees for public healthcare services and the growth of out-of-pocket expenses for private services. The private healthcare sector is being increasingly utilized by low and middle income communities in the Global South for conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections. Private care is characterized by more flexible access, shorter waiting times, and greater choice. Private providers that serve low-income communities are often unqualified and untrained. Some policymakers recommend that governments in developing countries harness private providers to remove state responsibility from service provision.

Community development is frequently used as a public health intervention to empower communities to obtain self-reliance and control over the factors that affect their health. Community health workers are able to draw on their firsthand experience, or local knowledge, to complement the information that scientists and policy makers use when designing health interventions. Interventions with community health workers have been shown to improve access to primary healthcare and quality of care in developing countries through reduced malnutrition rates, improved maternal and child health and prevention and management of HIV/AIDS. Community health workers have also been shown to promote chronic disease management by improving the clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.

Slum-dwellers in the Global South face threats of infectious disease, non-communicable conditions, and injuries due to violence and road traffic accidents. Participatory, multi-objective slum upgrading in the urban sphere significantly improves social determinants that shape health outcomes such as safe housing, food access, political and gender rights, education, and employment status. Efforts have been made to involve the urban poor in project and policy design and implementation. Through slum upgrading, states recognize and acknowledge the rights of the urban poor and the need to deliver basic services. Upgrading can vary from small-scale sector-specific projects (i.e. water taps, paved roads) to comprehensive housing and infrastructure projects (i.e. piped water, sewers). Other projects combine environmental interactions with social programs and political empowerment. Recently, slum upgrading projects have been incremental to prevent the displacement of residents during improvements and attentive to emerging concerns regarding climate change adaptation. By legitimizing slum-dwellers and their right to remain, slum upgrading is an alternative to slum removal and a process that in itself may address the structural determinants of population health.

=== Kenya ===
Community health refers to the first level of health services provision in Kenya that comprises;
# Interventions focusing on building demand for existing health and related services, by improving community awareness and health seeking behavior and 2. Taking defined interventions and services as defined in (Kenya Health Sector Strategic and investment plan KHSSP) close to the community and households.
The current registered association for community Health professionals in Kenya is The Society of Community Health Caregivers. It was registered in the year 2020 to act as an umbrella body for the community health professionals.

<text>Westbury is a neighborhood in the Brays Oaks district of Southwest Houston, Texas, United States. It is located east of Bob White Road, north of U.S. Highway 90 Alternate (South Main Street), and west of South Post Oak Road, adjacent to the Fondren Southwest and Meyerland neighborhoods, just west of the southwest corner of the 610 Loop.

Westbury was named as the 2007 &quot;Best Hidden Neighborhood&quot; by the &quot;Houston Press&quot; .
Westbury was also listed in the 25 Hottest Houston Neighborhoods in the June 2013 edition of &quot;Houstonia Magazine&quot;. .

Areas served by the Westbury Civic Club include Westbury 1-5, Parkwest 1-3, and Westbury South.

==History==
Westbury was developed in the 1950s and 1960s by Ira Berne as part of the post–World War II migration to the suburbs. The developer had moved from Westbury, New York, after which he named the new community. Around 1953 the area known as Sam Houston Airport ended its flight operations where the airport property was redeveloped.

In 1960 Berne had developed the Westbury Square shopping center.

In the 1980s the City of Houston Housing Authority proposed a 105-unit public housing project in the Westbury area. Thousands of residents entered public hearings to protest the concept, so the city did not build any public housing in the Westbury area.

Around the 1980s markets crashed and many of Westbury&#x27;s businesses either closed or became abandoned. Crime increased at this time, but has decreased greatly in recent years. As real estate has become more expensive in gentrified areas such as Houston Heights and Neartown, Westbury has become an attractive place to live for some of Houston&#x27;s gay and lesbian population. Gays and lesbians began moving to Westbury in the 2000s, and some were referring to it as &quot;Little Montrose&quot;.

In April 2010 the City of Houston &quot;automated&quot; curbside recycling program was extended to Westbury East.

In 2011 the Brays Oaks district expanded. Westbury, which was originally not a part of the Brays Oaks district, became a part of it.

==Sections==
Areas served by the Westbury Civic Club include Westbury 1-5, Parkwest 1-3, and Westbury South.

==Demographics==
In 2015 the City of Houston-defined Westbury Super Neighborhood had 20,693 people. 39% were Hispanics, 19% were non-Hispanic blacks, 35% were non-Hispanic whites, 5% were non-Hispanic Asians, and 2% were non-Hispanic others. In 2000 the super neighborhood had 22,090 people. 37% were non-Hispanic whites, 34% were Hispanics, 22% were non-Hispanic blacks, 7% were non-Hispanic Asians, and 1% were non-Hispanic other.

===Local government===

The Westbury Civic Club has its headquarters in Suite 107 at 5322 W. Bellfort.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public schools====

The neighborhood is served by the Houston Independent School District.

The neighborhood is divided between the following attendance zones for elementary school:
*Cynthia Ann Parker Elementary School - In Parkwest Section 1
*Anderson Elementary School - In Westbury Section 4
*Kolter Elementary School in Meyerland
*Tinsley Elementary School

The neighborhood is divided between the following attendance zoned for middle school:
*Meyerland Performing and Visual Arts Middle School (formerly Johnston Middle School)
*Fondren Middle School

Anyone zoned to Johnston may apply to Pin Oak Middle School&#x27;s regular program.

Westbury High School serves almost all of Westbury. A sliver of Westbury is zoned to Bellaire High School.

=====History of public schools=====
Parker Elementary opened in 1959, and Johnston Middle School opened in its current location in 1959. Anderson and Kolter opened in 1960. Westbury High School opened in 1961. Fondren Middle opened in 1966.

Anderson, initially with a capacity of 600, had it increase to 900 as a new wing opened in 1963. In the late 1990s Anderson Elementary was overcrowded due to increasing student populations in Westbury area apartment complexes. In 1996 there were 1,500 students; an additional 300 had been reassigned to other schools. In 1998 the school had almost 1,600 students. Around that time hundreds of students who were zoned to Anderson were bussed to relief campuses.

Tinsley opened in 2002, relieving Anderson and another area school.

As of 2006 many middle and upper class residents of the Westbury attendance zone would not send their children to Westbury; usually they send their children to Bellaire High School, Lamar High School, or private schools.

Medical Center Charter School, a pre-kindergarten through 5th grade charter school, was located in the Westbury area. Despite its name, the school is not located in the Texas Medical Center area. Medical Center Charter School opened in 1996, and catered to employees working in the Medical Center and had the Montessori method, used until grade two. Its specialty as of 2003 was foreign languages. In 2014, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) announced that the school&#x27;s performance was insufficient and that it sought to revoke its charter. By 2018, its charter had closed.

====Private schools====
St. Thomas More School (K-8 , operated by the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston), a neighborhood Roman Catholic school in Maplewood South Section 6.

The neighborhood has or has in close proximity several other private schools, such as Westbury Christian School (K–12) and St. Nicholas School Southwest Campus (K-8).

Trafton Academy and Miss Porter&#x27;s School located in the Willowbend area also serves Westbury residents.

===Public libraries===
Effective 2023, Dr. Shannon Walker Neighborhood Library of the Houston Public Library (HPL) is the library location for Westbury. Its namesake is Shannon Walker.

The Meyer Library in Meyerland opened in 1962. In 1994 the library received renovations to accommodate disabled people. By 2013 HPL planned to purchase land for a new Meyerland branch with $442,000. HPL spokesperson Sandra Fernandez stated that HPL wants to build a new facility in order to increase the size and parking capacity. There was a proposal to move the library to Westbury Square, supported by the Westbury community but opposed by Meyerland residents. In 2015 various proposals on where the replacement library should go were being debated. Prior to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Houston community considered the Meyer Branch to be the Houston library in the poorest state of maintenance. Hurricane Harvey gave the library moderate damage, and the city government closed it afterwards, with demolition scheduled. The new library, which also replaced HPL Express Frank, was to be built at 5505 Belrose on a plot of land, in Westbury Section 3.

==Media==
The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; is the area regional newspaper. On Thursdays, residents receive the Bellaire/West U/River Oaks/Meyerland local section.

The &quot;Bellaire Texan&quot;, which served the Westbury area community in the mid-20th Century, was headquartered in Bellaire and published by the Texan Publishing Corporation. By 1975 it became known as the &quot;Bellaire &amp; Southwestern Texan&quot; and was published by the Preston Publishing Company. It was then headquartered in Houston.

<text>Robert Downie VC, MM (12 January 1894 – 18 April 1968) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==World War I==
Born on 12 January 1894 in Glasgow, Scotland, he was 22 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Dublin Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 October 1916 east of Lesboeufs, France, when most of the officers had become casualties, Sergeant Downie, utterly regardless of personal danger and under very heavy fire, organised the attack which had been temporarily checked. At the critical moment he rushed forward shouting &quot;Come on the Dubs!&quot; which had an immediate response and the line rushed forward at this call. Sergeant Downie accounted for several of the enemy and in addition captured a machine-gun, killing the team. Although wounded early in the fight, he remained with his company, giving valuable assistance while the position was being consolidated.

On his homecoming, he arrived at Glasgow Central Station to be met by hundreds of people who carried him shoulder-high to a taxi. Springburn Road was decorated with flags and bunting and lined with hundreds more people, and his achievement was widely reported in the Glasgow press.

==Post World War I==
On 8 June 1946, Robert attended the World War II Victory Day Celebration Reception held at the Dorchester Hotel, London.

He lived in Charleston Street, Springburn, until his death in 1968. Football fans at Celtic Park regularly saw him on a Saturday as he worked as a cashier at the turnstiles. A modest man, he often played down his bravery, saying he won the medals for having &#x27;shot the cook&#x27;. He died on 18 April 1968.

Downie has a grave/memorial at St Kentigern&#x27;s Cemetery, Glasgow, Scotland. Section 21. Lair 506. Headstone.

<doc id="1223567" wikidata="Q7271267" url="?curid=1223567" title="Quentin Griffin">
<text>Quentin LaVell Griffin (born January 12, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oklahoma Sooners.

==Early life== 
Griffin started his football career as a youth playing in the Humble Area Football League. Griffin starred at Nimitz High School in Houston.

==College career==
As a sophomore at Oklahoma, Griffin ran for 783 yards and 16 touchdowns and added 45 receptions for 406 yards. He was an All-Big 12 first team selection and was named to the Big 12 All-academic team, his first of three consecutive nominations to both squads. Junior totals were 182 for 884 with 9 touchdowns on the ground with 55 for 448 and 2 touchdowns as a receiver, and as a senior totaled 287 carries for 1,884 yards with 15 scores, placing him second in the league for rushing. Also caught 35 passes for 264 yards with three additional scores. The three-year starter helped his school win a national championship in 2000 and he finished fourth in school history in career rushing yards (3,756), third in touchdowns (44) and chose to preserve Billy Sims’ record and finish second in all-purpose yards (4,973). He had an Oklahoma-record six rushing touchdowns against Texas in 2000.

==Professional==
Griffin was selected by the Denver Broncos of the National Football League with the 11th pick of the fourth round (108th overall) in the 2003 NFL draft. He went on to appear in 16 games, including five starts in his initial two seasons in the league. He even set a Broncos franchise record in 2004 for most rushing yards in a season opener with a career-high 156 yards on 23 carries against the Kansas City Chiefs while also scoring the first three touchdowns of his pro career. His rise to the top came to a sudden halt in 2004 when he tore the ACL in his right knee in Week 7, ending his season early.

Although he was highly productive in two seasons with the Broncos, totaling 179 rushes for 656 yards (3.7 avg.) and two touchdowns, in addition to catching 18 passes for 129 yards and one score, the injury caused him to drop to the bottom of the depth chart behind Mike Anderson, Tatum Bell and Ron Dayne. In September 2005, Denver released Griffin and then brought him back a few weeks later, only to release him again the next month, but this time for good.

In March 2006, Griffin agreed to terms with the Kansas City Chiefs on a one-year deal, but in September 2006, he was cut from the team.

On February 23, 2007, Griffin was chosen by the Hamburg Sea Devils as the second overall pick in the NFL Europa Free Agent Draft. Griffin was the Sea Devils&#x27; top rusher with a 4.6 yard average and was third-best among starting running backs in the NFLE. The multi-dimensional Griffin also led NFL Europa in kickoff return average.

On February 29, 2008, he was signed to a one-year plus an option year contract with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He was released by the Roughriders on June 20, 2008, following the team&#x27;s final preseason game. According to media reports, Roughriders&#x27; head coach Ken Miller was &quot;so upset with Griffin following (the game) that he cut the former NFLer at the airport.&quot; Griffin had reportedly pulled himself out of the game early in the second quarter, telling the coaches &quot;he didn&#x27;t have any interest in playing a preseason game where he might get hurt.&quot;

In July 2013, Griffin signed with the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes in Germany (GFL1). As of 2016, he is no longer on the team because the running back transitioned from playing football to coaching football.

==Coaching==
Griffin took his first coaching job with Missouri Southern State University. In July 2018, he left MSSU for the position of running backs coach for the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) Panthers. After one season at UNI, Griffin took a position as Assistant Football Coach (Running Backs) at Blinn College in Brenham, Texas.

<text>Deepa Mehta, (; born 15 September 1950) is an Indian-born Canadian film director and screenwriter, best known for her Elements Trilogy, &quot;Fire&quot; (1996), &quot;Earth&quot; (1998), and &quot;Water&quot; (2005).

&quot;Earth&quot; was submitted by India as its official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and &quot;Water&quot; was Canada&#x27;s official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, making it only the third non-French-language Canadian film submitted in that category after Attila Bertalan&#x27;s 1990 invented-language film &quot;A Bullet to the Head&quot; and Zacharias Kunuk&#x27;s 2001 Inuktitut-language feature &quot;&quot;.

She co-founded Hamilton-Mehta Productions, with her husband, producer David Hamilton in 1996. She was awarded a Genie Award in 2003 for the screenplay of &quot;Bollywood/Hollywood&quot;. In May 2012, Mehta received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

==Early life==
Mehta was born in Amritsar, Punjab near the militarized border of Pakistan and experienced firsthand the impacts brought forth by the Partition of India. She describes learning about warfare from citizens of Lahore, stating &quot;Even when I was growing up in Amritsar, we used to go every weekend to Lahore, so I just grew up around people who talked about it incessantly and felt it was one of the most horrific sectarian wars they knew of.&quot;

Her family moved to New Delhi while she was still a child, and her father worked as a film distributor. Subsequently, Mehta attended Welham Girls High School, boarding school in Dehradun on the foothills of Himalayas. She graduated from the Lady Shri Ram College for Women, University of Delhi with a degree in Philosophy.

Mehta notes how her reception to film transformed and changed as she got older and was exposed to different types of cinema, which ultimately influenced her to become a filmmaker herself. She states:

&quot;When I was growing up in Delhi and I went to university in Delhi, I used to watch [Indian] films. I grew up with a very healthy dose of Indian commercial cinema. My father was a film distributor, so from a very young age I saw commercial Indian cinema. But once I went to university, or even my last year of school, I really started watching and enjoying Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak and had exposure to non-Hindi cinema and non-Hollywood cinema. At university, I was also exposed to directors like Truffaut and Godard. There was also intense exposure to Japanese cinema. So, Ozu, Mizoguchi.&quot;

==Career==
After graduating Mehta began working for a production company that made documentary and educational films for the Indian government. During the production of her first feature-length documentary focusing on the working life of a child bride, she met and married Canadian documentary filmmaker Paul Saltzman, who was in India making a film. She migrated to Toronto to live with her husband in 1973, and was credited in some of her early films as Deepa Saltzman.

Once in Canada, Mehta and Saltzman along with Mehta&#x27;s brother Dilip started Sunrise Films, a production company, initially producing documentaries but moved into television production creating the television series &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; (1977–79) about the creative and artistic work of young people from around the world. Additionally, Mehta directed several episodes of the Saltzman produced CBC drama &quot;Danger Bay&quot; (1984–90).

Mehta also directed the documentaries &quot;At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch&quot; (1975) and &quot;Traveling Light&quot; (1986), the latter focusing on the work of Mehta&#x27;s brother Dilip as a photojournalist. &quot;Traveling Light&quot; would go on to be nominated for three Gemini Awards. In 1987, based on the works of Alice Munro, Cynthia Flood and Betty Lambert, Mehta produced and co-directed &quot;Martha, Ruth and Edie&quot;. Screened at the Cannes International Film Festival, it would go on to win the Best Feature Film Award at the 11th International Film Festival in Florence in 1988.

In 1991 she made her feature-film directorial debut with &quot;Sam &amp; Me&quot;, a story of the relationship between a young Indian boy and an elderly Jewish gentleman in the Toronto neighbourhood of Parkdale. It broke the record at the time for the highest-budgeted film directed by a woman in Canada at $11 million. It won Honorable Mention in the Camera d&#x27;Or category of the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Mehta followed this with her film &quot;Camilla&quot; starring Bridget Fonda and Jessica Tandy in 1994. In 2002, she directed &quot;Bollywood/Hollywood&quot;, for which she won the Genie Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Mehta directed two episodes of George Lucas&#x27; television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. The first episode, &quot;Benares, January 1910&quot;, aired in 1993. The second episode was aired in 1996 as part of a TV movie titled &quot;Young Indiana Jones: Travels with Father&quot;.

Mehta directed several English-language films set in Canada, including &quot;The Republic of Love&quot; (2003) and &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; (2008) which deals with domestic violence and has Preity Zinta playing the female lead. It premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. Also in 2008 Mehta produced the documentary &quot;The Forgotten Woman&quot;, directed by her brother Dilip.

In 2005 it was announced that Mehta would film an adaptation of Shilpi Somaya Gowda’s &quot;Secret Daughter&quot;with a cast including Amitabh Bachchan, John Abraham, Seema Biswas and Terence Stamp in and Nandita Das, Manisha Koirala, Mahima Chaudhry, and Padma Lakshmi in supporting roles. The film, titled &quot;Exclusion&quot;, was to have music by A. R. Rahman, and cinematography and editing by Giles Nuttgens and Colin Monie respectively. It would have been based on the Komagata Maru incident, an incident where Canada turned away 397 Indian dissidents as a part of a policy to keep Canada racially white. But, although the project was postponed for many years, the film remained unrealised.

In 2015, Mehta wrote and directed &quot;Beeba Boys&quot;. It premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2016, Mehta directed the drama film &quot;Anatomy of Violence&quot;, which uses fiction to explore the root causes which led to the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder.

On 29 October 2020, Telefilm Canada announced that Mehta&#x27;s film &quot;Funny Boy&quot; (2020) would represent Canada in the Academy Awards race for best international feature film. However, the film was disqualified by the Academy Awards as its mix of English, Sinhala and Tamil dialogue did not surpass the required percentage of non-English dialogue.

At the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, Mehta won the Best Director award for &quot;Funny Boy&quot;. She and cowriter Shyam Selvadurai also won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

In November 2021, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Mehta is set to direct a film adaptation of Avni Doshi&#x27;s novel &quot;Burnt Sugar&quot;, with Ben Silverman&#x27;s Propagate Content producing the film.

===Elements trilogy===
Mehta is best known for her Elements Trilogy — &quot;Fire&quot; (1996), &quot;Earth&quot; (1998) (released in India as &quot;1947: Earth&quot;), and &quot;Water&quot; (2005) — which won her much critical acclaim. Some notable actors who have worked in this trilogy are Aamir Khan, Seema Biswas, Shabana Azmi, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, John Abraham, Rahul Khanna, Lisa Ray, and Nandita Das. These films are also notable for Mehta&#x27;s collaborative work with author Bapsi Sidhwa. Sidhwa&#x27;s novel &quot;Cracking India&quot; (1991, U.S.; 1992, India; originally published as &quot;Ice Candy Man&quot;, 1988, England) is the basis for Mehta&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Earth&quot;.

Mehta describes the conception of the idea for the &quot;Elements&quot; films to be extremely organic. She first conceived of the idea for &quot;Water&quot; while shooting in Varanasi, stating &quot;You know, you read about widows — my grandmother is a widow — but I had never seen such institutionalization of widows until I went to Varanasi. There was a widow there called Gyanvati who was about 80 years old, and through her I got to know about ashrams and found it very moving. I thought that if I make a film, it would be about something surrounding widows; then I forgot about it. Then I wrote &quot;Fire&quot;.&quot;

After completing the filming process for &quot;Fire&quot;, Mehta told Shabana Azmi that her next film would be an adaptation of Bapsi Sidwha&#x27;s &quot;Cracking India&quot;; when Azmi asked what it would be called, Mehta replied: &quot;Earth&quot;. Mehta maintains that each film centers on politics of a certain phenomenon.

&quot;Fire&quot; follows the love affair between two sisters-in-law whose own sexless marriages bring them together in a passionate romance. It caused controversy upon its release as several Hindutva groups took issue with its central lesbian romance, one that was seen to break traditional family and religious value within society, as there were protests in cities across India. Internationally, the film was critically acclaimed and would go on to win the Most Popular Canadian Film at the Vancouver International Film Festival. This was also the first feature length dramatic film which Mehta both wrote and directed, a practice which she would continue throughout the rest of her career.

&quot;Earth&quot; focuses on the time before and during the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 and how the life of one family was uprooted by this historical event. The central focus for &quot;Earth&quot; was intended to be about &quot;the division of the earth, but it is also metaphoric- what does our matrubhoomi (motherland) mean to us?&quot; The film resembled Mehta&#x27;s own family history as her parents fled the newly created Pakistan in 1947 whilst Mehta herself was born in Punjab, not far from the Indian/Pakistan border.

&quot;Water&quot; is about is an eight-year-old girl who is suddenly widowed. In keeping with traditions of widowhood, she is left in an ashram, where she is to live from then on. The film, meant to be shot in India, was attacked by Hindu fundamentalists who saw the film as disrespectful and who took issues with Mehta&#x27;s earlier films and their portrayal of Hindu culture. The regional government overruled the permission given from the central government to the production which allowed them to film in the holy city of Varanasi. Eventually the production moved to Sri Lanka. &quot;Water&quot; opened the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006.

===&quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;===
Mehta directed &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; after collaborating on the screenplay with the novel&#x27;s author, Salman Rushdie. Indian American actor Satya Bhabha played the role of Saleem Sinai while other roles were played by Shriya Saran, Seema Biswas, Shabana Azmi, Anupam Kher, Siddharth Narayan, Rahul Bose, Soha Ali Khan, Shahana Goswami and Darsheel Safary.

The film was released on 9 September 2012 at Toronto International Film Festival and would be nominated for Best Motion Picture along with 7 other nominations at the Canadian Screen Awards.

== Themes ==
Many of Mehta&#x27;s films across her career have focused on the duality of her national and cultural identity which has informed much of her filmmaking as she has been described as the &quot;quintessential transnational filmmaker&quot;. With her childhood and heritage informing her of key Indian and Hindu traditions, she has been seen to compare these practices with a more &quot;Westernized&quot; philosophy that has often resulted in controversy. The production of her film &quot;Water&quot; was delayed by protests from Hindu fundamentalists whilst several of her other films releases have seen boycotts across India, including the film &quot;Fire.&quot;

Mehta&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; trilogy notably explores themes of the emergence of new identities, particularly in the context of independence. In &quot;Fire&quot;, the older character Radha&#x27;s sense of agency and empowerment increases as she becomes sexually liberated through the younger character Sita. Professor Subeshini Moodley discusses how these women employ their bodies to cross boundaries &amp; borders, stating how “their bodies being the marginal spaces that they occupy, these protagonists don’t always begin as women with agency, but grow and develop to that point. Their marginal spaces are first defined in order to show how they later redefine and transcend its boundaries”. Put otherwise, by allowing themselves to explore their sexuality with each other, these women are breaking free of the restrictive confines of the traditional female Indian archetype that used to define their value (such as traits of virtue &amp; obedience), and instead are reclaiming their power by transgressing the boundaries of their culture.

Another way in which &quot;Fire&quot; exemplifies the emergence of modern female identities is through its deliberate defiance of patriarchal structures through religious &amp; cultural symbolism. The protagonists’ names of Radha and Sita are direct references to the heroines of the traditional Hindu epic, Ramayana, in which the characters Radha and Sita represent contrasting elements of feminine virtue; Radha embodying the playful adventuress and Sita being the dutiful and dedicated wife. However, Mehta switches the defining characteristics of these characters for her film, making Radha the obedient matriarch and Sita the inquisitive newlywed. This is important to note when discussing a key scene in the film in which after Ashok learns of his wife’s affair with Sita, Radha’s sari catches fire from the kitchen stove and she nearly becomes engulfed in flames. This is a clear allusion to a sequence from the Ramayana in which Sita is forced to prove her purity for her husband Rama by walking through a fire. Dr. David Burton discusses how Mehta’s film subverts the traditional symbolism of the religious epic through its reversed meaning; in Fire, Radha survives the fire not to represent her purity for her husband, but rather to “assert her freedom from patriarchal control and traditional notions of sexual purity”, once again conveying how the film effectively depicts the inception of modernity in the female realm.

As previously mentioned, Mehta based &quot;Earth&quot; on Pakistani author Bapsi Sidwha&#x27;s acclaimed 1988 novel &quot;Ice Candy Man&quot;, which employs a young Parsi girl from a wealthy family as its protagonist. Mehta&#x27;s decision to maintain such a privileged protagonist is noteworthy; in one scene, Lenny’s mother attempts to explain to her daughter the role which Parsis play in the movement for India’s independence, in which she compares Parsis in India to sugar in milk: “sweet but invisible”. While this takes on a negative connotation within the film, in a larger historical context, Lenny’s observation further supports Mehta’s decision to have the film’s protagonist taken on by a figure of such religious, cultural and ethnic ambivalence. The main goal of Lenny’s wealthy Parsi family is to stay neutral during the political tensions of Partition, and her astute renouncement of her family’s invisibility only reinforces this. Furthermore, “the fact that Lenny is neither Hindu nor Muslim [frees] the narrative from a divisive communal dichotomy”. Lenny’s whole world is encompassed by her relationship with her Hindu nanny, her nanny’s adoration from two Muslim men, and their diverse friend group. When the conflict of Partition tears the group apart, Lenny’s whole world is simultaneously destroyed, and her humanist perspective allows for an unbiased portrayal of the negative effects which a fear of change and breaking tradition can inflict upon a society’s health.

Mehta&#x27;s last film in the &quot;Elements&quot; trilogy, &quot;Water&quot;, showcases the gross oppression endured by Indian women during precolonial times. It also depicts the mistreatment of widows to present strong support for the breaking of traditional social norms and an embrace of contemporary identities for Indian women. One example of this can be seen through the Hindu male hegemony’s reliance upon the authority of Hindu scriptures to rationalize the mistreatment of widows. In &quot;Water&quot;, when Narayan’s father is revealed to be a former client of Kalyani, he attempts to justify his sexual exploits to his son by using his class privilege, stating that Brahmins can sleep with whomever they want as the women they sleep with are blessed. Narayan’s response that Brahmins who interpret the Holy Scripture for their own benefit should not be honored elucidates the immense hypocrisy which underlines various ancient religious ideologies that are often employed solely by the caste of men who seek to benefit from such outdated customs. Burton also points out how such selfish reworkings of religious ideologies is the real killer of faith, instead of Mehta’s sensational films. He states, “Reformers… who often view the negative aspects of their religion as misreadings and cultural accretions are themselves in danger of essentializing Hinduism insofar as they imply that the version of Hinduism of which they approve is the only genuine one”. In other words, the insistence to uphold such outdated structures of patriarchal hegemony simply on the basis of religiosity is in itself more blasphemous and sacrilegious than any sin outlined by ancient scriptures. However, there are certain elements of Water that allude to the positivity of embracing modernity. For example, Chuyia’s eventual rescue by Shakuntala and potentially happy future with Narayan presents the promise of Gandhi-influenced reform within Indian society.

Mehta often uses her films to explore the impacts of cultural and political unrest on the lives of normal citizens, stating, &quot;A driving force in the stories I want to tell is definitely curiosity. I was intrigued by sectarian war. I’m appalled by it. I was immensely curious about how it affects the everywoman and everyman.&quot;

==Personal life==
In India, she met and married filmmaker Paul Saltzman whom she divorced in 1983. The couple have a daughter, Devyani Saltzman, an author, curator and cultural critic.

<text>William Griffiths VC (1841 – 22 January 1879) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. 

==Details==
His VC not awarded for bravery in action against the enemy, but for bravery at sea in saving life in storm off Andaman Islands. Griffiths, born in County Roscommon, was about 26 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Andaman Islands Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 7 May 1867 at the island of Little Andaman, eastern India, in the Bay of Bengal, Private Griffiths was one of a party of five (David Bell, James Cooper, Campbell Mellis Douglas and Thomas Murphy) of the 2/24th Regiment, who risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through dangerous surf to rescue some of their comrades who had been sent to the island to find out the fate of the commander and seven of the crew, who had landed from the ship &quot;Assam Valley&quot; and were feared murdered by the cannibalistic islanders.

The citation was gazetted on 17 December 1867:

THE Queen has been graciously pleased to signify Her intention to confer the decoration of the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned Officer and Private Soldiers of Her Majesty&#x27;s Army, whose claims to the same have been submitted for Her Majesty&#x27;s approval, for their gallant conduct at the Little Andaman Island, as recorded against their names, viz. :—

2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment: Assistant-Surgeon Campbell Millis Douglas, M.D, Private Thomas Murphy, Private James Cooper, Private David Bell, Private William Griffiths.

For the very gallant and daring manner in which, on the 7th of May, 1867, they risked their lives in manning a boat and proceeding through a dangerous surf to the rescue of some of their comrades, who formed part of an expedition which had been sent to the Island of Little Andaman, by order of the Chief Commissioner of British Burmah, with the view of ascertaining the fate of the Commander and seven of the crew of the ship &quot; Assam Valley,&quot; who had landed there, and were supposed to have been murdered by the
natives.

The officer who commanded the troops on the occasion reports : About an hour later in the day Dr. Douglas, 2nd Battalion, 24th
.&quot;Regiment, and the four Privates referred&quot; to, gallantly manning the second gig, made their way through the surf almost to the shore, but finding their boat was half filled with water, they retired. A second attempt made by Dr. Douglas and party proved successful, five of us being safely passed through the surf to the boats outside. A third and last trip got the whole of the party left on shore safe to the boats. It is stated that Dr. Douglas accomplished these trips through the surf to the shore by no ordinary exertion. He stood in the bows of the boat, and worked her in an intrepid and seamanlike manner, cool to a degree, as
if what he was then doing was an ordinary act of every-day life. The four Privates behaved in an equally cool and collected manner, rowing through the roughest surf when the slightest hesitation or want of pluck on the part of any one of them would have been
attended by the gravest results. It is reported that seventeen officers and men were thus saved from what must otherwise have been a fearful risk, if not certainty of death.
He was killed in action, in the Battle of Isandhlwana in Zululand, on 22 January 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh &quot;(Brecon, Powys, Wales)&quot;.

<text>Kronberg im Taunus is a town in the Hochtaunuskreis district, Hesse, Germany and part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. Before 1866, it was in the Duchy of Nassau; in that year the whole Duchy was absorbed into Prussia. Kronberg lies at the foot of the Taunus, flanked in the north and southwest by forests. A mineral water spring also rises in the town.

==Geography==
===Neighbouring communities===

Kronberg borders in the north and east on the town of Oberursel, in the southeast on the town of Steinbach, in the south on the towns of Eschborn and Schwalbach (both in Main-Taunus-Kreis), and in the west on the town of Königstein.

===Constituent communities===
Kronberg consists of the three centres of Kronberg (8,108 inhabitants), Oberhöchstadt (6,363 inhabitants) and Schönberg (3,761 inhabitants).

==History==

=== 1220–1704 ===

When Kronberg Castle was built (about 1220) it was shared by the Knights of Askenburne (Eschborn), who owned a towered castle there. The &quot;Kronenstamm&quot; (&quot;stamm&quot; = stem) moved to Kronberg, giving themselves that name at the time, while the &quot;Flügelstamm&quot; (&quot;wing stem&quot;) followed them there only 30 years later.

Town rights were granted the small settlement on 25 April 1330 by Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. As of 1367, the town also had market rights as well as &quot;Blutgerichtsbarkeit&quot; (meaning that there was an Imperial court authorized to mete out bodily punishment, including death), granted by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Together with those from Hattstein Castle and Reifenberg Castle, the Knights of Kronberg from Frankfurt declared the so-called &quot;Kronberg Feud&quot; in 1389. When on 13 May a great force from Frankfurt swept to Kronberg Castle, Hanau (Ulrich von Hanau) and the Electorate of the Palatinate (150 of Ruprecht von der Pfalz&#x27;s cuirassiers) troops rushed to help those being beset, driving the Frankfurt forces off on 14 May in the Battle of Eschborn and taking 620 prisoners, among them the mayor, a few noble council members and all the town&#x27;s bakers, butchers, locksmiths and shoemakers.

The story is told in Kronberg that during the battle one of the knights of Kronberg was unhorsed, and because he lacked a replacement mount, he returned to battle on a donkey. Legend has it that it was the unearthly noise the donkey made in battle that made the Frankfurt army run, and this gave birth to the third &quot;Stem&quot;, the Ohrenstam (Earstem) - with a pair of donkeys ears on its coat of arms.

Only the huge ransom of 73,000 golden guilders – negotiated on 22 August, the pain of which Frankfurt would feel for 120 years – ended the fight with Frankfurt and laid the groundwork for the &quot;Frankfurter Landwehr&quot; fortifications. Peace was, however, quickly concluded (1391) and alliance sought with Kronberg. In 1394, the council appointed Hartmuth von Cronberg to a two-year term as Bailiff of Bonames, and in 1395, Johann von Cronberg concluded a detailed treaty of federation with Frankfurt, which the Kronbergers bound the Frankfurters and their masses to protect. Finally, in 1398, the &quot;Schießgesellen zu Cronenberg&quot; (&quot;Journeymen shooters of Kronberg&quot;) invited the &quot;Schießgesellen zue Franckenfurd unsern guten frunden&quot; (&quot;Journeymen shooters of Frankfurt, our good friends&quot;) to a &quot;Schießen umb eyn Cleynod&quot; (&quot;shoot for a treasure&quot;). The letter bearing this message is said to be Germany&#x27;s oldest surviving invitation to a shooting event (this refers to early weapons, since firearms were as yet unknown).

Since Hartmut XII of Kronberg, who is said to be the town&#x27;s Reformer, had earlier stood by his cousin Franz von Sickingen in his attack on Trier and Worms, Archbishop Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads of Trier, Ludwig V of the Electorate of the Palatinate and Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse attacked the town and the castle at Kronberg in 1522 and forced an unconditional surrender. Hartmut fled, and Philip introduced the Reformation throughout Hesse. However, since Kronberg was an Imperial fief, Philip had to give the castle and town back to Hartmut in 1541 under the issuing of property rights for the Lutheran Church. These rights were affirmed by Hesse-Darmstadt in the 17th and 18th centuries, ensuring that Mainz&#x27;s later attempts at a Counterreformation (1626–1649) and the &quot;Simultanisierung&quot; (1737–1768) would never enjoy success.

In 1704, the last member of the ruling family, Herr Johann Niclas von und zu Cronberg, died childless at Hohlenfels Castle in Mudershausen. Kronberg, along with the communities of Schönberg, Niederhöchstadt and Eschborn therefore passed to the Electorate of Mainz.

=== 1704–1866 ===
It was under Mainz&#x27;s rule that the nowadays so-called &quot;Dispute Church&quot; (&quot;Streitkirche&quot;) was built, having been planned as a Catholic church in 1758 to be built right next to the Evangelical church. This led to great protests by the town&#x27;s Evangelical majority, whose plight reached the Eternal Imperial Diet (&quot;Immerwährender Reichstag&quot;) in Regensburg, where the Evangelicals were granted their wish, and although the building was built anyway, it was never consecrated as a church. Since 1768, the building has served secular purposes (as a pharmacy, guesthouse, and today as the Kronberg Painters&#x27; Colony&#x27;s museum).
In the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801, the Electorate of Mainz lost its worldly territory, including the Imperial fief of Kronberg, which was confiscated by the Prince of Nassau-Usingen in 1802, and formally awarded to him in 1803. In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Duke of Nassau sided with Austria, thereby losing his land to Prussia.

=== 1866–1945 ===

Wealthy industrialists, traders and bankers discovered the little Taunus town&#x27;s idyllic and climatically advantageous setting right near Frankfurt in the middle of the 19th century and built villas and summer homes in Kronberg and Schönberg. Even artists, among them Anton Burger and Jakob Fürchtegott Dielmann, came to Kronberg and founded the Kronberg Painters&#x27; Colony, which lasted into the 20th century. Some of the Kronberg painters&#x27; works are on display in the museum at the &quot;Dispute Church&quot;. The small town, for so long shaped by smallholders and craftsmen reached in its &quot;Prussian epoch&quot; its first upswing with the building of the Kronberg-Rödelheim railway (1874) and the luxurious &quot;Schloss Friedrichshof&quot; (1889–94) often called &quot;Kronberg&quot;, the residence of Princess Victoria, eldest daughter of Queen Victoria and German Dowager Empress.

=== Since 1945 ===
After the Second World War, Kronberg belonged to &quot;Gross-Hessen&quot; (&quot;Greater Hesse&quot; – a provisional name for the state that was later dropped), and remains in Hesse today.

In 1946, the Papal Mission for Displaced Persons in Germany was moved to Kronberg by Pope Pius XII. The apostolic visitor and leader of the institution was the Bishop of Fargo, North Dakota, USA Aloisius Muench, who was of German heritage. His spiritual guidance mandate included caring for those who had fled or been driven out of Eastern Europe. Until the summer of 1949, he organized from Kronberg the transport of about 950 goods wagons full of Papal aid supplies to Germany. He was also supported by the US Government; before taking his position in Kronberg, he received from US Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson the document of appointment as liaison commissioner for religious affairs to the US military government in Germany. Through his contacts in the USA Muench arranged a formidable flow of donations into destruction-stricken Germany. After the Federal Republic of Germany was founded, the Kronberg Apostolic Mission was dissolved in 1951. Muench afterwards became the first Apostolic Nuncio in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). In 1959, Pope John XXIII made Archbishop Muench a Cardinal.

Since 28 June 1966, Kronberg has been a state-recognized spa town.

As part of Hesse&#x27;s municipal reforms, on 1 April 1972, Kronberg merged with the formerly independent communities of Oberhöchstadt and Schönberg.

==Transport==

Kronberg is the terminus of the S-Bahn line S4, successor to the Kronberg Railway, which connects Kronberg with Frankfurt city center, the main train station, and the neighboring city of Eschborn. The S-Bahn is part of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund.

For this purpose exists in Kronberg since 2001, a city bus network of three routes. Like the S-Bahn, it is integrated into the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund and carries around 380,000 people a year. The offer is complemented by a call-collecting taxi, which covers some geographical gaps of the city bus and serves for operating hour extension. In addition, regional bus lines connect Kronberg with the neighboring cities and the nearby Frankfurt Northwest Center.

The first years of operation of the Kronberg city bus were characterized by controversial political discussions, not only in the city council, but also within the population. This was due to initial planning errors that initially reduced the acceptance of the offer, as well as changing political majorities. Although the city bus has meanwhile (2011) established itself in a positive sense, are now due to the poor budgetary situation again cuts in urban transport offer in the middle.

Since early 2013, the Frankfurt Department of Transportation has a possible extension of the subway line 6 to Eschborn examine, which ends at the Heerstraße in Frankfurt-Praunheim. The Frankfurt Department of Transportation has commissioned a correspondingly concrete study of the project. A stop in the industrial park Helfmann-Park is possible. This would, according to the mayor of Eschborn &quot;further enhance the location Eschborn&quot;. An exact timetable for the project does not exist yet. In the foreseeable future, there will be a meeting with representatives from Eschborn, Frankfurt and Oberursel on the subway theme. The Greens in the Hochtaunuskreis have recently advocated upgrading the U6 via Eschborn with stops in Steinbach and Kronberg. The city of Oberursel in the high tunnel circle was long ago connected via the U3 to the Frankfurt subway network.

==Economy and infrastructure==

Kronberg is home to the national headquarters of a number of international firms, such as Accenture, Braun GmbH (Gillette), Celanese and Fidelity International.

Agriculturally, Kronberg is known best of all for its sweet chestnuts and strawberry fields; there are also a few &quot;Streuobstwiesen&quot;, meadows that also support a variety of different fruit trees. There are Mineral springs in the Kronthal.
