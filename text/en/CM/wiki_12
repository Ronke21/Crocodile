<text>Stephen Jesse Jackson (born April 5, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player who played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the New Jersey Nets, Atlanta Hawks, Indiana Pacers, Golden State Warriors, Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Bobcats, San Antonio Spurs, and Los Angeles Clippers. Jackson won an NBA championship with the Spurs in 2003. Jackson emerged as an activist and spokesman for civil rights during the Black Lives Matter movement.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Houston, Texas, and spent his childhood in Port Arthur, Texas. Growing up, Jackson was raised by his mother, Judyette, a single parent who worked two jobs. As a teenager, Jackson worked in his grandfather&#x27;s soul food restaurant in Port Arthur, where he would wash dishes and bus tables. At the age of 16, Jackson&#x27;s half-brother Donald Buckner died at 25 years old from head injuries after being jumped. Following the violent tragedy, Jackson said that he wished he could have been there to assist and protect a member of his family. &quot;You can&#x27;t tell me seeing his brother die that way hasn&#x27;t had an effect,&quot; recalls Pacers CEO Donnie Walsh. &quot;To me, it&#x27;s why he is always coming to the help of his teammates.&quot;

Jackson led Lincoln High School to a state championship in his junior year. However, facing academic &quot;ineligibility&quot; at Lincoln, he transferred to Oak Hill Academy (Virginia), where he earned All-American honors in 1996. He was the leading scorer in the 1996 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Boys Game, on a team that included Kobe Bryant, Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and Tim Thomas.

Following a commitment to join the University of Arizona, Jackson was deemed academically ineligible due to his low SAT and ACT test scores. He instead attended Butler County Community College of El Dorado, Kansas for one semester, but did not play basketball there. Prior to the 1997 NBA draft, Jackson participated in several pickup games with the Phoenix Suns after family friend Virginia Bibby (mother of NBA player Mike Bibby) brought him to the Suns arena during tryouts. Jackson&#x27;s strong play, and particularly his fearlessness against the Suns&#x27; Cedric Ceballos, is largely what led to team president Danny Ainge drafting him months later.

==Professional career==

===CBA and foreign leagues (1997–2000)===
Jackson was selected 42nd overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns, yet did not play as he was waived by the team on October 30. Following this development, Jackson then saw action in six games with the La Crosse Bobcats over two on-and-off seasons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), in which he averaged 2.7 points in 12.7 minutes per game. Additionally, Jackson played four games in 1998 with the Sydney Kings in Australia&#x27;s National Basketball League. Continuing his basketball journey, Jackson played professionally in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. Throughout the spring and summer of 2000, Jackson played in those Latin American countries, with the Dominican Republic teams San Carlos and Pueblo Nuevo and the Venezuelan team the Marinos. In the 1999 season in Venezuela, Jackson played 48 games and averaged 22.8 points (third in the league), 3.9 assists and 3 steals per game, shooting 42.6% from three (second in the league).

===New Jersey Nets (2000–2001)===
Jackson did not play an NBA game until the 2000–01 season with the New Jersey Nets, officially deemed his rookie season. He appeared in 77 games (including 40 starts), in which he averaged 8.2 points per game, and established a close friendship with star point guard Stephon Marbury. The Nets did not have interest in retaining him.

===San Antonio Spurs (2001–2003)===
Before the 2001–2002 NBA season, Jackson was signed by the San Antonio Spurs. He was hampered by injuries, missing 45 games. Former assistant coach Mike Brown stated: &quot;The first year we had him in San Antonio, he was on the (injured reserve) most of the year. At first, he didn&#x27;t understand why because he probably was the most talented player we had on that team, but he needed to mature a little bit so we stuck him there to see how he would respond. He was the best teammate on our team that first year. He was juiced at practice ready to play and compete and make the starters better, and it carried over into his second year when he got his opportunity to get out onto the floor and prove he could be a vital part of the organization.&quot; His season averages were 3.9 points and 1.1 rebounds, logging approximately 9.9 minutes per game. During the 2002–2003 NBA season, Jackson became a key member of the Spurs. Appearing in 80 games (58 starts), his season averages were 11.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 28.2 minutes per game. During the team&#x27;s run in the 2003 NBA Playoffs, Jackson proved to be a vital asset and helped the Spurs win their second NBA title, averaging 12.8 points per game during the playoffs –- the team&#x27;s 3rd leading scorer. Jackson&#x27;s first foray into the playoffs produced variable results in terms of individual performances. Through the course of the postseason, Jackson vacillated between fourth quarter heroics and clutch shooting (elimination games of the Western Conference Finals versus the Dallas Mavericks and NBA Finals versus the New Jersey Nets) and uneven, mistake-prone play (26 turnovers in the 6-game championship series).

===Atlanta Hawks (2003–2004)===
In 2003, Jackson became a free agent during the offseason and expected to parlay his success with the Spurs into a long-term contract. After rejecting an initial offer by the Spurs, he and his agent were criticized by sports media for miscalculating the market. Eventually, Jackson agreed to a 2-year contract with the Atlanta Hawks. Registering his best professional season to date, Jackson established season averages of 18.1 points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game in 80 total games (78 starts). On March 12, against the Washington Wizards, Jackson scored a career-best 42 points. In the 29 games following the All-Star Break, Jackson averaged 24.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 2.2 steals per game. During this stretch, he was the NBA&#x27;s 6th leading scorer.

Following the 2003–04 NBA season, he was traded to the Indiana Pacers for power forward Al Harrington (who finished 2nd place in Sixth Man of the Year voting), after signing a 6-year, $38.3 million contract.

===Indiana Pacers (2004–2007)===
During his first season as a member of the Indiana Pacers in the 2004–05 NBA season, Jackson tallied averages of 18.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game.

On November 19, 2004, during The Malice at the Palace, Jackson was involved in a brawl with fans in the stands at The Palace of Auburn Hills. In the aftermath, Jackson was suspended for 30 games without pay, thereby losing $1.7 million in salary. He was also put on probation for a year, fined $250, and ordered to undergo anger management classes and perform 60 hours of community service. After he failed to complete the terms of the sentence he received, his probation was extended one year.

Indiana&#x27;s once promising post-season possibilities were marred by the suspension of starting small forward Ron Artest. Jackson averaged 18.9 points per game during the first round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs versus the Boston Celtics. A series loss in the next round at the hands of the Detroit Pistons ended their season, with Jackson leading the team in scoring during the playoffs with an average of 16.1 points per game.

In the 2005–06 NBA season, Jackson appeared in 81 games for the Pacers, averaging 16.4 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game. A notable exhibition of Jackson&#x27;s scoring ability came during a 31-point performance in a midseason victory over the Sacramento Kings, in which he made 3-pointers on four consecutive possessions. Jackson tied the Kings franchise record for the most 3-pointers in a quarter by an opponent. As the playoff push ensued, he tallied an average of 20.2 points per game in the month of April.

On October 6, 2006, Jackson and three other Pacers players had an argument with several patrons at Club Rio, a strip club in Indianapolis. Jackson was punched by one of the patrons and was hit by a car, rolling onto the hood. His injuries were minor. Jackson, who was on probation in Michigan after pleading no contest to misdemeanor assault and battery charges there for his part in a brawl, fired several gunshots from a 9-mm pistol, he asserted as an act of self-defense. However, prosecutors later said he fired first. Jackson was charged October 11, 2006, with a felony count of criminal recklessness, and misdemeanor counts of battery and disorderly conduct. He pled guilty to a felony count of criminal recklessness, received one year of probation, and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service. Because he had no prior felony convictions, he was eligible to receive misdemeanor sentencing despite pleading guilty to the felony. He served a seven-game suspension at the beginning of the 2007–08 NBA season as a Warrior for his legal problems.

===Golden State Warriors (2007–2009)===
On January 17, 2007, the Pacers dealt Jackson to the Golden State Warriors in a blockbuster eight player trade. Along with Al Harrington, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, and Josh Powell, Jackson was swapped for Mike Dunleavy, Troy Murphy, Ike Diogu, and Keith McLeod of the Warriors.

Jackson registered 29 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, and 5 steals in his Warriors debut, January 20, 2007, versus the Cleveland Cavaliers. On February 5, when Golden State traveled to Conseco Fieldhouse to compete against Jackson&#x27;s former team, he tallied 36 points and led the Warriors to a 113–98 victory over the Indiana Pacers. Jackson joined Vince Carter and Dominique Wilkins as the only players in 25 years to amass 30 or more points against a team that they played for earlier in the season.

In the Warriors 4–2 series victory over the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, Jackson garnered both positive and negative publicity. In what some consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Jackson was ejected from Games 2 and 5. The latter decision, in Game 5, was heavily criticized as Jackson appeared to be merely applauding at the end of the game to lift the spirits of his teammates, and not sarcastically at a referee. However, Jackson redeemed himself by playing well the entire series, especially in the series-clinching Game 6, where Jackson tallied 33 points on a then franchise playoff-record 7 three-pointers. This team playoff record has since been matched or exceeded 25 times by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.
Baron Davis, who suffered a slight hamstring injury in the 1st quarter of Game 6, shares his thoughts regarding Jackson: &quot;I told him (Stephen Jackson) I&#x27;ll give it all I got and I didn&#x27;t want to be the hardest worker out there. He had to carry me. He is the leader of this team and if you ask anyone on this team, he is the heart and soul of this team. He is a big-game performer and he knew just how important this game was. He is the only one on our team to have won a championship, so we had to feed off of him.&quot;
Jackson finished the series with per-game averages of 22.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 2.0 steals. In the Conference Semifinals, the Warriors were dispatched by a physical Utah Jazz team in 5 games. Jackson struggled due to the defensive tandem of Andrei Kirilenko and Matt Harpring and his offensive output decreased from the previous series.

Prior to the 2007–08 NBA season, Jackson (along with guard Baron Davis and forward Matt Barnes) was named a team captain of the Warriors. Jackson was the recipient of the NBA&#x27;s Western Conference Player of the Week award (November 26 – December 2), averaging 23.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 2.8 steals. Despite winning 48 games, the Warriors missed the playoffs in a Western Conference where all eight playoff teams won at least 50 games (Their 48 wins are the most of a team that did not qualify for playoffs in NBA history).

During the 2008–09 NBA season, Jackson registered three games of at least 30 points and 10 assists in a five-game span – the first NBA player to do so since LeBron James in 2007, and the first member of the Warriors since Tim Hardaway in 1992. He also tallied his first career triple double (30 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists) against the Phoenix Suns in the midst of this stretch, on February 4. On November 17, 2008, Jackson signed a three-year contract extension with the Warriors.

Jackson&#x27;s 2008–09 campaign effectively ended when he decided to determine the root cause of turf toe on his left foot, which had been ailing him for over 2 years. He underwent surgery on March 31, 2009, to remove multiple bone spurs above the nerve tissue under his big toe. His per-game season averages were 20.7 points, 5.1 rebounds, 6.5 assists (2nd only to LeBron James for forwards), 1.5 steals, and 39.6 minutes (2nd in the league, trailing only Joe Johnson of the Atlanta Hawks).

===Charlotte Bobcats (2009–2011)===
On November 16, 2009, Jackson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats along with Acie Law in exchange for Raja Bell and Vladimir Radmanović. Jackson set a Bobcats franchise record with 43 points scored versus the Houston Rockets, on January 12, 2010. The NBA recognized Jackson as the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Player of the Week on January 17, after he averaged 29.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 3.3 steals. In tandem with forward Gerald Wallace, Jackson led the Bobcats to the franchise&#x27;s first playoff appearance (culminating in a 4–0 series loss at the hands of the Orlando Magic). In league MVP voting, Jackson finished in 12th place, tied with Chris Bosh, Joe Johnson, and Chauncey Billups.

In the 2010-11 NBA season, Jackson recorded the first triple double (24 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists) in Bobcats team history versus the Phoenix Suns on November 20, 2010. However, Jackson failed to lead the Bobcats to the playoffs in 2011 and expressed disappointment with the team following a midseason trade of Gerald Wallace.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2011–2012)===
On June 23, 2011, after only two seasons with the Charlotte Bobcats, Jackson was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a three-way deal with the Sacramento Kings and Charlotte Bobcats. As part of the terms, the Milwaukee Bucks received Jackson, Shaun Livingston, the rights to the 19th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft, Tobias Harris from Charlotte, and Beno Udrih from Sacramento. Charlotte received Corey Maggette from Milwaukee and the rights to the 7th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, Bismack Biyombo, from Sacramento. Sacramento received John Salmons from Milwaukee and the rights to Jimmer Fredette, the 10th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.

Jackson&#x27;s brief stint with Milwaukee would be characterized by dysfunction and underwhelming play. Due to recurring issues with his hamstring throughout the lockout-extended offseason and several publicized clashes with coach Scott Skiles, Jackson&#x27;s role and playing time diminished. On March 13, 2012, Jackson was traded back to the Golden State Warriors along with Andrew Bogut, in exchange for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh, and Kwame Brown.

===Return to San Antonio (2012–2013)===
Without playing a game for the Warriors, Jackson was traded to the Spurs for Richard Jefferson, T. J. Ford and a conditional first-round pick on March 15, 2012. Due to the ascendant performance of rookie forward Kawhi Leonard, Jackson was a second-unit player for the first time in nearly 10 years. A re-adjustment period to San Antonio&#x27;s structured offensive system caused Jackson&#x27;s minutes to fluctuate in the regular season and playoffs.

The Spurs capped off an excellent regular season by reaching the Western Conference Playoffs as the highest seed. Ultimately, San Antonio lost 4 games to 2 to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. Jackson drew praise for his defensive efforts against league scoring champion Kevin Durant. In the elimination game of the series, Jackson connected on his first 6 three-point attempts. For the playoffs, Jackson shot 53.5% from the field, 60.5% from three-point range, and 93.3% from the free throw line.

On December 9, 2012, Jackson was fined $25,000 for threatening Serge Ibaka via Twitter. &quot;The recent public comments made by Stephen Jackson are absolutely unacceptable, cannot be tolerated, and do not reflect the standards held by the San Antonio Spurs,&quot; said Spurs general manager R.C. Buford. 

On April 12, 2013, Jackson was waived by the Spurs.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2013–2014)===
On December 10, 2013, he signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. Jackson struggled with the Clippers. In 9 games, he averaged a career-low 1.7 points per game, while shooting 23.1% from the field and 7.1% from three-point range. On January 7, 2014, he was waived by the Clippers.

===Retirement===
On July 22, 2015, Jackson announced his retirement. During his 14-year NBA career, Jackson earned more than $68.6 million in salary (excluding his stint with the Clippers in which his contract was not guaranteed).

==BIG3==
In 2017, Jackson joined the BIG3 basketball league, playing alongside Chauncey Billups and head coach Charles Oakley with the Killer 3s.

In 2021, he was named head coach of Trilogy, and led the team to back-to-back BIG3 Championships (2021–22).

==Player profile==
Jackson was an NBA swingman who was known to be a somewhat streaky outside shooter, but with scoring range that extended from the basket to the 3-point line. Despite spurts of inefficient, turnover-prone play, Jackson proved a capable playmaking option, with above-average passing abilities and court vision.

Larry Brown, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and former head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats, readily acknowledged Jackson&#x27;s ability: &quot;You ask anyone in the league – Stephen is an elite player. He&#x27;s as bright as anyone I&#x27;ve coached.&quot; Former Golden State Warriors head coach Don Nelson, the second most winning coach in NBA history, summarized Jackson&#x27;s game: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that people realize how good a player Jackson is, he guards every night, he makes plays, he can shoot, and the only thing that he doesn&#x27;t do is rebound. He makes everyone around him better.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s coach during his Indiana days, Rick Carlisle, described Jackson as a &quot;terrific all-around player... He&#x27;s an experienced guy, strong and quick. He has a good understanding of the game on the defensive side of the ball.&quot; NBA legend and former Pacers president Larry Bird called Jackson the toughest player in the league, regarding injuries and subsequently playing through the pain. Bird also praised Jackson&#x27;s ability to &quot;do every aspect of the game at a high level.&quot;
Theo Ratliff, a former Bobcats teammate, asserted that &quot;if he is not an All-Star in this league, I don&#x27;t know who is. It is time people recognize what he does on the floor.&quot;

Tim Duncan once labeled Jackson as the &quot;ultimate teammate&quot; during Jackson&#x27;s first stint in San Antonio. ESPN analyst and sportswriter Michael Smith finds Jackson to be &quot;articulate, charming, and thoughtful.&quot;

Marcus Thompson of the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; conveys his opinion as such: &quot;He takes the younger players under his wing, taking them shopping, dispensing advice, lending an ear. What&#x27;s more, he does the little things that are unbecoming of a millionaire. He looks people in the eye when they talk to him, as if he cares about what they&#x27;re saying. He frequently doles out handshakes, half-hugs and, to women, pecks on the cheek. He returns phone calls. He mends fences, lifts spirits, makes others feel special.&quot; Following a community outreach event, Gwen Knapp of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;[Jackson] couldn&#x27;t have been more charming or more engaged, the perfect face of the franchise.&quot;

Former coaches Rick Carlisle and Don Nelson have constantly referred to Jackson&#x27;s high character. During an appearance on the Jim Rome radio show, Nelson alluded to Jackson in a laudatory manner beyond the limited scope of the NBA. Former Pacers executive Donnie Walsh, who was principally responsible for the Golden State trade, stated &quot;I love Jack to death. He&#x27;s emotional and he&#x27;s going to get technicals. But that&#x27;s just part of the package. He&#x27;s a great team guy.&quot;

==Personal life==

Stemming from the two referenced incidents in 2004 and 2006, Jackson has pled guilty to felony criminal recklessness, and been charged with a number of misdemeanors, including assault, disorderly conduct, and two counts of battery.

On January 4, 2018, Jackson told TMZ, &quot;I smoked my whole career, had a hell of a career. Didn&#x27;t miss no games,&quot; when asked by a reporter if the NBA should remove marijuana from their banned substances list.

On July 7, 2020, Jackson defended Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson for posting an anti-Semitic post on Instagram, which included a quote falsely attributed to Adolf Hitler. After receiving criticism from Naismith Hall of Fame members such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Charles Barkley, Jackson apologized for his comments, saying that he &quot;used the wrong words&quot;.

On January 6, 2021, Jackson officially converted to Islam. Jackson stated in an interview that &quot;I can honestly say that there is no one who loves Allah more than me.&quot; He also stated that &quot;Everything I have today is because I get on my knees and pray five times a day. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wake up, breathe, and provide for my child, if I didn&#x27;t get on my knees and worship Allah. Allah is the one in control, and each and every one of us in creation are reliant on Allah in each and every moment. It is only when we realize this that this inner peace descends upon us. And that&#x27;s what Islam is about–Salaam–that peace.&quot;

In December 2011, under the alias Stak5, Jackson released a rap mixtape entitled &quot;What&#x27;s a Lockout?&quot;, hosted by DJ Scream of Maybach Music Group. The mixtape included guest appearances by various artists, including rapper Scarface.

Imani Showalter, Jackson&#x27;s ex-fiancée and mother of two of his children, was a cast member of the first season of &quot;Basketball Wives: LA&quot;, a reality show airing on American cable television network VH1.

===Activism and charity===
During his 7-game suspension to begin the 2007–08 NBA season, Jackson donated a significant portion of his time towards community service in the Oakland area, organizing several events geared mainly towards children. Additionally, during a game against the Toronto Raptors, Jackson paid tribute to forward Matt Barnes and his cancer-stricken mother by inscribing Barnes&#x27; 22 on his headband. Jackson also offered to delay his return from suspension if Barnes needed the support at home. Throughout his tenure in Golden State, Jackson attended Bible study with teammates such as Kelenna Azubuike, Al Harrington, and Brandan Wright. Pairing up with Southwest Airlines, Jackson and the Warriors organization arranged an essay contest for elementary school students from his hometown of Port Arthur, which gave 10 third-graders the opportunity to meet Jackson and receive tickets to the following night&#x27;s game.

The NBA recognized Jackson for his commitment to charity and presented him with the league&#x27;s Community Assist Award for March 2008. During the month, he participated in a Silence the Violence rally, teamed up with Grammy Award-winner John Legend to raise funds for the Show Me Campaign, participated in a groundbreaking for a basketball court, and launched his own foundation. In conjunction with the Good Tidings Foundation, Jackson unveiled the Stephen Jackson Basketball Court at Omega Boys Club in San Francisco, California on April 11, 2008. Additionally, in honor of Jackson&#x27;s continued commitment to the Bay Area community, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom proclaimed Saturday, April 12, 2008 – the day after the unveiling – as Stephen Jackson Day.

Jackson established the Stephen Jackson Academy of Art, Science, and Technology in the summer of 2008 in Port Arthur. New construction for the school was completed in 2009; as of 2012, the academy offered after-school programs for local children and houses a gymnasium for public use. In order to pursue educational accreditation, Jackson planned to expand the academy. Jackson hoped construction commence by the end of 2012. but in 2018 Jackson stated he would be selling the academy after expressing his frustration that the city had not matched his investment in the gym. Additionally, they offered no support for his goal of establishing an elementary school.

Jackson was a close friend of George Floyd, who drew international attention when he was killed by police in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Jackson received media attention for an impassioned speech he gave at a protest rally in Minnesota. In it, he stated, &quot;I&#x27;m here because they&#x27;re not gonna demean the character of George Floyd, my twin.&quot; Jackson and Floyd called each other &quot;Twin&quot; due to their similar physical appearance.

Jackson described himself as inspired by Malcolm X, who is described as &quot;the biggest reason for the continuation of Islam in the African-American community.&quot; Jackson stated, &quot;Every black man is influenced by Malcolm X. When you are growing up and hear the story of Malcolm X, you are influenced by Malcolm X, and by Islam, in some type of way. For me, I am of course influenced by Malcolm X. It is impossible for me not to be...I do not see myself just following him. I want to be greater than Malcolm X. Even when I say that, it might be damn near impossible, because the man was so special. Malcolm X was so special. I strive to be like him or even better than him. And for you to say that he is the most respected American Muslim ever, I strive to be that. I plan to be that.&quot;

<text>St Dunstan-in-the-East was a Church of England parish church on St Dunstan&#x27;s Hill, halfway between London Bridge and the Tower of London in the City of London. The church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and the ruins are now a public garden maintained by the City of London Corporation.

==History==

The church was originally built in about 1100. A new south aisle was added in 1391 and the church was repaired in 1631 at a cost of more than £2,400.

It was severely damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Rather than being completely rebuilt, the damaged church was patched up between 1668 and 1671. A steeple was added in 1695–1701 to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren.
It was built in a gothic style sympathetic to the main body of the church, though with heavy string courses of a kind not used in the Middle Ages. It has a needle spire carried on four flying buttresses in the manner of that of St Nicholas in Newcastle. The restored church had wooden carvings by Grinling Gibbons and an organ by Father Smith, which was transferred to the abbey at St Albans in 1818.

In 1817 it was found that the weight of the nave roof had thrust the walls seven inches out of the perpendicular. It was decided to rebuild the church from the level of the arches, but the state of the structure proved so bad that the whole building was taken down. It was rebuilt to a design in the perpendicular style by David Laing (then architect to the Board of Customs) with assistance from William Tite. The foundation stone was laid in November 1817 and the church re-opened for worship in January 1821. Built of Portland stone, with a plaster lierne nave vault, it was 115 feet long and 65 feet wide and could accommodate between six and seven hundred people. The cost of the work was £36,000. Wren&#x27;s tower was retained in the new building.

The church was severely damaged in the Blitz of 1941. Wren&#x27;s tower and steeple survived the bombs&#x27; impact. Of the rest of the church only the north and south walls remained. In the re-organisation of the Anglican Church in London following the War it was decided not to rebuild St Dunstan&#x27;s, and in 1967 the City of London Corporation decided to turn the ruins of the church into a public garden, which opened in 1971. A lawn and trees were planted in the ruins, with a low fountain in the middle of the nave. The tower now houses the All Hallows House Foundation.
The parish is now combined with the Benefice of All Hallows by the Tower and occasional open-air services are held in the church, such as on Palm Sunday prior to a procession to All Hallows by the Tower along St Dunstan&#x27;s Hill and Great Tower Street. The ruin was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

<text>Charlotte Jane Uhlenbroek (born 16 May 1967) is a British zoologist and BBC television presenter.

==Early life==
Her Dutch father was an agricultural specialist with the United Nations who took his English wife and their family round the world with him. Uhlenbroek was born in London, but her parents moved to Ghana when she was only ten days old. Between the ages of 5–14 she lived in Kathmandu, Nepal.

==Education and scientific work==
Uhlenbroek attended Oakham School in Rutland, and then gained a BSc in Zoology and Psychology in 1988, followed in 1997 by a PhD in Zoology, at the University of Bristol. She spent six months in Burundi helping primatologist Jane Goodall set up a conservation project for chimpanzees, followed by four years in the forests of Gombe Stream National Park in Western Tanzania on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, studying the communication of wild chimpanzees. In 2007, Uhlenbroek was awarded an honorary degree from Oxford Brookes University for her work.

==Television career==
Spotted by the BBC Natural History Unit, Uhlenbroek made her UK television debut in the series &quot;Dawn to Dusk,&quot; presented by Jonathan Scott, in an episode on the chimpanzees of Gombe Stream National Park. She went on to present the BBC Two programme &quot;Chimpanzee Diary&quot; as part of the &quot;Animal Zone&quot; during 1998 and 1999. Uhlenbroek subsequently presented a number of documentaries (both series and one-off programmes) for the BBC, including: &quot;Cousins&quot; (2000), &quot;Congo&#x27;s Secret Chimps&quot; (2001), &quot;Talking with Animals&quot; (2002), &quot;Jungle&quot; (2003), &quot;Secret Gorillas of Mondika&quot; (2005). In 2004, she was one of the subjects of the short documentary series &quot;The Way We Went Wild&quot;, about television&#x27;s natural history presenters.

Uhlenbroek visited the Mefou National Park in Cameroon in 2006 to provide narration for Animal Planet&#x27;s Going Ape TV series, based on the charity Ape Action Africa.

In 2007, she presented Safari School, a twenty-part BBC 2 &quot;reality&quot; series in which eight celebrities had to learn to become game rangers at the Shamwari Game Reserve. In 2009 she was associate producer for and presented &quot;Among the Apes&quot;, a four-part series on Five, each part concerning a different primate species.

In recent years she has made minor appearances on BBC nature programmes, written about elephant conservation in the Daily Mail and been involved with several conservation charities.

===Synopsis===
==Personal life==
Since 2006, she has been married to Daniel Rees, who works as a producer for the BBC Natural History Unit.

Uhlenbroek supports Animal Aid and their campaign against primate experiments, stating: &quot;I have yet to hear a sufficiently compelling scientific argument that justifies the suffering inflicted on primates in medical research.&quot; She is also a supporter of many animal-orientated charities, including Ape Action Africa, Fauna and Flora International, For Life On Earth the Great Apes Survival Project, the Kathmandu Animal Treatment Centre and Compassion in World Farming.

<text>The 1935 South American Championship was the thirteenth edition of the football tournament, held from 6–27 January 1935 in Lima, Peru, used for Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay to qualify for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay withdrew from the tournament.

There was some doubt the tournament would take place as during the 1930 FIFA World Cup, where Uruguay defeated Argentina, 4–2 in the final match, Argentina broke off football relations with their Uruguayan counterparts, claiming to have been heavily pressured, and that aggressions had been directed at them, before and during the tournament.

Six years after the previous edition, it was decided to continue the tournament. The tournament itself did not have a trophy in dispute.

<text>Raymond Aker (March 10, 1920 – January 4, 2003) was a U.S. historian who was noted as an authority on the voyages of Francis Drake in the late 16th century. Aker served as president of the Drake Navigators Guild in California, which promotes Drake and his explorations. It was the work of Aker that helped ensure that Drake received credit for the discovery of Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America.

==Biography==
Aker was born in Yonkers, New York and grew up in Atherton, California. He was interested in sailing from an early age, and developed a hobby of making models and paintings of ships. He continued this hobby throughout his life, making detailed drawings and models of ships.

At age nineteen in 1939, he enrolled in the California Nautical School. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, his class was graduated early in 1942 class. Aker become a deck officer on troop transport ships with Matson Lines. After World War II, he worked for 29 years at Westinghouse on projects that include the Polaris missile and ship propeller design.

He also continued to develop his skills as a navigator and mariner. He developed a fascination with Drake and used his own nautical skills to reconstruct Drake&#x27;s 1577–1580 circumnavigation of the globe, during which Drake landed on the west coast of North America and founded a temporary colony of New Albion at a still undetermined spot, possibly in Northern California. Like many in the Drake Navigators Guild, Aker was a proponent of the theory that Drake landed at what is now called Drakes Bay in Marin County, California, north of San Francisco. To support his theory, Aker spent many years analyzing the variation in the tides in the cove called Drakes Estero. Critics of the Drakes Estero theory have maintained that the geography of the cove does not match the descriptions in the journals of those on the voyage, or the map made from voyage accounts by Jodocus Hondius. Aker maintained that the cove geography was cyclic over decades, and in 2001 he correctly predicted the reemergence of a spit in the cove which he claimed closely matched the contemporary accounts of Drake&#x27;s landing spot. He led a longtime effort to lobby the National Park Service to designate Drakes Bay as a National Historic Landmark. That effort came to fruition in 2012 with the establishment of the Drakes Bay Historic and Archaeological District National Historic Landmark.

As part of his study of Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation, Aker became convinced that Drake was the true discoverer of Cape Horn, rather than Dutch explorer Willem Schouten, who was thought to have discovered it in 1616. Most historians at the time believed that Drake landed on Henderson Island northwest of Cape Horn. In 1997 the American National Maritime Historical Society accepted Aker&#x27;s argument that it Drake who first discovered Cape Horn. The argument was also accepted by the National Geographic Society.

Aker also became convinced that the partial remains of Drake&#x27;s ship the &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, are buried at the old Deptford Navy Yard along the Thames in east London.

<doc id="1194822" wikidata="Q16821185" url="?curid=1194822" title="Invasive species in New Zealand">
<text>A number of introduced species, some of which have become invasive species, have been added to New Zealand&#x27;s native flora and fauna. Both deliberate and accidental introductions have been made from the time of the first human settlement, with several waves of Polynesian people at some time before the year 1300, followed by Europeans after 1769.

Almost without exception, the introduced species have been detrimental to the native flora and fauna, but some, such as farmed sheep and cows and the clover upon which they feed, now form a large part of the economy of New Zealand. Possibility of introduced herbivores (deer) to serve as ecological proxies for extinct moa has been questioned.

Biosecurity New Zealand maintains registers and lists of species that are invasive, potentially invasive, or a threat to agriculture or biodiversity. They also manage a small number of species under the National Interest Pest Responses (NIPR) programme. The rainbow lorikeet is the one animal that has been covered by the NIPR, and was eradicated in 2014. All the other species covered by the NIPR, past or present, are weeds.

==Animal species==

Many invasive animal species are listed in schedules 5 and 6 of the Wildlife Act 1953. Those in Schedule 5 have no protection and may be killed. Those in Schedule 6 are declared to be noxious animals and subject to the Wild Animal Control Act 1977. In 2016 the New Zealand government introduced Predator Free 2050, a project to eliminate all non-native predators (such as rats, possums and stoats) by 2050.

Some of the invasive animal species are as follows.

:*&quot;Philoponella congregabilis&quot;
:*The redback, &quot;Latrodectus hasselti&quot;, thought to have arrived with a steel shipment in the 1980s
==Plant and other non-animal species==
The National Pest Plant Accord, with a listing of about 120 genus, species, hybrids and subspecies, was developed to limit the spread of plant pests. Invasive plants are classified as such on a regional basis with some plants declared as national plant pests. Biosecurity New Zealand manages a small number of weeds under the National Interest Pest Responses programme. As of May 2024, NIPR covers nine weeds. Hornwort (&quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot;) was covered until it was eradicated in 2014. Additionally, the Department of Conservation lists 328 vascular plant species as environmental weeds.

Some of the better-known invasive plant species are:

*&quot;Acacia&quot; species (mostly Australian) especially wattle
*&quot;Acanthus&quot; - bear&#x27;s breeches
*&quot;Agapanthus&quot;
*Arrowhead (&quot;Sagittaria sagittifolia&quot;)

<text>Cassiar is a ghost town in British Columbia, Canada. It was a small company-owned asbestos mining town located in the Cassiar Mountains of Northern British Columbia north of Dease Lake.

==History==
The discovery of asbestos in the area in 1950 led to the founding of the Cassiar Asbestos Company in the following year. The town was established in 1952, the same year the mining operation began. By the 1970s, Cassiar had a population of 1,500 and had two schools, two churches, a small hospital, theatre, swimming pool, recreation centre and a hockey rink.

By the early 1990s, diminished demand for asbestos and expensive complications faced after converting from an open-pit mine to an underground mine made the continued operation of the mine unprofitable. In 1992, Cassiar Asbestos decided to close the mine and liquidate its assets, including the town of Cassiar itself.

Most of the contents of the town, including a few houses, were auctioned off and trucked away. Most of the remaining dwellings were bulldozed and burned to the ground. The mill was briefly reactivated in 1999 by Cassiar Chrysotile Inc which had a reclamation permit to clean up the site. 11,000 tons of asbestos were exported before the mill burned down on Christmas Day of 2000, effectively halting all production. Today the streets are bare and flowers bloom where the houses once stood. Residents living between the townsite and the Stewart-Cassiar Highway, and on the highway itself, who originally obtained phone service from the Cassiar exchange, were moved to the nearby Good Hope Lake exchange in the fall of 2006 and the Cassiar exchange shut down.

Neglected and in disrepair, the hockey arena collapsed in 2008, with the church following in 2015. The tramline which transported ore from the mine down the mountainside to the mill was purchased in the auction; however, the buyer left it, and it still stands.

The four old apartment blocks at the east end of town are operational for ongoing site reclamation work. As of November 2006, they were being used by mining exploration companies conducting underground gold mining at Table Mountain (formerly Erickson Gold) and base metal exploration in the immediate area. There was also seasonal jade mining from the Cassiar waste dumps.

==Climate==
Cassiar has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, cold, and snowy winters and short, cool summers.

<doc id="1194838" wikidata="Q125481" url="?curid=1194838" title="Bishops' House">
<text>Bishops&#x27; House is a half-timbered house in the Norton Lees district of the City of Sheffield, England. It was built and is located on the southern tip of Meersbrook Park. It is one of the three surviving timber-framed houses in the city (the others being the Old Queen&#x27;s Head and Broom Hall).

It is known as Bishops&#x27; House because it was said to have been built for two brothers, John and Geoffrey Blythe, both of whom became Bishops. There is, however, no evidence that they ever lived in this house—the first known resident is William Blythe, a farmer and scythe manufacturer, who was living here in 1627.

Samuel Blyth was the last of the family to live in the house, dying in 1753, after which his sons sold the house to a William Shore. The Blyth family subsequently moved to Birmingham. Notable descendants were Benjamin Blyth, Sir Arthur Blyth and Benjamin Blyth II. The house was subsequently let to a tenant farmer and his labourer, at which point the house was sub-divided into two dwellings.

In 1886 ownership passed to the Corporation (Sheffield City Council) and various recreation department employees lived in the house until 1974.

It is a Grade II* listed building and has been open as a museum since 1976, following a renovation funded by English Heritage and Sheffield City Council. The Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust managed the building for some years until April 2011, when management of public opening, on behalf of the building&#x27;s owner Sheffield City Council, was conferred to the Friends of Bishops&#x27; House. The building is open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays between 10am and 4pm. In April 2012 Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust stopped providing educational visits and the Friends of Bishops&#x27; House began opening the house to schools also. The displays in the house have had some recent small changes but are still curated by Museums Sheffield. The Friends of Bishops&#x27; House is a registered charity and limited company, run entirely by volunteers. The house contains exhibitions on life in the 16th and 17th centuries with two rooms decorated in Jacobean style.

The building is featured on the cover of local band Monkey Swallows the Universe&#x27;s second album &quot;The Casket Letters&quot;.

<text>Thomas Ankersmit (born 1979, Leiden, Netherlands) is a musician and installation artist based in Berlin and Amsterdam.

His main instrument, both live and in the studio, is the Serge analogue modular synthesizer.

Physical and psychoacoustic phenomena such as sound reflections, infrasonic vibration, otoacoustic emissions, and highly directional projections of sound have been an important part of his work since the early 2000s.
His electronic music is also characterized by a deliberate misuse of the equipment, using feedback and disruptions in the signal to create many of the sounds.

Ankersmit frequently collaborates with New York-based minimalist composer Phill Niblock, electroacoustic improviser Valerio Tricoli and noise artist Kevin Drumm.

During the first ten years of his activities, Ankersmit focussed almost exclusively on live performance and installation work. 
Since 2010, his music has been released on the PAN, Touch and Ash International labels.

<doc id="1194850" wikidata="Q1912057" url="?curid=1194850" title="Baramulla district">
<text>Baramulla district (or Varmul, in Kashmiri) is one of the 20 districts in the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K) in the disputed Kashmir region. Baramulla town is the administrative headquarters of this district. The district covered an area of in 2001, but it was reduced to at the time of 2011 census. In 2016, the district administration said that the area was . Muslims constitute about 98% of the population.

==Etymology==
The name Baramulla, meaning &quot;Boar&#x27;s Molar Place,&quot; is derived from two Sanskrit words &quot;Varaha&quot; (Boar) and &quot;Mula&quot;. According to Hindu texts, the Kashmir Valley was once a lake called &quot;Satisaras,&quot; the lake of Parvati (consort of Shiva). Hindu texts state that the lake was occupied by a demon, Jalodbhava, until Lord Vishnu assumed the form of a boar and struck the mountain with his molar at Baramulla (ancient Varahamula). He bored an opening in it where the lake water flowed out.

==History==
===Ancient and medieval===
The city of Baramulla, from which the district derives its name, was founded by Raja Bhimsina in 2306 BCE. A number of prominent visitors have travelled to Baramulla. These include the Chinese visitor Heiun T&#x27;Sang and the British historian, Moorcraft. Mughal emperors had a special fascination for Baramulla. As the gateway of the Kashmir Valley, Baramulla was a stopping place for them during their visits to the valley. Jahangir also stayed at Baramulla during his visit to Kashmir in 1620 CE.

From the very beginning, Baramulla has been a religious center. The construction of Hindu Teerth and Buddhist Vihars made the city sacred to people of both religions. In the 15th century, the noted Muslim saint, Syed Janbaz Wali, visited the valley along with his companions in 1421 CE. He chose Baramulla as the centre of his mission and was buried here after death. His shrine attracts pilgrims from all over the Valley. In 1620, the sixth Sikh Guru Shri Hargobind visited the city. Baramulla thus became an abode of Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and Sikhs living in harmony and contributing to a rich composite culture.

It was the oldest and the most important town in the north of princely state of Kashmir and Jammu. In the later centuries, until 27 October 1947, it was the &#x27;Gateway of Kashmir Valley&#x27; by the Rawalpindi-Murree-Muzaffarabad-Baramulla Road. It became a part of Union of India when the Maharaja, under duress of invasion by Pakistani tribal forces, signed the instrument of accession on 26 October 1947, which was accepted by India the next day.
Actual area of district Baramulla according to 2018 survey by the centre for remote sensing and gis is 2204.06 km2.

=== Pakistani tribal invasion (1947) ===

After the Partition of India in 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh chose to remain independent, not joining either India or Pakistan. A large number of tribals from Pakistan attacked Kashmir under the code name &quot;Operation Gulmarg,&quot; intending to seize Kashmir. The invading tribals started moving along Rawalpindi-Murree-Muzaffarabad-Baramulla Road on 22 October 1947 with Pakistani army men in plain clothes. Muzaffarabad fell on 24 October 1947. They reached and captured Baramulla on 25 October. There they stayed for several days looting, raping, and killing residents; burning and plundering homes and businesses; and desecrating and vandalising shrines and temples. They could have reached Srinagar, just 50 km away, and captured its airfield, which was not defended at all. They raped and killed European nuns (only one survived) at Baramulla&#x27;s St. Joseph convent and Christian nurses at the missionary hospital. This looting, raping, murder and abduction of girls continued for several days. It is said that the suffering of Baramulla saved the rest of Kashmir, because airplanes carrying Indian troops airlifted from Delhi on the morning of 27 October could land at Srinagar airfield while the invaders were still at Baramulla.

Charles Chevenix Trench writes in his &quot;The Frontier Scouts&quot; (1985):
In October 1947... tribal lashkars hastened in lorries - undoubtedly with official logistic support - into Kashmir... at least one British Officer, Harvey-Kelly took part in the campaign. It seemed that nothing could stop these hordes of tribesmen taking Srinagar with its vital airfield. Indeed nothing did, but their own greed. The Mahsuds in particular stopped to loot, rape and murder; Indian troops were flown in and the lashkars pushed out of the Vale of Kashmir into the mountains. The Mahsuds returned home in a savage mood, having muffed an easy chance, lost the loot of Srinagar and made fools of themselves.

Tom Cooper of Air Combat Information Group wrote:
...the Pathans appeared foremost interested in looting, killing, ransacking and other crimes against the inhabitants instead of a serious military action.

Biju Patnaik (who later became Chief Minister of Odisha) piloted the first plane to land at Srinagar airport that morning. He brought 17 soldiers of 1-Sikh regiment commanded by Lt. Col. Dewan Ranjit Rai.
&quot;...The pilot flew low on the airstrip twice to ensure that no raiders were around... Instructions from PM Nehru’s office were clear: If the airport was taken over by the enemy, you are not to land. Taking a full circle the DC-3 flew ground level. Anxious eye-balls peered from inside the aircraft – only to find the airstrip empty. Nary a soul was in sight. The raiders were busy distributing the war booty amongst them in Baramulla.&quot;

In the words of Gen Mohammad Akbar Khan (Brigadier-in-Charge, Pakistan, in his book &quot;War for Kashmir in 1947&quot;): &quot;The uncouth raiders delayed in Baramulla for two (whole) days for some unknown reason.&quot;

It took two weeks for the Indian army to evict the raiders from Baramulla. Joined by Pakistani regular troops, they had become well-entrenched.

Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah spoke in the UN Security Council on 5 February 1948 thus: &quot;...the raiders came to our land, massacred thousands of people — mostly Hindus and Sikhs, but Muslims, too — abducted thousands of girls, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims alike, looted our property and almost reached the gates of our summer capital, Srinagar...&quot;

===Recent years===
Roads have been improved and road network has grown considerably in Baramulla town since 1947. New schools and colleges have started and better facilities for education have been created. More bridges on Jhelum river have been constructed or planned to connect the old town on the north bank of the river with the new town on the south bank. Decongestion of the old town has been attempted by moving some residents to houses in the new town.

The most recent development has been creation of railway connectivity with Srinagar, Anantnag and Qazigund and the planned connectivity with Banihal and Jammu.

<doc id="1194851" wikidata="Q7117369" url="?curid=1194851" title="P. K. Srinivasan">
<text>P.K. Srinivasan (PKS) (4 November 1924 – 20 June 2005) was a well known mathematics teacher in Chennai, India. He taught mathematics at the Muthialpet High School in Chennai, India until his retirement. His singular dedication to education of mathematics would bring him to the United States, where he worked for a year, and then to Nigeria, where he would work for six years. He is known in India for his dedication to teaching mathematics and in creating pioneering awareness of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. He has authored several books in English, Telugu and Tamil that introduce mathematics to children in novel and interesting ways. He was also a prominent reviewer of math books in the weekly &quot;Book Review&quot; column of the Indian newspaper The Hindu in Chennai.

== Experience ==

PKS, as he was known to the world-at-large, among his colleagues, students and friends, travelled to the United States as a Fulbright exchange teacher and worked in Liverpool Central School, New York, in 1965-&#x27;66. Later he served as a Senior education officer and a Senior lecturer in mathematics in Nigeria for six years. He served as a lecturer in the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in India. He organized over sixty math expositions and fairs in India, Nigeria and the United States, and participated actively in four International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME) conferences.

He inspired many a creative idea and gave them shape through demonstrative displays by his students. Conduct of Bharat Dharshan, World Exhibition, three-day three-tier Math Expositions to make all his math students walk across the curriculum which was highly talked about in his days and research papers on subjects from English to Social Studies by students studying from 7 to 12 Standards was an everlasting contribution made by him to the students and to The Muthialpet High School, Chennai where he was a teacher par excellence.

He could pick the brightest of students and discuss esoteric topics such as Boolean algebra, Ramanujan&#x27;s theorems and at same time deploy easy-to-understand teaching tools for teaching mathematics and English. As a class teacher, he could reach across to the poorest performers and made them cross average levels in English and mathematics.

Although he hailed from a traditional family, he was always clad in a white &quot;kurta&quot; and &quot;dhoti&quot; spun out of &quot;khadi&quot; - rough and homespun cotton cloth that symbolized the Swadeshi concept of Gandhiji. He sported a Gandhian cap as well.

His vision and unquenchable thirst for knowledge transcended the narrow barriers of caste, language and religion. Personal and family interests always took a backseat in his mission for spreading knowledge and awareness and imparting a sense of purpose in his students to go beyond the narrow frontiers of a syllabus-oriented formal education to exploration of the unfathomable depths of knowledge. He displayed the same missionary zeal in making classroom education and teaching of English and mathematics in particular a matter of fun and curiosity among the low-mark scoring students as well.

In addition, he was the founder and the curator-director of Ramanujan Museum &amp; Math Education Centre which he helped establish in 1993. He was also one of the founders of the Association of Mathematics Teachers of India (AMTI) in 1965.

== Honours ==

He was awarded the National Science Award by the Government of India in 1991 and a State Award by the Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre for popularisation of mathematics education to enable children to learn mathematics with interest and enthusiasm.

== Philosophy ==

He advocated the use of no cost teaching aids and no cost, no material teaching aids, improvising them to illustrate mathematical concepts whenever they are introduced and almost lead a crusade against the mere rote learning techniques and drill. He also indicated the efficacy of introducing non-routine thinking when the child can grasp, using the concepts introduced, leading to problem solving techniques and innovative strategies.

== Memorial Meeting ==

A meeting to pay homage to his memory was organised on 8 July 2005 by Mr N Ravi of Hindu Newspaper and his son Kannan Srinivasan in the Dakshinamoorthy auditorium of the P.S. Higher Secondary School in Mylapore, Chennai. Many speakers who were his associates, admirers, friends and relatives spoke of the momentum he brought to the movement of mathematics education in the country. It was mentioned by more than one speaker at that time that the best tribute to his memory would be for mathematics teachers to make mathematics learning interesting for the children.

==Memorial==

A commemorative website was created, for a short while (no longer actively maintained, as of 2012) by his immediate family.
P.K. Srinivasan is survived by his wife, five sons, and five daughters. P.K. Srinivasan&#x27;s obituary was published in the newspaper The Hindu.

* 

== Personal ==

P.K. Srinivasan was the strict father of ten children, but most of his professional colleagues did not know he had such a large family. His wife, Alamelu Srinivasan, has been credited with bringing up their children almost single-handedly. She died in Chennai on 10 November 2012.

<doc id="1194858" wikidata="Q1156047" url="?curid=1194858" title="Rope (data structure)">
<text>In computer programming, a rope, or cord, is a data structure composed of smaller strings that is used to efficiently store and manipulate longer strings or entire texts. For example, a text editing program may use a rope to represent the text being edited, so that operations such as insertion, deletion, and random access can be done efficiently.

==Description==
A rope is a type of binary tree where each leaf (end node) holds a string of manageable size and length (also known as a &quot;weight&quot;), and each node further up the tree holds the sum of the lengths of all the leaves in its left subtree. A node with two children thus divides the whole string into two parts: the left subtree stores the first part of the string, the right subtree stores the second part of the string, and a node&#x27;s weight is the length of the first part.

For rope operations, the strings stored in nodes are assumed to be constant immutable objects in the typical nondestructive case, allowing for some copy-on-write behavior. Leaf nodes are usually implemented as basic fixed-length strings with a reference count attached for deallocation when no longer needed, although other garbage collection methods can be used as well.

==Operations==
In the following definitions, &quot;N&quot; is the length of the rope, that is, the weight of the root node.

=== Collect leaves ===
: &quot;Definition:&quot; Create a stack &quot;S&quot; and a list &quot;L&quot;. Traverse down the left-most spine of the tree until you reach a leaf l&#x27;, adding each node &quot;n&quot; to &quot;S&quot;. Add l&#x27; to &quot;L&quot;. The parent of l&#x27; (&quot;p&quot;) is at the top of the stack. Repeat the procedure for p&#x27;s right subtree.
final class InOrderRopeIterator implements Iterator&lt;RopeLike&gt; {

 private final Deque&lt;RopeLike&gt; stack;

 InOrderRopeIterator(@NonNull RopeLike root) {
 stack = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();
 var c = root;
 while (c != null) {
 stack.push(c);
 c = c.getLeft();
 }

 @Override
 public boolean hasNext() {
 return stack.size() &gt; 0;

 @Override
 public RopeLike next() {
 val result = stack.pop();

 if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
 var parent = stack.pop();
 var right = parent.getRight();
 if (right != null) {
 stack.push(right);
 var cleft = right.getLeft();
 while (cleft != null) {
 stack.push(cleft);
 cleft = cleft.getLeft();
 }

 return result;
}
=== Rebalance ===
: &quot;Definition:&quot; Collect the set of leaves &quot;L&quot; and rebuild the tree from the bottom-up.
static boolean isBalanced(RopeLike r) {
 val depth = r.depth();
 if (depth &gt;= FIBONACCI_SEQUENCE.length - 2) {
 return false;
 return FIBONACCI_SEQUENCE[depth + 2] &lt;= r.weight();

static RopeLike rebalance(RopeLike r) {
 if (!isBalanced(r)) {
 val leaves = Ropes.collectLeaves(r);
 return merge(leaves, 0, leaves.size());
 return r;

static RopeLike merge(List&lt;RopeLike&gt; leaves) {
 return merge(leaves, 0, leaves.size());

static RopeLike merge(List&lt;RopeLike&gt; leaves, int start, int end) {
 int range = end - start;
 if (range == 1) {
 return leaves.get(start);
 if (range == 2) {
 return new RopeLikeTree(leaves.get(start), leaves.get(start + 1));
 int mid = start + (range / 2);
 return new RopeLikeTree(merge(leaves, start, mid), merge(leaves, mid, end));


=== Insert ===
: &quot;Definition:&quot; codice_1: insert the string &quot;S’&quot; beginning at position &quot;i&quot; in the string &quot;s&quot;, to form a new string .
: &quot;Time complexity:&quot; .

This operation can be done by a codice_2 and two codice_3 operations. The cost is the sum of the three.

public Rope insert(int idx, CharSequence sequence) {
 if (idx == 0) {
 return prepend(sequence);
 if (idx == length()) {
 return append(sequence);
 val lhs = base.split(idx);
 return new Rope(Ropes.concat(lhs.fst.append(sequence), lhs.snd));

=== Index ===

: &quot;Definition:&quot; codice_4: return the character at position &quot;i&quot;
: &quot;Time complexity:&quot; 

To retrieve the &quot;i&quot;-th character, we begin a recursive search from the root node:
@Override
public int indexOf(char ch, int startIndex) {
 if (startIndex &gt; weight) {
 return right.indexOf(ch, startIndex - weight);
 return left.indexOf(ch, startIndex);


For example, to find the character at in Figure 2.1 shown on the right, start at the root node (A), find that 22 is greater than 10 and there is a left child, so go to the left child (B). 9 is less than 10, so subtract 9 from 10 (leaving ) and go to the right child (D). Then because 6 is greater than 1 and there&#x27;s a left child, go to the left child (G). 2 is greater than 1 and there&#x27;s a left child, so go to the left child again (J). Finally 2 is greater than 1 but there is no left child, so the character at index 1 of the short string &quot;na&quot; (ie &quot;n&quot;) is the answer. (1-based index)

=== Concat ===

: &quot;Definition:&quot; codice_5: concatenate two ropes, &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2, into a single rope.
: &quot;Time complexity:&quot; (or time to compute the root weight)

A concatenation can be performed simply by creating a new root node with and , which is constant time. The weight of the parent node is set to the length of the left child &quot;S&quot;1, which would take time, if the tree is balanced.

As most rope operations require balanced trees, the tree may need to be re-balanced after concatenation.

=== Split ===
: &quot;Definition:&quot; codice_6: split the string &quot;S&quot; into two new strings &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2, and .
: &quot;Time complexity:&quot; 

There are two cases that must be dealt with:
# The split point is at the end of a string (i.e. after the last character of a leaf node)
# The split point is in the middle of a string.

The second case reduces to the first by splitting the string at the split point to create two new leaf nodes, then creating a new node that is the parent of the two component strings.

For example, to split the 22-character rope pictured in Figure 2.3 into two equal component ropes of length 11, query the 12th character to locate the node &quot;K&quot; at the bottom level. Remove the link between &quot;K&quot; and &quot;G&quot;. Go to the parent of &quot;G&quot; and subtract the weight of &quot;K&quot; from the weight of &quot;D&quot;. Travel up the tree and remove any right links to subtrees covering characters past position 11, subtracting the weight of &quot;K&quot; from their parent nodes (only node &quot;D&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, in this case). Finally, build up the newly orphaned nodes &quot;K&quot; and &quot;H&quot; by concatenating them together and creating a new parent &quot;P&quot; with weight equal to the length of the left node &quot;K&quot;.

As most rope operations require balanced trees, the tree may need to be re-balanced after splitting.
public Pair&lt;RopeLike, RopeLike&gt; split(int index) {
 if (index &lt; weight) {
 val split = left.split(index);
 return Pair.of(rebalance(split.fst), rebalance(new RopeLikeTree(split.snd, right)));
 } else if (index &gt; weight) {
 val split = right.split(index - weight);
 return Pair.of(rebalance(new RopeLikeTree(left, split.fst)), rebalance(split.snd));
 } else {
 return Pair.of(left, right);
}
=== Delete ===
: &quot;Definition:&quot; codice_7: delete the substring , from &quot;s&quot; to form a new string .
: &quot;Time complexity:&quot; .

This operation can be done by two codice_2 and one codice_3 operation. First, split the rope in three, divided by &quot;i&quot;-th and &quot;i+j&quot;-th character respectively, which extracts the string to delete in a separate node. Then concatenate the other two nodes.
@Override
public RopeLike delete(int start, int length) {
 val lhs = split(start);
 val rhs = split(start + length);
 return rebalance(new RopeLikeTree(lhs.fst, rhs.snd));


=== Report ===
: &quot;Definition:&quot; codice_10: output the string .
: &quot;Time complexity:&quot; 

To report the string , find the node &quot;u&quot; that contains &quot;Ci&quot; and , and then traverse &quot;T&quot; starting at node &quot;u&quot;. Output by doing an in-order traversal of &quot;T&quot; starting at node &quot;u&quot;.

==Comparison with monolithic arrays==
Advantages:
* Ropes enable much faster insertion and deletion of text than monolithic string arrays, on which operations have time complexity O(n).
* Ropes do not require O(n) extra memory when operated upon (arrays need that for copying operations).
* Ropes do not require large contiguous memory spaces.
* If only nondestructive versions of operations are used, rope is a persistent data structure. For the text editing program example, this leads to an easy support for multiple undo levels.

Disadvantages:
* Greater overall space use when not being operated on, mainly to store parent nodes. There is a trade-off between how much of the total memory is such overhead and how long pieces of data are being processed as strings. The strings in example figures above are unrealistically short for modern architectures. The overhead is always O(n), but the constant can be made arbitrarily small.
* Increase in time to manage the extra storage
* Increased complexity of source code; greater risk of bugs

This table compares the &quot;algorithmic&quot; traits of string and rope implementations, not their &quot;raw speed&quot;. Array-based strings have smaller overhead, so (for example) concatenation and split operations are faster on small datasets. However, when array-based strings are used for longer strings, time complexity and memory use for inserting and deleting characters becomes unacceptably large. In contrast, a rope data structure has stable performance regardless of data size. Further, the space complexity for ropes and arrays are both O(n). In summary, ropes are preferable when the data is large and modified often.

<doc id="1194861" wikidata="Q5319022" url="?curid=1194861" title="Dynamic steering response">
<text>Dynamic steering response (DSR) is a vehicle safety and advanced power steering system that can counteract unstable or difficult steering that may be caused by external forces such as strong crosswinds or uneven roads by giving proper steering assistance from the steering gear. DSR assists the driver by determining the correct steering ratio in a vehicle&#x27;s power steering system to provide steering corrections to stabilize vehicles and increase safety. The system determines the steering ratio (the amount of turning of the steering wheel to the amount of turning of the vehicle’s wheels) based on factors such as current road conditions and vehicle speed. This system works by having an electric motor attached to the steering gear of a vehicle reducing or increasing the torque needed to steer based on the situation. Thus, less physical input from the driver is required creating a more comfortable driving experience overall.

DSR was first implemented in SEAT’s 2002 León Cupra R. But according to Acumen Research and Consulting, as of February 04, 2020, among the companies that have manufactured DSR systems, “the leading competitors are BMW, Ford Motor, Volvo, ZF-TRW, AUDI, Bosch, Denso Corporation, Danfoss, and Knorr-Bremse”. But DSR’s implementation is not limited to commercial cars as buses and industrial vehicles have taken advantage of the technology as well.

== Components ==

The main components of Dynamic Steering Response systems in automobiles are the control unit, sensors, and the electric motor. The control unit acts as the computer of the DSR unit and gives instructions to the electric motor. Instructions are determined by evaluating data from sensors to compute appropriate steering corrections. Sensors collect data such as current vehicle speed, turning angle, terrain conditions, crosswind acceleration, and torque applied to the steering wheel. The electric motor is a device powered by electricity that adds torque in the form of mechanical energy to a steering gear(the gear responsible for translating the rotation of the steering wheel to the actual turning of a vehicle). After calculating necessary steering corrections, the control unit instructs the electric motor to apply the torque needed to the vehicle&#x27;s hydraulic steering gear. For the motor&#x27;s control, it picks up the data at 2000 times a second (as in Volvo truck FM Series) based on the input from the driver, and from the on-board sensors. Its purpose is to provide precise steering control in every situation.

== Steering Correction in Certain Situations ==
The Dynamic Steering Response system can adapt to varying environments that would require steering assistance. Sensors constantly monitor road conditions and vehicle speed then relay this information to the control unit. The control unit’s instruction to the electric motor will differ based on the current environmental situations the vehicle faces.

=== Crosswind Stabilization ===
When a crosswind is detected, the DSR system’s sensors take in data such as crosswind acceleration(the force of a crosswind perpendicular to the vehicle), tire friction(the force between the tires and the surface preventing the tires from sliding), the inertia of the vehicle(the vehicle’s tendency to drive in a stable direction), and the current steering angle. Observed data such as driving behavior and offset steering bias is also taken into account. Driving behavior is determined through the accumulation of data over a longer period rather than the data that’s collected by sensors in real-time such as the data mentioned above. Offset steering bias is also determined over a longer period where the driver’s tendency to rotate the steering wheel off-center when driving straight is recorded. The control unit will utilize the data above to calculate the force of the crosswind acting on the vehicle&#x27;s center of mass and determine the torque the electric motor should exert on the steering hydraulics to stiffen the steering wheel the proper amount.

=== Uneven Roads ===
The DSR system&#x27;s sensors constantly monitor the conditions of the road to detect obstructions such as uneven pavement or potholes. If road conditions cause a vehicle to deviate from its path, DSR will correct its path by applying necessary torque to its steering column autonomously. Drivers do not have to stabilize the steering wheel by hand as DSR will counteract the vibrations of the steering wheel caused by uneven roads.

=== Fast/Slow Speeds ===
In situations where the vehicle is traveling at high speeds, the DSR system will tighten the steering wheel and lower the steering ratio to allow the vehicle to travel in a stable direction. The steering wheel will be set in place rather than having the driver hold the wheel tightly to prevent it from shaking. At lower speeds, the DSR system will increase the steering ratio by having the electric motor provide more assistance to the hydraulic steering system. Thus, less torque is needed to be applied to the steering wheel when making sharp turns. This makes the action of steering feel lighter and more controlled.

== Benefits ==
It increases the vehicle&#x27;s maneuverability, making it more comfortable to drive.
This takes away the physical effort of steering even at low speeds, regardless of how heavy the load is, by continuous feedback and sensing by the system. It improves the directional stability at high speeds, so that no small steering adjustments are needed.
It diminishes the effect of road disturbances such as bumps and potholes, on the steering wheel at the cockpit. It detects the unwanted deviations in the wheels, with the electric servo motor balances it out.

Dynamic Steering Response systems reduce the torque required by drivers to make turns and stabilize their vehicles. In 2018, a study done by the International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics determined that dynamic steering reduced overall muscle activity on average by 15-25% when turning. They also reported a 68% reduction of muscle activity on steering maneuvers that required full ranges of motion from the drivers. Dynamic steering makes driving a more comfortable experience as pain and risk of injury from muscle activity is greatly reduced.

DSR systems also make driving more safer as vehicle stability and steering control is greatly improved. Obstacles on the road such as uneven grounds or potholes can cause unstable driving. But with DSR, vehicles now have greater directional stability counteracting the forces of uneven surfaces and potholes, reducing accidents. In addition to the reduction of driving fatigue, precise control of turns and stability at higher speeds ultimately increases safety with the implementation of DSR. The issue of possible electrical or sensor failure in DSR is also accounted for. In the case of this event, DSR is programmed to shut itself and the electric motor off to revert the vehicle back to hydraulic steering(steering without the assistance of DSR).

<doc id="1194862" wikidata="Q3416359" url="?curid=1194862" title="Radar Records">
<text>Radar Records was a UK-based record label formed in late 1977 by Martin Davis (managing director) who had previously worked at United Artists Records, and Andrew Lauder, who had previously been head of A&amp;R at the UK divisions of Liberty Records and United Artists. The label&#x27;s first records were released in early 1978.

==Overview==
Radar was distributed in most of the world by WEA Records (now known as Warner Music Group). In the United States, three Radar artists (the Inmates, Bram Tchaikovsky and Yachts) were signed to Polydor Records through a licensing deal.

Nick Lowe released both the first Radar single (&quot;I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass&quot;/&quot;They Called It Rock&quot;, ADA 1) and its first album (&quot;Jesus of Cool&quot;, RAD 1). Lowe had previously been signed to Stiff Records, as had several other Radar acts, including Yachts, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Radar&#x27;s major act, Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Costello and Lowe were brought to Radar by their manager Jake Riviera when Riviera left Stiff, which he had co-founded.

Other prominent Radar acts included La Düsseldorf, the Pop Group, Loudon Wainwright III, Pere Ubu, Clive Langer and the Boxes, 999, Wayne Kramer, the Soft Boys, Bette Bright and the Illuminations, Tanz Der Youth, Visage and Métal Urbain. Several of Radar&#x27;s early releases (including Iggy Pop and James Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Kill City&quot;, National Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Not Funny, That&#x27;s Sick!&quot;, the Good Rats&#x27; &quot;From Rats to Riches&quot; and Pezband&#x27;s &quot;Laughing in the Dark&quot;) were licensed from independent American labels. Radar also released new albums by original 1950s rockabilly singers Ray Campi and Mac Curtis through an arrangement with Rollin&#x27; Rock Records.

Some Radar releases were reissues of garage rock and psychedelic rock bands from the 1960s. Through its WEA connections, Radar was able to rerelease recordings by the Shadows of Knight (originally on the Atlantic-distributed Dunwich Records) and the Electric Prunes (originally on the Warner Bros.-distributed Reprise Records). In addition, Radar licensed the International Artists catalog, allowing them to reissue albums by the 13th Floor Elevators and the Red Krayola. Radar also released new recordings by the Red Krayola&#x27;s late 1970s lineup.

The original Radar label put out its last release in 1981, but it was revived with a new roster between 1995 and 1998. Notable bands signed to the second version of Radar included Midget, Prolapse, Acacia, Morning Glories, Heave, Unsophisticates and Pure Morning, a precursor of Clinic.

<doc id="1194872" wikidata="Q2019823" url="?curid=1194872" title="Potter sequence">
<text>Potter sequence is the atypical physical appearance of a baby due to oligohydramnios experienced when in the uterus. It includes clubbed feet, pulmonary hypoplasia and cranial anomalies related to the oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios is the decrease in amniotic fluid volume sufficient to cause deformations in morphogenesis of the baby.

Oligohydramnios is the cause of Potter sequence, but there are many things that can lead to oligohydramnios. It can be caused by renal diseases such as bilateral renal agenesis (BRA), atresia of the ureter or urethra causing obstruction of the urinary tract, polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases, renal hypoplasia, amniotic rupture, toxemia, or uteroplacental insufficiency from maternal hypertension.

The term &quot;Potter sequence&quot; was initially intended to only refer to cases caused by BRA; however, it is now commonly used by many clinicians and researchers to refer to any case that presents with oligohydramnios or anhydramnios regardless of the source of the loss of amniotic fluid.

==Types==
Since its initial characterization, Potter sequence has been defined into five distinct subclassifications. There are those in the medical and research fields that use the term Potter sequence to specifically refer to only cases of BRA, while other groups use the term to loosely refer to all instances of oligohydramnios and anhydramnios regardless of the specific cause. The assignment of nomenclature to the various causes (types) was employed in order to help clarify these discrepancies, but these subclassifications and nomenclature system have not caught on in the medical and research communities.

==Signs and symptoms==
The failure of the metanephros to develop in cases of BRA and some cases involving unilateral renal agenesis (URA) is due primarily to the failure of the mesonephric duct to produce a ureteric bud capable of inducing the metanephric mesenchyme. The failed induction will thereby cause the subsequent degeneration of the metanephros by apoptosis and other mechanisms. The mesonephric duct(s) of the agenic kidney(s) will also degenerate and fail to connect with the bladder. Therefore, the means by which the fetus produces urine and transports it to the bladder for excretion into the amniotic sac has been severely compromised (in the cases of URA), or completely eliminated (in the cases of BRA). The decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mother&#x27;s uterus. This compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus, most common of which is Potter facies. Lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases, which often present with clubbed feet and/or bowing of the legs. Sirenomelia, or &quot;Mermaid syndrome&quot; (which occurs approximately in 1:45,000 births) can also present. In fact, nearly all reported cases of sirenomelia also present with BRA.It is associated with childhood polycystic kidney disease which is autosomal recessive in origin 

Other anomalies of the classic Potter sequence infant include a parrot beak nose, redundant skin, and the most common characteristic of infants with BRA which is a skin fold of tissue extending from the medial canthus across the cheek. The ears are slightly low and pressed against the head making them appear large. The adrenal glands often appear as small oval discs pressed against the posterior abdomen due to the absence of upward renal pressure. The bladder is often small, nondistensible and may be filled with a minute amount of fluid. In males the vas deferens and seminal vesicles may be absent, while in females the uterus and upper vagina may be absent. Other abnormalities include anal atresia, absence of the rectum and sigmoid colon, esophageal and duodenal atresia, and a single umbilical artery. Presence of a diaphragmatic hernia is also common in these fetuses/infants. Additionally, the alveolar sacs of the lungs fail to properly develop as a result of the reduced volume of amniotic fluid. Labor is often induced between 22 and 36 weeks of gestation (however, some of these pregnancies may go to term) and unaborted infants typically survive for only a few minutes to a few hours. These infants will eventually die as either a result of pulmonary hypoplasia or renal failure.

==Causes==

The Potter sequence is due to restricted ability for certain organs to grow due to severe oligohydramnios.

In one study, the causes leading to Potter sequence were bilateral renal agenesis in 21.25% of cases; cystic dysplasia in 47.5%; obstructive uropathy in 25%; and others in 5.25%.

===Bilateral renal agenesis===

Bilateral renal agenesis has been estimated to occur at a frequency of approximately 1:4000 to 1:8000 fetuses and neonates. However, recent analysis has estimated that the condition may occur at a much greater frequency. The condition has been reported to occur twice as commonly in males as in females, suggesting that certain genes of the Y chromosome may act as modifiers. However, no candidate genes on the Y chromosome have yet been identified.

BRA appears to have a predominantly genetic etiology and many cases represent the most severe manifestation of an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. There are several genetic pathways that could result in this condition. In 2017 researchers identified heritable autosomal dominant mutations in the gene GREB1L in two unrelated families as being the cause of both BRA and URA utilizing exome sequencing and direct sequence analysis. This is the first reported genetic lesion implicated in the activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) targets that has been associated with renal agenesis in humans. The majority of other possible candidate genetic pathways are autosomal recessive in nature and do not coincide with the frequency or penetrance at which BRA typically occurs in the human population. Additionally, candidate genetic pathways would be expected to involve genes expressed in the developing urogenital system (UGS). Often, these same genes and/or pathways of interacting genes are also expressed in the developing UGS as well as the central nervous system (CNS), gut, lung, limbs, and eyes.

==Pathogenesis==
Development of the mature kidney begins between weeks 5 and 7 of gestation. Fetal urine production begins in early gestation and comprises the majority of the amniotic fluid in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The fetus continuously swallows amniotic fluid, which is reabsorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and then reintroduced into the amniotic cavity by the kidneys via urination. Oligohydramnios occurs if the volume of amniotic fluid is less than normal for the corresponding period of gestation. The fetal urine is critical to the proper development of the lungs by aiding in the expansion of the airways (alveoli) by means of hydrodynamic pressure and by also supplying proline which is a critical amino acid for lung development. Alveoli are the small sacs in the lungs that exchange oxygen with the blood. If the alveoli, and thereby the lungs, are underdeveloped at the time of birth the infant will not be able to breathe air properly and will go into respiratory distress shortly after birth due to pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs). This is the primary cause of death to Potter sequence infants secondary to renal failure. The fetal urine also serves to cushion the fetus from being compressed by the mother&#x27;s uterus as it grows.
==Diagnosis==
==Prognosis==
The outcome of Potter&#x27;s Sequence is poor. A series of 23 patients in 2007 recorded 7 deaths, 4 in the neonatal period. All 16 survivors have chronic kidney disease, with half developing end stage renal failure (median age 0.3 years, range 2 days to 8.3 years). Survivors had growth impairment (44%) and cognitive and motor development delay (25%)

The first child to survive bilateral renal agenesis (BRA), Abigail Rose Herrera Beutler, was born in July 2013 to US Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler.
A few weeks before she was born, Dr. Jessica Bienstock, a professor of maternal–fetal medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, administered a series of saline solution injections into the mother&#x27;s womb to help the baby&#x27;s lungs to develop. After Abigail was born, the procedure was considered a success. The infant did not need artificial respiration and could breathe on her own. Her parents kept her on at-home kidney dialysis until she was old enough for a kidney transplant. On February 8, 2016, at the age of two, Abigail received a kidney from her father at the Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital Stanford in California.

==History==
Bilateral renal agenesis (BRA) was first recognized as a defect of human fetal development in 1671 by Wolfstrigel.

In 1946, Edith Potter (1901–1993) described a series of 20 cases with absent kidneys, noting the characteristic appearance of the head and lungs. Up until this time, the condition itself was considered to be extremely rare. However, due in part to Potter&#x27;s work, it has come to light that the condition presents far more frequently than previously reported. Potter analyzed approximately 5000 autopsy cases performed on fetuses and newborn infants over a period of ten years and found that 20 of these infants presented with BRA, all of which had distinctive facial characteristics which did not appear to have any specific embryologic correlation with the renal anomaly. It was only much later that she and others were to attribute the multiple congenital deformities, including the features of Potter&#x27;s facies and also pulmonary hypoplasia, to the prolonged lack of amniotic fluid. These facial characteristics have subsequently been referred to as Potter facies. From her analysis, she was able to deduce the sequence of events that leads to what is now known as Potter sequence.

Potter went on to become a pioneer in the field of human renal development; her contributions are still employed and appreciated by clinicians and researchers to the present time.

==Terminology==
Potter syndrome is not technically a syndrome as it does not collectively present with the same telltale characteristics and symptoms in each and every case. It is more accurately described as a &quot;sequence&quot; or chain of events that may have different beginnings (absent kidneys, cystic kidneys, obstructed ureters or other causes), but which all end with the same conclusion (absent or reduced volume of amniotic fluid). This is why Potter syndrome is often called &quot;Potter sequence&quot; or &quot;oligohydramnios sequence&quot; by some clinicians and researchers. The term &quot;Potter syndrome&quot; is most frequently associated with the condition of oligohydramnios sequence regardless of the root cause of the absence or reduced volume of amniotic fluid. However, as noted in this article, the term &quot;Potter syndrome&quot; was initially coined in order to refer to fetuses and infants with BRA. It was not until later that the term became more encompassing as it was noted that other causes of failed fetal urine production also resulted in similar physical characteristics and prognoses of the fetuses and infants with BRA (that which Potter originally described in 1946). Since then, the term &quot;Potter syndrome&quot; has become a misnomer and experts have attempted not to eliminate the terminology, but to modify it in a way so as to be able to determine the different root causes by creating a nomenclature system. However, this classification system has not caught on in the clinical and research fields.

<text>Peter Norton Computing, Inc., was a software company founded by Peter Norton. The first and best known software package it produced was Norton Utilities. Another successful software package was Norton Commander, especially the DOS version. The company in this form lasted from its founding in 1982 until 1990, when it was acquired by Symantec (now Gen Digital).

The Symantec merger helped Norton Computing regain the market share it was losing to competitors, especially Central Point Software. Norton Computing&#x27;s revenues tripled between June 1990 and September 1991, and by November it appeared to have regained the market lead over Central Point.

==History==
Peter Norton founded the company in 1982 with $30,000 and an IBM computer. The company was a pioneer in DOS-based utilities software. Its 1982 introduction of the Norton Utilities included Norton&#x27;s UNERASE tool to retrieve erased data from DOS disks.

In 1984, Norton Computing reached $1 million in revenue, and version 3.0 of the Norton Utilities was released. Norton had three clerical people working for him. He was doing all of the software development, all of the book writing, all of the manual writing and running the business. The only thing he wasn&#x27;t doing was stuffing the packages. He hired his fourth employee and first programmer, Brad Kingsbury, in July 1985. John Socha, the author of Norton Commander until 1989, was hired shortly after. From November 1985 until April 1986 Warren Woodford worked at Norton Computing and created Norton Guides. In late 1985, Norton hired a business manager to take care of the day-to-day operations.

In 1985, Norton Computing produced the Norton Editor, a programmer&#x27;s text editor created by Stanley Reifel, and Norton Guides, a terminate-and-stay-resident program which showed reference information for assembly language and other IBM PC internals, but could also display other reference information compiled into the appropriate file format. Norton Commander, a file managing tool for DOS, was introduced in 1986. In this year PNCI reached $5 million in revenues with Norton Utilities still bringing the largest parts.

In 1990, the company was acquired by Symantec. The acquired company became a division of Symantec and was renamed Peter Norton Computing Group. Most of Norton Computing&#x27;s 115 employees were retained.

<doc id="1194874" wikidata="Q1154327" url="?curid=1194874" title="XIII (2003 video game)">
<text>XIII (&quot;thirteen&quot;) is a first-person shooter video game, loosely based on the first five volumes of the 1984 Belgian graphic novel series of the same name. Developed and published by Ubisoft, it was released in November 2003 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and GameCube; an Xbox version of the game, released at the same time, was developed by Southend Interactive, while an OS X version was developed by Zonic, published by Feral Interactive, and released in June 2004.

Designed with a comic book-style, cel-shaded presentation, the game incorporates single-player and multiplayer game modes. The game&#x27;s main story focuses on a confused and amnesic man who searches for his identity after being found stranded on a beach. He slowly finds himself caught up in a conspiracy by a group who aims to overthrow the government. The protagonist assassinated the President of the United States, and is wanted by the FBI.

&quot;XIII&quot; received mixed reviews and sold poorly upon release, suspending plans for a sequel. However, the game has sinced gathered a cult following. It also received a follow-up game for mobile phones entitled &quot;XIII: Covert Identity&quot;, and a re-imagining of the game as a hidden object game entitled &quot;XIII: Lost Identity&quot; in October 2011. A remake of the original game for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows and Xbox One was released on November 10, 2020.

==Gameplay==
&quot;XIII&quot; is a first-person shooter with elements of stealth and action in certain missions. The game centers on the main character, named XIII, who has awakened with amnesia. He uses a variety of weapons and gadgets to uncover the mystery of his identity throughout the 13 chapters and 34 missions.

&quot;XIII&quot; includes 16 weapons, from a knife to a bazooka, an Uzi to an M60. Objects such as bottles, chairs, or brooms may be used as weapons. Kevlar gear, helmets and first aid boxes are scattered throughout the map. People can be taken as hostages or as human shields, preventing enemies from firing on the protagonist. Lock picks are used to unlock doors and grapnels to climb on walls. Through the &quot;sixth sense&quot;, XIII can hear enemies behind walls with the aid of &quot;tap-tap-tap&quot; signals. Stealth operations include strangling enemies or hiding dead bodies. Comic strip-style insets pop up at the top when a headshot is performed or serve as clues or tips for the player.

===Multiplayer===
The multiplayer hosts a maximum of 16 players. The game features three standard game modes along with modes exclusive to each system: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Sabotage (on Xbox and PC), The Hunt (on PC, PS2 and GameCube), and Power-Up (on PC and PS2). Depending on the platform, players in online and offline modes (against bots) range from 4 to 16. The GameCube version does not have any online modes, while the PC version excludes the multi-screen modes but includes a map editor. There are 13 maps on Deathmatch plus one additional on Team Deathmatch, while 5 on Capture the Flag and 3 on Sabotage. The player can choose from among 10 different character appearances.

In Deathmatch, all players compete against each other and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must retrieve the flag from their enemy&#x27;s base, and bring it to their own team&#x27;s base. In Sabotage, one team must place a bomb in three different locations, while the opposite team must protect these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found at the beginning of the team base, and the player who holds the bomb must wait 12 seconds until they may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. In The Hunt, players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which they can shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map.

In line with other online-enabled games on the Xbox, multiplayer on Xbox Live was available to players until 15 April 2010. &quot;XIII&quot; is now playable online again on the replacement Xbox Live servers called Insignia.

==Graphics==

The characters and weaponry in &quot;XIII&quot; are rendered with cel shading, giving a deliberately comic book style appearance, including onomatopoeic words contained in bubbles for sound effects. It uses Unreal Engine 2 because it was &quot;really strong for level design&quot; and allowed development &quot;across all platforms using one engine&quot;. The graphics were compared with &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; and &quot;Auto Modellista&quot;. The developer felt that the appearance reflected the comic book and innovated in its portrayal of violence; blood splatters are shown in a cartoon manner.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The game&#x27;s setting takes place within the same arrangement as the first five volumes of the 1984 Belgian graphic novel series &quot;XIII&quot;. While the plot itself borrows major elements from all five volumes to create singular narrative - the attempt to uncover the identities of a group of conspirators seeking to overthrow the US government, and the involvement of a man with no memory to achieve this - the adaptation of the comics features notable differences and situations in various places.

===Synopsis===
On a beach in Brooklyn, New York City, a man with a gunshot wound is found by a lifeguard. Suffering from amnesia, the man can only recall being shot at while trying to escape from a boat, and learns he possesses a bank deposit key and a tattoo of the Roman numeral XIII on his right shoulder. When men led by a hitman named the Mongoose arrive to kill him, identifying him as XIII, he finds himself forced to escape. Investigating the key leads XIII to a bank where he recalls he was investigating a conspiracy, but had set a trap for those involved that he inadvertently sets off. Forced to escape in the chaos, XIII finds himself arrested outside the bank by the FBI for the assassination of the President of the United States, William Sheridan. Interrogated by the lead investigator, Colonel Amos, the man learns that his face belongs to that of the shooter in the murder, Steve Rowland. After the Mongoose attacks the FBI headquarters, XIII finds himself aided by a female soldier named Jones, whom he remembers working with, and escapes from the city.

Jones informs XIII that the pair were working with war veteran General Ben Carrington, who was conducting a parallel investigation into the president&#x27;s death and had unearthed a conspiracy against the US government. Learning that Carrington was arrested and taken to a base station in the Appalachian Mountains, XIII proceeds to rescue him in order to uncover his past. Carrington agrees to help him, but instructs XIII to assist a contact in the Rocky Mountains. XIII meets with the contact who identifies herself as Kim Rowland, and that he is not Rowland; the real Rowland, her husband, died after committing the assassination. Protecting her from the men sent by the Mongoose, XIII is captured following an avalanche and promptly taken away to a mental asylum for examination after the hitman suspects him to be an impostor. XIII manages to escape, killing the asylum&#x27;s director, Edward Johannsen (identified as Number XX), before reuniting with Jones.

Informed of a meeting taking place in Mexico, XIII is sent to eavesdrop on it within the base of a special forces group called SPADS. During his infiltration, XIII finds out, while listening to a pair of SPADS soldiers&#x27; conversation, that he is actually Jason Fly, a squadmate of Rowland. Gathering evidence that the conspiracy involves a coup using SPADS soldiers led by a powerful group, XIII deals with two conspirators Seymour McCall (colonel of the SPADS identified as Number XI) and Franklin Edelbright (captain of the submarine USS Patriot and Number VII), while eliminating a stockpile of weapons meant for the coup. Upon returning to the United States, Carrington rendezvous with XIII alongside Amos, and reveals to both that Sheridan&#x27;s murder was conceived by Rowland, only to be betrayed and murdered by the conspirators after the assassination, but survived long enough to contact his wife. Angered by his death, Kim decided to get revenge, and decided to expose the identity of the group and their scheme to the authorities through faking Rowland&#x27;s survival. Carrington reveals that Fly agreed to assist by undergoing plastic surgery to replicate Rowland&#x27;s appearance; XIII recalls he had been close to identifying the leader, before something went wrong.

With the aid of the FBI, XIII proceeds to uncover the identity of the conspirators, and infiltrates a nearby hotel where two more of the conspirators, Jasper Winslow (head of the bank named after him identified as Number IX) and Clayton Willard (a US senator identified as Number V), meet to discuss their progress, but are killed on the spot. XIII&#x27;s next target is the meeting site of the group to find out how the coup will occur. With sufficient evidence, XIII, Amos, and Carrington meet with William&#x27;s brother Walter, and explain to him the conspiracy - a group of powerful people in the United States, calling themselves &quot;The XX&quot; (&quot;The Twenty&quot;) - due to the Roman numerals tattooed onto each member - planned a coup during a war simulation exercise using loyal SPADS soldiers, who would replace US democracy with a totalitarian government. As the coup involves a key military facility, Walter offers assistance to gain entry to the site. Shortly after arriving, XIII finds himself having to protect William&#x27;s successor when SPADS begin attacking the site, eliminating the remaining members that had not been killed or arrested, including William Standwell (former Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force identified as Number III) and Calvin Wax, former US Secretary of Defense and the sole possessor of Number I&#x27;s identity who shoots himself (he is thought to be Number I, but is identified as Number II instead), before defeating the Mongoose in one final battle.

With the coup thwarted, Walter holds a party on his private yacht. While seeking him out, XIII overhears Kim arguing with Walter and enters the latter&#x27;s private office to hear a weakened Mongoose on the speakerphone trying to contact Number I. XIII then has one final flashback in which he recalls that he was on that yacht previously when he came close to identifying Number I; realising the person he saw in the office he is currently standing in was Walter. The game ends on a cliffhanger when Walter, accompanied by armed bodyguards, finds XIII in the office, leaving whether or not Walter is, in fact, Number I ambiguous.

==Development==

Ubisoft announced on March 13, 2002, that it would be working on a game called &quot;XIII&quot;. Based on the comic book of the same name by Belgian Jean Van Hamme. The game debuted at an event in Montreal, and was submitted at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2002, with such games as &quot;Doom III&quot;, &quot;Max Payne 2&quot; and &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot;. On November 22, 2002, Ubi Soft announced a delay of the game. Justin Calvert of GameSpot guessed that the time would be used to thoroughly check the game and implement additional features on other platforms.

On May 7, 2003, Ubisoft announced that singer, actress and model Eve would be the voice for major character Jones. Ubisoft&#x27;s vice president of marketing, Tony Kee, stated that she was the perfect choice for the role, admitting that she has &quot;a combination of style, sexiness, and attitude—perfect attributes that describe the Jones character.&quot; Two months later, two other major voice acts were revealed: David Duchovny would play Jason Fly (XIII), while Adam West, General Carrington. The official site was launched on August 19, featuring videos and information about the gameplay. Ubisoft implemented a pre-order on September 4, promising a free demonstration version with multiplayer and soundtrack.

The game was promoted at the Fall College Tour from September to October. Beginning at Cornell University and finishing at the University of Southern California, the tour featured demonstrations of games, playable via the 50-screen GamePort system. Another demo, multiplayer-only, was issued on October 2, but the discovery of a bug led to its removal. A different fixed demo was released a day later. Xbox players had the opportunity from December 15 on to win one of 50 copies of the game. The campaign was dubbed &quot;13 Days to Xmas&quot;: those who spent not less than 13 hours playing until Christmas were qualified for the contest. The winner was randomly selected on January 9.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;The Thirteen Soundtrack&quot; was composed by several artists from the San Francisco-based music label Future Primitive Sound. 13 tracks were produced, all of which were initially unnamed. According to the booklet, the DJs are connected with the characters, such as DJ Faust and Shortee with XIII, DJ Zeph with Carrington, or J-Boogie&#x27;s Dubtronic Science with Mongoose. The album opens with an introduction and then includes songs in the likes of typical 1970s-era music such as soul, funk, jazz, while also incorporating hip hop. According to founder and creative director of the collective, Mark Herlihy, the soundtrack project began with Herlihy&#x27;s friend, Pete Jacobs, whom he met at a gig, five or six years previously. After studying the characters and the story, the group decided on a noir and futuristic style that would reflect the espionage theme. Its rhythm ranges from 105 to 120 bpm.

Herlihy later stated that they &quot;wanted to capture the essence of &quot;XIII&quot; in this soundtrack by showcasing its nostalgic style while giving the beats a modern twist&quot; and their intention was &quot;to tell its story through the music and create a seamless head-nodding mix that would complement the energy of &quot;XIII&quot; and get gamers hyped.&quot; One reviewer of IGN gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s an album that works expertly as a chill-out slice of background groove, yet it also doubles as a dance floor jolt of exuberance perfect for spinning at a small party&quot;, but also stated that the player, understandably, quickly forgets the music while playing. He concluded that the album is &quot;jazzaphonic electronic tripped out funkuphoria&quot;.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
&quot;XIII&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.

Reviewers often praised the game&#x27;s graphical style and presentation, while criticising the gameplay. GamePro called it a &quot;rejuvenating, jaw-dropping experience&quot;. IGN said &quot;&quot;XIII&quot; has a great story-driven sheen, but at its core, it&#x27;s weighed down by some occasional bewildering flaws, in addition to the lackluster weapons and simple combat&quot;. GameZone also criticised the combat, stating &quot;If not for the graphics to carry the game through, &quot;XIII&quot; would have been a boring game. Gunfights are the best part of the gameplay. It also happens to be the most unbalanced part&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; said &quot;XIII&quot; had &quot;true artistic merit: it never gets stale; every episode has been drawn with minute care and attention. It would have been an incredible achievement if the gameplay had matched the outstanding art direction&quot;. GameSpy criticised the graphics and the multiplayer mode, and concluded &quot;When it comes right down to it, &quot;XIII&quot; is a fine game...Just don&#x27;t expect the FPS of the year because, sadly, this isn&#x27;t it&quot;.

&quot;GamesTM&quot; said &quot;It&#x27;s one of those mixed-bag situations – flashes of genius and genuinely enjoyable moments of success, occasionally mired by unbalanced weapon damage, clumsy AI and the odd bit of unfair level design that requires astounding feats of memory&quot;. Eurogamer called &quot;XIII&quot; &quot;a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking from most of the factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity&quot;. Game Revolution complimented the game&#x27;s story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as &quot;about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS&quot;.

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, &quot;You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than &quot;XIII&quot;&quot;, but complained that &quot;numerous frustrations pile up to make &quot;XIII&quot; more chore than thrill&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its &quot;style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [but] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane&quot;; he concluded, &quot;But if all you need is a solid shooter fix, &quot;XIII&quot; will do just fine. It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going&quot;.

==== Sales ====
Sales performance for &quot;XIII&quot; was lower than expected. In 2010, UGO ranked it #7 on the list of the games that need sequels.

=== Awards ===
At the first Spike Video Game Awards in 2003, &quot;XIII&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Best Animation&quot; category and &quot;Best First Person Action&quot; category, but lost to &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty&quot; respectively. &quot;XIII&quot; also received a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition&quot; during the AIAS&#x27; 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

==Sequel and remakes==
While the anticipated sequel on major gaming platforms remained unrealized due to poor sales of the original title, Gameloft released a follow-up on mobile phones titled &quot;XIII²: Covert Identity&quot; in October 2007, which was a side-scrolling game rather than a first-person shooter.

A re-imagining of &quot;XIII&quot;, called &quot;XIII: Lost Identity&quot;, was released by Anuman Interactive for Microsoft Windows, iPhone and iPad on November 15, 2011. The game is not a shooter, but a hidden object game.

On April 18, 2019, a remake of the original game was announced for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, which was developed by PlayMagic Ltd and published by Microids. It was originally scheduled for release on November 13, 2019, until it was delayed to 2020 for further development. It released on November 10, 2020 and was received extremely poorly by both consumers and critics, with Metacritic naming it the second worst game of the year, behind Tiny Racer for Nintendo Switch. Nearly two years after its release, Microids released an overhaul update of the remake by an entirely different studio, the France-based Tower Five, replacing PlayMagic.

<doc id="1194878" wikidata="Q1545284" url="?curid=1194878" title="Terry Melcher">
<text>Terrence Paul Melcher (; February 8, 1942 – November 19, 2004) was an American record producer, singer and songwriter who was instrumental in shaping the mid-to-late 1960s California Sound and folk rock movements. His best-known contributions were producing the Byrds&#x27; first two albums &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; (1965) and &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; (1965) as well as most of the hit recordings of Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and Gentle Soul. He is also known for his collaboration with Bruce Johnston and for his association with the Manson Family.

Melcher was the only child of actress/singer Doris Day, his father was Day&#x27;s first husband Al Jorden and he was adopted by her third husband Martin Melcher. Most of his early recordings were with the vocal surf acts the Rip Chords and Bruce &amp; Terry. In the 1960s, Melcher was acquainted with the Beach Boys and later produced several singles for the group in the 1980s and the 1990s, including &quot;Kokomo&quot; (1988), which topped U.S. record charts.

==Background==
Terrence Paul Jorden was born in New York City to singer-actress Doris Day and her first husband, trombonist Al Jorden. Known as &quot;Terry&quot;, the boy was named by his mother after the hero of her favorite childhood comic strip, &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;.

Before his birth, Day was planning to divorce Al Jorden because of his violent temper and alleged physical abuse. Jorden responded to his wife&#x27;s pregnancy by demanding that she get an abortion. Shortly after giving birth, Day filed for divorce and left the infant with her mother in Ohio while she went back to touring with big band leader Les Brown. After the divorce, Jorden visited his son infrequently and had little presence in his life.

After divorcing her second husband, saxophonist George Weidler, Day married Martin Melcher, who would become her manager and produce many of her films. Melcher adopted Terry and gave him his surname. In his freshman and sophomore high-school years, Terry attended the Loomis Chaffee School in Connecticut, then returned to California for his junior and senior years at Beverly Hills High School. He subsequently attended Principia College in Illinois for a short time. After Martin Melcher&#x27;s death in 1968, Day discovered that he had mismanaged or embezzled $20 million from her, while Terry claimed that his stepfather had mistreated him as a child.

==Early career==
Melcher has been credited with helping to shape the sound of 1960s surf music in California. In the early 1960s, Melcher and Bruce Johnston formed the vocal duet Bruce &amp; Terry. The duo had hits like &quot;Custom Machine&quot; and &quot;Summer Means Fun&quot;. Melcher and Johnston also created another group, The Rip Chords, which had a top 10 hit with &quot;Hey Little Cobra&quot;. Later, Johnston would join the Beach Boys.

By the mid-1960s, Melcher had joined the staff of Columbia Records and went on to work with the Byrds. He produced their hit cover versions of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;, as well as the corresponding albums &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;

Following conflicts with the band and their manager, Melcher was replaced as producer by Allen Stanton and then Gary Usher, although he would work with the Byrds again on their &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;(Untitled)&quot; and &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; albums. Melcher also worked with Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, Wayne Newton, Frankie Laine, Jimmy Boyd, Pat Boone, Glen Campbell, Mark Lindsay and the Mamas &amp; the Papas. He was instrumental in signing Los Angeles band the Rising Sons, led by Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder.

Melcher performed on the Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, playing tambourine on &quot;That&#x27;s Not Me&quot;, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, and was a board member of the Monterey Pop Foundation and a producer of the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.

==Manson Family==

In 1968, Beach Boy Dennis Wilson introduced Melcher to ex-con and aspiring musician Charles Manson. Manson and his &quot;family&quot; had been living in Wilson&#x27;s house at 14400 Sunset Boulevard after Wilson had picked up hitchhiking Manson family members Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey. Wilson expressed interest in Manson&#x27;s music and also recorded two of Manson&#x27;s songs with the Beach Boys. For a time, Melcher was interested in recording Manson&#x27;s music as well as making a film about the family and their hippie commune existence. Manson met Melcher at 10050 Cielo Drive, the home that Melcher shared with his girlfriend, actress Candice Bergen and musician Mark Lindsay.

Manson eventually auditioned for Melcher but Melcher declined to sign him. There was still talk of a documentary being made about Manson&#x27;s music but Melcher abandoned the project after witnessing Manson fighting with a drunken stuntman at Spahn Ranch. Wilson and Melcher severed their ties with Manson, a move that angered Manson. Soon after, Melcher and Bergen moved out of the Cielo Drive home. The house&#x27;s owner, Rudi Altobelli, then leased it to film director Roman Polanski and his wife, actress Sharon Tate. Manson was reported to have visited the house on more than one occasion asking for Melcher but was told that Melcher had moved.

On August 8–9, 1969, the house was the site of the murders of Tate (who was eight months pregnant at the time), coffee heiress Abigail Folger, hairdresser Jay Sebring, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent by members of Manson&#x27;s &quot;family&quot;. Some authors and law enforcement personnel have theorized that the Cielo Drive house was targeted by Manson as revenge for Melcher&#x27;s rejection and that Manson was unaware that he and Bergen had moved out. However, family member Charles &quot;Tex&quot; Watson stated that Manson and company did, in fact, know that Melcher was no longer living there, and Melcher&#x27;s former roommate Mark Lindsay stated, &quot;Terry and I talked about it later and Terry said Manson knew (Melcher had moved) because Manson or someone from his organization left a note on Terry&#x27;s porch in Malibu.&quot;

At that time, Melcher was producing singer Jimmy Boyd&#x27;s music for A&amp;M Records. After initial tracks were recorded, the Manson murders occurred, reportedly prompting Melcher to go into seclusion and the session was never completed. When Manson was arrested, it was widely reported that he had sent his followers to the house to kill Melcher and Bergen. Manson family member Susan Atkins, who admitted her part in the murders, stated to police and before a grand jury that the house was chosen as the scene for the murders &quot;to instill fear into Terry Melcher because Terry had given us his word on a few things and never came through with them&quot;. Melcher took to employing a bodyguard and told Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi that his fear was so great he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment. Melcher was described as the most frightened of the witnesses at the trial, even though Bugliosi assured him that &quot;Manson knew you were no longer living [on Cielo Drive]&quot;.

In his 2019 book &quot;&quot;, Tom O&#x27;Neill reexamined the Manson case and found evidence Melcher may have been more closely involved with the Manson family than he admitted at trial. In reviewing police files and other data, O&#x27;Neill found evidence Melcher was associating with Manson in the four month period after the Tate-Labianca murders but before Manson&#x27;s arrest. These documents, seemingly hidden by Bugliosi, undermined claims the Tate murders were intended to frighten Melcher in revenge for his refusal to record Manson&#x27;s music. O&#x27;Neill also found documents indicating Melcher was having sex with 15-year-old Manson family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse. Dean Moorehouse, Ruth Ann&#x27;s father and a Manson Family member, also had resided at 10050 Cielo Drive with Melcher. Tex Watson would frequently visit the residence.

==Later years==
Melcher again acted as producer for the Byrds on &quot;Ballad of Easy Rider&quot;, their eighth album, released in November 1969. The record peaked at No. 36 on the Billboard charts. At the time it was met with mixed reviews but is today regarded as one of the band&#x27;s stronger efforts from the latter half of their career.

In the early 1970s, Melcher produced the Byrds&#x27; 9th and 10th albums &quot;(Untitled)&quot; and &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot;. However, &quot;Byrdmaniax&quot; was not well-received as band member Gene Parsons referred to the album as &quot;Melcher&#x27;s Folly&quot; because of its prominent overdubs of horns and strings, which were done without the band&#x27;s knowledge. During this time, Melcher dabbled in real estate and served as the executive producer of his mother&#x27;s CBS series, &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;. He later recorded two solo albums, &quot;Terry Melcher&quot; and &quot;Royal Flush&quot;. Writing of the former in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said:

Most will find this producer&#x27;s daydream sterile at best and noxious at worst but I like the song about his shrink and am fascinated by his compulsion to defend his Manson connections. With the requisite show of wealth and taste, he insists that he&#x27;s only a spectator — why, he wouldn&#x27;t even know about the hand jive if it weren&#x27;t for &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Alternate title: &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Ma, I&#x27;m Only Watching&quot;.

In 1985, Melcher co-produced the cable show &quot;Doris Day&#x27;s Best Friends&quot; and worked as the director and vice president of the Doris Day Animal Foundation. He and his mother, to whom he remained close throughout his life, also co-owned the Cypress Inn, a small hotel in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.

In 1988, Melcher earned a Golden Globe nomination for co-writing the song &quot;Kokomo&quot; with John Phillips, Scott McKenzie and Mike Love. Recorded by the Beach Boys, the song was featured in the 1988 Tom Cruise film &quot;&quot;Cocktail&quot;&quot; and hit No. 1 (the band&#x27;s career fourth overall) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was certified gold with U.S. sales of more than one million copies. Melcher later co-wrote and produced the band&#x27;s 1992 studio album &quot;Summer in Paradise&quot;, which was the first record produced digitally on Pro Tools.

==Death==
On November 19, 2004, Melcher died at his home in Beverly Hills, California after a long battle with melanoma.

<doc id="1194882" wikidata="Q1411896" url="?curid=1194882" title="Albion (video game)">
<text>Albion is a role-playing video game, developed and published by Blue Byte for MS-DOS. Originally released in German in 1995, the game was later translated to English for international release the following year. The game, which mostly involves traditional fantasy elements, such as magic, combined with a science fiction setting, sees players assume the role of a space pilot aboard a mining colony ship, who becomes stranded on a world set to be mined for its resources, despite it teeming with life and sentient races.

The game is considered a spiritual successor to the Amiga role-playing video games &quot;Amberstar&quot; and &quot;Ambermoon&quot;, bearing very similar gameplay and being developed by the same core team under the Thalion Software name. Although intended for launch on the Amiga computer, the bankruptcy of Commodore shifted the developers to focusing on it being launched for PC.

&quot;Albion&quot; received positive reviews following its launch, earning praise for its originality in combat, story and puzzles. The game was re-released in 2015 on Gog.com with support for Microsoft Windows.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Albion&quot; is a role-playing video game and features a number of gameplay elements typical of that genre. The player controls a party of up to six characters, each with their own skills and abilities. With these characters they may explore the game world, fight enemies, and engage in conversation or trade. Characters earn experience points by defeating enemies or by solving certain puzzles. When a character has sufficient experience points, they will advance in level, increasing their maximum life and spell points. They will also receive training points which can be expended at a trainer to permanently increase one or more of their skills.

&quot;Albion&quot; uses a hybrid 2D/3D graphical system to depict its environments. Most interior locations are shown using a 2D overhead view, centered on the player&#x27;s party. Movement is possible using either the keyboard or the mouse and the mouse is used to examine or manipulate objects within the reach of the party leader. A similar view is used when exploring the larger world outside the cities, but with objects and characters shown on a much smaller scale. Upon entering most dungeons, caves, and the exteriors of larger cities, the game switches to a real-time first-person 3D view. As in the 2D view, players may use the mouse or keyboard to move around and the mouse is used to select objects to interact with. A 2D automap is available to assist navigation in these areas.

Combat occurs when the party runs into one or more enemies. The combat system is turn-based and takes place on a five-by-six grid similar to a chess board, with the player&#x27;s characters arranged at the bottom and their enemies at the top. At the start of each turn, the player selects an action for each character to perform: Attack, Move, Use Magic, Use Item, or Flee. The order in which party members and enemies execute their actions depends on their relative speeds and is an important tactical consideration. Since attacks are targeted at a grid square rather than the character or enemy in it, attacks will miss if their intended target moves before they are made, even if that target is still within reach. The movement of the player&#x27;s characters is limited to the bottom two rows, but there is also an &quot;Advance Party&quot; option which moves all enemies one row towards the party.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Albion&quot; takes place in the distant future during the 23rd century, where human technology on Earth has developed to the point that spaceships can venture out to distant star system with hyperspace drives, funded by corporations rather than local governments. As a result, the corporations focus highly on exploring space to find resources to support the money spent building the ships for such purposes, manning then with specialised AI systems that can utilize artificial bodies to interact with crew members. The game&#x27;s main story focuses on the titular planet of Albion, which happens to be inhabited by two distinctive races: the Iskai, a feline-like humanoid race which use plants for furniture, sewerage systems and even homes, and have developed the means of prolonged lives through magical rituals to transfer a spirit from one body to another; and the Celts, descendants of those from Earth who transported to Albion over two thousand years ago, arriving on the planet and forming their own kingdoms and societies.

===Story===
In the year 2227, the multinational DDT corporation sends the gigantic colony ship, the &quot;Toronto&quot;, to a distant planetary system to search for raw materials. After the ship exits hyperspace, pilot Tom Driscoll wakes up from a vivid dream - one of many he has experienced since the trip began - to learn that the &quot;Toronto&quot;″s communication system overloaded and blew up, killing a government inspector assigned to the ship. As a result, he is assigned Rainer Hofstedt, a junior government agent, to investigate a desert planet that the ship&#x27;s AI, Ned, has found to contain vast ore deposits. When the pair leave to conduct a planetary survey, they discover the data readings do not match those of Ned&#x27;s, moments before the shuttle malfunctions and crashlands on the surface.

Two months after the crash, the pair, learning that the planet holds life, find themselves amongst the iskai, a sentient species living on the planet, which they call Albion. Receiving their help, the pair are joined by the warrior Drirr and the mage Sira, as they proceed to find someone who could have seen the &quot;Toronto&quot; arrive on the planet. Their search leads them to encountering humans, descendants of the Celts, acquiring the help of the mute druid Mellthas; he and Sira develop a bond after experiencing a spiritual moment of communication between them. After preventing a conflict between the iskai and the humans, the group are brought to a meeting with a secret society called The Enlightened Ones, who offer to help Tom find the &quot;Toronto&quot;; Rainer, interested by this group, leaves to study with them, leaving Tom to take assistance from an Enlightened called Harriet.

Learning the ship landed in a desert near to a city of humans, Tom makes his way to its location with his friends to hopefully stop them mining the planet. Upon encountering an unmanned shuttle that lands upon finding him, Tom is abducted by the craft and knocked out. When he comes to aboard the &quot;Toronto&quot;, he finds the captain, Brandt, has declared him mentally unwell; no one aboard the craft are aware the planet is teeming with life. Detained in the medical wing of the newly formed colony, Tom is freed by his friend Joe, a technician, who reveals he has become suspicious of Brandt&#x27;s and Ned&#x27;s recent actions, along with the explosion in the communication room. Agreeing to help him, Joe joins Tom in trying to sabotage the AI&#x27;s systems, but both are forced to flee from the &quot;Toronto&quot; when they learn Ned intends to go ahead with the mining operation, having suppressed all data on the planet&#x27;s true condition.

Reuniting with his friends, Tom discusses the situation with the Enlightened Ones. Fearful the &quot;Toronto&quot; will kill the entity that resides in the planet, they propose a plan of creating a weapon called &quot;The Seed&quot;, which Rainer reveals will need to be put into the colony&#x27;s fusion reactor to shut it down. Seeking knowledge required to forge the weapon, Tom eventually leads an assault on the &quot;Toronto&quot;, dealing with Ned&#x27;s security measures and informing the colonists about the truth concerning Albion; they eventually abandon the colony. Confronting the AI, the group manage to use the weapon, destroying Ned and transforming the colony into a giant utopia of plant life. Tom, relieved the situation is resolved, decides the group&#x27;s next job is to inform the human colonists that they must now make a new life on Albion.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;, Michael Wolf called &quot;Albion&quot; &quot;a fun, engrossing, and involved roleplaying experience&quot;, with &quot;all the elements of a great roleplaying adventure.&quot; In &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Petra Schlunk wrote, &quot;I found this lengthy game enjoyable to play and recommend it to lovers of role-playing games when another dry spell hits.&quot; The game was a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1996 &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; called &quot;Albion&quot; &quot;well-thought out and definitely worth checking out&quot;, and praised it as a &quot;bright spot in the desert&quot; of computer role-playing games at the time.

Chuck Klimushyn of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; considered &quot;Albion&quot; to be &quot;a breath of fresh air for the RPG crowd&quot;, and he wrote that &quot;those who cut their teeth on the likes of &quot;Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Wizardry&quot;, and &quot;Ultima&quot; may find that the future looks a little brighter because of this latest offering from Blue Byte.&quot; The magazine later nominated &quot;Albion&quot; as its 1996 role-playing game of the year.

&quot;Albion&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Game Entertainment&quot;″s 1996 &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; prize. The magazine&#x27;s editors wrote, &quot;&quot;Albion&quot; was refreshing, not only because it helped fill a void, but because it carefully balanced story, puzzles, combat and exploration.&quot; It was also nominated in this category by CNET Gamecenter, whose editors gave the prize to &quot;Meridian 59&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2011 a port for ARM architecture and the Pandora handheld was created by fans via static recompilation from the original x86 binary executable. The community still updates this recompiled version and released also a Windows and Linux build in 2015.

On July 29, 2015, Albion was re-released on the digital distributor GOG.com, albeit only the original version and DOSBox, not the newer port.

<text>The architecture of England is the architecture of the historic Kingdom of England up to 1707, and of England since then, but is deemed to include buildings created under English influence or by English architects in other parts of the world, particularly in the English overseas possessions and the later British Empire, which developed into the present-day Commonwealth of Nations.

Apart from Anglo-Saxon architecture, the major non-vernacular forms employed in England before 1900 originated elsewhere in western Europe, chiefly in France and Italy, while 20th-century Modernist architecture derived from both European and American influences. Each of these foreign modes became assimilated within English architectural culture and gave rise to local variation and innovation, producing distinctive national forms. Among the most characteristic styles originating in England are the Perpendicular Gothic of the late Middle Ages, High Victorian Gothic and the Queen Anne style.

==Prehistoric architecture==

The earliest known examples of architecture in England are the megalithic tombs of the Neolithic, such as those at Wayland&#x27;s Smithy and the West Kennet Long Barrow. These &quot;cromlechi&quot; are common over much of Atlantic Europe: present day Spain; Brittany; Great Britain; and Ireland. Radiocarbon dating has shown them to be, as historian John Davies says, &quot;the first substantial, permanent constructions of man and that the earliest of them are nearly 1,500 years older than the first of the pyramids of Egypt.&quot; The Neolithic henges of Avebury and Stonehenge are two of the largest and most famous megalithic monuments in the world. The structure is an annual calendar, but the reason for the massive size is unknown with any certainty, suggestions include agriculture, ceremonial use and interpreting the cosmos. With other nearby sites, including Silbury Hill, Beckhampton Avenue, and West Kennet Avenue, they form a UNESCO World Heritage Site called Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites.

Numerous examples of Bronze Age and Iron Age architecture can be seen in England. Megalithic burial monuments, either individual barrows (also known, and marked on modern British Ordnance Survey maps, as Tumuli,) or occasionally cists covered by cairns, are one form. The other is the defensive earthworks known as hill forts, such as Maiden Castle and Cadbury Castle. Archaeological evidence suggests that British Iron Age domestic architecture had a tendency towards circular dwellings, known as roundhouses.

==Roman architecture==
The Roman period brought the construction of the first large-scale buildings in Britain, but very little survives above ground besides fortifications. These include sections of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, Chester city walls and coastal forts such as those at Portchester, Pevensey and Burgh Castle, which have survived through incorporation into later castles. Other structures still standing include a lighthouse at Dover Castle, now part of a church. In most cases, only foundations, floors and the bases of walls attest to the structure of former buildings. Some of these were on a grand scale, such as the palace at Fishbourne and the &quot;thermae&quot; at Bath. The more substantial buildings of the Roman period adhered closely to the style of Roman structures elsewhere, although traditional Iron Age building methods remained in general use for humbler dwellings, especially in rural areas.

==Medieval architecture==

===Anglo-Saxon architecture===

Architecture of the Anglo-Saxon period exists only in the form of churches, the only structures commonly built in stone apart from fortifications. The earliest examples date from the 7th century, notably at Bradwell-on-Sea and Escomb, but the majority from the 10th and 11th centuries. Due to the systematic destruction and replacement of English cathedrals and monasteries by the Normans, no major Anglo-Saxon churches survive; the largest extant example is at Brixworth.

The main material is ashlar masonry, sometimes accompanied by details in reused Roman brick. Anglo-Saxon churches are typically high and narrow and consist of a nave and a narrower chancel; these are often accompanied by a west tower. Some feature &quot;porticus&quot; (projecting chambers) to the west or to the north and south, creating a cruciform plan. Characteristic features include quoins in &quot;long-and-short work&quot; (alternating vertical and horizontal blocks) and small windows with rounded or triangular tops, deeply splayed or in groups of two or three divided by squat columns. The most common form of external decoration is lesene strips (thin vertical or horizontal strips of projecting stone), typically combined with blind arcading. Notable examples of this exist at Earls Barton, Bradford-on-Avon and Barton-upon-Humber.

===Norman architecture===
In the 11th century the Normans were among Europe&#x27;s leading exponents of Romanesque architecture, a style which had begun to influence English church building before 1066, but became the predominant mode in England with the huge wave of construction that followed the Norman Conquest. The Normans destroyed a large proportion of England&#x27;s churches and built Romanesque replacements, a process which encompassed all of England&#x27;s cathedrals. Most of the latter were later partially or wholly rebuilt in Gothic style, and although many still preserve substantial Romanesque portions, only Durham Cathedral remains a predominantly Romanesque structure (along with St Alban&#x27;s and Southwell, abbey churches in the medieval period). Even Durham displays significant transitional features leading towards the emergence of Gothic. Romanesque churches are characterised by rounded arches, arcades supported by massive cylindrical piers, groin vaults and low-relief sculptural decoration. Distinctively Norman features include decorative chevron patterns.

In the wake of the invasion William I and his lords built numerous wooden motte-and-bailey castles to impose their control on the native population. Many were subsequently rebuilt in stone, beginning with the Tower of London.
There are also a very small number of domestic Norman buildings still standing, for example Jew&#x27;s House, Lincoln; manor houses at Saltford and Boothby Pagnall; and fortified manor houses such as Oakham Castle.
=== Gothic architecture ===

The major buildings of the Late Middle Ages and the first centuries of the Early Modern Period were constructed in the predominant late medieval European style of Gothic architecture. Art-historical periodisations are Early English or &quot;First Pointed&quot; (late 12th–late 13th centuries), Decorated Gothic or &quot;Second Pointed&quot; (late 13th–late 14th centuries), and Perpendicular Gothic or &quot;Third Pointed&quot; (14th–17th centuries). The architect and art historian Thomas Rickman&#x27;s &quot;Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England&quot;, first published in 1812, divided Gothic architecture in the British Isles into three stylistic periods. Rickman identified the period of architecture from William the Conqueror () to Henry II () as &quot;Norman&quot;; from Richard the Lionheart () to Edward I () as &quot;Early English&quot;; the reigns of Edward II () and Edward III () as &quot;Decorated&quot;, and from Richard II () to Henry VIII () as &quot;Perpendicular&quot;.

From the 15th century, under the House of Tudor, the prevailing Gothic style is commonly known as Tudor architecture, being ultimately succeeded by Elizabethan architecture and Renaissance architecture under Elizabeth I (). Rickman excluded from his scheme most new buildings after Henry VIII&#x27;s reign, calling the style of &quot;additions and rebuilding&quot; in the later 16th and earlier 17th centuries &quot;often much debased&quot;. Architect and art historian Edmund Sharpe published in 1851 &quot;The Seven Periods of English Architecture&quot;, in which he identified a pre-Gothic &quot;Transitional Period&quot; (1145–90) after the &quot;Norman&quot; period, in which pointed arches and round arches were employed together. Focusing on the windows, Sharpe dubbed Rickman&#x27;s first Gothic style the &quot;Lancet Period&quot; (1190–1245); divided the second into first the &quot;Geometrical&quot; (1245–1315) and then the &quot;Curvilinear&quot; (1315–1360); and named the third style &quot;Rectilinear&quot; (1360–1550).

This last Gothic style was typified by large windows, four-centred arches, straight vertical and horizontal lines in the tracery, and regular arch-topped rectangular panelling. Perpendicular was the prevailing style of Late Gothic architecture in England from the 14th century to the 17th century. Perpendicular was unique to the country: no equivalent arose in Continental Europe or elsewhere in the British Isles. Of all the Gothic architectural styles, Perpendicular was the first to experience a second wave of popularity from the 18th century on in Gothic Revival architecture.

=== Vernacular architecture ===

Little survives of the vernacular architecture of the medieval period due to the use of perishable materials for the great majority of buildings. Most domestic buildings were built on timber frames, usually with wattle and daub infill. Roofs were typically covered with thatch; wooden shingles were also employed, and from the 12th century tile and slate came into use in some areas. Also around the 12th century, the cruck frame was introduced, increasing the size of timber-framed vernacular buildings. Typically, larger houses of this period were based around a great hall open from floor to roof. One bay at each end was split into two storeys and used for service rooms and private rooms for the owner. Even quite high up the social scale houses were small by modern standards, except for the very wealthy.

Buildings surviving from this period included moated manor houses of which Ightham Mote is a notable late medieval example, and Wealden hall houses such as Alfriston Clergy House. Tintagel Old Post Office is a 14th-century manor house in a part of the country where stone was the typical building material for better houses. Little Moreton Hall, a large manor house begun in 1504-08 and later extended, is a famous showpiece of decorative half-timbering. Near the dangerous Scottish border, the peel tower was a type of tower house or small castle; in Scotland they were even more common. The bastle house was a two-storey version, continuing what had been a common form of house for the better-off across the country in the late Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods.

==Tudor transition==
The Tudor period constitutes a transitional phase, in which the organic continuity and technical innovation of the medieval era gave way to centuries in which architecture was dominated by a succession of attempts to revive earlier styles.

The Perpendicular Gothic style reached its culmination in the reign of Henry VII and the early years of Henry VIII, with the construction of King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge and Henry VII&#x27;s Chapel at Westminster Abbey. However, the Reformation brought an effective halt to church-building in England which continued in most parts of the country until the 19th century.

By the time of Henry VII&#x27;s accession castle-building in England had come to an end and under the Tudors ostentatious unfortified country houses and palaces became widespread, built either in stone or in brick, which first became a common building material in England in this period. Characteristic features of the early Tudor style included imposing gatehouses (a vestige of the castle), flattened pointed arches in the Perpendicular Gothic manner, square-headed windows, decoratively shaped gables and large ornate chimneys. Outstanding surviving examples of early Tudor palatial architecture include Hampton Court Palace and Layer Marney Tower.

Over the course of the 16th century Classical features derived from the Renaissance architecture of Italy exerted an increasing influence, initially on surface decoration but in time shaping the entire design of buildings, while the use of medieval features declined. This development gave rise to palatial stone dwellings or prodigy houses such as Hardwick Hall and Montacute House.

==Style revivals==

===Stuart architecture===
During the 17th century, the continuing advance of Classical forms overrode the eclecticism of English Renaissance architecture, which gave way to a more uniform style derived from continental models, chiefly from Italy. This entailed a retreat from the structural sophistication of Gothic architecture to forms derived from the more primitive construction methods of Classical antiquity. The style was typified by square or round-headed windows and doors, flat ceilings, colonnades, pilasters, pediments and domes. Classical architecture in England tended to be relatively plain and simple in comparison with the contemporaneous Baroque architecture of the continent, being influenced above all by the Palladian style of Italy. This was first introduced to England by Inigo Jones and typified by his Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich.
The Great Fire of London in 1666 forced the reconstruction of much of the city, which was the only part of the country to see a significant amount of church-building between the Reformation and the 19th century. Sir Christopher Wren was employed to replace many of the destroyed churches, but his master plan for rebuilding London as a whole was rejected. Wren&#x27;s churches exemplify the distinctive English approach to church-building in the Classical manner, which largely rejected the domes that typified the continental Baroque and employed a wide range of different forms of steeple, experimental efforts to find a substitute for the Gothic spire within a Classical mode. However, a dome featured very prominently in Wren&#x27;s grandest construction, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the only English cathedral in any permutation of the Classical tradition.

The later 17th century saw Baroque architecture – a version of Classicism characterised by heavy massing and ostentatiously elaborate decoration – become widespread in England. Grand Baroque-style country houses began to appear in England during the 1690s, exemplified by Chatsworth House and Castle Howard. The most significant English Baroque architects after Wren were Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, who adapted the Baroque style to fit English tastes in houses such as Blenheim Palace, Seaton Delaval Hall and Easton Neston.

===Georgian architecture===
The 18th century saw a turn away from Baroque elaboration and a reversion to a more austere approach to Classicism. This shift initially brought a return to the Italian Palladianism that had characterised the earliest manifestations of Classical architecture in England. Later Neoclassical architecture increasingly idealised ancient Greek forms, which were viewed as representing Classicism in its original &quot;purity&quot;, as against Roman forms. Country houses representing this style include Woburn Abbey and Kedleston Hall. This period also saw the emergence of an increasingly planned approach to urban expansion, and the systematic, simultaneous construction of whole streets or squares, or even of entire districts, gave rise to new forms of domestic construction, the terrace and the crescent, as exemplified in Bath and in Bloomsbury and Mayfair in London. Among the notable architects practising in this era were Robert Adam, Sir William Chambers, John Wood and James Wyatt.

===Victorian architecture===
The 19th century saw a fragmentation of English architecture, as Classical forms continued in widespread use but were challenged by a series of distinctively English revivals of other styles, drawing chiefly on Gothic, Renaissance and vernacular traditions but incorporating other elements as well. This ongoing historicism was counterposed by a resumption of technical innovation, which had been largely in abeyance since the Renaissance but was now fuelled by new materials and techniques derived from the Industrial Revolution, particularly the use of iron and steel frames, and by the demand for new types of building. The rapid growth and urbanisation of the population entailed an immense amount of new domestic and commercial construction, while the same processes combined with a religious revival to bring about a resumption of widespread church building. Mechanised manufacturing, railways and public utilities required new forms of building, while the new industrial cities invested heavily in grand civic buildings and the huge expansion and diversification of educational, cultural and leisure activities likewise created new demands on architecture.

The Gothic revival was a development which emerged in England and whose influence, except in church building, was largely restricted to the English-speaking world. It had begun on a small scale in the 18th century under the stimulus of Romanticism, a trend initiated by Horace Walpole&#x27;s house Strawberry Hill. However, widespread Gothic construction began only in the 19th century, led by the renewal of church building but spreading to secular construction. Early Gothic revival architecture was whimsical and unsystematic, but in the Victorian era the revival developed an abstract rigour and became a movement driven by cultural, religious and social concerns which extended far beyond architecture, seeing the Gothic style and the medieval way of life as a route to the spiritual regeneration of society. The first great ideologue of this movement was Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, who together with Charles Barry designed the new Houses of Parliament, the grandest work of Victorian Gothic architecture.
The Parliament building&#x27;s Perpendicular style reflects the predominance of the later forms of English Gothic in the early Victorian period, but this later gave way to a preference for plain Early English or French Gothic, and above all to a style derived from the architecture of medieval Italy and the Low Countries. This High Victorian Gothic was driven chiefly by the writings of John Ruskin, based on his observations of the buildings of Venice, while its archetypal practitioner was the church architect William Butterfield. It was characterised by heavy massing, sparse use of tracery or sculptural decoration and an emphasis on polychrome patterning created through the use of different colours of brick and stone. The Gothic revival also drove a widespread effort to restore deteriorating medieval churches, a practice which often went beyond restoration to involve extensive reconstruction. The most active exponent of this activity was also the most prolific designer of new Gothic buildings, George Gilbert Scott, whose work is exemplified by St Pancras Station. Other leading Victorian Gothic architects included G. E. Street, J. F. Pearson and G. F. Bodley.

The Victorian period saw a revival of interest in English vernacular building traditions, focusing chiefly on domestic architecture and employing features such as half-timbering and tile-hanging, whose leading practitioner was Richard Norman Shaw. This development too was shaped by much wider ideological considerations, strongly influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement. While its ethos shared much with the Gothic revival, its preoccupations were less religious and were connected with romantic socialism and a distaste for industrialisation and urban life. On the other hand, British industrial architecture both revived old styles and developed new ones. In the later 19th century vernacular elements mingled with forms drawn from the Renaissance architecture of England and the Low Countries to produce a synthesis dubbed the Queen Anne Style, which in fact bore very little resemblance to the architecture of that reign. While some architects of the period were ideologically committed to a particular manner, a tendency personified by Pugin, others were happy to move between styles. An exemplar of this approach was Alfred Waterhouse, whose works included buildings in Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles and eclectic fusions between them.

The new technology of iron and steel frame construction exerted an influence over many forms of building, although its use was often masked by traditional forms. It was highly prominent in two of the new forms of building that characterised Victorian architecture, railway station train sheds and glasshouses. The greatest exponent of the latter was Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace.

In the 18th century a few English architects had emigrated to the colonies, but as the British Empire became firmly established in the 19th century many architects at the start of their careers made the decision to emigrate, several chose the United States but most went to Canada, Australia or New Zealand, as opportunities arose to meet the growing demand for buildings in these countries. Normally they adopted the style of architecture fashionable when they left England, though by the latter half of the century, improving transport and communications meant that even quite remote parts of the Empire had access to many publications, such as The Builder magazine. This enabled colonial architects to stay abreast of current fashion. Thus the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several prominent 19th century architects produced designs that were executed by architects in the various colonies. For example, Sir George Gilbert Scott designed Bombay University &amp; William Butterfield designed St Peter&#x27;s Cathedral, Adelaide.

===Historical styles in the 20th century===
The last great exponent of late Victorian free Renaissance eclecticism was Edwin Lutyens, and his shift into the Classical mode after 1900 symbolised a wider retreat from the stylistic ferment of the 19th century to a plain and homogenous Classicism based on Georgian exemplars, an approach followed by many architects of the early 20th century, notably Herbert Baker and Reginald Blomfield. This Neo-Georgian manner, while not greatly favoured in later decades by the architectural profession or architecture critics, has remained popular with clients and conservative commentators, notably Charles, Prince of Wales. Domestic architecture throughout the 20th century and beyond has continued to be strongly influenced by a homogenised version of Victorian vernacular revival styles. Some architects responded to modernism, and economic circumstances, by producing stripped-down versions of traditional styles; the work of Giles Gilbert Scott illustrates this well.

==Modern architecture==

===International Style===
The International Style (also known as Modernism) emerged as a reaction against the world before the First World War, including historical architectural styles. Stylistically it was functional, drawing upon objects that were designed for a specific purpose such as Oceanliners. It emerged as an idea from continental Europe, but was of interest to some English architects. However it the arrival of emigre architects such as Mendelsohn and Lubetkin that galvanised the position of modern architecture within England.

The bombing of English cities created a housing shortage, in the post war years. To meet this many thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of council houses in mock-vernacular style were built, giving working class people their first experience of private gardens and indoor sanitation. The demand was partly sated through the pre-fabrication of buildings within factories, giving rise to the &quot;Pre-fab&quot; .

===Brutalist architecture===

The reconstruction that followed the Second World War had a major impact upon English architecture. The austerity that followed the WWII meant that cost dictated many design decisions, however significant architectural movements emerged. One such movement was the native development of Brutalism. Its look was created though the desire to express how buildings were constructed, for example through the use of exposed concrete. Significant &quot;New Brutalist&quot; buildings were the Economist Building, the Hayward Gallery, the Barbican Arts Centre and the Royal National Theatre.

===High-tech architecture===
High-tech architecture emerged as an attempt to revitalise the language of Modernism, it drew inspiration from technology to create new architectural expression . The theorical work of Archigram provided significant inspiration of the High-tec movement. High-tech architecture is mostly associated with non-domestic buildings, perhaps due to the technological imagery. The two most prominent proponents were Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Rogers&#x27; most iconic English building is the Lloyd&#x27;s building, situated nearby is Foster&#x27;s most famous 30 St Mary Axe building (nicknamed &quot;The Gherkin&quot;). Their respective influence continues into the current century.

===Postmodern architecture===
Postmodern architecture also emerged as an attempt to enrich Modern architecture. It was especially fashionable in the 1980s, when Modernism had fallen from favour, being associated with the welfare state. Many shopping malls and office complexes for example Broadgate used this style. Notable practitioners were James Stirling and Terry Farrell, although Farrell returned to modernism in the 1990s. A significant example of postmodernism is Robert Venturi&#x27;s Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery.

===Contemporary architecture===
Significant recent buildings, in a variety of styles, include: Will Alsop: Peckham Library, North Greenwich tube station; David Chipperfield: River and Rowing Museum, Hepworth Wakefield; Future Systems: Lord&#x27;s Media Centre, Selfridges Building, Birmingham; Zaha Hadid, London Aquatics Centre; Ian Simpson: Beetham Tower, Manchester, Beetham Tower, Birmingham.

<text>The Commander was a Norton motorcycle with a Wankel rotary engine.

The first Norton Wankel motorcycle was the 1987 Classic using an air-cooled engine, built as a special edition of just 100 machines. It was followed by the air-cooled Interpol 2 model.

The Commander was a liquid-cooled successor to the Interpol 2, liquid cooling being adopted for greater power and reliability. The Commander&#x27;s final-drive chain was protected by a full enclosure. Some cycle parts (such as wheels, forks, switchgear, clocks &amp; brakes) were bought-in Yamaha items from the XJ900.

Two types of Commander were built. The P52 was a single-seat model equipped for police use. The second was the dual-seat P53 civilian tourer. Both the P52 and P53 had panniers integral with their fibreglass bodywork. The P53 bodywork was later revised to have detachable K2 panniers.

<doc id="1194899" wikidata="Q359108" url="?curid=1194899" title="Tudor Vladimirescu">
<text>Tudor Vladimirescu (; c. 1780 – ) was a Romanian revolutionary hero, the leader of the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and of the Pandur militia. He is also known as Tudor din Vladimiri (&quot;Tudor from Vladimiri&quot;) or, occasionally, as Domnul Tudor (&quot;Voivode Tudor&quot;).

==Background==
Tudor was born in Vladimiri, Gorj County (in the region of Oltenia) in a family of landed peasants (&quot;mazili&quot;); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to Craiova, in service to boyar Ioan Glogoveanu, where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the Greek language. He became administrator of the boyar&#x27;s estate and, in 1806, was named &quot;vătaf&quot; (leader of the local militias) at Cloșani. Tudor&#x27;s experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped him walk the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the Phanariotes. While leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, punishing any destruction of property.

Tudor enrolled in the Russian army and took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812. Consequently, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 3rd degree and given Russian protection and immunity from prosecution under both Wallachian and Ottoman legislation (&quot;see Sudiți&quot;). This contributed to Tudor&#x27;s decisions throughout the uprising, alongside his belief that Russia was backing his actions. After the war, Tudor returned to Oltenia. He traveled briefly to Vienna, in 1814, in order to attend a lawsuit involving Glogoveanu&#x27;s wife&#x27;s patrimony. The trip coincided with the Peace Congress, and it is believed that Vladimirescu followed the treaties&#x27; outcome.

Back in the country in 1815, Tudor learned that Ada Kaleh Ottoman garrison, who roamed Mehedinți and Gorj, had also destroyed his household from Cerneți.

From 1812 to 1821, Vladimirescu slowly built a follower base. The Pandurs respected his military skills, and many sources point out his charisma and outstanding negotiating abilities. He would also have been familiarised with the outcomes of the First and Second Serbian Uprising.

==Uprising==
Prince Alexandros Soutzos&#x27; death in January 1821 led to the forming of a temporary &quot;Comitet de Ocârmuire&quot; (&quot;Governing Committee&quot;), three regents - all of them members of the most representative indigenous boyar families, of which the most prominent was &quot;Caimacam&quot; Grigore Brâncoveanu. The &quot;Comitet&quot;, motivated against competition and denied Phanariote rulers&#x27; favours, decided to quickly manoeuver anti-boyar and anti-Phanariote sentiment in Wallachia (and especially in Oltenia), acting before the newly appointed Scarlat Callimachi could claim his throne. Therefore, an agreement between it and the Pandurs was reached on the 15th: Dimitrie Macedonski was awarded the post of lieutenant to Tudor.

The very same day, Vladimirescu sent a letter to the Ottoman Court of Mahmud II, stating that his objective was not the rejection of Ottoman rule, but that of the Phanariote regime, and showing his willingness for preservation of the traditional institutions. The statements were meant to buy Tudor time against Ottoman response, as he was already in negotiations with the Greek Anti-Ottoman revolutionary society Philikí Etaireía (having probably been in contact with it from around 1819). Together, they produced a plan for insurrection, with the two Etairist representatives (Giorgakis Olympios and Iannis Pharmakis) assuring the Wallachians of Russian support for the common cause. It is apparent that Tudor was not himself a member of the Etaireía: the rigid command structure of the Brotherhood would have excluded the need for any negotiations.

After fortifying monasteries in Oltenia (Tismana, Strehaia) that were to serve him in the event of Ottoman intervention, Tudor travelled to Padeș where he issued his first proclamation (23 January). It included references to Enlightenment principles (notably, the right to resist oppression), but was also an almost millenarianist appeal to peasants, promising a &quot;spring&quot; to follow &quot;winter&quot;.

In February the demands were detailed by more documents. They included: the elimination of purchased offices in the administration, with the introduction of meritocratic promotion, the suppression of certain taxes and taxing criteria, the reduction of the main tax, the founding of a Wallachian Army, and an end to internal custom duties. In line with these, Tudor asked for the banishment of some Phanariote families and forbidding future Princes to hold a retinue that would compete with local boyars for offices. Calls by boyars in the Divan for Tudor to cease such activities (expressed by envoy Nicolae Văcărescu) were met with a vehement refusal.

The army, swelled up in numbers as it advanced, occupied Bucharest on 21 March - here, Tudor issued another important proclamation, one that expressed yet again his commitment to peace with the Ottomans. Previously, the Philikí Etaireía under Alexander Ypsilanti had emerged in Moldavia, proclaiming a liberation from Ottoman rule that was backed by the then Moldavian Prince Michael Soutzos (&quot;see Greek War of Independence&quot;). However, this coincided with Russian reaction against Greek rebellion, with the Russian army entering Moldavia and enforcing 
Holy Alliance policies. Ypsilanti&#x27;s army headed south, reaching Pandur-occupied Bucharest.

Tudor&#x27;s actions in the meanwhile had destroyed his alliance to local boyars. He had started wearing the &quot;kalpak&quot; (a tall, cylindrical, black leather hat; &quot;see Ottoman Clothing&quot;) reserved for the Prince, and demanded to be addressed as &quot;Domn&quot; (&quot;Master&quot;, &quot;Prince&quot;; cf. &quot;Domnitor&quot;) - moving away from subordination to the landowners&#x27; cause.

The meeting between Ypsilanti and Tudor brought a new compromise. Tudor considered himself liberated from the provisions of the January agreement, as Russia was now an enemy of the Etaireía; Ypsilanti tried to persuade him that Russian support was still possible. The country was divided into a Greek administration and a Wallachian one, with Tudor&#x27;s declaring itself neutral in the face of large Ottoman armies preparing to cross the north of the Danube. Ottoman actions had been prompted by Russian threat of intervention in Wallachia.

Tudor&#x27;s army retreated towards in Oltenia in May, as the Ottomans occupied Bucharest without meeting resistance. Tudor was no longer capable of maintaining the discipline and cohesion of his own troops, some of whom had resorted to robbery. In an attempt to ensure discipline, he imposed hangings of those found guilty. 
In the meantime, Etaireía members, led by Alexander Ypsilantis developed a plot to remove Tudor.

== Arrest and assassination ==
Following treason, Tudor was arrested in Golești on 21 May. On the night of 27 to 28 May, following accusations of collaboration with the Ottomans against Etaireía, he was tortured and killed by Etaireía in Târgoviște, his mutilated body being thrown into a cesspit. Tudor&#x27;s collaboration with the Ottomans was never confirmed. The Etaireía did not succeed in its goal to assume command of Vladimirescu&#x27;s army: most of it disbanded on the spot.

==Legacy==


Tudor&#x27;s rebellion ensured that Wallachia would stay under military occupation. Although the situation was stabilized by August, Ottoman troops remained until 1826. However, as they could no longer trust Phanariote rule in the face of its infiltration by Greek nationalism (Ypsilanti himself came from a Phanariote family - &quot;see Alexander Ypsilanti, his grandfather, and Constantine Ypsilanti, his father&quot;), the Ottomans returned the two Principalities to rule by and through locals (in 1822): Grigore IV Ghica in Wallachia, Ioan Sturdza (Ioniţă Sandu Sturdza) in Moldavia. The changes in the situation were to be confirmed by the Treaty of Adrianople and Russian occupation (at the end of the Russo-Turkish War).

Although the scope of his movement appealed to generations of Romanian nationalists, Tudor Vladimirescu&#x27;s most favorable treatment came with the official ideology of the &quot;Romanian People&#x27;s Republic&quot; (the first period of Communist Romania, lasting from 1948 to 1965). He was considered progressive, and it also contributed that he viewed himself as an ally to the Russian cause—almost as a precursor of the Soviet alliance. 
The Romanian film &quot;Tudor&quot; (1962) narrated his life from the return home in 1812 to his death. Tudor, portrayed by Emanoil Petruţ, falls from his horse after being shot in the back, claiming to return &quot;as the grass of spring&quot; - a far easier death than what Vladimirescu had endured in reality. 

A division bearing his name (&quot;Divizia Tudor Vladimirescu&quot;) was formed by the Red Army with Romanian prisoners of war who had fought on the Eastern Front. They were called on to fight the Ion Antonescu pro-Nazi Germany regime, and were absorbed into the Romanian Army after 1944. The division had its precedent in an artillery battery of the same name, grouping Romanian volunteers in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. An Order of Tudor Vladmirescu was also created. There are multiple streets and structures in Romania bearing his name, including a metro station in Bucharest. From its founding in 1951 to 1974, the Rocar factory in Bucharest was called the &quot;Tudor Vladimirescu Works&quot; and during this time the Tudor Vladimirescu van range (usually shortened to TV) was made from 1958 to 1996 along with a bus range from 1959 to 1976.

The day Vladimirescu entered Bucharest, 21 March, is now celebrated in Oltenia as Oltenia Day, which was promulgated on 13 April 2017 by the President of Romania Klaus Iohannis.

==Quotes==
*[In the Padeş proclamation:] &quot;&quot;There is no law that would prevent a man from meeting evil with evil.&quot;
*[To boyar Nicolae Văcărescu:] &quot;It seems to me that you sir consider the folk, whose blood has been feeding and giving lustre to all the boyar kin, to be in fact nothing, and that you only view the pillagers to be the motherland... But how come you sir do not consider the motherland to be in fact the people, and not the pillagers&#x27; clique?&quot;
*[To the Porte:] &quot;[The Wallachians have rebelled because] of the terrible sufferings they are caused by the union between the native boyars and those who have for long been sent as rulers and legislators of this people.&quot;
*[Answering Ypsilanti&#x27;s question regarding the liberty he had taken to govern in Bucharest:] &quot;[I act] on the basis of the right given to me by my own sword.&quot;&quot;

<text>The Hotel Julien Dubuque is a hotel located in downtown Dubuque, Iowa at Second and Main streets. The hotel currently has 133 guest rooms, Caroline&#x27;s restaurant, the Riverboat Lounge, the Potosa Spa, a pool and fitness center, and large banquet facilities. The interior redesign converted the existing 168 guest rooms into 133 luxury rooms and suites and restored the historic lobby and grand ballroom, while at the same time adding modern systems and amenities like a geothermal heating and cooling system, a reflective roof, a swimming pool and fitness facility. It was included as a contributing property in the Old Main Street Historic District in 1983 as the Julien Motor Inn.

==History==

The history of the Hotel Julien Dubuque can be traced back to 1839, when the first lodging establishment was built at Second and Main streets. At first, the hotel was called the Waples House. The Waples House was known for fine dining and extravagant furnishings. In 1854 the hotel was renamed the Julien House. The hotel was enlarged and refurbished. It&#x27;s believed that Abraham Lincoln stayed at the Julien House when he traveled to Galena, Illinois to attend to legal matters there. During the late 1800s, the hotel became a focal point of downtown Dubuque.

In 1913, the Julien House was destroyed by a fire - very little was left standing by the time the fire was over. Construction on the present building began soon after, and was completed in 1915.

During the time that Al Capone was the leader of the mob in Chicago, he reportedly owned the Julien. Capone supposedly had a fondness for Dubuque, and when he had trouble in Chicago Capone would come to Dubuque and use the Julien Inn as a retreat and hideout. Local lore says that he had an underground garage in the area in order to hide his personal cars so that he could better disguise his presence in the city.

Another famous guest of the Julien was Sylvester Stallone. Stallone stayed at the Julien Inn during the filming of the movie &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;

Louis Pfohl eventually purchased the hotel, and remodeled the building. He was responsible for many of the features found in the hotel, such as the mirrored staircase leading from the lobby to the second floor.

The Julien Inn is currently owned by the Fischer Companies - a company that owns a number of buildings in Dubuque. In 2007, the Fischer Companies began further renovation, intending to restore the building&#x27;s exterior to its original appearance, plus renovating the interior of the hotel. As part of the renovation, the hotel also received a new name: Hotel Julien Dubuque. The renovation is now complete and the hotel reopened in Summer 2009.

<doc id="1194909" wikidata="Q815233" url="?curid=1194909" title="Siege of Tyre (332 BC)">
<text>The siege of Tyre was orchestrated by Alexander the Great in 332 BC during his campaigns against the Persians. The Macedonian army was unable to capture the city, which was a strategic coastal base on the Mediterranean Sea, through conventional means because it was on an island and had walls right up to the sea. Alexander responded to this problem by first blockading and besieging Tyre for seven months, and then by building a causeway and placing siege towers with catapults built on top at the end after his soldiers discovered that they could not extend it any further due to a steep drop under the surface of the water. This allowed him to breach the fortifications.

It is said that Alexander was so enraged at the Tyrians&#x27; defence of their city and the loss of his men that he destroyed half the city. According to Arrian, 8,000 Tyrian civilians were massacred after the city fell. Alexander granted pardon to all who had sought sanctuary in the temple, including Azemilcus and his family, as well as many nobles. 30,000 residents and foreigners, mainly women and children, were sold into slavery.

==Location==
Tyre, the largest and most important city-state of Phoenicia, was located both on the Mediterranean coast as well as a nearby island with two natural harbours on the landward side. The island lay about a kilometre from the coast in Alexander’s days, its high walls reaching above the sea on the eastern, landward facing, side of the island.

The location of Tyre was ideal for the seafaring habits of the Phoenician people, but also proved to make it hard to attack. The matchup between Alexander the Great’s army and the forces of a Phoenician city state might sound like an unfair fight, but Tyre’s logistics made for a long and grueling siege. Tyre’s split location between an island about half a mile off the coast of present day Lebanon and the mainland makes it challenging to strategize against. The Tyrian people were also skilled fighters, and they used their surroundings to their advantage. The Tyrian navy was known as very disciplined and skilled at warfare on the sea, an area that Alexander’s army was not as talented in. Many ancient civilizations have set their eyes on Tyre. Perhaps they saw potential in the city; it could serve as an important naval base. Alexander the Great, a man praised for his military prowess, wanted to see if he could assert his dominance over the entire Mediterranean region before any other civilizations captured the city. Tyre was also a prosperous city, with a great deal of wealth among the population. Tyre was a crucial port city in the Mediterranean trade network, fostering the movement of goods, ideas, and people. Alexander the Great saw an opportunity to get involved in trade routes that would probably be beneficial to his people. Phoenician city states at the time were not tightly bound to each other; they worked together but mostly existed independently. Alexander the Great would not have to worry so much about other parties getting involved in the conflict. 

==Background==
At the time of the siege, the city held approximately 40,000 people, though the women and children had been evacuated to Carthage, the former Phoenician colony and then Mediterranean power. The Carthaginians also promised to send a fleet to their mother city’s aid. As Alexander did not have access to his own navy, he resolved to take the city and thus deny the Persians their last harbour in the region.

Alexander knew of a temple to Melqart, whom he identified with Heracles, within the new city walls and informed the inhabitants that they would be spared if he were allowed to make a sacrifice in the temple (the old port had been abandoned and the Tyrians were now living on an offshore island a kilometre from the mainland). The defenders refused to allow this and suggested he use the temple on the mainland, saying that they would not let Persians or Macedonians within their new city. A second attempt at negotiation resulted in Alexander&#x27;s representatives being killed and then thrown from the walls into the sea. Alexander was enraged at the Tyrian defiance and ordered the siege to commence.

==Siege==
As Alexander could not attack the city from the sea, he built a kilometre-long two hundred foot-wide causeway (claimed so by Diodorus) stretching out to the island on a natural land bridge no more than two meters deep.

This causeway allowed his artillery to get in range of the walls, and is still there to this day, as it was made of stone. As the work came near the city walls, however, the water became much deeper, and the combined attacks from the walls and Tyrian navy made construction nearly impossible. Therefore, Alexander constructed two towers high and moved them to the end of the causeway. Like most of Alexander’s siege towers, these were moving artillery platforms, with catapults on the top to clear defenders off the walls, and ballista below to hurl rocks at the wall and attacking ships. The towers were made of wood, but were covered in rawhide to protect them from fire arrows. Although these towers were possibly the largest of their kind ever made, the Tyrians quickly devised a counter-attack. They used an old horse transport ship, filling it with dried branches, pitch, sulphur, and various other combustibles. They then hung cauldrons of oil from the masts, so that they would fall onto the deck once the masts burned through. They also weighed down the back of the ship so that the front rose above the water. They then set the ship on fire and ran it up onto the causeway. The fire spread quickly, engulfing both towers and other siege equipment that had been brought up. The Tyrian ships swarmed the pier, destroying any siege equipment that hadn’t caught fire, and driving off Macedonian crews who were trying to put out the fires.

After this setback, Alexander was convinced that he would not be able to take Tyre without a navy. Fortunately for Alexander, his previous victory at Issus and subsequent conquests of the Phoenician city states of Byblos, Arwad and Sidon had meant that the fleets of these cities, which had composed most of the Persian navy, came under his banner. This immediately gave him command of a fleet of 80 ships. This development coincided also with the arrival of 120 war galleys sent by the king of Cyprus, who had heard of his victories and wished to join him. With the arrival of another 23 ships from the Greek city states of Ionia, Alexander had 223 galleys under his command, giving him command of the sea. Along with the navy he broadened the width of his mole to allow for more defensive engines to provide proper protection from the Tyrians.

With his new fleet, Alexander&#x27;s forces sailed on Tyre and quickly blockaded both ports with its superior numbers. Alexander had several of the slower galleys and a few barges refitted with battering rams. Finding that large underwater blocks of stone kept the rams from reaching the walls, Alexander had them removed by crane ships. The rams were then anchored near the walls, but the Tyrians sent out ships and divers to cut the anchor cables. Alexander responded by replacing the cables with chains.

The Tyrians launched another counter-attack, but according to Arrian, were not so fortunate this time. The surprise attack went well initially. They noticed that Alexander returned to the mainland at the same time every afternoon for a meal and a rest along with much of his navy. The Tyrians were upon the engineers and builders on the mole before they had to time to react. They slaughtered many soldiers before they were held by the remaining sailors until backup arrived and the attack was pushed back. For some reason on this day, Alexander had skipped his afternoon nap, and sailed around the city to capture those of the attacking force that had made an attempt to retreat.

==Conclusion of the siege==
Alexander started testing the wall at various points with his rams, until the rams made a small breach in the south end of the island. He then coordinated an attack across the breach with a bombardment from all sides by his navy. Alexander is said to have personally taken part in the attack on the city, fighting from the top of a siege tower. Once his troops forced their way into the city, they easily overtook the garrison, and quickly captured the city.

Those citizens who took shelter in the temple of Melqart were pardoned by Alexander, including the king of Tyre. According to Quintus Curtius Rufus 6,000 fighting men were killed within the city and 2,000 Tyrians were crucified on the beach. The others, some 30,000 people, were sold into slavery. The severity of reprisals reflected the length of the siege and Alexander&#x27;s response to the Tyrians having executed some of his soldiers on the walls, in sight of the attackers.

Following the capture of Tyre, Alexander moved south to attack Gaza.

==Alternative conclusion==
Polyaenus the Macedonian, in one of the two stratagems he gives about Alexander&#x27;s siege of Tyre, provides a different account of Alexander’s conquest of the city. According to him, Alexander had marched into Arabia having left Parmenion in charge of the besieging force. The Tyrians found the courage to exit their walls and engage the Greeks, often beating them in various skirmishes. Alexander was informed and hurried back, reaching the city exactly when the Tyrians were fighting against a retreating Parmenion. Instead of attacking the Tyrians, he chose to march directly to the city, which he immediately took by force surprising its remaining garrison. Another view is that Alexander was so incensed at having to build a bridge to take the city of Tyre that he decided to kill or enslave most of Tyre&#x27;s population.

<doc id="1194915" wikidata="Q704766" url="?curid=1194915" title="China Airlines Flight 358">
<text>China Airlines Flight 358 was a Boeing 747-2R7F/SCD freighter that crashed on December 29, 1991, shortly after takeoff from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport near Taipei, Taiwan. All five crew members were killed.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft was a Boeing 747-2R7F/SCD, built in September 1980 for Cargolux as the &quot;City of Esch-sur-Alzette,&quot; registration LX-ECV, MSN 22390. It was acquired by China Airlines in June 1985 was given its registration of B-198. It had been in service for 11 years, 3 months. The aircraft had clocked a total of 45,868 hours of flight time during its time in service. The last A-check maintenance had occurred on 21 December 1991, and the aircraft had accumulated 74 hours of flight time since that point.

The aircraft was the same one involved in the China Airlines Flight 334 hijacking on 3 May 1986.

== Accident ==
Several minutes after takeoff, the crew reported problems with the #2 engine, prompting Taipei air traffic control (ATC) to vector the flight into a left turn to return to the airport. Approximately two minutes later, the crew reported that they were unable to turn left, and ATC approved a right-hand turn instead. This was the last radio contact made by the crew. The crew lost control of the aircraft and it struck a hill, right wing first, near Wanli, Taipei. The crash occurred at approximately 3:05 p.m, at an altitude of . All five crew members died in the crash, and there were no injuries on the ground.

== Investigation ==
The subsequent investigation revealed that the number 3 engine and its pylon had separated from the aircraft and struck the number 4 engine, breaking it off the wing as well. A more detailed investigation revealed that the pylon midspar fittings, which attach the pylon to the lower portion of the wing front spar, had failed. The search for the number 3 engine and its pylon, which landed in the sea, took several months.

Information from the investigation of this crash and the nearly identical crash of El Al Flight 1862 ten months later resulted in Boeing ordering pylon modifications to every 747 in use.

<doc id="1194919" wikidata="Q762203" url="?curid=1194919" title="The Professor (novel)">
<text>The Professor, A Tale. was the first novel by English author Charlotte Brontë. It was written in 1846 before &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, but was rejected by many publishing houses. It was eventually published, posthumously, in 1857, with the approval of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s widower, Arthur Bell Nicholls, who took on the task of reviewing and editing the text.

==Plot==
The novel is the story of a young man, William Crimsworth, and is a first-person narrative from his perspective. It describes his maturation, his career as a teacher in Brussels, and his personal relationships.

The story starts with a letter William has sent to his friend Charles, detailing his rejection of his uncle&#x27;s proposal that he become a clergyman, as well as his first meeting with his rich brother Edward. Seeking work as a tradesman, William is offered the position of a clerk by Edward. However, Edward is jealous of William&#x27;s education and intelligence, and treats him terribly. Through the actions of the sympathetic Mr Hunsden, William is relieved of his post, but starts a new job at a boys&#x27; boarding school in Belgium.

The school is run by the friendly Monsieur Pelet, who treats William kindly and politely. Soon William&#x27;s merits as a &quot;professor&quot; reach the ears of the headmistress of the neighbouring girls&#x27; school. Mademoiselle Reuter offers him a position at her school, which he accepts. Initially captivated by her, William begins to entertain ideas of falling in love with her, but then he overhears her and Monsieur Pelet talking about their upcoming marriage and their deceitful treatment of him.

William begins to treat Mademoiselle Reuter with cold civility as he sees her underlying nature. She, however, continues to try to draw him back in by pretending to be benevolent and concerned. She asks him to teach one of her young teachers, Frances, who hopes to improve her skill in languages. William sees promising intelligence in this pupil and slowly begins to fall in love with her.

Jealous of the attention Frances is receiving from William, Mademoiselle Reuter takes it upon herself to dismiss Frances from her post and to hide her address from William. After a long search he re-encounters Frances in a graveyard and they renew their acquaintance.

It is revealed that as she was trying to make herself amiable in William&#x27;s eyes, Mademoiselle Reuter had accidentally fallen in love with him herself. Not wanting to cause a conflict with Monsieur Pelet, William leaves his establishment.

William gets a new position as a &quot;professor&quot; at a college, allowing him and Frances to marry. The two eventually open a school together and have a child. After achieving financial security the family travels around England and then settles in the countryside, near to Mr Hunsden. Frances gives birth to a child, Victor.

==Characters==

*William Crimsworth: The protagonist, an orphaned child who is educated at Eton College after being taken in by his uncles. Rejecting their offer of a post as a clergyman, as he does not believe himself good enough for the role, he severs ties with them in order to walk in his late father&#x27;s shoes and becomes a tradesman. His time in Yorkshire as a clerk for his cruel elder brother is short and he departs for Belgium, where he becomes a &quot;professor&quot; and meets his wife to be, who is a pupil of his. He is educated, religious and healthy, though not handsome.
*Lord Tynedale / Hon. John Seacombe: William&#x27;s maternal uncles who attempt to set William up as Rector of Seacombe-cum-Scaife and to marry him off to one of his own cousins, &quot;all of whom [he] greatly dislike[s]&quot;. William severs all ties with these relatives and little is related of them in the rest of the book.
*Charles: Seemingly William&#x27;s only friend at Eton. William writes a letter to him detailing his activities since Eton and just after his first meeting with Edward at Crimsworth Hall. This letter serves as an introduction to the book. Charles does not reply to the letter, as he has already set off for one of the colonies. He is an unseen character.
*Edward Crimsworth: William&#x27;s tyrannical elder brother. He is an accomplished tradesman, owner of a Yorkshire mill, married and more handsome than his brother. Jealous of his sibling&#x27;s education, he treats William cruelly. He later loses his wealth and wife, only to become rich again by the end of the book.
*Hunsden Yorke Hunsden: The man who frees William from his brother&#x27;s clutches. He sets him up with contacts in Brussels and the two become good friends. He is a unique but not unattractive man whose taste in women is similar to William&#x27;s, though he remains a lifelong bachelor.
*Monsieur Francois Pelet: The French headmaster of a boys&#x27; school in Belgium who employs William and becomes a good friend. He later betrays him to ensure the affection of Zoraïde Reuter, whom he later marries.
*Mademoiselle Zoraïde Reuter: The Catholic headmistress of the school in Belgium. William is initially attracted to her, though she is destined to marry Monsieur Pelet.
*Frances Evans Henri: A pupil-teacher at the school in Belgium where William Crimsworth finds himself. After the two fall in love they get married. They eventually move to England. She is a Swiss orphan of half -English extraction who was raised by her aunt.
*Madame Reuter: Zoraïde&#x27;s mother
*Madame Pelet: Monsieur Pelet&#x27;s mother
*Eulalie, Hortense and Caroline: Three coquettish students at Mademoiselle Reuter&#x27;s school
*Sylvie: Another student
*Jules Vanderkelkov: A student at Monsieur Pelet&#x27;s school
*Victor Crimsworth: Son of William and Frances Evans Henri.

==Themes==

===Religion===
Throughout the novel William looks down on Catholics and &quot;Romish wizardcraft&quot;. Charlotte Brontë pictures the two main Catholic characters as treacherous and untrustworthy. William believes that Catholic training has a negative influence on the young girls at his school.

William has a certain snobbery against the Flemish and is disgusted by the way they butcher the English language as he attempts to teach them.

==Context==
The novel is based on Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s experiences in Brussels, where she studied as a language student and was a teacher in 1842. Much of the subject matter of &quot;The Professor&quot; was later reworked, from the perspective of a female teacher, into Brontë&#x27;s later novel &quot;Villette&quot;.

==Early career==
Stirratt grew up in Mandeville, Louisiana. He attended Mandeville High School and the University of Mississippi, and is a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity.

He played regularly around the American South with The Hilltops, a band based in Oxford, Mississippi which included his twin sister Laurie Stirratt and her husband Cary Hudson. During that time he met and befriended the band Uncle Tupelo supporting them on tours of the East and Midwest.

<text>Bruce King (April 6, 1924 – November 13, 2009) was an American businessman and politician who for three non-consecutive four-year terms was the governor of New Mexico. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the longest-serving governor in New Mexico history, with 12 years of service.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
King was born on April 6, 1924, in Stanley, New Mexico. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II. After the war, he attended the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

King&#x27;s career in politics began when he was elected to the Santa Fe Board of County Commissioners in 1954. He was re-elected and served as the chairman of the board during his second term.

In 1959, he was elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives. He served five consecutive terms in the House and during three of his terms he was Speaker of the House. From 1968 to 1969, King was chairman of the state Democratic Party. In 1969, he was also the president of the State Constitutional Convention.

==Governor of New Mexico==
In 1970, King was elected governor, defeating Republican Pete Domenici. He served as the 23rd, 25th and 28th Governor of New Mexico from 1971 until 1975, 1979 until 1983 and from 1991 until 1995. His terms were non-consecutive because the New Mexico constitution did not allow governors to succeed themselves before 1991, due to term limits.

King became the first governor who could succeed himself after the term limit laws were changed and ran for reelection in 1994, but was defeated for a fourth term by Republican businessman Gary Johnson.

After the Church Rock uranium mill spill of 1979, King refused the Navajo Nation&#x27;s request that the site be declared a federal disaster area, limiting aid to affected residents. The spill was the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history, having released more radioactivity than the Three Mile Island accident four months earlier.

==Personal life==

King was married to his wife Alice for 61 years until her death on December 7, 2008. Their son Gary King served as New Mexico Attorney General from 2007 to 2015 and was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2014.

King was recovering from a procedure in September 2009 to adjust the pacemaker that was implanted after he had a heart attack in 1997. He died on November 13, 2009, in Stanley, New Mexico, at the age of 85.

<text>Wadi Allaqi, () also transliterated as Wadi Allaqui or Wadi Alalaqi, is a wadi (dry river) in southern Egypt. It begins in Sudan below the Halaib Triangle, and its mouth is south of Aswan on the eastern shore of Lake Nasser.

Wadi Allaqi is the major dry river in the southeastern part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt, draining the area from the hills near the Red Sea to the valley of the Nile. With a length of , the wadi is used by the nomadic Bejas who live in the area – about 1,000 members of the Ababda and Bisharyn tribes as of 2003 – to graze livestock, for the production of charcoal for fuel, to collect medicinal plants, for quarrying for copper and nickel and for agriculture on a small scale. As of 1989 the area has been a nature reserve managed by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency. It was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1993.

Wadi Allaqi is famous for gold and rock inscriptions. A noteworthy rock inscription site is found at Umm Ashira. A Middle Kingdom of Egypt fortress was built at Quban, near the original wadi&#x27;s mouth, with another fortress built at Ikkur. A stela attributed to New Kingdom of Egypt Ramesses II discovered near Quban references the search and discovery of water for gold laborers. That well is located 60 km into Wadi Allaqi, near Umm Ashira, and past the now flooded portion of the wadi now constituting Lake Nasser.

Gold deposits and mining are noteworthy in the upper parts of Wadi Allaqi, particularly at Hairiri, Heimur, Umm Garaiyat, Marahig, Seiga, Shoshoba, and Abu Fas. Gold and emeralds were extracted by chattel slaves between the 9th and 13th centuries. Gold mining in the Early Arab Period intensified under the rule of Ahmad ibn Tulun. Of note are two forts built during this period at Derahib.

<doc id="1194982" wikidata="Q146076" url="?curid=1194982" title="Zenata">
<text>The Zenata (; ) are a group of Berber tribes, historically one of the largest Berber confederations along with the Sanhaja and Masmuda. Their lifestyle was either nomadic or semi-nomadic.

==Society==
The 14th-century historiographer Ibn Khaldun reports that the Zenata were divided into three large tribes: Jarawa, Maghrawa, and Banu Ifran. Formerly occupying a large portion of the Maghreb, they were displaced to the south and west in conflicts with the more powerful Kutama and Houara.

The Zenata adopted Islam early, in the 7th century. While other Berber tribes continued to resist the Umayyad Caliphate conquest well into the 8th century, they were quickly Islamized. They also formed a substantial contingent in the subsequent Muslim conquest of Iberia.

== Language ==
As Berbers, the Zenata spoke one of the Berber languages. Ibn Khaldun wrote that their dialect was distinct from other Berber dialects. French linguist Edmond Destaing in 1915 proposed &quot;Zenati&quot; as a loose subgrouping within the Northern Berber languages, including Riffian Berber in northeastern Morocco and Shawiya Berber in northeastern Algeria.

==Political history==
Before the Arab conquests, the Zenata ranged between present-day Tunisia and Tripolitania in present-day Libya, before moving steadily west where they settled in western Algeria near Tiaret and Tlemcen, while some of them moved still further west to Morocco. They dominated the politics of the western Maghreb (Morocco and western Algeria) in two different periods: in the 10th century, during the decline of the Idrisids, as proxies for either the Fatimid Caliphs or the Umayyad Caliphs of Cordoba, and in the 13th to 16th centuries with the rise of the Zayyanid dynasty in Algeria and the Marinids and Wattasids in Morocco, all from Zenata tribes. Today, most of the Berbers of the Rif region are believed to be of Zenata ancestry.

=== 8th–11th centuries ===

In the early Islamic period of Morocco, Berber groups and tribes dominated the politics of the region well after the Arab conquests. The Zenata confederation did too. A Zenata chieftain, Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati, was a leading figure in the Berber revolt of 740 against the Arab Umayyad Caliphate, and led Berber rebels to major victories in the Battle of the Nobles and the Battle of Bagdoura. While the Umayyads managed to defeat the rebels eventually and reassert some of their authority, the westernmost parts of the Maghreb, including what is now Morocco, remained outside of Arab caliphal rule. In this vacuum, various principalities arose in the region, such as the Midrarid Emirate in eastern Morocco, led by a Zenata Miknasa tribe, to which the foundation of the city of Sijilmasa is attributed.

In 868, under the leadership of the Abd al-Razzaq, the Berber Khariji Sufri tribes of Madyuna, Ghayata and Miknasa formed a common front against the Idrisids of Fez. From their base in Sefrou they were able to defeat Ali ibn Umar and occupy Fez. The city&#x27;s inhabitants refused to submit, however, and the Idrisid Yahya III was able to retake the city. Starting in the early 10th century, however, the Fatimids in the east began to intervene in present-day Morocco, hoping to expand their influence, and used the Miknasa as proxies and allies in the region. In 917 the Miknasa and its leader Masala ibn Habus, acting on behalf of their Fatimid allies, attacked Fez and forced Yahya IV to recognize Fatimid suzerainty, before deposing him in 919 or 921. He was succeeded by his cousin Musa ibn Abul &#x27;Afiya, who had already been given charge over the rest of the country. The Idrisid Hassan I al-Hajam managed to wrest control of Fez from 925 but in 927 Musa returned, captured Hassan and killed him, marking the last time the Idrisids held power in Fez. Thereafter Fez remained under Zenata control. The Miknasa pursued the Idrisids to the fortress of Hajar an-Nasr in northern Morocco, but soon afterwards civil war broke out among the Miknasa when Musa switched allegiance to the Umayyads of Cordoba in 931 in an attempt to gain more independence. The Fatimids sent Humayd ibn Yasal (or Hamid), the nephew of Masala ibn Habus, to confront Musa, defeating him in 933 and forcing him to fall back into line. Once the Fatimids were gone, however, Musa once again threw off their authority and recognized the Umayyad caliph. The Fatimids sent their general Maysur to confront him again, and this time he fled. He was pursued and killed by the Idrisids. The latter preserved a part of their realm in northern Morocco until the Umayyads finally ended their rule definitively in 985. The Umayyads in turn kept control over northern Morocco until their caliphate&#x27;s collapse in the early 11th century. Following this, Morocco was dominated by various Zenata Berber tribes. Until the rise of the Sanhaja Almoravids later in the century, the Maghrawa controlled Fez, Sijilmasa and Aghmat while the Banu Ifran ruled over Tlemcen, Salé (Chellah), and the Tadla region.

=== 13th–16th centuries ===

In the 13th century the Banu Marin (), a Zenata tribe, rose to power in Morocco. Starting in 1245 they began overthrowing the Almohads who had controlled the region. At the height of their power in the mid-14th century, during the reigns of Abu al-Hasan and his son Abu Inan, the Marinid dynasty briefly held sway over most of the Maghreb including large parts of modern-day Algeria and Tunisia. They supported the Emirate of Granada in al-Andalus in the 13th and 14th centuries; an attempt to gain a direct foothold on the European side of the Strait of Gibraltar was however defeated at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340 and finished after the Castilians took Algeciras from the Marinids in 1344, definitively expelling them from the Iberian Peninsula. In contrast to their predecessors, the Marinids sponsored Maliki Sunnism as the official religion and made Fez their capital. Under their rule, Fez enjoyed a relative golden age. The Marinids also pioneered the construction of madrasas across the country which promoted the education of Maliki &quot;ulama&quot;, although Sufi sheikhs increasingly predominated in the countryside.

Starting in the early 15th century the Wattasid dynasty, a related ruling house, competed with the Marinid dynasty for control of their state and became &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Morocco between 1420 and 1459 while officially acting as regents or viziers. In 1465 the last Marinid sultan, Abd al-Haqq II, was finally overthrown and killed by a revolt in Fez, which led to the establishment of direct Wattasid rule over most of Morocco. The Wattasid sultans in turn lasted until the mid-16th century, when they were finally overthrown by the Saadians, who inaugurated the beginning of Arab Sharifian rule over Morocco (which continues under the present-day Alaouite dynasty).

Meanwhile, around the same time as the Marinids, the Zenata Zayyanid dynasty (also known as the Abd al-Wadids) ruled over the Kingdom of Tlemcen in northwestern Algeria, centered on Tlemcen. The territory stretched from Tlemcen to the Chelif bend and Algiers. At its zenith, the kingdom reached the Moulouya river to the west, Sijilmasa to the south, and the Soummam river to the east. The Zayyanid dynasty&#x27;s rule lasted from 1235 until 1556, when their rule, under pressure from the Spanish in Oran and the Saadians in Morocco, was finally ended by the Ottomans.

Zanata tribesmen also played a role as light cavalry in the armies of the Emirate of Granada. This gave rise to the Spanish term &quot;jinete&quot; (derived from the name &#x27;Zenata&#x27;), which denoted this type of light cavalry. They formed the backbone of the Granadan army, serving both in crucial battles as well as in regular raids inside Christian territory. They were highly mobile on the field, armed with lances, javelins, and small round shields known for their flexibility, and used their own characteristic set of tactics. They were recruited and led by exiled members of the Marinid family and settled within the kingdom of Granada. Their Marinid commander was known as the &quot;shaykh al-ghuzāt&quot; (&#x27;chief of the &quot;ghazis&quot;&#x27;), but in 1374 Muhammad V suppressed this office due to their political interference, after which they were commanded by a Nasrid or Andalusi general. They also served as mercenaries in the armies of Christian kingdoms such as Castile or as auxiliaries sent by the Nasrid emirs of Granada to aid their Castilian allies.

<doc id="1194986" wikidata="Q1120856" url="?curid=1194986" title="Fialka">
<text>In cryptography, Fialka (M-125) is the name of a Cold War-era Soviet cipher machine. A rotor machine, the device uses 10 rotors, each with 30 contacts along with mechanical pins to control stepping. It also makes use of a punched card mechanism. &quot;Fialka&quot; means &quot;violet&quot; in Russian. Information regarding the machine was quite scarce until c. 2005 because the device had been kept secret.

Fialka contains a five-level paper tape reader on the right hand side at the front of the machine, and a paper tape punch and tape printing mechanism on top. The punched-card input for keying the machine is located on the left hand side. The Fialka requires 24 volt DC power and comes with a separate power supply that accepts power at 100 to 250 VAC, 50–400 Hz by means of an external selector switch.

The machine&#x27;s rotors are labelled with Cyrillic, requiring 30 points on the rotors; this is in contrast to many comparable Western machines with 26-contact rotors, corresponding to the Latin alphabet. The keyboard, at least in the examples of East German origin, had both Cyrillic and Latin markings. There are at least two versions known to exist, the M-125-MN and the M-125-3MN. The M-125-MN had a typewheel that could handle Latin and Cyrillic letters. The M-125-3MN had separate typewheels for Latin and Cyrillic. The M-125-3MN had three modes, single shift letters, double shift with letters and symbols, and digits only, for use with code books and to superencrypt numeric ciphers.

==Encryption mechanism==
The Fialka rotor assembly has 10 rotors mounted on an axle and a 30 by 30 commutator (Kc 30x30). The commutator consists of two sets of 30 contact strips set at right angles to each other. A punched card is placed between the two sets of contacts via a door on the left hand side of the unit. Each punched card has 30 holes, with exactly one hole per row and column pair, and thereby specifies a permutation of the 30 rotor contact lines. This feature is comparable to the plug board on the Enigma machine, but is much stronger as it offers full permutation of the contacts as opposed to the pairwise swapping of letters on the Enigma. A triangular plate was used to enter the null permutation for testing purposes.

There are two types of rotors:
*disassemblable (&quot;zerlegbar&quot;) rotors, used with the M-125-3MN. The rotorset name is &quot;PROTON.&quot; The disassemblable rotors consist of an insert with electrical contacts and scramble wiring, and an outer ring with mechanical pins whose presence or absence control rotor stepping. As part of the key setup, the stepping control pins can be rotated relative to the outer ring. The inner, electrical ring can also be rotated relative to the outer ring and can be inserted in one of two ways, with side 1 or side 2 up.
*unitary rotors, used with the M-125-MN. These have both electrical contacts and mechanical pins. The only key adjustment is the order of the rotors on the axle and the initial rotor settings. There is one combination for the disassemblable rotors that is compatible with the unitary rotor. One East German manual that has become public contains typed-in and hand written addenda that suggest the East Germans, at least, later stopped using the added features of the disassemblable rotors and only used them in unitary compatibility mode.

Adjacent rotors step in opposite directions. A spare rotor assembly could be kept in the unit&#x27;s top cover. The Fialka machines were originally delivered with two sets of rotors, one with black lettering in the machine assemblage, and one set with red lettering supplied in a metal cylinder inside the dustcover.
The singly most crucial flaw in the Enigma design was that letter substitutions were reciprocal and that in particular a letter could never encrypt to itself. The Russians clearly learned from this in designing Fialka such that it is possible for a letter to encrypt to itself. Other weaknesses of Enigma, such as the regular stepping of the wheels and limited effect of the plugboard were also improved on Fialka.

==Keying material==
The keying material for the Fialka consists of a daily key book, a message key book and a message identifier book for broadcast traffic. The daily key book contains day keys for one month. A day key consists of a key table (in Cyrillic) and a punched card. For fixed rotor systems, the key table specifies the order of the rotors on the axle and the initial rotor settings to be used to decrypt the indicator of broadcast messages. As its name implies, the day key is valid (has a cryptoperiod in NSA parlance) for 24 hours and was changed at 00:01 hours. For the disassemblable rotors, the table also specifies the electrical insert for each outer rotor, which side was to be up, and the orientation of the insert relative to the outer rotor. Here is a sample M-125-3NM day key table for use on the 14th of the month:

:codice_1
:codice_2
:codice_3
:codice_4
:codice_5

The message key table contained the initial rotor settings to be used with each message. A message key was never to be used more than once. The keying material was distributed in a foil-covered package, with the daily key tables and punched cards fan-folded in a pouch with perforations between each item. The other tables were in a side pouch.

==Design measures against information leakage==
Design factors in various cryptographic devices can result in the physical leakage of information that may compromise the security of the system to varying degrees. This is commonly known as side-channel leakage or TEMPEST. The following describe appropriate counter measures that were taken in the design of Fialka.

===Power supply unit===
Fialka draws differing amounts of current depending on which (5-bit) encoded letter is printed or paper punched. If the power supply was plugged into the mains there would be an opportunity for the small power fluctuations to be observed by an eavesdropper.

In order to mask any mains supplied power fluctuations a data cable fed back from the Fialka machine to the power supply unit (PSU) indicating which letter was being output allowing the supply to compensate for the differing loads. The PSU was designed with a compensating circuit with five artificial load resistors which would be powered depending on the signal from the feedback cable. In addition to this, the PSU injects a strong noise signal into the power line, to further mask any remaining glitches or transient effects which could compromise the cipher.

==Comparison with other rotor machines==
The Fialka design is derived from contemporary rotor-based cipher machines, such as Enigma, the Swiss NEMA and the American KL-7. NEMA only had 5 electrical rotors vis-à-vis the Fialka&#x27;s 10, and furthermore NEMA lacked a punched card commutator or equivalent such as a plug board. Fialka is most comparable to the U.S. KL-7 which has eight electrical rotors and also lacks a commutator, but its keyboard permutation switch eliminated the need for a reflector (which had proven to be a weakness in the Enigma system).

<text>The 1978 New Brunswick general election was held on October 23, 1978, to elect 58 members to the 49th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, the governing house of the province of New Brunswick, Canada. Richard Hatfield&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party narrowly won its third term.

The result was the closest in New Brunswick history: the governing PCs won 30 seats to 28 for the opposition. The popular vote was very close: 146,719 votes were cast for Conservative candidates, and 146,596 for Liberals. In order to secure a workable majority following the election, Hatfield appointed Liberal Robert McCready as speaker of the legislature, despite strong objections from McCready&#x27;s Liberal colleagues; McCready went on to seek re-election as a Conservative and served in Hatfield&#x27;s cabinet.

The Parti Acadien had its best ever showing in the election, winning 12% of the vote in the ridings where it fielded candidates, and coming within 200 votes of electing Armand Plourde in Restigouche West.

==Background==
In the lead up to 1978, the Opposition Liberal Party seemed destined to return to power. A number of scandals had been tied to the Conservatives and Liberal leader Robert Higgins was widely popular. In early 1978, Higgins believed he had tied some of the scandals directly to Hatfield himself. In a bold move, Higgins promised to resign should Hatfield prove that he was not tied directly to the scandal, which Hatfield promptly did. Higgins was forced to abruptly resign and was replaced by Joseph Daigle as leader. The Liberals mused that Hatfield had purposely ensured false information was leaked to the Liberals to lead them into making false accusations.

Higgins&#x27; resignation created Hatfield&#x27;s best chance to go to the polls. He called an election shortly after Daigle became Liberal leader. Despite the lack of a direct link to Hatfield, scandal remained tied to his government and a close election result was assured.

==Campaign==
Hatfield&#x27;s government was not entirely clean. The Liberals pointed to the Conservatives&#x27; budgets, which no longer maintained a surplus. The Bricklin failure was also fresh on voters&#x27; minds. While campaigning in anglophone sections of the province, Hatfield accused Daigle of being an anti-monarchist for supporting Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s constitutional reforms.

<text>The Nashville and Eastern Railroad is a shortline railroad which administers of track between Nashville and Monterey, Tennessee, of which are currently operational. The company is based in Lebanon, Tennessee.

The Nashville and Eastern was formed in the 1980s to reestablish freight service from Nashville to Lebanon and points east. The railroad currently extends to Monterey, where it serves a large sand mining operation. The railroad provides freight shipping services to more than 30 companies. It also runs occasional passenger excursion trains from Nashville to Cookeville or Watertown in cooperation with the Tennessee Central Railway Museum in Nashville. The tracks that it operates were originally operated by the Tennessee Central Railway, which went out of business in 1968.

The railroad is the home of the WeGo Star commuter rail service between Nashville and Lebanon. Service began on September 18, 2006. The service is operated by the Regional Transportation Authority, Nashville&#x27;s public transportation agency.

NERR has a subsidiary, the Nashville &amp; Western Railroad Corp. , that operates between Nashville and Ashland City on the former western end of the Tennessee Central. 

On November 5, 2018, R.J. Corman Railroad Group announced that it had finalized an agreement to acquire both NERR and NWR as well as Transit Solution Group, operator of the WeGo Star commuter trains. Pending regulatory approval, R. J. Corman was expected to take over operations in January 2019.

<text>Prainha is a civil parish in the municipality of São Roque do Pico on the island of Pico, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. It has 530 inhabitants in an area of 26.10 km2.

==History==
“Prainha” was the second settlement to be formed on the north coast of Pico Island, whose settlement began with natives from Northern Portugal, after stopping at Terceira and Graciosa. According to Gaspar Frutuoso, in &quot;Saudades da Terra&quot;, this village already existed in 1522, as well as its parish church. The oldest known record of this temple dates from 1599, although the administrative and ecclesiastical institution of Prainha came much earlier. In 1572, an enormous volcanic eruption took place on a peak near the Caiado Lake, next to the parish. The extraordinary torrent of lava reached the sea and formed a great “mistério” (Azorean expression to designate a terrain of spongy lava, covered with moss and herbs), known as &quot;Prainha&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;little beach&quot;). This &quot;mistério&quot; located between this parish and São Roque is classified as a nature reserve.

For centuries, there were no other means of communication between the various islands of the archipelago, except by sea, until in 1858, the first telephone connection was made between Lisbon and Ponta Delgada, which also helped to connect other islands. The first connections on Pico were made in the parish of Prainha, specifically on the place of Canto da Areia, which was connected to São Jorge by a cable. The small house which served as a terminal for the submarine cable is still known today as &quot;Casa do Fio&quot; (House of the Wire), and was used as a shelter for a military detachment during World War I.

==Geography==

Prainha is located on the northern coast of the municipality of São Roque do Pico, buttressed by the parishes of Santo Amaro in the east, São Roque to the west, Lajes and Ribeiras to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the north. It has an almost perfect rectangular shape, with , which corresponds to 18.3% of the municipality&#x27;s total area, and is approximately from its seat.

The parish has very rough topography with slopes oriented NW-SE which connect the low, coastal plain lands with the high, inland Achada Plateau reaching on Cabeço do Mistério. The territory is part of the Volcanic Complex of São Roque-Piedade. The Mistério da Prainha, a formation made up of lava flows emitted by a historic eruption above the parish (1562-1564), occupies the extreme west of it. This latter area, extends from the coast to the interior, and is characterized by its high fajã and massive lava delta along the northern coast (equally divided between Prainha and São Roque). This zone also pertains to the Recreational Forest Reserve of Prainha.
The coastline, with about , is generally low and very jagged, with islets and points that alternate with sheltered coves, especially the Areia Bay (Baía da Areia) and the Canas Bay (Baía de Canas). The small port and above all the “natural pools” attract many holidaymakers, especially Poça Branca, where there are excellent conditions for bathing. The beach of Canto da Areia, with black volcanic sands, is the only beach on Pico Island. The small watercourses, with shallow valleys, originate in the Achada Plateau and flow in a torrential regime. South of the parish, numerous lagoons (Lagoa do Caiado, Lagoa Seca) are home to various bird and plant species and have a significant environmental interest.

===Climate===
Prainha has a humid subtropical climate, with some Mediterranean influences. The parish is located on an extremely precipitous area on the island of Pico and the Azores. Areas close to the coast receive on average around of precipitation per year, making it among the rainiest coastal areas on the middle latitudes. At higher altitudes, precipitation is even higher, with the Lagoa do Caiado receiving over per year. Temperatures experienced in the winter (January through March) hover between at daytime and at night and in the summer (July through September) temperatures vary from during the day and during the night. Humidity is around 80% year-round.

===Human geography===
In terms of human occupation, the pattern of settlement is linear, extending along the regional road. The main agglomerates are the places of Prainha de Cima, Prainha de Baixo and Canto da Areia. The secondary streets, which run perpendicular to the coastline, accommodate some scattered houses.

In the last century, the population evolved in a similar way to the other parishes of the archipelago, registering a decrease in the period from 1900 to 1930, a slight increase until 1960 and again a gradual decrease until today.

==Economy==
Farming, viticulture and fishing are the economic base of the parish, along with livestock, carpentry, sawmilling, baking, dairy products, small businesses and basalt cutting. More recently, tourism has also played a role in the local economy, several typical houses made of volcanic stone, characteristic of the island have been the focus of restoration works.

<text>Warszewiczia (or &quot;Warscewiczia&quot;) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. They are primarily tropical Central and South American trees and shrubs. Perhaps the most famous member of the genus is &quot;W. coccinea&quot; (chaconia), which is the national flower of Trinidad and Tobago.

==Description==
The inflorescences show leaf-shaped, bright-colored calycophylls, expanded foliaceous structures made from floral petaloids with enlarged showy calyx-lobes. Their main task is to attract pollinators.

==Taxonomy==
This genus was named after Józef Warszewicz, a 19th-century Polish orchid collector and inspector of the botanic gardens in Kraków, Poland. Warszawa is also the Polish name for Warsaw – capital city of Poland.

<text>Odilio González (born 5 March 1937), known by his stage name , is a Puerto Rican singer, guitarist and music composer who has been singing and composing for more than 65 years. He has mostly played traditional Puerto Rican folkloric music, songs dedicated to Puerto Rico&#x27;s .

==Career==
González was born in 1937 in Piletas barrio in Lares, a municipality of Puerto Rico. He used to sing at funerals in Lares then became a popular child star after a series of early radio performances in the capital city of San Juan.

González has sung in the island&#x27;s ancient traditional poetic song form, the &quot;décima&quot; (also known as &quot;jíbaro&quot; music), as well as performing mainstream pop music. His stage name is &quot;El Jibarito de Lares&quot;. He debuted on the New York City stage in 1958, singing before Puerto Ricans in the Teatro Puerto Rico. His first recordings of traditional &quot;jíbaro&quot;, available from Ansonia Records, were recorded in New York City during that period. Fellow Lares native José Feliciano&#x27;s singing style was influenced by González during his youth.

González crossed over into pop music in 1962, when he recorded &quot;Celos Sin Motivo&quot;, composed by Ismael Santiago. Another of his successful recordings was (&quot;I had a light&quot;), a Christmas song recorded in the early 1970s.

Gonzalez resides in Arecibo, Puerto Rico and continues to perform around the island as well as on trips to the United States to sing for older Puerto Rican expatriates, including a visit to Hawaii to sing before the Puerto Rican diaspora there.

<text>Gertrude Dunn (September 30, 1933September 29, 2004) was an American baseball player with the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the league made famous by the 1992 film &quot;A League Of Their Own&quot;.

== Career ==
Dunn played shortstop on two teams, the Battle Creek Belles and the South Bend Blue Sox, and was named &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; in 1952.

When the league was unable to continue in 1955, Dunn joined several other players selected by former Fort Wayne Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans All-Stars. The team played 100 games, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager&#x27;s station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Dunn, the Allington All-Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Betty Foss, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Magdalen Redman, Ruth Richard, Dorothy Schroeder, Jean Smith, Dolly Vanderlip and Joanne Weaver, among others.

She later attended West Chester University of Pennsylvania and graduated with the class of 1960.

Dunn was a player on the United States women&#x27;s national field hockey team. She also coached field hockey and was named to the USA Field Hockey Hall of Fame on January 16, 1988.

<text>is a Japanese video game developer based in Osaka, Japan, with an additional office in Tokyo. It is best known for developing games in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchises. The company was founded on March 6, 2000 by several former SNK and Capcom employees, including &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; co-creator Takashi Nishiyama and Hiroshi Matsumoto.

==History==
In 2000, Takashi Nishiyama resigned from SNK, and was soon approached with offers for employment by various Tokyo-based companies. At the same time, SNK&#x27;s core development team members left the company, assuming Nishiyama had plans. Nishiyama decided to form a new company in Osaka, named Sokiac, to avoid having to move his team members and their families. To better reflect its mission to create games for a variety of genres and platforms, the company later changed its name to Dimps, short for &quot;Digital Multi-Platforms&quot;. The company was supported by capital from Sammy, Bandai, Sony Computer Entertainment, and Sega.

<text>The NaviDrive system is a voice-activated radio, CD player, telephone, and navigation system (GPS) all in one unit, assembled in Citroën (Citroën C8, C6, C5, C4 and C3) and Peugeots vehicles. It includes a special function for reading back incoming text messages and dedicated buttons for dialling up the emergency or recovery services (to whom it can indicate the car position).
==Functions==
Its main functions and characteristics are:

- monochrome or 7&quot; color screen

- Complete GPS Navigation system

- Radio, CD player with MP3 and CD changer for 6 CDs

- Integrated GSM dual band handsfree telephone

- Text-to-speech (reading of SMS messages)

- Voice recognition (&quot;guide to John&quot;...)

- Real-time traffic information (RDS-TMC)
==Incident response==
In certain countries (France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg), in the case of an accident (by pressing a button or automatically when an airbag deploys), this system sends a text message containing the exact GPS position of the vehicle followed by a voice call to a special telephonic assistance platform which receives the position and the voice call. This platform determines the kind of urgency (medical, accident, fire...) by asking a few questions and sends the appropriate emergency services to the exact location of the vehicle.

<doc id="1195014" wikidata="Q3525867" url="?curid=1195014" title="Andrew Hall">
<text>Andrew James Hall (born 31 July 1975) is a former South African first-class cricketer who played from 1999 until 2011. He played as an all-rounder who bowled fast-medium pace and has been used as both an opening batsman and in the lower order. He was born in Johannesburg in South Africa in 1975 and educated at Hoërskool Alberton in Alberton, Gauteng.

Prior to making it on the South African first-class cricket scene he played indoor cricket for South Africa. He broke through in 1995/96 and has played for Transvaal, Gauteng, and Easterns.

Internationally, Hall was initially thought of solely as a limited overs cricket specialist and made his ODI debut against the West Indies at Durban in 1999. He was a regular in the ODI side until 2007, taking part in South Africa&#x27;s 2003 Cricket World Cup squad and the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He appeared in the Test side sporadically and made his debut in 2002 against Australia at Cape Town. Batting at number 8, he scored 70 but did not pick up any wickets in the match.

He retired from international cricket in September 2007 but continued to play domestic cricket in both South Africa and England until 2014.

==International career==
During the 2003 England tour he received a late call-up to the South African squad and impressed with 16 wickets in the Test series. He scored a match-winning 99 not out at Headingley and became the 5th batsman in Test cricket to have been stranded one short of a hundred.

In 2004, due to the absence of the recently retired Gary Kirsten and non-touring Herschelle Gibbs, he was promoted to open the batting in the Test series against India. He reacted to the added responsibility by scoring 163 at Kanpur - his maiden Test century. The century was made against the likes of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, batting for almost ten hours.

He holds the World Record 8th wicket stand in ODI cricket of 138 with Justin Kemp, made against India in November 2006. His contribution was an unbeaten 56 from 47 balls and he went on to take 3 wickets in the second innings.

During the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies he took his maiden 5 wicket haul (5/18) against England on 17 April at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados.

===International retirement===
Hall retired from international cricket in September 2007. Whilst not giving a reason for his decision, Graham Ford - Hall&#x27;s coach at Kent - speculated it was due to his omission from the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship squad, saying:

==County career==
Hall played for Durham Cricket Board in the 1999 NatWest Trophy, his first experience in English County Cricket. He played one List A match for Suffolk in the 2002 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy whilst playing for Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League. This was Halls only appearance in any form of cricket for Suffolk. He then played his first senior English cricket for Worcestershire in the 2003 and 2004 English seasons.

Hall moved to play for Kent from 2005 to 2007, playing parts of each season when not appearing for the South African side. He returned to England in 2008 when he signed for Northamptonshire as a Kolpak player. While playing for Northants he set a record for the side&#x27;s best Twenty20 bowling figures, taking 6/21 against Worcestershire in 2008. He also achieved his best Twenty20 batting performance in the same game (66 not out). He became captain of the county in 2010 after fellow South African Nicky Boje resigned, remaining captain until after the 2012 season when he was replaced by Stephen Peters. During his tenure as captain he nearly led Northants to promotion in the County Championship.

Hall continued to play for Northants until the end of the 2014 season when he was not offered a new contract. He announced his retirement from professional cricket shortly afterwards.

==Mugging incidents==

Hall was the victim of a robbery at an automatic teller machine in 1999 during which he was shot in his left hand. The mugger is said to have fired six shots at him. In 2002, he was driven around in his own car with a gun pointed to his head.

<text>Warszewiczia coccinea (or chaconia, wild poinsettia, pastora del monte and pride of Trinidad and Tobago) is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is the national flower of Trinidad and Tobago . It is also found throughout Central America and the West Indies southward to Bolivia.

This small, evergreen ornamental tree is remarkable for its inflorescence (a verticiliaster of up to a dozen clusters) with bright red bracts and inconspicuous yellow petals.

A cultivar, the double chaconia, which has a double row of bracts, is the more widely cultivated form. This plant originates from cuttings taken from a wild plant found growing along a roadside. Since propagation from seed has not yet been successful, all double chaconias have been propagated by cuttings from this individual.

The Warszewiczia coccinea&#x27;s habitat is lowland, forests and second growth. Its optimum altitude is 0 to 500 meters above sea level. It is rarely found in areas beyond 500 meters.

<text>Joseph Gibson Hoyt (January 19, 1815 – November 26, 1862) was the first chancellor and a professor of Greek at Washington University in St. Louis (then named Washington Institute in St. Louis) from 1858 to 1862. Born in Dunbarton, New Hampshire in 1815, Hoyt received his undergraduate education at Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. After Hoyt&#x27;s graduation from Yale in 1840, he served as an instructor in mathematics and natural philosophy at Phillips Exeter Academy from 1840 to 1858, before taking up his post at Washington University. In 1862, Hoyt died in St. Louis, Missouri at the age of 47.

<doc id="1195044" wikidata="Q3482353" url="?curid=1195044" title="Shirley Dysart">
<text>Shirley Theresa Dysart CM (&quot;née&quot; Britt, February 22, 1928 – December 14, 2016) was an American-born Canadian teacher and a politician in the province of New Brunswick.

She attained a number of &quot;firsts&quot; in New Brunswick politics. She was the first female Liberal in serve in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick, the first woman to serve as the leader of a party in the provincial Legislature (1985), the first woman to be Minister of Education (1987–1991) and first woman to be Speaker (1991–1995).

==Early years==
Shirley Theresa Britt was born into an Irish Catholic family in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928, the eldest of eight children born to Canadians Leslie John Britt and Mary Agnes (&quot;née&quot; Donovan) Britt. Her parents were both born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and in May 1927 they traveled to Waltham, Massachusetts to stay with a cousin. They returned to Canada when Shirley was still a baby, and she was followed by seven more children: Daniel, Raymond, Kenny, Shirley Joan, Anne, John and Gerald. She often cared for her younger siblings while her parents worked.

Shirley and her siblings, fifth-generation residents of Saint John, grew up in Saint John&#x27;s East Side in the Cathedral Parish, where they attended public schools and St. Vincent&#x27;s High School. Upon graduating she studied at the New Brunswick Teachers&#x27; College and the University of New Brunswick. She was awarded a Beaverbrook Scholarship and studied at the University of London.

==Career==
After graduating college, Dysart taught at her high school alma mater, St. Vincent&#x27;s High School in Saint John. In 1967 she became a member of the school board for District 20. She later served as chair of the board for three years, the first woman to hold the position.

In 1974 the leader of the Liberal Party, Bob Higgins, suggested she run for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick; she won the seat of Saint John North, becoming the first female Liberal, and second female of any party, to serve in the Legislative Assembly. In 1976, she served on the Bi-Centennial Celebration Committee for the Province of New Brunswick.

Dysart was re-elected in 1978, 1982, 1987 and 1991, holding her seat for twenty years. She remains the only Liberal politician to win five consecutive elections in Saint John.

In 1985, she was appointed the interim Leader of the Opposition, becoming the first woman to serve as the Leader of a political party in New Brunswick. Following the 1987 election, she was appointed Minister of Education, becoming the first woman to hold the position. While serving as Minister of Education, she led the introduction of a province-wide universal, full-day public kindergarten program, becoming known as the &quot;architect&quot; of the province&#x27;s kindergarten system. She was also responsible for a number of community projects in St. John, including the rebuilding of the Imperial Theatre.

In 1991, Dysart was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the first woman to hold the position. She retired from politics in 1995, not seeking re-election in the general election of that year.

In addition to her political career, Dysart held a number of community leadership positions. She was president of the Catholic Women&#x27;s League Council, president of the University of New Brunswick Alumni Council, and a member of the board of governors of the Beaverbrook Art Gallery. She served on the boards of the New Brunswick Music Festival, Theatre New Brunswick, the University of New Brunswick Alumni Council, Saint John Family Services, and the Irish-Canadian Cultural Association.

==Honors and awards==
In October 1996 Dysart was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of New Brunswick Saint John, and in 2000, she received a Red Cross Humanitarian Award. She was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 2004. In 2012 she was a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

In 2015 she was named a Champion of Public Education by the national educational charity The Learning Partnership. She was also the recipient of the Commemorative Medal for the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada, and the Paul Harris Fellowship from the Rotary Club of Saint John.

==Personal life==
Dysart was married to H. Eric Dysart and had one son, J. E. Britt Dysart.

Dysart died &quot;after a period of failing health&quot; on December 14, 2016, at the age of 88. She was survived by her son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren, as well as two sisters, two brothers, and a large extended family. Following her death, flags at Saint John City Hall were flown at half-staff as a sign of respect.

<doc id="1195048" wikidata="Q28253" url="?curid=1195048" title="Lane departure warning system">
<text>In road-transport terminology, a lane departure warning system (LDWS) is a mechanism designed to warn the driver when the vehicle begins to move out of its lane (unless a turn signal is on in that direction) on freeways and arterial roads. These systems are designed to minimize accidents by addressing the main causes of collisions: driver error, distractions and drowsiness. In 2009 the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began studying whether to mandate lane departure warning systems and frontal collision warning systems on automobiles.

There are four types of systems:
*Lane departure warning (LDW): Systems which warn the driver if the vehicle is leaving its lane with visual, audible, and/or vibration warnings
*[[Lane keeping assist]] (LKA/LKS): Systems which warn the driver and, with no response, automatically take steps to ensure the vehicle stays in its lane
*[[Lane departure warning system|Lane centering assist]] (LCA): Systems which assist in oversteering, keeping the car centered in the lane, and asking the driver to take over in challenging situations
*[[Automated lane keeping systems]] (ALKS): Designed to follow lane markings with no human driver.

Another system is the emergency lane keeping (ELK). The emergency lane keeping applies correction to a vehicle which drifts beyond a solid lane marking.

==Rationale and method==

One of the main causes of single vehicle crashes and frontal crashes is lane departure. The goal of the lateral support systems (LSS) is to help to avoid such crashes.

Without those LSS systems, lane departure can be unintentional; the car drifts towards and across the edge of the lane. The car then reach a potentially dangerous situation. This system does not work when the edge of the lane is not marked by a line.

A lane detection system used behind the lane departure warning system uses the principle of Hough transform and Canny edge detector to detect lane lines from realtime camera images fed from the front-end camera of the automobile. A basic flowchart of how a lane detection algorithm works to help lane departure warning is shown in the figures.

Lane warning/keeping systems are based on:
*Video sensors in the visual domain (mounted behind the windshield, typically integrated beside the rear mirror)
*Laser sensors (mounted on the front of the vehicle)
*Infrared sensors (mounted either behind the windshield or under the vehicle)

In Europe, the lane departure warning system should be compatible with a visible lane marking identification standard such as commission regulation EU-351/2012.

==History==
The concept and a working model of this technology was invented and fitted to a Rover SD1 in England by British inventor Nick Parish in 1988. Patent application No 8911571.1 was made in 1989.

The first production lane departure warning system in Europe was developed by the United States company Iteris for Mercedes Actros commercial trucks. The system debuted in 2000, and is now available on many new cars, SUVs, and trucks.

In 2002, the Iteris system became available on Freightliner Trucks&#x27; North American vehicles. In both these systems, the driver is warned of unintentional lane departures by an audible rumble strip sound generated on the side of the vehicle drifting out of the lane. No warnings are generated if, before crossing the lane, an active turn signal is given by the driver. 

=== 2001 ===
Nissan Motors began offering a lane-keeping support system on the Cima 450XV Limited (F500) sold in Japan.

=== 2002 ===
Toyota introduced its lane monitoring system on models such as the Caldina and Alphard sold in Japan; this system warns the driver if it appears the vehicle is beginning to drift out of its lane.

=== 2003 ===
Honda launched its Lane Keep Assist System (LKAS) on the Inspire. It provides up to 80% of steering torque to keep the car in its lane on the highway. It is also designed to make highway driving less cumbersome, by minimizing the driver&#x27;s steering input. A camera, mounted at the top of the windshield just above the rear-view mirror, scans the road ahead in a 40-degree radius, picking up the dotted white lines used to divide lane boundaries on the highway. The computer recognizes that the driver is &quot;locked into&quot; a particular lane, monitors how sharp a curve is, and uses factors such as yaw and vehicle speed to calculate the steering input required.

=== 2004 ===
In 2004, the first passenger-vehicle system available in North America was jointly developed by Iteris and Valeo for Nissan on the Infiniti FX and (in 2005) the M vehicles. In this system, a camera (mounted in the overhead console above the mirror) monitors the lane markings on a roadway. A warning tone is triggered to alert the driver when the vehicle begins to drift over the markings. Also in 2004, Toyota added a lane keeping assist feature to the Crown Majesta which can apply a small counter-steering force to aid in keeping the vehicle in its lane.

=== 2005 ===
Citroën became the first in Europe to offer LDWS on its 2005 C4 and C5 models, and its C6. This system uses infrared sensors to monitor lane markings on the road surface, and a vibration mechanism in the seat alerts the driver of deviations.

=== 2006 ===
Lexus introduced a multi-mode lane keeping assist system on the LS 460, which utilizes stereo cameras and more sophisticated object- and pattern-recognition processors. This system can issue an audiovisual warning and also (using the electric power steering or EPS) steer the vehicle to hold its lane. It also applies counter-steering torque to help ensure the driver does not over-correct or &quot;saw&quot; the steering wheel while attempting to return the vehicle to its proper lane. If the radar cruise control system is engaged, the Lane Keep function works to help reduce the driver&#x27;s steering-input burden by providing steering torque; however, the driver must remain active or the system will deactivate.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Audi began offering its Audi lane assist feature for the first time on the Q7. This system, unlike the Japanese &quot;assist&quot; systems, will not intervene in actual driving; rather, it will vibrate the steering wheel if the vehicle appears to be exiting its lane. The LDW System in Audi is based on a forward-looking video-camera in its visible range, instead of the downward-looking infrared sensors in the Citroën. Also in 2007, Infiniti offered a newer version of its 2004 system, which it called the Lane Departure Prevention (LDP) system. This feature utilizes the vehicle stability control system to help assist the driver maintain lane position by applying gentle brake pressure on the appropriate wheels.

=== 2008 ===
General Motors introduced Lane Departure Warning on its 2008 model-year Cadillac STS, DTS, and Buick Lucerne models. The General Motors system warns the driver with an audible tone and a warning indicator on the dashboard. BMW also introduced Lane Departure Warning on the 5 Series (E60) and 6 Series, using a vibrating steering wheel to warn the driver of unintended departures. In late 2013 BMW updated the system with Traffic Jam Assistant appearing first on the redesigned BMW X5, this system works below . Volvo introduced the lane departure warning system and the driver alert control on its 2008 model-year S80, the V70, and XC70 executive cars. Volvo&#x27;s lane departure warning system uses a camera to track road markings and sound an alarm when drivers depart their lane without signaling. The systems used by BMW, Volvo, and General Motors are based on core technology from Mobileye.

=== 2009 ===
Mercedes-Benz began offering a Lane Keeping Assist function on the new E-class. This system warns the driver (with a steering-wheel vibration) if it appears the vehicle is beginning to leave its lane. Another feature will automatically deactivate and reactivate if it ascertains the driver is intentionally leaving his lane (for instance, aggressively cornering). A newer version will use the braking system to assist in maintaining the vehicle&#x27;s lane.

=== 2010 ===
Kia Motors offered the 2011 Cadenza premium sedan with an optional lane departure warning system (LDWS) in limited markets. This system uses a flashing dashboard icon and emits an audible warning when a white lane marking is being crossed, and emits a louder audible warning when a yellow-line marking is crossed. This system is canceled when a turn signal is operating, or by pressing a deactivation switch on the dashboard; it works by using an optical sensor on both sides of the car.

=== 2011 ===
Audi A7 introduces Audi active lane assist.

=== 2012 ===
Mobileye developed a system that detected lane markings, and identified when a vehicle departed from its driving lane without the use of the turn signal.

=== 2013 ===
Mercedes began Distronic Plus with Steering Assist and Stop&amp;Go Pilot on the redesigned S-class in 2013.

=== 2014 ===
Tesla Model S comes with advanced lane assistance systems with their 2014 release. It was also released with a speed assist feature where the front facing camera reads the traffic speed limits using the technology of computer vision character recognition system, and then conveys it to the car. On roads where traffic signs are absent, it relies on the GPS data. When the car moves away from a lane at above , the system beeps and the steering wheel vibrate, alerting the driver of an unintended lane change. This happens during speed limit non-compliance as well.

Fiat is launching its lane keep assist feature based on TRW&#x27;s lane keeping assist system (also known as the haptic lane feedback system). This system integrates the lane-detection camera with TRW&#x27;s electric power-steering system; when an unintended lane departure is detected (the turn signal is not engaged to indicate the driver&#x27;s desire to change lanes), the electric power-steering system will introduce a gentle torque that will help guide the driver back toward the center of the lane. Introduced on the Lancia Delta in 2008, this system earned the Italian Automotive Technical Association&#x27;s Best Automotive Innovation of the Year Award for 2008. Peugeot introduced the same system as Citroën in its new 308.

Lane departure warning systems combine prevention with risk reports in the transportation industry. Viewnyx applies video-based technology to assist fleets in lowering their driving liability costs. By providing safety managers with driver- and fleet-risk assessment reports and tools, it facilitates proactive coaching and training to eliminate high-risk behaviors. The Lookout Solution is used by North American fleets, and there is research on implementing a lane departure warning system via a mobile phone.

=== 2017 ===
An Insurance Institute for Highway Safety raised concern that drivers may be less vigilant when relying on automated safety systems or become distracted by dashboard displays that monitor how the systems are performing.

Two separate studies found that lane-keeping systems and blind spot monitoring systems had lower crash rates than the same vehicles without the systems. Police crash data from 25 states between 2009 and 2015 for vehicle models where the systems were sold as optional reduced rates of single-vehicle, sideswipe, and head-on crashes by 11 percent, and injuries in such crashes by 21 percent. The sample size was not large enough to control for demographic and other variables.

== Lane keeping and next technologies ==

Lane keeping assist (LKA) is a feature that, in addition to the lane departure warning system, automatically takes steps to ensure the vehicle stays in its lane. Some vehicles combine adaptive cruise control with lane keeping systems to provide additional safety.

While the combination of these features creates a semi-autonomous vehicle, most require the driver to remain in control of the vehicle while it is in use. This is because of the limitations associated with the lane-keeping feature.

The lane keeping assist system is being achieved in modern vehicle systems using image processing techniques called Hough transform and Canny edge detection techniques. These advanced image processing techniques derive lane data from forward facing cameras attached to the front of the vehicle. Real-time image processing using powerful computers like Nvidia&#x27;s Drive PX1 are being used by many vehicle OEMs to achieve fully autonomous vehicles in which lane detection algorithm plays a key part. Advanced lane detection algorithms are also being developed using deep learning and neural network techniques. Nvidia has achieved high accuracy in developing self-driving features including lane keeping using the neural network based training mechanism in which they use a front facing camera in a car and run it through a route and then uses the steering input and camera images of the road fed into the neural network and make it &#x27;learn&#x27;. The neural network then will be able to change the steering angle based on the lane change on the road and keep the car in the middle of the lane.

A lane keeping assist mechanism can either reactively turn a vehicle back into the lane if it starts to leave or proactively keep the vehicle in the center of the lane. Vehicle companies often use the term &quot;lane keep(ing) assist&quot; to refer to both reactive lane keep assist (LKA) and proactive lane centering assist (LCA) but the terms are beginning to be differentiated.

In 2020, UNECE released an automated lane keeping system (ALKS) regulation which include features such as lane-keeping and adaptative speed for specific roads up to 60 km/h.

===Vehicles===
Requires driver control while vehicle is in use, but adjusts steering if vehicle detects itself drifting out of lane ((LKA) refers to reactive &quot;lane keep(ing) assist&quot; and (LCA) refers to proactive lane centering):

List shows up to 2015 model year. This feature has become more widespread since then, as seen below.

Allows unassisted driving under limited conditions
==Prevalence==
Lane keeping assist is mandatory for new cars and vans in the European Union as of 2022 under the name Emergency Lane Keeping System.

==Limitations==
Lane departure warning systems and lane keeping systems rely on visible lane markings. They typically cannot decipher faded, missing, or incorrect lane markings. Markings covered in snow or old lane markings left visible can hinder the ability of the system.

UNECE regulation 130 does not require LDWS of heavy vehicles to work under 60 km/h or to work in a curve with a radius lower than 250 meters.

Lane departure warning systems also face many legal limitations regarding autonomous driving. As stated previously, this system requires constant driver input. Vehicles with this technology are limited to assisting the driver, not driving the vehicle. Lane departure warning systems biggest limitation is that it is not in complete control of the vehicle. The system does not take into account other vehicles on the road and &quot;cannot replace good driving habits&quot;.

==Potential danger==
American Automobile Association testers found advanced driver assistance systems inconsistent and dangerous. Systems performed &#x27;mostly as expected&#x27;, but when approaching a simulated disabled vehicle a collision occurred 66 per cent of the time and the average impact speed was 25 mph (40kmh).

<doc id="1195051" wikidata="Q1168267" url="?curid=1195051" title="The House of the Spirits">
<text>The House of the Spirits (, 1982) is the debut novel of Isabel Allende. The novel was rejected by several Spanish-language publishers before being published in Barcelona in 1982. It became an instant best-seller, was critically acclaimed, and catapulted Allende to literary stardom. The novel was named Best Novel of the Year in Chile in 1982, and Allende received the country&#x27;s &quot;Panorama Literario&quot; award. &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; has been translated into over 20 languages.

The book was first conceived by Allende when she received news that her 100-year-old grandfather was dying. She began to write him a letter that ultimately became the manuscript of &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;. Her novel is influenced by Gabriel García Márquez’s novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;.

The story details the life of the Trueba family, spanning four generations, and tracing the post-colonial social and political upheavals of Chile – though the country&#x27;s name and the names of figures closely paralleling historical ones, such as &quot;the Candidate/President&quot; (Salvador Allende) or &quot;the Poet&quot; (Pablo Neruda), are never explicitly given. The story is told mainly from the perspective of two protagonists (Esteban and Alba) and incorporates elements of magical realism.

==Plot summary==
The story starts with the del Valle family, focusing upon the youngest and the eldest daughters of the family, Clara and Rosa. The youngest daughter, Clara del Valle, has paranormal powers and keeps a detailed diary of her life. Using her powers, Clara predicts that an accidental death will occur in the family. Shortly after this, Clara&#x27;s sister, Rosa the Beautiful, is killed by poison intended for her father who is running for the Senate. Clara is shocked into muteness after witnessing the autopsy performed on her sister&#x27;s body. Rosa&#x27;s fiancé, a poor miner named Esteban Trueba, is devastated and attempts to mend his broken heart by devoting his life to restoring his family hacienda, Las Tres Marías, which has fallen into poverty and disrepair. He sends money to his spinster sister who takes care of their arthritic mother in town. Through a combination of intimidation and reward, he enforces respect and labor from the fearful peasants and turns Tres Marías into a &quot;model hacienda&quot;. He turns the first peasant who spoke to him upon arrival, Pedro Segundo, into his foreman, who quickly becomes the closest thing that Trueba ever has to an actual friend during his life. He rapes many of the peasant women and children, and his first victim, then 15 year old Pancha García, becomes the mother of his bastard son, Esteban García. Throughout the novel, he visits Transito Soto, a prostitute. With Esteban&#x27;s help, she becomes a wildly successful brothel madam in the city and always is willing to repay the favor to him. 

Esteban returns to the city to see his dying mother. After her death, Esteban decides to fulfill her dying wish for him to marry and have legitimate children. He goes to the Del Valle family to ask for Clara&#x27;s hand in marriage. Clara accepts Esteban&#x27;s proposal; she herself has predicted her engagement two months prior, speaking for the first time in nine years. During the period of their engagement, Esteban builds what everyone calls &quot;the big house on the corner,&quot; a large mansion in the city where the Trueba family will live for generations. After their wedding, Esteban&#x27;s sister Férula comes to live with the newlyweds in the big house on the corner. Férula develops a strong dedication to Clara, which fulfills her need to serve others. However, Esteban&#x27;s wild desire to possess Clara and to monopolize her love causes him to throw Férula out of the house. She curses him, telling him that he will shrink in body and soul, and die like a dog. Although she misses her sister-in-law, Clara is unable to find her by any means - the gap between her and her husband widens as she devotes more time to her daughter and the mystic arts.

Clara gives birth to a daughter named Blanca and later, to twin boys Jaime and Nicolás. The family, which resides in the capital, stays at the hacienda during the summertime. Upon arriving at Tres Marías for the first time, Blanca immediately befriends a young boy named Pedro Tercero, who is the son of her father&#x27;s foreman. Blanca and Pedro grow up together as best friends despite them being of two different social and economic classes. During their teenage years, Blanca and Pedro Tercero eventually become lovers. After an earthquake that destroys part of the hacienda and leaves Esteban injured, the Truebas move permanently to Las Tres Marías. Clara spends her time teaching, caring for her husband&#x27;s battered body, and writing in her journals while Blanca is sent to a convent school and the twin boys back to an English boarding school, both of which are located in the city. Blanca fakes an illness so as to be sent back to Las Tres Marías, where she can be with Pedro Tercero, but when she arrives home she finds that Pedro Tercero has been banished from the hacienda by Esteban on account of his revolutionary socialist ideas. Pedro Tercero meets with Blanca in secret adopting disguises while also spreading his ideas in the form of song to neighboring haciendas.

A visiting French count to the hacienda, Jean de Satigny, reveals Blanca&#x27;s nightly romps with Pedro Tercero to her father. Esteban furiously goes after his daughter and brutally whips her. When Clara expresses horror at his actions, Esteban slaps her, knocking out her front teeth. Clara decides to never speak to him again, reclaims her maiden name and moves out of Tres Marías and back to the city, taking Blanca with her. Esteban, furious and lonely, blames Pedro Tercero for the whole matter; putting a price on the boy&#x27;s head with the corrupt local police. At this point, Pedro Segundo deserts Esteban, telling him he does not want to be around when Trueba inevitably catches his son. Enraged by Pedro Segundo&#x27;s departure, Trueba begins hunting for Pedro Tercero himself, eventually tracking him down to a small shack near his hacienda. He only succeeds in cutting off three of Pedro&#x27;s fingers, and is filled with regret for his uncontrollable furies.

Blanca finds out she is pregnant with Pedro Tercero&#x27;s child. Esteban, desperate to save the family honor, gets Blanca to marry the French count by telling her that he has killed Pedro Tercero. At first, Blanca gets along with her new husband, but she leaves him when she discovers his participation in sexual fantasies with the servants. Blanca quietly returns to the Trueba household and gives birth to her daughter, Alba. Meanwhile, Jaime and Nicholas both fall in love with a young drug addict named Amanda; Amanda initially loves Nicholas and becomes pregnant with his child. Jaime has to perform an abortion, ruining his relationship with Nicholas. Amanda and her little brother Miguel stay for a short time at the Trueba house; Miguel is able to witness Alba&#x27;s birth, his future lover. 

Esteban Trueba eventually moves to the Trueba house in the capital as well, although he continues to spend periods of time in Tres Marías. He becomes isolated from every member of his family except for little Alba, whom he is very fond of. Esteban runs as a senator for the Conservative Party but is nervous about whether or not he will win. Clara speaks to him, through signs, informing him that &quot;those who have always won will win again&quot; – this becomes his motto. Clara then begins to speak to Esteban through signs, although she keeps her promise and never actually speaks to him again. A few years later, Clara dies peacefully and Esteban is overwhelmed with grief.

Alba is a solitary child who enjoys playing make-believe in the basement of the house and painting the walls of her room. Blanca has become very poor since leaving Jean de Satigny&#x27;s house, getting a small income out of selling pottery and giving pottery classes to mentally ill children, and is once again dating Pedro Tercero, now a revolutionary singer/songwriter. Alba and Pedro are fond of each other, but do not know they are father and daughter, although Pedro suspects this. Alba is also fond of her uncles. Nicolás is eventually kicked out by his father, supposedly moving to North America.

When she is older, Alba attends a local college where she meets Miguel, now a grown man, and becomes his lover. Miguel is a revolutionary, and out of love for him, Alba involves herself in student protests against the conservative government. After the victory of the People&#x27;s Party (a socialist movement), Alba celebrates with Miguel.

Fearing a Communist dictatorship, Esteban Trueba and his fellow politicians plan a military coup of the socialist government. However, when the military coup is set into action, the military men relish their power and grow out of control. Esteban&#x27;s son Jaime is killed by power-driven soldiers along with other supporters of the government. After the coup, people are regularly kidnapped and tortured. Esteban helps Blanca and Pedro Tercero flee to Canada, where the couple finally find their happiness.

The military regime attempts to eliminate all traces of opposition and eventually comes for Alba. She is made the prisoner of Colonel Esteban García, the son of Esteban Trueba&#x27;s and Pancha Garcia&#x27;s illegitimate son, and hence the grandson of Esteban Trueba. During an earlier visit to the Trueba house, García had molested Alba as a child. In pure hatred of her privileged life and eventual inheritance, García tortures Alba repeatedly, looking for information on Miguel. He rapes her, thus completing the cycle that Esteban Trueba put into motion when he raped Pancha García. When Alba loses her will to live, she is visited by Clara&#x27;s spirit who tells her not to wish for death, since it can easily come, but to wish to live. She begins to write down her family&#x27;s story in her mind. 

García, fearful of his growing attachment to Alba, discards her. Esteban Trueba manages to free Alba with the help of Miguel and Tránsito Soto, his old friend and the brothel madam. After helping Alba write their memoir, Esteban Trueba dies in the arms of Alba, accompanied by Clara&#x27;s spirit; he is smiling, having avoided Férula&#x27;s prophecy that he will die like a dog. Alba is pregnant, though whether the child is Miguel&#x27;s or the product of her rape is unknown. Alba embraces this ambiguity, however, loving her unborn child as above all, it is her own. Alba resolves that she will not seek vengeance on those who have injured her, choosing to believe in the hope that one day the human cycle of hate and revenge will be broken. Alba is revealed to be the narrator of the novel, which she writes while she waits for Miguel and for the birth of her child.

==Main characters==
Some of the characters&#x27; names are significant, particularly the women&#x27;s names, which often indicate the personalities of the characters. The names Nívea, Clara, Blanca, and Alba are more or less synonyms, and this is mentioned as a family tradition. (Nívea means snow-white, and can be translated as &quot;white&quot; as can all the others, though they have specific meanings.) Férula&#x27;s name means &quot;rod&quot; in Latin; when used in Spanish it refers to an object used to immobilize a limb, such as a splint or cast.

===Clara del Valle Trueba===
Clara (one of its translations is the equivalent of English &quot;clear&quot;, although it is also a common female name) is the key female figure in the novel. She is a clairvoyant and telekinetic who is rarely attentive to domestic tasks, but she holds her family together with her love for them and her uncanny predictions. She is the youngest daughter of Severo and Nívea del Valle, wife of Esteban Trueba, and mother of Blanca, Jaime, and Nicolás. Even as a child her strangeness is noticed and seen as a threat to many in her community. Otherwise, her family and devoted Nanny protect her from her strangeness. She and her uncle Marcos use her powers to run a fortune-telling centre as she develops other paranormal activities like dream reading. Her uncle eventually leaves in a primitive airplane he built himself, disappearing for many months, assumed dead but later is found to die instead as the result of a &#x27;mysterious African plague&#x27; contracted during his travels. Clara practices divining and moving inanimate objects, most notably a three-legged table, and she is surrounded by friends such as the psychic Mora sisters and The Poet. Severo and Nívea del Valle are main characters in another Allende novel. As Clara grows up, she develops her abilities and is even able to communicate with ghosts and spirits. Clara represents love and cherishment. Clara&#x27;s marriage to Esteban Trubea is something she accepts but she never truly loves him and knows from the beginning that she will never do so. She is uninterested in material things and takes for granted her own high economic standing. It is not until later, after great tragedy, that she takes the role of helper/servant instead of dreamy bystander.

===Esteban Trueba===
Esteban Trueba is the central male character of the novel and is one of the story&#x27;s main narrators along with his granddaughter Alba. In his youth, he seeks the mermaid-like and green-haired Rosa the Beautiful, daughter of Severo and Nívea del Valle, toiling in the mines to earn a suitable fortune so that he can support her. However, she dies by accidental poisoning while he is working in the mines, a cruel stroke of fate that hardens his heart. He works hard to develop his estate at Tres Marias (&quot;Three Marys,&quot; a nickname for Orion&#x27;s Belt), and seduces and rapes many local peasant women, fathering many illegitimate children, including Esteban García (by Pancha García, sister of Pedro Segundo). Although he eventually marries Clara (Rosa&#x27;s sister and youngest daughter of the Del Valles) and raises a large family, Esteban&#x27;s stubborn and violent ways alienate all those around him. Esteban has a tense relationship with his daughter Blanca but shows genuine love and devotion to his granddaughter Alba. Despite his often violent behavior, he is also devoted to his wife Clara, entering into a state of permanent mourning following her death. As a self-made man who earned all of his wealth from years of work spent improving Tres Marías, Esteban scorns communists and believes them to be lazy and stupid. Later in life, he turns to politics where he spends his money and effort trying to prevent the rising Socialist movement within the country. However, after the military coup he loses much of his power and suddenly has to face the fact that he has become an old and weak man. Yet it is not the loss of power, so much as the injury done to his country, that agonizes the highly patriotic Esteban. His realization that he desires the love of his family and peace in his country leads to a pivotal change in his character. In his last days, he slowly loses the rage that has been driving him all his life. He begins to make amends to the remaining members of his family—first, by helping Blanca and Pedro Tercero escape the country so they can live happily, and then, after Alba is kidnapped by the military, by persuading his longtime friend Tránsito Soto (who has influence in the military) to help him rescue her. With the success of both of his efforts, Esteban dies happily, knowing that he has achieved Clara&#x27;s posthumous forgiveness.

===Blanca Trueba===
Blanca (literally, &quot;white&quot;) is Clara and Esteban&#x27;s first-born daughter. She spends her childhood between the Truebas&#x27; house in the capital and Tres Marías, where she forms an intense connection with a boy named Pedro Tercero García, the son of Esteban&#x27;s foreman. Their friendship endures, though they only see each other in the summer, and upon adolescence they become lovers. Their love persists even after Pedro is run out of the hacienda by Esteban, because he is putting communist ideas in the other workers&#x27; heads. After she becomes pregnant with Pedro Tercero&#x27;s child, her father forces her to marry Count Jean de Satigny, whom she does not love. After Blanca leaves the Count and returns to the Trueba home, she sees Pedro sporadically, resisting his attempts to persuade her to marry, but their relationship continues. Blanca&#x27;s reconciliation with her father eventually allows her to flee to Canada with Pedro, where they finally are able to achieve happiness together. Blanca is also able to earn large amounts of money for the first time by selling her clay figurines, which are seen as folk art by Canadians.

===Pedro Tercero García===
Pedro is the son of the tenant and foreman of Tres Marías, Pedro Segundo García. At a young age, he falls in love with Blanca and is the father of her only child, Alba. In his youth, he spreads socialist ideals to the workers on the hacienda, and later he becomes a revolutionary and a songwriter (his character may be modeled after revolutionary songwriter Victor Jara). After the coup d&#x27;état in his country, he and Blanca exile themselves to Canada with Esteban&#x27;s help. It is mentioned that he resumes his political crusade during his exile in Canada where his music is embraced in translation even if &quot;chickens and foxes are underdeveloped creatures&quot; in comparison with the &quot;eagles and wolves&quot; of the North.

===Alba Trueba de Satigny===
Alba (Spanish for &quot;Dawn,&quot; Latin for &quot;white&quot;) is the daughter of Blanca and Pedro Tercero García, although for many years of her life she was led to believe that Count de Satigny was her father. From before her birth, her grandmother Clara decreed that she was blessed by the stars. Because of this, Clara said she didn&#x27;t need to go to school; as a result, Alba was raised at home until she was seven. The novel ends with Esteban&#x27;s death, and Alba sits alone in the vast Trueba mansion beside his body. The last paragraph reveals that she is pregnant, although she does not know (or care) whether the child is Miguel&#x27;s or the product of the rapes that she endured at the hands of security police, during her imprisonment.

=== Severo and Nívea del Valle ===
Severo (literally, &quot;severe&quot;) and Nívea (&quot;snowy&quot;) are the parents of Rosa, Clara, and several other children. Severo&#x27;s candidacy for the Liberal Party of Chile promptly came to an end after someone tried to poison him, but killed his daughter Rosa instead. Nívea, however, would come to become a prominent social activist for women&#x27;s liberation. The couple pass away in a gruesome car accident in which Nívea is decapitated and her head lost. The details of the accident were hidden from their daughter Clara, because she was pregnant at the time. However, her intuition brings her to the location of the lost head, which ends up being hidden in the basement since the body had already been buried.

=== The Nanny ===
Having served the Del Valle and Trueba families all her life, Nana is emotionally close to all the children that she has taken care of, especially Clara. She even takes care of Clara&#x27;s children after Severo&#x27;s and Nívea&#x27;s death. Nana passes away in an earthquake and is buried without fanfare. Her body is later moved to the mausoleum with Clara&#x27;s and Rosa&#x27;s bodies.

=== Rosa del Valle ===
The oldest daughter of Severo and Nívea, Rosa was born with green hair, gold eyes and great beauty. Her unearthly beauty intimidates everyone in the village except for Esteban Trueba, who is deeply enamored of her and seeks her hand in marriage. Rosa waits patiently while Esteban slowly accumulates wealth by working in the mines so that he will feel worthy of Rosa. Esteban returns to find that Rosa has died from a dose of poison meant for her father. Though never truly forgetting Rosa, Esteban marries her sister Clara instead.

=== Jaime Trueba ===
Jaime is the son of Clara and Esteban Trueba. A shy, bookish, and compassionate doctor who treats the poor, he serves as a contrast to his outgoing twin brother Nicolas and his bad-tempered father. Jaime has always had a strained relationship with his father, especially given Jaime&#x27;s revolutionary ideals. He becomes friends with the Candidate whilst under the impression that the revolution is to be peaceful. Jaime also becomes good friends with Alba, whom he treats as a sister. He is summoned to the Presidential Palace during the coup and is killed for refusing to announce that the president has drunkenly committed suicide. Esteban doesn&#x27;t believe it until Jaime appears in spirit to Clara, showing her how he had been murdered by the regime.

Jaime may be inspired by the personal doctor Arturo Jiron of the Chilean president Salvador Allende.

==School curricula==
The novel has been taught in a significant number of school curricula around the world, notably for its use of magical realism, and as a translated Latin American novel. Educational organizations such as the International Baccalaureate recognize it as a world literature study book.

=== Censorship in the United States ===
However, &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot; in United States school curriculum has been challenged on multiple occasions, most often for the stated reasons of explicit sexual content and depictions of violence. For instance, in Virginia, a parent initially brought attention to the novel’s explicit content in 1997 by passing out “packets of excerpts from &quot;The House of Spirits&quot; with the heading “Would you allow your 16-year-old daughter to read this material? And if not, why should the public school be allowed to require my 16-year-old daughter to read this material?” Despite this demonstration, the Virginia county’s school board voted not to ban the novel from school curriculum. Similarly, in Maryland, the novel was brought to the attention of the school board in Montgomery County for its explicit content, specifically the depiction of necrophilia—“in which a young medical student kisses a female corpse,” referring to the molestation of the body of Rosa the Beautiful. In California counties in 1999 and 2000, the novel was challenged for its anti-Christian views, pornographic depictions, and “violence and sexual abuse”.

==Traditions==
After the debut of &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;, Allende began to follow a rule of starting to write all her books on January 8. She is quoted as saying:
==Film and theatrical adaptations==
In 1993, the book was adapted into a film (&quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;) by Danish director Bille August. The movie starred Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba, Meryl Streep as Clara del Valle Trueba, Winona Ryder as Blanca Trueba, Glenn Close as Férula Trueba and Antonio Banderas as Pedro Tercero García. While the film won some minor international awards, it was widely viewed as a critical failure. Two oft-cited reasons were its diffusely episodic structure and its cast of mostly Anglo-American actors in Latin American roles. The film grossed $4.8 million in its first two weeks of release in Germany and went on to gross more than $55 million in Europe. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $6 million.

A theatrical adaptation of the novel was presented at Seattle&#x27;s Book-It Repertory Theatre in 2007.

The novel has also been adapted for the theater in a version written by Caridad Svich, which was commissioned by Repertorio Espanol in New York City. That adaptation premiered in 2009 and received the HOLA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Playwriting from the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors. Unlike the film and the previous adaptation, this version was written and performed in Spanish and has been staged in Latin American countries such as Chile and Costa Rica. Svich also wrote an English language version of the play which won the 2011 American Theatre Critics Association Primus Prize for its production at Denver Center Theatre Company in 2010.

On May 23, 2018, it was announced that Hulu was developing a television series adaptation of the novel with production company FilmNation Entertainment. Allende is expected to serve as an executive producer on the project. On October 19, 2021, it was announced that Eva Longoria would star in the project.

<doc id="1195053" wikidata="Q7277104" url="?curid=1195053" title="RMS Segwun">
<text>RMS &quot;Segwun&quot; is the oldest operating steam driven vessel in North America, built in 1887 as &quot;Nipissing&quot; to cruise the Muskoka Lakes in the Muskoka, Ontario, Canada, a resort area with many lakes and rivers. Early in the 20th century, Muskoka was poorly served by roads. Vacationers were transported to lodges, or private cottages, via a fleet of steamships. &quot;Segwun&quot; is the oldest of only three ships in the world still carrying the status of Royal Mail Ship, and the only steamer.

Ports of call included Gravenhurst, Bracebridge, Beaumaris, Port Sandfield, Port Carling and Bala.

==History==

===Construction===

In the 1920s the Muskoka Lakes saw strong growth in tourism as the Canadian economy recovered from the trauma of World War I. By 1924 the Muskoka Lakes Navigation Company found that the six steamers then serving the lakes were growing inadequate to the task and looked to add to their fleet. Rather than commission an entirely new boat, management decided to convert the decommissioned SS &quot;Nipissing&quot; from a paddle-wheeler to a twin propeller passenger steamer. &quot;Nipissing&quot;″s wrought iron hull was built on the Clyde in 1887 and was in service on the lakes from 1887 through 1915. When Segwun was rebuilt on the hull of the second SS &quot;Nipissing&quot; she was also converted from a side paddle wheel steamer with a walking beam engine into the current two counter-rotating propellers.

The conversion was performed at the Navigation Company&#x27;s yard in Gravenhurst, Ontario during the fall and winter of 1924–5, at which time the bulk of &quot;Nipissing&quot;″s machinery was removed, including her engines. Workers installed a new Scotch marine boiler along with two secondhand Doty compound steam engines and stack. The bulk of the two lower decks were retained.

A carving of the Phoenix carried atop of &quot;Segwun&quot;″s pilothouse is a replica of the one originally carried on &quot;Segwun&quot; in 1925. The first Phoenix statue was carved for a second version of SS &quot;Nipissing&quot; launched in 1887 to replace the original &quot;Nipissing&quot; destroyed in a fire the previous year. The new version of the &quot;Nipissing&quot; inherited the engines from the original &quot;Nipissing&quot; – which had to be raised from the bottom of the lake after the fire, so the second version carried on both the name and steam engine. At the close of the navigation season in 1925, caught fire while being laid up, so in subsequent years the Phoenix was placed on &quot;the Sag&quot; where it was lost by fire a second time in 1969. SS &quot;Sagamo&quot; was not rebuilt; however the Phoenix did rise from its ashes and is now carried by the ship for which it was intended.

The ship was launched in June, 1925 for the summer passenger season. While originally she was intended to retain the &quot;Nipissing&quot; name, the extent of the alterations were so extensive that the Navigation Company chose to rename her &quot;Segwun&quot;, an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;springtime&quot;.

===Remodel===
The Navigation Company underwent a change in ownership at the end of World War II, when Major Hugh C. MacLean, publisher, sold his 90% interest in the company to a Toronto businessman, Gordon Douglas Fairley. MacLean had owned his share in the company for several decades and the steamship line benefited from promotion in MacLean&#x27;s publications. Perhaps anticipating another postwar economic boom similar to the 1920s Fairley made some significant investments in the company&#x27;s fleet.

In the off season of 1946–7 &quot;Segwun&quot; was remodeled. The gentleman&#x27;s lounge and two staterooms toward the aft of the upper deck were removed and a new series of seven carpeted staterooms were added in their place and connected to the forward oak-paneled lounge. The open space formerly present on that deck just aft of the stack was closed in. Additionally a new steel bulkhead salvaged from 
&quot;Medora&quot; was installed in the forward hold to create a crew sleeping area. The changes were generally favorable, but at the cost of increasing the craft&#x27;s sensitivity to the wind. These changes finalized the silhouette of the ship to this day.

===Refit===
On 16 September 1949 a fire broke out on , then sailing the Great Lakes and docked at Toronto. Inadequate fire alarms and firefighting equipment allowed the fire to rage out of control resulting in between 118 and 139 deaths. In the aftermath, the Ministry of Transport imposed new fire control requirements on steamships. The Muskoka Lakes Lines, then owner of &quot;Segwun&quot; and the remaining steamships of the Muskoka Lakes Navigation and Hotel Company, already suffering from declining passenger and freight business due to new competition from the automobile and trucking lines, lacked the resources to re-fit the entire fleet. The Muskoka Lakes Lines filed bankruptcy and the ships were repossessed by the Navigation Company who chose to fit the required equipment only on the flagship &quot;Sagamo&quot; and her companion &quot;Segwun.&quot; &quot;Segwun&quot; was fitted with new hoses and hydrants and sailed the 1950 season, but her occupancy certificate was cut from 243 to only 100 by the Ministry.

===Accident===
In the 1958 season &quot;Segwun&quot; received a new captain to replace the aging crew who had long manned the ship. Unfortunately, on his first trip, the captain bumped the swing bridge at Port Carling, almost disabling it, then later struck the concrete dock at the Lockmaster&#x27;s house, resulting in a badly dented forepeak.

===&quot;Segwun&quot; Museum===
Most of these vessels on the Muskoka Lakes were broken up or lost to fire, when roads were built. &quot;Segwun&quot;, and the fleet&#x27;s former flagship, RMS &quot;Sagamo&quot;, the last two remaining vessels in service, were retired in 1958 and &quot;Segwun&quot; spent decades moored at the Town Dock in Gravenhurst. &quot;Sagamo&quot;, converted into a floating restaurant, was destroyed in a fire in 1969. Segwun Steamboat Museum, moored next to &quot;Sagamo&quot;, survived the fire.

===Restoration===
From 1972 through 1981, &quot;Segwun&quot; was restored, and put back into service on 27 June 1981. 
&quot;Segwun&quot; still maintains its Canada Post &#x27;R.M.S.&#x27; designation as an official Royal Mail Ship. As part of a fundraising venture, she once carried her own private label wine which was distributed throughout Ontario by the L.C.B.O. In 2001 &amp; 2002, &quot;Segwun&quot; was voted &#x27;Best Large Attraction&#x27; by Attractions Canada.

==Current operations==
Segwun now provides short sightseeing excursions, lunch and sunset dinner cruises. She is owned and operated by a registered charity – Muskoka Steamships and Discovery Centre.

==Commemorative stamp tribute==
In 1987 Canada Post honoured RMS &quot;Segwun&quot; with a 36 cent commemorative stamp, one of four commemorating the 1987 centennial of Gravenhurst, Ont. A framed enlarged copy of the stamp hangs in the lobby of the Administration Offices of the District Municipality of Muskoka.

<doc id="1195057" wikidata="Q1408498" url="?curid=1195057" title="Ocean Software">
<text>Ocean Software Ltd was a British software development company that became one of the biggest European video game developers and publishers of the 1980s and 1990s.

The company was founded by David Ward and Jon Woods and was based in Manchester. Ocean developed dozens of games for a variety of home computer systems such as the ZX Spectrum, Oric 1, Commodore 64, Dragon 32/64, MSX, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16, Atari ST, Amiga, IBM PC, BBC Micro and video game consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, and Mega Drive.

== History ==
Jon Woods and David Ward created Spectrum Games as a mail-order business in 1983 after being inspired by the success of Liverpool-based software houses Imagine Software, Bug-Byte and Software Projects. Their initial catalogue was based around clones of arcade video games like &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;Missile Command&quot; for various home computers including the ZX81, ZX Spectrum and VIC-20.

While trying to sell their titles into high street stores it became clear that the company name was confusing to owners of machines other than the ZX Spectrum. The company was renamed Ocean Software leading to some of its games being re-released with different titles so the &quot;Berzerk&quot; clone &quot;Frenzy&quot; was reissued as &quot;Robotics&quot; and &quot;Missile Attack&quot; became &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

By September 1984 the success of Ocean allowed Woods and Ward to invest £50,000 in a new software house in return for a 50% stake in the company. U.S. Gold was created by Geoff Brown, owner of Centresoft software distribution, and specialised in importing American Commodore 64 games for the UK market. U.S. Gold had no developers to port the Commodore games for the UK&#x27;s most popular home computer, the ZX Spectrum, so Ocean produced the conversions of titles such as &quot;Beach Head, Raid over Moscow&quot; and &quot;Tapper&quot; through its external development team, Platinum Productions.

In October 1984 Ocean bought the name and branding of Imagine Software from the liquidators of the failed software house. Although originally intended to be a label exclusively for arcade conversions, the Imagine logo would also be used on a number of original titles, as well as on UK releases of games licensed from Spanish developers Dinamic Software.

In 1985 Ocean and U.S. Gold collaborated again to launch a new label, The Hit Squad, for releasing compilation packages. The first release featured Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot;, U.S. Gold&#x27;s &quot;Beach Head&quot;, &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; from Software Projects and &quot;Sabre Wulf&quot; by Ultimate Play the Game — all titles which had sold over a million copies — which led to the title &quot;They Sold A Million&quot;. The compilation went on to sell over a million copies, as did the second and third instalments in the series.

Over half of Ocean&#x27;s releases for 8-bit home computers were coin-op conversions and licensed games. While initially focused on British licences, such as &quot;Hunchback&quot; from Manchester&#x27;s Century Electronics, Liverpool&#x27;s Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Olympic decathlete Daley Thompson, its attention soon shifted to film licences, with &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; becoming its first movie tie-in in 1985.

In 1986, a deal was signed with Taito and Data East for home versions of their arcade games, such as &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot; and &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;. &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; was the first title to be converted to 16-bit platforms by Ocean France, a company created by Ocean and Marc Djan in 1986. The studio produced most of its 16-bit arcade conversions until 1991, when the company became Ocean&#x27;s French marketing and sales department.

===Success of film-licensed games===
1986 also produced titles based on the films &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Short Circuit&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot;, as well as the first licensed &quot;Batman&quot; game. But it would be its 1988 game &quot;RoboCop&quot;, adapted from Data East&#x27;s arcade game based on the film &quot;RoboCop&quot;, that would go on to become the most successful movie licence in history by the end of the decade.

In 1987, Ocean via Imagine had a deal with Spanish publisher Dinamic Software to release four titles, before launching its own line in the United Kingdom. The following year, Ocean signed a deal with Special FX Software, a company formed by ex-Ocean employees to release titles for home computers, starting with &quot;Firefly&quot;.

In 1989, &quot;The Hit Squad&quot; branding reappeared as the new budget re-release label for Ocean&#x27;s 8-bit back catalogue. The entire series consisted of 122 titles over seven 8-bit formats. Their uniform style and numbering has led to them becoming highly collectable. Meanwhile, the company was working on its next big film tie-in, which would be specifically aimed at the new graphically superior 16-bit computers, the Atari ST and Amiga.

The success of &quot;RoboCop&quot; established Ocean globally, and it would be Warner Bros. who suggested to Ocean that it produce a tie-in based on its forthcoming &quot;Batman&quot; movie. The resulting game was another tremendous hit for the company and is now regarded as one of the greatest video game/film tie-ins. The game was used as the basis of the Amiga 500 &quot;Batman Pack&quot;, which became one of the most successful hardware/software bundles of all time. In 1990, Ocean launched its new subsidiary, Ocean of America, led by former Data East boss Ray Musci to publish titles for the American market.

Ocean was voted Best 8-bit Software House of the Year at the 1989 Golden Joystick Awards, along with awards for its 8-bit and 16-bit conversions of &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;.

===Merger with Infogrames (1996)===
In 1996, Ocean&#x27;s parent company Ocean International Ltd. announced they would be purchased by and merge with French publisher Infogrames for £100 million. This was the first key purchase in Infogrames&#x27; &quot;Expand through Acquisition&quot; policy. After the merger, Ocean remained as a separate division of Infogrames, continuing to publish and distribute its own games, such as &quot;F-22: Air Dominance Fighter&quot;., with the UK subsidiary beginning to distribute titles from Infogrames, such as &quot;V-Rally&quot;.

In 1997, Infogrames&#x27; French publishing division Infogrames Télématique launched a European-focused online gaming website under the Ocean brand called &quot;Oceanline&quot;. The website offered up simplified online versions of a majority of Infogrames&#x27; game catalog.

On 8 February 1998, Bruno Bonnell announced that Ocean Software Limited would be rebranded as Infogrames United Kingdom Limited in order to standardize its various subsidiaries under the Infogrames banner. Ocean of America, Inc. was later renamed as Infogrames Entertainment, Inc. Infogrames continued to use Ocean as a brand name for specific titles until the end of the year when the company quietly retired the brand in favour of their own. The last title published under the Ocean brand altogether was the North American release of &quot;GT 64: Championship Edition&quot; for the Nintendo 64.

===Aftermath===
Infogrames Entertainment, Inc. began to publish games under their own banner, replacing Infogrames&#x27; previous United States subsidiary I-Motion Inc. Infogrames Entertainment, Inc. was soon folded into Infogrames North America, Inc. — a renaming of Accolade — which then became Infogrames&#x27; United States division before being merged and folded into Infogrames, Inc., a renaming of GT Interactive.

The UK subsidiary continued to publish and distribute Infogrames&#x27; titles in the country, later being renamed as Atari United Kingdom Limited in 2003. In 2009, Bandai Namco Entertainment purchased Atari SA&#x27;s European assets, and the remains of Ocean Software currently lie under the hands as Bandai Namco Entertainment&#x27;s UK publishing and distribution division.

== Tape loaders ==
Starting with &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot; in 1984, games on the ZX Spectrum used the Speedlock protection system, which eventually included a countdown timer showing the time left to load a game. On the commodore 64 Ocean added a full screen graphic to look at and some catchy music to listen to during the loading of the tape. Several different Loaders were implemented over the years. 11 loaders are known to have been created for Ocean games. Some of the composers who created the music for the Ocean Loaders were Martin Galway, Jonathan Dunn, and Peter Clarke.

<doc id="1195063" wikidata="Q2920382" url="?curid=1195063" title="Convertible security">
<text>A convertible security is a financial instrument whose holder has the right to convert it into another security of the same issuer. Most convertible securities are convertible bonds or preferred stocks that pay regular interest and can be converted into shares of the issuer&#x27;s common stock. Convertible securities typically include other embedded options, such as call or put options. Consequently, determining the value of convertible securities can be a complex exercise. The complex valuation issue may attract specialized professional investors, including arbitrageurs and hedge funds who try to exploit disparities in the relationship between the price of the convertible security and the underlying common stock.

==Types==
Types of convertible securities include: 
*Convertible bond
*Reverse convertible bond
*Convertible preferred stock
*Asset-linked bond: Although a bond with an asset warrant is a type of convertible security, regular warrants are not. A regular warrant provides an equity option, where the holder may opt to buy newly issued shares at a determined exercise price and date. Equity capital notes are similar to warrants, except that there is no exercise price.
*Asset-linked note
*Bond with asset warrant

==Characteristics of convertible bonds and preferred stock==
Because convertibles are a hybrid security, their market price can be affected by both movements in interest rates (like a conventional bond) and the company&#x27;s stock price (because of the embedded option to convert to the underlying stock). The minimum price at which a convertible bond will trade is based on its fixed income characteristics: the stream of coupon payments and eventual maturity at par value. This is known as its &quot;bond equivalent&quot; or &quot;straight bond&quot; value. The price of the convertible bond will not drop below straight value if the stock price declines. In return for this degree of protection, investors who purchase a convertible bond rather than the underlying stock typically pay a premium over the stock&#x27;s current market price.

The price that the convertible investor effectively pays for the right to convert to common stock is called the &quot;market conversion price&quot;, and is calculated as shown below. The &quot;conversion ratio&quot; - the number of shares the investor receives when exchanging the bond for common stock - is specified in the bond&#x27;s indenture.

:formula_1

Once the actual market price of the underlying stock exceeds the market conversion price embedded in the convertible, any further rise in the stock price will drive up the convertible security&#x27;s price by at least the same percentage. Thus, the market conversion price can be thought of as a &quot;break-even point.&quot;

If the price of the stock decreases to the point that the straight bond value is much greater than the conversion value, the convertible will trade much like a straight bond. This is referred to as a &quot;bond equivalent&quot; or &quot;busted convertible.&quot;

==Advantages to the investor==
Convertible bonds generally provide a higher current yield than common stock due to their fixed income features and superior claim to the assets of the company in the event of default. If the value of the underlying common stock rises, the value of the convertible should rise as well. The investor can benefit from the stock&#x27;s upside movement by selling the bond without converting it to stock. Alternatively, the value of the common stock could fall, but in that case the convertible&#x27;s price will decline only to the point where it provides an acceptable return as a bond equivalent.

==Disadvantages to the investor==
Most convertibles contain a call provision that allows the issuer to force conversion to the common stock. Such a provision limits the value associated with potential growth in the stock price.

Convertibles typically have a lower yield than a nonconvertible, because the investor is receiving an additional right: that of conversion to the underlying stock. However, if the issuer&#x27;s business does not grow and prosper, the investor has an opportunity cost associated with lost current yield compared to a nonconvertible, and a capital loss if the convertible security&#x27;s price drops below the price the investor paid to purchase it.

<doc id="1195068" wikidata="Q7512366" url="?curid=1195068" title="Sigma Pi">
<text>Sigma Pi () is a collegiate fraternity in North America. As of 2021, it had more than 5,000 undergraduate members and over 118,000 alumni. The fraternity is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.

Founded on February 26, 1897, at Vincennes University by William R Kennedy, James T Kingsbury, George M Patterson, and Rolin R James, the group was initially known as Tau Phi Delta (). In 1907, the fraternity was renamed Sigma Pi. This change was instigated by Robert George Patterson (no relation to founder George M Patterson), a student at Ohio State University. Patterson had wanted to join the Sigma Pi literary society at Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois, but after his request to expand the society to OSU was declined, he approached Tau Phi Delta members, claiming to represent a historic fraternity called Sigma Pi that dated to the 18th century. Tau Phi Delta accepted Patterson&#x27;s invitation to merge and adopted the name Sigma Pi. Later, Patterson&#x27;s &quot;history&quot; of Sigma Pi was shown to be false, but the organization kept the name.

Sigma Pi oversees several charitable programs, including the Altruistic Campus Experience (ACE), and maintains the Sigma Pi Educational Foundation &quot;to assist needy and deserving students to complete their education, and to aid aged or disabled former students who are in need or worthy of assistance.&quot;

==History==

===Founders===
* Rolin Rosco James (October 16, 1879 – February 4, 1953): Born in Lincolnville, Indiana. Graduated from Vincennes University in 1900; A. B., Earlham College, 1902; Studied at Harvard Law School. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church and by profession, a consulting attorney.
* William Raper Kennedy (November 22, 1877 – December 5, 1944): Born in Vincennes, Indiana. Graduated Vincennes University in 1897. Served in the Spanish–American War and re-enlisted in the infantry a month after being discharged. He was continuously in military service and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the infantry. He was a faculty member at Culver Military Academy from 1905 until retiring in 1944.
* James Thompson Kingsbury (January 8, 1877 – October 1, 1950): Born in Lawrence County, Illinois. Descended from the Kingsbury family who settled in Massachusetts in 1615. Graduated Vincennes University in 1897; A. B. University of Illinois 1899, LL.B 1902. Practiced law in Bisbee, Arizona. He was a member of the Christian Church and of Masonic Lodges in Tombstone, Arizona and Phoenix.
* George Martin Patterson (November 7, 1877 – April 7, 1960): Born in Palmyra, Township, Knox County, Indiana. His ancestors settled in Vincennes before Indiana became a state and were prominent in the development of that part of the country. Served as the Deputy Recorder of Knox County and then followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps of farming.

===Founding and early history (1897–1908)===
On January 26, 1897, Charlotte N. Mallote, a professor of Latin and French, spoke to a group of students during chapel hour at Vincennes University about College Fraternities. One month later, on February 26, 1897, a new literary society had its first meeting, founded by James, Kennedy, Patterson, and Kingsbury. The first two initiates of the society were Samuel and Maurice Bayard, who joined before a name or constitution was established. The constitution, name, and first ritual were developed at the Bayards&#x27; home. The founders soon agreed upon a name, and the society was christened Tau Phi Delta (). By the end of its first year in 1898, Tau Phi Delta had 10 members, but the new Fraternity encountered membership struggles at the turn of the 20th century, with many of America&#x27;s young men leaving to fight in the Spanish–American War. Personal endeavors were paused, while national efforts and resources focused on the war in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. Key members of Tau Phi Delta, William Raper Kennedy, Lee B. Purcell, and Maurice Bayard, all left to fight in the war, leaving James as the sole member by the end of the war. James restored the society by initiating five new members shortly after the turn of the 20th century. These new members pressured James to change the name to Theta Gamma Psi (), but James successfully argued to keep the name Tau Phi Delta. In 1903–1904, the Fraternity had grown so large that it stopped meeting at Vincennes and began meeting at The Bayard Cottage, considered the fraternity&#x27;s first chapter house. In 1907, Tau Phi Delta began meeting at the old colonial residence of Judge J.P.L Weems. It was in the Niblack-Weems household that Tau Phi Delta was rechristened as Sigma Pi. The home would later host the first national congress.

In 1904–05, Tau Phi Delta sought expansion to other universities. Though rejected, a local fraternity at Indiana University petitioned to become the second chapter, and Tau Phi Delta began talks with other local fraternities at nearby universities. These discussions ultimately ended without expansion. Additional chapters would eventually be added after Tau Phi Delta became Sigma Pi on February 11, 1907.

In May 1908 the fraternity held its first National Convocation in Vincennes and charters were granted to groups at the University of Illinois (Phi chapter) and Ohio State University (Gamma chapter). Francis L. Lisman was elected as the fraternity&#x27;s first Grand Sage.

===Patterson episode: how Sigma Pi got its name===
Robert George Patterson (no relation to the founder George M. Patterson) was inspired by William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s membership in the Sigma Pi literary society at Illinois College. Unable to attend Illinois College, Patterson tried unsuccessfully to have the society expand to Ohio State University and contacted an unrelated fraternity at the University of Toronto, also called Sigma Pi, about expansion. Failing at these, Patterson fabricated a history of Sigma Pi, claiming it was founded in 1752 at the College of William &amp; Mary with members such as James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert E. Lee. He then contacted Tau Phi Delta, which accepted his fabricated history and consolidated under the Sigma Pi name.

In 1909, Patterson&#x27;s claims unraveled. The World Almanac listed Sigma Pi Fraternity, with its fabricated history and listing William Jennings Bryan as an alumnus. Bryan, a member of Delta Chi and the unrelated Sigma Pi literary society, informed the magazine of the error. Furthermore, William Raimond Baird rejected Sigma Pi Fraternity&#x27;s request for inclusion in his directory. Baird wrote &quot;all statements concerning the alleged origin of this society are inherently incredible.&quot; He suggested the story seemed to &quot;be the product of a rather sophomoric imagination.&quot; Sigma Pi Fraternity, still unaware of Patterson&#x27;s fabrications, appealed to Baird to reconsider. Baird refused and published an article criticizing Sigma Pi Fraternity. Patterson was expelled from Sigma Pi, and records bearing his name were deleted. The fraternity only later acknowledged this incident in its official history.

Following Patterson&#x27;s expulsion, Sigma Pi had five chapters: Vincennes University, University of Illinois, Ohio State University, Temple University, and the University of Pennsylvania. The fraternity redesigned its badge, coat of arms, and ritual.

===Early Growth: 1910 to World War II===
Sigma Pi continued to grow, co-founding the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1910. On July 15, 1911, Sigma Pi&#x27;s official publication, &quot;The Emerald&quot;, was first published. It would not be regularly published until 1914. The fraternity established its first chapter west of the Mississippi River in 1913 (Iota chapter at the University of California, Berkeley). World War I saw only Kappa chapter at Temple University close, though other chapters operated minimally. By 1918 there were 14 chapters.

The fraternity published &quot;The Songs of Sigma Pi&quot; in 1920 and established its first chapter in the American south (Omicron chapter at Tulane University). The Sigma Pi Foundation, an endowment fund, was established in 1922 and formally chartered in Indiana in 1923.

Sigma Pi doubled its chapters between 1920 and 1927 and established a national office on May 16, 1927. It first operated out of Roselle, NJ, then Elizabeth, NJ. The fraternity published its first pledge manual in 1931. The &quot;Keryx&quot; newsletter also began publication in 1931. In 1937, the Mississippi State University chapter (Alpha-Lambda) became the first new chapter formed from a colony rather than consolidation. James Hauser became the first field representative that same year.

By May 1940, Sigma Pi had 34 active and 2 inactive chapters and had begun using the &quot;I Believe&quot; pledge manual. World War II drastically reduced the fraternity to 11 active chapters by war&#x27;s end.

===Post War era: 1945 to 1980===
Following World War II, Sigma Pi benefited from increased college enrollments under the GI Bill. By 1950, it had 53 chapters (7 inactive), growing to 63 chapters by 1960. The Byron R. Lewis Educational Foundation, started in 1945 and incorporated in 1952, provided scholarships to members. Beta-Kappa chapter at Arizona State University, chartered in 1951, was unique for having founder James Thompson Kingsbury assist in its founding.

During the 1960s the fraternity added 39 chapters, reaching a total of 109. In 1961, Vincennes University donated the Shadowwood estate to the fraternity for use as its national headquarters. The national office moved into Shadowwood in 1963 after renovations.

In 1964, four chapters of the Delta Kappa fraternity joined Sigma Pi after being impacted by a 1953 New York State Board of Regents edict prohibiting national fraternities at state-funded universities.

William J. Cutbirth became the first Sigma Pi to be president of the North American Interfraternity Conference, serving from 1974 to 1976.

===International era, 1980 to the present===
The fraternity chartered 42 new chapters in the 1980s.

Sigma Pi became an international organization in 1984 with the chartering of Zeta-Iota chapter at Western Ontario in Canada. The fraternity subsequently changed its name to Sigma Pi Fraternity International.

In 1988, the fraternity received the Rose Hill Farmstead from the family of founder George Martin Patterson and sold the property to the Sigma Pi Educational Foundation in 1992.

The fraternity moved its international offices to Brentwood, TN in 2003, selling the Shadowwood Estate in 2005. The offices again moved in 2007. In 2013, the fraternity purchased the Mitchell House in Lebanon, Tennessee for its headquarters, holding the grand opening in 2014. The Executive Office later moved to Nashville.

===Alpha chapter at Vincennes University: preserving Sigma Pi&#x27;s history===
The Alpha chapter at Vincennes University closed in 1910 and was reactivated in 1965 with special dispensation from the NIC, which then prohibited chapters at two-year junior colleges. The success of the Alpha chapter led the NIC to allow chapters at all junior colleges in 1970. A clock tower at Vincennes University commemorates the foundation of Sigma Pi. The Alpha chapter remains active.

==Symbols and traditions==
The fraternity&#x27;s primary colors are lavender and white, with gold as an auxiliary color. Its symbol is the owl. Its flower is the lavender orchid, with the white rose and lilacs as alternates and goldenrod as an auxiliary. Its jewel is the emerald. The fraternity&#x27;s publication is &quot;The Emerald&quot;.

===Sigma Pi Motto===
The mother of the first two initiates, Samuel and Maurice Bayard, chose the fraternity&#x27;s motto from Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;A Death in the Desert&quot;:

===Five ideals===
Sigma Pi Fraternity promotes five basic ideals or pillars:

# To establish a brotherhood. 
# To establish and maintain an aristocracy of learning.
# To raise the standards of morality and develop character.
# To diffuse culture and encourage chivalry.
# To promote the spirit of civic righteousness and quicken the national conscience.

===Creed===
The Sigma Pi Creed expresses the fraternity&#x27;s ideals:

=== Publications ===
Sigma Pi has several publications:

* The Emerald of Sigma Pi, commonly referred to as &quot;The Emerald&quot;, is published three times a year. Louis L. Moore (&quot;Kappa&quot;, Temple University) edited the first issue, published July 15, 1911. Due to financial constraints, regular publication began in 1914 under Luther C. Weeks (&quot;Eta&quot;, Purdue University).
* The Keryx (first published in July 1931) is the esoteric publication of Sigma Pi.
* The Manual of Ceremonies contains the rituals of Sigma Pi.
* I Believe is the Sigma Pi pledge manual, first published in 1940.
* Who&#x27;s Who in Sigma Pi is a directory of every member, published at least once a decade.
* Songs of Sigma Pi was published in 1922, later superseded by Sigma Pi Sings in 1968.

==Governance==
Sigma Pi has chapters, Alumni Clubs, and colonies. A colony is a group of men interested in forming a chapter. An active chapter consists of at least twenty-five active members in good standing with their university and the Grand chapter. Alumni Clubs are for Sigma Pi alumni.

Sigma Pi is governed by its Constitution and Bylaws, as well as NIC rules. Individual chapters are also subject to university regulations and the local Interfraternity Council. Membership is offered to men meeting requirements, which can vary by campus. Honorary membership may be extended to relatives of members, alumni, and faculty or administration. The Constitution and Bylaws are reviewed and amended at biennial Convocations. Meetings are governed by Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order.

===Grand Chapter===
The Grand Chapter, headed by the Grand Council, has full jurisdiction over the fraternity. It elects officers, amends governing documents, and holds biennial Convocations. Each chapter is required to send one delegate.

The Grand Council, consisting of seven elected officers, exercises governmental power between Grand Chapter sessions. In 2010, Sigma Pi shifted the Grand Council to a Board of Governors model, focusing on policy creation, while the Executive Office Staff handles implementation. The Grand Chapter may maintain scholarship and expansion committees.

===Grand Council structure===
The Grand Council consists of:
# Grand Sage (President)
# Grand Second Counselor (Vice President)
# Grand Third Counselor (Treasurer)
# Grand Fourth Counselor (Secretary)
# Grand First Counselor (Sergeant at Arms)
# Grand Herald (Historian)
# Past Grand Sage

===Chapter structure===
Chapter governments mirror the Grand Chapter structure, though individual chapter executive councils follow traditional officer duties. Chapters are required to have scholarship, recruitment, pledge education, finance, social, and intramural committees and may have alumni relations, public relations, risk management, and community service committees. Each chapter must have an adviser.

===Executive office ===
The Executive Office, located in Nashville, Tennessee, serves as the fraternity&#x27;s information, service, and record-keeping center. It also houses a small museum. The Executive Office implements policies set by the Grand Chapter and Grand Council. The executive director manages the headquarters, staff, and operations.

Sigma Pi created the Educational Leadership Consultants (ELC) program to advise chapters, later replaced by the Regional Director&#x27;s Program. A new Chapter Management Associate system was implemented.

==Membership==
Sigma Pi, like many social fraternities, limits membership to men only. Requirements can vary by campus, depending on the rules of the university or college and the standards dictated by the campus Interfraternity Council. Generally Sigma Pi requires members to be in good academic standing and be active in the campus community. Potential members meet the brothers of a chapter during a process called rush. Following rush, the chapter convenes and votes on potential new members. With a favorable vote by the entire chapter, a potential new member will be offered a bid to join the local Sigma Pi chapter. If accepted, the man begins his pledgeship. Sigma Pi defines a pledge as &quot;a man who has assented to become a member and who has been elected to membership but has not yet been initiated.&quot;

During this period the pledge and the fraternity come to know each other better and mutually reaffirm the decision to become full members in Sigma Pi. During his pledgeship, a man will learn about the fraternity&#x27;s history, operations, and reasons for existence. He will also learn how his specific chapter operates and what is expected of him as a brother. A pledge has no right to exert influence on chapter policy or organization until he is granted full membership upon initiation; however, a pledge should still participate in conversations about chapter policy and organization with initiated members. Generally the pledge should speak through his big brother or the new member educator. Although not an initiated member, a pledge should not be viewed as less than or unequal to a member. He simply does not know the secrets and rituals of Sigma Pi. His status as a pledge in no way entitles members to treat him any differently than any other member of Sigma Pi.

===Obligations of members===
Sigma Pi demands its members have a reasonable amount of interest and participation in its affairs. Sigma Pi&#x27;s expectations are summarized by its ten obligations. All brothers are expected to regard each obligation with utmost seriousness and strive to work towards their fulfillment. If properly followed, these obligations help make Sigma Pi chapters run effectively and efficiently as well as making Sigma Pi men outstanding members of their communities and society.

# Give proper attention to the interests of Sigma Pi.
# Regard the Fraternity with a spirit of sincerity and respect and give earnest considerations to its teachings and ideals.
# Meet Financial Obligations Promptly And Fully.
# Cheerfully perform tasks that may be assigned for the good of the Fraternity.
# At all times be a gentleman and use moderation in all things.
# Strive at all times to cooperate for the good of the Fraternity.
# Work diligently to maintain good scholarship.
# Participate in worthy college activities.
# Profit by associations with men in a spirit of fraternalism.
# Be an exemplary Sigma Pi and citizen.

===Expectations of membership===
Sigma Pi has several expectations of members to help them gain the most from their membership in Sigma Pi. These expectations are expressed below.

# I will respect the dignity of all persons, and therefore, I will not physically, psychologically, or sexually abuse any human being.
# I will respect the rights of property, both others and my own; therefore I will not, nor will I tolerate, the abuse of private or community property.
# I will pay all of my financial obligations in a timely manner.
# I will not use nor support the use of illegal drugs.
# I will not abuse nor support the abuse of alcohol.
# I acknowledge that a clean and an attractive environment is essential to both physical and mental health; therefore, I will do all in my power to see that the chapter property is properly cleaned and maintained.
# I will confront the members of my Fraternity who are violating the bylaws and policies.

==Philanthropy==
Sigma Pi encourages a fraternal culture that promotes its ideals by philanthropic events for its members and the communities in which its chapters are located. Each chapter is required to complete regular philanthropy events and participate in Sigma Pi&#x27;s Altruistic Campus Experience (ACE). The ACE project is in addition to each chapter&#x27;s normal philanthropy events that it holds throughout the year. Finally, Sigma Pi&#x27;s Educational Fund provides assistance to students to cover the costs of college tuition.

===General philanthropy===
Every two years at the Biennium Convention, Sigma Pi selects a new charity organization as the official philanthropy of Sigma Pi. At times Sigma Pi will select more than one charity. Usually Sigma Pi selects charities created by or for brothers and their families. In doing so Sigma Pi hopes to turn tragedies into rallying points to help promote and encourage a cause that has affected brothers as well as their families.

At this time, Sigma Pi focuses its philanthropic efforts on two organizations for the following two years; the Amazing Day Foundation, and Donate Life America. Furthermore, Sigma Pi requires each individual chapter to sponsor philanthropy events throughout the academic school year. Sigma Pi even encourages chapters to participate in Philanthropy events that occur during school breaks and summers. The fraternity currently allows each individual chapter to assist any charitable causes as they see fit.

===Educational fund===
Beginning in 1947, Honorary Grand Sage Byron R. Lewis (Member of both the &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Phi chapters&quot;) donated several monetary gifts, recommending that the money be used to begin an educational fund. In his name the Byron R. Lewis Educational Fund was established. Its stated goals were to: &quot;supplement the work of colleges in the educational development of students; to assist needy and deserving students to complete their education; and to aid aged or disabled former students who are in need or worthy of assistance.&quot; And in 1992, the fund was renamed the Sigma Pi Educational Foundation. Any Sigma Pi member in good standing may become a member of the Educational Foundation by contributing an annual 100 dollar membership fee or $5,000 in lifetime gifts. As such, in 2000, the Foundation&#x27;s assets were worth more than 2.3 million dollars. The Educational foundation&#x27;s growth supports Sigma Pi members in their continuing quest for education. At the 2012 Convocation in San Antonio, Texas, Sigma Pi unanimously voted to collect 5 dollars per undergraduate member per year specifically designated for the educational foundation.

===Altruistic Campus Experience===
The &quot;ACE&quot; (Altruistic Campus Experience) Project began in the fall of 2002 when Former Executive Director Mark Briscoe re-evaluated the role of Greek life on campus. The project is the first fraternity or sorority campus service program for chapters specifically designed to benefit their host institutions. The program is designed to improve the campuses, on which chapters are located, thereby improving the collegiate experience for the entire college or university. Every project is unique to the individual campuses of each chapter. chapters are asked to determine a campus need and work to fill that need. The university must be aware of and approve the project prior to beginning the project.

== Notable members ==
With more than 100 active chapters and colonies in the United States and Canada, Sigma Pi has over 110,000 alumni. Sigma Pi has alumni who are notable in many different industries and fields.

== Local chapter or member misconduct ==
In March 2012, the Beta chapter at Indiana University released a 10-minute short film titled ‘FRATLINE: The Hazing Barrier’ which was banned by the Inter Fraternity Council and dean of students. Attention was drawn to the film (which was released on YouTube) after it received nearly 30,000 views in a week and depicted a hazing obsessed pledge master named Adam. Despite it being a “mockumentary”, the film was banned for depicting Indiana University Greek Life in a bad light. The film was eventually edited and re-released the following semester. It has been prominently featured on TotalFratMove.com, BroBible.com and the front page of the Indiana Daily Student on Election Day (November 6) of 2012. It currently sits at around 180,000 views on YouTube.

In November 2014, the chapter at Elon University temporarily lost its charter after its national office, as well as Elon officials, were notified about several new members suffering injuries from being forced to lie down on bottle caps. The chapter was a repeat hazing offender. The chapter was eligible to seek reinstatement on campus in fall 2017.

In December 2016, a former chapter of the fraternity made national headlines after disturbing photos leaked of former members hazing at the then-closed Hofstra University chapter. A former pledge and expelled member of the fraternity leaked photos showing individuals who appear to be pledges locked in small cages and photos showing additional individuals who appear to be pledges, shirtless, blindfolded, covered in hot sauce, and kneeling in front of a swastika. On March 1, 2016 - nine months prior to the release of these photos - the Grand Council of Sigma Pi revoked the chapter&#x27;s charter due to &quot;violations of both Fraternity and FIPG risk management policies.&quot;

In October 2016, &quot;Gamma-Sigma chapter&quot; at the University of Missouri opted to withdraw from the university&#x27;s Greek community due to alleged overzealous enforcement of the student code of conduct against members of the chapter. Shortly after the chapter withdrew from the Greek community, the University of Missouri banned Sigma Pi from campus. This rift was caused when a pledge was sent to an emergency room with bruises on his buttocks and a blood alcohol level of 0.34.

In March 2017, the Executive Office of Sigma Pi opted to close its colony at Illinois Wesleyan University after an investigation launched due to a member of the colony being pulled over for drunk driving. The investigation found that the colony may have sponsored an event where underage drinking could have occurred. This was the colony&#x27;s first offense, though a prior iteration of Sigma Pi on this campus faced its own risk management problems. The colony was noted in this case to have a &quot;failure to attend to the culture of risk management.&quot;

In mid-November 2018, a former pledge was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead at an unofficial annex house to Ohio University&#x27;s &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot; of Sigma Pi. The chapter was issued a cease and desist by the school&#x27;s administration and the incident is under investigation by Ohio University and Athens, Ohio police. In April 2019, Ohio University permanently barred Sigma Pi from operating at any of its campuses. Current Sigma Pi members are additionally barred from joining any other social fraternity on campus or creating or colonizing a new fraternity. In February 2019, the estate of the deceased former pledge, Collin Wiant, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Sigma Pi alleging that Wiant and other pledges were hazed. This hazing included being forced to drink a gallon of beer in one hour, and be beaten and humiliated. The suit alleges that this pattern of activity ultimately resulted in Wiant&#x27;s death.

On April 12, 2019, a University at Buffalo chapter caused all Greek life at the university to be suspended along with the creation of a new internal review committee for Greek Life following potential hazing. The student, Sebastian Serafin-Bazan, died five days later. The investigation is ongoing as of April 17, 2019.

In 2021, the chapter at the University of Indiana was suspended for at least two years for hazing pledges, endangering others, dishonest conduct, and failure to comply with university regulations.

<text>The second USS &quot;Ontario&quot; was a three-masted, wooden-hulled sloop of war in the United States Navy, bearing 16 guns, and saw service during and following the years of the War of 1812 and in the Second Barbary War. &quot;Ontario&quot; was built by Thomas Kemp, Baltimore, Maryland, in 1813; blockaded in Chesapeake Bay through the War of 1812; and sailed from New York for the Mediterranean on 20 May 1815, Master Commandant Jesse D. Elliott in command. 
==Second Barbary War==
&quot;Ontario&quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 15 June 1815 and joined Commodore Stephen Decatur&#x27;s ten ship squadron sent there to put a stop to the piracy of the Barbary states of Tripoli and Algiers that had plagued the Mediterranean for many years. Present in the fleet was the frigates and and sloop , the latter being used to sail home with the signed treaty. &quot;Ontario&quot; then began serving in the blockade off Algiers and continued through June when the Dey of Algiers finally and reluctantly agreed to sign a peace with Decatur. The sloop along with the squadron then sailed to Tripoli and Tunis to demand indemnities for pirated prizes and continued operating in protection of American shipping interests until departing for home, arriving at New York in early 1817.

==Pacific==
On 4 October the &quot;Ontario&quot;, under the command of Captain James Biddle sailed to the Pacific station on a pioneer mission, stopping at Rio de Janeiro, to deliver dispatches. The sloop then sailed around Cape Horn and proceeded to Valparaíso, Chile, in early 1818. The Chilean War of Independence at this time was in full swing and a Spanish blockade of Valparaíso had been declared, with American merchantmen ships being seized. Through diplomatic negotiations with authorities at that port, Captain Biddle succeeded in achieving the release of captured U.S. ships, and then departed north, arriving off Cape Disappointment on the Columbia River on 19 August. There the ship claimed both sides of the river for the United States and next sailed south, touching at Monterey, California, for supplies, becoming the first American naval vessel to visit the three future Pacific coast states. &quot;Ontario&quot; sailed for home that fall, stopping at Valparaíso en route in time to witness the start of Lord Cochrane&#x27;s campaign at sea against Spain, and stood into Chesapeake Bay finally on 23 April 1819.

==Mediterranean Squadron==
On 18 January 1821, &quot;Ontario&quot; departed New York Harbor on her next voyage, sailing for the Mediterranean Sea after stopping at the West Indies. She arrived at Gibraltar, joining Commodore William Bainbridge&#x27;s squadron on 4 June and stayed in those waters for over two and one-half years. The ship returned to New York on 25 January 1824, and following a six months refitting sailed for a second extended deployment with the Mediterranean Squadron on 24 July. &quot;Ontario&quot; returned home on 20 February 1828 and then made two more trips to the Mediterranean from August 1829 to May 1832 and November 1833 to June 1836. 
==West Indies and Home Squadrons==
She next sailed for the West Indies on 19 August 1837 and operated on station there, until it was merged with the Home Squadron in 1838, through the spring of 1840. The warship spent most of her time protecting U.S. commerce from pirate attacks, showing the flag in Caribbean ports, and operating out of Havana and Pensacola protecting American neutrality during French intervention in Mexico until returning to New York on 2 June.

On her final mission &quot;Ontario&quot; departed for New Orleans beginning her last distant station cruise on 22 February 1842, protecting American shipping and other interests, She then set sail for Norfolk and then finally Baltimore on 30 July 1843, where the ship began duty as a Navy Yard receiving ship and remained there in service until June 1856. After her service to the United States the &quot;Ontario&quot; was sold at public auction on 15 July.

<text>Leganes, officially the Municipality of Leganes (, ), is a municipality in the province of Iloilo, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 34,725 people.

It is located north of the capital Iloilo City. Like most Philippine towns that sprawl outward from the capital, is made up of houses, farms and light agricultural industry. The major thoroughfare runs right through the center of the town.

Leganes is a part of the Metro Iloilo–Guimaras area, centered on Iloilo City.

==History==
Leganes has a history closely intertwined with the neighboring town of Jaro. For many centuries, Leganes was considered an unremarkable area, primarily consisting of wetlands, marshes, and swamps. The upper part of the region was inhabited by wild animals, and it was known as Guihaman.

In 1903, through Act No. 719, Leganes was incorporated into the municipality of Santa Barbara. However, this arrangement was short-lived. In 1915, by virtue of Executive Order No. 97, Leganes was removed from Santa Barbara and merged with Jaro, effective from January 1, 1916.

Further changes occurred in 1939 when Executive Order No. 241 was issued on December 23. This order separated the &quot;arrabal de Leganes&quot; from the municipality of Jaro, establishing it as an independent municipality. This change officially took effect on January 1, 1940, marking the formation of the municipality of Leganes.

Leganes has now been designated as one of the locations for light industries in the province. Restia Agro-Industrial Estate Park in Barangay Calabao, is the province&#x27;s first agro-industrial economic zone, accredited by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA).

==Geography==
===Barangays===
Leganes is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

<doc id="1195075" wikidata="Q7961059" url="?curid=1195075" title="Wakefield line">
<text>The Wakefield line is a railway line and service in the West Yorkshire Metro and South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive areas of northern England. The Wakefield line is coloured yellow on maps and publications by West Yorkshire Metro. The line was electrified in 1989, between Leeds &amp; Wakefield Westgate, as part of the programme to electrify the East Coast Main Line.

The service connects Leeds and Wakefield with Sheffield and Doncaster with the section of the line between Leeds and Doncaster forming part of the East Coast Main Line. The local stopping service is operated by Northern with services between Leeds, Wakefield and either Doncaster or Sheffield. Inter-city operators are London North Eastern Railway, East Midlands Railway and CrossCountry who provide services from Leeds to London and the South of England.

Some sections of the line are shared with the Huddersfield (orange) and Pontefract lines (light blue).

West Yorkshire &quot;Metrocards&quot; are available for all trains as far as on the Doncaster section of the line and to on the Sheffield section.

==Pre-nationalisation ownership==
At the time of the 1923 Grouping the line was owned by different railway companies:
* Leeds Central–Wakefield 
Great Northern Railway (GNR) – with station being jointly owned by the GNR and Great Central Railways (GCR).
* Wakefield–Doncaster 
West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway (WRGJt) itself being of joint Great Northern Railway and Great Central Railway ownership.
* Moorthorpe–Swinton
Swinton &amp; Knottingley Joint Railway itself being of joint Midland Railway (MidR) and North Eastern Railway (NER) ownership.
* Swinton–Sheffield 
Midland Railway (MidR)

==The route==
Trains on the line serve the following places; however, some stations have closed:

===Leeds City–Fitzwilliam===

* (closed)

&quot;Ardsley Tunnel&quot;
* (closed)
* (formerly known as Lofthouse and Outwood)

At Outwood there were junctions with two joint undertakings; East &amp; West Yorkshire Union (a short line connecting the Great Northern / Midland Railway main lines via Rothwell and Methley Joint Railway (owners being Great Northern, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and North Eastern Railway) connecting to various lines in the Castleford area.

&quot;Wrenthorpe Junction&quot;

From this junction was a line to Dewsbury which was partially closed in 1963 and complete closure came in 1965 – some artefacts still remain to this day.
* (originally &#x27;Sandal&#x27;, closed 1957; reopened 1987 by British Rail with new name)
* (closed) 
&quot;Nostell North &amp; South Junctions with Great Central Railway&quot;
* Nostell (closed) 
* (replaced an earlier station of the same name a short distance away)
* Hemsworth (closed)
&quot;Junction with the Hull and Barnsley Railway (HBR)&quot;

&quot;Junction with Sheffield branch to the south&quot;

===Fitzwilliam–Doncaster===
* South Elmsall
* (closed)
* Adwick (originally &#x27;Carcroft &amp; Adwick-le-Street&#x27; station, closed 1967; reopened by British Rail a short distance away with new name in 1993)
* 

===Fitzwilliam–Swinton===
Part of this section is also worked as the Dearne Valley line:
* (closed)
&quot;Branch line to Frickley Colliery&quot;
&quot;Hickleton Junction for the Dearne Valley Railway&quot; &quot;(worked by the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway)&quot;
* 
&quot;Junction with the Great Central Railway Penistone–Doncaster line.&quot;

===Swinton–Sheffield===
From Swinton towards Sheffield, the Midland Railway and Great Central had parallel lines following the course of the River Don. The lines of the competing companies were so close that in 1965 British Railways built a new junction complex at Aldwarke and the current Wakefield Line now follows the former Great Central line to reach the reopened . Intermediate stations were to be found at:
* (closed)
* (closed)
&quot;Taking a new curve, the line joins the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway.&quot;
* Meadowhall(opened 1990; replaced which closed in 1956 which was on same site)
* (closed)
&quot;Grimesthorpe Junction the line leaves the Sheffield &amp; Rotherham and takes the Midland Railway line built in 1870. &quot;
* (closed)

<doc id="1195086" wikidata="Q3112961" url="?curid=1195086" title="Percy Ludgate">
<text>Percy Edwin Ludgate (2 August 1883 – 16 October 1922) was an Irish amateur scientist who designed the second analytical engine (general-purpose Turing-complete computer) in history.

== Life ==
Ludgate was born on 2 August 1883 in Skibbereen, County Cork, to Michael Ludgate and Mary McMahon. In the 1901 census, he is listed as Civil Servant National Education (Boy Copyist) in Dublin. In the 1911 census, he is also in Dublin, as a Commercial Clerk (Corn Merchant). He studied accountancy at Rathmines College of Commerce, earning a gold medal based on the results of his final examinations in 1917. At some date before or after then, he joined Kevans &amp; Son, accountants.

== Work on analytical engine ==
It seems that Ludgate worked as a clerk for an unknown corn merchant, in Dublin, and pursued his interest in calculating machines at night. Charles Babbage in 1843 and Ludgate in 1909 designed the only two mechanical analytical engines before the electromechanical analytical engine of Leonardo Torres Quevedo of 1920 and its few successors, and the six first-generation electronic analytical engines of 1949.

Working alone, Ludgate designed an analytical engine while unaware of Babbage&#x27;s designs, although he later went on to write about Babbage&#x27;s machine. Ludgate&#x27;s engine used multiplication as its base mechanism (unlike Babbage&#x27;s which used addition). It incorporated the first multiplier-accumulator, and was the first to exploit a multiplier-accumulator to perform division, using multiplication seeded by reciprocal, via the convergent series .

Ludgate&#x27;s engine also used a mechanism similar to slide rules, but employing unique, discrete &quot;Logarithmic Indexes&quot; (now known as Irish logarithms), as well as a novel memory system utilizing concentric cylinders, storing numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles. His design featured several other novel features, including for program control (e.g., preemption and subroutines – or microcode, depending on one&#x27;s viewpoint). The design is so dissimilar from Babbage&#x27;s that it can be considered a second, unique type of analytical engine, which thus preceded the third (electromechanical) and fourth (electronic) types. The engine&#x27;s precise mechanism is unknown, as the only written accounts which survive do not detail its workings, although he stated in 1914 that &quot;[c]omplete descriptive drawings of the machine exist, as well as a description in manuscript&quot; – these have never been found.

Ludgate was one of just a few independent workers in the field of science and mathematics. His inventions were worked on outside a lab. He worked on them only part-time, often until the early hours of the morning. Many publications refer to him as an accountant, but that came only after his 1909 analytical engine paper. Little is known about his personal life, as his only known records are his scientific writings. Prior to 2016, the best source of information about Ludgate and his significance was in the work of Professor Brian Randell. Since then, further investigation is underway at Trinity College, Dublin under the auspices of the John Gabriel Byrne Computer Science Collection.

Ludgate died of pneumonia on 19 October 1922, and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin.

==Legacy==
In 1960, a German patent lawyer working on behalf of IBM successfully relied on Ludgate’s 1909 paper to defeat an important 1941 patent application by the pioneering computer scientist Konrad Zuse. Had the patent been approved, Zuse would have controlled the primary intellectual property for crucial techniques that all computers now use; this would have changed his career and could well have altered the commercial trajectory of the computer industry.
In 1991, a prize for the best final-year project in the Moderatorship in computer science course at Trinity College, Dublin – the Ludgate Prize – was instituted in his honour, and in 2016 the Ludgate Hub e-business incubation centre was opened in Skibbereen, where he was born.

In October 2022, a plaque from the National Committee for Commemorative Plaques in Science and Technology was unveiled at Ludgate&#x27;s home in Drumcondra by the Provost of Trinity College, Linda Doyle. (As can be seen in the photo, the year of birth is listed incorrectly on the plaque.)

Also in 2022, a podcast with Dr Chris Horn discussed Percy Ludgate, then in October 2024 an appealing and accurate podcast on Percy Ludgate was created by Google&#x27;s Gemini A.I..

<text>The giant Gippsland earthworm (Megascolides australis) is one of Australia&#x27;s 1,000 native earthworm species.

==Description==
These giant earthworms average long and in diameter and can reach in length; however, their body is able to expand and contract making them appear much larger. On average they weigh about . They have a dark purple head and a blue-grey body, and about 300 to 400 body segments.

==Ecology==
They live in the subsoil of blue, grey or red clay soils along stream banks and some south- or west-facing hills of their remaining habitat which is in Gippsland in Victoria, Australia. These worms live in deep burrow systems and require water in their environment to respire. They have relatively long life spans for invertebrates and can take 5 years to reach maturity. The reproductive period of the Giant Gippsland Earthworm mainly spans from September to December. They breed in the warmer months and produce egg capsules that are to in length which are laid in their burrows. When these worms hatch in 12 months they are around long at birth.

Unlike most earthworms which deposit castings on the surface, they spend almost all their time in burrows about in depth and deposit their castings there, and can generally only be flushed out by heavy rain. They eat organic matter as well as bacteria and fungi, which may have allowed them to better adapt to the change from a forest to pasture living area. They are usually very sluggish, but when they move rapidly through their burrows, it can cause an audible gurgling or sucking sound which allows them to be detected.

==Threatened status==
Gippsland earthworm colonies are small and isolated, and the species&#x27; low reproductive rates and slow maturation make those small populations vulnerable. Their natural habitats are grasslands, and while they can survive beneath pastures, cultivation, heavy cattle grazing and effluent run-off are adversarial to the species. The Gippsland earthworm requires moist loamy soil to thrive; dense tree planting negatively affects soil humidity, which in turn negatively affects the species&#x27; habitat. No successful breeding has yet been achieved in captivity.

==Education==
Until it closed in 2012 amid animal welfare concerns, Wildlife Wonderland Park near Bass, Victoria, was home to the Giant Earthworm Museum. Inside the worm-shaped museum, visitors could crawl through a magnified replica of a worm burrow and a simulated worm&#x27;s stomach. Displays and educational material on the giant Gippsland earthworm and other natural history of Gippsland were also featured.

==Tourism==
Interest in the giant Gippsland earthworm has been exploited by the local tourist industry with an annual Karmai Festival in Korumburra. In the Boonwurrung language it is said to have been called &quot;karmai&quot;.

<doc id="1195101" wikidata="Q65122143" url="?curid=1195101" title="Beaver Field">
<text>Beaver Field (1892–1908), was the first official home to the Penn State football and baseball teams. Retroactively known as &quot;Old Beaver Field&quot;, it had a capacity of 500 and stood between present-day Osmond and Frear Laboratories, now the site of a parking lot.

== History ==

Until the construction of Beaver Field, sports teams of the then Pennsylvania State College, known as the Nittany Lions, played on the Old Main Lawn, a grassy area outside the main classroom building. Beaver Field served as the first official home for the football and baseball teams.

The football team moved in 1909 to New Beaver Field, which held 30,000 fans and served as Penn State&#x27;s home stadium until 1959, when it was disassembled and moved to the current location of Beaver Stadium in 1960. After the move to New Beaver Field, the original field became known as Old Beaver Field.

The field had a grandstand that seated 500. This took the form of a hip-roofed building with no side walls, supported by rows of six columns at the front and rear plus one on each side. A gable at the front bore the name &quot;Beaver Field&quot;, below it the year, 1893, and &quot;P.S.C.&quot;

Beaver Field was named in June 1892 for James A. Beaver, who was governor of Pennsylvania from 1887 to 1891. Although the state did not usually fund athletics in its public colleges, leaving that to student fees and alumni gifts, Beaver had a line added to the legislative appropriation for Pennsylvania State College that provided $2,000 in 1891–92 and $1,000 in 1893–94 for improving its athletic grounds. These funds made it possible to lay out a quarter-mile track enclosing baseball and football grounds, tennis courts, and a grandstand. The field opened on November 6, 1893, after a two-day weather delay, with a game against Western University of Pittsburgh that Penn State won 32–0.

Beaver Field began as a plot of grass on Penn State&#x27;s campus located in the academic village. The land was designated for athletics by faculty in 1875 with growing demand for sport. By 1890 the grass field had a dirt running track, a baseball diamond and a football field and a set of covered wooden bleachers with a seating capacity of 100.

Calls from students pushed the university to begin exploring its options to expand its athletic facilities. Then university president James A. Beaver was able to use his political influence as the former Governor of Pennsylvania to push Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislature to appropriate funds to build a proper athletics facility.

Penn State received $2,000 () in 1891, and an additional $1,000 () in 1893 to help construct Beaver Field, a stadium with a grandstand, football field, and quarter mile track.

<doc id="1195103" wikidata="Q317131" url="?curid=1195103" title="Vincent Ferrer">
<text>Vincent Ferrer, OP ( ; ; ; ; ; ; 23 January 1350 – 5 April 1419) was a Valencian Dominican friar and preacher, who gained acclaim as a missionary and a logician. He is honored as a saint of the Catholic Church and other churches of Catholic traditions.

==Early life==
Vincent was the fourth child of Guillem Ferrer, a notary from Palamós, and his wife, Constança Miquel, apparently from Valencia itself or Girona.

Legends surround Vincent&#x27;s birth. It was said that his father was told in a dream by a Dominican friar that his son would be famous throughout the world. His mother is said never to have experienced pain when she gave birth to him. He was named after Vincent Martyr, the patron saint of Valencia. He would fast on Wednesdays and Fridays and distribute alms to the poor. He began his classical studies at the age of eight, and his study of theology and philosophy at fourteen. Four years later, at the age of eighteen, Ferrer entered the Order of Preachers, commonly called the Dominican Order (in England also known as &quot;Black Friars&quot; because of the black cloak they wear over their white habits). As soon as he had entered the novitiate of the Order, though, he experienced temptations urging him to leave. Even his parents pleaded with him to do so and become a secular priest. He prayed and practiced penance to overcome these trials. Thus he succeeded in completing the year of probation and advancing to his profession.

For a period of three years, he read solely Sacred Scripture and eventually committed it to memory. He published a treatise on Dialectic Suppositions after his solemn profession, and in 1379 was ordained a Catholic priest at Barcelona. He eventually became a Master of Sacred Theology and was commissioned by the Order to deliver lectures on philosophy. He was then sent to Barcelona and eventually to the University of Lleida, where he earned his doctorate in theology.

Vincent Ferrer is described as a man of medium height, with a lofty forehead and very distinct features. His hair was fair in color and tonsured. His eyes were very dark and expressive; his manner gentle. Pale was his ordinary color. His voice was strong and powerful, at times gentle, resonant, and vibrant.

==Western Schism==
The Western Schism (1378–1417) divided Catholicism between two, then eventually three, claimants to the papacy. Antipope Clement VII lived at Avignon in France, and Pope Urban VI in Rome. Vincent was convinced that the election of Urban was invalid, although Catherine of Siena was just as devoted a supporter of the Roman pope. In the service of Cardinal Pedro de Luna, Vincent worked to persuade Spaniards to follow Clement. When Clement died in 1394, Cardinal de Luna was elected as the second antipope successor to the Avignon papacy and took the name Benedict XIII.

Vincent and his brother Boniface, General of the Carthusians, were loyal to Benedict XIII, commonly known as &quot;Papa Luna&quot; in Castile and Aragon. He worked for Benedict XIII as apostolic penitentiary and Master of the Sacred Palace. Nonetheless Vincent labored to have Benedict XIII end the schism. When Benedict XIII did not resign as intended at either the Council of Pisa (1409) or the Council of Constance (1414–1418), he lost the support of the French king and of most of his cardinals, and was excommunicated as a schismatic in 1417.

Vincent later claimed that the Western Schism had had such a depressing effect on his mind that it caused him to be seriously ill.

==Religious gifts and missionary work==
For twenty-one years he was said to have traveled to England, Scotland, Ireland, Aragon, Castile, France, Switzerland, and Italy, preaching the Gospel and converting many. Many biographers believe that he could speak only Valencian, but was endowed with the gift of tongues. He was a noted preacher. Though he himself was an intellectual, his preaching style has been described as &quot;innovative in that it incorporated a popular tone and rhetorical directness into the (by then traditional) Scholastic, thematic sermon structure&quot;.

He preached to Colette of Corbie and her nuns, and it was she who told him that he would die in France. Too ill to return to Spain, he did, indeed, die in Brittany in 1419. Breton fishermen still invoke his aid in storms, and in Spain he is the patron of orphanages.

==Conversion of Jews and controversy==
Vincent is said to have been responsible for the conversion of many Jews to Catholicism, allegedly by questionable means according to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;; for instance, he is said to have strongly encouraged conversion and to have consecrated synagogues as churches. A contemporary convert, a former rabbi by the name of Solomon ha-Levi, went on to become the Bishop of Cartagena and later the Archbishop of Burgos. Vincent is alleged to have contributed to anti-Semitism in Spain, as commotion accompanied his visits to towns that had Jewish communities.

Because of the Spanish&#x27;s methods of converting Jews at the time, the means which Vincent had at his disposal were either baptism or spoliation. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, he won them over by his preaching, converting an estimated 25,000 Jews.

Sources are contradictory concerning Vincent&#x27;s achievement in converting a synagogue in Toledo, Spain, into the Church of Santa María la Blanca. One source says he preached to the mobs whose riots led to the appropriation of the synagogue and its transformation into a church in 1391; a second source says he converted the Jews of the city who then changed the synagogue to a church after they embraced the Faith, but hints at the year 1411. A third source identifies two distinct incidents, one in Valencia in 1391 and one in Toledo at a later date, but says that Vincent put down an uprising against Jews in one place and defused a persecution against them in the other. Vincent also attended the Disputation of Tortosa (1413–14), called by Avignon Pope Benedict XIII in an effort to convert Jews to Catholicism after a debate among scholars of both religions.

==Compromise of Caspe==
Vincent participated in the management of a significant political crisis in his homeland. King Martin of Aragon died in 1410 without a legitimate heir, and five potential candidates came forth to claim the throne, all with royal bloodlines. It was determined that a committee of nine respected figures, three each from Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia (the realms comprising the Crown of Aragon), would review the qualifications and select the next king. Vincent was chosen as one of the representatives of Valencia, and he voted for the Castilian prince Ferdinand of Antequera, who became the next King of Aragon. On 28 June, Ferrer publicly proclaimed Ferdinand of Castile as king of Aragon. The process by which Ferdinand was determined to be the next king is known as the Compromise of Caspe.

==Death and legacy==
Vincent died on 5 April 1419 at Vannes in Brittany, at the age of 69, and was buried in Vannes Cathedral. He was canonized by Pope Callixtus III on 3 June 1455. His feast day is celebrated on 5 April.

Entities named after him include a pontifical religious institute, the Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer, and two Brazilian municipalities, São Vicente Ferrer, Maranhão, and São Vicente Ferrer, Pernambuco.

A 50-metre (164-foot) statue of Ferrer was erected in Bayambang, Philippines, in 2019.

<text>The Organisation for National Reconstruction (ONR) was a political party in Trinidad and Tobago. The party received the second-highest number of votes in the 1981 general elections, but failed to win a seat. Prior to the 1986 elections it merged into the new National Alliance for Reconstruction.

==History==
The party was founded by Karl Hudson-Phillips, who had resigned from the ruling People&#x27;s National Movement in 1973 when Prime Minister Eric Williams reversed his decision to resign from politics. Hudson-Phillips had been the main contender to succeed Williams - once Williams returned there was no longer room for a person who had openly expressed an interest in leading the party. Hudson-Phillips went on to form the &quot;&#x27;National Land Tenants and Ratepayers Association of Trinidad and Tobago&quot; in 1974, a right-of-centre body. After building a support base among the middle and upper classes, he launched the ONR in 1980. Despite receiving 22.2% of the vote, the party failed to win any seats, whilst the United Labour Front (which had received 15.2% of the vote) won ten seats.

This setback led to the ONR forging a closer relationship with the other opposition parties, which had organised themselves as the National Alliance prior to the elections. In the 1983 local elections the ONR won 26 of the 120 local government seats, while the National Alliance won 40. This was the first time since 1959 that the PNM had not won the majority of seats contested in any election in Trinidad (the DAC had taken control of the Tobago House of Assembly in 1980). Following on this success, the three parties making up the National Alliance and the ONR merged to form a single party, the National Alliance for Reconstruction. In the 1986 general elections the NAR won 33 of the 36 seats in Parliament and was able to form the new government.

Hudson-Phillips did not take a major role in the NAR government (according to Basdeo Panday this was because of animosity between Hudson-Phillips and A. N. R. Robinson, the &quot;compromise&quot; leader of the NAR). However, several other ONR members held prominent posts in the NAR government. After the NAR folded, many former ONR members joined the United National Congress, while others returned to the PNM.

<text>A proleg is a small, fleshy, stub structure found on the ventral surface of the abdomen of most larval forms of insects of the order Lepidoptera, though they can also be found on larvae of insects such as sawflies. In all the orders in which they appear, mainly Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera, prolegs of any form evolved independently of each other by convergent evolution. They appear to have evolved from ancient inactive genes that have since been activated again.

Prolegs of lepidopteran larvae have a small circle of gripping hooks, called &quot;crochets&quot;. The arrangement of the crochets can be helpful in identification to family level. Although the point has been debated, prolegs are not widely regarded as true legs, derived from the primitive uniramous limbs. Certainly in their morphology they are not jointed, and so lack the five segments (coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus) of thoracic insect legs. Prolegs do have limited musculature, but much of their movement is hydraulically powered.

<doc id="1195115" wikidata="Q2578228" url="?curid=1195115" title="Frazil ice">
<text>Frazil ice is a collection of loose, randomly oriented ice crystals a millimeter and sub-millimeter in size, with various shapes, e.g., elliptical disks, dendrites, needles and of an irregular nature. Frazil ice forms during the winter in open-water reaches of rivers as well as in lakes and reservoirs, where and when the water is in a turbulent state, which is, in turn, induced by the action of waves and currents. Turbulence causes the water column to become supercooled, as the heat exchange between the air and the water is such that the water temperature drops below its freezing point (in order of a few tenths of  °C or less). The vertical mixing associated with that turbulence provides enough energy to overcome the crystals&#x27; buoyancy, thus keeping them from floating at the surface. Frazil ice also forms in oceans, where windy conditions, wave regimes and cold air also favor the establishment of a supercooled layer. Frazil ice can be found on the downwind side of leads and in polynyas. In these environments, that ice can eventually accumulate at the water surface into what is referred to as grease ice. 

Frazil ice is notorious for blocking water intakes, as crystals accumulate and build up on the intake trash rack. Such blockages negatively impact water supply facilities, hydropower plants, nuclear power facilities, and vessels navigating in cold waters, and can lead to unexpected shutdowns of the facility or even collapse of the trash rack.

== Formation ==
When the water surface begins to lose heat rapidly, the water becomes supercooled. Turbulence, caused by strong winds or flow from a river, will mix the supercooled water throughout its entire depth. The supercooled water will already be encouraging the formation of small ice crystals (frazil ice) and the crystals get taken to the bottom of the water body. Ice generally floats, but due to frazil ice&#x27;s small size relative to current speeds, it has an ineffective buoyancy and can be carried to the bottom very easily.

Through a process called secondary nucleation, the crystals quickly increase in number, and because of its supercooled surrounding, the crystals will continue to grow. Sometimes, the concentration is estimated to reach one million ice crystals per cubic meter.

As the crystals grow in number and size, the frazil ice will begin to adhere to objects in the water, especially if the objects themselves are at a temperature below water&#x27;s freezing point. The accumulation of frazil ice often causes flooding or damage to objects such as trash racks. Since frazil ice is found below the surface of water, it is difficult to detect its formation.

Usually, the frazil ice accumulates on the upstream side of objects and sticks to them. As more frazil is deposited, the growth will extend upstream and increase in width until the point where the frazil ice accumulations bridge together and block the water. As more and more water flows against this block, the pressure on the upstream side increases and causes a differential pressure (difference in pressure from the upstream side and the downstream side). This will cause the growth of the bridge to extend downstream. Once this happens, flooding and damage is likely unless otherwise prevented.

Frazil ice has also been demonstrated to form beneath temperate (or &quot;warm-based&quot;) glaciers as water flows quickly downhill and supercools due to a rapid loss of pressure. This &quot;glaciohydraulic supercooling&quot; process forms an open network of platy ice crystals that can effectively trap silt from the sediment-laden water that flows beneath glaciers and ice sheets. Subsequent freezing and recrystallization can result in a layer of sediment-rich ice at the base of the glacier which, upon melting at the terminus, can result in significant accumulation of sediment in moraines. This phenomenon has been verified by elevated concentrations of tritium — produced by nuclear weapons testing and therefore almost entirely absent in ice frozen before 1945 — in the basal ice of several glaciers (signifying young ice) and the observation of rapid growth of ice crystals around water discharge vents at glacier termini.

==Control==
There are several ways to control frazil ice build up. They include suppression, mechanical control, thermal control, vibration, materials selection and damage mitigation.

===Suppression===
Frazil ice forms in supercooled water which occurs because the surface water loses heat to cooler air above. Suppression is the idea of insulating the surface water with an intact, stable ice cover. The ice cover will prevent heat loss and warm the supercooled water that might have already formed. Sufficient area needs to be covered in order for this method to work, but it is still unknown what is meant by &quot;sufficient&quot;. The St. Lawrence River is explicitly managed to create &quot;flow conditions that help form a stable ice cover&quot; to prevent frazil ice and subsequent ice jams.

===Mechanical control===
These methods include stabilizing freeze without restricting water flow, such as implementing weirs and ice booms, installing water jets to break up any accumulation that might occur, and using manual labour to rake away the accumulation. This final method is often not preferred because of high labour costs, cold, wet and late night working conditions. Back flushing is another technology that uses the idea of cancelling out the differential pressure caused by the frazil ice accumulation. This technology creates a high pressure on the downstream side of objects to reverse the differential pressure.

===Thermal control===
These methods either heat the structures in the water to prevent frazil ice adhesion or heat the water to prevent frazil ice from forming in the first place. When heating the structure, it must be heated to a temperature above freezing. Electrical resistance heaters have been found to work well, but these have potential safety problems. Installing hollow tubes in the structures through which steam or warm water is pumped also works, but this method has been judged as uneconomical to operate. Other active methods are also available. Certain industrial processes, for example power production, draw water supplies for plant-cooling purposes. The warmed water byproducts thus produced, otherwise discharged as waste, can be released at locations of potential frazil accumulation, raising the water temperature by , often enough to prevent supercooled water from developing. Alternatively, the waste water may instead be recirculated to directly warm surfaces prone to frazil ice accumulation. Both these methods of warm water re-use require precise calculation of volumes, flow and placement, and relative water temperatures, in order to be reliable.

===Vibration===
Although still in the experimental stages, blasting with dynamite is one form of vibrational control that will break loose any frazil ice accumulation. The charge must be precise such that the ice breaks, but surrounding structures and environment are not harmed. Safety of the blasting also is important and nearby residents might complain about sound pollution. For all these reasons, this method is not often used, except as an emergency last resort.

===Materials selection===
Man-made structures are often the objects to which frazil ice adheres. As such, the choice of materials for these structures should include consideration of ice adhesion. Steel structures, for example will rust, and rust-to-ice adhesion is very strong. Choosing a material with lower adhesion such as plastic, fiberglass, graphite or even an epoxy paint coating on the steel will reduce the adhesion probability. Although adhesion will still occur, using such materials makes other methods, such as raking, easier.

===Damage mitigation===
Damage could be reduced by protecting designated flood regions with mechanical structures.

<text>Eric Robert Walters, (born March 3, 1957) is a Canadian author of young adult fiction and picture books. As of 2020, Eric Walters has written over 100 books.

==Background==
Walters was an elementary school teacher at Vista Heights Public School in Streetsville, Ontario. In 1993, he was teaching a grade 5 class in which many of the students were reluctant readers and writers. To encourage them, Walters wrote his first novel, &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot;. The novel was set in the school and included features from the community and the names of many of his students. He has since written more than 70 novels for young adults.
He is a three-time winner of both the Ontario Library Association Silver Birch and Red Maple Awards – voted on by over 100,000 students throughout the province of Ontario. His books have been translated and published in many countries.

==Personal life==
Eric Walters was born and raised in Toronto and resides in Guelph, Ontario, with his wife Anita. They have three adult children, Christina, Nick and Julia.

Walters tries to experience the subjects he plans to write about. In April 2010 he walked across the Sahara before writing &quot;Just Deserts&quot;. With his son, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for &quot;Between Heaven and Earth&quot;. He played with tigers before writing &quot;Tiger by the Tail&quot;.

In addition, Walters founded the Creation of Hope, an organization providing care for orphans in the Mbooni district of Kenya. Presently more than 400 orphans are being provided with services that include food, school fees, uniforms, tools, beds, livestock, and the construction of two children&#x27;s residences in the town of Kikima.

<doc id="1195124" wikidata="Q1366657" url="?curid=1195124" title="Velella">
<text>Velella is a monospecific genus of hydrozoa in the Porpitidae family. Its only known species is Velella velella, a cosmopolitan (widely distributed) free-floating hydrozoan that lives on the surface of the open ocean. It is commonly known by the names sea raft, by-the-wind sailor, purple sail, little sail, or simply &quot;Velella&quot;.

This small cnidarian is part of a specialised ocean surface community that includes the better-known cnidarian siphonophore, the Portuguese man o&#x27; war. Specialized predatory gastropod molluscs prey on these cnidarians. Such predators include nudibranchs (sea slugs) in the genus &quot;Glaucus&quot; and purple snails in the genus &quot;Janthina&quot;.

Each apparent individual is a hydroid colony, and most are less than about 7 cm long. They are usually deep blue in colour, but their most obvious feature is a small stiff sail that catches the wind and propels them over the surface of the sea. Under certain wind conditions, they may be stranded by the thousand on beaches.

Like other cnidarians, &quot;Velella velella&quot; are carnivorous. They catch their prey, generally plankton, by means of tentacles that hang down in the water and bear cnidocysts (also called nematocysts). The toxins in their nematocysts are effective against their prey. While cnidarians all possess nematocysts, in some species the nematocysts and toxins therein are more powerful than other species. &quot;V. velella&quot;&#x27;s nematocysts are relatively benign to humans, although each person may respond differently to contact with the nematocyst toxin. It is wise to avoid touching one&#x27;s face or eyes after handling &quot;V. velella&quot;, and itching may develop on parts of the skin that have been exposed to &quot;V. velella&quot; nematocysts.


==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Velella velella&quot; lives in warm and temperate waters in all the world&#x27;s oceans. They live at the water/air interface, with the float above the water, and polyps hanging down about a centimetre below. Organisms that live partly in and partly out of the water like this are known as neuston. Offshore boaters sometimes encounter thousands of &quot;V. velella&quot; on the water surface.

The small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind. However, &quot;Velella&quot; sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil, so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind. Having no means of locomotion other than its sail, &quot;V. velella&quot; is at the mercy of prevailing winds for moving around the seas, and are thereby also subject to mass-strandings on beaches throughout the world. For example, a mass stranding occurs most years in the spring along the West Coast of North America, from British Columbia to California, beginning in the north and moving south over several weeks&#x27; time. In some years, so many animals are left at the tide line by receding waves, that the line of dying (and subsequently rotting) animals may be many centimetres deep, along hundreds of kilometres of beaches. Mass strandings have been reported also on the west coast of Ireland, and in Hayle, on the west coast of Cornwall in England.

==Life cycle==
Like many Hydrozoa, &quot;Velella velella&quot; has a bipartite life cycle, with a form of alternation of generations. The deep blue, by-the-wind sailors that are recognized by many beach-goers are the polyp phase of the life cycle. Each &quot;individual&quot; with its sail is really a hydroid colony, with many polyps that feed on ocean plankton. These are connected by a canal system that enables the colony to share whatever food is ingested by individual polyps. Each by-the-wind sailor is a colony of all-male or all-female polyps. The colony has several different kinds of polyps, some of which are both feeding and reproductive, called gonozooids, and others protective, called dactylozooids.

The gonozooids each produce numerous tiny jellyfish by an asexual budding process, so that each Velella colony produces thousands of tiny jellyfish (medusae), each about 1 mm high and wide, over several weeks. The tiny medusae are each provided with many zooxanthellae, single-celled endosymbiotic organisms typically also found in corals and some sea anemones, that can utilize sunlight to provide energy to the jellyfish. Curiously, although a healthy captive &quot;Velella&quot; will release many medusae under the microscope, and are expected to do the same in the sea, the medusae of &quot;Velella&quot; are rarely captured in the plankton and very little is known about their natural history. The medusae develop to sexual maturity within about three weeks in the laboratory and their free-spawned eggs and sperm develop into a planktonic larva called a conaria, which develops into a new floating &quot;Velella&quot; hydroid colony.

==Systematics==

The Porpitidae is a family of the Hydrozoa erected for two genera of hydroids that live floating free at the surface of the open ocean: &quot;Velella&quot; and &quot;Porpita&quot;. The systematic position of these peculiar genera has long been a topic of discussion among taxonomists who work with pelagic Cnidaria. The three genera were put in with athecate hydroids in the mid-to-late 19th century by some, whereas other authors at the time included them in the Siphonophorae. A new order was established for these genera by Totton, in 1954, called the Chondrophora, while at the same time, other authors favored again placing them in the Anthomedusae/Athecatae. Most authors in the past 40 years have accepted interpretation of these animals as unusual floating colonial athecate hydroids, which produce medusae clearly belonging in the Anthomedusae. Although the exact position of the family Porpitidae within the Athecatae/Anthomedusae is not yet clear, the order Chondrophora is no longer used by hydrozoan systematists.

<text>Province of Cattaro () was a province of the Italian Governorate of Dalmatia, created in May 1941 during World War II (by the &quot;Regio Decreto Legge del 18 maggio 1941&quot;). It lasted until September 1943.

==History==
In April 1941, the Italians conquered coastal Dalmatia from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. They created some provinces in that region that lasted until September 1943. One was the &quot;Province of Cattaro&quot;, around the &quot;Gulf of Cattaro&quot;. The administrative capital was the city of Cattaro (now Kotor).

The province (subdivided in 15 &quot;Comuni&quot;) had an area of 547 km2 and a population of 39,800 inhabitants. Prior to the war in 1931, the area consisted out of 13,000 Croats and 18,000 other (mostly Montenegrins and Serbs). with a Dalmatian Italians minority.

The Italians in summer 1941 improved the region by building hospitals and infrastructure, but started a process of Italianization (related to the history of Venetian Albania &amp; the Republic of Venice). Because of this, after one year of peaceful administration &amp; control, in summer 1942 there was a small insurrection against the Italian conquest, but without huge consequences until summer 1943.

In September 1943, the German army took control of the region from the Italians, who had surrendered to the Allies, and soon started a terrible guerrilla war between the Nazi occupiers and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s partisans. The province was abolished in the same September.

==Administrative subdivision==
The 15 &quot;comuni&quot; were (first in Italian the official name and then in Croatian and Serbian the actual):
*Cattaro / Kotor
*Cartolle / Krtole
*Castelnuovo di Cattaro / Herceg Novi
*Dobroto / Dobrota
*Gruda / Gruda
*Lastua Inferiore / Donja Lastva
*Lustizza / Luštica
*Mulla / Muo
*Perasto / Perast
*Perzagno / Prčanj
*Risano / Risan
*Stolivo Inferiore / Donji Stoliv
*Sutorina / Sutorina
*Teodo / Tivat
*Zuppa / Grbalj

<text>Oliver Rackham (17 October 1939 – 12 February 2015) was an academic at the University of Cambridge who studied the ecology, management and development of the British countryside, especially trees, woodlands and wood pasture. His books included &quot;Ancient Woodland&quot; (1980) and &quot;The History of the Countryside&quot; (1986).

==Life and academic career==
Rackham was born in Bungay in Suffolk, and attended King Edward VI School, and then Norwich City College. In 1958 he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating in Natural Sciences in 1961 and subsequently gaining a PhD. He began his academic career studying physics, but moved between several Cambridge departments. He conducted research in the Department of Botany from 1964 to 1968 and 1972 to 1990, and the Plant Breeding Institute of Cambridge from 1968 to 1972. He transferred to the Department of Geography from 1988 to 2000, latterly as Professor, and was appointed Honorary Professor of Historical ecology in the Department of Plant Sciences in 2006 and Honorary Director of the Cambridge Centre for Landscape and People in 2010. Rackham also worked as a tutor in the Kingcombe Centre in Dorset, teaching about the history of woodlands.

He was associated with Corpus Christi College from his student days. He briefly served as Master of the College from 2007 to 2008, and was made a Life Fellow in 2010.

==Contributions==
Rackham was a prolific historical ecologist whose prime interest was the function, history, and management of British woodlands. He kept a series of notebooks, which he began during his youth and continued until his death, in which he recorded observations on plants seen in his home surroundings and on his travels, in addition to information about the weather and his college duties. Arising from his research on Hayley Wood in Cambridgeshire, he developed the concept of ancient woodland, rich in plant diversity and managed through traditional practices. His 1980 book &quot;Ancient Woodland, its History, Vegetation and Uses in England&quot; led to the recognition of such areas by the Forestry Commission and in planning legislation. It also helped to alter forestry industry views about woodland conservation. The Woodland Trust became a larger woodland owner to ensure conservation. He argued for the preservation of traditional management techniques like coppicing, to let light in to increase in the diversity of the herb layer.

In 1986 he published &quot;The History of the Countryside&quot;, regarded as his greatest achievement and described as &quot;a magisterial 400-page account of the British landscape from prehistory to the present day, with chapters on aspects ranging from woodland and hedgerows to marshes and the sea.&quot; The book won several awards for literature. His other books include &quot;Woodlands&quot; (2006), in the Collins &quot;New Naturalist&quot; series, and he also wrote on Hatfield Forest.

As well as working in England, he studied and published extensively on the ecology and landscape of Crete, co-writing &quot;The Making of the Cretan Landscape&quot; with Jenny Moody in 1998, and latterly leading a (failed) protest against the granting of planning permission for the Cavo Sidero golf and hotel project on the island&#x27;s eastern tip. Corpus Christi College named one of their boats &#x27;Rackham the Red&#x27; in his honour.

==Personal life==
Rackham was an only child, and was unmarried. He died on 12 February 2015 at the age of 75 after a short illness.

<text>Bob McDonald OC (born January 25, 1951) is a Canadian author and science journalist. He is the national science commentator for CBC Television and CBC News Network (formerly Newsworld), and since 1992 has been the host of a weekly radio science show, &quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks&quot; which draws approximately 800,000 listeners each week.

==Career==
McDonald was an unexceptional student who admits he showed no aptitude for science, failed grade 9, and attended York University, studying English and Philosophy, but flunked out in his 2nd year. In 1972, with no formal academic training, he began his science communication career as a demonstrator at the Ontario Science Centre, and eventually travelled to California to watch the live action of NASA&#x27;s Voyager 2 space probe launch. Upon returning to Canada, he was in great demand to talk about the missions and eventually became the regular science correspondent for a number of shows.

From 1986 to 1992, he was the host and one of the producers of &quot;Wonderstruck&quot;, a Gemini Award winning science program for children. Over the years he has hosted a variety of other science or technology themed specials and documentaries, including the special The Greatest Canadian Invention. 

In 1992, he became the host of the weekly CBC Radio science program &quot;Quirks &amp; Quarks,&quot; taking over from Jay Ingram. The show is among the most popular on the network, and is also heard on Sirius XM Radio as well as a number of public radio stations in the United States.

On September 8, 2005, McDonald premiered a new three-season, 39-part series on TVOntario called &quot;Heads Up!&quot;, which he both wrote and hosted. Heads Up! was nominated for Gemini awards for best children&#x27;s TV program and best writing for a children&#x27;s TV program in August 2006, and best writing for a children&#x27;s or youth program or series and best host in a preschool, children&#x27;s or youth program or series in August 2008. He was awarded the Gemini for best host in a preschool, children&#x27;s or youth program or series in October 2008. McDonald has written a number of books including &quot;Wonderstruck&quot;, &quot;Wonderstruck II&quot; and &quot;Measuring the Earth with a Stick: Science as I&#x27;ve Seen It&quot;, which was short-listed for the Canadian Science Writers Association book award.

==Honours==
McDonald received the 2001 Michael Smith Award for Science Promotion, from NSERC, the 2002 Sandford Fleming Medal from the Royal Canadian Institute, and the 2005 McNeil Medal for the Public Awareness of Science from the Royal Society of Canada completing the &quot;triple crown&quot; of awards for science communication in Canada. He has been honoured for his work by the University of Toronto, Western University in London, Ontario, the University of Guelph, Laurentian University in Sudbury, Carleton University in Ottawa, McMaster University, the University of Calgary, Athabasca University in Alberta and the University of Winnipeg which each granted him honorary doctorates. McDonald was granted an Honorary Diploma in Environment, Media and Technology Studies from Niagara College on June 16, 2011, and an honorary diploma from Loyalist College on June 10, 2011.

In 2010, McDonald was initiated as an honorary life member of the Sigma Xi honour society.

McDonald was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada on June 30, 2011 &quot;for his contributions, as a journalist and educator, to the public understanding of science.&quot;

In July 2014, an asteroid, that had previously been assigned the number 332324 and the designation 2006 XN67, was named after McDonald. This occurred at the request of David D. Balam, the Canadian astronomer who had discovered the asteroid.

<doc id="1195142" wikidata="Q2035179" url="?curid=1195142" title="La Cage aux Folles (musical)">
<text>La Cage aux Folles () is a musical with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein.

Based on the 1973 French play of the same name, the show tells the story of a gay couple, Georges, the manager of a Saint-Tropez nightclub featuring drag entertainment, and Albin, his romantic partner and star attraction; farcical adventures ensue when household dynamics intersect with an ultra-conservative politician. 

Opening on Broadway in 1983, &quot;La Cage&quot; broke barriers for gay representation by becoming the first hit Broadway musical centered on a homosexual relationship. The show&#x27;s act one finale &quot;I Am What I Am&quot; received praise as a &quot;gay anthem&quot; and has been widely recorded.

The original production ran for more than four years (1,761 performances), and won six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Book.

The success of the musical spawned a West End (London) production and several international runs. Subsequent revivals have garnered considerable success, winning the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical in both 2005 and 2010, as well as the Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival in 2008.

==Background==

Allan Carr, who had produced the successful film adaptation of &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), was eager to work in theatre and thought a musical version of the hit 1978 film &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; would be an ideal vehicle for his Broadway debut. However, he was unable to secure the rights to the film and was forced to settle for the rights to the original play only. Carr hired Jay Presson Allen to write the book and Maury Yeston to compose the score for &quot;The Queen of Basin Street&quot;, an Americanized version set in New Orleans. With Mike Nichols set to direct and Tommy Tune on board as choreographer, Carr searched for executive producers and found them in Fritz Holt and Barry Brown, who immediately fired the entire creative team that Carr had assembled. All of them eventually filed lawsuits, but Yeston alone won and later collected a small royalty from &quot;La Cage&quot;.

Holt and Brown had produced the 1974 revival of &quot;&quot; directed by Arthur Laurents, and they approached him with an offer to direct their new venture. Laurents was not a fan of drag or camp entertainment and thought Holt and Brown never would find enough investors to finance a gay-themed project at a time when, during the early years of the AIDS epidemic, homophobia was more intense than ever. He agreed only because Holt and Brown were close friends and he wanted them to remain on Carr&#x27;s payroll as long as possible, but his interest grew when he learned Harvey Fierstein and Jerry Herman had committed to the project.

According to Laurents, when he met with Fierstein and Herman for the first time, they had restored both the title and locale of the original play but had neither a script nor even an outline for the plot. All they had was the Herman song &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;, and Laurents immediately envisioned it as an emotional outburst sung at the close of the first act. Laurents further claims that when he explained his concept to Fierstein and Herman, he inspired the direction they took in writing the musical. Herman tells a very different story in an interview included in the original cast CD. He claims that they were well into the collaboration when Fierstein arrived one day with an emotional fiery scene he had written for the end of Act I that included the words &quot;I am what I am&quot;. Delighted, Herman asked to use the five words, boasting he would have a song by morning, which he did. With gay-activist Fierstein and the political Laurents on board, the show could have &quot;become a polemic diatribe on gay rights.&quot; However, Herman was a moderating influence. Having suffered a series of disappointments with darker-themed shows since 1969, he was eager to score a hit with a mainstream, emotional, optimistic song-and-dance entertainment that middle-class audiences would enjoy. The team opted to create &quot;a charming, colorful, great-looking musical comedy - an old-fashioned piece of entertainment,&quot; as Herman recalled in his memoir &quot;Showtune&quot;. By &quot;delivering their sentiments in a sweetly entertaining manner&quot;, the team was able to convey their gay-themed message with more impact than they could have with a more aggressive approach.

Fierstein, Herman and Laurents met daily in Herman&#x27;s Manhattan townhouse to work on the musical. Because they were limited to using only the Poiret play as a source, they were unable to include the character of Jean-Michel&#x27;s birth mother, who had been created for the film. They focused the plot on the fact that the relationship of Georges and Albin seems so natural that the boy is able to accept a man as his &quot;mother&quot;. The three men agreed that Albin needed to be as glamorous an entertainer as possible, and Theoni V. Aldredge was hired as costume designer to achieve their goal.

The producers agreed to a Boston tryout, and just before the second preview (the first was cancelled due to problems with the mechanized set), Herman had a panic attack prompted by his fear that the city probably was too conservative to embrace a gay-themed musical, albeit one designed for a mainstream audience. The Boston crowds gave the show an enthusiastic reception. Fierstein, Herman and Laurents were also concerned that this was essentially a love story in which the lovers barely touched each other. Fierstein suggested they kiss on the cheeks at the end, and Laurents, citing the common custom of French men kissing each other on both cheeks, agreed.

George Hearn as Albin had the showier role and many of the big musical numbers. His character was fully drawn, and behind the drag performer, the audience could see &quot;a person driven to take a stand for himself – a notion that all people could relate to.&quot; In contrast, during rehearsals, everyone had supported firing Gene Barry, who was considered adequate but never outstanding as Georges, but finding a replacement proved to be difficult. Finally, just before opening night, Laurents directed him always to look into Hearn&#x27;s eyes, whenever the two men were on stage, so the audience would sense the depth of the couple&#x27;s feelings for each other. The director also had Georges introduce the various club acts with more of a flourish, &quot;like an aria that will land like a musical number.&quot; Both of these last-minute stage directions enabled Barry to get a better grasp of his character. Barry went on to get a Tony nomination for Best Actor in a musical for his efforts, while co-star Hearn took home the trophy.

According to theatre historian John Kenrick, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; helped make the 1983 Broadway season an especially strong one. He noted that following &quot;La Cage&quot; and &quot;Big River&quot; in 1985, for &quot;the first time since &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, a full decade would go by before a new American musical would pass the 1,000-performance mark.&quot;

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Georges, the master of ceremonies, welcomes the audience to his St. Tropez drag nightclub, &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;. The chorus line known as Les Cagelles appear and introduce themselves to the audience (&quot;We Are What We Are&quot;). Georges and his spouse, Albin, have lived happily together for many years in an apartment above La Cage with their &quot;maid&quot; Jacob. Albin is a drag queen and the star performer of La Cage aux Folles under the alias of &quot;Zaza&quot;.

As Albin prepares to perform (&quot;[A Little More] Mascara&quot;), Georges&#x27;s 24 year-old son Jean-Michel (the offspring of a confused, youthful liaison with a woman named Sybil) arrives home with the news that he is engaged to Anne Dindon. Georges is reluctant to approve of Jean-Michel&#x27;s engagement, but Jean-Michel assures his father that he is in love with Anne (&quot;With Anne on My Arm&quot;). Unfortunately, her father is head of the &quot;Tradition, Family and Morality Party&quot;, whose stated goal is to close the local drag clubs. Anne&#x27;s parents want to meet their daughter&#x27;s future in-laws. Jean-Michel has lied to his fiancée, describing Georges as a retired diplomat. Jean-Michel pleads with Georges to tell Albin to absent himself (and his flamboyant behaviors) for the visit - and for Georges to redecorate the apartment in a more subdued fashion. Jean-Michel also asks Georges to invite Sybil, who has barely seen him since his birth, to dinner in Albin&#x27;s stead. Albin returns from the show to greet his son when Georges suggests that they take a walk (&quot;With You on My Arm&quot;).

Georges takes Albin to the Promenade Café, owned by Monsieur and Madame Renaud, where he attempts to soften Albin&#x27;s emotions before telling him of Jean-Michel&#x27;s request (&quot;Song on the Sand&quot;). Before Georges can break the news to him, Albin suggests that they hurry back to La Cage to make it in time for the next show. They arrive in time and Albin takes the stage once more as Zaza (&quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;). While Albin is performing, Georges and Jean-Michel quickly redecorate the house. While Albin is changing for his next number, he notices the two carrying his gowns and demands to know what is going on. Georges finally tells Albin of Jean-Michel&#x27;s plan and expects Albin to explode with fury, but he remains silent. Albin then re-joins Les Cagelles onstage, tells them to leave, and begins to sing alone in defiance of Jean-Michel, stating that he is proud of who he is and refuses to change for anyone (&quot;I Am What I Am&quot;). He throws his wig at Georges and departs in a huff.

===Act II===
The next morning, Georges finds Albin at the Promenade Café after his abrupt departure and apologizes (&quot;Song on the Sand [Reprise]&quot;). He then suggests to Albin that he dress up for dinner as macho &quot;Uncle Al&quot;. Albin is still upset, but reluctantly agrees to act like a heterosexual for Jean-Michel. With the help of Monsieur and Madame Renaud, Georges successfully teaches Albin to abandon his flamboyancy (&quot;Masculinity&quot;). Back at the chastely redesigned apartment, Georges shows &quot;Uncle Al&quot; to Jean-Michel. Jean-Michel doesn&#x27;t like the idea and expresses his dislike for Albin&#x27;s lifestyle. Georges angrily reminds Jean-Michel of how good of a &quot;mother&quot; Albin has been to him (&quot;Look Over There&quot;). They then receive a telegram that Jean-Michel&#x27;s mother Sybil is not coming and Anne&#x27;s parents arrive (&quot;Dishes [Cocktail Counterpoint]&quot;). Hoping to save the day, Albin appears as Jean-Michel&#x27;s buxom, forty-year-old mother, in pearls and sensible shoes. The nervous Jacob burns the dinner, so a trip to a local restaurant, &quot;Chez Jacqueline&quot;, belonging to an old friend of Albin and Georges, is quickly arranged. No one has told Jacqueline of the situation, and she asks Albin (as Zaza) for a song, to which he hesitantly agrees (&quot;The Best of Times&quot;). Everyone in the restaurant begins to take part in the song, causing Albin to yield to the frenzy of performance and tear off his wig at the song&#x27;s climax, revealing his true identity.

Back at the apartment, the Dindons plead with their daughter to abandon her fiancé, for they are appalled by his homosexual parents, but she is in love with Jean-Michel and refuses to leave him. Jean-Michel, deeply ashamed of the way he has treated Albin, asks his forgiveness (&quot;Look Over There [Reprise]&quot;), which is lovingly granted. The Dindons prepare to depart, but their way is blocked by Jacqueline, who has arrived with the press, ready to photograph the notorious anti-homosexual activists with Zaza. Georges and Albin have a proposal: If Anne and Jean-Michel may marry, Georges will help the Dindons escape through La Cage downstairs. Georges bids the audience farewell while Les Cagelles prepare the Dindons for the grand finale (&quot;La Cage aux Folles [Reprise]&quot;). Georges then introduces the Dindons, dressed in drag as members of the nightclub&#x27;s revue, and they escape the paparazzi with Jean-Michel and Anne behind them. With everyone gone, Albin enters and he and Georges briefly sing of their love for each other before sharing a kiss (&quot;Finale [With You On My Arm/La Cage aux Folles/Song on the Sand/The Best Of Times]&quot;).

==Productions==

===Original Broadway production===
&quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre on August 21, 1983. It was directed by Arthur Laurents and choreographed by Scott Salmon, with set design by David Mitchell, costume design by Theoni V. Aldredge, and lighting design by Jules Fisher. The original Broadway cast included Gene Barry as Georges and George Hearn as Albin, with John Weiner as Jean-Michel, Jay Garner as Edouard Dindon, Merle Louise as Mme. Dindon, Elizabeth Parrish as Jacqueline, Leslie Stevens as Anne, and William Thomas Jr. as Jacob. Among the replacement performers who appeared in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; during its original Broadway run were Walter Charles, Keene Curtis, Van Johnson, Peter Marshall, Keith Michell, Jamie Ross and Lee Roy Reams. The original production received nine Tony Award nominations, winning a total of six including Best Musical, Best Original Score and Best Book of a Musical. The show beat several strong competitors in many categories, including Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;. It also won three Drama Desk Awards. The production ran for four years and 1,761 performances, closing on November 15, 1987.

===Original West End production===
The show had its West End premiere at the London Palladium on May 7, 1986, with the same creative team as the Broadway production. Hearn transferred with the production, which was made possible through an agreement with the American and British actors&#x27; unions, allowing him to come over in exchange for Robert Lindsay appearing in &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; on Broadway. The production also starred Denis Quilley as Georges, Jonathon Morris as Jean-Michel, Brian Glover as Edouard Dindon, Julia Sutton as Mme. Dindon, Phyllida Law as Jacqueline, Wendy Roe as Anne and Donald Waugh as Jacob. The show closed in London after 301 performances. Its short run and financial failure were partly blamed on the AIDS crisis, and producers were uncomfortable about portraying gay lives onstage quite so openly in mainstream musicals for some time afterwards.

===2004 Broadway revival===
The first Broadway revival opened at the Marquis Theatre, beginning previews on November 11, 2004, with an official opening on December 9, 2004. The production team included Jerry Zaks as director, Jerry Mitchell as choreographer, Scott Pask, Donald Holder and William Ivey Long as designers. The cast included Gary Beach as Albin, Daniel Davis as Georges, Gavin Creel as Jean-Michel, Michael Mulheren as Edouard Dindon, Linda Balgord as Mme. Dindon, Ruth Williamson as Jacqueline, Angela Gaylor as Anne, and Michael Benjamin Washington as Jacob.

John Hillner took over for Davis as Georges in March on 2005 until Robert Goulet replaced Davis as Georges on April 15, 2005, and played the role until the production closed. Reviews for the production were mixed, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating that it &quot;often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot&quot;, yet praised Les Cagelles, who &quot;bring acrobatic oomph and angularity to centerpieces that include an aviary of exotic, back-flipping birds and a vigorous Montmartre-style can-can. As long as the Cagelles are doing their thing, your attention stays thoroughly engaged&quot;. The revival won a number of Tony and Drama Desk awards. The production closed on June 26, 2005. Ticket sales for the show had not increased after winning the Tony Award, and the show had been consistently selling at less than 60% capacity in the months before closing.

===2008 Menier Chocolate Factory and West End revival===
A scaled-down London revival, starring Philip Quast and Douglas Hodge opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory on January 8, 2008, and played there until March 8, 2008. The cast also included Neil McDermott, Iain Mitchell and Una Stubbs, with direction by Terry Johnson and choreography by Lynne Page. The production had originally been scheduled to open in December 2007, but it was delayed twice due to illness within the cast. The show opened to mostly positive press with particular praise for Hodge&#x27;s performance as Albin.

The Menier Chocolate Factory production transferred to the West End on October 20, 2008, at the Playhouse Theatre co-produced with Sonia Friedman Productions, Robert G. Bartner, David Ian Productions, The Ambassador Theatre Group, Matthew Mitchell and Jamie Hendry Productions. It was initially advertised as a &quot;Strictly Limited 12 Week Season&quot;, although this became open-ended due to its success. Hodge reprised his role as Albin, joined by Denis Lawson as Georges. The cast also included Iain Mitchell as Edouard Dindon/M. Renaud, Paula Wilcox as Mme. Ranaud/Mme. Dindon and Tracie Bennett as Jacqueline. The production gathered rave reviews, with high praise again for Hodge and Les Cagelles. Whatsonstage.com commented: &quot;A great Broadway show has been reborn as a classic musical comedy with real punch and pizzazz.&quot; Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the show had improved with its transfer to the West End from the Menier Chocolate Factory. The production won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival, and Hodge won for Best Actor, out of a total of seven nominations. The roles of Albin and Georges have been re-cast in London every three months with well-known actors to keep the production fresh and public interest high. Television personality Graham Norton took over the role of Albin on January 19, 2009, alongside Steven Pacey as Georges. They were succeeded on May 4, 2009, by theatre veterans Roger Allam as Albin and Philip Quast reprising his role of Georges from the Menier Chocolate Factory. From September 12, 2009, until November 28, 2009, John Barrowman and Simon Burke played the roles of Albin and Georges respectively. Douglas Hodge as Albin and Denis Lawson as Georges returned to the production from 30 November 2009, until the production closed on January 2, 2010.

===2010 Broadway revival===
A transfer of the 2008 London revival to Broadway began previews at the Longacre Theatre on April 6, 2010, and officially opened on April 18, 2010. Johnson and Page directed and choreographed. Douglas Hodge reprised the role of Albin and Kelsey Grammer starred as Georges. The set design was by Tim Shortall, costumes by Matthew Wright, lighting by Nick Richings, and scaled down eight-player orchestrations by Jason Carr. The production received positive reviews, many praising the scaled-down nature of the production and the performances of newcomers Douglas Hodge and Kelsey Grammer as Albin and Georges. The cast also featured A.J Shively in his Broadway debut as Jean-Michel, Robin de Jesús as Jacob, Fred Applegate as Edouard Dindon/M. Renaud, Veanne Cox as Mme. Dindon/Mme. Renaud, Christine Andreas as Jacqueline and Elena Shaddow as Anne. The Cagelles included Nick Adams, Logan Keslar, Sean Patrick Doyle, Nicholas Cunningham, Terry Lavell and Yurel Echezarreta. The production received 11 Tony Award nominations and won Best Musical Revival, Best Actor in a Musical (Douglas Hodge) and Best Direction of a Musical. A cast recording of the revival was made by PS Classics and was released on September 28, 2010. The production closed on May 1, 2011, after 433 performances and 15 previews.

===2011 US tour===
A national tour modeled after the 2010 Broadway revival began in September 2011 starting in Des Moines, Iowa. At first, Fierstein was asked to play the role of Georges and Sieber was asked to play the role of Albin, each taking the role the other had played on Broadway. Due to a full schedule, being set to write the book of the Disney musical &quot;Newsies&quot; and the musical &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;, Fierstein had to decline this offer. This tour starred George Hamilton in the role of Georges and Sieber as Albin. This was Sieber&#x27;s national tour debut.

<text>Gombe State (; ) is a state in northeastern Nigeria, bordered to the north and northeast by the states of Borno in the vicinity of Gongola River and Lake Dadin Kowa and Yobe in the vicinity of Gongola River, to the south by Taraba State, to the southeast by Adamawa State, and to the west by Bauchi State. Gombe is the state capital of Gombe state and it was formed from a part of Bauchi State on 1 October 1996. Of the 36 states in Nigeria, Gombe is the 21st largest in area and the 32nd most populous, with an estimated population of about 3.25 million as of 2016. The state bears a slogan &quot;Jewel in the Savannah&quot;.

Geographically, the state is within the tropical West Sudanian savanna ecoregion. Important geographic features include the Gongola River — which flows through Gombe&#x27;s north and east into Lake Dadin Kowa — and part of the Muri Mountains, a small range in the state&#x27;s far south. Among the state&#x27;s nature endowments are a number of snake species, including carpet viper, puff adder, and Egyptian cobra populations along with hippopotamus, Senegal parrot, and grey-headed kingfisher populations.

The state is inhabited by various ethnic groups, primarily the Fulani people living in the north and center of the state, and the Tangale, living in the Southern and Central part of the state, while the state&#x27;s diverse eastern and southern regions are populated by the Cham, Dadiya, Jara, Kamo, Pero, Tangale, Tera, Lunguda and Waja peoples. Religiously, between 55% and 60% of the state&#x27;s populations are Muslim while the Christian minority comprises between 40% and 45%.

In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Gombe State was split up between various states until the early 1800s when the Fulani jihad seized much of the area to the Northern Gombe and formed the Gombe Emirate under the Sokoto Caliphate while the Tangale seized the Southern Area to establish their Maidom which has traceable history to ElKanemi - Maiduguri migration. In the 1910s, British expeditions occupied the Emirate and the surrounding areas, incorporating them into the Northern Nigeria Protectorate which later merged into British Nigeria before becoming independent as Nigeria in 1960. Originally, modern-day Gombe State was a part of the post-independence Northern Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the North-Eastern State. After the North-Eastern State was split, Bauchi State was formed in 1976 alongside ten other states. Twenty years afterwards, a group of LGAs in Bauchi&#x27;s west were broken off to form the new Gombe State.

Economically, Gombe State is largely based around agriculture, mainly of sorghum, maize, groundnuts, millet, beans, rice and tomatoes mostly in the Central and Southern axis. Other key industries are services, especially in the city of Gombe, and the herding of camels, cattle, goats, and sheep which are predominantly in the Northern axis of the state. Gombe has the fourth lowest Human Development Index and one of the lowest GDPs in the country.
Gombe is one of the &quot;friendliest&quot; cities in Nigeria for doing business, due to its excellent modern infrastructure, secure and stable serenity, transparency and easier accessibility of information, regulatory environment, skills and labour and economic opportunities. These earned her the World Bank&#x27;s yearly appraisal, &quot;The Ease of Doing Business&quot;, in 2021 and 2023.

Undulating hills, sandy rocks, and a few volcanic rocks make up the landscape. Its location in the northeastern zone, right within the expansive savannah, allows the state to share common borders with the states of Borno, Yobe, Taraba, Adamawa and Bauchi.

<text>Radionuclide angiography is an area of nuclear medicine which specialises in imaging to show the functionality of the right and left ventricles of the heart, thus allowing informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. It involves use of a radiopharmaceutical, injected into a patient, and a gamma camera for acquisition. A MUGA scan (multigated acquisition) involves an acquisition triggered (gated) at different points of the cardiac cycle. MUGA scanning is also called equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG), or gated blood pool imaging, as well as SYMA scanning (synchronized multigated acquisition scanning).

This mode of imaging uniquely provides a cine type of image of the beating heart, and allows the interpreter to determine the efficiency of the individual heart valves and chambers. MUGA/Cine scanning represents a robust adjunct to the now more common echocardiogram. Mathematics regarding acquisition of cardiac output (&quot;Q&quot;) is well served by both of these methods as well as other inexpensive models supporting ejection fraction as a product of the heart/myocardium in systole. The advantage of a MUGA scan over an echocardiogram or an angiogram is its accuracy. An echocardiogram measures the shortening fraction of the ventricle and is limited by the user&#x27;s ability. Furthermore, an angiogram is invasive and, often, more expensive. A MUGA scan provides a more accurate representation of cardiac ejection fraction.

== History ==
The MUGA scan was first introduced in the early 1970s and quickly became accepted as the preferred technique for measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with a high degree of accuracy. Several early studies demonstrated an excellent correlation of MUGA-derived LVEF with values obtained by cardiac catheterization contrast ventriculography.

== Purpose ==
Radionuclide ventriculography is done to evaluate coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular heart disease, congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, and other cardiac disorders. MUGA is typically ordered for the following patients:
* With known or suspected coronary artery disease, to diagnose the disease and predict outcomes
* With lesions in their heart valves
* With congestive heart failure
* Who have undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or medical therapy, to assess the efficacy of the treatment
* With low cardiac output after open-heart surgery
* Who are undergoing cardiotoxic drug agents such as in chemotherapy e.g., with doxorubicin or immunotherapy (herceptin)
* Who have had a cardiac transplant

Radionuclide ventriculography gives a much more precise measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Transthoracic echocardiogram is highly operator dependant, therefore radionuclide ventriculography is a more reproducible measurement of LVEF. Its primary use today is in monitoring cardiac function in patients receiving certain chemotherapeutic agents (anthracyclines: doxorubicin or daunorubicin) which are cardiotoxic. The chemotherapy dose is often determined by the patient&#x27;s cardiac function. In this setting, a much more accurate measurement of ejection fraction, than a transthoracic echocardiogram can provide, is necessary.

== Procedure ==
The MUGA scan is performed by labeling the patient&#x27;s red blood pool with a radioactive tracer, technetium-99m-pertechnetate (Tc-99m), and measuring radioactivity over the anterior chest as the radioactive blood flows through the large vessels and the heart chambers.

The introduction of the radioactive marker can either take place &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot;.
In the in vivo method, stannous (tin) ions are injected into the patient&#x27;s bloodstream. A subsequent intravenous injection of the radioactive substance, technetium-99m-pertechnetate, labels the red blood cells &quot;in vivo&quot;. With an administered activity of about 800 MBq, the effective radiation dose is about 6 mSv.

In the &quot;in vitro&quot; method, some of the patient&#x27;s blood is drawn and the stannous ions (in the form of stannous chloride) are injected into the drawn blood. The technetium is subsequently added to the mixture as in the &quot;in vivo&quot; method.
In both cases, the stannous chloride reduces the technetium ion and prevents it from leaking out of the red blood cells during the procedure.

The &quot;in vivo&quot; technique is more convenient for the majority of patients since it is less time-consuming and less costly and more than 80 percent of the injected radionuclide usually binds to red blood cells with this approach. Red blood cell binding of the radioactive tracer is generally more efficient than &quot;in vitro&quot; labeling, and it is preferred in patients with indwelling intravenous catheters to decrease the adherence of Tc-99m to the catheter wall and increase the efficiency of blood pool labeling.

The patient is placed under a gamma camera, which detects the low-level 140 keV gamma radiation being given off by Technetium-99m (99mTc). As the gamma camera images are acquired, the patient&#x27;s heart beat is used to &#x27;gate&#x27; the acquisition. The final result is a series of images of the heart (usually sixteen), one at each stage of the cardiac cycle.

Depending on the objectives of the test, the doctor may decide to perform either a resting or a stress MUGA. During the resting MUGA, the patient lies stationary, whereas during a stress MUGA, the patient is asked to exercise during the scan. The stress MUGA measures the heart performance during exercise and is usually performed to assess the impact of a suspected coronary artery disease. In some cases, a nitroglycerin MUGA may be performed, where nitroglycerin (a vasodilator) is administered prior to the scan.

The resulting images show that the volumetrically derived blood pools in the chambers of the heart and timed images may be computationally interpreted to calculate the ejection fraction and injection fraction of the heart. The Massardo method can be used to calculate ventricle volumes. This nuclear medicine scan yields an accurate, inexpensive and easily reproducible means of measuring and monitoring the ejection and injection fractions of the ventricles, which are one of many of the important clinical metrics in assessing global heart performance.

===Radiation exposure===
It exposes patients to less radiation than do comparable chest x-ray studies. However, the radioactive material is retained in the patient for several days after the test, during which sophisticated radiation alarms may be triggered, such as in airports. Radionuclide ventriculography has largely been replaced by echocardiography, which is less expensive, and does not require radiation exposure.

== Results ==

===Normal results===

In normal subjects, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be about 50%(range, 50-80%). There should be no area of abnormal wall motion (hypokinesis, akinesis or dyskinesis). Abnormalities in cardiac function may be manifested as a decrease in LVEF and/or the presence of abnormalities in global and regional wall motion. For normal subjects, peak filling rates should be between 2.4 and 3.6 end diastolic volume (EDV) per second, and the time to peak filling rate should be 135-212 ms. 

===Abnormal results===

An uneven distribution of technetium in the heart indicates that the patient has coronary artery disease, a cardiomyopathy, or blood shunting within the heart. Abnormalities in a resting MUGA usually indicate a heart attack, while those that occur during exercise usually indicate ischemia. In a stress MUGA, patients with coronary artery disease may exhibit a decrease in ejection fraction.
For a patient that has had a heart attack, or is suspected of having another disease that affects the heart muscle, this scan can help pinpoint the position in the heart that has sustained damage as well as assess the degree of damage. MUGA scans are also used to evaluate heart function prior to and while receiving certain chemotherapies (e.g. doxorubicin (Adriamycin)) or immunotherapy (specifically, herceptin) that have a known effect on heart function.

== Massardo method ==

The Massardo method is one of a number of approaches for estimating the volume of the ventricles and thus ultimately the ejection fraction. Recall that a MUGA scan is a nuclear imaging method involving the injection of a radioactive isotope (Tc-99m) that acquires gated 2D images of the heart using a SPECT scanner. The pixel values in such an image represent the number of counts (nuclear decays) detected from within that region in a given time interval. The Massardo method enables a 3D volume to be estimated from such a 2D image of decay counts via:

formula_1 ,

where formula_2 is the pixel dimension and formula_3 is the ratio of total counts within the ventricle to the number of counts within the brightest (hottest) pixel. The Massardo method relies on two assumptions: (i) the ventricle is spherical and (ii) the radioactivity is homogeneously distributed.

The ejection fraction, formula_4, can then be calculated:

formula_5,

where the EDV (end-diastolic volume) is the volume of blood within the ventricle immediately before a contraction and the ESV (end-systolic volume) is the volume of blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of a contraction. The ejection fraction is hence the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each beat.

The Siemens Intevo SPECT scanners employ the Massardo method in their MUGA scans. Other methods for estimating ventricular volume exist, but the Massardo method is sufficiently accurate and simple to perform, avoiding the need for blood samples, attenuation corrections or decay corrections.

=== Derivation ===

Define the ratio formula_6 as the ratio of counts within the chamber of the heart to the counts in the hottest pixel:

formula_7 .

Assuming that the activity is homogeneously distributed, the total count is proportional to the volume. The maximum pixel count is thus proportional to the length of the longest axis perpendicular to the collimator, formula_8, times the cross-sectional area of a pixel, formula_9. We can thus write:

formula_10 ,

where formula_11 is some constant of proportionality with units counts/cmformula_12. The total counts, formula_13, can be written formula_14 where formula_15 is the volume of the ventricle and formula_11 is the same constant of proportionality since we are assuming a homogeneous distribution of activity. The Massardo method now makes the simplification that the ventricle is spherical in shape, giving

formula_17 ,

where formula_18 is the diameter of the sphere and is thus equivalent to formula_8 above. This allows us to express the ratio formula_6 as

formula_21 ,

finally giving the diameter of the ventricle in terms of formula_6, i.e. counts, alone:

formula_23.

From this, the volume of the ventricle in terms of counts alone is simply

formula_24.

<text>Beach Red is a 1967 World War II film starring Cornel Wilde (who also directed and produced) and Rip Torn. The film depicts a landing by the United States Marine Corps on an unnamed Japanese-held Pacific island. The film is based on Peter Bowman&#x27;s 1945 novella of the same name, which was based on his experiences with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific War.

==Title==
During the Allied amphibious operations in World War II, designated invasion beaches were given a codename by color, such as &quot;Beach Red,&quot; &quot;Beach White,&quot; &quot;Beach Blue&quot;, etc. There was a &quot;Beach Red&quot; on virtually every assaulted island, in accordance with the standard beach designation hierarchy.

==Plot==
The 30-minute opening sequence of the film depicts an opposed beach landing. Its graphic depiction of the violence and savagery of war was echoed years later in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. In one scene during the landing, a Marine is shown with his arm blown off, similar to Thomas C. Lea III&#x27;s 1944 painting &quot;The Price&quot;.

As Americans are shown consolidating their gains, flashbacks illustrate the lives of American and Japanese combatants. Shifting first-person voice-over in a stream-of-consciousness style is also used to portray numerous characters&#x27; thoughts. Like Wilde&#x27;s previous production of &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; (1965), the film does not use subtitles for characters speaking Japanese.

The film contains large sections of voice-over narration, often juxtaposed with still photographs of wives, etc. (who are anachronistically dressed in 1967 attire). Many soldiers in the film shed tears, and the narrative displays an unusual amount of sympathy for the enemy.

In one scene, an injured Cliff is lying close to an injured Japanese soldier in a scene paralleling the one from &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; with Paul Bäumer and Gérard Duval. Just after the two soldiers bond, other Marines appear and kill the Japanese soldier, distressing Cliff.

Director, producer, and co-writer Wilde plays a Marine captain, the company commander. Rip Torn plays his company gunnery sergeant, who utters the film&#x27;s tagline, &quot;That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re here for. To kill. The rest is all crap!&quot;

==Cast==
* Cornel Wilde - Captain MacDonald
* Rip Torn - Gunnery Sergeant Honeywell
* Burr DeBenning - Egan
* Patrick Wolfe - Cliff
* Jean Wallace - Julie
* Jaime Sánchez - Colombo
* Dale Ishimoto - Captain Tanaka

==Production==
&quot;Beach Red&quot; was filmed on location in the Philippines using troops of the Philippine Armed Forces. The sequence of the Japanese dressed in Marine uniforms was inspired by Bowman&#x27;s book, which mentions Japanese wearing American helmets to infiltrate American lines. There were no incidents in the Pacific where large numbers of Japanese donned American uniforms and attempted to infiltrate a beachhead. The action, though, is similar in some ways to a large-scale Japanese counterattack and banzai charge conducted on July 7, 1944, on Saipan, which was defeated by U.S. Army troops with heavy losses.

When seeking assistance from the U.S. Marine Corps, Wilde was told that due to the commitments of the Vietnam War, all the Corps could provide the film was color stock footage taken during the Pacific War. The film provided had deteriorated, so Wilde had to spend a considerable part of the film&#x27;s budget to restore the film to an acceptable quality in order to blend into the film. The Marine Corps was grateful that their historical film had been restored at no cost to them.

The film&#x27;s title sequence incorporates various paintings that suddenly segue into the preparations for the landing.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s single musical theme is by Col. Antonino Buenaventura, a National Artist of the Philippines in Music. It appears in the title sequence, sung in a folk song manner by Jean Wallace – Wilde&#x27;s wife – and appears in various other orchestrations throughout the film. Wallace also appears in flashback photos as Wilde&#x27;s character&#x27;s wife, Julie MacDonald.

==Reception==
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;an admirable war movie that says a bit and suggests even more, thanks to Cornel Wilde.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;[i]n contrast to many professedly anti-war films, Beach Red &quot;[sic]&quot; is indisputably sincere in its war is hell message.&quot; In a capsule review published many years after the film debuted, &quot;Time Out London&quot; wrote, &quot;Wilde&#x27;s neglected WWII movie is an allegory about the futility and the carnage of Vietnam. ... The movie is massively and harrowingly brutal, almost like a horror movie, with severed limbs washing up on the beach. Although Wilde deals exclusively in pacifist clichés, the film has a genuine primitive power; in fact, it&#x27;s the equal of anything made by Fuller.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;Beach Red&quot; received a 1968 Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing.

<text>The Subsecretaria de Inteligência (Under-Secretariat of Intelligence) or SSI was the Brazilian Intelligence Agency that replaced the Brazilian military junta intelligence agency called the SNI. In 1995, the SSI was replaced by the ABIN.

This Subsecretaria de Inteligência was subordinated to the [[Secretaria de Assuntos Estratégicos]] (Strategic Affairs Secretariat) or SAE, which replaced the SNI during the Fernando Collor de Mello government (see this document) and was replaced by the ABIN in the FHC government (1997). In the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva government the ABIN received more powers for telephone tampering.

<doc id="1195160" wikidata="Q5247012" url="?curid=1195160" title="Dearne Valley line">
<text>The Dearne Valley line is the name given to a railway line in the north of England running from York to Sheffield via Pontefract Baghill and Moorthorpe. The route was built over several years and consists of lines built by several railway companies.

==History==
The northernmost section of the route was opened in stages by the fledgling York and North Midland Railway (Y&amp;NM), a company which belonged to the railway empire of George Hudson. York to Sherburn Junction was completed in 1839 to form a link with the Leeds and Selby Railway, which was later taken over by the Y&amp;NM. This section includes Ulleskelf, Church Fenton and Sherburn-in-Elmet stations, as well as the former station sites at Copmanthorpe (closed 1959) and Bolton Percy (closed 1965).

Y&amp;NM extended the line to Altofts Junction in 1840 to meet the new North Midland Railway as part of a new route from York to London St Pancras via Normanton, Swinton, Chesterfield and Derby. Stations on this section were Milford (closed 1904), Monk Fryston (closed 1959) and Burton Salmon (also closed in 1959), where the present route diverges. The next section, from Burton Salmon to Ferrybridge, was completed in 1850 to form a link between York and Knottingley; Ferrybridge station closed in 1965.

From Ferrybridge, the route takes up the course of the Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway, constructed in 1879. The first station encountered is Pontefract Baghill, which remains open today, before the line reaches a closed station at Ackworth (last served in 1951), then the station at Moorthorpe. The small hamlet of Frickley saw its station close in 1953, but two new stations at Thurnscoe and Goldthorpe were opened in 1986. These are primarily served by Wakefield Line trains; the two Dearne Valley line trains a day pass through without stopping. Finally, the S&amp;KJR&#x27;s Bolton-on-Dearne station has remained open throughout.

Beyond Bolton-on-Dearne the line joins the North Midland&#x27;s route to the south, opened in 1840 and serving Swinton, a new station here replacing that closed in 1967 and Kilnhurst West (also closed in 1967).

At Aldwarke Junction the route diverges from the North Midland via a junction constructed by British Rail and opened in 1965. Here it joins the former Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway line, part of a link between two branch lines opened many years earlier by the South Yorkshire Railway. This section once had stations at Parkgate and Aldwarke (closed 1951) and at Rotherham Road (closed 1953), before reaching the former Rotherham Central re-opened, slightly nearer the College Road bridge, in 1987 by British Rail. Leaving Rotherham Central we take the &quot;Holmes Chord&quot;, a single line to Holmes Junction where we take to the rails of the Sheffield &amp; Rotherham company, which opened its line in 1838 and which once served Holmes (closed in 1955), Meadowhall (a new station opened in 1991), Wincobank (closed 1956), Brightside (closed 1994) and Attercliffe Road (closed 1994), before arriving at Sheffield. The section between Holmes Junction, adjacent to the station and Grimesthorpe Junction is the oldest section of the route.

=== Electrification ===
Electrification of the section between Colton junction and Church Fenton is underway. Two bridges were raised to create room for overhead wires in April 2015. This work was due to be complete by 2023, but this was impacted by delays. The work was completed and the first train ran between the two stations in September 2024.

==Current services==
Services which operate over the entire length of the route are provided by Northern Trains. Freight trains also regularly use the route.

Northern services, usually make just three round trips daily, from Sheffield to York calling at Meadowhall Interchange, Rotherham Central, Swinton, Moorthorpe, Pontefract Baghill, Sherburn-in-Elmet, Church Fenton and Ulleskelf. However, the summer 2022 timetable has buses replacing trains, and the services only operating between Moorthorpe and York. Several lines across Yorkshire had their services either cut, or replaced by buses, with Northern attributing the problem to a lack of drivers and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. This service was more frequent in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g. the 1988 timetable had seven trains per day in each direction Mon-Sat, including a summer only through service to and from , and four each way on Sundays), but since a major round of cutbacks in 1991 (due to a shortage of rolling stock) the service frequency has gradually declined.

The northern part of the route as far as Colton Junction is used by all Edinburgh to London King&#x27;s Cross expresses, as well as the numerous CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Northern York to Leeds workings which continue as far as Church Fenton. Sherburn-in-Elmet is served by some York–Selby/Hull trains which diverge from the route at Sherburn South Junction, but beyond this point the only passenger trains are the infrequent Sheffield–York local services, until Moorthorpe is reached.

Overall, the effect of this is that there are only three departures in each direction from Pontefract Baghill per day, although there are two other stations in Pontefract ( and Tanshelf). The line is however a busy freight artery (particularly with bulk loads of imported coal for the power stations at Ferrybridge, Eggbrough and Drax and also further afield in the East Midlands) and also a useful diversionary route, which ensures its continuing survival.

In 2017, the section through Rotherham Central was adapted for use by Sheffield Supertram, the light rail network that operates within Sheffield. Supertram is operating a pilot tram-train service over the route, testing the feasibility of such an operation. This is initially intended to run for two years, with an extension of the operation should it prove successful. It involved the construction of a new chord between the National Rail line and Supertram&#x27;s own network, with a tram platform built at and a short siding to serve the Rotherham Parkgate tram stop terminus with the extension electrified. It opened on 25 October 2018.

<text>Cwmcarn is a village situated in the Ebbw valley in south Wales, in the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire. It grew with 19th-century coal mining, but is now known for its extensive mature forestry and greenery, that attract thousands of visitors and mountain biking enthusiasts each year. 

== Pre-industrial history ==
Significant settlement at Cwmcarn came with Bronze Age migration of local tribes from the Gwent levels to the uplands of Mynydd y Grug, Mynydd Machen and Mynydd Maen (Twmbarlwm) and led to a later Iron Age (900–55 BC) hillfort to be constructed by the Silures on Twmbarlwm.

Roman forces took control of most of what became the Roman province of Britannia Superior in 43 AD but then took a further 25 years to gain control of the present day South Wales valleys. Roman control remained established until full scale withdrawal in the 5th century AD when the Kingdoms of Gwent and Glywysing were established. Gwent was defined as the land between the River Usk and the River Wye and Glywysing, the land between the River Usk and the River Tawe. Cwmcarn, located where the Carn and Ebbw river valleys meet, being situated within the Welsh Kingdom of Glywysing.

The Welsh placename of Cwmcarn came about in 942 when Llywarch ap Cadogan gave Villa Treficarn Pont (&#x27;estate near the bridge over the Carn&#x27;) to a Bishop of Llandaff named Wulfrith with King Cadell&#x27;s guarantee, i.e. the place where the Carn meets the Ebbw (now Cwmcarn).

Following the Norman invasion of Wales the separate townships of Abercarn, Cwmcarn and Newbridge were given a manorial title of Abercarne. The three townships were also within the boundaries of the ancient parish of Mynyddislwyn and remained therein up until comparatively recent times.

== Economic activity ==
=== Coal mining ===
Cwmcarn lies at the south-eastern edge of the South Wales coalfield. The colliery development in the Cwmcarn area started in 1836, when a single shallow, 180 ft downshaft, the Abercarn No.6., was sunk into the Rock (or Tillery) seam, for the nearby Prince of Wales Colliery at Abercarn operated by the Monmouthshire Iron and Coal Company. The second shaft was excavated by the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron &amp; Coal Company to target the deeper No.4 Steam and Black Vein seams. The colliery was run as an individual unit until it was later acquired by Partridge Jones and John Paton and Company in 1935. It was closed by the National Coal Board in November 1968 and the site was cleared after becoming uneconomical to run.

The Cwmcarn Forest Drive now runs over the shafts of the colliery and a relics of colliery buildings can still be seen on the slope above the old shaft. The present day lake that is stocked by the Cwmcarn Angling Association was originally down stream of the colliery&#x27;s washery.

=== Manufacturing ===
A telecoms factory located between the Ebbw River and the A467 road was part of the British Post Office and British Telecom before being sold to STC plc, Northern Telecom (Nortel), and more recently Solectron. The factory closed during Spring 2007.

== Cwmcarn Forest Drive ==
To the east of the village of Cwmcarn is the popular Cwmcarn Forest Drive, a popular 7 mile drive through hills and forests on the flanks of the mountain of Twmbarlwm which is operated by Natural Resources Wales. The area is popular as a tourist site and a location for mountain biking, and has seen significant recent development as the world-class Y Mynydd Mojo DH Track mountain biking trail is attracting an increased volume of visitors. A new £2 million visitor centre has been opened.

In the summer of 2018 the area suffered a spate of extensive fires which were deliberately set and &quot;killed many of the newly-planted saplings on the hillsides.&quot;

The area was also a victim of the spread of phytophthora ramorum, which had required the felling of &quot;vast swathes&quot; of larch trees in the area to prevent the disease spreading further.

Natural Resources Wales project manager for Cwmcarn, Geminie Drinkwater, stated in September 2019 that alongside local activist Robert Southall and Friends of Cwmcarn Forest Drive, they are now &quot;planting countless native trees, to repopulate Cwmcarn&#x27;s ancient woodland&quot; and are &quot;looking to improve the forestry and restore it as a tourist hotspot&quot; in conjunction with the local activist group.
