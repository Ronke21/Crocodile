<text>James Otto Richardson (18 September 1878 – 2 May 1974) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served from 1902 to 1947. 

As commander in chief of the United States Fleet (CinCUS), Richardson protested the redeployment of the Pacific portion of the fleet to Pearl Harbor. He believed that a forward defense was neither practical nor useful, and that the Pacific Fleet would be a logical first target in the event of war with Japan. He was relieved of command in February 1941. His concerns proved justified during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, only ten months later.

==Early life and career==
Richardson was born in Paris, Texas. He entered the United States Naval Academy in 1898 and graduated fifth in a class of eighty-five in 1902. His first duty assignments were in the Asiatic Squadron, where he took part in the Philippine campaign and, after 1905, in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1907 to 1909, Lieutenant Richardson commanded the torpedo boats and and the Third Division, Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla. He was a member of the first class of the Navy&#x27;s Post Graduate Engineering School in 1909–
to 1911 and served as an engineer on the battleship and on the staff of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In 1914, Richardson was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was attached to the Department of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Steam Engineering, where he worked to assure the Navy&#x27;s fuel supply.

==World War I and interwar years==
In 1917 to 1919, Commander Richardson was navigator and executive officer of the battleship . Following a tour at the Naval Academy, he was given command of the gunboat in 1922 and took her out to Asiatic waters, where he also had command of the South China Patrol. Captain Richardson was Assistant to the Chief, Bureau of Ordnance, in 1924 to 1927. In the late 1920s, he commanded a destroyer division and returned to the US for service with the Bureau of Navigation (BuNav).

In January 1931, Captain Richardson placed the new heavy cruiser in commission and commanded her for more than two years. After a tour as a Naval War College student in 1933–1934, he was Budget Officer at the Navy Department, receiving promotion to rear admiral while he was in that position in December 1934. His early duties as a flag officer included command of a Scouting Force cruiser division, service as aide and Chief of Staff to Admiral J.M. &quot;Bull&quot; Reeves, and a tour as Commander Destroyers, Scouting Force. He became Assistant CNO to Admiral William D. Leahy in June 1937, handling the Washington end of the search for Amelia Earhart and the attack on the . A year later, he became chief of the Bureau of Navigation. In early 1938, he assisted Army Major General Stanley Embick with the compilation of more current military plans for a war against Japan, then called War Plan Orange. In June 1939, Richardson went back to sea as Commander, Battle Force (ComBatFor), U.S. Fleet, with the temporary rank of admiral.

==Pearl Harbor and aftermath==
Beginning in January 1940, Richardson was Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CinCUS), which was command of both the Scouting Force (Atlantic Fleet) and Battle Force (Pacific Fleet). At the time of his appointment, Richardson was particularly suited for the post:

[Richardson] was one of the Navy&#x27;s foremost figures. Since his earliest days, after leaving Annapolis, he had made the study of Japanese warfare his life&#x27;s work. He was beyond question the Navy&#x27;s outstanding authority on Pacific naval warfare and Japanese strategy. 

Richardson held the position during a stressful period marked by presidential orders to deploy the Pacific part of the fleet to Pearl Harbor from its traditional naval base in San Diego, California. He noted:

In 1940, the policy-making branch of the Government in foreign affairs − the President and the Secretary of State − thought that stationing the Fleet in Hawaii would restrain the Japanese. They did not ask their senior military advisors whether it would accomplish such an end.

Richardson protested this redeployment to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and to others in Washington. He believed that advanced bases like Guam and Hawaii were necessary, but that insufficient funding and efforts had been made to prepare them for use in wartime. He also believed future battles in the Pacific would involve aircraft carriers, and more scouting forces would be needed to locate them. Additionally, Richardson argued that morale would suffer due to there being &quot;too few white women; shopkeepers gypped the sailors.&quot; Richardson recognized how vulnerable the fleet would be in such an exposed and remote position, a logistical nightmare that was only worsened by the slim resources and the lack of preparation and organization. Richardson argued such a forward defense was not practical or useful, despite Japan&#x27;s attack on China and whatever promises had been made to the United Kingdom to come to its aid if attacked. According to advance knowledge conspiracy theorist John T. Flynn, the fleet had little in the way of housing, materials, or defensive mechanisms at Pearl Harbor. Richardson wanted to return to the West Coast, prepare the fleet, and then perhaps return to Pearl Harbor:

It was Richardson&#x27;s belief − and indeed generally supported by the Navy − that the Fleet should never be berthed inside Pearl Harbor where it would be a mark for attack. This was particularly true in such troubled times when the airways of the East were hot with rumors of approaching conflict. What is more, Richardson held the belief that Pearl Harbor was the logical first point of attack for the Japanese High Command, wedded as it was to the theory of undeclared and surprise warfare. For ten years the U.S. Navy held &quot;attacks&quot; on the Army defenses at Pearl Harbor, and were always successful. Defending the base was rather hopeless, in his mind.

Richardson twice traveled to Washington to meet with Roosevelt to discuss the issue. He followed that up with an official letter to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral Harold R. Stark, pointing out his own firm conviction that neither the Navy nor the country was prepared for war with Japan. After his early October visit to Roosevelt, on October 26, 1940, a White House leak to the Washington-based &quot;Kiplinger Newsletter&quot; predicted that Richardson would be removed as fleet commander. During that October visit with FDR, Richardson told the President his belief that “the senior officers of the Navy do not have the trust and confidence in the civilian leadership of this country that is essential for the successful prosecution of a war in the pacific.&quot; Most believed he might be promoted upwards to replace Stark as CNO, but, instead he was fired. On 1 February 1941, General Order 143 reorganized the United States Fleet. In its place, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and the U.S. Pacific Fleet were re-established, each under its own commander in chief. The same day, Richardson was replaced by Admiral Husband Kimmel as the new Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet (CinCPac) and as CinCUS in case the two ocean fleets merged. Admiral Ernest King became Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CinCLant) on the same day and later CinCUS in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Upon his relief by Roosevelt, &quot;Richardson reverted to his permanent rank of rear admiral and served as a member of the Navy General Board, and in the office of the Secretary of the Navy until his retirement on October 1, 1942.&quot;

Transferred to the retired list with the rank of admiral in October 1942, he remained on active service with the Navy Relief Society, as senior member of a &quot;Special Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee&quot; on the reorganization of the national defense, as one of the first called before the Congressional Committee on Pearl Harbor and as a witness before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Released from active duty in January 1947, he thereafter resided in Washington, D.C.

He and his friend, Admiral George C. Dyer, later produced a book, &quot;On the Treadmill to Pearl Harbor&quot;.

Richardson died on 2 May 1974 at his home in Washington, DC.

==Awards and decorations==
Richardson&#x27;s decorations include: Navy Spanish Campaign Medal, Philippine Campaign Medal, World War I Victory Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal.

<doc id="1210782" wikidata="Q1303501" url="?curid=1210782" title="Eight-to-fourteen modulation">
<text>Eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM) is a data encoding technique – formally, a &quot;line code&quot; – used by compact discs (CD), laserdiscs (LD) and pre-Hi-MD MiniDiscs. [[#EFMPlus|EFMPlus]] is a related code, used in DVDs and Super Audio CDs (SACDs).

EFM and EFMPlus were both invented by Kees A. Schouhamer Immink. According to European Patent Office former President Benoît Battistelli, &quot;Immink&#x27;s invention of EFM made a decisive contribution to the digital revolution.&quot;

== Technological classification ==
EFM belongs to the class of DC-free run-length limited (RLL) codes; these have the following two properties:
* the spectrum (power density function) of the encoded sequence vanishes at the low-frequency end, and
* both the minimum and maximum number of consecutive bits of the same kind are within specified bounds.

In optical recording systems, servo mechanisms accurately follow the track in three dimensions: radial, focus, and rotational speed. Everyday handling damage, such as dust, fingerprints, and tiny scratches, not only affects retrieved data, but also disrupts the servo functions. In some cases, the servos may skip tracks or get stuck. Specific sequences of pits and lands are particularly susceptible to disc defects, and disc playability can be improved if such sequences are barred from recording. The use of EFM produces a disc that is highly resilient to handling and solves the engineering challenge in a very efficient manner.

== How it works ==
Under EFM rules, the data to be stored is first broken into eight-bit blocks (bytes). Each eight-bit block is translated into a corresponding fourteen-bit codeword using a lookup table.

The 14-bit words are chosen such that binary ones are always separated by a minimum of two and a maximum of ten binary zeros. This is because bits are encoded with NRZI encoding, or modulo-2 integration, so that a binary one is stored on the disc as a change from a land to a pit or a pit to a land, while a binary zero is indicated by no change. A sequence 0011 would be changed into 1101 or its inverse 0010, depending on the previous pit written. If there are two consecutive zeros between two ones, then the written sequence will have three consecutive zeros (or ones), for example, 010010 will translate into 100011 (or 011100). The EFM sequence 000100010010000100 will translate into 111000011100000111 (or its inverse).

Because EFM ensures that there are at least two zeros between every two ones, it is guaranteed that every pit and land is at least three bit-clock cycles long. This property is very useful, since it reduces the demands on the optical pickup used in the playback mechanism. The ten consecutive-zero maximum ensures worst-case clock recovery in the player.

EFM requires three merging bits between adjacent fourteen-bit codewords. Although they are not needed for decoding, they ensure that consecutive codewords can be concatenated without violating the specified minimum and maximum runlength constraint. They are also selected to maintain DC balance of the encoded sequence. Thus, in the final analysis, seventeen bits of disc space are needed to encode eight bits of data.

== EFMPlus ==
EFMPlus is the channel code used in DVDs and SACDs.

The EFMPlus encoder is based on a deterministic finite automaton having four states, which translates eight-bit input words into sixteen-bit codewords. The binary sequence generated by the finite state machine encoder has at least two and at most ten zeros between consecutive ones, which is the same as in classic EFM. There are no packing (merging) bits as in classic EFM.

EFMPlus effectively reduces storage requirements by one channel bit per user byte, increasing storage capacity by 1/16 = 6.25%. Decoding of EFMPlus-generated sequences is accomplished by a sliding-block decoder of length two, that is, two consecutive codewords are required to uniquely reconstitute the sequence of input words.

<text>The Orchestra at Temple Square (Orchestra) is a 110-member orchestra based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Orchestra was created in 1999 under the direction of Gordon B. Hinckley, then the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as part of an initiative to continually strengthen and expand the capabilities of the church&#x27;s music organizations.

== History ==
Formed in 1999, the Orchestra fulfilled the desire of LDS Church leaders of having a permanent orchestra both to enhance the quality of the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square (Choir) performances and to involve instrumental musicians in church music projects on the same volunteer basis as Tabernacle Choir members. While some initial recording contracts in the first years of the Orchestra&#x27;s existence were paid, with the creation of the Tabernacle Choir&#x27;s own recording label the 110-member Orchestra has evolved into a purely volunteer organization. Although many Orchestra members are professional musicians, in order to participate they are required to give their time and talents to the Orchestra without financial compensation.

Like the Tabernacle Choir, the Orchestra makes its home in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. During structural renovations to the Tabernacle, the Orchestra rehearsed and performed in the adjacent LDS Conference Center, as did the Choir.

The Orchestra was initially directed by former Tabernacle Choir associate director (and current creative director of Utah Chamber Artists) Barlow Bradford. Under his direction the group developed into a critically acclaimed symphony orchestra. Bradford unexpectedly resigned shortly after the 2002 Winter Olympics. The Orchestra continued under the musical supervision of Tabernacle Choir director Craig Jessop, until his abrupt resignation on March 4, 2008. Under his direction, the Orchestra increased its role as accompanist to the Tabernacle Choir and Temple Square Chorale, but continued to perform on its own under the baton of Igor Gruppman, concertmaster of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. Gruppman was the Orchestra’s concertmaster at the inaugural concert in 1999 and was named conductor of the Orchestra in 2003.

== Repertoire and performances ==
The Orchestra performs masterworks from the standard symphony orchestra repertoire several times a year, both at home and on tour, under the direction of the Ukrainian-born Gruppman.

The Orchestra also regularly appears in the Tabernacle Choir&#x27;s weekly radio and TV broadcasts of Music &amp; the Spoken Word, the Choir&#x27;s acclaimed Christmas specials on PBS, and in the Choir&#x27;s recording projects, including several on the Telarc label. More recent recordings on the Choir&#x27;s own label have enjoyed tremendous success, appearing prominently on Billboard&#x27;s classical and classical crossover charts. Additionally, the Orchestra accompanies the Temple Square Chorale in its semiannual concerts and has provided the music for various LDS Church stage productions such as the annual Christmas favorite &quot;Savior of the World&quot;.

==Guest artists==
The Orchestra featured pianist George Li and organist Clay Christiansen at its fifteenth anniversary celebration concert.

<text>The [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] speed or observer invariant speed is a speed which is measured to be the same in all reference frames by all observers. The invariance of the speed of light is one of the postulates of special relativity, and the terms &quot;speed of light&quot; and &quot;invariant speed&quot; are often considered synonymous. In non-relativistic classical mechanics, or Newtonian mechanics, finite invariant speed does not exist (the only invariant speed predicted by Newtonian mechanics is infinity).

<doc id="1210798" wikidata="Q4358004" url="?curid=1210798" title="Music &amp; the Spoken Word">
<text>Music &amp; the Spoken Word is a religious radio and television series. Broadcast weekly from the Salt Lake Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Utah, the program primarily features performances of music by Tabernacle Choir (Choir)—often accompanied by the Salt Lake Tabernacle organ and the Orchestra at Temple Square. The program also includes spiritual messages and passages related to a specific episode&#x27;s theme (the &quot;spoken word&quot;), presented by Derrick Porter. 

&quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; has been broadcast continually on the Salt Lake City-based KSL radio since 1929, making it the United States&#x27; longest-running national radio program carried continuously on a network. The program has received two Peabody Awards, and was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2004, and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2010. The program made its television debut in October 1949, and is currently the longest-running non-news program on television. It airs in syndication on television.

The radio program is distributed by the CBS Radio Network; its flagship station is KSL, which is owned by Bonneville International, a division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). KSL is a former CBS Radio affiliate; it switched to ABC Radio in 2005. The program is also heard on Sunday mornings over 50,000 watt KOA radio from Denver, also a former CBS Radio affiliate. In addition, it is currently broadcast by over 2,000 television and radio stations worldwide, including Bonneville International-owned KOIT-FM in San Francisco, KIRO-FM in Seattle-Tacoma, and KTAR-AM-FM in Phoenix.

==History==
The Choir&#x27;s first network radio program, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; was first transmitted on July 15, 1929. The organ, choir, and announcer shared a single microphone that was attached to the ceiling of the tabernacle. The announcer stood on a ladder in order to speak into it. A telegraph was used to alert the sound engineer at KSL radio to start the broadcast. Anthony C. Lund was the director of the Choir for the first program, with Earl J. Glade, the general manager of KSL, as its director and producer. 

Beginning in 1930, Richard L. Evans became the program&#x27;s first regular host. Evans held this role until his death in 1971, when he was succeeded by J. Spencer Kinard. Lloyd D. Newell hosted the program from 1991 to 2024.

In 2004, in conjunction with its 75th anniversary, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters&#x27; Radio Hall of Fame. It is one of only two radio programs to have been inducted, the other being the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;.

The program was also inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2010.

Through early 2020, the program&#x27;s continuous new weekly broadcasts led to it becoming the longest continuous weekly program in television and radio broadcasting history. The program has occasionally aired reruns when the Choir is on concert tours. 

In March 2020, the Choir suspended activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; went on hiatus and broadcast reruns. By April 2020, these reruns were augmented with new studio segments recorded in the Tabernacle by Newell with a skeleton crew.

In July 2021, the Choir announced that it would begin to resume operations. New episodes of &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; officially resumed on October 24, 2021, originating from the LDS Church&#x27;s Conference Center with no studio audience. Due to the Omicron variant, the Choir suspended operations again in December 2021, extending a pre-scheduled hiatus for the holiday season through March 2022. At the time, &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; resumed broadcasts from the Salt Lake Tabernacle for the first time since March 2020.

On December 10, 2023, Newell announced he would depart his role with the Choir and &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot; in July 2024 to fill a role as a mission president. In March 2024, the First Presidency announced that Derrick Porter would become the new host, with Newell&#x27;s final episode being on June 16, and Porter debuting on June 23.

==Broadcast==
Each broadcast revolves around a specific theme which is usually based on a religious and uplifting topic which have included family, hope, faith, Christmas, patriotism, joy, peace, kindness, etc., and are usually broadly Christian in application.

===Music===
The Choir performs both sacred and secular pieces that correspond with the chosen message. In addition to hymns and sacred anthems, the Choir has performed Broadway songs, such as &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot; from &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; patriotic American songs, such as &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, as well as a wide range of other selections. The broadcast also regularly features an organ solo played by one of the tabernacle organists.

On some occasions, special guests will also perform with the choir during the broadcast. These guests have included Renée Fleming, Frederica von Stade, Sissel, The King&#x27;s Singers, Maureen McGovern, and other well-known groups, musicians, news anchors, and actors.

====Choir====
The Grammy Award-winning Choir is a 360-voice choir that was founded in Utah in 1847, one month after the Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley.

Called &quot;America&#x27;s Choir&quot; by U.S. President Ronald Reagan, all members of the choir are volunteers and are not remunerated. The Choir is led by director Mack Wilberg.

In addition to &quot;Music and &amp; Spoken Word&quot;, the Choir performs regularly throughout the year, including annual Christmas, Pioneer, and various other concerts, as well providing music for the LDS Church&#x27;s general conference. The Choir has also been on national and international tours.

====Orchestra====
The Orchestra at Temple Square was created in 1999 in order to increase the aesthetic and musical quality of performances. The Orchestra frequently provides accompaniment for the weekly radio and TV broadcasts.

The Orchestra also undertakes its own concert season performing from standard orchestral literature, which has included Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 4, &quot;the Firebird Suite&quot; by Stravinsky and Symphony No. 9 (from &quot;The New World&quot;) by Dvořák.

Like the Choir, the 110-member Orchestra is made up of volunteers, some of whom are also professional musicians.

====Organ and organists====
The Salt Lake Tabernacle organ is a very visible and notable part of the building. The original organ was made by Joseph Harris Ridges (1827–1914), a native of Australia, and contained seven hundred pipes. However, the number of pipes is now 11,623, making it one of the world&#x27;s largest pipe organs. The current organ is largely the work of G. Donald Harrison of the former Aeolian-Skinner organ firm. It was completed in the late 1940s. The organ has undergone a few minor modifications since that time.

The organ is currently played by five main organists when accompanying the Choir. Richard Elliott, Andrew Unsworth, and Brian Mathias are full-time organists, while Linda Margetts and Joseph Peeples are part-time organists.

===The &quot;Spoken Word&quot;===
The program features inspirational messages, constituting the eponymous &quot;Spoken Word&quot;. The original writer, producer, and announcer of the spoken portion of the broadcast was Richard L. Evans, who continued in that capacity for over forty years until his death in 1971. At that time the writing and announcing assignments were split, with a committee doing the writing. J. Spencer Kinard was the announcer from 1972 until he stepped down in 1990. Lloyd D. Newell served as the host of the program from 1991 to 2024, when he was succeeded by Derrick Porter. According to Newell, Gordon B. Hinckley, then a counselor in the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency, instructed him that &quot;each message should be an &#x27;inspirational gem&#x27;&quot;, and that when writing the messages, he should consider &quot;whether they would enlighten and inspire listeners and have an insight or perspective that is wide and interesting and encouraging.&quot;

=== International broadcasts ===
The program has been broadcast in other languages, with the opening sequence and Spoken Word segment either subtitled or dubbed in the respective language. On July 30, 2023, a pilot began for a dedicated Spanish-language edition of &quot;Music &amp; the Spoken Word&quot;,: it contains the same performances as the English-language version, but uses a rotating cast of Spanish-language announcers and other imagery specific to Spanish culture.

==Performance venue==

The program is broadcast from the Salt Lake Tabernacle, more commonly called the Mormon Tabernacle. The dome-shaped building was built between 1864 and 1867 on the west center-line axis of the Salt Lake Temple and is located inside Temple Square. The overall seating capacity of the building (since its renovation) is 7,000, which includes the Choir area and balcony gallery. The central feature of the tabernacle is the large pipe organ.

During some periods with larger crowds, the performance moves to the LDS Conference Center.

<doc id="1210803" wikidata="Q7855144" url="?curid=1210803" title="Turkey fryer">
<text>A turkey fryer is an apparatus for deep-frying a turkey. Fried turkey has been a popular item in the Southern United States, and has become popular in other parts of the country because of the reduced time needed to cook a turkey in a deep fryer, versus other conventional methods such as an oven or a rotisserie grill.

==History==
An early mention of deep-fried turkey appeared in a 1984 article in the New Orleans &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; and in articles written for the Food sections of the &quot;Baton Rouge Advocate/States Times&quot;, which were attributed to Charlie Gant and two other Cajun friends. Gant said they were sitting around with their crawfish pots after a cochon de lait and wondered what to do with their excess pig lard that would spoil in the Louisiana heat. They came up with deep fried turkeys after trying chickens. Later, because lard spoiled easily, they switched to peanut oil.

==Equipment==
A traditional turkey fryer kit consists of a burner, a large stock pot with lid, a basket and/or poultry holder, a lifter and a thermometer. The burner operates on a standard propane tank that usually must be purchased separately. Current burner units are much lower than the original design so as to increase stability and help prevent tip-overs. Lower cost units use an aluminum stock pot and a steel burner while higher-end units include a stainless steel pot and burner. Some stock pots may have an integrated valve to drain the oil. The poultry holder consists of an aluminum or stainless steel disk with a metal rod formed into a loop with the ends affixed to the center of the disk. The loop is placed through the cavity of the turkey and the lifter is used to lower and remove the turkey. If a basket is used, it includes a bail that is grabbed by the lifter. The thermometer has a long probe and is used to monitor the temperature of the oil. The fryer can also be used to cook other poultry and seafood. The stock pot lid is used to cover the pot only when not actually frying or when preparing other foods by boiling in water. Heavy gloves and an apron are recommended.

Some vendors now offer an add-on temperature control valve. This consists of a valve that goes between the propane tank and the burner and a lead with a thermal sensor. The sensor is placed into the oil and the valve adjusts the flame to achieve a constant temperature.

Electric turkey fryers have been introduced that can be used indoors. Although the electric fryer does not heat up as fast as with propane, it includes a thermostat with a timer and a thermal safety shut-off. Electric fryers can also be used to prepare other foods by frying or boiling.

==Safety==
Deep-frying a turkey uses oil over an open flame, thus it presents some hazards. The operation must be considered hazardous from the time the flame is lit to the time the turkey is removed and the oil is cooled as there&#x27;s a risk for fire, burns, and explosion. A number of homes and other buildings have been destroyed due to the unsafe use of a turkey fryer and Underwriters Laboratories has refused to list turkey fryers.

==Preparation==
The first deep-fried turkey recipes called for cooking 12-15 pound turkeys in lard at 375 degree temperature. Now most recipes, for health reasons, call for lighter oils, even though none of the oils penetrate the turkey because of the heat. Deep-frying requires a cooking oil with a high smoke point such as canola oil, peanut oil, safflower oil or a blend. Cooking time is about four minutes per pound (or about 7 minutes per kilo) of turkey, so a 15-pound turkey needs to be cooked for about one hour in 350 °F (175 °C) oil. Oil can be recovered, stored, and reused several times before it becomes rancid or contaminated. Storage life can be extended by filtering used oil and keeping it cool. A generous rub of salt and pepper may be used to increase flavor. The turkey can also be seasoned with an injectable marinade. Fried turkeys cannot be stuffed, nor do they provide drippings or broth for gravy.

<doc id="1210810" wikidata="Q5106009" url="?curid=1210810" title="Chris Brown (running back)">
<text>Christopher Rejean Brown (born April 17, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Colorado Buffales, earning first-team All-American honors in 2002. He was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the third round of the 2003 NFL draft.

==Early life==
Brown was named &quot;Prep Football Report&quot; and &quot;Super Prep&quot; All-American, first-team All-State, and &quot;Daily Herald&quot; first-team All-Area as senior at Naperville North High School in Naperville, Illinois, rushing for 1,250 yards and 15 touchdowns. He rushed for 2,300 yards and 30 touchdowns in his career at Naperville North, where he played with future Titans teammate Justin McCareins, as well as former Houston Texans defensive back Glenn Earl.

==College career==
Brown was recruited by Gary Barnett at Northwestern University and signed with NU under new coach Randy Walker after Barnett took the Colorado head coaching job. Unhappy with being switched to receiver, Brown left Northwestern after the 1999 season and played a year at Fort Scott Junior College before transferring again to the University of Colorado. At Colorado, Barnett provided him an opportunity to become one of the school&#x27;s all-time leading rushers, including a school record 6 TDs against Nebraska in 2001 during his sophomore season. Brown&#x27;s success continued into 2002, playing himself into a dark-horse Heisman Trophy candidate, before a late-season injury derailed his season and caused him to miss 2 and a half games. To most Colorado fans&#x27; dismay, Brown elected to skip his senior season and enter the NFL draft.

==Professional career==

===Tennessee Titans===
Brown was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the third round of the 2003 NFL Draft, with the 93rd overall selection. As a rookie in 2003, Brown was not available to play during the preseason and five regular season games due to a hamstring injury. Although being behind two other backs, Brown averaged 3.9 yards per carry on 56 carries totaling 221 yards, the Titans&#x27; team high for the 2003 season. He also performed very well in the playoffs.

At the beginning of the 2004 season, Brown was promoted to starting running back due to the absence of Eddie George in the Titans&#x27; lineup. He had a strong start, and finished the season with 1,067 yards, but several injuries forced him to miss significant time and also affected his play. He led the NFL in Yards per carry in 2004.

In January 2005, Brown underwent successful surgery on both ankles. In 2005, Brown ran for 851 yards. Brown has been criticized in the past for running too upright and not running as powerfully as other backs his size. In 2006, the Titans drafted LenDale White, a more traditional power runner, coupled with the emergence of Travis Henry, Brown was deactivated for several games during the 2006 season. Brown completed his contract with the Titans before leaving as a free agent to sign with the Houston Texans.

Brown rushed for a career-high 175 yards against the Jacksonville Jaguars on September 9, 2007.

===Houston Texans===
On March 13, 2008, Brown was signed by the Houston Texans to a two-year deal worth $3.6 million, including an $800,000 signing bonus. Brown played well for the Texans, but his Week 3 fumble, his only of the season, against the Jacksonville Jaguars cost the team a chance to tie a game and force overtime. He also was intercepted on a halfback pass that was a poorly conceived play. Brown completed his two-year contract with the Texans.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Personal life==

Brown is the younger brother of Levelle Brown, fullback formerly of the Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League. Chris has a younger sister named LaShawndra Brown who played Division III basketball. Chris lives in Houston with his wife and three children.

<text>Yalding House is a building at 152–156 Great Portland Street, London, United Kingdom. It was formerly owned by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and from 1952 until 2013 housed the corporation&#x27;s music department.

The BBC Central Music Library was located on the ground floor and basement: the building&#x27;s former role as a car showroom made it ideal for the heavy shelving required to store the collection. The BBC Third Programme, later renamed Radio 3, was also based at Yalding House.

It became the home of BBC Radio 1, together with &quot;Newsbeat&quot;, in 1996 when the Radio 1 studios were moved from Egton House. BBC Radio 1Xtra was launched at Yalding House.

On 14 December 2012, Radio 1 broadcast its last show from Yalding House which was &quot;The Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw&quot;.

<text>Charles Emery Rosendahl (May 15, 1892 – May 17, 1977) was a highly decorated vice admiral in the United States Navy, and an advocate of lighter-than-air flight.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Rosendahl was born in Chicago, Illinois, although his family subsequently relocated to Kansas and Texas and, in 1910, he was appointed to the Naval Academy from the latter state and was later commissioned in the rank of ensign in June 1914, upon graduation from the academy. He was then ordered to join the armored cruiser off Mexico during the Veracruz crisis. After &quot;West Virginia&quot; was decommissioned he served briefly on the battleship and the protected cruiser , before reporting for duty aboard the protected cruiser on May 14, 1915. On September 15, 1916, he returned to the recommissioned &quot;West Virginia&quot;, which was subsequently renamed the &quot;Huntington&quot;. On June 19, 1917, he received promotion to lieutenant (junior grade), and to full lieutenant on August 31, 1918, having served aboard the &quot;Huntington&quot; escorting convoys of troops and supplies to Europe during World War I.

From June 6, 1918, Rosendahl served as an engineering officer, putting the new destroyer into commission. On July 30, 1919, he was ordered to the Pacific Coast for further duty, first serving on the cruiser as gunnery officer, and receiving promotion to lieutenant commander on January 27, 1920. In August he began fitting out new destroyers, commissioning, and delivering them to the fleet; they included the , , , and . On July 11, 1921, Rosendahl assumed command of the destroyer , before being ordered to duty at the Naval Academy as an instructor in Department of Electrical Engineering and Physics in September.

===Move to airships===

When the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Navigation circulated a letter asking for volunteers for rigid airship duty, Rosendahl volunteered. He reported to Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey, to be trained in airship operation on April 7, 1923. Designated a naval aviator in November 1924, Rosendahl served on the dirigible as mooring officer and navigator. Promoted to lieutenant commander on January 5, 1925, he distinguished himself by successfully bringing the bow section of the shattered airship safely to earth after she broke up in the air on September 3, 1925, over Noble County, Ohio. For this action he was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

From March 9, 1926, he served as executive officer, and then as commanding officer from May 10, of the dirigible , making numerous flights for crew training, radio compass station calibration and flight tests for National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). &quot;Los Angeles&quot; also took part in the searches for Nungesser and Coli&#x27;s aircraft &quot;The White Bird&quot;, and Frances Wilson Grayson&#x27;s &quot;Dawn&quot;, both of which went missing during attempts on trans-Atlantic flights.

In January 1928 Rosendahl flew &quot;Los Angeles&quot; out to sea off Newport, Rhode Island, to rendezvous with the aircraft carrier and moored to the ship&#x27;s stern to take on fuel and stores. Further experimental flights were undertaken, mooring to the airship tender during long-range flights.

In July 1928 Rosendahl traveled to Britain to observe their airship activities, and then to Germany for the trials of the airship . In October he was an observer aboard the &quot;Graf&quot; as she made her first Atlantic crossing from Friedrichshafen to Lakehurst.

On May 9, 1929, he was relieved as commanding officer of &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and assumed duty as the commander of the Rigid Airship Training and Experimental Squadron at NAS Lakehurst. In August he was aboard the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;″s &quot;Round the World&quot; flight as observer and watch officer. On June 27, 1930, Rosendahl was assigned to the Bureau of Aeronautics, in Washington, D.C., and from October 21, 1931, to June 23, 1932, commanded the new dirigible , during which time experiments in the role as an airborne aircraft carrier were tried. Between July 1932 and June 1934 Rosendahl served at sea on board the battleship and heavy cruiser .

On June 11, 1934, he assumed command at NAS Lakehurst, and was promoted to commander on February 1, 1935. Rosendahl served as an official observer on the German airship , on transatlantic flights between Frankfurt and Rio de Janeiro in August and September 1936. He was in command at Lakehurst on the night of May 6, 1937, and witnessed the destruction of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, leading fire fighting and rescue efforts. He later testified at the Department of Commerce inquiry into the accident and stated:

On August 6, 1938, he was relieved of command of NAS Lakehurst, and on August 31, he reported to Pearl Harbor to serve as executive officer of the light cruiser .

On May 23, 1940, he was assigned to the office of the Secretary of the Navy for duty in airship evaluations, and was promoted to the rank of captain on July 13. In September he became the senior member of the board created to investigate sites for new airship stations. On February 25, 1941, he was detached from that duty to serve in the office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and then on April 23, 1942, to the office of Chief of Naval Operations, under the Director of Fleet Training, for airship training and base selection.

===World War II===

On September 6, 1942, Rosendahl took command of the heavy cruiser . The ship was torpedoed during the Battle of Tassafaronga, off Guadalcanal, on November 30, 1942, losing of her bows and had three of four boilers knocked out. Rosendahl kept her afloat and reached the safety of Tulagi. For this action he was subsequently awarded the Navy Cross. On May 15, he returned to NAS Lakehurst and assumed duty as the Chief of Naval Airship Training Command, receiving promotion to rear admiral on May 26, 1943. This service lasted through World War II, until he retired on November 1, 1946. He was advanced to the rank of vice admiral on the same day.

===Post-Navy activities===
Between 1947 and 1952 Rosendahl was an aeronautical consultant and a vice-president of the Flettner Aircraft Corporation, New York. In 1953 he was appointed executive director of the National Air Transport Coordinating Committee, a group set up to study air transport problems in the greater New York area after three crashes in Elizabeth, New Jersey, during 1952.

Rosendahl retired to Toms River, New Jersey, in 1960 to write and to organize the Lighter-Than-Air Museum Association at Lakehurst. The Navy conditionally deeded land to the LTA Museum Association, but because the group was unsuccessful in raising funds, the land reverted to NAS Lakehurst.

The United States Navy ended airship operations in August 1962. Rosendahl was aboard the N class blimp &quot;ZPG-3W&quot; on the final flight.

Rosendahl died on May 17, 1977, at the Naval Hospital Philadelphia.

==Personal life==
On June 30, 1932, he met Jean Wilson on a train en route to Los Angeles, California. They were married on December 22, 1934.

<doc id="1210837" wikidata="Q3498945" url="?curid=1210837" title="Steve Hanke">
<text>Steve H. Hanke (; born December 29, 1942) is an American economist and professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He is also a senior fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, California, and co-director of the Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise in Baltimore, Maryland.

Hanke is known for his work as a currency reformer in emerging-market countries. He was a senior economist with President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers from 1981 to 1982, and has served as an adviser to heads of state in countries throughout Asia, South America, Europe, and the Middle East. He is also known for his work on currency boards, dollarization, hyperinflation, water pricing and demand, benefit-cost analysis, privatization, and other topics in applied economics. He has written extensively as a columnist for &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;The National Review&quot;, and other publications. He is also a currency and commodity trader.

Hanke has been accused of spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of his critique of the effectiveness of lockdowns, as well as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and was listed as a Russian propagandist by Ukraine&#x27;s Center for Countering Disinformation.

==Early life and education==
Hanke was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1942 and grew up in Atlantic, Iowa, where he attended Atlantic High School. He then attended the University of Colorado Boulder in Boulder, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Hanke earned a B.S. in business administration (1964) and a Ph.D. in economics (1969) from the University of Colorado.

==Academic career==
Hanke&#x27;s first academic appointment was at the Colorado School of Mines in 1966, when he was 24. During this time, Hanke developed and taught courses in mineral and petroleum economics, while completing his Ph.D. dissertation on the impact of meter installation on municipal water demand. Hanke then joined the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University, where he initially specialized in water resource economics. After six years at Johns Hopkins, including a one-year visiting professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, Hanke attained the rank of full professor within the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Whiting School of Engineering, one of the fastest promotions to that rank in the school&#x27;s history. At present, Hanke teaches courses in applied economics and finance that are widely recognized as a gateway for Hopkins students to gain employment on Wall Street.

Over the course of his career, Hanke has held editorial positions with a number of academic journals, including the &quot;Journal of Economic Policy Reform&quot;; &quot;Water Resources Research&quot;; &quot;Land Economics&quot;; and &quot;Water Engineering and Management&quot;. He currently holds editorial positions with &quot;The International Economy&quot;, &quot;The Independent Review&quot;, &quot;Cato Journal&quot;, &quot;Review of Austrian Economics&quot;, &quot;Economic Journal Watch&quot;, and &quot;Central Banking&quot;. In 1995, Hanke and Johns Hopkins University history professor Louis Galambos founded the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health and Study of Business Enterprise. Hanke is also a senior fellow and director of the Troubled Currencies Project at the Cato Institute, a special counselor to the Center for Financial Stability, and a member of the Charter Council of the Society for Economic Measurement. Hanke is a senior advisor at Renmin University&#x27;s International Monetary Research Institute, in association with Nobel laureate Robert Mundell (1932—2021) of Columbia.

===Water resource economics===
In 1969, Hanke began his academic career as a water resource economist in the Johns Hopkins Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering (now the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering), a department founded by famed sanitary engineer Abel Wolman. At the time, the department was known as the premier water resource engineering department in the country, and was home to world-renowned sanitary engineer John C. Geyer, with whom Hanke would frequently collaborate. Hanke was hired to continue the water-related research program at Johns Hopkins that began during the Geyer era. During his initial years in the department, Hanke focused on issues including water pricing and demand, benefit-cost analysis, system design, and leak detection and control. He produced a number of important pieces of scholarship, including the first event study of the impact of water meter installation on water use, as well as sewer interceptor design criteria which are still commonly used today in Europe.

During this time, Hanke served as the associate editor of the &quot;Water Resources Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Water Resources Research&quot;, as the economics editor for &quot;Water Engineering and Management&quot;, and as a member of the editorial board of &quot;Land Economics&quot;. He was also an adviser to the French water companies Compagnie Générale des Eaux (now Veolia Environment) and Compagnie Lyonnaise des Eaux, as well as to the engineering firms Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in Australia, and Binnie &amp; Partners in London. In 1981, Hanke was appointed a senior economist with the president&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers, where his responsibilities included the Reagan White House&#x27;s water portfolio. While at the CEA, Hanke led a team that re-wrote the federal government&#x27;s Principles and Guidelines for Water and Land Related Resources Implementation Studies, to include more rigorous benefit-cost analysis requirements. Hanke continues to be active in the water resources field, focusing primarily on municipal water system privatization. He is a member of the Johns Hopkins University Global Water Program.

===Privatization===
Hanke has produced eight books and numerous articles and proposals dealing with the privatization of public-sector resources. In 1972, he was a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya, where he worked with anthropologist and conservationist Richard Leakey on the economics of big game cropping and hunting, as well as the privatization of big game reserves to combat poaching. Hanke also worked with Barney Dowdle of the University of Washington and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of Lincoln County, Oregon, on a proposal to privatize portions of their reservation, as a means of improving economic opportunity on Native American reservations. While at the White House, Hanke worked closely with his long-time associate, CEA member William A. Niskanen. He was known as a member of the supply-side economics movement within the Reagan administration. It was during this time that Hanke was noted for developing United States Ronald Reagan&#x27;s program for privatizing public assets and services, particularly municipal water systems, and public grazing and timber lands. This plan was endorsed by one of Reagan&#x27;s closest allies, the then Nevada senator Paul Laxalt, among others.

Hanke&#x27;s work to privatize public lands put him at odds with Secretary of the Interior James Watt and members of the Sagebrush Rebellion, who sought to transfer federal public lands to state control, rather than to private ownership. In 1982, Hanke left the CEA, joining a number of influential Reagan administration supply-siders, including Martin Anderson, Norman B. Ture, and Paul Craig Roberts. In 1984, Hanke was appointed a senior adviser to the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, where he advised Senators Steve Symms and Paul Laxalt on privatization. Although the English term &quot;reprivatisation&quot; first appeared in &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine in the 1930s, and subsequently in various academic journals, Hanke and his wife, Liliane, are often credited with popularizing the term &quot;privatization&quot; – derived from the French term &quot;privatise&quot; – in the American economic lexicon during the 1980s, as well as for bringing about its inclusion in Merriam-Webster&#x27;s &quot;Collegiate Dictionary&quot;. Hanke has authored numerous articles on the subject of privatization, including the entry for &quot;Privatization&quot; in the 1987 edition of &quot;The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics&quot;.

===Currency boards and dollarization===
After Hong Kong reinstated its currency board in 1983, Hanke began to collaborate with his fellow Johns Hopkins professor, and Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, on the subject of currency boards. A currency board is a monetary authority that issues a local currency that is fully backed by a foreign reserve currency, and which is freely convertible with the foreign reserve currency at a fixed exchange rate. Walters was a key advocate of the reestablishment of Hong Kong&#x27;s currency board. Hanke and Walters established a currency board research program at Johns Hopkins. One of Hanke&#x27;s first post-doctoral fellows in that program was Kurt Schuler. Shortly after Schuler&#x27;s arrival at Johns Hopkins, Hanke and Schuler discovered that John Maynard Keynes was an advocate of currency boards. Hanke and Schuler presented these findings, including original documentation, in a book edited by Walters and Hanke.

During this time, Hanke began conducting research on dollarization, whereby a country replaces its domestic currency with a stable foreign currency – creating a de facto fixed-exchange-rate monetary system between two countries. Over the course of his career, Hanke has written over 20 books and monographs and over 300 articles on currency boards and dollarization. Many of these were written in collaboration with Kurt Schuler. Hanke also co-authored with Sir Alan Walters the entry for &quot;Currency Boards&quot; in the 1992 edition of &quot;The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance&quot;. In addition, he played a central role in drafting and bringing about the inclusion of the Hanke Amendment in the 1993 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. This measure, sponsored by Senators Phil Graham, Bob Dole, Connie Mack, Jesse Helms, and Steve Symms allowed U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund to be used for the purpose of establishing currency boards.

===Hyperinflation===
Hanke has written extensively on the subject of hyperinflation, which describes when a country&#x27;s inflation rate exceeds 50% per month. In 2008, Hanke and Alex Kwok published a paper, which estimated that Zimbabwe&#x27;s hyperinflation peaked in November 2008 at %. This makes Zimbabwe&#x27;s hyperinflation the second-highest in history – peaking 3.5 months after the Mugabe government stopped reporting inflation statistics, and 1.5 months after the IMF&#x27;s last estimate of Zimbabwe&#x27;s inflation rate, with a peak inflation rate 30 million times higher than the last official rate.

Hanke employs a methodology, based on the principle of purchasing power parity, which allows him to accurately estimate inflation in countries with very high inflation rates. Using this methodology, Hanke and his collaborators discovered several cases of hyperinflation that had previously gone unreported in the academic literature and popular press. These include the 1923 hyperinflation episode in the Free City of Danzig, and 21st-century suspected cases in North Korea (2011) and Iran (2012). In 2012, Hanke and Nicholas Krus documented 56 cases of hyperinflation that have occurred in history, in &quot;World Hyperinflations&quot;, a chapter in the &quot;Routledge Handbook of Major Events in Economic History&quot;. Since then, Hanke has documented two additional cases of hyperinflation: one occurred in Venezuela in 2016, and the other occurred in Zimbabwe in 2017. In 2013, Hanke founded the Troubled Currencies Project, a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins University and the Cato Institute, in order to track exchange-rate and inflation data in countries including Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela.

===Monetary analysis===
Hanke&#x27;s views on monetary policy are influenced by his experience as a currency and commodities trader, as well as by the economics of Milton Friedman, Robert Mundell, and Friedrich Hayek. Hanke is a proponent of Divisia monetary aggregates, originated by William A. Barnett of the University of Kansas and the Center for Financial Stability. Barnett&#x27;s derivation uses the Divisia quantity index formula of  Francois Divisia with the monetary-assets user-cost-price formula derived by Barnett (1980). Hanke also favors broad monetary aggregates as articulated by economists, including Tim Congdon. Hanke argues that changes in nominal national income are a function of changes in broad money aggregates.

In 2012, Hanke developed a method of monetary analysis known as state-money/bank-money analysis (SMBMA). This methodology is based on John Maynard Keynes&#x27; distinction between money produced by a central bank (&quot;state money&quot;) and money produced via the private banking sector, through deposit creation (&quot;bank money&quot;), contained in the 1930 classic &quot;A Treatise on Money&quot;. Hanke has employed SMBMA as a method of analyzing the response of various countries to the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, Hanke has employed SMBMA for the United States, the United Kingdom, and various countries in the European Union to study the pro-cyclical effects of higher capital-asset ratios implemented during economic downturns. Hanke has been an outspoken critic of pro-cyclical capital requirements imposed under Basel III, Dodd–Frank, and other financial regulatory regimes. He is also on the advisory board of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) in London, where he regularly contributes to the OMFIF&#x27;s &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and is involved in meetings regarding financial and monetary systems.

=== Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar ===

Hanke and his colleague Richard Conn Henry, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Physics and Astronomy, developed the Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar, which aims to reform the current Gregorian calendar by making every year identical; it also integrates the abolition of time zones. With the Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar, every calendar date would always fall on the same day of the week. Some of the advantages would include a permanent day of the week for all holidays; a simplification of financial calculations, and it would not draw criticism from religious groups because it retains the Sabbath.

==Economic advising and currency reform==
Hanke began advising political leaders on economic issues in the late 1970s, when he served as a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers for the State of Maryland, along with Carl Christ and Clopper Almon. After stints at the president&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers, the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, and the president&#x27;s Task Force on Project Economic Justice during the Reagan administration, Hanke began advising heads of state in developing countries on a &quot;pro-bono&quot; basis. Hanke has advised five presidents (Bulgaria, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and Montenegro); five cabinet ministers (Albania, Argentina, Ecuador, Yugoslavia, and the United Arab Emirates); and has held two cabinet-level positions (Lithuania and Montenegro).

As the fall of Soviet regimes and the Soviet ruble began to spark currency crises throughout the former Soviet Union, Hanke began to work as an economic adviser to a number of heads of state in newly independent countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. In 1998, under Hanke&#x27;s leadership, Friedberg Mercantile Group, Inc. was one of the few trading shops to predict the devaluation of the Russian ruble. Hanke predicted that the devaluation would occur after mid-year, and the ruble collapsed shortly thereafter, on August 17, 1998. In collaboration with his then-post-doctoral student, Kurt Schuler, Hanke developed a blueprint for a currency board reform package, which he proposed in a number of countries throughout the 1990s, including Albania, Argentina, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Estonia, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Montenegro, Russia, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.

===Argentina===
In 1989, Hanke met Argentine President Carlos Menem, who connected Hanke and his wife, Liliane, with the right-wing libertarian faction in the Argentine Congress led by Alvaro Alsogaray, for the purpose of developing a currency reform that would end Argentina&#x27;s inflation problems. Hanke was an early proponent of a currency board system for Argentina, which he outlined in a 1991 book. The book, &quot;¿Banco Central O Caja de Conversión?&quot; was co-authored by Kurt Schuler and included a preface by Argentine Congressman José María Ibarbia, who was a member of the Alsogaray faction. Later, Hanke worked closely with Menem and members of the Argentine Congress to implement a currency board, along the general lines of Hanke and Schuler&#x27;s original proposal. The result was not an orthodox currency board, but rather a &quot;convertibility system&quot;, passed in the Convertibility Law of 1991, which ended Argentina&#x27;s hyperinflation episode.

During the 1989 to 1991 period, Hanke worked closely with Congressman José María Ibarbia and his colleagues (the Alsogaray faction) in the Argentine Congress to develop a blueprint for a currency board system. That blueprint was published in Buenos Aires and contains a preface written by José María Ibarbia. Following Hanke and Sir Alan Walters&#x27; 1994 prediction of the Mexican peso&#x27;s collapse, Argentine Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo invited Hanke to serve as his adviser. During this time, Hanke&#x27;s primary role was to leverage his scholarship and experience as one of the experts who was in the middle of the currency reform debates before the adoption of the convertibility system – as well as his credibility established when he predicted the tequila crisis – to explain how the convertibility system operated at the time, and to restore confidence in Argentina and the peso&#x27;s international credibility. At the time, Hanke was described by Argentine newspapers as &quot;Cavallo&#x27;s spokesman&quot;, as well as the &quot;generator of confidence&quot; in the Argentine economy.

Argentina&#x27;s convertibility system differed in several key respects from Hanke&#x27;s original proposal. In October 1991, the year the system was implemented, Hanke warned in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed that the convertibility system could begin to function as a central bank, and eventually collapse. This prediction came true in the late 1990s, as the Argentine convertibility system began to function like a central bank and engage in sterilization. Hanke wrote many articles showing that the convertibility system was not a currency board. As the convertibility system began to falter, Carlos Menem, on Hanke&#x27;s advice, proposed dollarization for Argentina – first in 1995 and again in January 1999. In February 1999, Menem asked Hanke to prepare a dollarization blueprint for Argentina. This proposal was never acted upon, and the convertibility system ultimately collapsed in 2002.

===Yugoslavia and Albania===
In January 1990, Hanke was appointed the personal economic adviser to Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zivko Pregl. Although Pregl was at one point a leader of the Communist League of Yugoslavia, he sought Hanke&#x27;s counsel on ways to liberalize Yugoslavia&#x27;s socialist economy. During this time, Hanke proposed a number of free-market reforms, including the privatization of Yugoslavia&#x27;s pension system, as well as a currency board system to address the failing Yugoslav dinar.

In 1991, the Ekonomski Institute Beograd published a book, in the Serbo-Croatian language, which Hanke and Schuler co-authored. The book laid out the details about what would have been a Yugoslav currency board. However, these efforts were suspended when the Yugoslav civil war broke out and Pregl resigned in June 1991. After the war broke out, Hanke continued his involvement in the Balkans, working with Deloitte &amp; Touche&#x27;s Eastern European division to establish new Deloitte offices and bring traditional financial accounting to the formerly communist country. That same year, Hanke also began advising Albanian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Gramoz Pashko on the possibility of establishing a currency board in Albania. The proposal was contained in Hanke and Kurt Schuler&#x27;s 1991 monograph &quot;A Currency Board Solution for the Albanian Lek&quot;, published by the International Freedom Foundation. The proposal was never acted upon.

===Bulgaria===
In 1990, Hanke anticipated Bulgaria&#x27;s 1991 hyperinflation episode and began designing a currency board system for Bulgaria. He incorporated this proposal into a monograph co-authored with Kurt Schuler. The monograph, &quot;Teeth for the Bulgarian Lev: A Currency Board Solution&quot; was published in 1991. Hanke continued his work on a Bulgarian currency board, periodically visiting Sofia throughout the early 1990s. In late 1996, Hanke and Schuler&#x27;s currency reform handbook &quot;Currency Boards for Developing Countries&quot; gained popularity when a pirated Bulgarian-language version of the book became a best-seller in Sofia. In 1997, during Bulgaria&#x27;s second episode of hyperinflation, Hanke was appointed as an adviser to Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, and worked to bring about the establishment of Bulgaria&#x27;s currency board. Inspired by the original Hanke-Schuler blueprint, members of the Bulgarian government drafted a law which converted the Bulgarian National Bank to a currency board system. Acting in his capacity as Stoyanov&#x27;s adviser, Hanke continued to be deeply involved in fine-tuning and steering his idea to full adoption, throughout the drafting, legislative, and implementation process.

Bulgaria adopted the proposal and installed the currency board on July 1, 1997. The currency board linked the lev to the German Deutsche Mark, and later the euro. Upon adoption, the Bulgarian Currency Board immediately put an end to the country&#x27;s 1997 hyperinflation episode. Hanke continued to serve as President Stoyanov&#x27;s adviser until the end of his term in 2002. Hanke remains active in Bulgaria, as a vocal supporter of the currency board, the country&#x27;s flat tax, and anti-corruption measures. He frequently contributes to the Bulgarian publications &quot;Capital&quot;, &quot;Trud&quot; and &quot;Novinite&quot;, among others. In 2013, Hanke&#x27;s work on the Bulgarian currency board was praised by Bulgarian Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences awarded Hanke a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot;. And in 2015, Varna Free University awarded Hanke the title doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot;, in honor of his scholarship on currency boards and his reform efforts in Bulgaria. In 2018, the D. A. Tsenov Academy of Economics awarded Hanke a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; in honor of Hanke&#x27;s work as the father of the Bulgarian currency board.

===Estonia===
In 1992, Hanke, Kurt Schuler, and Lars Jonung – then a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics – released a book in both English and Estonian containing a blueprint for an Estonian currency board. After Jonung was appointed chief economic advisor to Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, in 1992, Jonung convinced Bildt to embrace the idea of a currency board for Estonia and arrange for its presentation to the Estonian government. In May 1992, Hanke presented the currency board blueprint to members of Estonia&#x27;s Constituent Assembly in Tallinn. One month later, in June 1992, Estonia adopted a monetary system based on the Hanke-Jonung-Schuler proposal. Estonia thus abandoned the Soviet ruble and began issuing its own currency, linking the Estonian kroon to the German Mark at a fixed exchange rate. Following the introduction of the euro, the kroon was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2011, when Estonia officially adopted the euro as its currency.

===Lithuania===
In the early 1990s, George Selgin, Joseph Sinkey Jr., and Kurt Schuler began working with Elena Leontjeva of the Lithuanian Free Market Institute (LFMI) on a reform proposal for Lithuania&#x27;s central bank. Later, Hanke also began collaborating with the LFMI during regular visits to Vilnius. Having witnessed the positive effects of neighboring Estonia&#x27;s currency board, Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Šleževičius, met with Hanke and his wife Liliane over lunch in January 1994 to discuss the possibility of a currency reform package for Lithuania. During that meeting, Šleževičius appointed Hanke a state counselor – a cabinet-level appointment – and tasked him with designing a currency board system for Lithuania.

The LFMI immediately arranged for Hanke and Schuler to publish a book in Lithuanian, &quot;Valiutu Taryba: Pasiulymai Lietuvai&quot;. Their book contained a currency board blueprint for the country. This measure was adopted in April 1994, linking the Lithuanian litas to the German Mark at a fixed exchange rate. Following the introduction of the euro, the litas was linked to the euro, until January 1, 2015, when Lithuania officially adopted the euro as its currency.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Influenced by the 1991 Hanke-Schuler book proposing a currency board for Yugoslavia, the 1995 Dayton Agreement required Bosnia and Herzegovina to employ a currency board for at least six years. In the aftermath of the Yugoslav civil war, local officials and an IMF team set about to create a central bank for Bosnia and Herzegovina based on the principles of a currency board. Hanke began serving as a special adviser to the U.S. government in December 1996 and was tasked with ensuring that the central bank law resulted in a currency board system that was as orthodox as possible.

Shortly after his appointment, Hanke published a critique of the IMF currency board proposal. Warren Coats, a key member of the IMF team discussed Hanke&#x27;s involvement at length in a 2007 book. In a section of the book titled &quot;Steve Hanke&quot;, Coats recounts:

===Indonesia===
In August 1997, upon urging from the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia adopted a floating exchange rate for its currency, the rupiah. In the ensuing months, the rupiah weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar. Inflation in Indonesia began to accelerate, sparking food riots across the country. In February 1998, Indonesian President Suharto invited Hanke to serve as his economic adviser. On the day of Hanke&#x27;s appointment as special counselor and a member of Indonesia&#x27;s Economic and Monetary Resilience Council, the rupiah appreciated by 28% against the U.S. dollar. During his time as Suharto&#x27;s adviser, Hanke had an unprecedented level of access to the Indonesian president and even played a role in the dismissal of Indonesia&#x27;s Central Bank governor.

Hanke recommended that Indonesia institute an orthodox currency board, linking the rupiah to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate. Hanke supported the reforms contained in the IMF&#x27;s package. But, he argued that the IMF&#x27;s program would fail unless it was coupled with a currency board arrangement. Hanke referred to his alternative reform package for Indonesia as &quot;IMF Plus&quot;. It garnered the support of notable economists, including Gary Becker, Rudiger Dornbusch, Milton Friedman, Merton Miller, Robert Mundell, and Sir Alan Walters. Hanke was also named one of the 25 most influential people in the world by &quot;World Trade Magazine&quot; during this time.

In 1998, during his annual accountability speech, Suharto announced his intention to adopt Hanke&#x27;s currency board proposal. This plan was met with opposition by the governments of Germany, Japan, and Singapore, among others. Some economists including Nouriel Roubini and Paul Krugman criticized Hanke&#x27;s proposal. The fiercest resistance, however, came from the IMF and from U.S. President Bill Clinton – who threatened to withdraw $43 billion in aid if Indonesia adopted Hanke&#x27;s proposal.

Later, officials including former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, as well as former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, conceded that criticism of Hanke&#x27;s proposal did not stem from opposition to the economics of Hanke&#x27;s proposal, but rather out of concern that a stable rupiah would thwart U.S.-led efforts to oust Suharto. As Nobel laureate Merton Miller recalled in 1999, the objection to Hanke&#x27;s proposal was &quot;not that it wouldn&#x27;t work but that it would, and if it worked, they would be stuck with Suharto.&quot; Under intense international pressure, Suharto ultimately reversed course and abandoned Hanke&#x27;s &quot;IMF Plus&quot; proposal. On May 21, 1998, amid continued currency problems, as well as protests and reports of a brewing military coup, Suharto resigned as president of Indonesia.

===Montenegro===
In 1999, Hanke and Montenegrin economist Željko Bogetić, who was an economist at the IMF at the time, wrote &quot;Crnogorska marka&quot;, a book published in Montenegro, proposing an orthodox currency board for Montenegro, which was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegro would issue a Montenegrin &quot;marka&quot; to replace the Yugoslav dinar. Later that year in July 1999, Hanke was appointed state counselor – a cabinet-level position – and began advising Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović on issues including currency reform. After assessing the political and economic realities on the ground, Hanke advised Đukanović that Montenegro should abandon the faltering Yugoslav dinar and adopt a foreign currency, the German Mark, as its own. This process is known as dollarization.

In 1999, Montenegro was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, along with Serbia. Đukanović began pursuing Hanke&#x27;s dollarization proposal for both economic and political reasons. In addition to providing relief from high inflation, dollarization also promised Montenegro the ability to pursue economic – and ultimately political – independence from Serbia. In late 1999, Montenegro introduced the German Mark as an official currency. In late 2000, the Yugoslav dinar was officially dropped, making the Deutsche Mark the sole legal tender in Montenegro.

===Ecuador===
Hanke was an early proponent of currency boards and later dollarization in Ecuador. In 1995, Hanke and Kurt Schuler published a currency board blueprint in Spanish that was widely circulated in Ecuador. In May 1996, Hanke traveled to Ecuador to encourage then-presidential candidate Abdalá Bucaram to pursue a currency board for Ecuador. Shortly thereafter, Bucaram raised the idea of a currency board while on the campaign trail. Following Bucaram&#x27;s election, Hanke presented a dollarization proposal to members of the Ecuadorian government.

By February 1997, Bucaram had been removed from office on insanity charges, and the dollarization idea lay dormant. In 1999, Ecuador&#x27;s currency, the sucre, collapsed, losing 75% of its value against the U.S. dollar from the start of 1999 until the first week of January 2000. Shortly thereafter, Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad resurrected the dollarization idea. On January 9, 2000, he announced that Ecuador would abandon the sucre and officially adopt the U.S. dollar, putting an end to Ecuador&#x27;s high inflation. In 2001, Hanke was appointed adviser to Ecuador&#x27;s Minister of Finance and Economy, to assist with the implementation of dollarization. In 2003, Hanke was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Arts by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and in 2004, he was named professor asociado by the Universidad del Azuay in Cuenca, Ecuador, in honor of his reform efforts in Ecuador and scholarship on dollarization.

==Currency and commodity trading==
Hanke has been trading commodities and currencies for over 60 years. He has also trained a number of Johns Hopkins students who have gone on to successful careers in finance. He is chairman emeritus of the Friedberg Mercantile Group, Inc. in Toronto. During the 1990s, he served as president of Toronto Trust Argentina (TTA) in Buenos Aires. It was the world best performing mutual fund in 1995. Hanke also serves on the supervisory board of AMG (Advanced Metallurgical Group, N.V.), which was the best performing stock on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 2017, with its market capitalization increasing by 201%. In May 2019, Hanke was appointed chairman of AMG&#x27;s supervisory board. In the past, he has served on the board of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the National Bank of Kuwait&#x27;s International Advisory Board, which was chaired by Sir John Major.

In 1995, during the Mexican tequila crisis, many investors were shying away from Argentine investments. Relying on his deep understanding of the convertibility system, Hanke bet against the market and had TTA fully invested in Argentine peso-denominated bonds. As a result, TTA was the world&#x27;s best performing mutual fund in 1995, with a 79.25% increase. Hanke has taken several other notable successful trading positions during his career. For example, in late 1985, he was among the first to correctly predict that oil would fall below $10 per barrel, and in 1993, he joined a successful speculative attack on the French franc, which elicited an article in &quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;Scenario-fiction Pour Une Journée De Cocagne: Hunt, Hanke, Goldsmith Tsutsumi Et Les Autres...&quot;.

Hanke has worked as an expert witness in financial litigation, specializing in derivatives cases. In the past, he was a principal at Chicago Partners (now Navigant Consulting). In 1994, Hanke, his then-post-doctoral student Christopher Culp, and Nobel laureate Merton Miller waded into the debate over the collapse of Metallgesellschaft AG. Although not officially involved in the case, Hanke, Culp, and Miller made headlines when they revealed that Metallgesellschaft&#x27;s oil futures hedge was sound, and that it was Deutsche Bank who was responsible for the collapse of the $1.3 billion position.

==Criticism==

=== Currency board ===
In the article &quot;Rupiah Rasputin&quot; written in 1998 for &quot;Fortune&quot;, Paul Krugman said that Hanke had inflated his connection to former Argentine Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo and quoted the latter as saying that Hanke had only volunteered as a publicist. Krugman also argued that creating a currency board in Indonesia &quot;was probably a bad idea right now&quot;, because it would interfere with payments for imports or debt service.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
In June 2020, Hanke wrongly tweeted that Vietnam was among the &quot;rotten apples&quot; of COVID-19 data after misattributing the country&#x27;s zero death count as &quot;No Data Reported&quot;. After much outcry on social media and a petition to Johns Hopkins University signed by nearly 300 Vietnamese academics demanding an apology, Hanke issued a correction on Twitter stating that the country has a &quot;perfect&quot; record in its fight against COVID-19; the original tweet was also deleted. In an interview with Voice of America following the controversy, Hanke described Vietnam&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic was &quot;excellent&quot;, and he cited the country&#x27;s poor record of press freedom as reasons behind his initial suspicion of its coronavirus data.

In January 2022, Hanke co-authored a working paper arguing that lockdowns had &quot;little to no effect on COVID-19 mortality&quot; but had &quot;devastating&quot; effects on society. It was cited by American conservative news website Fox News, which stated that &quot;lockdowns should be rejected out of hand&quot;. The paper was criticized as being &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; by various medical experts, including PolitiFact, and labelled as &quot;misleading&quot; by fact checker Health Feedback, while epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz tweeted that it was &quot;a very weird review paper&quot;. PolitiFact concluded that Hanke had &quot;repeatedly elevated false claims about the pandemic&quot;, citing his previous remark on Twitter, which stated that national lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccine policies are &quot;fascist&quot;. An op-ed on the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also called the paper &quot;as scientific as a Joe Rogan rant&quot;. An article on &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; criticized Hanke&#x27;s &quot;appalling pseudo-science&quot; and described him as an economist fighting a &quot;war against public health&quot;.

In February 2022, Hanke shared a video showing a man on fire and claimed he was protesting the Italian government&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine mandates. A fact check by Reuters refuted the claim and concluded that the incident had &quot;nothing to do with COVID-19&quot;. The family of the man also released a statement condemning speculation about links to vaccination..

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hanke has voiced opposition to the sanctions against Russia, calling them &quot;for losers&quot;. In October 2022, the Center for Countering Disinformation, an agency within the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, placed Hanke on its &quot;blacklist&quot; of Russian propagandists.

In December 2022, Hanke shared a video on Twitter purportedly showing Slovaks protested against their government&#x27;s support for Ukraine and &quot;the heavy burden it&#x27;s imposing on them&quot;. The video was later revealed to be from an unrelated demonstration in 2018 following the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. Hanke&#x27;s tweet was later deleted after outcry on social media and criticisms from multiple Slovak media outlets accusing him of spreading misinformation about the war in Ukraine. Hanke was also condemned by former CNN Norway&#x27;s managing director Morten Øverbye, as well as Miroslav Wlachovský, the foreign policy adviser to Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger.

<text>William Chase Richardson (May 11, 1940 – May 18, 2021) received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College (Connecticut) and a Master in Business Administration degree (1964) and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago (1971).

Dr Richardson was previously graduate dean and vice provost for research at the University of Washington (1981-1984), executive vice president and provost at Pennsylvania State University (1984–1990), and held various positions at the University of Chicago. He later became president of Johns Hopkins University (1990–1995). Dr Richardson devoted his academic career to researching the financing and organization of health services in the USA.

While at Johns Hopkins, Richardson made efforts to update the curriculum, diversify the student body and faculty, increase cooperation between academic divisions, and secure the school&#x27;s financial position. Enrollment increased by 1995 to a record 16,330 and a new capital campaign launched, intended to raise $900 million. African-American and Hispanic enrollment doubled in his five years as president.

Dr Richardson left academia to head the Kellogg Foundation (1995–2005) and became chair and co-trustee of The Kellogg Foundation Trust (1996–2007). Dr Richardson has also been a director on the boards of the Kellogg Company (1996–2007), the Bank of New York (1998–2007), Exelon Corporation (2005-2016), CSX Corporation (1992–2008), and Mercantile Bankshares. He was succeeded at the Kellogg Foundation in January 2006 by Sterling Speirn.

He was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences in 1981. He is best known for his role as chair of the groundbreaking report on medical errors (&quot;To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System&quot;) and a following report on quality of health care in America (&quot;Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century&quot;). He won its David Rall Award in 2007. (The David Rall Medal is awarded to a member of the Institute of Medicine who has demonstrated particularly distinguished leadership as a chair of a study committee or other such activities in a manner that was particularly exemplary, demonstrating a commitment substantially above and beyond the usual expectations of a committee chair.)

<text>Victor Harold Schroeder (born February 16, 1944) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1979 to 1988, and a senior cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1981 to 1988.

==Education==
Schroeder was born on February 16, 1944 to a Mennonite family in Altona, Manitoba. The son of Henry Schroeder and Anna Braun, he was educated at Mennonite Collegiate Institute in Gretna, Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba.

==Career==
He worked as a lawyer before entering public life, and was a member of the Manitoba Securities Commission as well as serving as a vice-chairman of the Manitoba Public Utilities Board. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in a 1972 by-election in the Winnipeg riding of Wolseley, finishing third against Manitoba Liberal Party leader Izzy Asper. In 1967, he married Leona Esther Thiesson.

Schroeder contested another by-election in 1979, this time in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Rossmere, recently vacated by former premier Edward Schreyer upon his appointment at Governor General of Canada. The election was surprisingly close, with Schroeder defeating Progressive Conservative Harold Piercy by only 230 votes. Following his victory, Schroeder supported Howard Pawley&#x27;s successful bid to become party leader. He was re-elected by a greater margin in the provincial election of 1981.

The NDP formed a majority government following this election, and Schroeder was appointed minister of finance and Minister of Labour and Manpower on November 30, 1981, also carrying responsibility for the Civil Service Commission and Civil Service Superannuation Board and the administration of Pension Benefits Act and Public Servants Insurance Act. On July 19, 1982, he was relieved of all cabinet responsibilities except for the Finance portfolio.

=== Other jobs ===
While retaining Finance, he also served as Chairman of the Treasury Board from July 28, 1982, to November 4, 1983, and as minister responsible for Manitoba Data Services from August 20, 1982, to November 4, 1983. On November 4, 1983, he was named Minister of Crown Investments and given responsibility for the Civil Service a second time. On January 5, 1984, he was also given responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation Act. He was relieved of his Civil Service responsibilities on January 30, 1985.

=== 1986 election ===
In the provincial election of 1986, he defeated Tory candidate Harold Neufeld by 527 votes.

Following the election, on April 17, 1986, he was relieved of the Finance portfolio, retained in the Crown Investments portfolio and also named Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology. From May 20 to August 29, 1986, he also served as Minister of Energy and Mines, responsible for Manitoba Hydro. On February 4, 1987, he was relieved of the Crown Investments portfolio and given responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation. Finally, on September 21, 1987, he was given the additional portfolio of attorney general.

The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, and Schroeder lost to Neufeld by 526 votes in the election which followed.
== Career after politics ==
Schroeder was appointed as the chair of Manitoba Hydro in 2000, by the NDP government of Gary Doer. During his time as chairman, wind power was incorporated into the utility&#x27;s power production. Schroeder retired as chairman in February 2012.

<text>James William Charles Moir (born 5 November 1941) is a retired British television and radio producer and executive. He was a senior BBC executive for many years until his retirement in 2003. 

==Early life==
Moir attended Gunnersbury Catholic Grammar School (now Gunnersbury Boys&#x27; School). He studied History at the University of Nottingham, where he joined the Entertainments Society (Ensoc), taking part in drama productions.

==Career==
Moir joined the BBC in 1963, as a production assistant in light entertainment. Among the programmes he later produced were &quot;Bruce Forsyth and the Generation Game&quot; from 1971-75.

Having been BBC Head of Light Entertainment from 1987–1993, Moir was appointed Controller of BBC Radio 2 in 1995 and took up his post in 1996. Many assumed this would be a quiet end to his career but he turned the station from a declining backwater to the most popular in the UK, winning back many former Radio 1 listeners who had defected to commercial radio. This was achieved through broadcasters like Steve Wright, Johnnie Walker, Janice Long, Paul Gambaccini, Lynn Parsons, Bob Harris and Alan Freeman, all of whom joined Radio 2 during Moir&#x27;s controllership.

Since June 2004 Moir has been a non-executive director of Celador Radio Broadcasting and advises on company licence applications. He is a Fellow of The Radio Academy.

==Personal life==
Moir lives in Pinner, in former Middlesex.

<doc id="1210851" wikidata="Q4159272" url="?curid=1210851" title="Greenspun's tenth rule">
<text>Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule of programming is an aphorism in computer programming and especially programming language circles that states:

==Overview==
The rule expresses the opinion that the argued flexibility and extensibility designed into the programming language Lisp includes all functionality that is theoretically needed to write any complex computer program, and that the features required to develop and manage such complexity in other programming languages are equivalent to some subset of the methods used in Lisp.

Other programming languages, while claiming to be simpler, require programmers to reinvent in a haphazard way a significant amount of needed functionality that is present in Lisp as a standard, time-proven base.

It can also be interpreted as a satiric critique of systems that include complex, highly configurable sub-systems. Rather than including a custom interpreter for some domain-specific language, Greenspun&#x27;s rule suggests using a widely accepted, fully featured language like Lisp.

Paul Graham also highlights the satiric nature of the concept, albeit based on real issues: 

The rule was written sometime around 1993 by Philip Greenspun. Although it is known as his tenth rule, this is a misnomer. There are in fact no preceding rules, only the tenth. The reason for this according to Greenspun:

Hacker Robert Morris later declared a corollary, which clarifies the set of &quot;sufficiently complicated&quot; programs to which the rule applies:

This corollary jokingly refers to the fact that many Common Lisp implementations (especially those available in the early 1990s) depend upon a low-level core of compiled C, which sidesteps the issue of bootstrapping but may itself be somewhat variable in quality, at least compared to a cleanly self-hosting Common Lisp.

<doc id="1210861" wikidata="Q633771" url="?curid=1210861" title="Owen Stanley Range">
<text>Owen Stanley Range is the south-eastern part of the central mountain-chain in Papua New Guinea. Its highest point is Mount Victoria at , while its most prominent peak is Mount Suckling.

==History==
Owen Stanley Range was seen in 1849 by Captain Owen Stanley while surveying the south coast of Papua and named after him. The eastern extremity of the range is Mount Victoria, which was climbed by Sir William MacGregor in 1888, and it extends as far west as Mount Thynne and Lilley. But the name is generally used to denote the whole of the chain of the Papuan Peninsula, from Mount Chapman to the south-eastern end of the island, and to include Mount Albert Edward which is really separated from it by the Wharton Chain.

==Geography==

The range is flanked by broken and difficult country, particularly on the south-western side. There are few practicable passes, the easiest being the famous Kokoda Track which crosses the range between Port Moresby and Buna and was in use for more than 50 years as a regular overland mail-route. Another route used by the 900 men of the US 2nd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Division, was the Kapa Kapa Trail, parallel to but to the southeast of the Kokoda Track. They took nearly five weeks to cover the track over extraordinarily difficult jungle terrain, from 14 October to 20 November 1942.

Vehicular roads, though not impossible, would be very difficult and expensive to construct. In fact one was constructed during World War II crossing from Wau in the north to Bulldog in the south and known as the Bulldog Track. It was largely due to the impossibility of transporting heavy equipment across the range that the Japanese failed to secure Port Moresby as a base early in 1942. The mountains are rough and precipitous, with occasional fertile plateaus which are occupied by native food-gardens.

==Eponyms==
Two species of reptiles are named after Owen Stanley Range, &quot;Papuascincus stanleyanus&quot; and &quot;Toxicocalamus stanleyanus&quot;.

<doc id="1210866" wikidata="Q612403" url="?curid=1210866" title="Bulolo">
<text>Bulolo is a town in Wau-Bulolo Urban LLG, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. It was once an important gold dredging centre in the former Territory of New Guinea, situated on the Bulolo River, a tributary of the Markham River, about north-west of Wau. The town is served by Bulolo Airport.
Built in June 1930, the Bulolo strip was originally 1,150 yards by 120 yards. In 2010 it had an estimated population of 20,000.

Currently, the town&#x27;s major industries includes forestry, with the PNG Forest Products Limited the main enterprise. There is also an Insect Farming and Trading Agency, which promotes insect farming and conservation.

== History ==

Dredging for gold was begun on 21 March 1932, with the whole of the 1,100 ton dredge (No 1 dredge) transported to the field in pieces by air from the port city of Lae. The largest single part was the main tumbler shaft, 12 feet long and weighing 6,870 pounds. Construction of No 2 dredge was underway before No 1 dredge was completed. In all eight dredges were constructed and operated, the last going into operations in 1939.

Dredging operations were interrupted by the war in 1941, and were not resumed until six years later. On 5 February 1942 at 11am, Bulolo was bombed by five twin-engine bombers.

Gold production in 1952 amounted to 122,035 ounces, valued at £1,311,241, and constituted 77 per cent of the gold produced in New Guinea in that year. As the gold petered out the dredges were abandoned and they can still be found along the Bulolo river bed.

Bulolo was the headquarters of a company formed to exploit the pine forests that grow in the valley. In conjunction with the milling of timber an extensive scheme of re-afforestation was undertaken to ensure perpetuity of supplies.

Since the 1950s Bulolo has been connected to Lae by a vehicular road along the Bulolo and Markham River valleys.

<doc id="1210870" wikidata="Q7691415" url="?curid=1210870" title="TEAMtalk 252">
<text>TEAMtalk 252 was a short-lived UK national commercial sports radio station, based in Leeds in West Yorkshire with long wave transmission coming from the Clarkstown radio transmitter in Trim, County Meath in Ireland, formerly used by Atlantic 252.

Its 24-hour sports content included a popular news-based breakfast show, sports phone-ins, discussions and specialist programming.

The station was broadcast on the 252 kHz Longwave across Ireland and the United Kingdom, and was also available to listeners on Sky and online.

== Launch ==
The station was launched on 11 March 2002 at 2pm as the UK&#x27;s first national commercial radio station dedicated 100% to sport, providing entertaining and informative coverage of all UK football, rugby, racing, cricket and all major sporting events. TEAMtalk 252 also provided a number of specialist programmes dedicated to racing, cricket, motor racing, non-league football, business, rugby league, US sports and live coverage of the British Basketball League.

TEAMtalk 252 launched with the help of former England International Teddy Sheringham and Footballers&#x27; Wives star Zöe Lucker, who played Tanya Turner, and although it had 19 studios and employed 100 full-time sports journalists, the newcomer made no attempt to muscle into the patch already covered by BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport. Both stations had already spent millions on buying broadcast rights for live sports commentaries, but TEAMtalk 252 said it would concentrate on news, analysis and opinion in addition to their Saturday night British Basketball League coverage.

The station&#x27;s biggest names included former England International Phil Neal, Jamie Broadbent who was part of Chris Evans&#x27; Virgin Radio Breakfast Show and broadcasting personality James H. Reeve. John Meek, George Riley, Jonathan Doidge, Adam Pope, Neil Henderson, John Newcombe, Simon Barlow, Tim Thornton and Al Bentley were all part of TEAMtalk 252&#x27;s launch schedule.

Speaking about its launch, TEAMtalk Media Group sports director Ian Holding said: &quot;Sports fans will come to know TEAMtalk 252 as the only station where they can tune in and guarantee to find sport. We have a great team in place and an enviable number of sports journalists who will enable us to deliver the broadest sports coverage possible.&quot;

== Programming ==
TEAMtalk 252&#x27;s programming consisted of sports talk, sports phone-ins, discussions and specialist programming 24 hours a day.

The day began with the morning&#x27;s sports news, debate and reaction on The Full Sports Breakfast with Jon Meek and George Riley, before the baton was passed to Jamie Broadbent and Adam Pope on It&#x27;s Your Shout, who took an in-depth look at the day&#x27;s sports stories and invited listeners to have their say, before James H. Reeve hosted an afternoon sports talk show with live horse racing and interviews. Neil Henderson and Jon Newcombe rounded-up the day&#x27;s sports news on Drive including all the latest stories from around the United Kingdom with their team of reporters.

Sportsnight, hosted by Simon Barlow and Tim Thornton then guided listeners through the evening&#x27;s sporting action, before handing over to the late night team on The Final Whistle with Al Bentley and Terry &#x27;fatty&#x27; McGeadie, the station&#x27;s nightly sports phone-in. Up For It with Gavin Hamilton, Nolan Kane and Mike Cunliffe was broadcast throughout the night.

On Saturday and Sunday, TEAMtalk 252 had full coverage of the weekend&#x27;s sport with the latest news and scores from the ground on 252 Matchday, and also specialist programming including The Stable Breakfast, a show dedicated to horse racing, League Talk, presented by Jonathan Doidge and the only national radio sports show dedicated to rugby league, The Non League Show with Brendan Fatchett and The Business of Sport.

TEAMtalk 252 also broadcast coverage of the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea providing unofficial off-tube commentary of matches involving England national football team and the Republic of Ireland national football team, in addition to the knockout stages. This was despite the fact that BBC Radio 5 Live held broadcast rights to the tournament, and Talksport also provided their own unofficial off-tube coverage.

== Presenters ==
TEAMtalk 252 had a roster of regular presenters, which included: Adam Pope, Al Bentley, Brendan Fatchett, Jonathan Doidge, Nick Millard, Gavin Hamilton, George Riley, James H. Reeve, Jamie Broadbent, Jason Thornton, Jon Meek, Jon Newcombe, Mike Cunliffe, Neil Henderson, Nick &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, Nolan Kane, Phil Neal, Simon Barlow, Seth Bennett, Terry &#x27;fatty&#x27; McGeadie, John Hunt and Tim Thornton.

== Audience ==
TEAMtalk 252&#x27;s first and only set of RAJAR audience figures showed the station had 428,000 listeners a week in the first quarter of 2002. Its Irish audience figures were never measured. For the same period, rivals Talksport increased its overall weekly audience to 2.47 million, while BBC Radio 5 Live had 6.4 million listeners. Audience figures for TEAMtalk 252 were not helped by its poor signal in London and the south east of England.

== Demise ==
TEAMtalk had a reported £28 million in the bank and allocated £8m to TEAMtalk 252 stating it needed to break even by 2004, but that it didn&#x27;t have enough money to bid for major exclusive sporting rights.

Instead the station set about quickly growing its audience around sports news, discussion shows and creative programming, but the divided TEAMtalk board was under pressure in the post tech-stock era and the costs of operating the channel became more difficult to reconcile, despite its increasing popularity and use of originated content across other channels.

As a result of disagreements over the company&#x27;s direction, TEAMtalk&#x27;s group chairman Bill Wilson stepped down in April and by mid-May 2002. TEAMtalk 252&#x27;s owners confirmed that it was in discussions with a number of parties who had expressed an interest in buying either part of or all off the TEAMtalk group. It had, a week previously, been approached by online betting business ukbetting plc with an offer of £10.2m for lock, stock and barrel — this was rejected by the TEAMtalk management. In April 2002, £9.5m was written off by TEAMtalk which admitted it had over-stretched itself financially. By the end of May 2002, TEAMtalk 252&#x27;s future was thrown firmly into doubt when a deal was done between the parent company TEAMtalk and previous group bidder ukbetting to take over TEAMtalk for £13.7m.

ukbetting appeared to be mainly interested in TEAMtalk&#x27;s other sporting services including internet site TEAMtalk.com; at that time ukbetting&#x27;s portfolio of websites included sports sites sportinglife.com, sportal.com and bettingzone.co.uk, as well as betting sites totalbet.com and ukbetting.com. Subsequent takeovers have added Oddschecker.co.uk, Rivals.net, Football365, Golf365, Cricket365, Planet-Rugby and Planet-F1 among others to the stable.

TEAMtalk 252 closed suddenly on 31 July 2002. Staff were informed at a meeting held that morning that the station would close between 12:00 and 14:00 that day. The station ended broadcasting at 13:42 as presenter James H Reeve said, &quot;My dad always said don&#x27;t start something you can&#x27;t finish, and he&#x27;d be proud of me now.&quot; It is reported that it was cut mid-sentence.

== Legacy: Streaming audio &amp; FM ==
teamtalk.com subsequently established a business of providing streaming audio commentary services to sporting businesses, notably betting shops such as Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power.

TEAMtalk also provide broadcast services for live Restricted Service Licence FM stations at sporting venues, including for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. As with most other RSL stations, these operate for a strictly limited number of days on strictly limited power, typically allowing reception only within a couple of miles (kilometres) of the venue. The RSL stations are also broadcast over the internet.

<text>Hugh Joseph Roddin (March 10, 1887 – March 3, 1954) was an Olympic boxer from Scotland. He was the first Scottish boxer to win an Olympic boxing medal when he took home the bronze in 1908.

==Biography==
Roddin, universally known as &#x27;Hughie&#x27;, was raised in the Newbigging district of Musselburgh in East Lothian. Hughie first came into contact with boxing through legendary Charles &#x27;Charlie&#x27; Cotter. Cotter worked as a timekeeper, physical trainer and boxing coach and a dominant figure in Scottish boxing. Hughie rapidly won two Scottish Eastern District Featherweight Titles under Cotter&#x27;s guidance. Even better was to follow in the years 1907-08, when he went on to win the Scottish Amateur Featherweight Title.

He won a silver trophy in an open boxing championship at the Pavilion Theatre in Musselburgh in 1906. The building he trained and fought in is being refurbished and used as a museum of Scottish boxing, including a display of Hugh Roddin memorabilia.

Hugh Roddin won his bronze medal at the 1908 London Olympics. He was a featherweight (57 kg). They had not originally planned to include boxing in the 1908 Olympics, so it was held after all of the other events in October. His fight was a 37 bout marathon session that started at 11:25 am and went until 10:30 pm. Because it was held after all the other events, 32 of the 42 entrants were from Great Britain, including all of the featherweight medalists. Of the ten overseas entrants, nine were defeated in their first bout.

In 1911, Roddin emigrated to the United States.

Roddin had a 23 win and no loss record, according to author and journalist Brian Donald, in his research for a book on Scottish boxing history entitled &quot;The Fight Game in Scotland&quot;. This book devotes a complete chapter to Hugh Roddin. One of the fights was held in the old Vanderbilt Athletic Club in the Ninth Ward before World War I. In an extract that appeared in 1954 in the now-defunct Brooklyn News, Hughie Roddin, the great featherweight, was a real star. During a contest in Brooklyn&#x27;s Vanderbilt Club, he knocked out his opponent with a crushing blow in the first round. The club owners asked Roddin if he would go in with the same opponent after a 10-minute interval; Roddin agreed and knocked the same guy out again! Roddin&#x27;s career in the ring ended during World War One when he served in the U.S. Army&#x27;s 35th Division.

On returning, he ran several youth soccer teams in Brooklyn and athletics teams based at a gym he owned there. Roddin became the boxing coach at the American Legion in Rosedale, Long Island, New York, and taught his nephew Harold (Sonny) and many other boys the finer points of boxing. Sonny would go from Bayside to Rosedale many a Saturday night, go to the Legion, and then go home.

Hugh Roddin (Hugh&#x27;s nephew) tells a story that when Hugh Roddin was in his late years, he was approached in the park by a mugger to give up his wallet. Hugh reached into his coat as if to grab the wallet - and came out with a punch to knock the young man down. The young man was so stunned he got up and ran away. Hugh had said that an old boxer never loses his punch.

He died at age 66 in Brooklyn in 1954 and is buried at Long Island&#x27;s National Cemetery in Farmington, New York.

The boxing gloves Roddin used to win his Olympic medal now belong to author Brian Donald&#x27;s grandson Ruaridh. They were given to Brian Donald as a show of appreciation by Roddin&#x27;s family in the US for his work on the fighter in The Fight Game in Scotland, a history of Scottish boxing. They were on display in the National Museum of Scotland until its refurbishment in 2015 and are now being stored in a Scottish university&#x27;s archive.

<doc id="1210875" wikidata="Q7713535" url="?curid=1210875" title="The American Political Tradition">
<text>The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It is a 1948 book by Richard Hofstadter, an account of the ideology of previous Presidents of the United States and other political figures.

==Contents==
Hofstadter wrote the book with the support of a fellowship from his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., which was &quot;awarded to projects containing the promise of trustworthy scholarship combined with literary distinction of the kind that means some breadth of appeal.&quot;

Hofstadter&#x27;s introduction argues that the major political traditions in the United States, despite contentious battles, have all &quot;shared a belief in the rights of property, the philosophy of economic individualism, the value of competition ... [T]hey have accepted the economic virtues of a capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man.&quot;

Rather than focusing on political conflict, Hofstadter proposes that a common ideology of &quot;self-help, free enterprise, competition, and beneficent cupidity&quot; has guided the United States since its inception. Through analyses of the ruling class in the U.S., Hofstadter argues that this consensus is the hallmark of political life in the U.S.

Part of Hofstadter&#x27;s argument is to undermine the democratic credentials of politicians mythologized by historians, calling for reflection rather than nostalgia. Thomas Jefferson is presented as an ambiguous figure, an agrarian radical whose &quot;laissez-faire became the political economy of the most conservative thinkers in the country&quot;.

Andrew Jackson&#x27;s democracy is also characterized as &quot;a phase in the expansion of liberated capitalism&quot;, and Progressive trustbuster Theodore Roosevelt, though he &quot;despised the rich&quot;, is described by Hofstadter as a conservative frightened by &quot;any sign of organized power among the people&quot;. Hofstadter also writes that Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal – an amalgam of &quot;improvised&quot; programs – was &quot;far from being intrinsically progressive, [easily] capable of being adapted to very conservative purposes&quot;, but had nonetheless &quot;revived American liberalism&quot;.

The book describes the Emancipation Proclamation as having &quot;had all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading&quot; and &quot;declar[ing] free all slaves ... precisely where its effect could not reach.&quot; This is not the view held by at least one more recent scholar of the Emancipation Proclamation.

<text>The New Leader (1924–2010) was an American political and cultural magazine.

==History==

&quot;The New Leader&quot; began in 1924 under a group of figures associated with the Socialist Party of America, such as Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas. It was published in New York City by the American Labor Conference on International Affairs. Its orientation was liberal and anti-communist. The Tamiment Institute was its primary supporter.

Its overall politics shifted in its second decade: Under Levitas&#x27;s editorship, during years when the much-higher-circulation Nation and New Republic often ran acrobatic apologies for Stalin, the New Leader became a bi-weekly platform for what was then known as liberal anti-Communism.
==Editors==

* 1924-1940: James Oneal, founding editor
* 1936-1960: Sol Levitas, managing editor
* 1940-1960: Sol Levitas, executive editor
** 1945-1950: Liston M. Oak, managing editor
** 1950-1960: Suzanne La Follette, managing editor
** 1960-1961: Myron Kolatch, managing editor
* 1960-2006: Myron Kolatch, executive editor

==Contributors==
Its contributors were prominent liberal thinkers and artists. &quot;The New Leader&quot; was the first to publish Joseph Brodsky and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the United States. It was one of the first to publish Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;. Other contributors, who were generally paid nothing or only a modest fee, included James Baldwin, Daniel Bell, Willy Brandt, David Dallin, Milovan Djilas, Theodore Draper, Max Eastman, Ralph Ellison, Sidney Hook, Hubert Humphrey, George F. Kennan, Murray Kempton, Irving Kristol, Melvin Lasky, Richard J. Margolis, Reuben Markham, Claude McKay, C. Wright Mills, Hans Morgenthau, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Albert Murray, Ralph de Toledano, Reinhold Niebuhr, George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, Cyril Joad, Bayard Rustin, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Tony Sender.

==Closure==
&quot;The New Leader&quot; ceased print publication after the January/April 2006 double issue. A bimonthly online version was published from January/February 2007 to May/June/July/August 2010.

Longtime Editor Myron Kolatch conducted an interview with Columbia University&#x27;s &quot;The Current&quot; in 2007. He mainly discussed the history of journals of ideas (&quot;The New Leader&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;) and their role in politics and intellectual discourse. Kolatch&#x27;s &quot;Who We Are and Where We Came From&quot;, adapted from the last print issue, covers some of the same topics.

<text>Richard Kenneth Gunn (16 February 1871 – 23 June 1961) was a British boxer, and is the oldest man to win an Olympic boxing crown ever. He achieved this feat at the age of 37 years and 254 days.

==Biography==
He was born in Charing Cross, London and died in Lambeth, London.

Gunn took up boxing at the Surrey Commercial Docks Boxing Club in 1893 after joining his father&#x27;s East End tailoring business. He won the 1894, 1895 and 1896 Amateur Boxing Association British featherweight title when boxing out of the various clubs. 

He was so much better than his rivals at the time that authorities asked him to retire after he won his third ABA title. Gunn did so, but in 1908, having served on the ABA council for more than ten years, he returned to win the Olympic title before hanging up his gloves for good. Gunn died in London at the age of 90, having only lost one fight in fifteen years.

==1908 Olympic results==
Below is the record of Richard Gunn, a British featherweight boxer who competed at the 1908 London Olympics:

* Quarterfinal: defeated Etienne Poillot (France) by second-round knockout
* Semifinal: defeated Thomas Ringer (Great Britain) by decision, 2-0
* Final: defeated Charles Morris (Great Britain) by decision, 2-0 (won gold medal)

<doc id="1210883" wikidata="Q245794" url="?curid=1210883" title="Greek Cypriots">
<text>Greek Cypriots (, ) are the ethnic Greek population of Cyprus, forming the island&#x27;s largest ethnolinguistic community. According to the 2011 census, 659,115 respondents recorded their ethnicity as Greek, forming almost 99% of the 667,398 Cypriot citizens and over 78% of the 840,407 total residents of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus. These figures do not include the 29,321 citizens of Greece residing in Cyprus, ethnic Greeks recorded as citizens of other countries, or the population of illegally occupied Northern Cyprus.

The majority of Greek Cypriots are members of the Church of Cyprus, an autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church within the wider communion of Orthodox Christianity. In regard to the 1960 Constitution of Cyprus, the term also includes Maronites, Armenians, and Catholics of the Latin Church (&quot;Latins&quot;), who were given the option of being included in either the Greek or Turkish communities and voted to join the former due to a shared religion.

==History==
===Ancient Cyprus===
Cyprus was part of the Mycenaean civilization with local production of Mycenaean vases dating to the Late Helladic III (1400–1050 BC). The quantity of this pottery concludes that there were numerous Mycenaean settlers, if not settlements, on the island. Archaeological evidence shows that Greek settlement began unsystematically in c. 1400 BC, then steadied (possibly due to Dorian invaders on the mainland) with definite settlements established in c. 1200 BC. The close connection between the Arcadian dialect and those of Pamphylia and Cyprus indicates that the migration came from Achaea. The Achaean tribe may have been an original population of the Peloponnese, Pamphylia, and Cyprus, living in the latter prior to the Dorian invasion, and not a subsequent immigrant group; the Doric elements in Arcadian are lacking in Cypriot. Achaeans settled among the old population, and founded Salamis. The epic &quot;Cypria&quot;, dating to the 7th century BC, may have originated in Cyprus.

===Medieval Cyprus===
The Byzantine era profoundly molded Greek Cypriot culture. The institution of Greek Orthodox Christianity soon became an integral part of Greek Cypriot identity during this period, and its legacy persisted under foreign domination throughout the succeeding centuries. Since Cyprus was never the &quot;final goal&quot; of any external ambitions – insofar as destroying its civilisation and citizenry did not become a military objective, or necessity – the island simply fell under the dominion of whichever power controlled the Eastern Mediterranean region at the time.

Greek Cypriots did, however, endure oppressive rule under both the Lusignans and successive Venetian Republic, from the 1190s to 1570. King Aimery – whom succeeded his brother, Guy of Lusignan, in 1194 – was known for being particularly intolerant of the Orthodox Church, and saw Greek Cypriot land appropriated for use by newly-established Latin churches in major towns on the island. In addition, oppressive taxation was imposed upon locals by occupying forces, with tax collection conducted, by proxy, under administration of the Latin churches.

===Ottoman Cyprus===
The Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571 replaced Venetian rule. Despite the inherent oppression of foreign subjugation, the period of Ottoman rule (1570–1878) had a limited impact on Greek Cypriot culture. The Ottomans tended to administer their multicultural empire with the help of their subject &quot;millets&quot;, or religious communities. The &quot;millet&quot; system allowed the Greek Cypriot community to survive, administered on behalf of Constantinople by the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus. Cypriot Greeks were now able to take control of the land they had been working on for centuries. Although religiously tolerant, Ottoman rule was generally harsh and inefficient. The patriarch serving the Ottoman sultan acted as &quot;ethnarch&quot;, or leader of the Greek nation, and gained secular powers as a result of the gradual dysfunction of Ottoman rule, for instance in adjudicating justice and in the collection of taxes. Turkish settlers suffered alongside their Greek Cypriot neighbors, and the two groups together endured centuries of oppressive governance from Constantinople. A minority of Greek Cypriots converted to Islam during this period, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;neo-Muslims&quot; by historians.

===Modern history===
Politically, the concept of &quot;enosis&quot; – unification with the Greek &quot;motherland&quot; – became important to literate Greek Cypriots after Greece declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. A movement for the realization of &quot;enosis&quot; gradually formed, in which the Church of Cyprus played a dominant role during the Cyprus dispute.

During the period of British colonial rule (1878–1960), an efficient colonial administration was established, but government and education were administered along ethnic lines, accentuating differences. For example, the education system was organized with two Boards of Education, one Greek and one Turkish, controlled by Athens and Istanbul, respectively. The resulting Greco-Turkish educational systems emphasized linguistic, religious, cultural, and ethnic differences and downplayed traditional ties between the two Cypriot communities. The two groups were encouraged to view themselves as extensions of their respective motherlands, leading to the development of two distinct nationalities with antagonistic loyalties.

The importance of religion within the Greek Cypriot community was reinforced when the Archbishop of the Church of Cyprus, Makarios III, was elected the first president of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. For the next decade and a half, &quot;enosis&quot; was a key issue for Greek Cypriots, and a key cause of events leading up to the 1974 coup, which prompted the Turkish invasion and occupation of the northern part of the island. Cyprus remains divided today, with the two communities almost completely separated. Many of those whom lost their homes, lands and possessions during the Turkish invasion, emigrated mainly to the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, South Africa and Europe, although most left Cyprus before 1974. There are today estimated to be 335,000 Greek Cypriot emigrants living in Great Britain. The majority of the Greek Cypriots in Great Britain currently live in England; there is an estimate of around 3,000 in Wales and 1,000 in Scotland.
By the early 1990s, Greek Cypriot society enjoyed a high standard of living. Economic modernization created a more flexible and open society and caused Greek Cypriots to share the concerns and hopes of other secularized West European societies. The Republic of Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, officially representing the entire island, but suspended for the time being in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.

==Population==
Greeks in Cyprus number 659,115, according to the 2011 Cypriot census. There is a notable community of Cypriots and people of Cypriot descent in Greece. In Athens, the Greek Cypriot community numbers ca. 55,000 people. There is also a large Greek Cypriot diaspora, particularly in the United Kingdom.

===Diaspora===

==Culture==

===Cuisine===
Cypriot cuisine, as with other Greek cuisine, was imprinted with the spices and herbs made common as a result of extensive trade links within the Ottoman Empire. Names of many dishes came to reflect the sources of the ingredients from the many lands . Coffee houses pervasively spread throughout the island into all major towns and countless villages.

===Language===

The everyday language of Greek Cypriots is Cypriot Greek, a dialect of Modern Greek. It shares certain characteristics with varieties of Crete, the Dodecanese and Chios, as well as those of Asia Minor.

Greek Cypriots are generally educated in Standard Modern Greek, though they tend to speak it with an accent and preserve some Greek Cypriot grammar.

== Genetic studies ==

A 2017 study, found that Cypriots belong to a wide and homogeneous genetic domain, along with the people of the Aegean Islands (including Crete), Sicily, and southern Italy (including the Greek-speaking minorities of Apulia and Calabria), while the continental part of Greece, including Peloponnesus, appears as slightly differentiated, by clustering with the other Southern Balkan populations of Albania and Kosovo. The study calls this distinct genetic domain, the &quot;Mediterranean genetic continuum&quot;.

A 2017 archaeogenetics study, concluded that both the Mycenaean Greeks and the Minoans were genetically closely related, and that both are closely related, but not identical, to modern Greek populations. The FST between the sampled Bronze Age populations and present-day West Eurasians was estimated, finding that Mycenaeans are least differentiated from the populations of Greece, Cyprus, Albania, and Italy.

A 2017 study, found that both Greek Cypriots&#x27; and Turkish Cypriots&#x27; patrilineal ancestry derives primarily from a single pre-Ottoman local gene pool. The frequency of total haplotypes shared between Greek and Turkish Cypriots is 7-8%, with analysis showing that none of these being found in Turkey, thus not supporting a Turkish origin for the shared haplotypes. No shared haplotypes were observed between Greek Cypriots and mainland Turkish populations, while total haplotypes shared between Turkish Cypriots and mainland Turks was 3%. Both Cypriot groups show close genetic affinity to Calabrian (southern Italy) and Lebanese patrilineages. The study states that the genetic affinity between Calabrians and Cypriots can be explained as a result of a common ancient Greek (Achaean) genetic contribution, while Lebanese affinity can be explained through several migrations that took place from coastal Levant to Cyprus from the Neolithic (early farmers), the Iron Age (Phoenicians), and the Middle Ages (Maronites and other Levantine settlers during the Frankish era). The authors note however that the Calabrian samples used in the analysis were relatively small (n = 30 comparative dataset, n = 74 YHRD) and thus these results should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, from the Greek sub-populations, Cretan Greeks were found to be the closest to Cypriots. In terms of Rst pairwise genetic differences, which indicate deeper shared paternal ancestry than shared haplotypes, Greeks appear genetically close to Cypriots, and equidistant from Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots have similar frequencies for their major patrilineal haplogroups, with the main subclades for both being J2a-M410 (23.8% and 20.3% resp.), E-M78 (12.8% and 13.9% resp.) and G2-P287 (12.5% and 13.7% resp.). The biggest differentiating characteristic between Greek Cypriots and mainland Greeks is the low frequency of haplogroups I, R1a among Greek Cypriots because the mainland Greek population has received considerable migrations during the Byzantine era and the Middle Ages from other Balkanic populations, such as Slavs, Aromanians (Vlachs), and Albanians (Arvanites), while the biggest differentiating characteristic between Greek Cypriots and Middle Easterners is the much lower frequency of haplogroup J1 among the Greek Cypriots. Greek Cypriots are also differentiated by Turkish Cypriots in some aspects; namely Turkish Cypriots have 5.6% Eastern Eurasian (likely Central Asian/Turkic) and 2.1% North African patrilineal ancestry, while Greek Cypriots have 0.6% Eastern Eurasian and no North African patrilineal ancestry.

<text>Frederick Grace (29 February 1884 – 23 July 1964) was a lightweight boxer. He fought as Fred Grace and at the 1908 Olympic Games he became Olympic champion, defeating Matt Wells along the way. He also became the British and European amateur champion.

==Biography==
Born in Edmonton, Middlesex, he first became a boxer at Eton Mission Boxing Club. Using the facilities provided by Eton Mission, he also became proficient on the parallel bars.
In his early 20s, Fred incurred serious damage to his knee after an incident on his motorcycle. Fred declined the surgeon&#x27;s advice to amputate and was determined to regain his fitness. Subsequently, from that time to the Olympics in 1908, he never figured in any title challenges.

After the Games, Grace went on to win four Amateur Boxing Association British lightweight titles between 1909 and 1920, when boxing out of the Eton Mission ABC and Eton Boys BC respectively. However, whilst in his prime, boxing was banned from the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm and WW1 canceled out the Olympics of 1916, therefore Grace was unable to defend his title. By 1920, he was 36 years old. At the Olympics in Antwerp, he won just one bout in the lightweight class before being eliminated by the eventual winner of the title, Samuel Mosberg, of the US.

Grace worked as a heating engineer for most of his life and retired in 1949. He died on 23 July 1964 at Ilford, Essex, aged 80, after being struck by a car while out walking.

<text>Richard Henry Popkin (December 27, 1923 – April 14, 2005) was an American academic philosopher who specialized in the history of enlightenment philosophy and early modern anti-dogmatism. His 1960 work &quot;The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Descartes&quot; introduced one previously unrecognized influence on Western thought in the seventeenth century, the Pyrrhonian Scepticism of Sextus Empiricus. Popkin also was an internationally acclaimed scholar on Christian millenarianism and Jewish messianism.

==Life==
Richard Popkin was born in Manhattan to author Zelda Popkin and her husband Louis Popkin, who together ran a small public relations firm. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree and, in 1950, his Ph.D. from Columbia University. He taught at American universities, including the University of Connecticut, The University of Iowa, Harvey Mudd College, the University of California, San Diego, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of California, Los Angeles. He was visiting professor at University of California Berkeley, Brandeis University, Duke University, Emory University, Tel Aviv University, and was Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York. Popkin was the founding director of the International Archives of the History of Ideas.

Among his honors, Popkin was awarded the Nicholas Murray Butler Medal by Columbia University and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was president emeritus and founding editor of the &quot;Journal of the History of Philosophy&quot;.

Richard Popkin spent his later years living in Pacific Palisades, California. He died of emphysema in Los Angeles in April 2005. His papers have been archived at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at UCLA.

==Family==

Popkin was survived by Juliet (née Greenstone, 1924–2015), whom he married in 1944, and two of their three children, the historian Jeremy Popkin (b. 1948) and his younger daughter, Susan Popkin (b. 1961). Margaret Popkin (1950–2005) was a prominent civil rights lawyer and activist, known particularly for her work in El Salvador during the civil war of the 1980s.

==Works==
Popkin published many textbooks on philosophy, some with Avrum Stroll. He was editor and translator of selections from &quot;Pierre Bayle’s Historical and Critical Dictionary&quot; (1965). His last book, &quot;Disputing Christianity&quot; (2007), was completed posthumously by his son Jeremy.

Popkin published two autobiographical writings: &quot;Intellectual Autobiography: Warts and All&quot; in &quot;The Sceptical Mode in Modern Philosophy. Essays in Honor of Richard H. Popkin&quot;, 1988, pp. 103–149, and a continuation: &quot;Introduction: Warts and All Part 2&quot;, in &quot;Everything Connects: In Conference with Richard H. Popkin. Essays in His Honor&quot;, 1999, pp. XI-LXXVI.

Beyond his philosophical works, he is noted for writing &quot;The Second Oswald&quot; (1966), questioning the Warren Report lone gunman explanation of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Popkin&#x27;s theory was that a look-alike of Lee Harvey Oswald was the actual assassin of Kennedy.

<doc id="1210893" wikidata="Q74514" url="?curid=1210893" title="Norman Scott (admiral)">
<text>Norman (Nicholas) Scott (August 10, 1889 – November 13, 1942) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. He was killed along with many of his staff when the ship he was on – the light cruiser – was hit by gunfire from the heavy cruiser during the nighttime fighting in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. He was the second of five US Navy admirals killed in battle during WWII, including: Isaac C. Kidd (1941, Attack on Pearl Harbor); Daniel J. Callaghan (later on same night, in same battle, as Scott); Henry M. Mullinnix (1943, Battle of Makin); and Theodore E. Chandler (1945, invasion of Lingayen Gulf).

Scott posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Pacific Theater of World War II.

==Biography==
Scott was born August 10, 1889, in Indianapolis, Indiana. Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1907, he graduated four years later and received his commission as ensign in March 1912. During 1911–13, Ensign Scott served in the battleship , then served in destroyers and related duty. In December 1917, he was executive officer of when she was sunk by a German submarine and was commended for his performance at that time. During the rest of World War I, Lieutenant Scott had duty in the Navy Department and as Naval Aide to President Woodrow Wilson. In 1919, while holding the temporary rank of lieutenant commander, he was in charge of a division of Eagle Boats (PE) and commanded &quot;Eagle&quot; PE-2 and &quot;Eagle&quot; PE-3.

During the first years of the 1920s, Norman Scott served afloat in destroyers and in the battleship and ashore in Hawaii. From 1924 to 1930, he was assigned to the staff of Commander Battle Fleet and as an instructor at the Naval Academy. He commanded the destroyers and in the early 1930s, then had further Navy Department duty and attended the Naval War College&#x27;s Senior Course. After a tour as executive officer of the light cruiser , Commander Scott was a member of the U.S. Naval Mission to Brazil in 1937–39. Following promotion to the rank of captain, he was commanding officer of the heavy cruiser until shortly after the United States entered World War II in December 1941.

Captain Scott was assigned to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations during the first months of 1942. After becoming a rear admiral in May, he was sent to the south Pacific, where he commanded a fire support group during the invasion of Guadalcanal and Tulagi in early August. Rear Admiral Scott continued to lead surface task units for the next three months, as the campaign to hold Guadalcanal intensified. He was present during the Battle of Savo Island on the cruiser , albeit miles from the action. In September 1942, he was named commander of Task Force 64, a mixed cruiser and destroyer surface warfare unit. The combat-minded, pugilistic Scott thoroughly trained and drilled his combat group in gunnery, maneuvers, and night fighting. This training paid off when, on October 11–12, 1942, he led his force to victory in the Battle of Cape Esperance, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first surface victory of the campaign. He maneuvered his ships so as to successfully perform the classically desired &quot;crossing the T&quot; of the opposing Japanese force.

A month later, on November 13, he was second-in-command during the initial night action of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Many felt, at the time and with hindsight, that the fighting-minded and experienced Scott would have made a more effective overall commander of the US force than inexperienced first-in-command Daniel J. Callaghan, and that Scott perhaps would not have made some of Callaghan&#x27;s mistakes. During that engagement, Rear Admiral Scott was killed in action when the bridge of his flagship, the light cruiser , was inadvertently struck by gunfire from Callaghan&#x27;s flagship, the heavy cruiser , which joined with an enemy torpedo to fatally damage the &quot;Atlanta&quot;. For his &quot;extraordinary heroism and conspicuous intrepidity&quot; in the October and November battles, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor.

As was his fellow Admiral Callaghan (killed later the same night), Admiral Scott was buried at sea.

==Namesakes==
The U.S. Navy ships , 1943–1973, and , 1981–1998, were named in honor of Rear Admiral Scott. The Scott Center Annex, adjacent to Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth Virginia, is named for him. The Norman Scott Natatorium at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland is named for him for being instrumental in introducing intercollegiate swimming to the Naval Academy as a midshipman. Norman Scott Road on Naval Base San Diego and Training Support Center Great Lakes also honors his memory.

==Medal of Honor citation==

For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty during action against enemy Japanese forces off Savo Island on the night of 11–12 October and again on the night of 12–13 November 1942. In the earlier action, intercepting a Japanese Task Force intent upon storming our island positions and landing reinforcements at Guadalcanal, Rear Adm. Scott, with courageous skill and superb coordination of the units under his command, destroyed 8 hostile vessels and put the others to flight. Again challenged, a month later, by the return of a stubborn and persistent foe, he led his force into a desperate battle against tremendous odds, directing close-range operations against the invading enemy until he himself was killed in the furious bombardment by their superior firepower. On each of these occasions his dauntless initiative, inspiring leadership and judicious foresight in a crisis of grave responsibility contributed decisively to the rout of a powerful invasion fleet and to the consequent frustration of a formidable Japanese offensive. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.

<text>Albert Leonard Oldman (18 November 1883 – 15 January 1961) was an English super heavyweight boxer in the 1908 Olympics in London for Great Britain.

==Biography==
Oldman was born in Mile End, London in 1883. His passage to Olympic gold was one of the smoothest ever as he knocked out his first rival within a minute. He received a bye in the semi-final and defeated Sydney Evans, his fellow Briton, in less than two minutes in the final.

Oldman, who served in the Royal Horse Guards, later became a policeman in the City of London Police. He emigrated to join the Ceylon force in 1910.

He died on 15 January 1961, at the age of 77, in Upminster, London.

<text>Catholic High School (CHS) is a government-aided autonomous Catholic boys&#x27; school in Bishan, Singapore, founded in 1935 by a French missionary, Reverend Father Edward Becheras. One of the Special Assistance Plan schools in Singapore, it has a primary section offering a six-year programme and a secondary section offering a four-year programme. Since 2013, it has partnered with Eunoia Junior College for a six-year Integrated Programme, which allows its secondary students to proceed to Eunoia for Years 5 and 6 and take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6.

== History ==
=== Sino-English Catholic School (1935–1942) ===
Catholic High School was founded in 1935 as Sino-English Catholic School () by the Reverend Father Edward Becheras, a French missionary. Although it was a Catholic school, it accepted both Catholic and non-Catholic students, and was run along the lines of a Sino-English school. The school first started as an extension of the Church of St. Peter and Paul. Fr Becheras envisaged the school as a bilingual institution from the start, emphasising instruction in both English and Chinese, a policy that continues today. In addition, Fr Becheras emphasised the teaching of science, uncommon at that time.

In 1936, Sino-English Catholic School moved into a purpose built school building at 222 Queen Street, beside the Church of St. Peter and Paul. Two years after the new school campus was completed, it reached its maximum capacity. Among notable features of the old school is the science room in the school, the first such feature in any Catholic school in Malaya (Singapore was part of Malaya at that time).

=== Expansion ===
After the Second World War, operation of the school resumed, adopting the name Catholic High School () . An increased enrolment saw the need for a new wing to be added to the high school compound, on the adjacent site of 51 Waterloo Street. The new wing featured an auditorium, staff rooms, tutorial rooms equipped with audio-visual equipment. Due to constraints in available spaces, the adjacent church grounds were used for physical education lessons.

In 1950, the Marist Brothers took over responsibility for the administration of Catholic High; a primary section was opened in 1951, with a new school building at 8 Queen Street. A boarding house for Catholic High students was also built. Under the supervision of the Marist Brothers, the school thrived along with Maris Stella High School, which was founded in 1958 to ease overwhelming applications for admission to Catholic High School.

In 1954, Catholic High School expelled all seventy students who were involved in the National Service riots for their absence from class, a move that shocked the nation. Catholic High School was the only institution that carried out expulsion as follow-up actions. The incident affirmed the school&#x27;s zero tolerance of students&#x27; involvement in any political activities, and the school&#x27;s stance of committed learning 

Pre-university classes were offered in Catholic High School between 1952 and 1975, with a number of graduates attaining the President&#x27;s Scholarship. In 1974 the administration of the school was handed back to the Catholic diocese. Before the full nationwide adoption of the junior college system in 1975, Catholic High School was the only Chinese-medium high school in Singapore that offered both the Chinese-medium Senior High Certificate () and the English-medium Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations to all of its students.

=== Attainment of SAP status ===
The Catholic High School was classified under the Special Assistance Plan in 1979. This enables it to offer students in the top 10% of the cohort both English and Chinese as their first languages. In the same year, pre-primary classes were started to prepare students for primary school Chinese study. With continued increase in enrolment, the Queen Street buildings could not house all the students from all levels, even with double-sessions arrangements. Satellite sites augmented the Queen Street school grounds. Pre-primary and lower-primary classes were housed at Gentle Road and upper-primary classes were housed at Norfolk Road. In March 1987, discovery of structural cracks at the Queen Street premises of the primary section caused the campus to be declared unsafe. Despite clarification later as a misjudgment, the incident prompted a decision by the Ministry of Education to relocate Catholic High School, for safety concerns in wake of the Hotel New World collapse. The high school section was relocated to the premises of Guangyang Secondary School in Bishan. Both the primary and secondary sections of the school moved to its current, permanent campus at Bishan Street 22 in 1992. In 2008, Catholic High School was awarded the School Distinction Award under the MOE Master Plan of Awards, in recognition of its value-added holistic development of its students through exemplary processes and practices.

=== Launch of Joint Integrated Programme ===
On 1 September 2010 the Ministry of Education announced that Catholic High School would become an Integrated Programme school in 2013. It partners CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls&#x27; School and Singapore Chinese Girls&#x27; School in the programme, and students from the school will proceed to Eunoia Junior College from 2017.

<doc id="1210913" wikidata="Q1698939" url="?curid=1210913" title="Pootie Tang">
<text>Pootie Tang is a 2001 American comedy film written and directed by Louis C.K.. Adapted from a comedy sketch that first appeared on &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;. The character Pootie Tang is a satire of the stereotyped action heroes who appeared in old blaxploitation films. The title character&#x27;s speech, which vaguely resembles pidgin, is mostly unintelligible to the audience, but the other characters in the film have no problem understanding him.

The film was a box office bomb, grossing just $3.3 million and received negative reviews for its humor and depiction of women.

==Plot==
Pootie Tang sits down for a TV interview, at which the interviewer (Bob Costas) asks about Pootie&#x27;s upcoming movie. At this point, a movie clip is played. Although initially unclear, the events described below all appear to be part of the movie clip played during the interview as revealed at the end of the movie.

Pootie Tang, born in &quot;a small town outside Gary, Indiana&quot;, is portrayed as a ladies&#x27; man who is &quot;too cool for words&quot;, even as a young child. His life is marked by the deaths of his mother &quot;Momma Dee&quot;, and shortly thereafter his father &quot;Daddy Tang&quot;, who dies after being mauled by a gorilla during his shift at the steel mill (the third time that year someone had suffered that particular fate). Just before Daddy Tang&#x27;s death, Pootie inherits his father&#x27;s belt and is told that (as long as he has right on his side) he can &quot;whoop anyone&#x27;s ass with just that belt.&quot; He uses his dying breath to warn his son to not let the ladies get between him and the belt.

As a young adult, Pootie Tang rises to fame and becomes well known for a variety of reasons. He sings in nightclubs, stars in public service announcements for children, produces top-of-the-charts music hits, and generally defeats wrongdoers with the power of his belt. Dick Lecter, the chief operating officer of multi-industrial conglomerate LecterCorp, learns of Pootie Tang&#x27;s positive influence on society — and his negative influence on LecterCorp&#x27;s bottom line. After his henchmen and a villain named Dirty Dee are sent away by Pootie&#x27;s friends, Lecter encourages his right-hand lady, Ireenie, to seduce Pootie Tang into signing an agreement with LecterCorp that would stop Pootie Tang&#x27;s influence on America&#x27;s children.

Pootie Tang falls for Ireenie&#x27;s tricks and subsequently falls apart. His pop cultural status is destroyed, and he engages on a quest to &quot;find [him]self&quot;. This journey is encouraged by his friend Biggie Shorty, who promises to wait for Pootie to return to her and to the rest of society. Pootie moves to a farm where the local sheriff decides Pootie should start dating his daughter. After his single corn stalk dies, he has a vision of Daddy Tang and Momma Dee. Daddy Tang reveals that there is nothing special about Pootie&#x27;s belt; instead, Pootie must fight evil with the goodness that is inside him. After dealing with Dirty Dee and his henchman Froggy (as well as getting his belt back), Pootie realizes he must move back to the city and fight crime once again.

Pootie Tang returns to the city just as Dick Lecter is unveiling the first of his new restaurant chain, Pootie&#x27;s Bad Time Burgers. At a small news conference, Pootie confronts Lecter only to discover that Lecter has amassed dozens of &quot;Pootie-alikes&quot; who will spread the message of LecterCorp around the nation. Pootie Tang, with the help of Biggie Shorty, defeats all of these henchmen and Lecter himself. Good triumphs over evil once again, and Biggie Shorty finally gets her man: she and Pootie Tang plan to get married now that Pootie is back. Elsewhere, Dick Lecter leaves corporate life and becomes an actor, Ireenie leaves him and becomes a counselor helping at-risk teenage prostitutes, and Dirty Dee is still dirty.

==Production==
Originally a Paramount Classics film titled &quot;Pootie Tang in Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine&quot;, the budget was increased and transferred to the main Paramount Pictures division. After watching Louis C.K. talk to Caldecot Chubb, one of the movie&#x27;s producers, Rock predicted that Chubb would eventually betray an unsuspecting C.K. and take the movie away from him. C.K. has said that he was all but fired from the film during the editing phase. According to him, Ali LeRoi was hired to extensively re-edit the film. Openly agreeing with Roger Ebert&#x27;s dismissive criticism that the movie should not have even been released, C.K. has said that the finished product, though containing parts he enjoyed, was far from his own vision.

==Reception==
Critical reception was generally negative. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 27% based on 45 reviews, with an average score of 3.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Based as it is on a short skit, &quot;Pootie Tang&quot; overstays its welcome.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 31 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film a half-star rating, criticizing it for its excessive use of vulgar language and demeaning portrayal of women, describing it as a &quot;train wreck&quot; and finishing his review by bluntly stating &quot;This film is not in a releasable condition.&quot; Nathan Rabin at &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said &quot;Pootie Tang&quot; &quot;borders on audience abuse&quot; and &quot;confuse[s] idiocy for absurdity and randomness for wit.&quot; In 2009, fellow &quot;A.V. Club&quot; writer Scott Tobias revisited the film and included it in his New Cult Canon series, noting that &quot;&quot;Pootie Tang&quot; repelled mainstream critics and audiences, but it holds an exalted status among alt-comedians and fans of subversive anti-comedy in general.&quot;

Kevin Murphy also praised the film in his book &quot;A Year at the Movies&quot;:
==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing mainstream hip hop, dance, and R&amp;B music was released on June 16, 2001, by Hollywood Records. It peaked at #51 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and #22 on the Top Soundtracks.

==In popular culture==
* In Snoop Dogg’s song “Bo$$ Playa” from his 2002 album &quot;Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss&quot;, the chorus includes the line “Okay, ‘Sa Da Tay’ like my nigga Pootie Tang”.
* In Season 2, Episode 3 of the television series &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; (&quot;Pink Gold&quot;), Chris Rock (who appears in &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;) attends a poker game at Bernie Mac&#x27;s house. A player remarks that he loves &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;, to which Rock replies, &quot;My mother didn&#x27;t see that one.&quot;
* In the 2003 horror film spoof &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot;, George Carlin&#x27;s character, The Architect, says he accidentally returned a cursed video tape to Blockbuster, thinking it was &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;. Subsequently, aliens arrive on Earth and claim they watched the video tape that spurred their visits to Earth because they thought it was &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;.
* In Kanye West&#x27;s song &quot;School Spirit&quot; from his 2004 album &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, West references the movie when he raps, &quot;See, that&#x27;s how dude became the young Pootie Tang — tippy tow&quot;.
* In Megan Thee Stallion&#x27;s song &quot;Freak Nasty&quot; from her 2018 EP &quot;Tina Snow&quot;, she references the movie when she raps, &quot;call that pussy Pootie Tang, &#x27;cus I got the runny kine&quot;. &quot;Runny Kine&quot; are the last two words in the title of Pootie&#x27;s upcoming (fictional) movie, for which he is being interviewed during the first scene of the film.
* In Veeze&#x27;s song &quot;GOMD&quot; from his 2023 album Ganger, he references the movie when he raps, &quot;he done dropped a hundred tapes, made no noise like Pootie Tang&quot;.

<doc id="1210915" wikidata="Q1235930" url="?curid=1210915" title="Colonus (Attica)">
<text>Colonus or Kolonos (; ,  &quot;Kolōnós&quot;) was a deme of the phyle Aegeis, of ancient Attica, celebrated as the deme of Sophocles, and the scene of one of the poet&#x27;s tragedies, was situated ten stadia from the gate of the city, called Dipylum, near Plato&#x27;s Academy and the river Cephissus. It derived its name from two small but conspicuous heights, which rise from the plain a little to the north of the Academy. Hence it is called by Sophocles &quot;the white Colonus&quot;. It was under the especial care of Poseidon, and is called by Thucydides the ἱερόν of this god. It is frequently called Colonus Hippius or Kolonos Hippeios (Κολωνός Ἵππειος) or Hippius Colonus or Hippeios Kolonos (Ἵππειος Κολωνός), both meaning &quot;Colonus of the Horses&quot;, to distinguish it from the &quot;Colonus Agoraeus&quot; in Athens. Besides the temple of Poseidon, it possessed a sacred grove of the Eumenides, altars of Athena Hippia, Demeter, Zeus, and Prometheus, together with sanctuaries of Peirithous, Theseus, Oedipus, and Adrastus. According to Greek mythology, Oedipus was buried there, as described by Sophocles, who was born there, in his &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;. The natural beauties of the spot are described by Sophocles in the magnificent chorus: &quot;Here the nightingale, a constant guest, trills her clear note under the trees of green glades, dwelling amid the wine-dark ivy and the god&#x27;s inviolate foliage, rich in berries and fruit, unvisited by sun, unvexed by the wind of any storm. Here the reveller Dionysus ever walks the ground, companion of the nymphs that nursed him.&quot; 

In the Athenian oligarchic revolution of 411 BCE, the oligarchs convened at the sanctuary of Poseidon Hippios at Colonus to frame their new constitution.

The site of Colonus is at Agia Eleousa in the modern neighborhood of Kolonos, which is named after the site.

==In literature==
* At the beginning of &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; by the playwright Sophocles, a character named Xenos describes the area to the blind outcast Oedipus. He claims that the area is sacred to the sea-god Poseidon and to Prometheus, the Titan who brought fire to mankind. It is also sacred to a former ruler and charioteer named Colonus, for whom the region was named and who is now venerated as a hero-god. Later, Oedipus prays to the Eumenides to allow him to take refuge there. At the end of the play, Oedipus&#x27; death and burial are described, but his gravesite is to be kept secret to avoid desecration. 
* &quot;The Gospel at Colonus&quot; by Lee Breuer is a modern adaptation of Sophocles&#x27; play employing gospel music.

<doc id="1210919" wikidata="Q2991146" url="?curid=1210919" title="Brome County, Quebec">
<text>Brome County, is a historical county of Quebec. It takes its name from the name of a manor in the parish of Barham in Kent, England that was named after the broom plant. It was named by English surveyors. The earliest settlers to this region were brought from New Hampshire by the Quaker leader, Nicholas Austin in the 1790s. The county was formed in 1855 from parts of Stanstead, Shefford and Missisquoi counties. The county is located in the Eastern Townships, one of the 12 regions of Quebec. The county lies in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Its eastern half is rolling countryside while its western half is part of the Richelieu River plains.

The county is roughly an upside-down &quot;L&quot; shape, bound on the south by the Canada–US border (along 45° for 17.5 km from 72° 15′ W in Lake Memphremagog to 72° 41.5′ W), in the east by in part Lake Memphremagog and Stanstead County, in the north by Shefford County (45° 20′ N for 48 km from 72° 15′ W to 72° 52′ W) and in the west by Rouville and Missisquoi counties. The county is divided into five townships, three in the north and two in the south. The townships in the north are, from east to west, the Township of Bolton, the Township of Brome and the Township of Farnham. The southern townships are the Township of Potton in the east and the Township of Sutton in the west. The county seat is Knowlton in the Township of Brome. Notable physical features of the county include Mount Brome in the northwestern corner of the Township of Brome and the much larger Mount Sutton in the Township of Sutton, and Brome Lake in the eastern part of the Township of Brome, which flows into the Yamaska River, site of a famous duck farm. Along Lake Memphremagog in the Township of Potton are three mountains, from north to south, Mount Sugar Loaf, the larger Mount Owl&#x27;s Head, and Mount Bear. Owl&#x27;s Head and Sutton are well-known ski hills.

In the early 1980s the county was abolished and the western half was transferred to the new Regional County Municipality of Brome-Missisquoi and the eastern half was transferred to the Regional County Municipality of Memphrémagog. A small part in the northwest were transferred to the Regional County Municipality of La Haute-Yamaska.

<text>National Junior College (NJC) is a government junior college located in Bukit Timah, Singapore. Established in 1969, it was the first government junior college in Singapore. NJC offers a two-year course for pre-university students and a six-year Integrated Programme, both leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations. It is among top 5 junior colleges in the country in terms of minimum entry cut off points. Former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong is among its notable alumni.

==History==
First announced by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in May 1965 as a &quot;super secondary boarding school&quot;, it was the first specialised co-educational government school established in independent Singapore for top pre-university students.

It was announced in December 1965 by then Minister for Education Ong Pang Boon that a centralised &quot;junior college&quot; system would be established to optimise the use of teachers and laboratory facilities and to create more educational opportunities for pre-university students. This system replaced the previous pre-university education conducted at various secondary schools across the country. In 1967, construction began on the first institution that operated under this arrangement, which was named National Junior College. On 20 January 1969, an inaugural assembly was held with the pioneer batch of 572 students. The college was officially declared open by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 14 May 1970.

Unlike other pre-university schools of the time, students were given the freedom and flexibility to opt for their subjects under the college&#x27;s lecture and tutorial system. This resulted in over 40 different subject combinations. Besides General Paper, which was compulsory, other subjects offered to students included Art, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, English Literature, Geography, History and Mathematics.

In keeping with its name and philosophy, the College claims no affiliation with any secondary school but instead draws its students from a wide spectrum. In addition, Singapore students learn alongside students from India, China, Hong Kong, Korea as well as ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. NJC also plays host to German, PRC, Taiwanese, Vietnamese and Japanese students in exchange programmes.

In January 1985, National Junior College introduced the Art Elective Programme, and subsequently rolled out the Humanities Scheme in 1987 with experienced British teachers specially arranged to tutor students in various humanities subjects. In 1992, NJC became the first junior college to offer German as part of its Language Elective Programme.

The college introduced the four-year Integrated Programme in 2004, allowing students to take on secondary education in the college and bypass the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examination. The programme was later expanded to a six-year Integrated Programme in 2009.

== Principal ==
== Identity and culture ==
===Uniform===
The uniform for male students is a shirt with shoulder epaulettes, secured by square silver buttons embossed with the school crest. The uniform for female students is similar, except that there are no pockets on the blouse and they have a pleated A-line skirt. Students also wear a pin, depicting the college crest, on the uniform&#x27;s left collar. The main colour of the school uniform is grey. 

===College Anthem and Song===
There are two official college songs – the College Anthem and a College Song, entitled &quot;The National Dream&quot;. The College Anthem was composed by Mr. Leong Yoon Pin, a renowned Singaporean composer whose works include the opera &quot;Bunga Mawar&quot; and the concert overture &quot;Dayong Sampan&quot;. The College Anthem is written in Malay, one of the four official languages in the Republic of Singapore.

===House System===
The house system at National Junior College was established in 1999, replacing the previous Department system. Through this system, students across the different cohorts get to bond together through intra-college house competition and activities. The six houses of the college and their respective mascots are as follows:
== Campus ==

Work started on National Junior College&#x27;s campus in September 1967. Located at the junction of Linden Road and Dunearn Road, the campus was completed in less than 15 months, at a cost of SGD $1.6 million. The original campus featured an audio-visual lab, 10 science laboratories, a library, two lecture theatres, 30 classrooms, nine tutorial rooms, an assembly hall, a canteen, an administrative block with other activity rooms. National Junior College used this campus until 1997, when it shifted to its present location at Hillcrest Road.

The current campus of National Junior College is located at 37 Hillcrest Road in Bukit Timah, houses both the Junior High and Senior High sections of the school, as well as a boarding school. This current campus features five lecture theatres (with two theatres having a seating capacity of 500), three tutorial room blocks and three information technology rooms. The campus also features three Sigma labs, which are equipped with sophisticated scientific instruments and equipment to promote science research in the college. The college has a dedicated art block as part of the Art Elective Programme (Singapore) (AEP). This Art Centre contains facilities such as a 3-dimensional work-pottery-sculpture studio, a drawing and painting studio, a pottery kiln room, and a photography darkroom to enable students in the AEP to experiment with different art media.

In May 2019, the school collaborated with food technology start-up Life3 Biotech to launch an agriculture-technology facility.
===Boarding school===
At the 2007 Ministry of Education Workplan Seminar, it was announced that five schools, including National Junior College, will each start their own boarding programme. Thus, National Junior College&#x27;s boarding school was constructed to cater to the new programme and it was officially opened on 16 May 2009. Built at a cost of SGD $20 million, this boarding school has 250 rooms housing around 500 students and teachers. In addition to housing foreign students, who make up half of the boarding school population, it also houses students who are participating in the college&#x27;s Enhanced Boarding Programme.

==Academic information==
National Junior College offers two education routes that lead to the GCE &#x27;A’ Level examinations:
* 6 year Integrated Programme (Years 7 to 12, 13-18 years old)
* 2 year JC Programme (Years 11 to 12, 17-18 years old)

Students who are admitted to the NJC Integrated Programme (at Junior High 1 and 3 level) will skip the GCE ‘O’ Level and take the GCE ‘A’ Level examinations at the end of their sixth year in NJC.

Students who are admitted to NJC JC Programme (at Senior High 1 level) must have taken their GCE &#x27;O’ Levels examinations or equivalent. They will take the GCE &#x27;A’ Level examinations at the end of their second year in NJC, like all other students taking the JC route towards the exam.

===Special Programmes===
In National Junior College, various special programmes are also offered in addition to the standard school curriculum. Such programmes aim to develop student interest in academic and non-academic fields beyond their chosen field of academic studies.

==== Art Elective Programme ====
National Junior College was the first school to offer the Art Elective Programme (AEP) in 1985 to allow student with a passion in Art to develop their talents. Under this programme, the college also provides specialised facilities to allow students to experiment with different art media. At the end of this programme, students are expected to sit for Art as a subject at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level at both the Higher 2 and Higher 3 levels. The college was also one of the six college to pioneer the Humanities Programme scheme in 1987, a scheme by Singapore&#x27;s Ministry of Education to encourage students to pursue the study of humanities at the pre-university level. In 1992, German was introduced as a subject for the first time in a junior college under the Language Elective Programme.

==== Music Programme ====
NJC also offers its own Music Programme, not to be confused with MEP (Music Elective Programme). It started in 2006 and is currently offers a 6-year course which culminates at &#x27;A’ Level, where students can take Music at Higher 2 level. However, the students may wish to drop the subject at the 2 or 4-year mark.

==== Language Elective Programme ====
NJC will be offering the Malay and Tamil Language Elective Programmes (LEP) from 2020.

==== Science Special Programmes ====
National Junior College also offer special programmes related to Science subjects. Some distinct programmes are featured below:
* Science Training and Research (STaR) Programme, a Science research programme. Students get to conduct their research together with the college&#x27;s local and international science research partners, such as A*STAR and the Korea Science Academy of KAIST. Under this programme, there is also the International Research Exchange Programme (IREP). Students selected to take part in this programme will embark on a year long of research with overseas partners around the world, such as Suzanne Cory High School in Australia, Waseda University Honjo Senior High School in Japan, Camborne Science and International Academy in the United Kingdom and many more. Senior High students can also participate in the NUS-A*STAR-NJC Science Research programme, where their work will be assessed by the National University of Singapore and will count as a Higher 3 credit at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations.
* Advanced Inquiry in Mathematics (AIM) Programme, a Mathematics enrichment programme. This programme allows students with an interest and strong ability in mathematics to participate in additional enrichment programmes during their Senior High Year 1.
*Special Programme in Inquiry Research (SPIRE), a research programme compulsory for all Junior High 2 students. Students will embark on a year-long research project in one of the following domains- Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics, Computing or Humanities. The programme culminates in the submission of a full-length research report and a research fair.

==== International and Local Summits and Conferences ====
As a college specialising in research, National Junior College also regularly hosts many conferences. This includes the International Humanities Symposium, Pre-University Summit and Singapore International STEM Innovation Challenge (SISTEMIC). These summits and conferences are jointly organised with the Ministry of Education, and is participated by more than 70 schools locally and internationally.

=== Enhanced Boarding Programme ===
The National Junior College&#x27;s boarding programme was launched in 2009 together with the opening of the boarding school. Under this programme, students stay in the boarding school for slightly less than one school term (5~8 weeks). Students also participate in the various activities planned during their stay. Such programmes include aesthetics programmes, leadership development programmes and night adventures. Since 2009, all Integrated Programme students from the college have participated in this compulsory programme.

==Co-curricular activities==
National Junior College provides its students with a wide range of co-curriculum activities. Sports and games include badminton, basketball, canoeing &amp; dragonboating, climbing, floorball, football, hockey, netball, shooting, softball, squash, table tennis, tennis, touch rugby and track and field/cross country. There are also performing arts such as Chinese orchestra/Guzheng ensemble, choir, guitar ensemble, string orchestra, symphonic band and dance groups (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Western). Students can also participate in various clubs and societies such as the Aesthetics Club, AVA &amp; PA Club, Debating &amp; Dramatic Societies (English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil), Greenlink Club, Interact Club and Outdoor Activities Club.

=== Student Council ===
The NJC Student Council consists of two wings - a Junior Wing comprising Junior High 2 to 4 students, alongside a Senior Wing comprising Junior High 4 to Senior High 2 students. Both wings of the Student Council work hand-in-hand to implement initiatives, such as the Junior High and Senior High Orientation programme for new students, that are aimed at improving the welfare of the student population. While in office, Student Councillors will be split into various committees that are in charge of the planning and execution of initiatives that fall under their respective roles. Some of these committees include: the College Outreach Committee which leverages on different types of media and design to reach out to the public and the student population events; the Student Development Committee focuses on the development of students in the college by planning events such as Career Festival and Student Investiture; the NJCommunity Welfare Committee which aims to build a more supportive culture amongst students through the setting up of platforms allowing for students to display appreciation for and encouragement towards one another; and the College Spirit Committee which rallies all NJCians together in an effort to foster a strong school spirit. In addition, the Councillors will also be allocated to event committees such as Orientation and Open House.

All prospective Student Councillors must first undergo a rigorous selection process before taking office; each term in office lasts for a period of 1 year. In particular, the Student Council President and Vice-President are elected to office by the student population and teachers. The Student Council is run by an overall Executive Committee consisting of the incumbent President, Vice-President, Honorary Secretary, Honorary Treasurer, Heads of Standing Committees as well as the six House Captains. 

==Notable alumni==
National Junior College has nurtured many notable alumni in various fields such as politics, civil service, business, academics, as well as entertainment. This includes former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, opposition politician Chen Show Mao, and actress and director Claire Wong.

<doc id="1210929" wikidata="Q7539914" url="?curid=1210929" title="Sleepless (Peter Wolf album)">
<text>Sleepless is the sixth solo album by Peter Wolf, released in 2002. The album ranked 427 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Wolf told &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; in 2002 that he had a &quot;pessimistic sensibility&quot; in his approach to making the album with no great expectations about the album’s commercial viability after watching his previous record &quot;die on the vine&quot; due to his then label (along with several others) being &quot;swallowed up in (a) big corporate conglomerate&quot;. He explained that he &quot;made this record figuring, ‘I have a lot of different interests, a lot of different roots, and this is the painting I feel like painting right now.’ And what’s the single? There is no single. I wasn’t thinking of hooks.&quot;

The album features notable guest appearances by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Wolf&#x27;s former J. Geils bandmate, Magic Dick, and Steve Earle.

<text>Acharagma is a genus of two cactus species from northern Mexico.

==Description==
These cacti are usually solitary but sometimes occur in small clusters. The globose stems tend to be about 3–7 cm in diameter. The ribs have tubercles, with ungrooved areoles. The flowers are at the stem tips, and range from cream to pink and yellow.

The genus is of relatively recent creation, the species originally being described as part of &quot;Escobaria&quot;, although recognized as a separate section by Nigel Taylor in 1983, and raised to a genus by Charlie Glass in 1998.

==Species==
, Plants of the World Online accepts two species. A third possible species, &quot;A. huasteca&quot;, described in 2011, is considered to be a synonym of &quot;Acharagma roseanum&quot; subsp. &quot;galeanense&quot;.

<doc id="1210938" wikidata="Q579524" url="?curid=1210938" title="Ann Summers">
<text>Ann Summers is a British multinational retailer company specialising in sex toys and lingerie, with 80 high street stores in the UK, Ireland, and the Channel Islands. In 2000, Ann Summers acquired the Knickerbox brand, a label with an emphasis on more comfortable and feminine underwear, while the Ann Summers-labelled products tend to be more erotic in style. The chain had an annual turnover of £117.3 million in 2007–2008.

==History==
The company was named after Annice Summers, the female secretary of the male founder, Michael Caborn-Waterfield.

Annice Summers was born Annice Goodwin in 1941, but later took her stepfather&#x27;s surname. She left the company soon after it opened, following a row with Caborn-Waterfield. She went to live in Umbria, Italy, two hours from Rome, and died of cancer in October 2012.

In 2000, Ann Summers acquired the underwear brand Knickerbox for an undisclosed sum. However, in 2014 they announced plans to sell the brand.

===Retail===
The first Ann Summers shop was opened in 1970 in Marble Arch, London, from which it grew to six shops.

Ann Summers was purchased in 1971 by brothers Ralph and David Gold, who turned it from a standard sex shop into an established high street brand and lingerie boutique. In 1981, David Gold installed his daughter Jacqueline Gold (who was the Executive Chair of Ann Summers) and she introduced the Party Plan concept. The retail operations for all of Ann Summers&#x27; shops are managed from their Head Office in Whyteleafe, Surrey and, as of December 2010, Ann Summers operated 144 retail outlets across the UK, Ireland, the Channel Islands and Spain.

The shops offer lingerie, underwear, cosmetics, swimwear and sex toys. The stores sell two million Rampant Rabbits, a kind of vibrator developed by Jacqueline Gold, per year.

===Ann Summers parties===
Jacqueline Gold initiated the Party Plan concept in 1981. Initially, the Ann Summers parties were as much a way of circumventing regulations restricting the display of sex toys as they were a marketing tactic, but their popularity quickly grew and Ann Summers now employs over 7,500 Party Organisers, coordinated from the Head Office in Surrey. There were around 4,000 Ann Summers parties every week in the UK in 2003.

The Ann Summers parties include the presentation of sex toys and lingerie in the informal setting of someone&#x27;s home, usually the home of one of the attendees. It can also involve the perusal of a catalogue, and often there are party games.

==Controversy==
Due to the adult nature of the business, Ann Summers has frequently faced opposition, both legal and social. For example, in 2003, they won a legal battle to advertise for employees in job centres and an ASA complaint was rejected.

They have also encountered opposition to their advertising. The company received a letter of complaint from Buckingham Palace, due to a non-endorsed advertisement featuring the Queen.

In 2003, the company&#x27;s payments to party organisers were discussed by a number of media sources.

In 2004, two complaints were upheld by the ASA. The ASA decided that the first ad was degrading to women, offensive and unsuitable for use as a poster. In the second case the ASA ruled that the use of a reference to the nursery rhyme &quot;Ride a Cock Horse&quot; was likely to attract the attention of children and that the advertisement was unsuitable for the medium in which it appeared.

An Ann Summers lingerie factory in Portsmouth closed in 2005, with over 50 redundancies.

Additionally, Ann Summers in Perth, Scotland, was forced to close after the local people complained about the store (mostly from parents embarrassed by questions raised by their children), which also led to other problems with the store. Perth was originally the only UK town where an Ann Summers store failed to take off. However, in May 2007 the Middleton Grange, Hartlepool store which opened in November 2005 was closed after less than two years of trading due to poor sales.

In 2006, Muslim groups complained about the release of a blow-up doll named Mustafa Shag, claiming that the doll was offensive to Muslims as Mustafa was one of the names given to the Prophet Mohamed.

In 2007, the company faced legal issues with Apple Inc due to its release of an electronic add-on to music players called the . The company has not backed down despite cease-and-desist orders by Apple. Also, a former director, who is now a Beate Uhse AG employee is pursuing a libel claim against Jacqueline Gold. An advertisement was banned from the London Underground in the same year.

In 2010, Ann Summers&#x27; Halloween advertisement was banned by the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre, which decided the advertisement used &quot;fairly overt sexual references in terms of sound effects.&quot;

In 2011 an advertising campaign which featured a pastiche of a Marks and Spencer advertisement was withdrawn after a threat of legal action by M&amp;S.

<text>Male circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin (prepuce) from the human penis.

There is substantial disagreement amongst bioethicists and theologians over the practice of circumcision, with many believing that the routine circumcision of neonates for health purposes is a cost-ineffective and ethically-problematic intervention in developed countries, while circumcision on a consenting adult is generally viewed as a morally permissible action. Positions taken on the issue are heavily influenced by prevalence in the given area, religion, and culture. Some medical associations take the position that circumcision is an infringement of the child&#x27;s autonomy and should be deferred until he is capable of making the decision himself. Others state that parents should be allowed to determine what is in his best interest.

== Background ==
There is a long-running and vigorous debate over ethical concerns regarding circumcision, particularly neonatal circumcision for reasons other than intended direct medical benefit. There are three parties involved in the decision to circumcise a minor: the minor as the patient, the parents (or other guardians) and the physician. The physician is bound under the ethical principles of beneficence (promoting well-being) and non-maleficence (&quot;first, do no harm&quot;), and so is charged with the responsibility to promote the best interests of the patient while minimizing unnecessary harms. Those involved must weigh the factors of what is in the best interest of the minor against the potential harms of the procedure. Generally, circumcision on a minor is not ethically controversial or legally questionable when there is a clear and pressing medical indication for which it is the accepted best practice to resolve. Where circumcision is the chosen intervention, the physician has an ethical responsibility to ensure the procedure is performed competently and safely to minimize potential harms.

With a newborn involved, the decision is made more complex due to the principles of respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests. A mentally more mature child can understand the issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for the child that precludes the child from making a different decision for himself later. Such a question can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.

Parents are assumed to have the child&#x27;s best interests in mind. Ethically, it is imperative that the medical practitioner inform the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before they are born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to have a significant effect on the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents&#x27; desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child&#x27;s best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure.

The procedure&#x27;s relationship to other prophylactic procedures, along with the concepts of group rights, consent, and religious freedom, have been discussed in academic literature.

== Medical bodies ==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===
The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (2010) released a statement indicating that neonatal male circumcision is &quot;generally considered an ethical procedure&quot;, provided that 1) the child&#x27;s decision makers, typically the parents, are acting in the best interests of the child and are making an informed decision; and 2) the procedure is performed by a competent provider, with sufficient analgesia, and does not unnecessarily harm the child or have substantial risks. They argue that parents should be allowed to be the primary decision-makers because providers may not understand the full psychosocial benefits of circumcision. Additionally, this procedure does not present substantial harm compared to its potential benefits, so parents should be allowed full decision-making capacity as long as they are educated properly. The statement also establishes that &quot;the option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered&quot;, and that &quot;the ethical merit of this option is that it seeks to respect the child&#x27;s physical integrity, and capacity for autonomy by leaving the options open for him to make his own autonomous choice in the future.&quot;

=== Canada ===
The Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) issued a position statement on September 8, 2015, which highlighted the ethical issue surrounding the child&#x27;s inability to give consent. Since children require a substituted decision maker acting in their best interests, they recommend to hold off non-medically indicated procedures, such as circumcision, until children can make their own decisions. Yet the CPS also states that parents of male newborns must receive unbiased information about neonatal circumcision, so that they can weigh specific risks and benefits of circumcision in the context of their own familial, religious and cultural beliefs.

=== Denmark ===
The Danish Medical Association (&quot;Lægeforeningen&quot;) has released a statement (2016) regarding the circumcision of boys under the age of eighteen years. The organization says that the decision to circumcise should be &quot;an informed personal choice&quot; that men should make for themselves in adulthood. According to Dr. Lise Møller, the chairwoman of the Doctors&#x27; Association&#x27;s Ethics Board, allowing the individual to make this decision himself when he is of age respects his right of self-determination.

The Danish College of General Practitioners has defined non-medical circumcision as mutilation.

=== Netherlands ===
The Royal Dutch Medical Association (&quot;Koninklijke Nederlandsche Maatschappij tot bevordering der Geneeskunst&quot;) (KNMG) and several Dutch specialist medical societies published a statement of position regarding circumcision of male children on 27 May 2010. The KNMG argues against circumcising male minors due to lack of evidence the procedure is useful or necessary, its associated risks, and violate the child&#x27;s autonomy. They recommend deferring circumcision until the child is old enough to decide for himself. The KNMG questions why the ethics regarding male genital alterations should be viewed any differently from female genital alterations, when there are mild forms of female genital alterations like pricking the clitoral hood without removing any tissue or removing the clitoral hood altogether. They have expressed opposition to both male circumcision and all forms of female circumcision; they do not advocate a prohibition of male circumcision, even though they argue that there are good reasons for it to be banned, and prefer that circumcisions be done by doctors instead of illegal, underground circumcisers.

The Dutch Council on Public Health and Care does not agree with the Royal Dutch Medical Association and states that they wrongly do not distinguish between male and female circumcision and that they do not take into account the freedom of religion and the right of parents to raise their children according to their own beliefs or convictions.

=== Nordic countries ===

In 2013, children&#x27;s ombudsmen from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland, along with the Chair of the Danish Children&#x27;s Council and the children&#x27;s spokesperson for Greenland, passed a resolution that emphasized the decision to be circumcised should belong to the individual, who should be able to give informed consent.

The Nordic Association of Clinical Sexologists supports the position of the Nordic Association of Ombudsmen who reason that circumcision violates the individual&#x27;s human rights by denying the male child his ability to make the decision for himself.

The medical doctors at Sørland Hospital in Kristiansand, Southern Norway have all refused to perform circumcisions on boys, citing reasons of conscience.

=== United Kingdom ===
The medical ethics committee of the British Medical Association also reviewed the ethics behind circumcision. Since circumcision has associated risks with, in their view, no unequivocally proven medical benefits, they advise physicians to keep up with clinical evidence and only perform this procedure if it is in the child&#x27;s best interest. They say the procedure is a cultural and religious practice, which may be an important ritual for the child&#x27;s incorporation into the group. They recognize that parents have the authority to make choices for their child, and they emphasize it is important for parents to act in their child&#x27;s best interest. They report that views vary in their community about the benefits and risks of the procedure, and there is no clear policy for this situation.

Commenting on the development of the 2003 British Medical Association guidance on circumcision, Mussell (2004) reports that debate in society is highly polarized, and he attributes it to the different faiths and cultures that make up BMA. He identifies this as a difficulty in achieving consensus within the medical ethics committee. Arguments put forward in discussions, according to Mussell, included the social and cultural benefits of circumcision, the violation of the child&#x27;s rights, and the violation of the child&#x27;s autonomy.

==== Adult circumcision ====
In a paper published June 2006, the British Medical Association Committee on Medical Ethics does not consider circumcision of an adult male to be controversial, provided that the adult is of sound mind and grants his personal consent after receiving all material information regarding the known risks, disadvantages, and potential benefits to be derived from the surgical operation.

Circumcision of adults as a public health measure for the purpose of reducing the spread of HIV also involves ethical concerns such as informed consent and concerns about reducing attention paid to other measures. According to the CDC website, research has documented a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS transmission when a male is circumcised.

==== Child circumcision ====
In the same British Medical Association paper, circumcision of a child to treat a clear and present medical indication after a trial of conservative treatment also is not considered to be ethically questionable, provided that a suitable has granted surrogate consent after receiving all material information regarding the known risks, disadvantages, and potential benefits to be derived from the surgical operation. The BMA 2006 viewpoint called circumcision of neonates and children “increasingly controversial”.

==== Criticism and revision of BMA statement ====
The BMA statement of 2003 took the position that non-therapeutic circumcision of children is lawful in the United Kingdom. British law professors Fox and Thomson (2005), citing the House of Lords case of &quot;R v Brown&quot;, challenged this statement. They argued that consent cannot make an unlawful act lawful. The BMA issued a revised statement in 2006 and now reports the controversy regarding the lawfulness of non-therapeutic child circumcision and recommends that doctors obtain the consent of &quot;both&quot; parents before performing non-therapeutic circumcision of a male minor. The revised statement now mentions that male circumcision is generally assumed to be lawful provided that it is performed competently, is believed to be in the child&#x27;s best interests, and there is valid consent from both parent or the child if it is capable of expressing a view.

=== United States ===
==== American Academy of Pediatrics ====
The circumcision policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (enacted 2012, expired 2017) stated: &quot;Systematic evaluation of English-language peer-reviewed literature from 1995 through 2010 indicates that preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure.&quot; They wrote that the decision of whether or not to circumcise should be made by parents after considering the medical benefits and risks, along with &quot;religious, ethical, and cultural beliefs and practices&quot;, and that the medical benefits are such that third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns is warranted. The policy statement also noted that the risk of complications is considerably lower when circumcision is performed during the newborn period, as opposed to when it is performed later in life. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists had endorsed the American Academy of Pediatrics&#x27; circumcision policy statement.

=== Criticism ===
The most recent American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) position statement on male circumcision (enacted 2012) has attracted significant critical comment, including from the AAP itself.

In a dissenting paper, Frisch et al. (2013) write: &quot;Circumcision fails to meet the criteria to serve as a preventive measure for UTI ... As a preventive measure for penile cancer, circumcision also fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine ... circumcision for HIV protection in Western countries fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine ... Circumcision fails to meet the commonly accepted criteria for the justification of preventive medical procedures in children.&quot; Frisch et al. further comment: &quot;The AAP report lacks a serious discussion of the central ethical dilemma with, on one side, parents&#x27; right to act in the best interest of the child on the basis of cultural, religious, and health-related beliefs and wishes and, on the other side, infant boys&#x27; basic right to physical integrity in the absence of compelling reasons for surgery. Physical integrity is one of the most fundamental and inalienable rights a child has. Physicians and their professional organizations have a professional duty to protect this right, irrespective of the gender of the child.&quot;

Van Howe and Svoboda (2013) criticize the AAP&#x27;s statement because they believed that it failed to include important points, inaccurately analyzed and interpret current medical literature, and made unsupported conclusions.

Frisch et al. (2013) cited the difference of the AAP&#x27;s statements in comparison to other Western countries, such as Canada, Australia, and various European countries. They attribute this to cultural bias since non-therapeutic male circumcision is prevalent in the United States. They also criticized the strength of the health benefits the statement had claimed, such as protection from HIV and other STIs. The American Academy of Pediatrics responded that because about half of American males are circumcised and half are not, there may be a more tolerant view concerning circumcision in the US, but that if there is any cultural bias among the AAP taskforce who wrote the Circumcision Policy statement, it is much less important than the bias Frisch et al. may hold because of clear prejudices against the practice that can be found in Europe. The AAP then explained why they reached conclusions regarding the health benefits of circumcision that are different from the ones reached by some of their European counterparts.

==== American Medical Association Journal of Ethics ====
In August 2017, the American Medical Association &quot;Journal of Ethics&quot; featured two separate articles challenging the morality of performing non-therapeutic infant circumcision.

Svoboda argues against non-therapeutic circumcision. He states that this decision should be considered in the context of benefit vs risk of harm, rather than simply risk-benefit due to the non-therapeutic nature of the procedure. He states that benefits do not outweigh the risks, and also claims that foreskin removal should be considered a sexual harm. He also goes on to conclude that non-therapeutic circumcision largely violates the physician&#x27;s duty to respect a patient&#x27;s autonomy since many procedures take place before a patient is able to freely give consent himself.

Reis and Reis&#x27;s article explore the role physicians play in neonatal circumcision. They state that if physicians outline all the currently known risks and benefits of the procedure to the parents and believes the procedure is indeed medically indicated, they cannot be held accountable for any harm from the procedure. They still advise against physicians recommending unnecessary, irreversible surgeries, which is a category circumcision falls in frequently.

=== JME symposium on circumcision, June 2004 ===
The &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; published a &quot;symposium on circumcision&quot; in its June 2004 issue. The symposium published the original version (2003) of the BMA policy statement and six articles by various individuals with a wide spectrum of views on the ethicality of circumcision of male minors. In the introduction, Holm (2004) argues that we do not have the evidence available in order to truly assess the ethics behind circumcision, identifying that we do not have evidence surrounding the &quot;effects of early circumcision on adult sexual function and satisfaction&quot;. Therefore, Holm states until this data is available this debate cannot be concluded as there will always be an opposition to circumcision driven by &quot;cultural prejudices&quot;.

Hutson (2004) concludes that he does not believe in the risk of circumcision without reason, stating that &quot;no operation should be done if there is no disease&quot;. He justifies this through arguing that surgery is only condoned when the risk of the disease is greater than the surgery itself.

Short (2004) disputes Hutson&#x27;s claims and argues that male circumcision has future prophylactic benefits that make it worthwhile. He concludes that there can be no debate about male circumcision, arguing that &quot;it can bring major improvements to both male and female reproductive health&quot;. He believes that as a result of living in a developing world, we have the facilities that enable this surgery to take place without &quot;physical cruel nor potentially dangerous&quot;.

Viens (2004) contends that &quot;we do not know in any robust or determinate sense that infant male circumcision is harmful in itself, nor can we say the same with respect to its purported harmful consequences.&quot; He suggests that one must distinguish between practices that are grievously harmful and those that enhance a child&#x27;s cultural or religious identity. He suggests that medical professionals, and bioethicists especially, &quot;must take as their starting point the fact that reasonable people will disagree about what is valuable and what is harmful.&quot;

Hellsten (2004) describes arguments in support of circumcision as &quot;rationalisations&quot;, and states that infant circumcision can be &quot;clearly condemned as a violation of children&#x27;s rights whether or not they cause direct pain.&quot; He argues that to question the ethical acceptability of the practice, &quot;we need to focus on child rights protection.&quot; Hellsten concludes, &quot;Rather, with further education and knowledge the cultural smokescreen around the real reasons for the maintenance of the practice can be overcome in all societies no matter what their cultural background.

Mussell (2004) examined the process by which the BMA arrived at a position on non-therapeutic circumcision male minors, when the organisation had groups and individuals of different ethnicities, religion, culture, and widely varying viewpoints.

Arguments were put forward that non-therapeutic male circumcision is a net &quot;benefit&quot; for some because it helps them to integrate in the community.

Arguments were also put forward that non-therapeutic male circumcision is a net &quot;harm&quot; because it is seen as a breach of children&#x27;s rights—the right of the child to be free from physical intrusion and the right of the child to choose in the future. This argument was given emphasis by Britain&#x27;s incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998.

The BMA produced a document that set forth legal and ethical concerns but left the final decision on whether or not to perform a non-therapeutic circumcision to the attending physician.

The last document published by the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; in its symposium on circumcision was a reprint of the BMA statement: &quot;The law and ethics of male circumcision: guidance for doctors (2003).

=== Journal of Medical Ethics circumcision issue, July 2013 ===
The &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; devoted the entire July 2013 issue to the controversial issue of non-therapeutic circumcision of male children. The numerous articles represent a diverse variety of views.

=== Other views ===
Povenmire (1988) argues that parents should not have the power to consent to neonatal non-therapeutic circumcision.

Richards (1996) argues that parents only have power to consent to therapeutic procedures.

Somerville (2000) argues that the nature of the medical benefits cited as a justification for infant circumcision are such that the potential medical problems can be avoided or, if they occur, treated in far less invasive ways than circumcision. She states that the removal of healthy genital tissue from a minor should not be subject to parental discretion, or that physicians who perform the procedure are not acting in accordance with their ethical duties to the patient, regardless of parental consent.
Canning (2002) commented that &quot;[i]f circumcision becomes less commonly performed in North America ... the legal system may no longer be able to ignore the conflict between the practice of circumcision and the legal and ethical duties of medical specialists.&quot;

Benatar and Benatar (2003) argue that &quot;it is far from obvious that circumcision reduces sexual pleasure,&quot; and that &quot;it is far from clear that non-circumcision leaves open a future person&#x27;s options in every regard.&quot; They continue: &quot;It does preserve the option of future circumcised or uncircumcised status. But it makes other options far more difficult to exercise. Transforming from the uncircumcised to the circumcised state will have psychological and other costs for an adult that are absent for a child. ... Nor are these costs &#x27;negligible&#x27;, ... At the very least, they are not more negligible than the risks and costs of circumcision.&quot;

The Committee on Medical Ethics of the British Medical Association (2003) published a paper to guide doctors on the law and ethics of circumcision. It advises medical doctors to proceed on a case by case basis to determine the best interests of the child before deciding to perform a circumcision. The doctor must consider the child&#x27;s legal and human rights in making his or her determination. It states that a physician has a right to refuse to perform a non-therapeutic circumcision. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia took a similar position.

Fox and Thomson (2005) state that in the absence of &quot;unequivocal evidence of medical benefit&quot;, it is &quot;ethically inappropriate to subject a child to the acknowledged risks of infant male circumcision.&quot; Thus, they believe, &quot;the emerging consensus, whereby parental choice holds sway, appears ethically indefensible&quot;.

The Belgian Federal Consultative Committee for Bioethics (&quot;Comité Consultatif de Bioéthique de Belgique&quot;) (2017), after a three-year study, has ruled that circumcision of male children for non-therapeutic purposes is unethical in Belgium. The process is irreversible, has no medical justification in most cases, and is performed on minors unable to give their own permission, according to the committee. Paul Schotsmans of the University of Leuven, on behalf of the committee, noted &quot;the child&#x27;s right to physical integrity, which is protected by the International Treaty on the Rights of the Child, and in particular its protection from physical injury.&quot; The Belgian minister of health, Maggie De Block, replied that the federal institute for health insurance cannot check and know whether in (individual cases) a circumcision is medically justified or not and that she will continue to reimburse circumcision of minors as the safety of the child is her primary concern and she wants to avoid botched circumcisions by non-medical circumcisers.

== HIV prevention ==

The World Health Organization (2007) states that provision of circumcision should be consistent with &quot;medical ethics and human rights principles.&quot; They state that &quot;[i]nformed consent, confidentiality and absence of coercion should be assured. ... Parents who are responsible for providing consent, including for the circumcision of male infants, should be given sufficient information regarding the benefits and risks of the procedure in order to determine what is in the best interests of the child.&quot; Since babies and children are not sexually active, sexually-transmitted HIV infection is not a relevant concern. Critics of non-therapeutic circumcision argue that advocating circumcision to prevent HIV infection may detract from other efforts to prevent the spread of the virus such as using condoms. If the adult chooses to remain celibate or if a couple remain monogamous, or if HIV is eliminated by the time the child is an adult, the sexual reduction surgery would not have been needed. Moreover, they argue that circumcising a child purportedly to partially protect him from HIV infection in adulthood may be seen as granting permission to engage in dangerous sexual practices. Obviously baby boys do not need such protection and can choose for themselves as consenting adults if they want a circumcision. This stance does not take into account the fact that adult men may already have contracted HIV before getting circumcised.

The UK National Health Service (NHS) has stated that the African studies have &quot;important implications for the control of sexually transmitted infections in Africa&quot;, but that in the United Kingdom practicing safe sex including condom use is the best way to prevent sexually-transmitted disease when having sex.

== Surrogate consent ==
Patient autonomy is an important principle of medical ethics. Some believe that consent for a non-therapeutic operation offends the principle of autonomy, when granted by a surrogate.

Since children, and especially infants, are legally incompetent to grant informed consent for medical or surgical treatment, that consent must be granted by a surrogate—someone designated to act on behalf of the child-patient, if treatment is to occur.

A surrogate&#x27;s powers to grant consent are more circumscribed than the powers granted to a competent individual acting on his own behalf. A surrogate may only act in the best interests of the patient. A surrogate may not put a child at risk for religious reasons. A surrogate may grant consent for a medical procedure that has &quot;no&quot; medical indication &quot;only&quot; if it is the child&#x27;s best interests.

The attending physician must provide the surrogate with all material information concerning the proposed benefits, risks, advantages, and drawbacks of the proposed treatment or procedure.

The Committee on Bioethics of the AAP (1995) states that parents may only grant surrogate informed permission for diagnosis and treatment with the assent of the child whenever appropriate.

There is an unresolved question whether surrogates may grant effective consent for non-therapeutic child circumcision. Richards (1996) argues that parents may only consent to medical care, so are not empowered to grant consent for non-therapeutic circumcision of a child because it is not medical care. The Canadian Paediatric Society (2015) recommends that circumcisions done in the absence of a medical indication or for personal reasons &quot;should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices.&quot;

Regardless of these issues, the general practice of the medical community in the United States is to receive surrogate informed consent or permission from parents or legal guardians for non-therapeutic circumcision of children.

<text>BBC Radio Cymru is a Welsh language radio station owned and operated by BBC Cymru Wales, a division of the BBC. It broadcasts across Wales on FM, DAB, digital TV and BBC Sounds.

The station broadcasts general factual and entertainment programming for hours a day from 5:30am to midnight with overnight programming simulcast from the BBC World Service after closedown. 

Its sister station, BBC Radio Cymru 2, providing separate music-led programming at certain hours of the day, broadcasts on digital and online platforms.

The managing editor of BBC Radio Cymru is Dafydd Meredydd, a former presenter and producer.

==Overview==
BBC Radio Cymru began broadcasting on the first Monday morning of year on 3 January 1977. Its first programme was an extended news bulletin presented at 6:45am by Gwyn Llewellyn and Geraint Jones. This was followed at 7am by the first edition of the breakfast magazine show &quot;&quot;, presented by Hywel Gwynfryn with contributions from a network of local reporters in studios across Wales. The first record played on Radio Cymru was &quot;Plas-y-Bryniau&quot; by Hergest.

The station was the first broadcasting outlet dedicated wholly to programmes in Welsh, allowing much more airtime for such output than had previously been available on the old Radio 4 Wales (or its predecessors the Welsh Home Service and, before that, the BBC Welsh Regional Programme).

Initially, the service was part-time and restricted to breakfast shows, extended news bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime &amp; early evening and a number of off-peak opt-outs from a sustaining Radio 4 Wales feed.

In November 1979, Radio Cymru&#x27;s programming was expanded to 65 hours a week, introducing mid-morning output on weekdays, along with a growing line-up of dramas, light entertainment and documentaries. The network continued to expand over the next two decades before achieving a continuous service of up to 20 hours a day.

Later developments in the 21st century saw Radio Cymru introducing a nightly youth strand, &quot;C2&quot;, and regional opt-outs for South West Wales, which were axed in 2008 but later reintroduced to provide live commentary of Swansea City A.F.C. matches. The station has also been streaming online since January 2005.

Radio Cymru is similar in format to many &quot;general&quot; radio stations, with news programmes at breakfast (&#x27;, &#x27;First Post&#x27;), lunchtime (&#x27; – a debate-centred programme), and drive-time (&quot;, &#x27;Afternoon Post&#x27;); together with presenter-driven sequences mixing music with guests, calls from listeners and competitions. Radio Cymru also produces drama, features, current affairs and sports programming.

Over the years, it has done much to promote the language, with its sports commentators coining new terms which later became accepted by Welsh linguists. One of its more unusualand longest-runningprogrammes is &quot;, a poetry competition in which teams must come up with poetry in specific styles on specific topics.

In 2018, following a three-month pilot service, a second station - BBC Radio Cymru 2 - was launched on a permanent basis. Initially providing a music and entertainment alternative to its breakfast news programme, the station gradually expanded its own programming while continuing to simulcast output from the main Radio Cymru service. In March 2024, the station expanded its bespoke output from 15 to 60 hours a week, after receiving approval from the broadcast regulator OFCOM to become a fully-fledged public service radio station.

==Listening figures==
According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 95,000 listeners and a listening share of 2.2%, as of December 2023. The average number of hours per listener is 11.5 hours a week.

==Presenters==
Notable current presenters include:
*Shân Cothi (&quot;Bore Cothi&quot;)
*Caryl Parry Jones (Monday-Thursday nights)
*Huw Stephens (Thursday evenings)

==Transmission==
BBC Radio Cymru is broadcast across Wales FM and DAB. It is also available on Freeview in Wales, throughout the UK on Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media and internationally online on BBC Sounds. As Radio Cymru was created from an opt-out of BBC Radio 4, it inherited the FM transmitters previously used by Radio 4 across Wales. At the time of the station&#x27;s launch, it was the only radio service in the UK broadcasting solely on FM.

<text>Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC; , &quot;RDDC&quot;) is the science and technology organization of the Department of National Defence (DND), whose purpose is to provide the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), other government departments, and public safety and national security communities with knowledge and technology.

DRDC has approximately 1,400 employees across seven research centres within Canada.

== History ==
After the First World War, national research and development in Canada was organized under the National Research Council (NRC). The NRC was founded in 1925 based on a wartime British recommendation to establish military laboratories in Canada, but by that time the main priorities were developing domestic university and industrial research and civilian projects. Greater interest in military applied research arrived in 1935 when Major-General Andrew McNaughton became President of the NRC. In the period before the Second World War, the NRC undertook research in radar, aviation medicine, artillery, aircraft, gas masks, and metallic magnesium production. Chalmers Jack Mackenzie became acting President at the onset of the Second World War when McNaughton assumed an operational command within the Canadian Army, formally succeeding McNaughton in 1944.

Following the fall of France in June 1940, the NRC assumed control of all Canadian scientific research and became responsible for applying it toward military applications. Laboratories and facilities were established by the NRC and the Canadian Armed Forces; biological and chemical warfare laboratories cooperated closely with Allied counterparts.

In 1944, Chalmers Mackenzie and the armed forces began considering the issue of post-war military research, and concluded that a separate military research organization was required. The result was the creation of the &quot;Defence Research Board&quot; (DRB) within the Department of National Defence (DND) in April 1947, which took over coordinating defence research from the NRC and advising DND on scientific matters. The overall organization of defence research continued to mimic the NRC. The DRB was—as envisioned by proposals in 1945—an interim solution; creating an organization within DND required minimal political action compared to creating a new government department that would subsume both the NRC and defence research. Omond Solandt was the first Chairman of the DRB. The DRB received seven existing NRC facilities.

The DRB was the last part of DND to adapt to the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces of 1968. DRB began transitioning to the new structure in 1974, and dissolved in 1977. Six of the seven DRB research establishments were transferred to the newly created &quot;Defence Research and Development Branch&quot; (DRDB) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).

In the 1990s, budget cuts and the complexity of greater reliance on cheaper contracting drove a review of the organization of defence research. In 2000, the DRDB was replaced by &quot;Defence Research and Development Canada&quot; (DRDC) which was–like the DRB before–a DND agency.

== Research centres ==

=== Atlantic Research Centre ===
Located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Atlantic Research Centre conducts research and development activities related to the maritime defence and security domains, but also to the air and land environments. The Centre traces its formation to 1944 when it was established as the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic (DREA) by the Royal Canadian Navy. DREA was one of the originating organizations that came together in 1947 to form the Defense Research Board which later became DRDC.

The Centre provides expertise in the following areas:
* antisubmarine warfare
* mine and torpedo defence
* shipboard command and control
* naval platform technology

* Load Carriage Robot – an instrumented articulated manikin that mimics the movement of the human torso.
* A Cold Exposure Survival Model (CESM) used in Search and Rescue (SAR) Operations.
* A Heat Stress Calculator for firefighters used throughout Ontario.
* The New Wind Chill Equivalent Temperature Chart, used throughout North America.

=== Suffield Research Centre ===
Located in Alberta, the DRDC Suffield Research Centre is a Canadian centre of excellence for chemical and biological defence and has research programs in blast, casualty management, and autonomous systems. The centre’s work feeds into the combined national effort to keep Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) safe from the devastating consequences chemical (C), biological (B), radiological (R), nuclear (N), and explosive (E) threats could have on human health, the environment, and major infrastructure.

DRDC operations in Suffield include two unique national assets: Experimental Proving Ground (EPG) and the Counter Terrorism and Technology Centre (CTTC). The EPG is Canada’s only proving ground of its kind for military research and development. Its immense land space (470 km2), air space, and 105 realty assets (specialized laboratories, trial sites and facilities) make it a research and development resource to advance DRDC/DND’s program. It is also accessible to defence industry partners upon request. CTTC offers realistic training (over 2,200 CAF and First Responders per year) helping them respond safely and effectively to incidents involving CBRNE threats.

The centre provides expertise in the following areas:
* C/B detection &amp; forensics;
* C/B protection technologies and systems;
* Blast threat mitigation and assessment;
* Advanced energetics;

<doc id="1210962" wikidata="Q1150489" url="?curid=1210962" title="Nummular dermatitis">
<text>Nummular dermatitis (commonly known as nummular eczema or discoid eczema) is one of the many forms of dermatitis. It is characterized by round or oval-shaped itchy lesions. The name comes from the Latin word &quot;nummus,&quot; which means &quot;coin.&quot;

==Signs and symptoms==
Nummular dermatitis is characterized by chronic or relapsing itchy coin-sized ovoid-shaped red plaques. They can occur on the trunk, limbs, face, and hands.

== Causes ==
Many contact sensitizers or irritants are known to cause contact dermatitis superimposed on nummular dermatitis. Studies have implicated nickel, cobalt, chromate, and fragrance as likely culprits. Xerosis, or dehydration of skin is also a likely cause. Infection with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; bacteria or &quot;Candida albicans&quot; may also play a role.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of nummular dermatitis is largely via clinical observation. Biopsies are typically not necessary, and cannot be used to rule out other atopic dermatitis or other eczemas. However, patch testing may be employed to rule out irritants (contact dermatitis) as a cause. In children, nummular dermatitis is commonly confused with tinea corporis.

==Treatment==

One of the keys to treatment and prevention involves keeping the skin moisturized. Lotions, creams, and bath oils may help prevent an outbreak. If the condition flares up, a common treatment involves the application of topical corticosteroids. Oral antihistamines may help lessen itching. Avoidance of irritants is a common strategy. More severe cases sometimes respond to ultraviolet light treatment. If the condition occurs only during the sun-less winter months then vitamin D supplement might be an effective treatment.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of nummular dermatitis in the United States is approximately 2 per 1,000. It is considered a disease of adulthood, for it is rare in children.

<text>BBC Radio Foyle is a BBC Northern Ireland local radio station, serving County Londonderry in Northern Ireland. It is named after the River Foyle which flows through Derry, the city where the station is based.

It is an opt-out from BBC Radio&#x27;s main Northern Ireland service, BBC Radio Ulster. Recent budget cuts saw some reduction in local programming, which now only airs during the week - currently airing between 8:00am and 4:00pm, along with some local evening programming. At all other times, and throughout the weekend, the station&#x27;s frequencies carry BBC Radio Ulster.

==Broadcasting==

The station broadcasts from BBC&#x27;s Northland Road studios on 93.1 FM in Derry. It was available on 792 kHz medium wave until 6 May 2021.

There is also a small television studio based there used for interviews with the interviewee sitting in front of a CSO screen which normally has a live view of Derry. Since it broadcasts from a point close to the border between County Londonderry and County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, it includes some coverage of the latter county.

==Digital==
BBC Radio Foyle is available online and is carried on Freeview in Northern Ireland (occupying the slot held by BBC Radio nan Gàidheal in Scotland and by BBC Radio Cymru in Wales). It was not initially available on DAB digital radio, however; the Northern Ireland multiplex licence only requires carriage of Radio Ulster.

In June 2010, the BBC announced a trial scheme under which Radio Foyle would be available on DAB as a part-time sidecar station to Radio Ulster, using a similar format as the part-time longwave-programming optouts of BBC Radio 4 on the BBC National DAB multiplex. During this trial, the bitrate of Radio Ulster would drop during Foyle&#x27;s separate broadcast hours, with Foyle carried as a split audio stream in the remaining space; outside of split shows, the full bitrate would revert to Radio Ulster.

When the Digital One ensemble commenced broadcasting in Northern Ireland certain stations that used Digital One in the rest of the UK left the Northern Ireland ensemble, leaving space for Radio Foyle to broadcast in Stereo without the need for the Radio Ulster capacity to be split.

Following the closure of the medium wave services of BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Foyle on 6 May 2021, the digital frequencies of BBC Radio Foyle have been used for split sports programming formerly broadcast on 1341kHz and 792kHz.

<text>Abner Smith Lipscomb (February 10, 1789, in Abbeville District, South Carolina – December 8, 1856, in Austin, Texas) was an American and Texan lawyer and judge. He was also appointed Secretary of State for the Republic of Texas under the administration of President Mirabeau B. Lamar.

Lipscomb studied law in the office of John C. Calhoun and passed the bar in 1810. In 1811, he began practice in St. Stephens, Alabama (then part of the Mississippi Territory.) He served in the Alabama territorial legislature in 1818 and when Alabama became a state in 1819, he then became a circuit judge, which automatically made him a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. When chief justice Clement Clay of the Alabama Supreme Court resigned in 1823, Lipscomb was chosen to be the next chief justice. The court was reorganized in 1832; Lipscomb continued as chief justice of the court, where he served until 1835. Lipscomb served a term in the Alabama state legislature in 1838.

He married on April 13, 1813, at St. Stephens to Elizabeth Gaines, sister of Ann Lawrence Gaines who married their cousin, Col. George Strother Gaines. Col. Gaines&#x27; nephew, Hon. Francis Strother Lyon began the study of law while working for Abner Smith Lipscomb in his office in St. Stephens.

In 1839 Lipscomb moved to the Republic of Texas and established a law practice in Brenham. He was Secretary of State under President Lamar from January 31, 1840, to December 13, 1840. Lipscomb was a member of the Convention of 1845; in 1845, he also served on a committee that wrote a report on the Texas General Land Office. He was appointed an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court in 1846 by Governor James Pinckney Henderson. As he was elected in 1851 and re-elected in 1856, he continued in this post until November 1856. He taught Law courses at Baylor University from 1849 to 1856.

Lipscomb died in Austin, Texas and was buried in the State Cemetery. Lipscomb County, Texas and its county seat of Lipscomb, Texas, are named in honor of him. The remainder of the Lipscomb Family lives in Houston Texas, the patriarch of the Lipscomb clan, Charles Marty Lipscomb, lives in Edinburg Texas with his wife JP Lipscomb and his three children.

<text>BBC Radio nan Gàidheal is a Scottish Gaelic language radio station owned and operated by BBC Scotland, a division of the BBC. The station was launched in 1985 and broadcasts Gaelic-language programming with the simulcast of BBC Radio Scotland. Its headquarters is located on Seaforth Road, Stornoway along with BBC Alba and MG Alba.

The station is available from FM transmitters throughout Scotland: its service licence states that &quot;BBC Radio nan Gàidheal should be available every day for general reception across Scotland on FM&quot;; it can also be heard on digital television platforms, DAB Digital Radio, and online.

BBC Radio nan Gàidheal programmes are also broadcast (with an in-vision graphical overlay) on the Scottish Gaelic digital television channel BBC Alba during periods when the channel is not carrying television programmes.

== History ==
Scottish Gaelic-language programming has been transmitted in Scotland since 1923, and the BBC&#x27;s Gaelic-language department was established in 1935. Launching on 17 May 1976, BBC Radio Highland produced a range of Gaelic programming – – and on 5 October 1979 the Scottish Gaelic service was established in Stornoway. On 1 October 1985, these two separate services united to form . The main base for BBC Radio nan Gàidheal is on Seaforth Road in Stornoway, having moved in June 2014 from the Church Street studios.

== Coverage ==
Radio nan Gàidheal broadcasts for over 90 hours every week, and joins BBC Radio Scotland&#x27;s medium-wave feed when they close transmission. Since BBC Radio Scotland itself joins BBC Radio 5 Live when it signs off, the same applies to as well during parts of Gàidheal&#x27;s sign-off time. now frequently broadcasts important Scottish football matches providing Gaelic commentary.

Radio nan Gàidheal shows are available for 30 days after most recent broadcast on the BBC Sounds app and on the BBC&#x27;s website.

Podcasts of some shows are available from the BBC website and on iTunes for some time after transmission. These include two programmes aimed at learners of the language, entitled &quot;Letter to Gaelic Learners&quot; and &quot;The Little Letter&quot;, the latter being a more basic version of the former. Both letters are also available at learngaelic.net, with transcripts.

== Funding ==
The service budget for 2009 was £3.9m with a change of any more than 10% requiring approval of the BBC Trust. The service budget in 2011 was almost the same as 2009 at £3.8m and requires the same controls as previous licences. This funding comes from the BBC Trust, the governing body of the BBC which is operationally independent of management and external bodies. As is the same with all BBC Radio and TV stations, the channel is funded by the licence fees gathered.

<doc id="1210989" wikidata="Q2213755" url="?curid=1210989" title="This Is My Time (Raven-Symoné album)">
<text>This Is My Time is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter and actress Raven-Symoné, released in the United States on September 21, 2004 by Hollywood Records. The album is her debut with the Disney-owned label and debuted at number 51 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 19,000 copies sold in its first week. It nevertheless became Raven-Symoné&#x27;s best-selling solo album, selling 237,000 copies up to February 2, 2007 in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

== Release and promotion ==
Raven-Symoné released a five-track EP with Hollywood Records on January 1, 2004 prior to the release of &quot;This Is My Time&quot;, containing &quot;Backflip&quot;, &quot;Bump&quot;, &quot;Overloved&quot;, &quot;What Is Love?&quot;, and &quot;Mystify&quot;.

Four songs from the album were incorporated into soundtracks of Walt Disney films: &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; with &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot;; &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; with the album&#x27;s title track; &quot;Ice Princess&quot; with &quot;Bump&quot;; and &quot;Go Figure&quot; with &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Following its release, &quot;This Is My Time&quot; received generally mixed reviews. Both &quot;AllMusic&quot; and &quot;Vibe&quot; gave the album two and a half stars out of five. &quot;Vibe&quot; editor Angie Romero wrote: &quot;Once known as little Olivia from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, Raven-Symoné wants to show the world she’s all grown up. To prove it, she records an album full of pop/R&amp;B hybrids brimming with Hilary Duff–like innocence and sparkling arrangements. Yet, none of [her] composers can compensate for the teen queen’s sub-par singing, the one thing preventing her from getting her full bloom on.&quot; AllMusic critic Jason Thurston found that &quot;Symoné here offers up music that is sweet, melodic, and definitely mature R&amp;B, in the vein of another singer who got her start as a kid on a popular TV show – Janet Jackson.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;This Is My Time&quot; debuted at number 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at number 51 on the official &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 of week dated October 9, 2004, with moderately successful first week sales of 19,000 copies (best debut in the chart to date); making it Raven-Symoné&#x27;s first album to enter the chart in the United States. The set sold 237,000 copies to date in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

== Track listing ==

<doc id="1210990" wikidata="Q605089" url="?curid=1210990" title="Calutron">
<text>A calutron is a mass spectrometer originally designed and used for separating the isotopes of uranium. It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron. Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron, in tribute to Lawrence&#x27;s institution, the University of California, where it was invented. Calutrons were used in the industrial-scale Y-12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The enriched uranium produced was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.

The calutron is a type of sector mass spectrometer, an instrument in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields. The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current. Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses, the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field, causing the beam of particles to separate into several beams by mass, striking the plate at different locations. The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions. During World War II, calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high-purity uranium-235, by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes.

Electromagnetic separation for uranium enrichment was abandoned in the post-war period in favor of the more complicated, but more efficient, gaseous diffusion method. Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan Project were dismantled at the end of the war, some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military, scientific and medical purposes.

== Origins ==
News of the discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, was brought to the United States by Niels Bohr. Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, he theorized that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. To verify this Alfred O. C. Nier at the University of Minnesota used a mass spectrometer to create a microscopic amount of enriched uranium-235 in April 1940. John R. Dunning, Aristid von Grosse and Eugene T. Booth were then able to confirm that Bohr was correct. Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn soon confirmed that more than one neutron was released per fission, which made it almost certain that a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated, and therefore that the development of an atomic bomb was a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries.
At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists—Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within an order of magnitude of 10 kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb. Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research, so the Tizard Mission&#x27;s John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.

A disappointed Oliphant flew to the United States to speak to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 125 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.

The principle of electromagnetic separation is that charged ions are deflected by a magnetic field, and lighter ones are deflected more than heavy ones. The reason the Maud Committee, and later its American counterpart, the S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), had passed over the electromagnetic method was that while the mass spectrometer was capable of separating isotopes, it produced very low yields. The reason for this was the so-called space charge limitation. Positive ions have positive charge, so they tend to repel each other, which causes the beam to scatter. Drawing on his experience with the precise control of charged-particle beams from his work with his invention, the cyclotron, Lawrence suspected that the air molecules in the vacuum chamber would neutralize the ions, and create a focused beam. Oliphant inspired Lawrence to convert his old cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation.
The 37-inch cyclotron at Berkeley was dismantled on 24 November 1941, and its magnet used to create the first calutron. Its name came from California University and cyclotron. The work was initially funded by the Radiation Laboratory from its own resources, with a $5,000 grant from the Research Corporation. In December Lawrence received a $400,000 grant from the S-1 Uranium Committee. The calutron consisted of an ion source, in the form of a box with a slit in it and hot filaments inside. Uranium tetrachloride was ionized by the filament, and then passed through a slot into a vacuum chamber. The magnet was then used to deflect the ion beam by 180°. The enriched and depleted beams went into collectors.

When the calutron was first operated on 2 December 1941, just days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, a uranium beam intensity of 5 microamperes (μA) was received by the collector. Lawrence&#x27;s hunch about the effect of the air molecules in the vacuum chamber was confirmed. A nine-hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms (μg) of uranium enriched to 25% uranium-235, about ten times as much as Nier had produced. By February, improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1,400 μA beam. That month, 75 μg samples enriched to 30% were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.

Other researchers also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a group led by Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, they were able to separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence&#x27;s in Berkeley.

== Research ==
While the process had been demonstrated to work, considerable effort was still required before a prototype could be tested in the field. Lawrence assembled a team of physicists to tackle the problems, including David Bohm, Edward Condon, Donald Cooksey, A. Theodore Forrester, Irving Langmuir, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, Frank Oppenheimer, J. Robert Oppenheimer, William E. Parkins, Bernard Peters and Joseph Slepian. In November 1943 they were joined by a British Mission headed by Oliphant that included fellow Australian physicists Harrie Massey and Eric Burhop, and British physicists such as Joan Curran and Thomas Allibone.
Lawrence had a large cyclotron under construction at Berkeley, one with a magnet. This was converted into a calutron that was switched on for the first time on 26 May 1942. Like the 37-inch version, it looked like a giant C when viewed from above. The operator sat in the open end, whence the temperature could be regulated, the position of the electrodes adjusted, and even components replaced through an airlock while it was running. The new, more powerful calutron was not used to produce enriched uranium, but for experiments with multiple ion sources. This meant having more collectors, but it multiplied the throughput.

The problem was that the beams interfered with each other, producing a series of oscillations called hash. An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference, resulting in reasonably good beams being produced, in September 1942. Robert Oppenheimer and Stan Frankel invented the magnetic shim, a device used to adjust the homogeneity of a magnetic field. These were sheets of iron about in width that were bolted to the top and bottom of the vacuum tank. The effect of the shims was to slightly increase the magnetic field in such a way as to help focus the ion beam. Work would continue on the shims through 1943. The main calutron patents were &quot;Methods of and apparatus for separating materials&quot; (Lawrence), &quot;Magnetic shims&quot; (Oppenheimer and Frankel), and &quot;Calutron system&quot; (Lawrence).

Burhop and Bohm later studied the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion. Their papers on the properties of plasmas under magnetic containment would find usage in the post-war world in research into controlled nuclear fusion. Other technical problems were more mundane but no less important. Although the beams had low intensity, they could, over many hours of operation, still melt the collectors. A water cooling system was therefore added to the collectors and the tank liner. Procedures were developed for cleaning the &quot;gunk&quot; that condensed inside the vacuum tank. A particular problem was blockage of the slits by &quot;crud&quot;, which caused the ion beams to lose focus, or stop entirely.

The chemists had to find a way of producing quantities of uranium tetrachloride () from uranium oxide. (Nier had used uranium bromide.) Initially, they produced it by using hydrogen to reduce uranium trioxide () to uranium dioxide (), which was then reacted with carbon tetrachloride () to produce uranium tetrachloride. Charles A. Kraus proposed a better method for large-scale production that involved reacting the uranium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at high temperature and pressure. This produced uranium pentachloride () and phosgene (). While nowhere near as nasty as the uranium hexafluoride used by the gaseous diffusion process, uranium tetrachloride is hygroscopic, so work with it had to be undertaken in gloveboxes that were kept dry with phosphorus pentoxide (). The presence of phosgene, a lethal gas responsible for 85,000 deaths as a chemical weapon during World War I, required that the chemists wear gas masks when handling it.

Of the $19.6 million spent on research and development of the electromagnetic process, $18 million (92 percent) was spent at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and further work conducted at Brown University, Johns Hopkins University and Purdue University, and by the Tennessee Eastman corporation. During 1943, the emphasis shifted from research to development, engineering, and the training of workers to operate the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By the middle of 1944, there were nearly 1,200 people working at the Radiation Laboratory.

== Design ==
Much of the great progress on the electromagnetic process can be attributed to Lawrence&#x27;s leadership style. His audacity, optimism and enthusiasm were contagious. His staff put in long hours, and University of California administrators sliced through red tape despite not knowing what the project was about. Government officials began to view the development of atomic bombs in time to affect the outcome of the war as a genuine possibility. Vannevar Bush, the director of the OSRD, which was overseeing the project, visited Berkeley in February 1942, and found the atmosphere there &quot;stimulating&quot; and &quot;refreshing&quot;. On 9 March 1942, he reported to the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, that it might be possible to produce enough material for a bomb by mid-1943, based on new estimates from Robert Oppenheimer that the critical mass of a sphere of pure uranium-235 was between 2.0 and 2.5 kilograms.
The experiments with the 184-inch magnet led to the construction of a prototype calutron called the XA. It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side, with four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, where the other Manhattan Project uranium separation facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security. Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley. The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection. The 25 June meeting also designated Stone &amp; Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering.

The Army assumed responsibility for the Manhattan Project on 17 September 1942, with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., as director, although the Army did not formally take over the contracts with the University of California from the OSRD until 1 May 1943. Major Thomas T. Crenshaw, Jr., became California Area Engineer in August 1942, with Captain Harold A. Fidler, who soon replaced him, as his assistant. Crenshaw established his office in the Donner Laboratory at the University of California. In September 1942, the S-1 Executive Committee recommended that a five-tank pilot plant be built along with a 200-tank section of a production plant.

Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly visits to the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports indicated that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build, and need more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.

The Radiation Laboratory forwarded the preliminary designs for a production plant to Stone &amp; Webster before the end of the year, but one important issue remained unsettled. Oppenheimer contended that weapons-grade uranium would have to be 90% pure uranium-235. Edward Lofgren and Martin Kamen thought that this could not be achieved without a second stage of enrichment. The two stages became known as Alpha and Beta. In March 1943, Groves approved the construction of five Alpha and two Beta racetracks. In September, he authorized four more Alpha racetracks, which became known as Alpha II, along with two more Beta racetracks to process their product.

== Construction ==

Construction of the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, codenamed Y-12, commenced 18 February 1943. The facility would eventually comprise nine major process buildings and 200 other structures covering almost of floor space. The site in Bear Creek Valley southwest of the Oak Ridge township was selected in the hope that the surrounding ridge lines might contain a major explosion or nuclear accident. Problems with the substratum required the excavation crews to perform more blasting and excavation to provide adequate foundations for the heavy machinery in the facilities.

Supplies and materials of all kinds poured in: 2,157 carloads of electrical equipment, 1,219 of heavy equipment, 5,389 of lumber, 1,407 of pipe and fittings, 1,188 of steel, 257 of valves, and 11 of welding electrodes. The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, off-the-shelf components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone &amp; Webster for facility equipment, and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies.

The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District, Colonel James C. Marshall, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols, discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, they realized that silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio of copper:silver. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with the Under Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel W. Bell, and asked for the transfer of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository. Nichols later recalled the conversation: 

Eventually, of silver were used, then worth over $600 million. Nichols had to provide a monthly accounting to the Treasury. The silver bars were taken under guard to the Defense Plant Corporation in Carteret, New Jersey, where they were cast into cylindrical billets, and then to Phelps Dodge in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips thick, wide and long. Some 258 carloads were shipped under guard by rail to Allis-Chalmers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they were wound onto magnetic coils and sealed into welded casings. Finally, they moved by unguarded flatcars to the Clinton Engineer Works. There, special procedures were instituted for handling the silver. When they had to drill holes in it, they did so over paper so that the filings could be collected. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, or less than 0.036% was lost. In May 1970, the last of silver was replaced with copper and returned to the Treasury.

The XAX racetrack with two tanks and three coils was ready to train workers in August 1943. Bugs were discovered, but were not aggressively followed up. The first Alpha process building, 9201-1, was completed on 1 November 1943. When the first racetrack was started up for testing on schedule in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment by as much as because of the power of the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Moisture was also a problem in its own right, as was the winding of the wire, which was too tight. Groves ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned and rewound. Rigid standards for preparation and cleanliness were instituted to prevent a recurrence of these problems.

Training for the Beta tracks shifted from the XAX to the XBX training and development racetrack in November 1943. A second Alpha I racetrack became operational in January 1944. The first Beta racetrack and the third and first Alpha racetracks, now repaired, became operational in March 1944, and the fourth Alpha racetrack in April 1944. A third building, 9201-3, contained a fifth racetrack that incorporated some modifications, and was known as Alpha I. This became operational on 3 June 1944. Work on the Alpha and Beta chemistry buildings, 9202 and 9203, commenced in February 1943, and was completed in September. Work on the Beta process building, 9204-1, began in May 1943, and was ready for operation on 13 March 1944, but was not completed until September 1944.

Groves authorized Alpha II in September 1943. This consisted of two new Alpha process buildings, 9201-4 and 9201-5, another Beta, 9204-2, an extension to the Alpha chemistry building, and a new Beta chemistry building, 9206. When 9206 opened, the old Beta chemistry building, 9203, was converted into a laboratory. Work started on the new Alpha II process buildings on 2 November 1943; the first racetrack was completed in July 1944, and all four were operational by 1 October 1944. The Alpha II racetracks were configured in a linear layout rather than an oval, although they were still called racetracks. In all, there were 864 Alpha calutrons, arranged in nine racetracks of 96. There were only 36 calutrons in each Beta racetrack, for a total of 288 calutrons, although only 216 of them were ever operated.

Work on the new Beta process building commenced on 20 October 1943. Equipment installation began on 1 April 1944, and it was ready for use on 10 September 1944. A third Beta process building, 9204-3, was authorized in May 1944 to process the output of the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. It was completed on 15 May 1945. A fourth Beta process building, 9204-4, was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945. A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the 9207 group was commenced in June 1944, but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed. Along with these main buildings, there were offices, workshops, warehouses and other structures. There were two steam plants for heating, and a power plant for electricity.

== Operations ==

The Alpha racetracks were a 24-fold magnification of the XA calutron that could hold 96 calutron Alpha tanks. The calutrons were upright and arrayed facing each other in pairs of inner and outer machines. To minimize magnetic losses, and to economize on steel consumption, the assembly was curved into an oval shape that formed a closed magnetic loop long, wide and high, in the shape of a racetrack; hence the name. The two Alpha I buildings, 9201-1 and 9201-2, each contained two racetracks, with only one in the Alpha I, 9201-3. The Beta racetracks were smaller, linear in shape, and optimized for recovery rather than production, with only 36 instead of 96 process bins. The four Alpha II racetracks were also linear in configuration. They incorporated many improvements, the most important being that they had four sources instead of just two. They also had improved magnets and vacuum systems.

Tennessee Eastman was hired to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack. Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area. The typical recruit was a young woman, a recent graduate of a local high school. Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee. Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943, where it was conducted on the XA calutron and a 1:16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack, and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available. Some 2,500 operators would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available. The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y-12 ballooned from 10,000 in mid-1944 to 22,482 in August 1945. For security reasons, the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate.
The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate. Then the Tennessee Eastman operators took over. Nichols compared unit production data, and pointed out to Lawrence that the young &quot;hillbilly&quot; girl operators were outproducing his Ph.Ds. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the &quot;Calutron Girls&quot; (called Cubicle Operators at the time) and their supervisors. The women were trained like soldiers not to reason why, while &quot;the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials&quot;.

For a while, the calutrons suffered from a series of debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures, exacerbated by a shortage of spare parts. Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon faded, as they were plagued by insulator failures. These problems were gradually overcome. The first shipments of enriched uranium to the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944, consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent uranium-235. While of no use in a bomb, it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium. The last shipment of Alpha product was made on 11 May 1944. On 7 June 1944, Y-12 made its first delivery of weapons-grade Beta product, enriched to as high as 89% uranium-235.
A major problem was that of loss of feed material and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary efforts were made to recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.

In February 1945, slightly enriched 1.4 percent uranium-235 feed material began arriving from the S-50 liquid thermal diffusion plant. Shipments of product from S-50 were discontinued in April. S-50 product was fed into K-25 instead. In March 1945, Y-12 began receiving feed enriched to 5 percent from K-25. The output of these plants was in the form of uranium hexafluoride (). It was converted to uranium trioxide, which then went into the usual process for conversion to uranium tetrachloride. On 5 August 1945, K-25 started producing feed enriched to 23 percent, enough to be fed straight into the Beta racetracks. The remaining Alpha product was then fed into K-25. By September 1945, the calutrons had produced 88 kilograms of product with an average enrichment of 84.5 percent, and the Beta racetracks turned out another 953 kilograms enriched to 95 percent by the end of the year. Enriched uranium from the calutrons provided the fissile component of the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945.
With the war over, the Alpha tracks began to suspend operations on 4 September 1945, and ceased operation completely on 22 September. The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December 1945, processing feed from K-25 and the new K-27 gaseous diffusion plant. By May 1946, studies suggested that the gaseous diffusion plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass. After a trial demonstrated that this was the case, Groves ordered all but one Beta track shut down in December 1946.

The total cost of the electromagnetic project up to the end of the Manhattan Project on 31 December 1946 was $ (equivalent to $ in ).

== Postwar years ==

The workforce at Y-12 dropped from a wartime peak of 22,482 on 21 August 1945 to less than 1,700 in 1949. All the calutrons were removed and dismantled, except for the XAX and XBX training tracks in Building 9731, and the Beta 3 racetracks in Building 9204–3. In 1947, Eugene Wigner, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), asked the Atomic Energy Commission for permission to use the Beta calutrons to produce isotopes for physics experiments. Permission was granted, and a wide range of isotopes was produced. Lithium-6 from the Beta calutrons was used for research into thermonuclear weapons. Many other isotopes were used for peaceful scientific and medical purposes. The Beta 3 racetracks were transferred to the ORNL in March 1950. By the mid-1950s, the Beta calutrons had produced quantities of all the naturally occurring stable isotopes except those of osmium, which had to wait until April 1960. The calutrons continued to produce isotopes until 1998. , they are still on standby.

== Other countries ==
=== Soviet Union and China ===
Like the United States, the Soviet Union (USSR) carried out research on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project. A trial electromagnetic process was carried out in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany. A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk-45 in 1946. The pilot plant, known as Plant 418, was completed in 1948. A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225° instead of 180° as in the American calutron. It was used to complete the uranium enrichment process after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process. Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium-235 was brought to Sverdlovsk-45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent. After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950, it was decided not to proceed with a full-scale electromagnetic plant. , it remains operational. In 1969, a research calutron known as S-2 was built at Arzamas-16 for high-efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium.

Four research and production calutrons were built at the China Institute of Atomic Energy in Beijing of identical design to those of the USSR in the early 1960s.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1945, the British atomic bomb project built a 180° calutron, similar in design to an American Beta calutron, at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. Owing to the success of the gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst, electromagnetic separation was not pursued by the United Kingdom, and the calutron was used to separate isotopes for research. The 180° design was not ideal for this purpose, so Harwell built a 90° calutron, HERMES, the &quot;Heavy Elements and Radioactive Material Electromagnetic Separator&quot;. It was inspired by France&#x27;s SIDONIE and PARIS separators at the Laboratoire René Bernas of the University of Paris IX in Orsay, and PARSIFAL at the military research laboratory of the Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives in Bruyères-le-Châtel. 

=== Israel, Japan, and France ===
Israel, Japan and France also built some research calutrons, including the SOLIS and MEIRA separators at the Soreq Nuclear Research Center. There is also CERN&#x27;s Isotope Separator On-Line Detector (ISOLDE), which was built in 1967.

=== India ===
A calutron at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics at Bidhan Nagar in India was used to produce plutonium for India&#x27;s first nuclear test on 18 May 1974.

=== Iraq ===
After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM determined that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose to develop the electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq was estimated to be two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.

<doc id="1210997" wikidata="Q1630461" url="?curid=1210997" title="The Take (2004 film)">
<text>The Take is a Canadian documentary film released in 2004 by the wife and husband team of Naomi Klein and Avi Lewis. It tells the story of workers in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who reclaim control of a closed Forja auto plant where they once worked and turn it into a worker cooperative.

==Summary==

The plant closed as a result of the economic policies of the Carlos Menem government under the watchful eye of the International Monetary Fund.

While in bankruptcy protection, the company appeared to be selling off property and inventory to pay creditors – a move which further reduced the chances of the facility returning to production. In an effort to establish their own control, the workers occupied the factory and began a long battle to win the right to operate it themselves, as a cooperative.

This collective movement has gained strength in Argentina, having started with a garment factory several years earlier. The factory workers waded through the courts and legislative system with help from the experience of these other groups who had fought the same battle, and ultimately secured their right to operate the plant.
The film describes the ideological fights beyond co-operative ownership, showing how Menem regained strength as he ran for a subsequent term, despite the poor performance of his privatisation while in office. Ultimately, workers succeed.

==Legacy==
Collaboration between Lewis and Brendan Martin led to the creation of the foundation The Working World/La Bas. It is a non-profit microcredit aimed at cooperatives. It has been registered in the United States as the non-profit &quot;The Working World&quot;, and in June 2008 has obtained the status of an NGO in Argentina as &quot;La Base&quot;.

<doc id="1211001" wikidata="Q7153120" url="?curid=1211001" title="Paul Raymond Publications">
<text>Paul Raymond Publications is a British publisher of softcore monthly pornographic magazine titles, including &quot;Escort&quot;, &quot;Club International&quot;, &quot;Mayfair&quot;, &quot;Men Only&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Razzle&quot;. The company&#x27;s lawyers scrutinise the magazine content before publication to ensure that it is likely to comply with the Obscene Publications Act 1959 since UK law does not allow hardcore R18 imagery to be sold on newsstands. The magazines are generally available in most newsagents, although some larger retailers require them to be sold in bags to protect minors from seeing the cover photographs. The magazines have also been published in digital format since 2013. They were initially available from the dedicated Paul Raymond digital newsstand, but since that closed they have been sold via the publisher&#x27;s main website which contains both softcore and hardcore pornography. Blue Active Media Ltd. is the parent company.

== History ==
Paul Raymond (1925–2008) began his publication ventures, which were financed by Raymond Revuebar profits, with the short-lived &quot;King&quot; magazine in 1964 but the company was established with the purchase of &quot;Men Only&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Club International&quot; in 1972. Raymond relaunched &quot;Men Only&quot; with photographs of the women who worked at his strip-clubs. Within a few years he made the claim of a 500,000 circulation. In 1979 he launched the &quot;Electric Blue&quot; series of videos, a range which was produced until the mid 1990s. 
Raymond&#x27;s daughter Debbie ran the company for a time, until her death in 1992 from an overdose. The company&#x27;s main competitors in the UK are Gold Star Publications, formerly owned by David Sullivan, and Northern &amp; Shell, owned by Richard Desmond. In 1999 the company had revenues of £20 million, and pre-tax profits of £19 million. As of 2001 it produced eight of the 10 best-selling pornographic magazines in the UK, aided by its deal with Comag, one of Britains largest magazine distributors. In the 2000s the company&#x27;s fortunes waned due to competition from the internet and &quot;lad mags&quot;. Profits declined from an annual profit of over £10 million in 2005 to a loss in 2008, a situation that the company blamed on Internet competition and the cost of including free DVDs with its magazines.

==Sale and acquisition==
Following Raymond&#x27;s death, the US arm of the company was sold to Magna Publishing Group; the UK arm was sold to private investors that formed Tri Active Media Ltd. holding it for about 3 years. On 6 October 2012 Paul Chaplin bought Paul Raymond Publications for an undisclosed sum and united it with &quot;Loaded&quot; and &quot;Superbike&quot; magazines under the newly formed Blue Active Media Ltd. This provided the capital to rejuvenate the Paul Raymond magazines with the aim of returning them to their heyday. &quot;Mayfair&quot; magazine improved in paper quality and pagination.

Chaplin aimed to use digital media to add value to the print publications. He developed the Paul Raymond brand online, setting up new websites using the top-level domain name .xxx that had been introduced in 2011.

<text>BBC Radio Scotland is a Scottish national radio network owned and operated by BBC Scotland, a division of the BBC. It broadcasts a wide variety of programmes. It replaced the Scottish BBC Radio 4 opt-out service of the same name from 23 November 1978.

Radio Scotland is broadcast in English, whilst sister station Radio nan Gàidheal broadcasts in Scottish Gaelic.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 801,000 and has a listening share of 5.8% as of March 2024.

==History==

The first BBC Radio Scotland broadcast was on 17 December 1973, a fortnight earlier than planned.

BBC Radio Scotland was founded as a full-time radio network on 23 November 1978. Previously it was possible only to opt out of BBC Radio 4, and the service was known as Radio 4 Scotland or, formally on air, as &quot;BBC Scotland Radio 4&quot;. Although on some occasions Radio Scotland used to use BBC Radio 2 as a sustaining service at certain times, most notably during the &quot;Sport on 2&quot; Saturday afternoon programme with a BBC Scotland opt-out on 202m known as &quot;BBC Scotland Radio 2&quot;; however, this has been discontinued since.

The establishment of a separate network was made possible when Radio 4 became a fully UK-wide network when it moved from medium wave to long wave and new VHF (FM) transmitters were brought into service, so that Radio 4 and Radio Scotland no longer had to share on FM. However, it was not until the early 1990s that Radio 4 was available on FM across all of Scotland; so for its first decade on air, the station only broadcast during the day so that Radio 4 could be heard on Radio Scotland&#x27;s transmitters in the evening to compensate for poorer AM reception after dark.

Kirsty Wark launched her career on BBC Radio Scotland, first as a researcher and then as a producer.

==Programmes==
Radio Scotland broadcasts a wide range of programming, including news, debate, music, drama, comedy and sports. It is broadcast from the BBC Scotland headquarters in the Pacific Quay in Glasgow. The station simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live during its overnight downtime.

==Local opt-outs==
BBC Radio Orkney and BBC Radio Shetland opt out of BBC Radio Scotland for 30 minutes each weekday to broadcast a local news programme and during the winter months this is supplemented in both areas by an additional hour-long programme. Local news and weather bulletins are also broadcast as opt-outs from news studios in Selkirk, Dumfries, Aberdeen and Inverness on weekdays.

<text>BBC Radio Wales is a Welsh national radio station owned and operated by BBC Cymru Wales, a division of the BBC. It began broadcasting on 13 November 1978, replacing the Welsh opt-out service of BBC Radio 4. 

As of August 2022, the station&#x27;s managing editor is Carolyn Hitt, who is also editor of BBC Wales Sport.

Radio Wales is broadcast in English, whilst sister network Radio Cymru broadcasts in Welsh. According to RAJAR, BBC Radio Wales has a weekly audience of 348,000 listeners and a listening share of 5.5%, as of March 2024.

==History==
In November 1978, BBC Radio Wales launched on the former Radio 4 opt-out frequency of 882 kHz. Initially the station broadcast for only twenty hours per week, and relayed output from Radio 2 and Radio 4 at other times. However, the groundwork had been laid for the station to gradually become a full-time service and now Radio Wales broadcasts for up to twenty hours a day.

BBC Radio Wales was preceded in the autumn of 1978 by four experimental local radio stations broadcasting for a single week: Radio Wrexham, Radio Deeside, Radio Merthyr and Radio Rhondda. They were broadcast using an RTÉ Outside Broadcast transmitter. The first editor of BBC Radio Wales was Teleri Bevan, a former producer for Radio 4 Wales.

Radio Wales commenced broadcasting at 6.30am on Monday 13 November 1978 with the first edition of &quot;AM&quot;, a breakfast magazine show presented by Anita Morgan, which replaced the news-driven predecessor &quot;Good Morning Wales&quot;. Chris Stuart later took over &quot;AM&quot;, presenting the programme for almost a decade, before it was replaced by a revival of &quot;Good Morning Wales&quot;, which was again axed in May 2019. The other main presenters for the first decade on air included Mike Flynn, who hosted a show each weekday until 1989, Vincent Kane, Noreen Bray and Alun Williams.

By 1985, Roy Noble was also a regular daily voice, presenting weekday magazine shows for the station for 27 years. Old Radio 4 type continuity studios were modified to become &quot;self-operated&quot; by the early 1980s. Outside broadcasts from different towns in Wales were also introduced, with Mike Flynn and Alun Williams hosting a weekly three-hour live show on Friday mornings.
BBC Radio Wales also began to use publicity similar to the type used by commercial radio stations in the UK. Other early presenters included Wyn Calvin, Maureen Staffer, Sylvia Horn, G. V. Wynne Jones (Geevers), Claire Vincent, Piet Brinton, Jackie Emlyn and Princess Anne&#x27;s biographer Brian Hoey.

=== Radio Gwent and Radio Clwyd opt-outs ===
Following BBC Wales&#x27; experiments with community radio in 1978, two permanent opt-out services were developed in the north-east and the south-east. Radio Deeside was relaunched in February 1980 in response to the closure of the Shotton steelworks.

Its coverage area was expanded to the rest of Clwyd in October 1981 and the station was subsequently renamed BBC Radio Clwyd, broadcasting on 657 kHz, and featuring extended local news bulletins, a mid-morning show and occasional special programming from studios in Mold until its closure in October 1993. After the closure of Radio Clwyd, local bulletins for north-east Wales continued until March 2002 - staff having moved from Mold to Wrexham in June 1998.

BBC Radio Gwent, based in Cwmbran, broadcast from 18 April 1983 until March 1991. Radio Gwent was available on FM, and since its closure has continued to relay the national Radio Wales service on the same FM frequencies to the Gwent area. Both of these stations operated at peak times only and carried Radio Wales at other times.

==Programming==
BBC Radio Wales broadcasts each weekday from 05:30 to 00:30 and from 05:00 to 01:00 at weekends, live from the headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales at Central Square, near the main railway station in Cardiff city centre. During the station&#x27;s downtime, Radio Wales simulcasts the output of BBC Radio 5 Live.

Weekday programming includes the flagship breakfast news magazine &quot;Radio Wales Breakfast&quot; with Claire Summers (Monday–Thursday), magazine shows with Jason Mohammad (Monday–Wednesday), Wynne Evans, Behnaz Akhgar (Monday–Thursday) and Eleri Siôn (Friday).

Weekend programming includes Sunday afternoon shows with Lynn Bowles and Roy Noble, Adam Walton&#x27;s new music show on Saturday nights, &quot;Celtic Heartbeat&quot; with Frank Hennessy, &quot;Beverley’s World of Music&quot; hosted by Beverley Humphreys and entertainment shows with Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Bronwen Lewis.

Most of Radio Wales&#x27; programming is produced and broadcast from the Cardiff headquarters with the Adam Walton show originating from the BBC&#x27;s Wrexham studios on the Glyndŵr University campus.

===Sports coverage===

&quot;Radio Wales Sport&quot; is broadcast on Saturdays, generally between 14:00 and 19:00, during the football and rugby seasons (the programme is extended on occasions to include live commentary of early and late matches).

&quot;Radio Wales Sport&quot; features localised FM commentary of Swansea City in the south-west of Wales, Cardiff City in the south-east of Wales, and Wrexham in north Wales with a rolling service of match updates and results on medium wave. The station&#x27;s commentators are led by BBC Wales football correspondent Rob Phillips and BBC Wales rugby correspondent Gareth Charles. The summarisers include former Wales football captain Kevin Ratcliffe and former Wales flanker Martyn Williams.

==Transmission==
BBC Radio Wales is broadcast across Wales on FM, DAB and 882kHz medium wave. It is also available on Freeview in Wales and throughout the UK on Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media and the BBC Sounds service.

As Radio Wales was created from an opt-out of BBC Radio 4, it inherited the medium wave transmitters previously used by Radio 4 across Wales — the main service coming from the Washford transmitter in Somerset on . This transmitter was originally built to cover southern Wales and most of the West Country, and has a far greater coverage than its intended transmission area. It can be heard across the Bristol area, in much of Devon and northern Cornwall, as well as in eastern and south-eastern counties of Ireland.

Initially, Radio Wales was not broadcast on FM as Radio 4&#x27;s former FM transmitters in Wales were used for BBC Radio Cymru. In 1983, Radio Wales gained some FM coverage with the creation of opt-out service, BBC Radio Gwent. After the breakfast programme, Radio Gwent simulcast most of Radio Wales&#x27; output. When the station closed in 1991, the FM frequencies were retained to broadcast Radio Wales.

From 1999 onwards, the BBC was able to start creating an FM network for Radio Wales, including a 120 kW ERP transmitter near Aberystwyth. On 6 December 2011, Radio Wales added the 40 kW ERP Wenvoe transmitter to its network on FM, replacing a low-power FM transmitter on the Wenallt Hill. This FM output covers South Wales and the West of England, including the city of Bristol.

On 24 October 2018, the station increased its FM coverage in North East and Mid Wales by taking over 32 transmitters previously used by BBC Radio 3. The changeover allowed an estimated 400,000 listeners to receive Radio Wales on FM, extending its reach to a potential 91% of households in Wales.

Regional opt-outs have been established for sports coverage on FM; specifically live football commentaries involving Cardiff City in the south-east, Swansea City in the south-west and Wrexham in the north.

BBC Radio Wales&#x27;s medium wave broadcasts on 1125 kHz were discontinued on 2 April 2020, with 657 kHz and most transmitters operating on 882 kHz following suit on 8 June 2021. The Washford transmitter on 882 kHz is the final BBC Radio Wales medium wave transmitter on air ever since.

== Race discrimination case ==

In 2001, presenter Lionel Kelleway won a case for racial discrimination against BBC Radio Wales, when they dropped his &quot;Landmark &quot;series, which won Sony Awards in 1991 and 1992, after around ten years, because of his English accent.

<doc id="1211024" wikidata="Q300344" url="?curid=1211024" title="A Broken Frame">
<text>A Broken Frame is the second studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 27 September 1982 by Mute Records. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and was recorded as a trio after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left and formed Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second band tour in the United Kingdom prior to the release of &quot;A Broken Frame&quot;, but had not officially joined yet and does not appear on the album.

The album reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart and was promoted by the singles &quot;See You&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Love&quot; and &quot;Leave in Silence&quot;.

==Background==
The album is a transition from the lighter and optimistic sound of &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; and the more heavy and darker sound that formed on their later albums. Daniel Miller recalled that the process of production was quite different from the previous album, stating, &quot;It was almost like a blank sheet of paper, the songs were recorded in a different way because Vince had a very specific idea of what the song was going to end up sounding like, and Martin didn&#x27;t really have that. It was more like, &#x27;Here&#x27;s the words, here&#x27;s the melody. Let&#x27;s figure it out.&#x27;&quot;

However, Miller also believed that &quot;some of the more experimental elements of the band came out in &quot;A Broken Frame&quot;, which I enjoyed. They were making pop records, but they, especially Martin, were into experimental music and that started to feed into tracks like &#x27;Monument&#x27;.&quot;

He also said that the instrumental track &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot; gained its title from Martin, who was &quot;reading some weird book during the making of the record, a book of prophecies or something and he looked up his birthdate and it said, &#x27;Nothing to fear.&#x27; So that actually ended up being a track title, and it made him very optimistic about the future.&quot; Miller also believes that the album &quot;was a transitional record and while it&#x27;s not their best record, it&#x27;s hugely important in terms of how it was made and how it gave everybody confidence. It&#x27;s when people really started believing in the future of the band.&quot;

==Critical reception and legacy==

&quot;Smash Hits&quot; wrote that &quot;A Broken Frame&quot;, in contrast to the group&#x27;s early post-Clarke singles showed &quot;a lack of purpose&quot;, &quot;makes a virtue of their tinkly-bonk whimsy&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that, although &quot;ambitious and bold&quot;, &quot;&quot;A Broken Frame&quot; – as its name suggests – marks the end of a beautiful dream&quot;, a comment on the departure of main songwriter Clarke. Reviewer Steve Sutherland considered the songs &quot;daft aspirations to art&quot;, the album&#x27;s musical and thematic &quot;larcenies&quot; sounding like &quot;puerile infatuations papering over anonymity&quot;. At the same time, Sutherland acknowledged that the group&#x27;s increasing complexity &quot;sounds less the result of exterior persuasion than an understandable, natural development&quot;, although he finally concluded that Depeche Mode remain (in contrast to Clarke&#x27;s new group Yazoo) &quot;essentially vacuous&quot;.

The comments of &quot;Noise!&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;DH&quot; (most likely &quot;Noise!&quot; contributor Dave Henderson) were more favourable. &quot;DH&quot; said that the album &quot;falls together well and shows we can expect a lot more from the clean cut quartet&quot;, adding &quot;[a]t times it reaches high points far exceeding their first album.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett described &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; as &quot;a notably more ambitious effort than the pure pop/disco of the band&#x27;s debut&quot;, with much of the album &quot;forsaking earlier sprightliness... for more melancholy reflections about love gone wrong&quot;. He added: &quot;More complex arrangements and juxtaposed sounds, such as the sparkle of breaking glass in &#x27;Leave in Silence&#x27;, help give this underrated album even more of an intriguing, unexpected edge.&quot;

In 1990, while promoting their album &quot;Violator&quot;, songwriter Martin Gore lamented parts of the album, saying, &quot;I regret all that sickly boy-next-door stuff of the early days... musically &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; was a mish-mash&quot;.

==Cover image==
Despite being a photograph, the cover artwork is intended to resemble a painting. It depicts a woman cutting grain in an East Anglian field, near Duxford, Cambridgeshire. It was taken by Brian Griffin (who had previously taken the cover photograph for &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; and press photos for the band) using a mixture of natural and artificial lighting. Griffin cited as inspirations the socialist realism of Soviet Russia, especially the work of Kazimir Malevich, and German Romanticism. Griffin has displayed on his website a gallery of alternative images from the same shoot. Later releases of the album on vinyl (2007) and compact disc (2009) feature slightly different takes of the shot. It was also featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot;″s 1990 edition of &quot;World&#x27;s Best Photographs 1980–1990&quot;.

==Tour==
The tour began in October 1982 in Chippenham, England. The jaunt eventually reached 12 countries, which included the group&#x27;s first shows in Asia, before wrapping up with a one-off festival appearance in Schüttorf, West Germany, in May 1983. A tour in support of the act&#x27;s subsequent studio release, &quot;Construction Time Again&quot;, followed in September.

Selected tracks from the 25 October 1982 show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London have been published on the &quot;Get the Balance Right!&quot;, &quot;Everything Counts&quot; and &quot;Love, in Itself&quot; limited-edition 12-inch singles, as well as CD reissues.

==Track listing==

* Some original US CD copies of the album tacked the intro of &quot;The Sun &amp; the Rainfall&quot; onto the end of &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Have Done That&quot;, making the duration of &quot;The Sun &amp; the Rainfall&quot; 4:54.
* Dave Gahan sings lead vocals on all songs except &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Have Done That&quot; which is a duet with Gore. &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot; and &quot;Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden&quot; are instrumental.

===2006 Collectors Edition (CD + DVD)===
* Disc one is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer. The track listing is identical to the 1982 UK release, except &quot;Satellite&quot; which is 4:43 long and contains a slight edit, or error, at the beginning of the track.
* Disc two is a DVD which includes &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo plus bonus material.

==Marsheaux cover version==
In 2015, Greek synth-pop duo Marsheaux released a complete cover version of &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; on Undo Records. &quot;Release Magazine&quot; wrote that this version was not &quot;anything essential&quot; but well done. &quot;The Electricity Club&quot; found influences of And One in the cover of &quot;The Sun &amp; the Rainfall&quot; and concluded that Marsheaux had &quot;used unconventional sounds and vocals to make this record their own&quot;. Reviews from Germany noted that Marsheaux had elaborated on the assets and downsides of the original release. According to &quot;Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, the kitschy sides of the early Depeche Mode album were deliberately uncovered in tracks like &quot;The Meaning of Love&quot;, while the &quot;Sonic Seducer&quot; lauded Marsheaux&#x27;s darker and slower interpretation of this song.

<doc id="1211026" wikidata="Q9066006" url="?curid=1211026" title="Rainbow/PUSH">
<text>Rainbow/PUSH is a Chicago-based nonprofit organization formed as a merger of two nonprofit organizations founded by Jesse Jackson; Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity) and the National Rainbow Coalition. The organizations pursue social justice, civil rights, and political activism.

In December 1971, Jackson resigned from Operation Breadbasket after clashing with Ralph Abernathy and founded Operation PUSH. In 1984, Jackson founded the National Rainbow Coalition. It merged with PUSH in 1996. The combined organization&#x27;s national headquarters is on the South Side of Chicago and it has regional branches in Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Atlanta, Silicon Valley, New Orleans, and Boston.

Operation PUSH raised public awareness to initiate corporate action and government sponsorship. The National Rainbow Coalition became a prominent political organization that raised public awareness of numerous political issues and consolidated a large voting bloc. The merged entity has undertaken numerous social initiatives.

== PUSH ==

Operation PUSH, an acronym for People United to Save (later Serve) Humanity, was an organization that advocated black self-help and achieved a broad audience for its liberal stances on social justice and civil rights.

Operation PUSH&#x27;s origins can be traced to a factional split in Operation Breadbasket, an affiliate of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr., the head of the SCLC, appointed Jackson to head the Chicago chapter of Operation Breadbasket, which became a coalition of black ministers and entrepreneurs.

After 1968, Jackson increasingly clashed with King&#x27;s successor at SCLC, Ralph Abernathy. The break became complete in December 1971 when Abernathy suspended Jackson for &quot;administrative improprieties and repeated acts of violation of organizational policy.&quot; Jackson resigned from Operation Breadbasket, called together his allies, and formed Operation PUSH.

From its inception, Jackson called its membership a &quot;Rainbow Coalition.&quot; This concept and phrase was originally created by the 1968 Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton. Hampton used it to describe the multiethnic revolutionary federation he founded. Jackson was not part of Hampton&#x27;s Rainbow Coalition, and had a difficult relationship with the Panthers. Some former members of Hampton&#x27;s coalition resent Jackson for using the name, partly because Jackson&#x27;s politics are reformist, and partly because Jackson copyrighted the name, preventing others from using it.

Although money was a problem at first, initial backing came from Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, Gary, Indiana Mayor Richard Hatcher, Aretha Franklin, Jim Brown, and Ossie Davis.
The organizational meeting of PUSH was in the Chicago home of T.R.M. Howard, a prominent black doctor and community leader on the South Side. Before he moved to Chicago in 1956, Howard developed a national reputation as a Mississippi civil rights leader, surgeon, and entrepreneur. He served on PUSH&#x27;s board of directors and chaired the finance committee.

Through PUSH Jackson was able to continue pursuing the same economic objectives that Operation Breadbasket had. In addition, his organization expanded into social and political development for blacks in Chicago and nationwide. The 1970s saw various tactics to pursue the organization&#x27;s objectives including direct action campaigns, weekly radio broadcasts, and awards, through which Jackson protected black homeowners, workers, and businesses, and honored prominent blacks in the US and abroad.

Jackson also started a campaign against legalizing abortion after &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was decided in 1973. PUSH was concerned with minority youth reading, and championed education through PUSH-Excel, a spin-off program that emphasized keeping inner-city youths in school while assisting them with job placement. The program, which persuaded inner-city youth to pledge in writing to study two hours per night and involved parental monitoring, impressed Jimmy Carter, whose administration became a large sponsor after Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano and Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall courted Jackson.
The organization was very successful at committing major corporations with large presences in the black community to adopt affirmative action programs in which they hired more black executives and supervisors and to buy from black suppliers, wholesalers, and distributors. The organization employed prayer vigils to call attention to issues. It opposed Ronald Reagan&#x27;s workfare initiative requiring that welfare recipients work for part of their benefits.

The organization staged several boycotts, including early 1980s boycotts of Anheuser Busch and Coca-Cola as well as a 1986 boycott of CBS television affiliates. The boycotts became so well known that at one point David Duke supporters referred to a boycott of Nike, Inc. as oppression of whites by blacks. Nike spokesperson Michael Jordan disavowed the boycott. The boycotts of Budweiser and Coke as well as one against Kentucky Fried Chicken were touted for having won minority job concessions from white businesses.

== National Rainbow Coalition ==

The National Rainbow Coalition (Rainbow Coalition for short) was a political organization that grew out of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign. During the campaign, Jackson began speaking about a &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot;, an idea created by Fred Hampton, regarding the disadvantaged and welcomed voters from a broad spectrum of races and creeds. The goals of the campaign were to demand social programs, voting rights, and affirmative action for all groups that had been neglected by Reaganomics.

Jackson&#x27;s campaign blamed President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s policies for reduction of government domestic spending, causing new unemployment and encouraging economic investment outside of the inner cities, while they discouraged the rebuilding of urban industry. The industrial layoffs caused by these policies hit the Black and other minority populations particularly hard.

At the 1984 Democratic National Convention on July 18, 1984, in San Francisco, California, Jackson delivered an address entitled &quot;The Rainbow Coalition&quot;. The speech called for Arab Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, youth, disabled veterans, small farmers, lesbians and gays to join with African Americans and Jewish Americans for political purpose. Whereas the purpose of PUSH had been to fight for economic and educational opportunities, the Rainbow Coalition was created to address political empowerment and public policy issues.

After his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 1984, Jackson attempted to build a broad base of support among groups that &quot;were hurt by Reagan administration policies&quot; - racial minorities, the poor, small farmers, working mothers, the unemployed, some labor union members, gays, and lesbians.

== 1990s onwards ==
Jackson moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. to serve as shadow senator from 1991 to 1996. When he returned to Chicago in 1996 he merged his organizations. The merged entity advocates for African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, other minorities, and women. Its main economic goal is to have more minorities on the payrolls, in the boardrooms, and on the supplier lists of major corporations. The industries it most aggressively pursues are the financial sector on Wall Street, the telecommunications field and high-tech firms in Silicon Valley.

The Wall Street activities are organized under sub-organization &quot;The Wall Street Project&quot;. The organization has been active in pursuit of increase minority representation in other industries, most notably the broadcast media, the entertainment industry, and the automobile industry. It has also sought increased representation by minority administrators in college and professional sports under the leadership of Jesse Jackson, Jr. For Hispanic issues the merged entity works closely with the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Council of La Raza.

In 1998 the organization attacked Freddie Mac for its lending and employment practices, which led to its pledge to earmark $1 billion in mortgage loans specifically for minorities, to donate more than $1 million directly to Rainbow/PUSH and to become a sponsor of Jackson&#x27;s annual Wall Street Project. In 2000, the organization investigated the case of Raynard Johnson, who was found hanged by a belt from a tree in front of his home in Kokomo, Mississippi. Jackson labelled it a &quot;lynching&quot;, although two autopsies both concluded that the death was a suicide.

In the early 2000s (decade), Rainbow/PUSH worked with NASCAR to increase the number of minorities involved in auto racing, through direct financial support and projects to find talented African-American racing drivers. This initiative was ended in 2003, after the racing sanctioning body was criticized by conservative groups for the partnership. Among the smaller campaigns it has undertaken are the HIV/AIDS Initiative for funding for AIDS programs; the National Field Department support of &quot;constructive agitation to bring about societal change&quot;; and the Prison Outpost project, whose ultimate goal is &quot;to eliminate the need for prisons.&quot;

Through his organization and its predecessors Jackson has advocated universal health care, a war on drugs, direct peace negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, ending apartheid in South Africa and advancing democracy in Haiti. The following is the organization&#x27;s list of major issues:

* 1% Student Loans
* Jobs and Economic Empowerment
* Employee Rights and Livable Wages
* Educational Access
* Fair and Decent Housing
* Voter Registration and Civic Education
* Election Law Reform
* Fairness in the Media, Sports, and Criminal Justice System
* Political Empowerment
* Trade and Foreign Policy
* Affirmative Action and Equal Rights
* Gender Equality
* Environmental Justice

Former congressman Mel Reynolds, who served a sentence in prison for sexual assault and bank fraud, was hired by Rainbow/PUSH as its resident scholar on prison reform after his release in 2001. The organization is a member of several anti-war coalitions including Win Without War, United for Peace and Justice, and After Downing Street.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, Rev. Jesse Jackson promised to raise money and collect donations for those affected. The organization set up drop-off locations in Chicago to assist with relief efforts.

On July 16, 2023, Jackson, who was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2017 and was now using a wheelchair, stepped down as head of Rainbow/PUSH after leading the organization for more than five decades. He was succeeded by Dallas minister Frederick Douglass Haynes III. In April 2024, Haynes resigned from Rainbow/PUSH after leading the organization for less than a year.

== Involvement in the Duke Lacrosse team controversy ==
In 2006, Jesse Jackson promised the Rainbow/Push Coalition would pay Crystal Mangum&#x27;s college tuition. Mangum made false rape allegations against members of Duke University&#x27;s men&#x27;s lacrosse team who had hired her as a stripper. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. Jackson said that whatever the outcome of the trial, the tuition offer would still be good.

<doc id="1211053" wikidata="Q1158767" url="?curid=1211053" title="Void coefficient">
<text>In nuclear engineering, the void coefficient (more properly called void coefficient of reactivity) is a number that can be used to estimate how much the reactivity of a nuclear reactor changes as voids (typically steam bubbles) form in the reactor moderator or coolant. Net reactivity in a reactor depends on several factors, one of which is the void coefficient. Reactors in which either the moderator or the coolant is a liquid will typically have a void coefficient which is either negative (if the reactor is under-moderated) or positive (if the reactor is over-moderated). Reactors in which neither the moderator nor the coolant is a liquid (e.g., a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled reactor) will have a zero void coefficient. It is unclear how the definition of &quot;void&quot; coefficient applies to reactors in which the moderator/coolant is neither liquid nor gas (supercritical water reactor).

== Explanation ==
Nuclear fission reactors run on nuclear chain reactions, in which each nucleus that undergoes fission releases heat and neutrons. Each neutron may impact another nucleus and cause it to undergo fission. The speed of this neutron affects its probability of causing additional fission, as does the presence of neutron-absorbing material. On the one hand, thermal neutrons are more easily absorbed by fissile nuclei than fast neutrons, so a neutron moderator that slows neutrons will increase the reactivity of a nuclear reactor. On the other hand, a neutron absorber will decrease the reactivity of a nuclear reactor. These two mechanisms are used to control the thermal power output of a nuclear reactor.

In order to extract useful power from a nuclear reactor, and (for most reactor designs) to keep it intact and functioning, a cooling system must be used. Some reactors circulate pressurized water; some use liquid metal, such as sodium, NaK, lead, or mercury; others use gases (see advanced gas-cooled reactor). If the coolant is a liquid, it may boil if the temperature inside the reactor rises. This boiling leads to &quot;voids&quot; inside the reactor. Voids may also form if coolant is lost from the reactor in some sort of accident (called a loss of coolant accident, which has other dangers). Some reactors operate with the coolant in a constant state of boiling, using the generated vapor to turn turbines.

The coolant liquid may act as a neutron absorber, as a neutron moderator, usually as both but with one or other role as the most influential. In either case, the amount of void inside the reactor can affect the reactivity of the reactor. The change in reactivity caused by a change of voids inside the reactor is directly proportional to the &quot;void coefficient&quot;. 

A positive void coefficient means that the reactivity increases as the void content inside the reactor increases due to increased boiling or loss of coolant; for example, if the coolant acts predominantly as neutron absorber. This positive void coefficient causes a positive feedback loop, starting with the first occurrence of steam bubbles. This can quickly boil all the coolant in the reactor, if not countered by an (automatic) control mechanism, or if said mechanism&#x27;s response time is too slow. This happened in the RBMK reactor that was destroyed in the Chernobyl disaster due to positive void coefficient and fast power coefficients present at lower reactor power levels, the EPS scram accelerating rather than dampening reactivity resulting in the explosion.

A negative void coefficient means that the reactivity decreases as the void content inside the reactor increases—but it also means that the reactivity increases if the void content inside the reactor is reduced. In boiling-water reactors with large negative void coefficients, a sudden pressure rise (caused, for example, by unplanned closure of a streamline valve) will result in a sudden decrease in void content: the increased pressure will cause some of the steam bubbles to condense (&quot;collapse&quot;); and the thermal output will possibly increase until it is terminated by safety systems, by increased void formation due to the higher power, or, possibly, by system or component failures that relieve pressure, causing void content to increase and power to decrease. Boiling water reactors are all designed (and required) to handle this type of transient. On the other hand, if a reactor is designed to operate with no voids at all, a large negative void coefficient may serve as a safety system. A loss of coolant in such a reactor decreases the thermal output, but of course heat that is generated is no longer removed, so the temperature could rise (if all other safety systems simultaneously failed).

Thus, a large void coefficient, whether positive or negative, can be either a design issue (requiring more careful, faster-acting control systems) or a desired quality depending on reactor design. Gas-cooled reactors do not have issues with voids forming.

== Reactor designs ==
* Boiling water reactors generally have negative void coefficients, and in normal operation the negative void coefficient allows reactor power to be adjusted by changing the rate of water flow through the core. The negative void coefficient can cause an unplanned reactor power increase in events (such as sudden closure of a streamline valve) where the reactor pressure is suddenly increased. In addition, the negative void coefficient can result in power oscillations in the event of a sudden reduction in core flow, such as might be caused by a recirculation pump failure. Boiling water reactors are designed to ensure that the rate of pressure rise from a sudden streamline valve closure is limited to acceptable values, and they include multiple safety systems designed to ensure that any sudden reactor power increases or unstable power oscillations are terminated before fuel or piping damage can occur.
* Pressurized water reactors operate with a relatively small amount of voids, and the water serves as both moderator and coolant. Thus a large negative void coefficient ensures that if the water boils or is lost the power output will drop. 
* CANDU reactors have positive void coefficients that are small enough that the control systems can easily respond to boiling coolant before the reactor reaches dangerous temperatures (see References). Furthermore, a loss of coolant accident automatically scrams the reactor and unlike in light water reactors, the introduction of &quot;regular&quot; water to the reactor core—for example as an emergency coolant—does not pose the risk of criticality as a CANDU can only reach criticality in the absence of the neutron absorption that is present in significant quantities of light water.
* RBMK reactors, such as the reactors at Chernobyl, had a dangerously high positive void coefficient. This allowed the reactor to run on unenriched uranium and to require no heavy water, saving costs; RBMKs were also capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, unlike the other main Soviet design, the VVER. Before the Chernobyl accident these reactors had a positive void coefficient of 4.7 beta, which after the accident was lowered to 0.7 beta so they could safely remain in service. 
* Fast breeder reactors do not use moderators, since they run on fast neutrons, but the coolant (often lead or sodium) may serve as a neutron absorber and reflector. For this reason they have a positive void coefficient. 
* Magnox reactors, advanced gas-cooled reactors and pebble bed reactors are gas-cooled and so void coefficients are not an issue. In fact, some can be designed so that total loss of coolant does not cause core meltdown even in the absence of active control systems. As with any reactor design, loss of coolant is only one of many possible failures that could potentially lead to an accident. In case of accidental ingress of liquid water into the core of pebble bed reactors, a positive void coefficient may occur. Magnox and UNGG reactors were designed with the dual purpose of producing electrical power and weapon grade plutonium.
* The Advanced CANDU reactor, a never built proposed reactor type based on the CANDU, promises a negative void coefficient but it must use slightly enriched uranium as a fuel and cannot operate with natural uranium as the &quot;regular&quot; CANDU does.
* In a molten salt reactor the salt is usually neither a strong moderator nor a neutron poison. If a thermal neutron spectrum is used, external moderators such as nuclear graphite are usually employed. Volatile fission products can &quot;bubble out&quot; of solution and as the fuel is dissolved in the salt, this decreases reactivity at and around the site of the bubble. Furthermore, most of the fission product noble gases—chief among them Xenon-135 are strong neutron poisons. As the boiling point of the involved salts is relatively high (at a point at which the structural integrity of the housing for the molten salt would be in question), there is usually little to no emphasis put on the consequences of it boiling off. Frequently molten salt reactors employ a melt plug that melts at much lower temperatures than the boiling point of the salts and allows them to solidify in a core catcher.

<text>In mathematics, an abstract polytope is an algebraic partially ordered set which captures the dyadic property of a traditional polytope without specifying purely geometric properties such as points and lines.

A geometric polytope is said to be a &quot;realization&quot; of an abstract polytope in some real N-dimensional space, typically Euclidean. This abstract definition allows more general combinatorial structures than traditional definitions of a polytope, thus allowing new objects that have no counterpart in traditional theory.

== Introductory concepts ==

=== Traditional versus abstract polytopes ===
In Euclidean geometry, two shapes that are not similar can nonetheless share a common structure. For example, a square and a trapezoid both comprise an alternating chain of four vertices and four sides, which makes them quadrilaterals. They are said to be isomorphic or “structure preserving”.

This common structure may be represented in an underlying abstract polytope, a purely algebraic partially ordered set which captures the pattern of connections (or &quot;incidences)&quot; between the various structural elements. The measurable properties of traditional polytopes such as angles, edge-lengths, skewness, straightness and convexity have no meaning for an abstract polytope.

What is true for traditional polytopes (also called classical or geometric polytopes) may not be so for abstract ones, and vice versa. For example, a traditional polytope is regular if all its facets and vertex figures are regular, but this is not necessarily so for an abstract polytope.

====Realizations====
A traditional polytope is said to be a &quot;realization&quot; of the associated abstract polytope. A realization is a mapping or injection of the abstract object into a real space, typically Euclidean, to construct a traditional polytope as a real geometric figure.

The six quadrilaterals shown are all distinct realizations of the abstract quadrilateral, each with different geometric properties. Some of them do not conform to traditional definitions of a quadrilateral and are said to be &quot;unfaithful&quot; realizations. A conventional polytope is a faithful realization.

===Faces, ranks and ordering===
In an abstract polytope, each structural element (vertex, edge, cell, etc.) is associated with a corresponding member of the set. The term &quot;face&quot; is used to refer to any such element e.g. a vertex (0-face), edge (1-face) or a general &quot;k&quot;-face, and not just a polygonal 2-face.

The faces are &quot;ranked&quot; according to their associated real dimension: vertices have rank 0, edges rank 1 and so on.

Incident faces of different ranks, for example, a vertex F of an edge G, are ordered by the relation F &lt; G. F is said to be a &quot;subface&quot; of G.

F, G are said to be &quot;incident&quot; if either F = G or F &lt; G or G &lt; F. This usage of &quot;incidence&quot; also occurs in finite geometry, although it differs from traditional geometry and some other areas of mathematics. For example, in the square &quot;ABCD&quot;, edges &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; are not abstractly incident (although they are both incident with vertex B).

A polytope is then defined as a set of faces P with an order relation &lt;. Formally, P (with &lt;) will be a (strict) partially ordered set, or &quot;poset&quot;.

===Least and greatest faces===
Just as the number zero is necessary in mathematics, so also every set has the empty set ∅ as a subset. In an abstract polytope ∅ is by convention identified as the &quot;least&quot; or &quot;null&quot; face and is a subface of all the others. Since the least face is one level below the vertices or 0-faces, its rank is −1 and it may be denoted as &quot;F&quot;−1. Thus F−1 ≡ ∅ and the abstract polytope also contains the empty set as an element. It is usually not realized, though the lack of its realization could be interpreted as it being realized as the set containing no points, the empty set.

There is also a single face of which all the others are subfaces. This is called the &quot;greatest&quot; face. In an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polytope, the greatest face has rank = &quot;n&quot; and may be denoted as &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;. It is sometimes realized as the interior of the geometric figure.

These least and greatest faces are sometimes called &quot;improper&quot; faces, with all others being &quot;proper&quot; faces.

===A simple example===
The faces of the abstract quadrilateral or square are shown in the table below:

The relation &lt; comprises a set of pairs, which here include

: &quot;F&quot;−1&lt;a, ... , &quot;F&quot;−1&lt;X, ... , &quot;F&quot;−1&lt;G, ... , b&lt;Y, ... , c&lt;G, ... , Z&lt;G.

Order relations are transitive, i.e. F &lt; G and G &lt; H implies that F &lt; H. Therefore, to specify the hierarchy of faces, it is not necessary to give every case of F &lt; H, only the pairs where one is the successor of the other, i.e. where F &lt; H and no G satisfies F &lt; G &lt; H.

The edges W, X, Y and Z are sometimes written as ab, ad, bc, and cd respectively, but such notation is not always appropriate.

All four edges are structurally similar and the same is true of the vertices. The figure therefore has the symmetries of a square and is usually referred to as the square.

===The Hasse diagram===

Smaller posets, and polytopes in particular, are often best visualized in a Hasse diagram, as shown. By convention, faces of equal rank are placed on the same vertical level. Each &quot;line&quot; between faces, say F, G, indicates an ordering relation &lt; such that F &lt; G where F is below G in the diagram.

The Hasse diagram defines the unique poset and therefore fully captures the structure of the polytope. Isomorphic polytopes give rise to isomorphic Hasse diagrams, and vice versa. The same is not generally true for the graph representation of polytopes.

=== Rank ===
The &quot;rank&quot; of a face F is defined as (&quot;m&quot; − 2), where &quot;m&quot; is the maximum number of faces in any chain (F&#x27;, F&quot;, ... , F) satisfying F&#x27; &lt; F&quot; &lt; ... &lt; F. F&#x27; is always the least face, F−1.

The &quot;rank&quot; of an abstract polytope P is the maximum rank n of any face. It is always the rank of the greatest face Fn.

The rank of a face or polytope usually corresponds to the &quot;dimension&quot; of its counterpart in traditional theory.

For some ranks, their face-types are named in the following table.
† Traditionally &quot;face&quot; has meant a rank 2 face or 2-face. In abstract theory the term &quot;face&quot; denotes a face of &quot;any&quot; rank.

===Flags===

In geometry, a flag is a maximal chain of faces, i.e. a (totally) ordered set Ψ of faces, each a subface of the next (if any), and such that Ψ is not a subset of any larger chain. Given any two distinct faces F, G in a flag, either F &lt; G or F &gt; G.

For example, {ø, a, ab, abc} is a flag in the triangle abc.

For a given polytope, all flags contain the same number of faces. Other posets do not, in general, satisfy this requirement.

===Sections===
Any subset P&#x27; of a poset P is a poset (with the same relation &lt;, restricted to P&#x27;).

In an abstract polytope, given any two faces &quot;F&quot;, &quot;H&quot; of P with &quot;F&quot; ≤ &quot;H&quot;, the set {&quot;G&quot; | &quot;F&quot; ≤ &quot;G&quot; ≤ &quot;H&quot;} is called a section of &quot;P&quot;, and denoted &quot;H&quot;/&quot;F&quot;. (In order theory, a section is called a closed interval of the poset and denoted [&quot;F&quot;, &quot;H&quot;].

For example, in the prism abcxyz (see diagram) the section xyz/ø (highlighted green) is the triangle

:{ø, x, y, z, xy, xz, yz, xyz}.

A &quot;k&quot;-section is a section of rank &quot;k&quot;.

P is thus a section of itself.

This concept of section &quot;does not&quot; have the same meaning as in traditional geometry.

====Facets====
The facet for a given &quot;j&quot;-face &quot;F&quot; is the (&quot;j&quot;−&quot;1&quot;)-section &quot;F&quot;/∅, where &quot;F&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the greatest face.

For example, in the triangle abc, the facet at ab is ab/∅ = {∅, a, b, ab}, which is a line segment.

The distinction between &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F&quot;/∅ is not usually significant and the two are often treated as identical.

====Vertex figures====
The vertex figure at a given vertex &quot;V&quot; is the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-section &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;/&quot;V&quot;, where &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the greatest face.

For example, in the triangle abc, the vertex figure at b is abc/b = {b, ab, bc, abc}, which is a line segment. The vertex figures of a cube are triangles.

====Connectedness====
A poset P is connected if P has rank ≤ 1, or, given any two proper faces F and G, there is a sequence of proper faces

:H1, H2, ... ,Hk

such that F = H1, G = Hk, and each Hi, i &lt; k, is incident with its successor.

The above condition ensures that a pair of disjoint triangles abc and xyz is &quot;not&quot; a (single) polytope.

A poset P is strongly connected if every section of P (including P itself) is connected.

With this additional requirement, two pyramids that share just a vertex are also excluded. However, two square pyramids, for example, &quot;can&quot;, be &quot;glued&quot; at their square faces - giving an octahedron. The &quot;common face&quot; is &quot;not&quot; then a face of the octahedron.

==Formal definition==
An abstract polytope is a partially ordered set, whose elements we call &quot;faces&quot;, satisfying the 4 axioms:

# It has just one least face and one greatest face.
# All flags contain the same number of faces.
# It is strongly connected.
# If the ranks of two faces &quot;a &gt; b&quot; differ by 2, then there are exactly 2 faces that lie strictly between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

An &quot;n&quot;-polytope is a polytope of rank &quot;n&quot;. The abstract polytope associated with a real convex polytope is also referred to as its face lattice.

==The simplest polytopes==

===Rank &lt; 1===
There is just one poset for each rank −1 and 0. These are, respectively, the null face and the point. These are not always considered to be valid abstract polytopes.

===Rank 1: the line segment===

There is only one polytope of rank 1, which is the line segment. It has a least face, just two 0-faces and a greatest face, for example {ø, a, b, ab}. It follows that the vertices a and b have rank 0, and that the greatest face ab, and therefore the poset, both have rank 1.

===Rank 2: polygons===
For each &quot;p&quot;, 3 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; formula_1, we have (the abstract equivalent of) the traditional polygon with &quot;p&quot; vertices and &quot;p&quot; edges, or a &quot;p&quot;-gon. For p = 3, 4, 5, ... we have the triangle, square, pentagon, ...

For &quot;p&quot; = 2, we have the digon, and &quot;p&quot; = formula_1 we get the apeirogon.

====The digon====

A digon is a polygon with just 2 edges. Unlike any other polygon, both edges have the same two vertices. For this reason, it is &quot;degenerate&quot; in the Euclidean plane.

Faces are sometimes described using &quot;vertex notation&quot; - e.g. {ø, a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc} for the triangle abc. This method has the advantage of &quot;implying&quot; the &lt; relation.

With the digon this vertex notation &quot;cannot be used&quot;. It is necessary to give the faces individual symbols and specify the subface pairs F &lt; G.

Thus, a digon is defined as a set {ø, a, b, E&#x27;, E&quot;, G} with the relation &lt; given by

:::{ø&lt;a, ø&lt;/ref&gt; Two realizations are called congruent if the natural bijection between their sets of vertices is induced by an isometry of their ambient Euclidean spaces.

If an abstract &quot;n&quot;-polytope is realized in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, such that the geometrical arrangement does not break any rules for traditional polytopes (such as curved faces, or ridges of zero size), then the realization is said to be &quot;faithful&quot;. In general, only a restricted set of abstract polytopes of rank &quot;n&quot; may be realized faithfully in any given &quot;n&quot;-space. The characterization of this effect is an outstanding problem.

For a regular abstract polytope, if the combinatorial automorphisms of the abstract polytope are realized by geometric symmetries then the geometric figure will be a regular polytope.

===Moduli space===
The group &quot;G&quot; of symmetries of a realization &quot;V&quot; of an abstract polytope &quot;P&quot; is generated by two reflections, the product of which translates each vertex of &quot;P&quot; to the next. The product of the two reflections can be decomposed as a product of a non-zero translation, finitely many rotations, and possibly trivial reflection.

Generally, the moduli space of realizations of an abstract polytope is a convex cone of infinite dimension. The realization cone of the abstract polytope has uncountably infinite algebraic dimension and cannot be closed in the Euclidean topology.

== The amalgamation problem and universal polytopes ==

An important question in the theory of abstract polytopes is the &quot;amalgamation problem&quot;. This is a series of questions such as

: For given abstract polytopes &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, are there any polytopes &quot;P&quot; whose facets are &quot;K&quot; and whose vertex figures are &quot;L&quot; ?
: If so, are they all finite ?
: What finite ones are there ?

For example, if &quot;K&quot; is the square, and &quot;L&quot; is the triangle, the answers to these questions are

: Yes, there are polytopes &quot;P&quot; with square faces, joined three per vertex (that is, there are polytopes of type {4,3}).
: Yes, they are all finite, specifically,
: There is the cube, with six square faces, twelve edges and eight vertices, and the hemi-cube, with three faces, six edges and four vertices.

It is known that if the answer to the first question is &#x27;Yes&#x27; for some regular &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, then there is a unique polytope whose facets are &quot;K&quot; and whose vertex figures are &quot;L&quot;, called the universal polytope with these facets and vertex figures, which covers all other such polytopes. That is, suppose &quot;P&quot; is the universal polytope with facets &quot;K&quot; and vertex figures &quot;L&quot;. Then any other polytope &quot;Q&quot; with these facets and vertex figures can be written &quot;Q&quot;=&quot;P&quot;/&quot;N&quot;, where
* &quot;N&quot; is a subgroup of the automorphism group of &quot;P&quot;, and
* &quot;P&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is the collection of orbits of elements of &quot;P&quot; under the action of &quot;N&quot;, with the partial order induced by that of &quot;P&quot;.
&quot;Q&quot;=&quot;P&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is called a quotient of &quot;P&quot;, and we say &quot;P&quot; covers &quot;Q&quot;.

Given this fact, the search for polytopes with particular facets and vertex figures usually goes as follows:
# Attempt to find the applicable universal polytope
# Attempt to classify its quotients.
These two problems are, in general, very difficult.

Returning to the example above, if &quot;K&quot; is the square, and &quot;L&quot; is the triangle, the universal polytope {&quot;K&quot;,&quot;L&quot;} is the cube (also written {4,3}). The hemicube is the quotient {4,3}/&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is a group of symmetries (automorphisms) of the cube with just two elements - the identity, and the symmetry that maps each corner (or edge or face) to its opposite.

If &quot;L&quot; is, instead, also a square, the universal polytope {&quot;K&quot;,&quot;L&quot;} (that is, {4,4}) is the tessellation of the Euclidean plane by squares. This tessellation has infinitely many quotients with square faces, four per vertex, some regular and some not. Except for the universal polytope itself, they all correspond to various ways to tessellate either a torus or an infinitely long cylinder with squares.

===The 11-cell and the 57-cell===

The 11-cell, discovered independently by H. S. M. Coxeter and Branko Grünbaum, is an abstract 4-polytope. Its facets are hemi-icosahedra. Since its facets are, topologically, projective planes instead of spheres, the 11-cell is not a tessellation of any manifold in the usual sense. Instead, the 11-cell is a &quot;locally&quot; projective polytope. It is self-dual and universal: it is the &quot;only&quot; polytope with hemi-icosahedral facets and hemi-dodecahedral vertex figures.

The 57-cell is also self-dual, with hemi-dodecahedral facets. It was discovered by H. S. M. Coxeter shortly after the discovery of the 11-cell. Like the 11-cell, it is also universal, being the only polytope with hemi-dodecahedral facets and hemi-icosahedral vertex figures. On the other hand, there are many other polytopes with hemi-dodecahedral facets and Schläfli type {5,3,5}. The universal polytope with hemi-dodecahedral facets and icosahedral (not hemi-icosahedral) vertex figures is finite, but very large, with 10006920 facets and half as many vertices.

=== Local topology ===

The amalgamation problem has, historically, been pursued according to &quot;local topology&quot;. That is, rather than restricting &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; to be particular polytopes, they are allowed to be any polytope with a given topology, that is, any polytope tessellating a given manifold. If &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are &quot;spherical&quot; (that is, tessellations of a topological sphere), then &quot;P&quot; is called &quot;locally spherical&quot; and corresponds itself to a tessellation of some manifold. For example, if &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are both squares (and so are topologically the same as circles), &quot;P&quot; will be a tessellation of the plane, torus or Klein bottle by squares. A tessellation of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold is actually a rank &quot;n&quot; + 1 polytope. This is in keeping with the common intuition that the Platonic solids are three dimensional, even though they can be regarded as tessellations of the two-dimensional surface of a ball.

In general, an abstract polytope is called &quot;locally X&quot; if its facets and vertex figures are, topologically, either spheres or &quot;X&quot;, but not both spheres. The 11-cell and 57-cell are examples of rank 4 (that is, four-dimensional) &quot;locally projective&quot; polytopes, since their facets and vertex figures are tessellations of real projective planes. There is a weakness in this terminology however. It does not allow an easy way to describe a polytope whose facets are tori and whose vertex figures are projective planes, for example. Worse still if different facets have different topologies, or no well-defined topology at all. However, much progress has been made on the complete classification of the locally toroidal regular polytopes 

== Exchange maps ==

Let &quot;Ψ&quot; be a flag of an abstract &quot;n&quot;-polytope, and let −1 &lt; &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. From the definition of an abstract polytope, it can be proven that there is a unique flag differing from &quot;Ψ&quot; by a rank &quot;i&quot; element, and the same otherwise. If we call this flag &quot;Ψ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;), then this defines a collection of maps on the polytopes flags, say &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot;. These maps are called exchange maps, since they swap pairs of flags : (&quot;Ψφ&quot;&quot;i&quot;)&quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;Ψ&quot; always. Some other properties of the exchange maps :
* &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot;2 is the identity map
* The &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot; generate a group. (The action of this group on the flags of the polytope is an example of what is called the flag action of the group on the polytope)
* If |&quot;i&quot; − &quot;j&quot;| &gt; 1, &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;φ&quot;&quot;j&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;&quot;j&quot;&quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot;
* If &quot;α&quot; is an automorphism of the polytope, then &quot;αφ&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;α&quot;
* If the polytope is regular, the group generated by the &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot; is isomorphic to the automorphism group, otherwise, it is strictly larger.
The exchange maps and the flag action in particular can be used to prove that &quot;any&quot; abstract polytope is a quotient of some regular polytope.

==Incidence matrices==
A polytope can also be represented by tabulating its incidences.

The following incidence matrix is that of a triangle:
The table shows a 1 wherever a face is a subface of another, &quot;or vice versa&quot; (so the table is symmetric about the diagonal)- so in fact, the table has &quot;redundant information&quot;; it would suffice to show only a 1 when the row face ≤ the column face.

Since both the body and the empty set are incident with all other elements, the first row and column as well as the last row and column are trivial and can conveniently be omitted.

=== Square pyramid ===
Further information is gained by counting each occurrence. This numerative usage enables a symmetry grouping, as in the Hasse Diagram of the square pyramid: If vertices B, C, D, and E are considered symmetrically equivalent within the abstract polytope, then edges f, g, h, and j will be grouped together, and also edges k, l, m, and n, And finally also the triangles P, Q, R, and S. Thus the corresponding incidence matrix of this abstract polytope may be shown as:

In this accumulated incidence matrix representation the diagonal entries represent the total counts of either element type.

Elements of different type of the same rank clearly are never incident so the value will always be 0; however, to help distinguish such relationships, an asterisk (*) is used instead of 0.

The sub-diagonal entries of each row represent the incidence counts of the relevant sub-elements, while the super-diagonal entries represent the respective element counts of the vertex-, edge- or whatever -figure.

Already this simple square pyramid shows that the symmetry-accumulated incidence matrices are no longer symmetrical. But there is still a simple entity-relation (beside the generalised Euler formulae for the diagonal, respectively the sub-diagonal entities of each row, respectively the super-diagonal elements of each row - those at least whenever no holes or stars etc. are considered), as for any such incidence matrix formula_3 holds:

formula_4

== History ==
In the 1960s Branko Grünbaum issued a call to the geometric community to consider generalizations of the concept of regular polytopes that he called &quot;polystromata&quot;. He developed a theory of polystromata, showing examples of new objects including the 11-cell.

The 11-cell is a self-dual 4-polytope whose facets are not icosahedra, but are &quot;hemi-icosahedra&quot; — that is, they are the shape one gets if one considers opposite faces of the icosahedra to be actually the &quot;same&quot; face (Grünbaum, 1977). A few years after Grünbaum&#x27;s discovery of the 11-cell, H.S.M. Coxeter discovered a similar polytope, the 57-cell (Coxeter 1982, 1984), and then independently rediscovered the 11-cell.

With the earlier work by Branko Grünbaum, H. S. M. Coxeter and Jacques Tits having laid the groundwork, the basic theory of the combinatorial structures now known as abstract polytopes was first described by Egon Schulte in his 1980 PhD dissertation. In it he defined &quot;regular incidence complexes&quot; and &quot;regular incidence polytopes&quot;. Subsequently, he and Peter McMullen developed the basics of the theory in a series of research articles that were later collected into a book. Numerous other researchers have since made their own contributions, and the early pioneers (including Grünbaum) have also accepted Schulte&#x27;s definition as the &quot;correct&quot; one.

Since then, research in the theory of abstract polytopes has focused mostly on &quot;regular&quot; polytopes, that is, those whose automorphism groups act transitively on the set of flags of the polytope.

<doc id="1211065" wikidata="Q34992" url="?curid=1211065" title="Annobonese Creole">
<text>Annobonese Creole is a Portuguese creole known to its speakers as &#x27; or &#x27; (). It is spoken on the Annobón and Bioko Islands off the coast of Equatorial Guinea, mostly by people of mixed African, Portuguese and Spanish descent. It is called or in Spanish.

The attitude in Equatorial Guinea towards this language is positive. It is taught in special courses in the capital city of Malabo.

== History ==
Annobonese originated sometime during the 16th century as an offshoot of Forro Creol, while this stage of Annobonese is unattested remaining linguistic traces show this. The creole language was spoken originally by the descendants of intermixing between Portuguese men and African women slaves imported from other places, especially from São Tomé and Angola, and therefore descends from Portuguese and Forro, the creole of the freed slaves of São Tomé. The government of Equatorial Guinea financed an Instituto Internacional da Língua Portuguesa (IILP) sociolinguistic study in Annobón, which noticed strong links with the Portuguese creole populations in São Tomé and Príncipe, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau.

The language was first attested in an article called &quot;Negerportugiesische von Annobom.&quot; &quot;Sitzungsberichte der philosophisch&quot; (Negro Portuguese by Annobom. Meeting reports of the philosophical). Which was written by Hugo Schuchart in 1888.

The Annobonese population was relatively isolated from the outside world, as their island was too small to a major trade center and wasn&#x27;t near any major trade routes. After Annobón island was taken over by the Portuguese the language absorbed very little influence from Spanish. Though Spanish influence would gradually influence it as Annobón became further integrated.

Today Annobonese is a thriving language as it is the first language of nearly all of the Annobonese people. The language is used in all aspects of society but the language is never written. Practically all Annobonese are bilingual in other languages including Pidgin English, Spanish, Bubi and Fang.

== Phonology ==
Diphthongs: Ej, Aj, Uj

The syllable structure of Annobonese syllable structure is almost exclusively CV-CV-C(V) with that final vowel being omitted. Words that start with a vowel are rare but do exist, examples being &quot;oyo&quot; meaning eye or &quot;abada&quot; meaning fruit.

Vowels are usually pronounced as short vowels but can be pronounced a long vowels though this rarely changes the meaning of a lexeme. The majority of words in Annobonese are not dependent on tone but there are a few words that use tone to differentiate between different words. There are two tones use for this purpose and high tone and a low tone, long vowels are always pronounced with a hight tone.

==Grammar==
Some features of the Creole:

=== Pronouns ===
=== Simple sentences ===
Fa d’Ambô follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. Sentences that are ditransitive (they include a direct object pronoun as well as an indirect object pronoun) must place the indirect object before the direct object. An indirect object is not marked by a preposition in Fa d’Ambô. The table below displays one sentence translated across Fa d’Ambô, Portuguese, and English to further highlight this specific matter:

The word-for-word English translation of &quot;Pay da mina dyielu&quot; would be &quot;Father give child money.&quot; In Portuguese, the preposition &quot;a&quot; precedes the indirect object &quot;a menina&quot; (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;a&quot; contract into &quot;à&quot;), forming the overall meaning &quot;... to the child.&quot; Fa d’Ambô lacks the use of this type of prepositional marker before indirect objects.

=== Noun classification ===
Nouns of Annobonese Creole are generally invariable, without employing grammatical gender or class. However, to express the specific gender of an animate noun to differentiate something that is male versus female, &quot;napay&quot; (male, man) or &quot;miela&quot; (female) may be added to the root word. For example: &quot;napay&quot; may be joined with &quot;mina&quot; (child) to form &quot;napay mina&quot; (boy, son). Actually the correct form would be &quot;mina napay&quot; (child male) and &quot;mina namay&quot; (child female). The same may be done with &quot;miela&quot; + &quot;mina&quot; = &quot;miela mina&quot; (girl, daughter). Again (&quot;mina miela&quot;) - (young woman, an adolecense). In contrast, for a young male, na-nome (nanome) is used. 
In a sense, namay is female and miela is a woman. Nampay or nome is male.

=== Plurality ===
The plurality of a noun in Annobonese Creole usually goes unmarked (Ø) due to the fact that it can be implied from the context in which the noun fits within a sentence or clause. If the plurality cannot be directly implied and a type of plurality marker is necessary, there are a few ways in which to do so:

# Employ a plural demonstrative (i.e. these, those). Example: &quot;galafa&quot; (bottle) + &quot;-nensyi&quot; (those) = &quot;galafa nensyi&quot; (those bottles)
# Employ a numeral adjective. Example: &quot;canoe&quot; (canoe) + &quot;tisyi&quot; (three) = &quot;canoe tisyi&quot; (three canoes)
# Employ a quantitative adjective. Example: &quot;xadyi&quot; (house) + &quot;muntu&quot; (much) = &quot;xadyi muntu&quot; (many houses)
# Reduplicate the noun (full reduplication). Note that this specific plurality marker indicates the inclusion of all members of a noun. Example: &quot;ngolo&quot; (shell) + &quot;ngolo&quot; = &quot;ngolo ngolo&quot; (all the shells)

=== Articles ===
Articles are only used in the language when speakers feel they are necessary. When they are included, they are positioned directly before the noun. The definite article utilizes one form for both the singular and plural forms of nouns, &quot;na&quot;. The indefinite article can appear as either &quot;wan&quot; or &quot;an&quot; for nouns in the singular form and &quot;zuguan&quot; for the plural counterparts. Example: The Annobonese sentence &quot;Na may banku&quot; translates to English as &quot;The white woman&quot;, where &quot;na&quot; is the definite article &quot;the&quot;, &quot;may&quot; signifies &quot;woman&quot;, and &quot;banku&quot; serves as the color adjective &quot;white.&quot; The indefinite article is used in the example in the section above regarding word order, where &quot;wan&quot; serves to mark an undefined &quot;xat&quot; (letter): &quot;No skéve wan xat&quot; (We write a letter).

Combinations of articles with plurality markers (refer to plurality section above) are also common in the language. These combinations can aid to clarify the plurality of definite articles, seeing as they have no plural form on their own. Example: &quot;Na mina nensyi&quot; (These/those children). &quot;Nensyi&quot; serves as the plural demonstrative &quot;these&quot; or &quot;those.&quot; &quot;Na mina,&quot; without the implementation of the plural demonstrative, could be interpreted as singular &quot;the child&quot; rather than plural &quot;the children&quot;, assuming context is unknown.

==Lexicon==

Annobonese is analogous to Forro. In fact, it may be derived from Forro as it shares the same structure and 82% of its lexicon. After Annobón passed to Spain, the language incorporated some words of Spanish origin (10% of its lexicon), but it is often difficult to say from which language a word derives, given the similarity between Spanish and Portuguese.

<text>The Equitable Building is an office skyscraper located at 120 Broadway between Pine and Cedar streets in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. The skyscraper was designed by Ernest R. Graham in the neoclassical style, with Peirce Anderson as the architect-in-charge. It is tall, with 38 stories and of floor space. The building&#x27;s articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital.

The Equitable Building replaced the Equitable Life Building, the previous headquarters of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, which burned down in 1912. Work on the Equitable Building started in 1913 and was completed in 1915. Upon opening, it was the largest office building in the world by floor area. The Equitable Building hosted a variety of tenants and, by the 1920s, was the most valuable building in New York City. The Equitable Life Insurance Company, the building&#x27;s namesake, occupied a small portion of the building until it moved out during 1960. The owner , Silverstein Properties, purchased the Equitable Building in 1980 and has renovated it multiple times.

Upon its completion, the Equitable Building was controversial because of its lack of setbacks, which in turn does not allow sunlight to reach the surrounding ground. This contributed to the adoption of the first modern building and zoning restrictions on vertical structures in Manhattan, the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978 and was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1996. It is also a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, a NRHP district created in 2007.

==Site==

The building occupies the entire block bounded by Broadway to the west, Cedar Street to the north, Nassau Street to the east, and Pine Street to the south. The dimensions of the block are irregular. The building has a frontage of approximately on Broadway, on Cedar Street, on Nassau Street, and on Pine Street. The plot is shaped like a trapezoid, with the Nassau Street and Broadway frontages being almost parallel. The plot covers about ; according to the New York City Department of City Planning, the building has a lot area of . The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10271; it was one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that had their own ZIP Codes .

There are numerous buildings and structures immediately adjacent to the Equitable Building. Zuccotti Park is located to the northwest, while 140 Broadway is to the north and 28 Liberty Street is to the northeast. Federal Hall National Memorial is to the southeast and 14 Wall Street and the American Surety Building are to the south. Across Broadway to the west and southwest are the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings.

==Architecture==
The Equitable Building, an early skyscraper, was designed by Ernest R. Graham of D. H. Burnham &amp; Company (later Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White), with Peirce Anderson as the architect-in-charge. In contrast to the contemporary Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, Singer Building, and Woolworth Building, the Equitable Building was designed as a bulky mass, rather than a &quot;slender, romantic tower&quot;. This was affected by the fact that the other three buildings were corporate symbols from renowned architects, while the Equitable Building was a speculative development whose designer had little experience in New York City. The ultimate design was distinct from corporate structures such as the Met Life Tower or restrained office buildings such as the Flatiron Building, and raised substantial controversy upon its completion.

The articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The exterior is inspired from Greek and Roman architecture. In total, it is tall when the penthouse&#x27;s center tower is included; a separate measurement of is given when measured to the top of the other penthouses, and the height excluding any of the penthouses is .

=== Form ===
Although the Equitable Building is 40 stories tall with , this includes two stories in the building&#x27;s penthouses as well as two &quot;interior stories&quot; that are not visible from the facade. The interior stories are located at the 3rd and 34th floors, and there are three basement levels. The exterior of the building thus consists of 36 stories with a total height of . Originally, the structure was proposed as a 42-story skyscraper, but this was reduced to 36 effective stories to maximize elevator safety and speed, given the assumption that 50,000 people visited the building each day and that there were 48 elevators that could each serve 1,200 people an hour.

The Equitable Building has no setback from the street beyond the depth of the sidewalk. This is because Graham wanted the building to have the latest technological systems, such as elevators, heating, ventilation, and fireproofing, while also maximizing usable office space. Two light courts (recesses), one each to the east and west, bisect the facades above the seventh floor. As a result, the Equitable Building appears in the shape of the letter H when viewed from above. The design of the Equitable Building is similar to that of the now-demolished Hudson Terminal office buildings and the 49 Chambers building. The two-story penthouse is tall; the penthouse roof is tall, but the center tower rises another .

=== Facade ===

The building&#x27;s facade is made of brick, granite, and terracotta, and white Yule Marble and iron are also used in the building. The granite, brick, and marble were estimated to be . Anderson designed the facade with a base, shaft, and capital, similar to the Broadway–Chambers Building by Cass Gilbert, but with facades on all sides. The building contains eighteen vertical window bays each on the Pine and Cedar Street facades, and seven bays each on the Broadway and Nassau Street facades, three on each wing of the &quot;H&quot;. The window bays each consist of two windows on each floor, except the center bay on Broadway and Nassau Street, which includes three windows on the 5th through 7th floors.

The lowest four stories were made of granite, while the 5th through 7th stories have a facade of granite and terracotta. On Broadway and Nassau Street, there are Corinthian-style pilasters, which are tall and topped by ornamented capitals. Double-height arches with three revolving doors are located at the centers of these facades. Above this is a plaque reading on the third story, as well as an ornamented terracotta frieze at the fourth story, which is wide. The entrances on Cedar Street and Pine Street are more plainly designed with narrower square arches; the doors are located below green marble panels. The remaining windows on the first floor are stainless-steel show windows, which illuminate the commercial spaces inside. Though most of the commercial space is accessed from the lobby, there is also a service entrance and a shop entrance from the Cedar Street side. The window openings on the second, third, fifth, and sixth floors are separated by vertical mullions and horizontal spandrel panels made of green terracotta. Flagpoles hang from the seventh story.

The 8th through 38th stories were made of light gray brick and matching terracotta trim. On the Broadway and Nassau Street facades, the light court divides the primary facades into two wings, each with three window bays. The portions of the facade facing these light courts are faced with brick. Medallions with cornices are located at the corners of the building at the 7th and 31st floors. There is no ornamentation on the 8th through 30th floors, while there are belt courses below the 31st and 32nd floors. The facade between the 32nd and 35th floors is composed of a colonnade with terracotta pilasters between each column of windows, topped by ornamented capitals. The colonnade terminates at the top of the 35th floor, where there is an elaborate cornice. Another belt course separates the 36th and 37th floors, and a cornice is located above the 38th floor.

The top of the building, composed of the penthouse, is faced with brick and terracotta. It contains pilasters similar to the lower sections of the building. The main penthouse, atop the center of the &quot;H&quot;, has dimensions of . Penthouses are located atop the wings as well.

=== Features ===
Upon its completion, the Equitable Building was the largest office building in the world by total area. The building had of floor space, and each of the upper stories has due to the H-shaped footprints. A fact sheet published at the time of the Equitable Building&#x27;s completion estimated that it had approximately 5,000 windows and 10,000 doors.

==== Structural features ====
The foundations descended to below ground level. The foundation is surrounded by a concrete cofferdam which measures wide and is reinforced by steel rods. Within the foundation are eighty piers, each of made of concrete and steel. A retaining wall between Cedar and Pine Streets is used to reinforce two of the cellar levels for vaults. The superstructure weighs . At the time of the Equitable Building&#x27;s construction, it was described as the world&#x27;s heaviest structure. There are 88 granite columns that rest on the piers within the foundation, and another 50 columns that rest atop the cofferdam.

==== Interior ====

The ground-floor lobby is composed of two perpendicular arcades, a west-east corridor from Broadway to Nassau Street and a north-south corridor from Pine to Cedar Streets. All four entrances contained bronze revolving doors. The lobby has a pink marble floor, sand-colored marble walls, and a vaulted, coffered ceiling. The corridors are wide, while the ceiling ranges from tall at the edges to tall at the center. The ceiling is designed in patterns of octagons and squares. Also in the lobby are the elevators, which contain marble-and-bronze doors and are located in the central section of the &quot;H&quot;. Banking spaces and storefronts are also located on the ground floor, accessible from the lobby. To the southeast and northwest, marble stairs with balustrades lead to the basements and second floor.

The first basement level has safe-deposit vaults designed by Frederick S. Holmes. In the basement, there are also connections to several New York City Subway stations, including Wall Street (served by the ), Wall Street (served by the ), and Broad Street (served by the ). At opening, half of the basement was occupied by the Cafe Savarin, a 1,000-seat eatery with three rooms fitted with bright blue tiled walls and floors.

On the upper floors, a staircase, restrooms, and utilities are clustered into the core of the &quot;H&quot;. The light courts within the &quot;H&quot; ensured that all offices could receive natural light. West-east corridors ran perpendicularly to the elevator lobbies, crossing both wings of the &quot;H&quot;. Floors were arranged so that they could be divided into suites facing outward, so that all suites faced windows, though it was also possible for lessees to rent entire floors. Upon the building&#x27;s opening, Equitable also provided rest and recreation rooms for the building&#x27;s 2,000 female employees, making it the first large building to have a women&#x27;s welfare department. Also in the building was the library of the New York Law Institute, which remains in the building .

The Equitable Building housed the 1,500-member Bankers Club on its top three floors when it opened. The club had five dining rooms, a lounge, reception rooms, and an open-air terrace. The club was highly frequented by notable financial figures and socialites in New York City, hosting politicians and leaders such as United Kingdom prime minister Winston Churchill, French president Charles de Gaulle, Soviet Union leader Nikita Khrushchev, and Queen of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II. It closed in 1979 after the club&#x27;s lease expired.

====Mechanical features ====
The operations of the Equitable Building were described as being akin to a small city. When the building opened, there was a power station below ground level. It contained seven boilers with a combined output of , which took up a space measuring . There was also an artificial ice plant. The power station originally burned oil, consuming 2.5 million barrels per year, but started using coal in 1934 due to a rise in fuel prices. At the time of completion, the Equitable Building was said to have more telephones than did all of Greece.

The building contains 50 elevators; the 48 elevators serving the above ground levels are clustered in six groups of eight, while an additional two elevators serve the basements. The Equitable Building previously contained as many as 62 elevators.

==History==

=== Context ===

During the 19th century, life insurance firms were some of the first companies to build high-profile skyscrapers. The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, founded by Henry Baldwin Hyde in 1859, had built the Equitable Life Building on 120 Broadway in 1870. The Equitable Life Building was the first office building to feature passenger elevators, and at a record upon construction, was among the world&#x27;s first skyscrapers. The building was expanded numerous times, including in 1875 and in 1887. Equitable assumed control of all properties on the block by 1906. By the 1890s, the Equitable Life Building was architecturally outdated, and George B. Post prepared plans for a 40-story structure in 1897, which did not proceed.

In 1907, Daniel H. Burnham&#x27;s company had proposed replacing the Equitable Life Building with a 33-story structure. At the time, both Burnham and Equitable publicly denied that a new home office was being planned. Burnham&#x27;s firm filed plans for a 62-story building in 1908, to top the Singer Building and Metropolitan Life Tower. This new building would have had a 34-story base and a 28-story tower, being tall, with of floor area and 3,600 offices. Although bidding for the proposed structure began in December 1908, Equitable president Paul Morton publicly denied plans for a new structure. The plan was ultimately dropped, possibly due to opposition over the building&#x27;s sheer bulk.
The Equitable Life Building was destroyed by a fire on January 9, 1912, which killed six people. Fire engines could not save the structure because the water from the engines had frozen in the cold weather. Equitable quickly set up temporary quarters at the City Investing Building. Given that the previous building had been worth very little, the land was actually worth more after the fire than beforehand.

=== Planning and construction ===
==== Planning ====
After the fire, Thompson–Starrett was hired to clear the site, and the plot was chosen as the location for Equitable&#x27;s new headquarters building. Thompson–Starrett president Louis J. Horowitz approached businessman T. Coleman du Pont, who later recalled that du Pont was interested in the &quot;idea of owning a gigantic building in New York&quot;. Frank M. Andrews—who also designed the Hotel McAlpin for du Pont—was involved in the project as well. Horowitz, Andrews, and du Pont were said to have bought the lot in August 1912, and finalized the sale that October for $13.5 million.

Du Pont forced Andrews from the project, apparently upon Horowitz&#x27;s advice, and Andrews sued du Pont in July 1913, leading du Pont to pay Andrews $100,000 for his involvement. Horowitz then corresponded with Ernest Graham, the other major partner at D. H. Burnham &amp; Company after Burnham&#x27;s June 1912 death, who would become the architect of the new tower. Graham designed the structure as a bulky mass, wanting to maximize the amount of office space on the site rather than a corporate symbol. Graham&#x27;s key concern was with the height of the elevators, and he discussed the issue with preeminent elevator engineer Charles E. Knox, who said that &quot;the elevator service will determine the height of the building&quot;. This differed from Graham&#x27;s previous commissions, where elevators were considered after the height of the building was specified. Knox ultimately recommended against building a 42-story structure, but recommended a 36-story edifice since that height could meet the client&#x27;s safety and speed criteria.

Opposition to the building soon coalesced. One group of bankers planned to build a park on the site, a suggestion that Horowitz said &quot;outranks, for nerve, anything of which I ever heard&quot;, and was dropped when Horowitz suggested that the group raise $13.5 million to buy out du Pont&#x27;s ownership share. Another proposal called for dividing the lot in half by extending New Street, an existing north-south road, north to Cedar Street. This plan also failed, and blueprints were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in December 1912, which called for a huge H-shaped edifice on the block. On April 12, 1913, du Pont formed the Equitable Office Building Corporation to take title to the building site, and gave Equitable a $20.5 million mortgage loan to run for 60 years. Equitable would lease three floors in exchange for 9% dividends in the building corporation, to be paid in perpetuity. Equitable president William A. Day was appointed as chairman of the board of the building corporation. Thompson–Starrett was hired as the builder and Horowitz became the &quot;owner&#x27;s representative&quot;.

==== Construction ====

Because of the high land cost, the developers wanted to erect the building as quickly as possible; at the time, buildings&#x27; general contractors usually passed work down to subcontractors. To eliminate delays due to a lack of communication between subcontractors, the building corporation formed a &quot;Method of Procedure&quot; to coordinate all work on the building. Since there were no nearby material-storage areas, it was imperative that work be completed as quickly as possible. The start of work had already been held up by opposition to the proposed height and shape.

Excavation for the building started in June 1913. The cofferdam around the foundation was initially reinforced with timber cross-bracing until the steel frame underground had been sufficiently completed to support the cofferdam. During excavation, a cannonball from British colonial times was excavated from the site of the Equitable Building. By January 1914, crews had excavated the foundation and dug to the bedrock below street level. The steel work was built to the second floor using six derricks; the steel frame above that point was erected using lighter derricks with longer masts and booms. There were some accidents during construction, including two incidents in which workers were killed. One worker died after a crane fell on the Broadway side of the building, while another died when a crane dropped a girder onto a platform where six men were working.

The steel frame reached street level in February 1914. The cornerstone was officially laid on April 30, 1914, at a ceremony attended by mayor John Purroy Mitchel. The Equitable Building was the first private construction project in New York City where the mayor attended the cornerstone-laying ceremony. Work on the superstructure officially began on June 10, 1914. By August 16, the structure had topped out at 38 stories above the ground level. Work on the building was completed on February 1, 1915.

=== Use ===
The Equitable Building was completed on May 1, 1915, at an estimated cost of $29 million, . The Equitable Society itself occupied , a little more than 10% of the total floor area, on the sixth through eighth floors. Other early lessees included tenants as diverse as General Electric, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fidelity Trust Company, and American Smelting &amp; Refining. The Equitable Building was also occupied by industrial concerns such as the American Can Company, Kennecott Copper Company, E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and Aluminum Company of America, as well as railroads such as Missouri Pacific Railroad, Union Pacific Railroad, and Southern Railway. The Equitable Building&#x27;s other tenants included banks such as Barclays, Marine Midland Bank, and Mellon Bank; financial firms such as Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and American Express; and the offices of New York attorney general Robert Abrams. Equitable Life itself only had its home office in the Equitable Building until 1924, when it moved to 393 Seventh Avenue (now 11 Penn Plaza).

==== 1910s through 1930s ====

At the time of its completion, the Equitable Building had 20,000 employees working inside it, and 50,000 additional daily visitors. Shortly after the official opening, du Pont bought the Equitable Life Assurance Company&#x27;s controlling interest. During the first year of operation, du Pont made $3 million in profit. By 1917, the building was fully occupied at an average rental rate of . The building&#x27;s valuation was increased from $20.5 million to $25 million that year, because of a prosperous realty market at the time. The following year, the Equitable Office Building Corporation applied for a reduction in the building&#x27;s valuation from $25 million to $18 million, due to foreclosures on other large buildings in New York City. Further devaluation occurred in 1921, when the building was estimated to be worth $11.5 million, but by the next year, the building was re-valued at $30 million, making it among the city&#x27;s most valuable properties.

The edifice was first placed for sale in 1923, with du Pont offering the building for $40 million. In 1925, du Pont sold the Equitable Building for $38.5 million to the New York Empire Company, a subsidiary of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The next year, the Brotherhood sold the building to a syndicate composed of William Henry Vanderbilt, Harry C. Cushing III, and Leroy W. Baldwin for $40 million. By 1928, the Equitable Building was assessed at $31 million, making it the highest-valued building in New York City.

==== 1940s through 1960s ====
By the 1940s, the Equitable Office Building Corporation was in poor financial shape. Bankruptcy proceedings started in 1940, but were delayed due to World War II; three potential investors submitted dueling proposals in 1946. The building was refinanced in 1947, receiving a first-mortgage loan of $14.5 million, among the largest ever in New York City&#x27;s history. At this time, Equitable Life sold the mortgage on the tower.

In 1954, Webb and Knapp bought all of the Equitable Office Building Corporation&#x27;s common stock, and thereby acquired ownership of the building. Lawrence Wien bought the lease for the land in 1956, though Webb and Knapp retained ownership of the building as well as its operating sublease. By then, Equitable was planning to build the new 1285 Avenue of the Americas on Sixth Avenue between 51st and 52nd streets in Midtown Manhattan. Two years later, the Equitable Life Assurance Company bought the building outright, as part of a $25 million exchange wherein Webb and Knapp bought the Sixth Avenue plot. In addition, Wien assumed the building&#x27;s operating sublease the same year. Equitable moved to 1285 Avenue of the Americas in 1961 from its previous home office at 393 Seventh Avenue.

==== 1970s to present ====
The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978. Silverstein Properties purchased the Equitable Building in 1980 for $60 million, in partnership with five pension funds whose mortgage nearly covered the purchase price. After buying the building, Larry Silverstein renovated and restored it at a cost of $30 million, to a design by Ehrenkrantz, Eckstut &amp; Whitelaw. The project entailed replacing the terracotta ornamentation, as well as the original terracotta frames for the windows, which was replaced with glass-fiber reinforced plastic. The window sash and main entrances were also replaced, and the lobby was refurbished. The renovation was completed in 1990. As a result of the project, occupancy rates increased from 60% in 1991 to 80% in 1993. Following the early 1990s recession, Silverstein sold his ownership stake and leased the Equitable Building, though Silverstein Properties bought it back in 1999. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Equitable Building a New York City landmark in 1996. Silverstein supported the city designation, and the commission wrote in its report that the Equitable Building was &quot;one of the finest office buildings of the era&quot;. In 2007, it was designated as a contributing property to the Wall Street Historic District, a NRHP district.

In 2017, Silverstein announced another round of renovations, which cost $50 million and were undertaken by Beyer Blinder Belle. The plan included restoring many historic features including the glass mosaic at the front entrance, the chandeliers in the lobby, and reopening the Bankers Club at the top of the building as an amenity space. The renovation also created twin rooftop terraces spanning a combined . The renovation was completed in July 2019. Several murals resembling street art were installed on the third floor in November 2019. Tenants include the New York City Department of City Planning, Macmillan Publishers, architecture firm Beyer Blinder Belle, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the New York City Housing Development Corporation, and Tower Research Capital.

== Notable incidents ==
There were numerous incidents where parts of the building were damaged. For instance, lightning caused part of the cornice to break off during 1925. In March 1942, a seven-inch (17 cm) shell struck the 37th floor of the building but caused little damage and no injuries. The shell was one of eight fired by an anti-aircraft battery near the East River by mistake; the other rounds fell harmlessly into the river. The 1942 incident made the Equitable Building the first in New York City to suffer war damage during World War II, and it subsequently took out an insurance policy. In February 1953, a broken water main flooded the basements with of water, temporarily disabling the elevators.

Throughout the Equitable Building&#x27;s history, several people have died after they fell or jumped from the building. In the building&#x27;s early years, such incidents included a clerk who landed on a taxi in 1925; a woman who jumped from the roof after losing money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929; a broker who jumped in 1937; and an incident in 1930 where a jumper killed both himself and a truck driver on the ground. There were also several people who killed themselves inside the building, such as the shooting suicide of a politician in 1933 and another one in 1937.

== Impact ==

=== Critical reception ===
Many architectural critics had negative comments about the Equitable Building. Francisco Mujica stated in 1927 that &quot;its intelligent interior arrangement and the central location of its 50 elevators&quot; was the only appealing part of the Equitable Building. Another critic called it a &quot;monstrous parasite on the veins and arteries of New York&quot;. Sally A. Kitt Chappell wrote that the Equitable Building &quot;was tall but without the redeeming slender, spirelike quality of a tower, and yet its height prevented it from having the urbanistic decorum of an office block&quot;. However, Chappell also wrote that the building had &quot;mitigate[d] two of the major evils of which skyscrapers were accused, as its fireproofing and elevator service attest.&quot;

There was also significant resistance to the building&#x27;s shape. Opponents stated that the building also overwhelmed nearby infrastructure by blocking ventilation, straining nearby transit facilities, and preventing firemen from easily reaching the upper floors. The shadow was more than six times the lot area and up to long. One journal stated that the Equitable Building cast a shadow on its surroundings, including a permanent shadow on the Singer Building up to its 27th floor and the City Investing Building up to its 24th floor, and completely cutting off sunshine to at least three other adjacent buildings shorter than 21 stories. Even during the cornerstone laying, Mayor Mitchel had alluded to the possibility that the Equitable Building might be the last bulky skyscraper to be erected in New York City.

=== Zoning law ===

The Equitable Building&#x27;s construction was one of the influences behind the passage of zoning reform in New York City. The &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; described the building as &quot;more famous for what it caused than what it is&quot;, although the Equitable Building was only one of the several catalysts of such reform.

Opposition to super-tall buildings dated as far back as 1894. Early attempts by Ernest Flagg to limit the height of New York&#x27;s skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the city&#x27;s property market entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The Committee on Congestion of Population in New York, as well as the Fifth Avenue Association, were among the groups that advocated for such legislation to limit building heights. The New York City Board of Aldermen&#x27;s Building Commission had published preliminary reports for zoning controls in 1913, when the Equitable Building was barely under construction. Nevertheless, in the following years, opponents of super-tall skyscrapers frequently cited the Equitable Building&#x27;s bulk.

After the Equitable Building&#x27;s completion, numerous nearby property owners filed for reduced property valuation assessments on the basis that significant rental income had been taken by the shadow that the building cast. Following the public criticism of the Equitable Building, the real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed. The legislation limited the height and required setbacks for new buildings to allow the penetration of sunlight to street level. New buildings were thus required to withdraw progressively at a defined angle from the street as they rose, in order to preserve sunlight and the open atmosphere in their surroundings. Chappell writes that if the Equitable Building were completed after the resolution&#x27;s passage, it would have had two setbacks below the 18th floor, and the building above that point would have been a small tower. The effort to place restrictions on land use in New York City led to the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act, a nationwide zoning legislation. The subsequent 1961 Zoning Resolution allowed the construction of bulky towers if they contained plazas.

<doc id="1211083" wikidata="Q976582" url="?curid=1211083" title="Kikuchi Dairoku">
<text>Baron was a Japanese mathematician, educator, and education administrator during the Meiji era. After earning degrees in mathematics and physics from St John&#x27;s College at the University of Cambridge, he became one of the first Japanese professors of mathematics at the University of Tokyo. Later in his life, he served as president of the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, Gakushuin, and the Riken Institute.

==Biography==

=== Early life and family ===
Kikuchi was born in Edo (present-day Tokyo), as the second son of Mitsukuri Shūhei, a professor at Bansho Shirabesho, himself the adopted son of Mitsukuri Gempo, a Shogunate professor. The Mitsukuri family had distinguished themselves as scholars, and were at the centre of Japan&#x27;s educational system in the Meiji era. His grandfather had been a student of Dutch studies (&quot;rangaku&quot;).

Kikuchi Dairoku changed his surname from Mitsukuri to Kikuchi upon succeeding as the heir to his father&#x27;s original family; the requisite legal procedures were completed in 1877.

=== Education ===
After attending the &quot;Bansho Shirabesho&quot;, the Shogunal institute for western studies, he was sent to Great Britain, in 1866, at age 11, the youngest of a group of Japanese sent by the Tokugawa shogunate to the University College School, on the advice of the then British foreign minister Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby.

Kikuchi returned to England in 1870 and was the first Japanese student to graduate from the University of Cambridge (St. John&#x27;s College) and the only one to graduate from the University of London in the 19th century. His specialisation was in physics and mathematics. In 1884 he attended the International Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C., and the master class of Kelvin in Baltimore.

=== Career ===
After returning to Japan, Kikuchi later became president of Tokyo Imperial University, Minister of Education (1901–1903) and president of Kyoto Imperial University. In 1909 he lectured in London on Japanese Education and 1910 at New York on New Japan: Its Intellectual and Moral Development.

His textbook on elementary geometry was the most widely used geometry textbook in Japan until the end of World War II.

Kikuchi was made a baron under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system in 1902 and was the eighth president of the Gakushūin Peers&#x27; School. In 1917 he became the first president of RIKEN, but died that same year.

==Family and issue==
Kikuchi&#x27;s children became well-known scientists, and his grandson Minobe Ryōkichi became governor of Tokyo.

<doc id="1211102" wikidata="Q2026082" url="?curid=1211102" title="Operation Fastlink">
<text>Operation Fastlink is a coordination of four separate, simultaneous undercover investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Cyber Division, the Department of Justice, the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Criminal Division and Interpol. The four different investigations have not been publicly enumerated, but the U.S. Department of Justice has said in at least one press release that &quot;Operation Higher Education&quot; is the largest component, with participation from twelve nations. Mention has also been made of an investigation into pre-release music groups led by FBI agents from the Washington Field Office. As of March 6, 2009, the FBI states that Operation Fastlink has yielded 60 convictions. The raids occurred in similar fashion to those from Operation Buccaneer and Operation Site Down. Other somewhat-related law enforcement actions include Operation Gridlock and Operation D-Elite.

The operation led to the successful busts of nearly 100 individuals involved in illegal copying of copyrighted software, and alterations thereof, worldwide. There were around 120 total searches executed in 27 American states and in 10 foreign countries. Foreign searches were conducted in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, as well as the United Kingdom.

Among the prolific warez release groups targeted by Fastlink were Fairlight, Kalisto, Echelon, Class, and DEViANCE—all of which specialized in spreading unlicensed copies of computer and console video games. Recent convictions have included members of music release groups Apocalypse Production Crew and Chromance.

<doc id="1211111" wikidata="Q2462300" url="?curid=1211111" title="Hideyuki Umezu">
<text>was a Japanese actor who specialized in voice acting.

==Biography==
Graduated from Tokyo Medical and Dental University, he said that if he hadn&#x27;t become an actor, he would have become a dentist.

The catalyst for starting acting was when a friend attending Waseda University expressed the desire to start acting and asked him to find a theatre club together. He found and joined the theatre group &quot;Kiryu&quot; at the same university. His friend later left the group.

Through connections, he began appearing in period dramas and pursued a career as an actor. As his roles in period dramas gradually became more significant, he received his first speaking role. However, after watching the senior actors&#x27; performances, he thought, &quot;Something&#x27;s different... What could it be?&quot; He realized that he hadn&#x27;t studied acting, so he enrolled in an actor training school and then joined the NHK Actors Seminar to study film acting. There, he was encouraged to enroll in the voice acting program due to his experience in period and contemporary dramas.

After gaining experience as a teaching assistant, he was told about voice acting opportunities and made his voice acting debut in 1982 as Dr. Hyblow in the television anime &quot;Cybot Robotchi&quot;.

Umezu went on to work with NPS Theatre, Arts Vision, and eventually joined 81 Produce. He died from interstitial pneumonia on May 17, 2024, at the age of 68.

<text>Transference () is a phenomenon within psychotherapy in which repetitions of old feelings, attitudes, desires, or fantasies that someone displaces are subconsciously projected onto a here-and-now person. Traditionally, it had solely concerned feelings from a primary relationship during childhood.

== History ==
Transference was first described by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, who considered it an important part of psychoanalytic treatment. Transference of this kind can be considered inappropriate without proper clinical supervision.

== Occurrence ==
It is common for people to transfer feelings about their parents to their partners or children (that is, cross-generational entanglements). Other examples of transference would be a person mistrusting somebody who resembles an ex-spouse in manners, voice, or external appearance, or being overly compliant to someone who resembles a childhood friend.

In &quot;The Psychology of the Transference&quot;, Carl Jung states that within the transference dyad, both participants typically experience a variety of opposites, that in love and in psychological growth, the key to success is the ability to endure the tension of the opposites without abandoning the process, and that this tension allows one to grow and to transform.

Only in a personally or socially harmful context can transference be described as a pathological issue. A modern, social-cognitive perspective on transference explains how it can occur in everyday life. When people meet a new person who reminds them of someone else, they unconsciously infer that the new person has traits similar to the person previously known. This perspective has generated a wealth of research that illuminated how people tend to repeat relationship patterns from the past in the present.

Sigmund Freud held that transference plays a large role in male homosexuality. In &quot;The Ego and the Id&quot;, he claimed that eroticism between males can be an outcome of a &quot;[psychically] non-economic&quot; hostility, which is unconsciously subverted into love and sexual attraction.

== Transference and counter-transference during psychotherapy ==

Transference will appear in the &quot;full speech&quot; that occurs during free association, revealing the inverse of the subject&#x27;s past, within the here and now, and the analyst will hear which of the four discourses the subject&#x27;s desire has been metonymically shifted to, beyond the ego, leading to a dystonic form of resistance.

In a therapy context, transference refers to redirection of a patient&#x27;s feelings for a significant person to the therapist. Transference is often manifested as an erotic attraction towards a therapist, but can be seen in many other forms such as rage, hatred, mistrust, parentification, extreme dependence, or even placing the therapist in a god-like or guru status. When Freud initially encountered transference in his therapy with patients, he thought he was encountering patient resistance, as he recognized the phenomenon when a patient refused to participate in a session of free association. But what he learned was that the analysis of the transference was actually the work that needed to be done: &quot;the transference, which, whether affectionate or hostile, seemed in every case to constitute the greatest threat to the treatment, becomes its best tool&quot;. The focus in psychodynamic psychotherapy is, in large part, the therapist and patient recognizing the transference relationship and exploring the relationship&#x27;s meaning. Since the transference between patient and therapist happens on an unconscious level, psychodynamic therapists who are largely concerned with a patient&#x27;s unconscious material use the transference to reveal unresolved conflicts patients have with childhood figures.

Countertransference
is defined as redirection of a therapist&#x27;s feelings toward a patient, or more generally, as a therapist&#x27;s emotional entanglement with a patient. A therapist&#x27;s attunement to their own countertransference is nearly as critical as understanding the transference. Not only does this help therapists regulate their emotions in the therapeutic relationship, but it also gives therapists valuable insight into what patients are attempting to elicit from them. For example, a therapist who is sexually attracted to a patient must understand the countertransference aspect (if any) of the attraction, and look at how the patient might be eliciting this attraction. Once any countertransference aspect has been identified, the therapist can ask the patient what his or her feelings are toward the therapist, and can explore how those feelings relate to unconscious motivations, desires, or fears.

Another contrasting perspective on transference and countertransference is offered in classical Adlerian psychotherapy. Rather than using the patient&#x27;s transference strategically in therapy, the positive or negative transference is diplomatically pointed out and explained as an obstacle to cooperation and improvement. For the therapist, any signs of countertransference would suggest that his or her own personal training analysis needs to be continued to overcome these tendencies. Andrea Celenza noted in 2010 that &quot;the use of the analyst&#x27;s countertransference remains a point of controversy&quot;.

<doc id="1211115" wikidata="Q3318972" url="?curid=1211115" title="Mohammad Yazdi">
<text>Mohammad Yazdi (; 2 July 1931 – 9 December 2020) was an Iranian conservative and principlist cleric who served as the head of Judiciary System of Iran between 1989 and 1999. In 2015, he was elected to lead Iran&#x27;s Assembly of Experts, defeating Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president, by a vote count of 47 to 24.

==Early life==
Mohammad Yazdi was born in 1931 to a religious family at Isfahan. Sheikh Ali Yazdi, his father, was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Haeri and at one of the Isfahan mosques as chief mullah for Friday prayers and ceremonies investigated the people&#x27;s problems.

===Education===

At first, Ayatollah Yazdi learned Persian language from his father and then went to Maktab. Also he departed to newly founded school to continue his education. When he went to Qom, he resided at the Feyziyeh School and learned religious courses from scholars such as Mohammad Ali Araki, Ayatollah Sheikh Muhammad Taqi Amoli, Ayatollah Shahroudi, Grand Ayatollah Hossein Borujerdi and Ruhollah Khomeini.

==Political career==

===Before victory of Iranian Revolution===

Ayatollah Yazdi usually gave the lectures at mosques and house of scholars. Also he taught Morality course at the Feyziyeh School and discussed politic subjects.
Mohammad Yazdi was exiled by SAVAK many times to Bandar Lengeh, Bushehr and Rudbar.

===After victory of Iranian Revolution===

After Ayatollah Khamenei became leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Yazdi served as the president of the Supreme Court. He remained in the post for many years before being replaced by Muhammad Hashemi Shahroudi.
Yazdi was a member of the Assembly of Experts and the Guardian Council. He served as the interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran.

This is some of the political career of Ayatollah Yazdi after The Islamic Revolution as follows:
*Management of Imam Khomeini&#x27;s Office in Qom
*Member of the dispute resolution council between Mohammad-Ali Rajai and Abolhassan Banisadr
*Member of the Assembly of Experts constitution in 1979
*Temporary Tehran&#x27;s Friday Prayer Imam, 1982 to late 1990s
*Chief Justice of Iran 1989 to 1999
*Member of the Assembly of Experts, 1991 to 2016
*Member of Iranian Parliament from 1980 to 1988 in Qom and Tehran
*Vice chairman of Iranian Parliament in the first and second periods
*Member of Guardian Council in the periods of the second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
*One of the founders and secretary of Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom

==Political views==

===United States===

In the run-up to the February 2016 elections, Yazdi opposed bilateral relations with the United States. In the popular election held in February 2016 for Assembly of Experts candidates, incumbent Chairman Yazdi was not among the 16 experts who received enough votes to represent Tehran in the Fifth Assembly of Experts.

Many western media outlets pointed to Yazdi&#x27;s exit from the Assembly when providing and emphasizing the gains that reformists made in the 2016 elections. In a speech congratulating those elected to the Fifth Assembly of Experts, Yazdi advocated for peaceful, moderate relations with other countries, but went on to warn about dealing with enemies and characterized America as &quot;The Great Satan&quot;. Two days later, Fars News Agency reported the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei lamented the Assembly&#x27;s loss of Yazdi as Chairman and warned of the risk that the West could influence or infiltrate Iran. As of 9 May 2016, Yazdi remained on the Guardian Council, which vets potential candidates for the Assembly of Experts. During Yazdi&#x27;s tenure on the Guardian Council, human-rights organizations have criticized the Guardian Council&#x27;s disqualification of reform candidates in the 2016 elections.

==Sanctions==
In February 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Yazdi for &quot;preventing free and fair elections in Iran.&quot;

==Work==
Ayatollah Yazdi authored several books in English and Persian such as, &quot;Your missing&quot;, &quot;Answers of Mardooq&#x27;s accusations&quot; and &quot;Imamah in Shia Islam&quot;.

==Death==
Yazdi died on 9 December 2020. He was buried in Qom later that day.

<text>BBC Knowledge was a British television channel which was owned by the BBC and was launched on 1 June 1999, broadcasting documentary, cultural and educational programmes. It was shut down on 2 March 2002, and was replaced by BBC Four.

==History==

===Launch===
The BBC had been wanting to expand into the digital television market for a number of years prior to BBC Knowledge&#x27;s launch. Originally this was by their association with Flextech, which spawned the UKTV network. Both companies had different ideas on how the new channels would be run: the BBC wanted the channels branded as BBC channels, but Flextech wanted the channels to contain advertising. The BBC refused, stating that no domestic BBC channel should carry advertising, and in the end a compromise was made. Two of the channels would launch as BBC channels, the soon to be BBC Choice and the then called BBC Learning, with the remainder of the channels being launched as the UKTV network, intended to be BBC in all but name. Prior to the launch, the channel changed name from BBC Learning to BBC Knowledge.

The channel launched on 1 June 1999, broadcasting for six hours each day. The new channel had plans to be a new, multimedia channel, operating across television, online and on interactive television, and showing educational and informative programming. The channel&#x27;s original schedule style was initially a &#x27;bright and breezy&#x27; approach to education, aimed at both adults and children, with viewers encouraged to get involved and contribute to the programming. Original programmes included a GCSE survival guide based upon the popular BBC series &quot;Bitesize&quot;, entitled &quot;Bitesize Etc&quot; and the technology series The Kit, a technology and computing programme aimed at getting viewers online and embracing digital.

===Relaunch===
A few years into the channel&#x27;s existence, it was becoming clear that the channel&#x27;s original format was not working in its aim of interacting with viewers and making learning fun. The channel was receiving consistently poor ratings, and the BBC decided to relaunch the channel. The relaunched channel was given a new visual identity, and from 17 November 2001 became 24-hour channel, caused by the move of BBC Knowledge from the SDN to the BBC multiplex on the DTT service. In addition to this, the format was changed to a serious, documentary channel with scheduling arranged into &#x27;zones&#x27; depending on topics.

===Closure===

However, the real reason for the shift in programming was because the incumbent government delayed approving new BBC digital plans. BBC Three and Four were planned to have launched in 2001 but because of the plans being delayed, instead the BBC decided to relaunch the two channels in the meantime with the new programming. It had been planned since October 2000 that Knowledge would be replaced with BBC Four. Eventually the new digital plans were approved. In February 2002 the hours were cut back for CBeebies to launch. BBC Knowledge was closed down in the final hours of 2 March 2002.

BBC Knowledge from mid-2001 was essentially a test platform for the style of the new channel.

==Visual identity==

The launch identity consisted of cartoon characters climbing &#x27;ladders of learning&#x27; between clouds against an orange background. Illustrator Michael Sheehy designed the idents. A white, BBC logo with &#x27;Knowledge&#x27; after it in capital letters was located at the bottom of the screen. The ident image would also be present in the background of the end promotions, channel menus advertising upcoming programmes, and in video links presented by members of the public. In addition to this, a DOG was used on the channel, located in the top left of the screen, which displayed the web address for the channel, linking in with the interactive learning element, however this was replaced with the BBC Knowledge logo before too long.

Later on, the idents changed to follow a strand layout, with different idents for each strand. These featured an object, before a fact about it related to the strand appears and ends on an image with the strand name shown clearly on screen, with a letter encircled at the centre of the screen. It is unclear whether these idents were replacements of the animated idents, or complementary to them, however it appears they complemented them, with these idents being used in the stranded sections, with the animated idents used for general interest programming.

Following the relaunch in 2001, all different idents were dropped in favour of a single ident, featuring numerous circles made out of different structures reflecting the new strands.

<doc id="1211125" wikidata="Q517749" url="?curid=1211125" title="André Chapelon">
<text>André Chapelon (26 October 1892 – 22 July 1978) was a French mechanical engineer and designer of advanced steam locomotives. A graduate engineer of Ecole Centrale Paris, he was one of very few locomotive designers who brought a rigorous scientific method to their design, and he sought to apply up-to-date theories and knowledge in subjects such as thermodynamics, and gas and fluid flow. Chapelon&#x27;s work was an early example of what would later be called modern steam, and influenced the work of many later designers of those locomotives, such as Livio Dante Porta.

==Life and career==
André Xavier Chapelon was born in Saint-Paul-en-Cornillon, Loire, France on 26 October 1892. According to family relatives, his great-grandfather James Jackson immigrated to France from England in 1812, one of many who came to France in the 19th century to teach steel production methods. He achieved a distinction in mathematics and science, and served as an artillery officer during World War I before returning to the École centrale Paris in 1919, from which he graduated as Ingénieur des Arts et Manufactures in 1921. He joined the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) as a probationer in the Rolling Stock and Motive Power section at Lyon-Mouche depot. However, foreseeing poor prospects, he left in 1924 and joined the Société Industrielle des Telephones, soon becoming as assistant manager. In 1925, he joined the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans (PO) and, along with Finnish Engineer Kyösti Kylälä, jointly designed the Kylchap exhaust system. While his principles met with scepticism, No. 3566, the first locomotive rebuilt to Chapelon&#x27;s design, was an outstanding success, and from 1929 to 1936 several other locomotives were rebuilt to Chapelon&#x27;s designs.

In 1934, Chapelon was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour and awarded both the Plumey Prize of the Académie des Sciences and the Gold Medal of the Société d&#x27;Encouragement pour l&#x27;Industrie Nationale. From 1938 he published the book for which he is most noted &quot;La locomotive à vapeur&quot;.

On 13 September 1971 Chapelon was made Vice-President of the Stephenson Locomotive Society in a ceremony in Paris.

==Chapelon&#x27;s methods==
He tested his experimental designs thoroughly to understand how they actually behaved, using the most accurate and complete testing and sensing equipment available, such as high-speed stroboscopic photography to watch steam flow.

Before Chapelon, few engineers and designers tried to understand why a certain design worked better than another—they merely worked by trial and error, trying to replicate the attributes of previous locomotives by rule of thumb, by guesswork, and from empirical theories and design rules that had rarely been given adequate testing.

===Efficiency===
Efficiency was one of Chapelon&#x27;s primary concerns in design. Some of his locomotives exceeded 12% efficiency, which for a steam locomotive was exceptional. With greater efficiency, Chapelon could achieve greater power in a smaller locomotive that burned less coal, rather than simply enlarging a locomotive for more power.

===Compounding and steam flow===
He was a major proponent of the compound locomotive, and from 1929 on he rebuilt many de Glehn compounds, designed by Alfred de Glehn, with his system of compounding. His other major work included optimising the steam circuit, including improving the steam flow by widening steam passages and paths, improving the flow through valve gear, and improved exhaust systems such as his Kylchap exhaust.

===Wheel and rail===
Chapelon realised that in order to produce an efficient, powerful locomotive, every aspect of it had to be improved and dealt with scientifically. He studied locomotive behaviour at speed and the riding properties of the steel wheel on steel rail; his knowledge was put to use much later on the French TGV high speed trains.

==Problems==
Despite his abilities and track record, he was never presented the opportunity to design a class of entirely-new locomotives that were produced in any numbers. He was continually stymied by railway management and politicians, and often his superbly performing locomotives were treated as embarrassments by his superiors, because they showed up the poor performance of the officially-approved locomotives.

==Chapelon&#x27;s legacy==
Chapelon&#x27;s work lived on in the work of his friend and protégé Livio Dante Porta of Argentina, and others, and he was accorded the rare honour for a foreign railwayman of having a British Rail Class 86 electric locomotive named for him.

Although many of Chapelon&#x27;s contemporaries did not adopt his methods, a few did. One notable such designer was Nigel Gresley of the British London and North Eastern Railway, who experimentally used Chapelon&#x27;s Kylchap exhaust system on a small number of LNER Class A4 locomotives, including the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard, which set what most historians accept as the world record for speed for steam locomotives in 1938.

Czech locomotive designers at the Škoda Works watched Chapelon&#x27;s work, especially when construction commenced on ČSD class 476.0 locomotive, the last compound locomotive of Czech origin. They consulted Chapelon during construction, and he visited Czechoslovakia.

Chapelon published numerous works on steam locomotive design, although only his most famous work (&quot;La locomotive a vapeur&quot;, described above) has been translated into English.

==Chapelon&#x27;s locomotives==
===French locomotives===
The first locomotive rebuilt to incorporate Chapelon&#x27;s work was PO 4-6-2 3566, which was released from Tours works in November 1929. As a result of this, three further series of Pacifics were similarly modified.

This was followed by a more comprehensive rebuild of Pacific 4521 as a 4-8-0, which was completed in August 1932. The success of that work led to eleven more rebuilds to locomotives numbered 4701-4712 (later 240 701 - 240 712). Those locomotives produced almost 40 indicated horsepower (ihp) continuous per metric ton locomotive weight, which probably still is a world record.

In 1936, Chapelon began the rebuild of a PO 6000 class 2-10-0 as a 2-12-0, with two high-pressure cylinders between the 2nd and 3rd coupled axles mounted behind four low-pressure cylinders. That unusual cylinder arrangement was required due to the loading gauge being too narrow to accommodate two low-pressure cylinders with the required volume to fully expand the low-pressure steam. There was also an additional level of &quot;superheat&quot; between the high- and low-pressure cylinders, allowing the loco to achieve a tractive effort of 83700 lb.

The 242 A 1 was perhaps the pinnacle of Chapelon&#x27;s development of the steam locomotive. The 4-8-4 was a rebuild of Etat 4-8-2 241.101, which retained the 3-cylinder layout, changed it into a 3-cylinder compound system, and introduced more of Chapelon&#x27;s improvements, including a triple Kylchap exhaust, double high-pressure valves and Willoteaux valves on the low-pressure cylinders. Completed in 1946, and with a continuous power output of 5500 ihp, the locomotive was rather more powerful than contemporary French electric locomotives, resulting in a hasty redesign of subsequent electric locos, increasing their power by another . However, the locomotive was scrapped in 1960.

The SNCF 240P class is considered by some to be among Chapelon&#x27;s best designs, and was the most thermally-efficient locomotive in the world at its time. According to some, it was equal in efficiency to early diesel locomotives of its time.

===Exported locomotives===
The only locomotives Chapelon designed for use outside France were some metre gauge 2-8-4 and 4-8-4 locomotives for GELSA (Groupement d&#x27;Exportation de Locomotives S.A.) for export to Brazil. They were highly advanced locomotives with many modern American appliances, as well as Chapelon&#x27;s innovations. He was a great admirer of American industrial capacities and the resulting high quality of its engineering, even though his work tended to be ignored in the USA. One standard Gauge 4-4-2 was owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Numbered 2512 which gained a Nickname De Glehn.

===Proposed Designs===
Chapelon had several designs of standardised locomotive on the drawing board, starting with his time at P.O.Midi. Entirely new designs were drawn following his exposure to American ideas, with a visit to the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) works in Schenectady, New York, and after experience with the operating characteristics of 242A1 became known. They were planned to be 3-cylinder Sauvage compound locomotives, with a large, 6m2 (65 sq. ft) grate area, for duties that required high horsepower, and were to be complemented by 2-cylinder simple expansion 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 designs for less-demanding duties.

The 152 (2-10-4) locomotive design had two frames partially constructed, before the decision was made to electrify the SNCF and phase out steam. As a result, the frames were scrapped before completion.

<doc id="1211139" wikidata="Q543512" url="?curid=1211139" title="Burrata">
<text>Burrata () is an Italian cow&#x27;s milk (occasionally buffalo milk) cheese made from mozzarella and cream. The outer casing is solid cheese, while the inside contains and clotted cream, giving it an unusual, soft texture. It is a speciality of the Puglia region of southern Italy.

== History ==

Burrata is a dairy product of Murgia, in Puglia in southern Italy. It is produced from cow&#x27;s milk, rennet, and cream, and may have origins dating back to about 1900, produced at the Bianchino brothers&#x27; (Lorenzo and Vincenzo) farm in the town of Andria. More recent records have shown that Lorenzo Bianchino, of the Piana Padura farm, first developed the product in 1956.

In November 2016, became a protected geographical indication (PGI) product. To qualify as burrata di Andria all operations, from the processing of the raw materials up to the production of the finished product, must take place in the defined geographical area of the region of Puglia.

Established as an artisanal cheese, burrata maintained its premium-product status even after it began to be made commercially in factories throughout Puglia.

==Production==

Burrata starts out much like mozzarella and many other cheeses, with rennet used to curdle the warm milk. Unlike other cheeses, however, the fresh mozzarella curds are plunged into hot whey or lightly salted water, kneaded, and pulled to develop stretchy strings (), then shaped.

When making burrata, the still-hot cheese is formed into a pouch, which is then filled with the scraps of leftover mozzarella and topped off with fresh cream before closing. The finished burrata is traditionally wrapped in the leaves of asphodel, tied to form a brioche-like topknot, and moistened with whey.

As burrata does not keep well, even when refrigerated, it is advisable to use it promptly while it is still fresh.

<doc id="1211143" wikidata="Q740162" url="?curid=1211143" title="Petrushka (ballet)">
<text>Petrushka (; ) is a ballet by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1911 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine and stage designs and costumes by Alexandre Benois, who assisted Stravinsky with the libretto. The ballet premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 June 1911 with Vaslav Nijinsky as Petrushka, Tamara Karsavina as the lead ballerina, Alexander Orlov as the Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti the charlatan.

&quot;Petrushka&quot; tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets. The three are brought to life by the Charlatan during the 1830 Shrovetide Fair (&quot;Maslenitsa&quot;) in Saint Petersburg. Petrushka is in love with the Ballerina, but she rejects him as she prefers the Moor. Petrushka is angry and hurt, and curses the Charlatan for bringing him into the world with only pain and suffering in his miserable life. Because of his anger, he challenges the Moor as a result. The Moor, who is both bigger and stronger than Petrushka, kills him with his sword (scimitar). The crowd watching is horrified, and the Charlatan is called to the scene as well as a police officer. The Charlatan reminds everyone that Petrushka is nothing but a puppet made of straw and cloth, and that he has no real emotion nor &#x27;life&#x27;. As the crowd disperses, the Charlatan is left alone on the stage. At that moment, Petrushka&#x27;s ghost rises above the puppet theatre as night falls. He shakes his fist and thumbs his nose at the Charlatan, making him flee, terrified. Petrushka then collapses in a second death.

&quot;Petrushka&quot; brings music, dance, and design together in a unified whole. It is one of the most popular of the Ballets Russes productions. It is usually performed today using the original designs and choreography. Grace Robert wrote in 1946, &quot;Although more than thirty years have elapsed since &quot;Petrushka&quot; was first performed, its position as one of the greatest ballets remains unassailed. Its perfect fusion of music, choreography, and décor and its themethe timeless tragedy of the human spiritunite to make its appeal universal&quot;.

==Russian puppets==

Petrushka is a puppet. He is a character known across Europe under different names: Punch in England, Polichinelle in France, Pulcinella in Italy, Kasperle in Germany, and Petrushka in Russia. Whatever his name, he is a trickster, a rebel, and a wife beater. He enforces moral justice with a wooden club, speaks in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, and argues with the devil. His plays are formulaic and subversive. They repeat key scenes from one play to another. The plays usually end with a dog, a policeman, or the devil dragging him away.

Empress Anna Ivanovna brought marionettes to Russia in the 18th century. These puppets were an amusement for the aristocracy. Rod puppets were an Asian import. They performed religious plays, mostly at Christmas. Petrushka, however, was a hand puppet. He was loved by the common people. He performed in street theatres and other open air venues in small portable booths or behind screens that could be easily assembled and just as easily disassembled. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet authorities forced Petrushka indoors. They wanted to be better able to monitor his subversiveness.

==Composition==

The gestation of &quot;Petrushka&quot; was not a straightforward matter. While completing &quot;The Firebird&quot; during the spring of 1910, Stravinsky had a &quot;vision&quot; of a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of &quot;The Rite of Spring.&quot; Immediately following the stunning success of &quot;The Firebird&quot; in June 1910, Diaghilev approached Stravinsky about a new ballet; the composer proposed the &quot;Rite&quot; theme. Diaghilev accepted in principle and suggested that the premiere might take place during the Paris season of the Ballets Russes during the spring of 1912.

At the end of September 1910, Diaghilev went to visit Stravinsky in Clarens, Switzerland, where he was living at the time. Expecting to discuss the new ballet, Diaghilev was astonished to find Stravinsky hard at work on a totally different project. Stravinsky, it seems, had had another vision: &quot;I saw a man in evening dress, with long hair, the musician or poet of the romantic tradition. He placed several heteroclite objects on the keyboard and rolled them up and down. At this the orchestra exploded with the most vehement protestations – hammer blows, in fact …&quot;

Later, Stravinsky wrote: &quot;[i]n composing the music, I had in my mind a distinct picture of a puppet, suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggios. The orchestra in turn retaliates with menacing trumpet blasts.&quot; Although Stravinsky had conceived the music as a pure concert work—a &quot;Konzertstück&quot;, Diaghilev immediately realized its theatrical potential. The notion of a puppet put Diaghilev in mind of Petrushka, the Russian version of Punch and Judy puppetry that had formed a traditional part of the pre-Lenten Carnival festivities in 1830s St. Petersburg.

Stravinsky composed the music during the winter of 1910–11 for Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. It was premièred in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 June 1911 the Orchestre Colonne under conductor Pierre Monteux, with choreography by Michel Fokine and sets by Alexandre Benois. The title role was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky. The work is characterized by the so-called Petrushka chord (consisting of C major and F major triads played together), a bitonality device heralding the appearance of the main character.

==Libretto and story==

While the original idea was Stravinsky&#x27;s, Alexandre Benois provided the ethnographic details of the Shrovetide Fair and the traditions of the Russian puppet theater. And although &quot;Petrushka&quot; is frequently cited as an example of the complete integration of libretto, music, choreography, and scenic design, Stravinsky had composed significant portions of the music (chiefly the second tableau) before Benois became involved with the project.
=== First tableau: &quot;The Shrovetide Fair&quot; ===
&quot;Petrushka&quot; begins with a festive orchestral introduction based, in part, on historical Russian street-hawkers&#x27; cries. The curtain rises to reveal St. Petersburg&#x27;s Admiralty Square during the 1830s. The stage set (also by Benois) depicts several hucksters&#x27; booths, a ferris-wheel, a carousel, and (upstage center) a puppet theater. A crowd has gathered for the Shrovetide Fair (known as &quot;Maslenitsa&quot;), the carnival (analogous to Mardi Gras) preceding Lent.

In Fokine&#x27;s original choreography, a group of Drunken Revelers emerges from the crowd, dancing to Stravinsky&#x27;s adaptation of the folk-tune &quot;Song of the Volochobniki&quot; (&quot;Dalalin&#x27; Dalalin&#x27;&quot; from Rimsky-Korsakov Op. 24 No. 47).

Suddenly, the festive music is interrupted by strident brass announcing the appearance of the Master of Ceremonies on the balcony of his booth. The equivalent of a carnival &quot;barker&quot;, he boasts of the attractions to be seen within. 

The squeaks of a street-organ are heard (clarinets and flutes) as an Organ-Grinder and Dancing Girl emerge from the crowd, which at first pays little attention as the barker continues to shout. The Dancer moves downstage and begins to dance to another Russian folk-song, &quot;Toward Evening, in Rainy Autumn&quot;, while playing the triangle.

At the other end of the stage, a second Dancing Girl appears, accompanied by a music box (suggested in the orchestra by the celesta). The two Dancing Girls compete for the crowd&#x27;s attention to the strains of a ribald French music-hall song about a woman with a wooden leg: &quot;Une Jambe de bois&quot;. Both tunes are repeated.

The Drunken Revelers return (again to the &quot;Song of the Volochobniki&quot;) interrupted several times by the Barker&#x27;s boasts. The street-hawkers&#x27; cries of the very opening are heard once more.

Suddenly, two drummers summon the crowd to the puppet theater with deafening drumrolls. The Magician (sometimes called the &quot;Charlatan&quot;) appears to mystical groans from the bassoon and contrabassoon. When he has everyone&#x27;s attention, he produces a flute and begins to play a long, improvisatory melody. The curtain of the puppet theater rises to reveal three puppets hanging on the wall: the Moor, the Ballerina, and Petrushka. When the Magician touches them with his flute (to chirps in the orchestra), they seem to awaken.

The astonished crowd watches as, with a wave of the Magician&#x27;s hand, the three puppets begin a vigorous Russian Dance (based on two more Russian folk-tunes: &quot;A Linden Tree Is in the Field&quot; and &quot;Song for St. John&#x27;s Eve&quot;).

In Fokine&#x27;s choreography, they first begin to move their feet (while still hanging on the wall), then burst forth from the puppet theater into the midst of the crowd. The Moor (resplendent in turban and exaggerated pantaloons) is swashbuckling. The Ballerina dances perpetually &quot;en pointe&quot;. Petrushka, on the other hand, is wooden and awkward. It becomes apparent Petrushka loves the Ballerina; but she has eyes only for the Moor. The Magician calls the dance to a halt; the curtain falls rapidly.

=== Second tableau: &quot;Petrushka&#x27;s Room&quot; ===
Although Petrushka&#x27;s room is inside the puppet theater, the Benois design is fantastical, portraying the night sky with stars and a half-moon; abstract icebergs (or snow-capped mountains), and a prominent portrait of the Magician.

Drumrolls announce the beginning of the second tableau. Without an Introduction, the music begins menacingly. &quot;A foot kicks him onstage; Petrushka falls...&quot;

As Petrushka gradually pulls himself together, we hear a strange arpeggio in the clarinets: this is the famous &quot;Petrushka chord&quot; (consisting of juxtaposed triads of C major and F major). Petrushka gets to his feet (although shakily) to the accompaniment of waves of arpeggios from the piano (revealing the music&#x27;s origins in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Konzertstück&quot;). The &quot;Petrushka Chord&quot; returns, now violently scored for trumpets, marked in the score &quot;Petrushka&#x27;s Curses&quot;, directed at the portrait of the Magician.

The music turns lyrical as Petrushka falls to his knees and mimes (in turn) his self-pity, love for the Ballerina, and hatred of the Magician.

The Ballerina (still &quot;en pointe&quot;) sneaks into Petrushka&#x27;s room, at first unnoticed. As soon as Petrushka sees her, he begins a manic, athletic display of leaps and frantic gestures (although he was barely able to stand before she arrived). Frightened by his exuberance, the Ballerina flees. Petrushka falls to the floor to the mocking of the clarinets.

Another passage of arpeggios for piano grows into a second round of curses directed at the Magician, again represented musically by the &quot;Petrushka Chord&quot;, this time scored for full orchestra.

For just a moment, Petrushka peers out of his room at the crowd assembled in Admiralty Square (Stravinsky provides a brief reference to the &quot;crowd music&quot; of the first tableau). Then, Petrushka collapses as we hear a taunting reprise of the clarinets playing the &quot;Petrushka Chord&quot;, followed by an odd trumpet call signalling &quot;blackout, curtain.&quot;

=== Third tableau: &quot;The Moor&#x27;s Room&quot; ===
As before, drumrolls link the third tableau to its predecessor (in the 1911 score, Stravinsky directs that this drumroll should be omitted in concert performance). In sharp contrast to the darkness of Petrushka&#x27;s Cell, the brilliant colors of the Benois design for the Moor&#x27;s Room evoke a romanticized desert: palm trees, exotic flowers, sand.

In Fokine&#x27;s choreography, the Moor reclines on a divan playing with a coconut. He then jumps to his feet and attempts to cut it with his scimitar. When he fails he believes that the coconut must be a god and proceeds to pray to it.

The Charlatan places the Ballerina in the Moor&#x27;s room. The Ballerina is attracted to the Moor&#x27;s handsome appearance. She plays a saucy tune on a toy trumpet (represented by a cornet in the original 1911 orchestration) and then dances with the Moor in a waltz (the themes taken from Joseph Lanner&#x27;s Op. 165 No. 1 and Op. 200 No. 1).

Petrushka finally breaks free from his cell; he interrupts the seduction of the Ballerina. Petrushka attacks the Moor but soon realizes he is too small and weak. The Moor beats Petrushka. The ballerina faints. The clown-puppet flees for his life, with the Moor chasing him, and escapes from the room.

=== Fourth tableau: &quot;The Shrovetide Fair (Toward Evening)&quot; ===
The fourth and final scene returns to the carnival. Some time has passed; it is now early evening. The orchestra introduces a chain of colourful dances as a series of apparently unrelated characters come and go about the stage as snow begins to fall. The first and most prominent is the Wet-Nurses&#x27; Dance, performed to the tune of the folk song &quot;Down the Petersky Road&quot;. Then comes a peasant with his dancing bear, followed in turn by a group of a gypsies, coachmen and grooms and masqueraders.

As the merrymaking reaches its peak, a cry is heard from the puppet-theater. Petrushka suddenly runs across the scene, followed by the Moor in hot pursuit brandishing his sword, and the terrified Ballerina chasing after the Moor, fearful of what he might do. The crowd is horrified when the Moor catches up with Petrushka and slays him with a single stroke of his blade.

The police question the Charlatan. The Charlatan seeks to restore calm by holding the &quot;corpse&quot; above his head and shaking it to remind everyone that Petrushka is but a puppet.

As night falls and the crowd disperses, the Charlatan leaves, carrying Petrushka&#x27;s limp body. All of a sudden, Petrushka&#x27;s ghost appears on the roof of the little theatre, his cry now in the form of angry defiance. Petrushka&#x27;s spirit thumbs its nose at his tormentor from beyond the wood and straw of his carcass.

Now completely alone, the Charlatan is terrified to see the leering ghost of Petrushka. He runs away while allowing himself a single frightened glance over his shoulder. The scene is hushed, leaving the audience to wonder who is &quot;real&quot; and who is not.

==Other versions==
During rehearsals for the 1911 premiere, Stravinsky and other pianists including Russian composer Nikolai Tcherepnin used a piano four-hand version of the score. This has never been published, although Paul Jacobs and Ursula Oppens, among other pianists, have played it in concert.

In 1921, Stravinsky created a virtuosic and celebrated piano arrangement for Arthur Rubinstein, &quot;Trois mouvements de Petrouchka&quot;, which the composer admitted he could not play himself, for want of adequate left-hand technique.

Herbert Stothart, who composed the score for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, was visited by Stravinsky at MGM in 1936. Stravinsky gave Stothart a personal, signed copy of &quot;Petrushka&quot;. As the main characters in the film run through the Deadly Poppy Field, the opening to the fourth tableau can be heard briefly.

In 1946, he thinned the ballet&#x27;s scoring, in part because the original was not covered everywhere by copyright. The rapid continuous timpani and snare-drum notes that link each scene, optional in 1911, are compulsory in this version, which was published in 1947. The Ballerina&#x27;s tune is assigned to a trumpet in 1946 in place of a cornet, and the 1946 version provides an optional (&quot;fortississimo&quot;) near the &quot;piano&quot; conclusion. Stravinsky also removed some difficult metric modulations in the first tableau.

Separately Stravinsky created a suite for concert performance, an almost complete version of the ballet but cutting the last three sections.

In 1956, an animated version of the ballet appeared as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sol Hurok Music Hour&quot;. It was personally conducted by Stravinsky himself and was the first such collaboration. Directed by animator John David Wilson with Fine Arts Films, it has been noted as the first animated special ever to air on television.

Frank Zappa&#x27;s 1960&#x27;s iteration of his band the Mothers of Invention, would frequently quote &quot;Petrushka&quot; either as a standalone performance or during their longer performances of the song King Kong. 

In 1968, Maddalena Fagandini directed a stop motion version of &quot;Petrushka&quot;, with animation by Bura and Hardwick, which was broadcast by the BBC.

Basil Twist debuted his puppetry version of &quot;Petrushka&quot; at Lincoln Center in 2001; it was performed as well at New York City Center&#x27;s 2009 Fall for Dance Festival.

A full transcription of the 1911 version for symphonic wind ensemble in the original key was made by Don Patterson.

Themes from &quot;Petrushka&quot; are played on banjo in the track &quot;Russian Folk Themes and Yodel&quot; on Pete Seeger&#x27;s album Goofing-Off Suite, released in 1955 on Folkways Records.

In the 2022 film &quot;Goodbye, Petrushka&quot;, Petrushka is a major plot element.

<doc id="1211148" wikidata="Q6920858" url="?curid=1211148" title="Mount Gambier Prison">
<text>Mount Gambier Prison is an Australian prison located in Moorak immediately south of Mount Gambier. It is managed and operated by G4S.

==Prison life==
The prison accommodates medium and low security male sentenced and remand prisoners. Short-term high security male and female prisoners can also be accommodated when required. Accommodation includes: a traditional cell block arrangement, shared living cottages, semi-independent living cottages, an induction area that houses new prisoners, and a small allocation of high-security cells.

Mount Gambier Prison provides a full range of prisoner services, including all medical, education, facilities management, equipment and grounds preventative maintenance services ‘in house’, using locally employed staff and sub-contractors. Consistent with other prisons in South Australia, prisoners are placed on incentive-based regimes that provide varying levels of privileges based on behaviour.

Prisoners are engaged in a range of work programs including grounds and building maintenance, cleaning, laundry and kitchen work. The prison also has a large timber furniture manufacturing workshop that produces bedroom and living room furniture for dispatch directly to retail outlets in South Australia.

Education and program activities focus on numeracy and literacy skills and cognitive skills programs are aimed at high risk offenders. In 1998, prisoners under the instructions of a local builder constructed an education centre within the prison. The work was also attached to a vocational course. This resulted in prisoners learning new skills and obtaining TAFE certificates to assist them upon their release.

A strong partnership exists between Lifeline South East and the prison. This relationship began in mid-1995 with Lifeline&#x27;s involvement in suicide awareness training for new prison staff. In 2010, the prisoner listener program, which aims to reduce suicides at the prison, gained a national award.

==Improvements==
In March 2009, an expansion of the prison was announced. With a project budget of $22.9m, it will be the first South Australian prison to employ the cheaper and faster modular construction method using shipping containers. The cell block is constructed as a single storey facility designed around two wings of 54 beds (total of 108 beds) with a central officers station to supervise both wings. Each wing has a central external exercise yard. A new kitchen will also be built and the prison perimeter will be extended.

* During 2003-2004, work was conducted in the cells to eliminate hanging points and the fire safety systems in the cell block, the cottages and the operations building were upgraded.
*In 2005, a new $950,000 state-of-the art Control Room was officially commissioned.
*In 2007, to address pressure on the South Australian Custodial Correctional system, the prisons capacity increased from 110 to 139 beds. In June 2012, the capacity of the prison was 172.
* The 2017 state budget included provision to spend on adding 160 beds to Mount Gambier Prison.
* By the end of 2018, it could hold 490 inmates.

==Incidents==
In April 2001, a single prisoner became the first to escape the facility by climbing two razor-wire-topped fences. This is the only escape from within the confines of the prison as of June 2022. 

In July 2004, the South Australian Coroner was critical of cell design, Group 4 and Department of Correctional Services staff following the death of a prisoner.

In March 2009, Chief executive of the Department of Correctional Services Peter Severin said that since the Mount Gambier Prison was opened in [1995], it has been a stable facility with &quot;very few&quot; incidents.

<doc id="1211153" wikidata="Q724698" url="?curid=1211153" title="Ultra (Depeche Mode album)">
<text>Ultra is the ninth studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 14 April 1997 by Mute Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album following the departure of Alan Wilder, and the first album which featured as a trio. Wilder&#x27;s departure and lead singer Dave Gahan&#x27;s drug problems, which culminated in a near-fatal overdose, had caused speculation that Depeche Mode was finished. 

&quot;Ultra&quot; was the first album the band recorded as a trio since &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; (1982); it was also their first where the band members were not involved with production, with these duties being handled by Tim Simenon of Bomb the Bass fame. Though not directly supported by a full-length tour, it was promoted via a brief series of concerts promoted as Ultra Parties.

The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By April 2006, it had sold 584,000 copies in the United States. In 1999, Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 50 on his list of the &quot;Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot;. That same year, the annual Ultra Music Festival in Miami was named after the album by its co-founder Russell Faibisch, and acknowledging its influence on the Polish rock scene, &quot;Tylko Rock&quot; ranked it at number 71 on its list of the &quot;100 Albums That Shook Polish Rock&quot;.

The album was preceded by the singles &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot;, released on 3 February and &quot;It&#x27;s No Good&quot; which was released on 31 March. It was followed by the singles &quot;Home&quot;, released on 16 June and &quot;Useless&quot;, released on 20 October.

==Background and composition==
Lyrically, much of the album was inspired by the turmoil the band had faced throughout the 1990s. Martin Gore said that the opening track &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; is about realising that you do not have to fit someone else&#x27;s view of the world. The demo version is similar in feel to the final version, although it was recreated from scratch. The drum pattern was cut up from a loop and re-sequenced, as Gore did not want to use an unedited drum loop, but also felt that loops can provide an &quot;immediate atmosphere&quot;.

Musically, the band explored many sounds within the realms of alternative rock but with larger electronic and trip-hop influences. The band also felt that they wanted to do something different since Alan Wilder had left the band. Tim Simenon served as the album&#x27;s sole producer, who had previously created two remixes for the limited 12&quot; release of the live version of &quot;Everything Counts&quot; with Mark Saunders. He had also been a large fan of the band&#x27;s music as far back as their appearance on &quot;Some Bizzare Album&quot; in 1981 with the track &quot;Photographic&quot;. As Gore and Gahan were impressed with Gavin Friday&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Shag Tobacco&quot;, which he had produced, Daniel Miller arranged for him to meet with the band.

&quot;Sister of Night&quot;, &quot;Useless&quot; and &quot;Insight&quot; were the first demos to have been written. The band played these demos to Simenon when they met, and despite their simplicity he was impressed. Upon hearing the demo of &quot;It&#x27;s No Good&quot;, he considered it to be a classic Depeche Mode song. While the project started out as a small set of songs, it eventually evolved into a full album.

Gahan continued to struggle with his heroin addiction during the early months of the album&#x27;s production. He rarely turned up to scheduled sessions, and when he did, it would take weeks to get any vocals recorded; one six-week session at Electric Lady in New York produced just one usable vocal (for &quot;Sister of Night&quot;), and even that was pieced together from multiple takes. Gore was forced to contemplate breaking the band up and considered releasing the songs he had written as a solo album. In mid-1996, after his near-fatal overdose, Gahan entered a court-ordered drug rehabilitation program to battle his addiction to cocaine and heroin. Recording sessions continued after he came out of rehab; according to Simenon, he sang &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; as if nothing had happened.

Wilder himself commented on the album discussing his feelings towards his departure:
==2007 re-release==
On 2 October 2007 (3 October in North America), &quot;Ultra&quot; was re-released as a two-disc set, along with &quot;Exciter&quot;, completing the Depeche Mode collector&#x27;s edition catalog. The first disc is a remastered version of the original album, on a SACD/CD hybrid (except in the United States, where it is a CD only). The second disc is a DVD which features the album in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo. The B-sides from the album&#x27;s singles can be listened to as well, including the standalone single &quot;Only When I Lose Myself&quot; and its B-sides. 

Like the other albums, there is a documentary on the making of &quot;Ultra&quot; titled &quot;Depeche Mode 95–98 (Oh Well, That&#x27;s the End of the Band...)&quot;, the subtitle of which comes from Gore&#x27;s thoughts about Wilder&#x27;s departure. The documentary begins with discussion from all parties of Wilder&#x27;s departure before moving on to early album sessions despite Dave Gahan&#x27;s drug issues present. Eventually, it moves on to Gahan&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; and rehab. The documentary then covers the recording of &quot;Ultra&quot; and ends with a discussion on &quot;The Singles 86&gt;98&quot; and its corresponding singles tour. The whole band is interviewed, along with Alan Wilder, Daniel Miller, producer Tim Simenon, Mute executives, touring keyboardist Peter Gordeno, touring drummer Christian Eigner, Anton Corbijn and others. The remastered version of the album was released on vinyl 30 March 2007 in Germany and 1 October 2007 internationally.

==Critical reception==
Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated the album &quot;ranks with their best work... this veteran British combo has made a disc that should please their millions of followers and provide a few guilty pleasures for the rest of us.&quot; Jim Farber in his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Ultra&quot;, their first work in four years, combines up-to-the-second synth effects (courtesy of producer Tim &#x27;Bomb the Bass&#x27; Simenon) with rippling melodies—all supported by the grim sonic architecture that long ago made DM the darlings of many a sour teen. Imposing spires of synths, industrial rivets of percussion, churchy organs, and grave vocals erect an edifice of reverent dread.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan deemed &quot;Ultra&quot; &quot;dark even by [Depeche Mode&#x27;s] standards&quot;, and on its songs, remarked that &quot;anyone doubting the potency of pop music should hear these, then pretend they&#x27;re unshaken.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Elysa Gardner observed a lack of &quot;snappy singles&quot; on &quot;Ultra&quot; but concluded that the album&#x27;s &quot;moody, pulsating ballads&quot; are &quot;ideal vehicles for Gahan&#x27;s brooding baritone and for the band&#x27;s ever-increasing sense of tender intuition.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Sara Scribner was less enthusiastic, finding that Depeche Mode had not progressed musically on &quot;Ultra&quot; apart from incorporating &quot;Simenon&#x27;s emotive, multilayered, high-tech sound, which would be far better suited for a subtler band but tends to wash out any hooks on this gloom-and-doom-y album.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; James Oldham observed, &quot;This album is at least partly the product of one of the most harrowing rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll sagas in recent memory. It&#x27;s the tale of an unassuming quartet transformed into a colossal financial machine designed to bring gravitas to the masses: four cherubs from Basildon who were lauded as deities in America—only to discover they couldn&#x27;t handle it... There is no dramatic reinvention, and as such we&#x27;re left with an album that&#x27;s every bit as flawed as its predecessors.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett stated that &quot;Depeche delivered a strong album as a rejuvenated band&quot; with &quot;Ultra&quot;, giving particular praise to Gahan&#x27;s &quot;new control and projection&quot; as a vocalist. Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; in 2022, Raggett described the album as &quot;a crucial bridge between the increasing ambition of their early years and the easy confidence of their later ones.&quot;

<text>Ardent Studios is an American recording studio located in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. The studio was founded in the late 1950s by John King, Fred Smith, and John Fry. Over time, it has become a commercially successful recording studio.

== History ==
Ardent Studios was founded by John Fry, John King, and Fred Smith, in 1959. Initially, it was a studio in John Fry&#x27;s family garage, where he recorded his first 45s for the Ardent Records label. Equipment in the studio included an Altec tube mixing console, Ampex 2-track tape recorder, a Pultec equalizer, and Neumann microphones.

In 1966, the studio moved to a commercial location shared with a bookshop. Tom Dowd was consulting with Auditronics on an early multitrack console for nearby Stax Records, and Fry ordered the same input modules for his second mixing board. When the studio upgraded to a Scully 4-track tape recorder, Ardent became the first 4-track studio in Memphis. It was also the first studio in the area to use EMT plate reverbs.

Looking towards the future, on October 25th, 1968, Fry Acquired the 2000 Madison parcel of land and broke ground on the future home of Ardent Studios, marking the beginning of a new chapter in its evolution.

On Thanksgiving weekend, 1971, Ardent Studios fully moved to its current location on Madison Avenue, consisting of two studios, A and B.

In 1980, Ardent expanded once more, Adding studio C.

In 2022-24, Ardent underwent a large-scale renovation in all of its control rooms and common areas, keeping the live rooms original and intact.

Ardent currently has four studios and one mastering vinyl mastering suite.

Studio A: houses a 72 Channel Neve 88RS.

Studio B: SSL 9080 J series

Studio C:72 Channel Custom Wunder Console with 1073 type modules.

Studio D: Neve 8424

Mastering Neumann VMS70 lathe.

All rooms have Pro Tools HD and Studer A800 and 827 Multitracks.

The studio is managed by Jody Stephens, the drummer for Big Star, an early Ardent group whose first two albums appeared on the Ardent Records label in the early 1970s. All three Big Star albums were in Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The song “In The Street” from their first album became the theme for “That 70s Show.”

In the 2000s, younger artists such as The White Stripes, 3 Doors Down, Cat Power, North Mississippi Allstars, The Raconteurs, Low Cut Connie, and Guy Sebastian recorded at Ardent. The soundtracks for Hustle and Flow and Black Snake Moan were also produced at Ardent.

As of February 2024, there are four studios available, each corresponding to the first four letters of alphabet and differing in and musical gear, mixing and recording capacities.

== Notable mentions ==
Ardent Studio recorded Sam &amp; Dave, Led Zeppelin, Isaac Hayes, Leon Russell, and the Staples Singers, and in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s recorded James Taylor along with ZZ Top, The Tragically Hip, George Thorogood, The Allman Brothers, Bob Dylan, R.E.M., Joe Walsh, and Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan.

Ardent became home to young producers and engineers such as Jim Dickinson, Terry Manning, Joe Hardy, John Hampton, Paul Ebersold, and later Skidd Mills, Jeff Powell, Brad Blackwood, Pete Mathews, and Jason Latshaw.

The studio also helped record soundtracks for &quot;Hustle and Flow&quot; and &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;.

<text>The Commonwealth Building is a 14-story, commercial office tower in Portland, Oregon, United States. Located at 421 SW 6th Avenue between Washington and Harvey Milk Streets, it was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi and built between 1944 and 1948. The building was originally known as the Equitable Building and is noted as one of the first glass box towers ever built, pioneering many modern features and predating the more famous Lever House in New York City.

==History==

Construction on the building began in 1944, with it opening in 1948 as the Equitable Building. The building, which was built as the headquarters in Portland of the Equitable Savings and Loan Association, was originally intended to be 12 stories high but was later expanded to 14. It was the first tower to be sheathed in aluminum, the first to use double-glazed window panels, and was the first to be completely sealed and fully air-conditioned. In 1965, the building was renamed as the Commonwealth Building when the Equitable Center (now Unitus Plaza) opened, which was also designed by Pietro Belluschi.

The Commonwealth Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as the Equitable Building) in 1976. In 1980, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) designated the Commonwealth Building as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. In 1982, the building was the recipient of the Twenty-five Year Award, of the American Institute of Architects. In 1993, Weston Investment Co. LLC bought the building for $1.9 million. Unico Properties and Cigna Realty Investors bought the building in 2007 from Weston for $27 million, and spent $7 million more on renovations to the structure. The building was sold again by Unico in 2013 for $41 million when Unico bought out Cigna. Unico sold the tower to KBS in 2016 for $69 million.

==Features==
Designed by noted Oregon architect Pietro Belluschi, the tower is of the International Style. The 14-story, -tall glass box tower is constructed of sea-green glass and is sheathed in aluminum.

==Designations and awards==
The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is also designated as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the ASME. The ASME History &amp; Heritage Committee bestowed this landmark status for the specific feature: the first large commercial building in the United States to pioneer the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling.

<doc id="1211160" wikidata="Q3571974" url="?curid=1211160" title="Yasuda zaibatsu">
<text>was a financial conglomerate owned and managed by the Yasuda clan. One of the four major zaibatsu of Imperial Japan, it was founded by the entrepreneur Yasuda Zenjirō. It was dissolved at the end of World War II.

==Origins==
Yasuda Zenjirō moved to Edo at the age of 17 and began working in a money changing house. In 1863, he started providing tax-farming services, and greatly magnified his wealth by buying up depreciated Meiji paper money that the government subsequently exchanged for gold. He quickly began to amass newly available capital, establishing the Third National Bank in 1876 and forming the Yasuda Bank (later known as the Fuji Bank) in 1880, the center of the Yasuda zaibatsu.

Yasuda consolidated his empire in banking and finance, specializing in backing small and medium-sized traders and industrialists. In 1880, Yasuda founded the Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Company (now Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance). In 1893, the Yasuda zaibatsu absorbed the Tokyo Fire Insurance Company, later renamed the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company.

==20th century==

The Yasuda focus on banking was narrowed by the merger of eleven Yasuda-controlled banks into the Yasuda Bank in 1913. The post-merger bank was by far the largest of all the zaibatsu banks.

Yasuda Zenjirō was assassinated in 1921 when he refused to make a financial donation to an ultra-nationalist. Zenjirō&#x27;s son, Yasuda Zennosuke, assumed leadership of the zaibatsu. By 1928, the Yasuda zaibatsu was ranked behind only the Mitsui and Mitsubishi groups in total capital. In that year, the Yasuda zaibatsu encompassed 66 companies and reported total capital of ¥308 million.

During World War II, the Japanese government began forcing consolidation of major financial institutions. In January 1942, Hajime Yasuda, the head of the conglomerate, announced that all Yasuda family members would withdraw from related and subsidiary companies, assuming new leadership positions as board members over all zaibatsu concerns.

==Dissolution==
Following Japan&#x27;s defeat in August 1945, Hajime Yasuda and Yasuda executives assumed a leadership role in planning for the dissolution of their own group. The &quot;Yasuda plan&quot; was submitted in October 1945 and stipulated that the Yasuda zaibatsu would be dissolved and that Yasuda Bank would cease to control Yasuda subsidiaries. In addition, family members and executives appointed by them would resign from all Yasuda companies. The Yasuda Plan, with some revisions, was accepted by the U.S. government in November of that year.

==Present day==
After the restoration of the sovereignty of Japan, employment restrictions at Yasuda affiliates were lifted from the Yasuda family, and the Fuyo Group was formed with Fuji Bank, the successor to Yasuda Bank, at the core. Although the Yasuda zaibatsu was revived as a corporate group in the form of a keiretsu, it was no longer controlled by Yasuda family management.

Artist Yoko Ono, the wife of musician John Lennon, is a daughter of the Yasuda clan. She is the great-granddaughter of Yasuda Zenjiro.

<doc id="1211171" wikidata="Q5167905" url="?curid=1211171" title="Cooperative Research Centre">
<text>Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) are an Australian Federal Government program involved in Australian scientific research. The CRC programme is administered by the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources, which provides funding for projects through a series of funding rounds.

==History==
The CRC came about from several internal discussions in Government and particularly from a Round Table that took place at the start of 1991 that included the Hon Bob Hawke, Hon Paul Keating. Since the commencement of the CRC Program in 1991, there have been a number of selection rounds. Selection rounds were conducted in March 1991, December 1991, December 1992, December 1994, and then at regular two-year intervals: 1996 through 2006. 
The very first selected CRC division was the CRC for “Waste Management and Pollution Control”, based on campus of University of New South Wales (UNSW). 
The very first appointment under the CRC was by Assoc. Prof. Raymond J Frost (previously Director for BHP Civil Engineering and Technology). 
Following the review of the Programme in 2008, the 11th and 12th selection rounds were both held in 2009.

Reviews of the CRC program are regularly undertaken. In 2012, an independent impact study found that from 1991 to 2017 CRCs generated a net economic benefit of $7.5 billion. This equates to an annual contribution of $278 million, or around 0.03 percentage points to GDP.

===CRCA/Cooperative Research Australia===
The Cooperative Research Centre Association (CRCA) was established on 1 December 1994 to promote the CRC program while also acting as a conduit for information sharing and learning between CRCs. It was renamed Cooperative Research Australia in 2021 and is active in representing CRCs, post-CRC entities, universities and research organisations as well as businesses involved in R&amp;D.

==Governance and description==
The Cooperative Research Centres program is intended to enhance Australia&#x27;s industrial, commercial and economic growth through development of cooperative public-private research centres that achieve high levels of outcomes in adoption and commercialisation.

The CRC program is administered by the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Science and Resources.

== Past programs ==

=== SERC ===

The Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Space Environment Management was administered by the Space Environment Research Centre (SERC). Based on Mount Stromlo, SERC operated from 2014 to 2021 and conducted research into practical global efforts for space debris management, mitigation and removal. SERC Participants included EOS Space Systems, Lockheed Martin, Optus Satellite, Australian National University, RMIT University and NICT (Japan).

=== Bushfire CRC ===

The Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre was an Australian-based organisation which conducted research into the social, environmental, and economic impact of bushfires. Although the CRC has completed operations, a legacy of a decade of research content is still online and accessible. Funded originally by a grant from the Australian government&#x27;s Cooperative Research Centre in 2003, the Bushfire CRC was funded to 2014 to address key issues raised by recent major fires. The Bushfire CRC was made up of all the fire and land management agencies in Australia and New Zealand, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Attorney General&#x27;s Department and several other fire related organisations. A small executive office was maintained in East Melbourne. The organisation participated in the Cooperative Research Centres Association (CRCA). The work of Bushfire research was carried forward within the expanded research portfolio of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC, from 2013 to 2021, and now with Natural Hazards Research Australia (NHRA). The NHRA was funded for 10 years by the Australian Government on 1 July 2021 as a collaborative research organisation, to address the major challenges arising from natural hazards, including bushfires, floods, cyclones, heatwaves, storms and other hazards. The aim is to deliver usable research and knowledge that creates safer and more resilient communities.

=== CSSIP ===

The Cooperative Research Centre for Sensor Signal and Information Processing (or CSSIP) was an organisation established under the Cooperative Research Centres program. It operated from 1992 to 2006, performing research, development, and education within several Information and Communications Technology areas: CSSIP&#x27;s education arm was assigned to NICTA in mid-2005.

=== CRC Spatial information ===

The CRC for Spatial Information (CRCSI) was a research organisation funded by Australia&#x27;s Cooperative Research Centre Programme (CRC) and by participant contributions. The CRCSI was founded in 2003 with the successful re-bid announced in August 2009. The programme ended in June 2018. The CRCSI conducted research and development projects that involved collaboration between government, corporate, and academic resources. The CRCSI ensured Australia and New Zealand remained relevant in a spatially-connected world. The CRCSI was responsible for innovative research; the application and commercialisation of spatial information technologies by building collaborative partnerships. A study commissioned by the CRCSI and ANZLIC in 2008 found that the spatial information industry contributed between $6.4 and $12.6 billion to Australia&#x27;s GDP in 2006-2007 alone. CRCSI has offices in Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Wellington in New Zealand. The CRCSI research delved into key industry sectors, including: agriculture, natural resources and climate change; defence; built environment; and health through the delivery of spatial information across positioning, rapid spatial analytics and spatial infrastructures.

=== CRC Reef ===
The Cooperative Research Centre for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area operated from 1997 to 2006.

=== DSTC ===
The Cooperative Research Centre for Distributed Systems Technology and the Cooperative Research Centre for Enterprise Distributed Systems were two successive CRC programs operated by the Distributed Systems Technology Centre. Its website was archived following its closure in June 2006.

=== CRC for Advanced Composite Structures ===

The Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures Limited (CRC-ACS) operated from 1996 to 2015.
In 2008 a wholly owned subsidiary, Advanced Composite Structures Australia (ACS-A), was created to manage its rapidly growing commercial activities. When CRC-ACS concluded its mission, the ownership was passed to the then directors and employees of ACS-A who were charged with leading the company into a fully commercial future. 

=== Seafood CRC ===

The Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre (Seafood CRC) received funding from the Commonwealth Government in the tenth round of CRC funding and was established in 2007 and operated until 2014. The CRC&#x27;s areas of research expertise include benchmarking, product innovation, genetics, consumption drivers and barriers, processing, supply chain management technologies, technical market access, health claims and nutritional composition. 
The Seafood CRC resulted in the establishment of the world’s first year-round aquaculture of Yellowtail Kingfish; highly prized for sushi and sashimi. The CRC research had a direct impact on achieving increased fish survival through more effective hatchery management, new information on fish growth and health, superior genetic management and cost-effective dietary formulations.

<text>Arkady Petrovich Gaidar (, born Golikov, ; – 26 October 1941) was a Russian Soviet writer, whose stories were very popular among Soviet children, and a Red Army commander.

==Biography==
Gaidar was born in the town of Lgov, Kursk Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Kursk Oblast, Russia), to a family of teachers of Russian aristocratic descent. Through his noble mother, he was a distant relative of Mikhail Lermontov, whose 2nd great-grandfather was also Gaidar&#x27;s mother&#x27;s direct ancestor. In 1912, the family moved to Arzamas where in 1914 Arkady enrolled in a local secondary school. In 1917, as an ardent 13-year-old Bolshevik follower, Gaidar started to distribute leaflets and patrol the streets. During one such mission, he received his first wound, a stab in the chest.

In 1918, Golikov applied for Communist Party membership and started working for the local newspaper Molot as a correspondent. In August 1918, he became a party member and in December volunteered for the Red Army, having lied about his age. In January 1919, Golikov went to the front as a Special Unit commander&#x27;s adjutant, to fight what Soviet biographies referred to as the &#x27;kulak gangs&#x27;.

Fresh from the 7th Moscow Red Commanders&#x27; courses, Gaidar went to the Ukrainian (later Polish) front as a company commander. In December 1919, injured and shell-shocked, he was demobilised, but in March 1920 returned to the Red Army, to the Caucasian Front&#x27;s 9th Army, 37th Kuban Division, as a company commander again. In summer 1920, Gaidar took part in operations against the units of generals Geyman and Zhitikov.

In 1921, Gaidar participated in the suppression of several anti-communist uprisings, among them Antonovshchina. In 1922, he was moved to the Mongolian border (where the Red Army was fighting White Army units led by colonels Oliferov and Solovyov), but later that year he was hospitalised with traumatic neuroses. He retired from the army in 1924 due to a contusion.

As the Great Patriotic War broke out, Gaidar was sent to the front as a special correspondent for the newspaper &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;. In the fall of 1941, Gaidar and other soldiers were surrounded by German troops. He joined the partisans and became a machine gunner. On 26 October, Gaidar was killed in combat near the village of Lipliave. He was buried in the town of Kaniv.

==Literary work==

In 1925, Gaidar&#x27;s debut novel &quot;In the Days of Defeats and Victories&quot; was published, followed by &quot;Life For Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of a Mountain&quot;, a sci-fi novel and, most notably, &quot;R.V.S.&quot; (1925) which formed a blueprint for his career as a children&#x27;s writer, telling stories of front-line camaraderie and the romanticism of the revolutionary struggle. In 1927, Gaidar moved to Moscow. A year later, he went to Archangelsk to work for a local newspaper, &quot;Pravda Severa&quot;. Back in Moscow, in 1930, he published the novel &quot;School&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Plain Biography&quot;). In the early 1930s, several articles on Gaidar&#x27;s works appeared in the Soviet press, Konstantin Fedin being his major supporter and mentor. In 1939, Gaidar was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour. Short stories &quot;The Military Secret&quot; (1935), &quot;The Blue Cup&quot; (1936) and the novel &quot;Blue Stars&quot; (1939) were followed by his most famous work, &quot;Timur and His Squad&quot; (1940), its hero named after, and partially based on the character of, the author&#x27;s son. A captivating account of an altruistic pioneer youth gave birth to the mass Timur movement among Young Pioneers and other children&#x27;s organisations all over the Soviet Union.

A number of films were made based on his stories. Gaidar&#x27;s books have been translated into many languages.

==Recognition and remembrance==
Gaidar was awarded two orders and several medals.

A monument honouring him was erected in Kaniv in 1953.

Three biographical movies about Arkady Gaidar were released in the USSR: &quot;Serebryanye truby&quot; (Russian: &quot;Silver Trumpets&quot;) (1970), &quot;Konets imperatora taygi&quot; (Russian: &quot;The Death of the Taiga Emperor&quot;) (1978), and &quot;Ostayus s vami&quot; (Russian: &quot;I&#x27;ll Stay with You&quot;) (1981). The latter was a story of Arkady Gaidar&#x27;s last days.

==Pseudonym==
Arkady&#x27;s son, Timur Gaidar published two versions of the pseudonym&#x27;s origin:
#This an abbreviation of French &quot;Golikov Arkady d &#x27; Arsamas&quot;, which means &quot;Golikov, Arkady from Arzamas&quot;.
# Arkady took the name Gaidar from a Khakas language word meaning &quot;going first&quot;, &quot;the leader&quot;. Another version is that the name comes from the Khakas word for &quot;Where is?&quot; which is the question Gaidar would shout as he and his unit went from village to village in the Yenisei River region tracking down (and eventually killing) the Cossack hetman he was pursuing during the Civil War.

==Family==
Arkady Gaidar&#x27;s father, Pyotr Isidorovich Golikov, a teacher (after the 1917 Revolution a Red Army commissar), came from a working-class family. His mother, Natalya Arkadyevna Golikova (née Salkova), also a teacher (after the Revolution a doctor), was a daughter of a Tsarist Army officer. Arkady was the first of the couple&#x27;s four children. His three sisters were Natalya, Olga and Yekaterina.

The Russian economist Yegor Gaidar was Arkady Gaidar&#x27;s grandson. Yegor Gaidar&#x27;s father, Rear Admiral Timur Gaidar, was his son.

Maria Gaidar (born 1982), Russian activist, is a daughter of Yegor Gaidar.

<text>The Government of Western Australia is the Australian state democratic administrative authority of Western Australia. It is also commonly referred to as the WA Government or the Western Australian Government. The Government of Western Australia, a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, was formed in 1890 as prescribed in its Constitution, as amended from time to time. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, Western Australia has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Constitution of Australia regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth. Under the Australian Constitution, Western Australia ceded legislative and judicial supremacy to the Commonwealth, but retained powers in all matters not in conflict with the Commonwealth.

==History==
==Executive and judicial powers==
Western Australia is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the Parliament of Western Australia, which consists of King Charles III, represented by the Governor of Western Australia, and the two Houses, the Western Australian Legislative Council (the upper house) and the Western Australian Legislative Assembly (the lower house). Executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of all ministers and is presided over by the governor.

The Governor, as representative of the Crown, is the formal repository of power, which is exercised by him or her on the advice of the Premier of Western Australia and the Cabinet. The Premier and Ministers are appointed by the Governor, and hold office by virtue of their ability to command the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly. Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court of Western Australia and a system of subordinate courts, but the High Court of Australia and other federal courts have overriding jurisdiction on matters which fall under the ambit of the Australian Constitution.

==Ministries==

, the following individuals serve as government ministers, at the pleasure of the King, represented by the Governor of Western Australia. All ministers and are members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

<doc id="1211181" wikidata="Q1119133" url="?curid=1211181" title="Jezail">
<text>The jezail or &quot;jezzail&quot; (, ultimately from the plural form , &quot;long [barrels]&quot;) is a simple, cost-efficient and often handmade long arm commonly used in Afghanistan in the past. It was popular amongst the Pashtun tribesmen, who deposed Shah Shuja. Jezails were primarily used in the First and Second Anglo-Afghan Wars by Pashtuns.

==Features==
Jezails were generally handmade weapons, and consequently they varied widely in their construction. Jezails were seen as very personal weapons, and unlike the typical military weapons of the time which were very plain and utilitarian, jezails tended to be well crafted and were usually intricately decorated. 

Jezails tended to have very long barrels. Such lengths were never common in European rifles (with the exception of the Spanish circa 15th century), but were more common in American rifles, such as the Kentucky rifle. The American rifles were used for hunting, and tended to be of a smaller caliber with being typical. Jezails were usually designed for warfare, and therefore tended to be of larger calibers than the American rifles, with caliber and larger being common. Larger calibers were possible because the long length of the typical jezail meant that it was heavier than typical muskets of the time. Jezails typically weighed around , compared to for a typical musket. The heavy weight of the jezail allowed the rifle itself to absorb more energy from the round, imparting less recoil to the weapon&#x27;s user.

Many jezails were smoothbore weapons, but some had their barrels rifled. The rifling, combined with the barrel&#x27;s long length, made these weapons very accurate for their time.

The firing mechanism was typically either a matchlock or a flintlock. Since flintlock mechanisms were complex and difficult to manufacture, many jezails used the lock mechanism from captured or broken Brown Bess muskets.

The stocks were handmade and ornately decorated, featuring a distinctive curve which is not seen in the stocks of other muskets. The function of this curve is debated; it may be purely decorative, or it may have allowed the jezail to be tucked under the arm and cradled tightly against the body, as opposed to being held to the shoulder like a typical musket or rifle. The argument against this method of firing is that the flash pan would be dangerously close to the face and the weapon would be harder to aim. It is more likely that the rifle was only tucked under the arm whilst riding a horse or a camel. The curve may also have saved weight; by shaving away some of the heavy wood used for the stock through employment of the new curved shape, whilst maintaining the same structural integrity of the stock it could still be fired from the shoulder safely whilst also being lighter. The weapon was fired by grasping the stock near the trigger, like a pistol, while the curved portion is tucked under the shooter&#x27;s forearm, allowing the rifle to be fired with one hand while mounted.

Jezails were often fired from a forked rest, or a horn or metal bipod.

==Anglo-Afghan Wars==

During this period, the jezail was the primary weapon used by the Pashtuns and was used with great effect during the First Anglo-Afghan War. British Brown Bess smoothbore muskets were effective at no more than 150 yards, and unable to be consistently accurate beyond 50 yards. Because of their advantage in range, Pashtun marksmen typically used the jezail from the tops of cliffs along valleys and defiles during ambushes. This tactic repeatedly inflicted heavy casualties on the British during their 1842 retreat from Kabul to Jalalabad.

In the First Anglo-Afghan War the British established a cantonment outside of Kabul with dirt walls approximately waist high. Surrounding the cantonment were several abandoned forts which, although out of range of British muskets, were close enough for jezail fire. When ghazi and other Pashtuns forces besieged Kabul and the cantonment, they occupied the forts and used them to snipe at British forces from a safe range.

A description from the British Library dating to the First Anglo-Afghan War:
==In British literature==
The jezail is the weapon which wounded Dr. Watson—the fictional biographer of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes—in the Battle of Maiwand during his military service in Afghanistan. In &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Watson mentions being wounded in the shoulder. However, in &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;, Watson gives the location of the wound as in his leg. In &quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&quot; Watson refers to the Jezail bullet being &quot;in one of my limbs.&quot; These discrepancies have caused debate by Sherlock Holmes fans about which of these locations is the &quot;correct&quot; location of the wound.

The jezail is mentioned repeatedly in some of Wilbur Smith&#x27;s books, most notably &quot;Monsoon&quot;. It was also mentioned in the George MacDonald Fraser adventure &quot;Flashman&quot;, whose protagonist describes the awful slaughter of British troops retreating from Kabul to Jalalabad by Pashtun jezailchis. 

The weapon appears in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1886 poem &quot;Arithmetic on the Frontier&quot;, where the low cost of the weapon is contrasted with the relatively expensive training and education of British officers: 
:&quot;A scrimmage in a Border Station&quot;
:&quot;A canter down some dark defile&quot;
:&quot;Two thousand pounds of education&quot;
:&quot;Drops to a ten-rupee jezail.&quot;

Another reference to the jezail occurs in Kipling&#x27;s novel &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot;, where the Kohat Jezail is mentioned along with the more advanced Snider and Martini rifles of the British.

P. G. Wodehouse in &quot;Jill the Reckless&quot; (1920) describes how the character Uncle Chris, in India during his first hill-campaign, would &quot;walk up and down in front of his men under a desultory shower of jezail-bullets&quot;.
The rifle is also mentioned by Brian Jacques in his adventure novel, Voyage of Slaves.

==Contemporary use==
The jezail no longer sees widespread use in warfare of any nature. Limited numbers were, however, used by Mujahideen rebels during the Soviet–Afghan War. Derivatives of the jezail, barely recognizable, and usually termed &#x27;country-made weapons&#x27;, are in use in rural India—especially in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

== In popular culture ==
* In Team Fortress 2, there is a weapon named &quot;Bazaar Bargain&quot; which is modeled after the Jezail.
* In the first case of &quot;The Great Ace Attorney&quot;, the victim is Dr. John Watson (changed to &quot;Wilson&quot; in the localization). His killer is revealed to be Jezaille Brett, a woman whose name references Watson&#x27;s death by Jezail rifle in the original books.

<doc id="1211185" wikidata="Q6141959" url="?curid=1211185" title="James Reilly (Canadian politician)">
<text>James Reilly (March 28, 1835 – July 9, 1909) was a Canadian businessman and politician. He was the sixth mayor of Calgary, Alberta.

==Early life==
Reilly was born in 1835 in Napierville, Quebec, to immigrant parents from Ireland. In Quebec he became an architect and builder before going to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1882, then to Calgary in 1883. In Calgary he became actively involved with the local community. He played a key part in organizing a citizens group concerned about the location of the railway station that was built in Calgary. While proprietor of the Royal Hotel, he organized the first civic committee meeting on January 4, 1884. This was the first step leading to Calgary&#x27;s municipal incorporation later that year.

==Political life==
Reilly continually sought opportunities for political positions throughout his time in Calgary, although only succeeding at the local level as councillor and mayor for Calgary.

Reilly ran for mayor in Calgary&#x27;s second municipal election in January 1886, and lost the popular vote to incumbent George Murdoch. Stipendiary magistrate Jeremiah Travis overturned the result of the January 1886 election on weak charges of corruption by Murdoch, and appointed Reilly the mayor of Calgary. Murdoch would not accept Travis&#x27; order and both parties attempted to govern the town, leading to dysfunction and the absence of local government until the federal government reorganized the Northwest Territories governance, suspended Travis and a new election was organized for November 1886. Neither Reilly or Murdoch would contest the November 1886 election. The City of Calgary recognizes Murdoch as the elected mayor in January 1886.

Reilly would later be elected town councillor in 1890, and subsequently be elected Calgary&#x27;s sixth mayor in 1891. Reilly served one term as mayor, and was again elected as a councillor in 1892. After serving one term as councillor, Reilly would remain out of municipal politics until second election as mayor in 1898.

===Territorial election attempts===
Reilly would contest several Northwest Territory general elections, including the 1894, 1898 and 1902 Northwest Territories general election in the constituency of East Calgary. Reilly would never garner more than 22 per cent of the vote, or finish better than third.

===Federal election attempt===
James Reilly would contest the 1891 Canadian federal election for the Alberta (Provisional District), losing by a considerable margin to Donald Watson Davis. In an advertisement in the February 28, 1891 Edmonton Bulletin, Reilly would explain his platform which was primarily focused on having Alberta become a province in Confederation. Reilly would also support greater trade through railways with the United States, local options for liquor prohibition, greater commercial development in Banff, Alberta, removal of the Sarcee people for urban expansion, and supported the claims of Métis people for recognition from the government. While it is noted by historians that Reilly was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, and he was supported in his election by future Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Oliver, Reilly noted in an advertisement in the Edmonton Bulletin that he is &quot;a Conservative and supporter of that policy of Sir John A. Macdonald that has built up the financial credit of Canada...&quot;.

==Later life==
In October 1899, Reilly left Calgary and traveled extensively. He retired in Victoria, British Columbia, where he died on July 9, 1909, from influenza. His death came as a shock to many, as his condition had been seemingly improving. He was later interred in Calgary. After his death, it was said that &quot;to write the life of the late James Reilly is to rewrite the history of Calgary.&quot; Reilly was married to May Watts.

<text>Eric Singer (born Eric Doyle Mensinger; May 12, 1958) is an American drummer. Associated with the hard rock band Kiss on and off from 1991 until the band&#x27;s retirement in 2023, he has also performed with artists such as Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Lita Ford, Badlands, Brian May and Gary Moore as well as his own band ESP. In his career, Singer has appeared on over 75 albums and 11 EPs.

==Early life==

Singer was born May 12, 1958, Eric Doyle Mensinger in Cleveland, Ohio. He grew up in Euclid, Ohio. He graduated from Euclid High School in 1976. His father, Johnny Mensinger, was of Jewish German descent and was a local big band leader who played around the area as well as on cruise ships from the United States to Europe and back. Eric&#x27;s brother Jon Mensinger was a principal dancer for the Mark Morris Dance Group in New York. Young Eric began playing drums from an early age, and was inspired by bands such as Humble Pie, the Who, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, the Beatles and Queen and drummers such as John Bonham, Keith Moon, Cozy Powell, Roger Taylor, Bill Ward, and Buddy Rich.

Singer worked at King Musical instruments before becoming a professional drummer.

== Career ==
Singer&#x27;s first professional drumming job was in the Cleveland band Beau Coup. He then became Lita Ford&#x27;s touring drummer in 1984. In 1985 he joined Black Sabbath and recorded and toured to support the &quot;Seventh Star&quot; album. In 1987, during the recordings of &quot;The Eternal Idol&quot; he left the band to tour with Gary Moore band in support of his album &quot;Wild Frontier&quot;. After the tour, he was invited by his Black Sabbath colleague Ray Gillen to join Badlands. Singer accepted and played on the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album. Singer left the group in 1989 as he would join Paul Stanley as his touring drummer on his solo tour of the United States and Canada. Singer played with Olivia Newton-John in the music video for &quot;Culture Shock&quot;. He later revealed in an interview that he obtained that gig because he was working for Lita Ford at the time.

=== Kiss ===

In December 1991, Singer officially became the drummer for Kiss after the death of Eric Carr. Singer, who had performed with Paul Stanley on his club tour along with Bob Kulick two years earlier, was hired and debuted with the band on the album &quot;Revenge&quot;, on which he was originally slated to fill in on some tracks while Eric Carr recuperated from heart cancer. Singer played on &quot;Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions&quot; and toured with Kiss until 1996, when the band reunited with original drummer Peter Criss and guitarist Ace Frehley for the Alive/Worldwide Tour.

After five relatively quiet years, during which Singer toured with Queen guitarist Brian May, Singer was asked to rejoin Kiss in 2001 after Criss&#x27; departure shortly before the Australian and Japanese leg of Kiss&#x27; Farewell tour. Singer debuted in full &quot;Catman&quot; makeup and costume for the first time on the tour, which caused some controversy as the persona had previously been used only by Criss. Singer was replaced again by Criss in late 2002 but returned to the band in early 2004 after Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley opted not to renew Criss&#x27; contract. Since then, Singer has been playing drums in Kiss as their permanent drummer.

In 2009, Singer, along with lead guitarist Tommy Thayer, played and sang on the Kiss album &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;, the first studio album to feature the new line-up. It included the track &quot;All for the Glory&quot; (written by Stanley and Simmons) with vocals by Singer. In October 2012, Kiss released their 20th studio album &quot;Monster&quot; which includes a track called &quot;All for the Love of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; sung by Singer (written by Stanley).

In a 2008 interview, Peter Criss stated that he thought Singer was a great drummer, despite being upset about Singer using his image.

=== Eric Singer Project, Alice Cooper and other projects ===
When not touring with Kiss, Singer performed with Alice Cooper. Singer had been a member of Cooper&#x27;s band since the release of the album &quot;Brutal Planet&quot; in 2000. Singer had already performed with Cooper years earlier, during the tours for the album &quot;Trash and Hey Stoopid.&quot; Singer has been featured on three Alice Cooper albums to date, namely, &quot;Brutal Planet&quot;, &quot;The Eyes of Alice Cooper&quot;, and &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;. In 2008, Eric Singer left Cooper&#x27;s band on Cooper&#x27;s suggestion that he (Eric) instead focus on his growing commitments with Kiss as well as with the Eric Singer Project (ESP).

He performed and recorded with his band ESP, featuring, among others, his former Kiss bandmate Bruce Kulick and former Mötley Crüe lead singer John Corabi. Three releases have resulted from this collaboration: the studio album &quot;Lost and Spaced&quot; (1998), consisting completely of covers from classic rock songs; the live album &quot;Live in Japan&quot; (2006); and the DVD &quot;Live at the Marquee&quot; (2006).

Singer has also played in the band Avantasia, replacing drummer Alex Holzwarth after a guest performance in the song &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; from the album &quot;The Metal Opera Part II&quot;. Two EPs and one full album have been released with Singer&#x27;s performance on the drums: &quot;Lost in Space Part I&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space Part II&quot;, and &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, and on several songs from &quot;The Wicked Symphony&quot; and &quot;Angel of Babylon&quot;.

In 1989, he made a brief appearance in the Wes Craven film &quot;Shocker&quot;, as a member of a fictional rock band.

In 1998, he toured with Queen guitarist, Brian May, in a solo tour as part of The Brian May Band. He was brought in as a replacement for Cozy Powell who had died earlier that year.

In 2004 Singer was featured on Italian rock singer Chris Catena&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Freak Out&quot;. He recorded drums for two tracks, &quot;Sweet Talker&quot; (a Whitesnake cover) and &quot;The Stronger You Are, The Harder You Fall&quot;.

In 2015 Singer was elected to the jury of watchmaking&#x27;s highest awards, the Grand Prix d&#x27;Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG). He is a well known in collectors circles as a collector of eclectic timepieces from his home town favorite Ball to expensive Glashutte Origina, Zenith, Omega and IWC. His keen eye to mechanics and artistic design encouraged the GPHG to invite him to join the rotating group of 26 jurors in Geneva this November as they select the best watches of 2015.

Eric is also the drummer for Paul Stanley&#x27;s side project Soul Station, showcasing the best Motown and Soul hits.

==Equipment==
Throughout his career, Singer has used Pearl drums, hardware and pedals; Remo and Terry Bozzio Attack signature drumheads; Zildjian cymbals and drumsticks; and ddrum acoustic drum triggers. Singer has his own signature series snare drum and artist series drumsticks by Pearl, and Zildjian also makes its own &quot;Eric Singer Artist Series&quot; drumsticks.
