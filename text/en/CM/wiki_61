<text>Sarah Moore Grimké (November 26, 1792 – December 23, 1873) was an American abolitionist, widely held to be the mother of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Born and reared in South Carolina to a prominent and wealthy planter family, she moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 1820s and became a Quaker, as did her younger sister Angelina. The sisters began to speak on the abolitionist lecture circuit, joining a tradition of women who had been speaking in public on political issues since colonial days, including Susanna Wright, Hannah Griffitts, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Anna Dickinson. They recounted their knowledge of slavery firsthand, urged abolition, and also became activists for women&#x27;s rights.

==Early life==
Sarah Grimké – her parents sometimes called her &quot;Sally&quot;– was born in South Carolina, the sixth of 14 children and the second daughter of Mary Smith and John Faucheraud Grimké. Their father was a rich planter and slave owner, an attorney and judge in South Carolina, and at one point Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives.

Sarah&#x27;s early experiences with education shaped her future as an abolitionist and feminist. Throughout her childhood, although highly intelligent, she was keenly aware of the inferiority of her education when compared to her brothers&#x27; classical one. Although her family recognized her remarkable intelligence, she was prevented from obtaining a substantive education or pursuing her dream of becoming an attorney, as these goals were considered &quot;unwomanly.&quot; She was educated by private tutors on subjects considered appropriate for a young Southern woman of her class, including French, embroidery, painting with watercolors, and playing the harpsichord. Her father allowed Sarah to study geography, history, and mathematics from the books in his library, and to read his law books; however, he drew the line at her learning Latin.

Sarah&#x27;s mother Mary was a dedicated homemaker and an active member in the community. She was a leader of the Charleston&#x27;s Ladies Benevolent Society. Mary was also an active Episcopalian and consequently often devoted herself to the poor and to women incarcerated in a nearby prison. Mary&#x27;s beliefs were rigid.

Feeling confined in her role, Sarah developed a connection to her family&#x27;s slaves to an extent that unsettled her parents. From the time she was 12 years old, Sarah spent her Sunday afternoons teaching Bible classes to the young slaves on the plantation, an experience she found frustrating. While she desperately wanted to teach them to read the Scripture for themselves, and they had a longing for such learning, her parents prohibited this, as teaching slaves to read was illegal in South Carolina. Her parents also said that literacy would only make the slaves unhappy and rebellious, making them unfit for manual labor. Teaching slaves to read had been prohibited since 1740 in South Carolina.

Sarah secretly taught Hetty, her personal enslaved girl, to read and write, but when her parents discovered the young tutor at work, the vehemence of her father&#x27;s response proved alarming. He was furious and nearly had the young slave girl whipped. Fear of causing trouble for the slaves themselves prevented Sarah from undertaking such a task again. Years afterward, she reflected on the incident, writing &quot;I took an almost malicious satisfaction in teaching my little waiting maid at night, when she was supposed to be occupied in combing and brushing my locks. The light was put out, the keyhole screened, and flat on our stomachs before the fire, with the spelling book under our eyes, we defied the laws of South Carolina.&quot;

Sarah&#x27;s brother Thomas went to Yale Law School in 1805. During his visits home, Thomas continued teaching Sarah new ideas about the dangers of Enlightenment and the importance of religion. (Thomas died young, and was described in an obituary as most proud of his piety.) These ideas, combined with her secret studies of the law, gave her some of the basis for her later work as an activist. Her father told her that if she had been a man, she would have been the greatest lawyer in South Carolina. Lerner gives a somewhat different version, in which her father said &quot;she would have made the greatest jurist in the country.&quot; Sarah believed her inability to get higher education was unfair. She wondered at the behavior of her family and neighbors, who encouraged slaves to be baptized and to attend worship services, but did not consider them true brothers and sisters in faith.

From her youth, Sarah believed that religion should take a more proactive role in improving the lives of those who suffered most. Her religious quest took her first to Presbyterianism; she converted in 1817. After moving to Philadelphia in 1821, she joined the Quakers, whom she had learned about in an earlier visit with her father. There, she became an outspoken advocate for education and suffrage for African Americans and women.

==Becoming an abolitionist==
In 1817 Sarah&#x27;s father was seriously ill, and the doctors of Charleston recommended he travel to Philadelphia to consult Dr. Philip Syng Physick. Despite her vehement objections, her father insisted that Sarah, then 26 years old, accompany him as his nursemaid. Sarah relented, and they left Charleston for the north in May, 1819. When Physick found he could not help, he suggested that they take in the sea air of the fishing village of Long Branch, New Jersey. The pair settled into a boardinghouse, where, after just a few weeks, John Faucheraud Grimké died.

As a result of this experience, Sarah became more self-assured, independent, and morally responsible. She decided she would not make her home in South Carolina:

She stayed in Philadelphia a few months after her father died and met Israel Morris, who would introduce her to Quakerism, specifically the writings of John Woolman. She returned to Charleston but decided that she would go back to Philadelphia to become a Quaker minister and leave her Episcopalian upbringing behind. She was stymied, however, when she was repeatedly ignored and shut out by the male-dominated Quaker council. Becoming alienated, she later wrote, &quot;I think no criminal under sentence of death can look more fearfully to the day of execution than I do towards our Yearly Meeting.&quot;

She returned to Charleston in the spring of 1827 to &quot;save&quot; her sister Angelina from the limitations of the South. Angelina visited Sarah in Philadelphia from July to November of the same year and returned to Charleston committed to the Quaker faith. After leaving Charleston, Angelina and Sarah traveled around New England speaking on the abolitionist circuit, at first addressing women only in large parlors and small churches. Their speeches concerning abolition and women&#x27;s rights reached thousands. In November, 1829, Angelina joined her sister in Philadelphia. They had long had a close relationship; for years, Angelina called Sarah &quot;mother&quot;, as Sarah was both her godmother and primary caretaker.

In 1868, Sarah discovered that her late brother had three illegitimate mixed-race sons by a &quot;personal&quot; enslaved woman. Welcoming them into the family, Sarah worked to provide funds to educate Archibald Grimké and Francis James Grimké, who went on to successful careers and marriages, and were leaders in the African-American community. John, the youngest, was not interested in formal education and returned to the South to live.

==Activism and legacy==
Sarah and Angelina had come to loathe slavery and all its degradations. They had hoped that their new faith would be more accepting of their abolitionist beliefs than their former had been. However, their initial attempts to attack slavery caused them difficulties in the Quaker community. The sisters persisted despite their belief that the fight for women&#x27;s rights was as important as the fight to abolish slavery. Although Sarah had the desire to &#x27;equip women for economic independence and for social usefulness&#x27; [22], they continued to be attacked, even by some abolitionists, who considered their position extreme. In 1836, Sarah published &quot;&quot; In 1837, &quot;&quot; was published serially in a Massachusetts newspaper, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and immediately reprinted in &quot;The Liberator&quot;, the newspaper published by radical abolitionist and women&#x27;s rights leader William Lloyd Garrison. The letters were published in book form in 1838.

When the sisters were together in Philadelphia, they devoted themselves to charity work and to the Society of Friends (the proper name for the religion often called &quot;Quaker&quot;). Sarah began working toward becoming a clergy member but was continually discouraged by male members of the church. Sarah realized that, though the church was something she agreed with in theory, it was not delivering on its promises. It was around this time that anti-slavery rhetoric began entering public discourse.

Joining her sister in the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1836, Sarah originally felt that she had found the place where she truly belonged, in which her thoughts and ideas were encouraged. However, as she and Angelina began speaking not only on abolition but also on the importance of women&#x27;s rights, they began to face much criticism. Their public speeches were seen as unwomanly because they spoke to mixed-gender audiences, called &quot;promiscuous audiences&quot; at the time. They also publicly debated men who disagreed with them. This was too much for the general public of 1837 and caused many harsh attacks on their womanhood; one line of thought suggested that they were both just poor &quot;spinsters&quot; displaying themselves in order to find any man who would be willing to take one.

In 1838, Angelina married Theodore Weld, a leading abolitionist who had been a severe critic of their inclusion of women&#x27;s rights into the abolition movement. She retired to the background of the movement while being a wife and mother, though not immediately. Sarah completely ceased to speak publicly. Apparently Weld had recently written her a letter detailing her inadequacies in speaking. He tried to explain that he wrote this out of love for her, but said that she was damaging the cause, not helping it, unlike her sister. However, as Sarah received many requests to speak over the following years (as did Angelina), it is questionable whether her &quot;inadequacies&quot; were as bad as he described.

During the Civil War, Sarah wrote and lectured in support of President Abraham Lincoln.

Sarah Moore Grimké was the author of the first developed public argument for women&#x27;s equality. She worked to rid the United States of slavery, Christian churches which had become &quot;unchristian,&quot; and prejudice against African Americans and women.

Her writings gave suffrage workers such as Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott several arguments and ideas that they would need to help end slavery and begin the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

Sarah Grimké is categorized as not only an abolitionist but also a feminist because she challenged the Society of Friends, which touted women&#x27;s inclusion but denied her. It was through her abolitionist pursuits that she became more sensitive to the restrictions on women. She so opposed being subject to men that she refused to marry. Both Sarah and Angelina became very involved in the anti-slavery movement and published volumes of literature and letters on the topic. When they became well known, they began lecturing around the country on the issue. At the time women did not speak in public meetings, so Sarah was viewed as a leader in feminist issues. She openly challenged women&#x27;s domestic roles.

The papers of the Grimké family are in the South Carolina Historical Society, Charleston, South Carolina. The Weld–Grimké papers are in the William L. Clements Library, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Papers of Sarah Grimké are held by the University of Texas Library, Austin, Texas. The Library of Congress holds 5 letters from her to Sarah Mapps Douglass.

The first volume of &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, published in 1881, is inscribed to the memory of the Grimké sisters, among others.

In 1998, the Grimké sisters were inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In November 2019, a newly reconstructed bridge over the Neponset River in Hyde Park was renamed for the Grimké sisters. It is now known as the Grimké Sisters Bridge.

The Grimké sisters are remembered on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

== Views on faith and creation ==
Sarah Grimké&#x27;s view on abolition is clear based on her activism, and she was a major female player in the abolition movement. These views were rooted in her Quaker faith, and she believed, similar to her sister, that slavery was contrary to God&#x27;s will. Similarly, her views on women&#x27;s rights were rooted in her interpretation of the Bible. She had strong opinions especially on the story of creation. She believed Adam and Eve were created equally, unlike many who believed Eve was created as a gift for Adam. She also assigns much of the blame for the fall to Adam, who was tempted by an equal, instead of Eve, who was tempted by a supernatural evil, which is more forgivable given her innocence. This was a main argument in Grimké&#x27;s letter titled &quot;The Original Equality of Woman,&quot; which describes her view of the equality of the sexes, discussed further in other letters.

Sarah Grimké used Scripture in most of her writings that demonstrated her dedication to the Quaker faith and her genuine belief in its compatibility with activism. In 1837 Sarah responded to a &quot;Pastoral Letter&quot; that reinforced Biblical interpretations supporting the role of females in the &quot;private sphere&quot; only&quot;, &quot;using Scripture to provide the benefits and power of this position. Sarah responded to this letter also with Scripture, encouraging women to take on a motto of &#x27;The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?&#x27; She must feel, if she feels rightly, that she is filling one of the most important duties laid upon her as an accountable being, and that her character, instead of being &#x27;unnatural&#x27;, is in exact accordance with the will of Him,&quot;. Her faith and closeness to God were a critical factor in her ability to be unafraid during times of opposition and to argue on behalf of women and slaves well.

==Writings==
Sarah composed a series of letters regarding women and their place in society, specifically within the church, that were later compiled in to a book titled &quot;Letters on the Equality of Sexes and the Condition of Women.&quot; It is in these letters that she discusses the wrongs done to women that are inconsistent with the Bible and gives advice on how women ought to combat these issues. This book was published in 1838, but her writings and letters, as well as her sister&#x27;s, had been circulating for years due to the publications of their writings in &quot;The Liberator&quot; by William Lloyd Garrison.

In her first letter, dated January 11, 1837, she states that she relies solely on Scripture because she believes &quot;almost everything that has been written on this subject [women&#x27;s sphere], has been the result of a misconception of simple truths revealed in the Scriptures&quot; outlining a clear intent and purpose for the analysis that follows. It is in these letters that she condemns the behavior of American men&#x27;s treatment of women and slaves simply as a means to promote and benefit themselves. Letters 5-8 are dedicated to the evaluation of the condition of women in different countries, including Asia, Africa, Greenland, and the US, revealing the depth and breadth of her interest in women&#x27;s issues stretched. Later, she declares that men are equally guilty in &quot;the fall&quot; (of Adam and Eve in the Bible) of humankind and therefore disproving the eternal punishment previously laid upon women as a result of their alleged irresponsibility. In the conclusion of her letters she acknowledges the striking ideas they pose and the newness to these discussions among Christians, but urges them to &quot;investigate them fearlessly and prayerfully, and not shrink from the examination,&quot; which was characteristic of her writing and speeches.

<text>Sharpstown is a master-planned community in the Southwest Management District (formerly Greater Sharpstown), Southwest Houston, Texas. It was one of the first communities to be built as a master-planned, automobile centered community and the first in Houston. Frank Sharp (1906–1993), the developer of the subdivision, made provisions not only for homes but also for schools, shopping and recreation areas. While this model has been duplicated countless times in the past fifty years, at the time it was quite revolutionary, attracting national media attention. The development was dedicated on March 13, 1955.

==Overview==
The residential architecture in Sharpstown consists of post–World War II bungalows, modern and traditional homes. The materials used in building these homes were of sound quality and have withstood the wear and tear of the baby boomer generation as well as the test of time.

==History==

Sharp donated a 300-foot-wide strip of land through the development to the state of Texas for construction of the Southwest Freeway (Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59). This routing ensured easy access from Downtown Houston to homes in the neighborhood, as well as to PlazAmericas (formerly Sharpstown Mall and Sharpstown Center) (1961), Houston&#x27;s first air-conditioned, enclosed shopping mall.

From the 1980 U.S. Census to the 1990 Census, many African-Americans left traditional African-American neighborhoods and entered parts of Southwest Houston such as Sharpstown. The Hispanic population increased by an amount between 1,000 and 3,500 per square mile. Many Asian-Americans also moved into the Sharpstown area, creating one of the largest concentrations of Asian-Americans in Houston. Glenda Kay Joe, an Asian community leader, said in a 1991 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article that the Sharpstown Civic Association and the &quot;Southwest Advocate&quot; newspaper opposed Asian-American settlement in Sharpstown. According to Joe, once Sharpstown residents became accustomed with Asian immigrants, the opposition disappeared.

Sharpstown was affected by the Sharpstown scandal. The scandal combined with a set of apartment complexes that became run-down ensured that Sharpstown became a neighborhood surrounded by crime by the mid-to-late 1990s. 
Crime increased in the 1990s with the deterioration of area apartment complexes.

A 1992 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article described Sharpstown as &quot;a racially mixed neighborhood with a strong Vietnamese community.&quot;

With Sharpstown&#x27;s close-in location, there is renewed interest in revitalizing the neighborhood. In 2005, median home prices in Sharpstown had roughly doubled since 2000.

In a 2007 &quot;Houston Press&quot; article journalist John Nova Lomax said &quot;residential Sharpstown never changes&quot; and that &quot;the houses are still decent and the apartments still rotten.&quot;

In 2010, Mary Ellen Carroll, a conceptual artist who taught at Rice University&#x27;s School of Architecture realized Phase I of the work prototype 180. The catalytic moment was the 180 degree revolution of the single-family home and its surrounding lot at 6513 Sharpview in Sharpstown Section I. prototype 180 occupies architecture to make it perform, albeit as a work of art. It is a collection of processes that utilize land-use policy or no zoning, and the lack thereof in Houston as a material condition and is an example of &#x27;considered urbanism&#x27;. The site functions as a visible museum of post-war planned communities and architectural interventions. prototype 180 raises questions regarding planning and policy in aging first ring developments.
 In 2017, the structure that had been compromised during Hurricane Harvey was &#x27;unbuilt&#x27; in a performance on November 11, 2017 in front of an invited, live public audience for Phase II of prototype 180. The unbuilding of the structure was titled Daringly Unbuilt and was introduced by the Charles Renfro, a partner in the firm Diller, Scofidio + Renfro and the performance artist Joseph Keckler sang a requiem accompanied accompanied by the acclaimed violinist Rubén Rengel.

Phase III for prototype 180 will be the rebuilding of the structure that will be done with a proprietary process that incorporates a substrate made by reconstituting the salvaged building materials to rebuild the original structure and the creation of an ethno-botanic garden in the land surrounding the structure.

During the same year the &quot;Houston Press&quot; named Sharpstown the 2010 &quot;Best Hidden Neighborhood.&quot; The &quot;Houston Press&quot; stated that Sharpstown &quot;is less a &quot;hidden&quot; neighborhood than it is one that&#x27;s undervalued and underrated.&quot; In 2013 &quot;Houstonia&quot; magazine stated that Sharpstown was one of the &quot;25 Hottest Neighborhoods&quot; in Houston.

==Cityscape==
Sharpstown has a lot of mid-century style houses on large lots.

==Government and infrastructure==

The Houston Fire Department operates the Fire Station 51 Sharpstown along Bellaire Boulevard, a part of Fire District 68. Station 51 opened in 1962. Since then it had two facelifts and a renovation in the financial year of 1999.

After the 2012 redristricting process, Sharpstown is split between and 

The neighborhood is served by two Houston Police Department patrol divisions. Areas north and west of Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59 are served by the Midwest Patrol Division. Areas south and east of I-69/U.S. 59 are served by the Fondren Patrol Division. The portion that is now in the Midwest Patrol Division was formerly in the Westside Patrol Division. At one time the police department operated the Sharpstown-area police storefront at Bellaire Boulevard at Rogerdale.

The City of Houston Health Department operates the Sharpstown Health Services clinic. Harris Health System (formerly Harris County Hospital District) designated Valbona Health Center (formerly People&#x27;s Health Center) in Greater Sharpstown for ZIP code 77074. The nearest public hospital is Ben Taub General Hospital in the Texas Medical Center.

===Political representation===
The City of Houston instituted the current nine city council districts in 1979. Sharpstown has been districted in District F since 1980. District council members elected to the Houston City Council have been past presidents of the Sharpstown Civic Association – John Goodner (1980–1993), Ray Driscoll (1994–1999), Mark Ellis (2000–2003), M.J. Khan (2004–2010), and Aloysius Hoang (2010/11 – prior to the City of Houston redistricting). As of 2011, Sharpstown was redistricted into District J where Mike Laster is the newly elected council member.

Houston City Council District J now covers Sharpstown. District J was created to allow Hispanics to more easily elect representatives who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J in order to ensure that Sharpstown and Gulfton were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not. City Council District F previously covered Sharpstown. As of 2008 M. J. Khan represented the district.

In 1989, during a city council race, many in Sharpstown voted for Jim Westmoreland for an at-large position. In one precinct 68.5 percent of the voting residents voted for him. Westmoreland drew controversy after reports of a joke that was characterized as racist spread. Westmoreland was defeated in that race. In a 1989 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article, Nancy Palm, a Republican Party activist from western Houston, said that the residents who voted for Westmoreland had social ties with them and did not see the controversy as significant. In the first 1991 Mayor of Houston election most Sharpstown voters voted for Bob Lanier. By December 3, 1991, increases in crime and changes of demographics in southwestern Houston neighborhoods lead to many challengers desiring to fill the city council seat of District F. In 2005 Khan promoted an anti-graffiti campaign in Sharpstown and other communities in his district.

== Culture, parks, and recreation ==
The city operates Sharpstown Park and the Sharpstown Golf Course along Bellaire Boulevard, in Sharpstown Country Club Estates Harbor Town Addition. In 2003 Wendy Grossman of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that the course &quot;looks like a rundown city park with yellow paint chipping off the curb.&quot; The course has an on-site pro shop and an on-site restaurant behind the shop. An employee in the on-site pro shop stated that Sharpstown Park Golf Course was the flattest course in the city. The golf course first opened in the 1950s as the Sharpstown Country Club Golf Course. At the time it housed fifty sand traps, five lakes, and a special kind of grass. The lakes had bass and perch. In 1964 the $50,000 Houston Golf Classic was at the golf course. In 1976, the owners of the course had not made a payment on their $5 million mortgage in five years, leading to the course&#x27;s closure. The City of Houston proceeded to buy about two-thirds of the course two years later; real estate developers bought the rest of the course. The course is the home course of the Wisdom High School golf team; the school is about from the course.

The city operates the Sharpstown Green Park at 6300 Sharpview Drive. The city operates the Sharpstown Community Center at 6600 Harbor Town Drive.

Bonham Park, a city park, is in Sharpstown original Section 3. E. L. Crain Park, another city park, is in Sharpstown Country Club Terrace Section 3. Lansdale Park is in Country Club Terrace Section 2.

Sharpstown has a little league called Sharpstown Little League that plays at Bayland Park.

In 2007, the group Neighborhood Centers Inc. announced that it would build the Gulfton Neighborhood Campus at the intersection of Rookin Street and High Star Drive when it raises $20 million. The Baker-Ripley Neighborhood Center opened in 2010 and now offers a wide range of services including after school programs, a medical clinic, financial center, fitness classes, and ESL.

Sharpstown Junior-Senior High School opened in 1968; the high school split and moved to its own campus in 1969. In February 1995 Sugar Grove, built in former church property, opened as a relief school. Sands Point opened in 1998 as a relief school for Emerson, Piney Point, and Walnut Bend. Repairs and renovations of Sugar Grove were completed by January 1999. In the early 2000s (decade), the areas north of Sands Point Drive were zoned to Sharpstown Middle School; at a later point they were rezoned to Revere. Sharpview Elementary School was temporarily established at 7734 Mary Bates in order to relieve some Sharpstown-area elementary schools; Sharpview opened fall 2000 and closed in spring 2004. Sugar Grove received a grades 5–6 attendance boundary in 2009.

The new 6–12 school took attendance boundaries from Lee High School (now Wisdom High School) and Sharpstown High School, while Sugar Grove Middle School took portions of the boundary from Sharpstown Middle School. As of 2012, Sharpstown International School now has no boundary, with Sugar Grove Middle School and Sharpstown High School controlling its former middle and high school boundaries.

<text>Lyot is a large lunar impact crater that is located along the southeastern limb of the Moon. It lies within the irregular and patchy lunar mare named Mare Australe, and to the south of the crater Hamilton. Due to its location, this formation is viewed at a low angle from the Earth, and its visibility is affected by libration.

The interior floor of this crater has been resurfaced by lava, leaving a dark interior with an albedo that matches the surrounding mare. The outer rim is low and heavily worn, with a perimeter that forms a somewhat distorted circle. The southwest part of the floor and rim is marked by several small, bowl-shaped craters. There is also the remains of a ghost crater to the east of the crater midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lyot.

<text>Newtown is a part of the Municipality of New-Wes-Valley, located at the North end of Bonavista Bay in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The approximate population is 400. Settlement in Newtown originated around 1850 when people relocated from nearby areas. Newtown is well known for being built on many small islands, and is the home of the Barbour Living Heritage Village.

==History==
Newtown was once known as Inner Pinchard&#x27;s Island or Inner Islands because of its close proximity to Pinchard&#x27;s Island, where most of Newtown&#x27;s settlers first came from. The first family names recorded in Newtown were the Blackmores, Halls, and Norris&#x27;. Newtown was combined with Pinchard&#x27;s Island in the Newfoundland &quot;Census&quot; until the 1874 &quot;Census&quot;. In 1884 there were 382 people living in Newtown, mainly working in the Labrador fishery and the seal fishery. In 1892 the operator of the local lobster factory, John Haddon, announced the community was changing its name to Newtown. However, the name of the post office remained Inner Islands until 1903. With the collapse of the Labrador fishery in the 1930s, the population began to decline. The population in 1921 was 632 but by 1940 it was almost half, at 359. After several years and with people leaving smaller nearby areas, many people moved to Newtown and the population began to grow again. In 1992 the community of Newtown amalgamated with Wesleyville and Badger&#x27;s Quay-Valleyfield-Pool&#x27;s Island.

==Church history==
A Church of England school-chapel was built by 1880 in Newtown and a Methodist school-chapel opened in 1885. In 1884 124 of the 382 people in Newtown were Methodist, in 1889 there were 160 Methodists and by 1921 there were 275 Methodists. St.Luke&#x27;s Church of England church was consecrated in Newtown in 1895, and Newtown became the center of church life for surrounding communities with the establishment of the Methodist circuit there in 1912.

==Education history==
The first record of schooling in Newtown was with a Mrs. Collins, who kept a school for those who could not go to Pinchard&#x27;s Island, in 1878. A Church of England school-chapel was constructed in 1889 and a Methodist one by 1885.

==The Barbour Family==
Two of the early Barbers/Barbours in Newfoundland, George (1746–1818) and Joseph (1751–1818) Barbour arrived in Greenspond sometime prior to 1792, and later settled on Cobbler&#x27;s Island after 1809. Joseph&#x27;s son Benjamin Barbour (1808–1891) had eleven children. Five of them, Joseph, William, Thomas, George and James, were well-known sealing captains. Edward and Samuel formed the &quot;E&amp;S Barbour&quot; firm. The Barbours came to Newtown in the early 1870s, upon which time some of them became sealing captains. The first was Captain Joe Barbour (1842–1890) and the most prominent being Captain George Barbour (1858–1928). George Barbour was born on Cobbler&#x27;s Island and his first steamer was the &quot;Walrus&quot; in 1893, and his last was the &quot;Beothic II&quot; in 1928. Although Captain George Barbour had many successes, he was also faced with some tragedy. The &quot;Greenland Disaster&quot; of 1898 cost the lives of several of George Barbours men. The names of those men from Pinchard&#x27;s Island and Newtown were: George Bungay, James Cheeks, Isaac Green, George Norris, Herbert Norris, Walter Norris, Kenneth Parsons, and Henry Curtis.

Because of Benjamin Barbour and Sons and E&amp;S Barbour firm (established 1893), Newtown became an important mercantile center. The Barbour family of Newtown, through their efforts and successes, brought much to the community of Newtown in its early years and continues to do so today. The Barbour House in Newtown was constructed in 1874 by Benjamin Barbour, a schooner-owner and master-mariner. It has 32 rooms and is an important tourist attraction in Newtown today.

==Census information==
**The 1869 &quot;Census&quot; includes both Pinchard&#x27;s Island and Inner Island (Newtown). Newtown appears in the 1874 &quot;Census&quot; as Pinchard&#x27;s Island Inner Tickles.

==Directory information==
- Newtown appears in Lovell&#x27;s Directory for 1871 as &quot;Inner Islands&quot; and is described as a group of islands on the north side of Bonavista Bay which is difficult to access. It is distant from Greenspond by 10 miles in boat and has a population of 141. The names listed are:
*Benjamin Barbour, Planter
*Patrick Blackmore, Fisherman
*William Bungey, Fisherman

<text>Maupertuis is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies in the stretch of rugged terrain north of Sinus Iridum, a bay in the northwestern corner of Mare Imbrium. To the north lies the crater La Condamine, and Mare Frigoris.

This is a crater that has been nearly obliterated by a history of impacts, leaving only a disintegrated remnant of the original rim. The surviving outer rim is not especially circular, having been reshaped into a somewhat pentagonal outline. There are deep gouges from cratering along the northeastern rim. The interior floor is not in much better shape, being rough and irregular.

To the northeast of this crater is a system of rilles designated Rimae Maupertuis. These are considered to have formed through geological activity. Good eyesight and a large telescope are required to observe these rilles.

The crater was named for the French mathematician and astronomer Pierre Louis Maupertuis (1698–1759).

Maupertuis is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

<text>The Shelby Dakota is a limited-production performance version of the Dodge Dakota Sport pickup truck. Offered by Shelby for 1989 only, it was his first rear-wheel drive vehicle in many years, and his first production pickup truck.

The Shelby Dakota started with a short-wheelbase, short-bed, standard-cab, Sport package pickup. The 3.9 L V6 producing was replaced by a 5.2 L V8 with throttle-body injection. The tight space in the Dakota&#x27;s engine compartment necessitated removing the engine-driven fan in front and using a pair of electric ones instead. Removing the belt-driven fan increased the stock 5.2 L V8&#x27;s output by . With that, the Shelby Dakota produced at 4000 rpm and of torque at 2000 rpm, with a redline at 4,750 rpm. The only transmission option was a 4-speed automatic, and the truck featured a 3.90:1 limited slip differential. When tested by &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, the Shelby Dakota clocked a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of 8.5 seconds and a quarter mile time of 15.6 seconds.

The Shelby Dakotas featured special graphics, wheels, blacked out trim, wheelarch extensions, a sports bar behind the cab and a front air dam with integrated fog lamps. On the interior, they also featured a Shelby steering wheel, seat inserts, and floormats, and individually numbered dash plaques.

Total production was 1,500; 860 in red and 540 in white. List price was $15,813 plus freight.

Dodge later introduced a high-performance version of the second-generation Dakota in 1998 with the Dakota R/T. Though lacking Shelby involvement, it similarly featured performance and appearance upgrades over the standard Dakota Sport, including special wheels and tires, better suspension components, and a larger, more powerful V8 engine.

<text>Gunnar Axel Arvid Nilsson (20 November 1948 – 20 October 1978) was a Swedish racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nilsson won the 1977 Belgian Grand Prix with Lotus.

Born and raised in Helsingborg, Nilsson initially studied engineering at Stockholm University and served as a submarine radio officer in the Swedish Navy. Nilsson began his racing career in the late 1960s, progressing into Formula Super Vee in 1973 with Ecurie Bonnier. His junior formulae career culminated in his victory at the 1975 British Formula 3 Championship, in only his second season of Formula Three racing. Nilsson signed for Lotus in , making his Formula One debut at the . Qualifying for every race in his rookie season, Nilsson scored podium finishes in Spain and Austria. Retaining his seat for , Nilsson scored his maiden win at the , with a further podium at the .

Having signed to Arrows for , Nilsson was diagnosed with testicular cancer in December 1977, experiencing a rapid decline in health prior to his death 10 months later. Outside of Formula One, Nilsson was a race-winner in both the World Sportscar and European Touring Car Championships with BMW. The Gunnar Nilsson Memorial Trophy was held in 1979, won by Alan Jones.

==Early life==
Gunnar Axel Arvid Nilsson was born on 20 November 1948 in Helsingborg, the second son of a local building contractor. He attended school in his home town and went into the service as a submarine radio officer in the Swedish Navy. After leaving the navy, he studied engineering for four years at Stockholm University and gained a degree. It was hoped he would join the family business, but after eight months working as a supervisor in the construction industry; he left to start his own business.

Although his background and training was in construction, this held no attraction to the young Swede. Together with his associate, Dan Molim, they aimed to establish a transport business. This proved to be very successful and Nilsson continued to be a partner in the company, even when he became a full-time driver. He had seen the exploits of fellow Swedes; Ronnie Peterson and Reine Wisell and knew he wanted to be a racing driver.

==Junior formulae==
Nilsson began racing in national events in Sweden, in the late 1960s. It was 1972, when he acquired a RPB Formula Vee car and set forth to learn the trade. This first season in Formula Vee saw him race just ten times, and included one race win at Mantorp Park. At the age of 26, he decided to try his hand and raced in Formula Super Vee series in 1973, with Ecurie Bonnier. Driving a Lola T252 alongside his teammate Freddy Kottulinsky, he would learn many valuable lessons from this seasoned campaigner. In his first race though, Nilsson finished third, and after a string of good performances, he finished fifth in the championship. He was clearly good as he stepped up to Formula Two, and promptly finished fourth in the Norisring-Trophäe, at the Norisring, in a Team Pierre Robert entered GRD-Ford 273, mainly due to misfortunes of others. One of these lessons learnt was that if he wanted to race at the top and with the best, his next step would be in Formula Three. It was while racing at Nürburgring that he was approached by Västkust-Stugan, who offered sponsorship for 1974.

==Formula Three/Formula Atlantic==
With Västkust-Stugan help, a March 743 was acquired along with a Toyota engine. This would enable Nilsson to contest the Polifac Formula Three Championship. The results were as good as expected. He did score some second places, but victories and the season was punctuated by many spins and minor accidents. Nilsson did not go unnoticed and towards the middle of the season, he was given a drive with Team Västkuststugan, in their F2 March-BMW 732. Later in the season, he got another opportunity with Brian Lewis Racing, in their F2 March-BMW 732, where he did scored a fourth place in the second heat of the Preis von Baden-Württemberg und Hessen, at Hockenheim. This strong form in the German Formula Three series earned him a works March ride in the British series in 1975.

With the advantage of adequate pre-season testing and growing self-confidence, Nilsson scored his first F3 win in the season-opener at Thruxton. This was the catalyst for run of success that would see him win the B.A.R.C. BP Super Visco British F3 Championship, and included wins at Aintree, Ring Knutstorp, Snetterton and Silverstone. In winning the F3 support race at the British Grand Prix meeting, partly from winning the FOCA Trophy, he attracted the attention of Ted Moore of Rapid Movements Ltd., who signed Nilsson to race their Formula Atlantic Chevron. Gunnar had interspersed his success with some spectacular accidents, but with Ted Moore, he made no mistakes. Following a fourth place in his first Atlantic race, he would win the next five, four from pole position.

His F3 and Formula Atlantic performances earned him a test in a Formula One car, driving a Williams FW03 at Goodwood at the end of the 1975 season. He impressed and was offered a contract for 1976, but turned it down in favour of an F2 drive with March which did not require a budget. However, after just one Grand Prix for Lotus, Nilsson&#x27;s countryman Peterson decided he wanted to drive for March in Formula One. As part of this deal, March offered Nilsson to Lotus, where he joined Bob Evans, another new signing in the team to help develop their new car, Lotus 77.

==Grand Prix years==
In all his Grands Prix, Nilsson only drove for Colin Chapman and his Team Lotus. He got his chance with the famous marque when Jacky Ickx and Ronnie Peterson abandoned ship when the Lotus 76 proved a disastrous replacement for the legendary Lotus 72. The replacement car for 1976, Lotus 77 was promising, meanwhile the team was undergoing big change at the time and Mario Andretti soon replaced Evans, the team was soon back on the way up, with Nilsson taking advantage of Andretti&#x27;s experience.

Following Peterson&#x27;s departure, Nilsson was thrown in at the deep end – racing the Lotus-Cosworth 77 in the South African Grand Prix. His debut was not an auspicious one; he qualified last of 25 drivers, in what was attributed to a bad car, which had caught fire during practice. The next was the non-championship, Race of Champions at Brands Hatch. This was more promising: he started from the second row of the grid and stormed into an immediate lead. However, his race only lasted to lap six, when the Cosworth DFV shed a plug lead. Before the other English non-championship race, the BRDC International Trophy, there was the small matter of the US GP West, around the street of Long Beach, California. He had survived a huge first turn accident, only for his rear suspension to break half a lap later, pitching him into the wall at 160 mph.

His debut season saw a podium finish at only his third Grand Prix, the Gran Premio de España. He also scored another impressive third place in the Grand Prix von Österreich, fifth in Germany and sixth in Japan, but the rest of the season was marred by accidents – in Belgium, Sweden, and Holland – and by car failures – in Monaco, France, England, and at Watkins Glen.

For 1977, Lotus retained Nilsson alongside Andretti, and the pair worked on developing the new ground-effect Lotus 78. After a slow start to the season, as Andretti took over his car for the Argentine Grand Prix, Nilsson really got going at Jarama with a 5th place. Two races later, he took a magnificent win at the rain-soaked Zolder. As the race progressed, and the track dried, Nilsson suffered from a vibrating wheel nut, therefore he made a stop to have a tyre change. On these new tyres, he drove around the outside of Niki Lauda&#x27;s Ferrari with 20 laps to go, to take the lead and stayed ahead to take victory. With further good results at Dijon-Prenois (4th) and Silverstone (3rd) Nilsson climbed the Championship standings. Come Autumn, his performance was blighted by poor qualifying efforts and there was a sudden downturn in his performances, retiring from all the last seven rounds of the Grand Prix season.

His last appearance in a Formula One car, was at Fuji, where he drove an Imperial-liveried Lotus 78. Nilsson&#x27;s last race was a lacklustre performance. Towards the end of the season, Nilsson&#x27;s relationship with Chapman deteriorated to some extent, and with Peterson having signed to return to Team Lotus, he was on the way out at Lotus. By now, he was already experiencing symptoms of cancer. He would finish the season in eighth place with a total of twenty points. He might have scored more points but for a whole catalogue of accidents.

Nilsson signed to race for Arrows in 1978, in their debut season, but as it happened he did not have the health required to drive the car, and was forced to stand down before the first race. Rolf Stommelen was signed to replace him instead. As Nilsson got weaker, Andretti and Peterson raced to the World Championship.

==Away from Formula One==

Nilsson was versatile; having driven a BMW saloon in both the World Championship for Makes and European Touring Car Championship in 1976 and 1977. For 1977, he joined Dieter Quester in a BMW-Alpina to contest a limited-numbered of races, taking the BMW 3.0 CSL to victory at Salzburgring and Nürburgring.

Nilsson briefly sampled American style oval racing in the International Race of Champions series, scoring a fifth at Michigan in September 1977. A month later, he followed this with two sixth places at Riverside, and expressed plenty of enthusiasm for this form of racing.

==Cancer==
In December 1977, during a routine check-up with a London doctor, Nilsson was informed he had cancer. From then on, he experienced a rapid decline in health. At the Charing Cross Hospital, London, Nilsson was treated for his cancer by intensive radiotherapy. By July 1978, he was almost unrecognisable, having lost over 30 kg in weight and all his hair, but he still talked of a possible comeback. But the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes.

After resigning from Arrows, he dedicated his remaining months on founding and running the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Foundation, linked to Charing Cross Hospital, declining pain-killing drugs so he could work as long as possible. His death came just five weeks after that of fellow Swede, rival and friend, Ronnie Peterson, who died from complications to injuries suffered in a crash at Monza. Peterson&#x27;s death deeply affected Nilsson, who attended the funeral. He returned to the Charing Cross hospital where five weeks later, on 20 October 1978, he died due to his testicular cancer.

According to his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;His rare talent had taken him swiftly to the top as No. 2 to Mario Andretti&quot; &quot;[and] he was perhaps the most naturally gifted of the new generation of grands prix drivers&quot;.

==Personality==
Those who knew Nilsson described him as a warm, energetic character with a love of life. His enthusiasm and confidence made him naturally persuasive, which F3 teammate Alex Ribeiro attributed to helping him progress in his early career. Even in later years as his condition worsened in hospital, he was an entertaining character to medical staff and convinced them to break certain rules for him, such as placing a telephone in his room.

Despite this outwardly friendly persona, Nilsson&#x27;s true character was complex. He could become quite solitary and would sometimes detach himself from social situations, so that few people became truly close to him. His contemporaries attributed this to the lack of a father figure in his life, Nilsson&#x27;s father having died when he was young.

Nilsson grew particularly close to Danny Sullivan after racing together in F3, eventually sharing a flat in London. The friendship continued and Sullivan was among those attending to his increasing needs toward the end of his life. He formed a strong student/teacher relationship with Lotus teammate Mario Andretti, who regarded Nilsson as his first true friend among racing drivers. He learnt from Andretti during their two years together, but inevitably felt the need to establish himself as a driver in his own right – this played a part in his decision to sign with Arrows for 1978.

<doc id="1213860" wikidata="Q5952542" url="?curid=1213860" title="Japanese pitch accent">
<text>Japanese [[pitch accent]] is a feature of the Japanese language that distinguishes words by accenting particular morae in most Japanese dialects. The nature and location of the accent for a given word may vary between dialects. For instance, the word for &quot;river&quot; is in the Tokyo dialect, with the accent on the second mora, but in the Kansai dialect it is . A final or is often devoiced to or after a downstep and an unvoiced consonant.

The Japanese term is , and it refers to pitch accent in languages such as Japanese and Swedish. It contrasts with , which refers to stress. An alternative term is which contrasts with .


==Standard Japanese==
Normative pitch accent, essentially the pitch accent of the Tokyo Yamanote dialect, is considered essential in jobs such as broadcasting. The current standards for pitch accent are presented in special accent dictionaries for native speakers such as the &quot;Shin Meikai Nihongo Akusento Jiten&quot; () and the &quot;NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Akusento Jiten&quot; (). Newsreaders and other speech professionals are required to follow these standards.

Foreign learners of Japanese are often not taught to pronounce the pitch accent, though it is included in some noted texts, such as &quot;&quot;. Incorrect pitch accent is a strong characteristic of a &quot;foreign accent&quot; in Japanese.

===Scalar pitch===
In standard Japanese, pitch accent has the following effect on words spoken in isolation:
#The following accent types are collectively known as &quot;kifukushiki&quot; (literally, &quot;rise-and-fall&quot;):
## If the accent is on the first mora, then the pitch starts high, drops suddenly on the second mora, then levels out. The pitch may fall across both morae, or mostly on one or the other (depending on the sequence of sounds)—that is, the first mora may end with a high falling pitch, or the second may begin with a (low) falling pitch, but the first mora will be considered accented regardless. The Japanese describe this as &quot;atamadakagata&quot; (literally, &quot;head-high&quot;).
## If the accent is on a mora other than the first or the last, then the pitch has an initial rise from a low starting point, reaches a near-maximum at the accented mora, then drops suddenly on any following morae. This accent is referred to as &quot;nakadakagata&quot; (&quot;middle-high&quot;).
## If the word has an accent on the last mora, the pitch rises from a low start up to a high pitch on the last mora. Words with this accent are indistinguishable from accentless words unless followed by a particle such as &quot;ga&quot; or &quot;ni&quot;, on which the pitch drops. In Japanese this accent is called &quot;odakagata&quot; (&quot;tail-high&quot;).
# If the word does not have an accent, the pitch rises from a low starting point on the first mora or two, and then levels out in the middle of the speaker&#x27;s range, without ever reaching the high tone of an accented mora. In Japanese this accent is named &quot;flat&quot; ( &quot;heibanshiki&quot;).

Note that accent rules apply to phonological words, which include any following particles. So the sequence &quot;&quot;hashi&quot; spoken in isolation can be accented in two ways, either &quot;háshi&quot; (accent on the first syllable, meaning &#x27;chopsticks&#x27;) or &quot;hashí&quot; (flat or accent on the second syllable, meaning either &#x27;edge&#x27; or &#x27;bridge&#x27;), while &quot;hashi&quot; plus the subject-marker &quot;ga&quot;&quot; can be accented on the first syllable or the second, or be flat/accentless: &quot;háshiga&quot; &#x27;chopsticks&#x27;, &quot;hashíga&quot; &#x27;bridge&#x27;, or &quot;hashiga&quot; &#x27;edge&#x27;.

In poetry, a word such as &quot;omoshirói&quot;, which has the accent on the fourth mora &quot;ro&quot;, is pronounced in five beats (morae). When initial in the phrase (and therefore starting out with a low pitch), the pitch typically rises on the &quot;o&quot;, levels out at mid range on the &quot;moshi&quot;, peaks on the &quot;ro&quot;, and then drops suddenly on the &quot;i&quot;, producing a falling tone on the &quot;roi&quot;.

In all cases but final accent, there is a general declination (gradual decline) of pitch across the phrase. This, and the initial rise, are part of the prosody of the phrase, not lexical accent, and are larger in scope than the phonological word. That is, within the overall pitch-contour of the phrase there may be more than one phonological word, and thus potentially more than one accent.

===Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts===
An &quot;accent nucleus&quot; (アクセント核 &quot;akusento kaku&quot;) or &quot;accent locus&quot; is another name for an accented mora, a mora that carries a high tone and is followed by a mora with a low tone. In other words, the precipitous drop in pitch occurs right at the boundary between the accent nucleus and the mora immediately after it. Unaccented words (of the &quot;heiban&quot; type) do not have an accent nucleus.

Unlike regular morae or 自立拍 (&quot;jiritsu haku&quot; &quot;autonomous beats&quot;), defective morae or 特殊拍 (&quot;tokushu haku&quot; &quot;special beats&quot;) cannot generally be accent nuclei. They historically arose through various processes that limited their occurrences and prominence in terms of accent-carrying capability. There are four types of them:
*The : derived from Middle Chinese coda consonants (/n/ and /m/) (e.g.: /kaN/; /wemu/ &gt; /eN/), but also arose naturally through &quot;onbin&quot; (e.g.: /yomite/ &gt; /yoNde/)
*The : mainly arose through &quot;onbin&quot; (e.g.: /katite/ &gt; /kaQte/) or through consonant assimilation (e.g.: /setpuku/ &gt; /seQpuku/)
*The : arose through consonant losses (e.g.: /kakasaN/ &gt; /kaRsaN/), vowel shifts or vowel assimilation during Late Middle Japanese (e.g.: /eu/ &gt; /joR/; /joũ/ &gt; /joR/)
*The morphologically bound /i/ (/I/, written in kana as い/イ): derived from a Middle Chinese offglide (e.g.: /taI/; /tuI/) or arose through &quot;onbin&quot; (e.g.: /kakisiro/ &gt; /kaIsiro/)

While the accent patterns of single words are often unpredictable, those of compounds are often rule-based. Take the suffix 市 (&quot;-shi&quot;), for example. When compounding with a place name to form a city name, the accent nucleus of the resulting compound is usually immediately before 市 itself:
*千葉 (&quot;Chiba&quot;): HꜜL &gt; 千葉市 (&quot;Chiba-shi&quot; &quot;Chiba City&quot;): L-HꜜL /tibaꜜsi/
But if the mora before 市 is defective, the accent must shift one mora backward:
*白山 (&quot;Hakusan&quot;): HꜜL-L-L &gt; 白山市 (&quot;Hakusan-shi&quot; &quot;Hakusan City&quot;): L-H-HꜜL-L /hakusaꜜNsi/
*西条 (&quot;Saijō&quot;): HꜜL-L-L &gt; 西条市 (&quot;Saijō-shi&quot; &quot;Saijō City&quot;): L-H-HꜜL-L /saIzjoꜜRsi/
*仙台 (&quot;Sendai&quot;): HꜜL-L-L &gt; 仙台市 (&quot;Sendai-shi&quot; &quot;Sendai City&quot;): L-H-HꜜL-L /seNdaꜜIsi/

A defective mora can be an accent nucleus only if the mora following it is also defective:
*ロンドンっ子 (&quot;Rondon-kko&quot; &quot;Londoner&quot;): L-H-H-HꜜL-L /roNdoNꜜQko/
*東京っ子 (&quot;Tōkyō-kko&quot; &quot;Tokyoite&quot;): L-H-H-HꜜL-L /toRkjoRꜜQko/
*現代っ子 (&quot;gendai-kko&quot; &quot;modern person&quot;): L-H-H-HꜜL-L /ɡeNdaIꜜQko/

====Compoundified compound nouns vs noncompoundified compound nouns====
In general, Japanese utterances can be syntactically split into discrete phrases (known in the Hashimoto school of grammar as ). For example, the utterance 母が料理をして父が皿を洗います (&quot;Haha-ga ryōri-o shite chichi-ga sara-o arai-masu&quot; &quot;My mother cooks and my father washes the dishes&quot;) can be subdivided into the following phrases:
*母が (&quot;haha-ga&quot;)
*料理を (&quot;ryōri-o&quot;)
*して (&quot;shite&quot;)
*父が (&quot;chichi-ga&quot;)
*皿を (&quot;sara-o&quot;)
*洗います (&quot;arai-masu&quot;)
The general structure of these phrases is that a syntactically free morpheme is followed by one or more syntactically bound morphemes. Free morphemes are nouns, adjectives and verbs, while bound morphemes are particles and auxiliaries. In the above utterance, the free morphemes are 母, 料理, して, 父, 皿, and 洗い while the bound ones are が, を and ます. The accent pattern of the entire utterance could be something like this:

Ideally, each phrase can carry at most one accent nucleus (in the above example, ha-ha-ga&quot;, ryo-o-ri-o&quot;, &quot;chi-chi-ga&quot; and &quot;a-ra-i-ma-su&quot;), and such accent nucleus is based solely on the lexical accent nucleus of the free morpheme of that phrase (bound morphemes do not have lexical accent patterns, and whatever accent patterns they do have is dependent on those of the free morphemes they follow). However, the situation becomes complicated when it comes to compound nouns.

When multiple independent nouns are placed successively, they syntactically form a compound noun. For example:
*第 (&quot;dai&quot;) + 一次 (&quot;ichiji&quot;) + 世界 (sekai) + 大戦 (&quot;taisen&quot;) &gt; 第一次世界大戦 (&quot;Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen&quot; &quot;World War I&quot;)
At the phrasal level, compound nouns are well contained within a phrase, no matter how long they are. Thus, the utterance ヨーロッパは第一次世界大戦では主戦場となった (&quot;Yōroppa-wa Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen-de-wa shusenjō-to natta&quot; &quot;Europe was the main theater of war in World War I&quot;) is subdivided into phrases as follows:
*ヨーロッパは (&quot;Yōroppa-wa&quot;)
*第一次世界大戦では (&quot;Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen-de-wa&quot;)
*主戦場と (&quot;shusenjō-to&quot;)
*なった (&quot;natta&quot;)
As &quot;Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen-de-wa&quot; is an entire phrase in itself, it should ideally carry at most one accent nucleus, the lexical accent nucleus of the free compound noun &quot;Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen&quot;. In actuality, &quot;Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen&quot;, as a compound noun, is capable of carrying more than one accent nucleus. While still being a syntactic compound, its components might not be solidly &quot;fused&quot; together and still retain their own lexical accent nuclei. Whether &quot;Dai-ichiji-Sekai-Taisen&quot; should have one nucleus of its own, or several nuclei of its constituents, is a matter of whether it is a &quot;compoundified compound noun&quot; (複合語化複合名詞 &quot;fukugōgoka fukugō meishi&quot;) or &quot;noncompoundified compound noun&quot; (非複合語化複合名詞 &quot;hifukugōgoka fukugō meishi&quot;). The &quot;compoundification&quot; status of a compound noun is lexical, meaning that whether such compound noun is long or short, or simple or complex, is not relevant to whether it is &quot;compoundified&quot; or not. A yojijukugo such as 世代交代 (&quot;sedai-kōtai&quot; &quot;change of generation&quot;) may be treated as &quot;compoundified,&quot; with a single accent nucleus:

Meanwhile, a different four-kanji compound noun, 新旧交代 (&quot;shinkyū-kōtai&quot; &quot;transition between the old and the new&quot;), is treated as &quot;noncompoundified&quot;, and retains the lexical accent nuclei of its constituents (in this case 新旧 and 交代):

Some compound nouns, such as 核廃棄物 (&quot;kaku-haikibutsu&quot; &quot;nuclear waste&quot;), can be, on a preferential basis, either &quot;compoundified&quot; or &quot;noncompoundified&quot;:

For &quot;noncompoundified&quot; compound nouns, which constituents should be allowed for may also vary. For example, the above 第一次世界大戦:

===Binary pitch===
The foregoing describes the actual pitch. In most guides, however, accent is presented with a two-pitch-level model. In this representation, each mora is either high (H) or low (L) in pitch, with the shift from high to low of an accented mora transcribed HꜜL. 
# If the accent is on the first mora, then the first syllable is high-pitched and the others are low: HꜜL, HꜜL-L, HꜜL-L-L, HꜜL-L-L-L, &quot;etc.&quot;
# If the accent is on a mora other than the first, then the first mora is low, the following morae up to and including the accented one are high, and the rest are low: L-Hꜜ, L-HꜜL, L-H-HꜜL, L-H-H-HꜜL, &quot;etc.&quot;
# If the word is &quot;heiban&quot; (accentless), the first mora is low and the others are high: L-H, L-H-H, L-H-H-H, L-H-H-H-H, &quot;etc.&quot; This high pitch spreads to unaccented grammatical particles that attach to the end of the word, whereas these would have a low pitch when attached to an accented word (including one accented on the final mora).

Phonetically, although only the terms &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; are used, the &quot;high&quot; of an unaccented mora is not as high as an accented mora. Different analyses may treat final-accented (&quot;odaka&quot;) words and unaccented (&quot;heiban&quot;) words as identical and only distinguishable by a following particle, or phonetically contrastive and potentially phonemic based on how high a &quot;high&quot; tone actually is (see the Tertiary pitch subsection below). And the phonetic tones are never truly stable, but degrade toward the end of an utterance. This is especially noticeable in longer words, where the so-called &quot;high&quot; pitch tapers off toward the end. This tapering is especially exemplified by what is variously known as &quot;downstep&quot;, &quot;downdrift&quot; or &quot;catathesis&quot;, where the &quot;high&quot; pitch of words becomes successively lower after each accented mora:

In slow and deliberate enunciation (for example, with a pause between elements), the &quot;high&quot; tone of the second element in these phrases could still be sufficiently &quot;high,&quot; but in natural, often pauseless, speech, it could become as low as the &quot;low&quot; tone of the first element, since there is an accented mora in that first element.

====Tertiary pitch====
Earlier phonologists made use of a three-tone system, with an additional &quot;mid&quot; tone (M). For example, 端 (&quot;hashi&quot; &quot;edge&quot;, &quot;heiban&quot;/unaccented) is considered to have a L-M pattern, while 橋 (&quot;hashi&quot; &quot;bridge&quot;, &quot;odaka&quot;/final-accented) is to have a L-H pattern. This contrast is supported by phonetic analyses, which show that the contrast in frequency between the &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; tones in, for example, 花 (&quot;hana&quot; &quot;flower&quot;, &quot;odaka&quot;/final-accented), is much starker than the contrast between the &quot;low&quot; and &quot;mid&quot; tones in 鼻 (&quot;hana&quot; &quot;nose&quot;, &quot;heiban&quot;/unaccented). Moreover, the &quot;high&quot; tone in final-accented words is phonetically higher than the &quot;mid&quot; tone in unaccented words. With respect to potential minimal pairs such as &quot;edge&quot; &quot;hashi&quot; vs &quot;bridge&quot; &quot;hashi&quot; and &quot;nose&quot; &quot;hana&quot; vs &quot;flower&quot; &quot;hana&quot;, the &quot;mid&quot; tone, in theory, should be considered phonemic, but it is now largely merged with the &quot;high&quot; tone as phonologists claim there are no perceptible differences in pitch pattern between a final-accented word (&quot;odaka&quot;) without a following particle and an unaccented word (&quot;heiban&quot;):
The &quot;mid&quot; tone also corresponds to what is now considered the &quot;low&quot; tone in initial-accented (&quot;atamadaka&quot;) and medial-accented (&quot;nakadaka&quot;) words:
===Initial lowering===
The tone of the first mora in non-initial-accented (non-&quot;atamadaka&quot;) words is often underspecified. Early versions of the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典 (&quot;NHK Nihongo Hatsuon Accent Shinjiten&quot; &quot;NHK Pronouncing Accent New Dictionary&quot;) always leave it unmarked. This is owing to how what is known as &quot;initial lowering&quot; is not universally applied in natural speech, thus making the tone of the first mora indefinite and dependent on the nature of the second mora:
*(1) If the second mora is a &quot;hatsuon&quot; or the lengthening half of a long vowel, the tone of the first mora is &quot;high&quot;, and there may or may not be initial lowering.
*(2) If the second mora is a &quot;sokuon&quot;, the tone of the first mora is &quot;low&quot;, and there is initial lowering, but the tone of the second mora is also &quot;low.&quot;
*(3) If the second mora is any other type of mora, the tone of the first mora is &quot;low&quot;, and there is initial lowering.
In the (1) circumstances, initial lowering does not naturally happen in connected speech, but it can still be artificially induced with the slow, deliberate enunciation of whatever word is of concern. Despite this, most educational material only considers the option with initial lowering and ignores the option without.

The following are illustrative examples of the indefinite pitch of the first mora. For monomoraic non-initial-accented words, the second mora is whatever particle that follows it.
===Accent patterns===
Most of the following patterns are listed in the and the .

====連用形====
According to the appendix アクセント to the &quot;Daijirin&quot;, here are the patterns for the 連用形 of monograde verbs without a trailing particle or auxiliary:
*くらべる → くらべꜜ or くらべ（比べ）
*しらべꜜる → しらꜜべ（調べ）
The derived noun from くらべる is くらべ (accentless). Also compare the 連用形 しらꜜべ (&quot;nakadaka&quot;) to its derived noun, しらべꜜ (&quot;odaka&quot;).

According to Timothy J. Vance (2008) and Shiro Kori (2020), here are the patterns for the 連用形 of pentagrade verbs without a trailing particle or auxiliary:
*のる → のり（乗り）
*はなꜜす → はなꜜし（話し）
*のꜜむ → のꜜみ（飲み）

Compare the 連用形 はなꜜし and のꜜみ (&quot;nakadaka&quot;) to their respective derived nouns, はなしꜜ and のみꜜ (&quot;odaka&quot;).

====Nouns derived from other parts of speech====

=====Nouns derived from single verbs=====
The accent of nouns derived from verbs is generally based on the accent of the dictionary forms of those verbs. If the dictionary form is accentless, the derived noun is also accentless:
*うく（浮く） → うき（浮き）
*かす（貸す） → かし（貸し）
*あれる（荒れる） → あれ（荒れ）
*そめる（染める） → そめ（染め）
*おわる（終わる） → おわり（終わり）
*たたむ（畳む） → たたみ（畳み）
*きこえる（聞こえる） → きこえ（聞こえ）
*みとめる（認める） → みとめ（認め）
*たたかう（戦う） → たたかい（戦い）
*うごく（働く） → うごき（働き）

If the dictionary form is accented, the derived noun has &quot;odaka&quot; accent, though certain derived nouns may alternatively have different accent types:
*くꜜむ（組む） → くみꜜ（組み）
*ふꜜる（降る） → ふりꜜ（降り）
*おちꜜる（落ちる） → おちꜜ（落ち）
*はじꜜる（恥じる） → はじꜜ（恥じ）
*はなꜜす（話す） → はなしꜜ（話し）
*ひかꜜる（光る） → ひかりꜜ（光り）
*かꜜえる（帰る） → かえりꜜ（帰り）
*とꜜおる（通る） → とおりꜜ（通り）
*たすけꜜる（助ける） → たすけꜜ（助け）
*つとめꜜる（勤める） → つとめꜜ（勤め）
*あつまꜜる（集まる） → あつまりꜜ or あつまꜜり（集まり）
*おどろꜜく（驚く） → おどろきꜜ or おどろꜜき（驚き）
*ことわꜜる（断る） → ことわりꜜ or ことわꜜり or ことわり（断り）

=====Nouns derived from compound verbs=====
Nouns derived from compound verbs tend to be accentless:
*にあꜜう（似合う） → にあい（似合い）
*しくꜜむ（仕組む） → しくみ（仕組み）
*いいあꜜう（言い合う） → いいあい（言い合い）
*うけとる or うけとꜜる（受け取る） → うけとり（受け取り）
*のりかえꜜる or のりかꜜえる（乗り換える） → のりかえ（乗り換え）
*ありあわせꜜる or ありあわせる（有り合わせる） → ありあわせ（有り合わせ）
*しのびなꜜく（忍び泣く） → しのびなき（忍び泣き）
*やけだされꜜる（焼け出される） → やけだされ（焼け出され）
*ゆずりわたꜜす（譲り渡す） → ゆずりわたし（譲り渡し）

=====&quot;-sa&quot; nouns derived from adjectives=====
&quot;-sa&quot; forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless:
*あまい（甘い） → あまさ（甘さ）
*おもい（重い） → おもさ（重さ）
*かたい（堅い） → かたさ（堅さ）
*つめたい（冷たい） → つめたさ（冷たさ）
*せいかく（正確） → せいかくさ（正確さ）

For accented dictionary forms with more than 2 morae, the accented location of the &quot;-sa&quot; forms is shifted back by 1 mora; OR, for non-&quot;-shii&quot; dictionary forms with more than 3 morae, the accented location may, alternative, not be shifted:
*よꜜい（良い） → よꜜさ（良さ）
*こꜜい（濃い） → こꜜさ（濃さ）
*わかꜜい（若い） → わꜜかさ（若さ）
*たかꜜい（高い） → たꜜかさ（高さ）
*うれしꜜい（嬉しい） → うれꜜしさ（嬉しさ）
*あたらしꜜい（新しい） → あたらꜜしさ（新しさ）
*するどꜜい（鋭い） → するꜜどさ or するどꜜさ（鋭さ）
*ありがたꜜい（有り難い） → ありがꜜたさ or ありがたꜜさ（有り難さ）

For &quot;-na&quot; adjectives, their roots&#x27; last mora is accented:
*おꜜろか（愚か） → おろかꜜさ（愚かさ）
*げꜜんき（元気） → げんきꜜさ（元気さ）

=====&quot;-mi&quot; nouns derived from adjectives=====
&quot;-mi&quot; forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives tend to also be accentless:
*あまい（甘い） → あまみ（甘み）
*おもい（重い） → おもみ（重み）
*あかるい（明るい） → あかるみ（明るみ）
*しんけん（真剣） → しんけんみ or しんけꜜんみ（真剣み）

For accented dictionary forms, unlike &quot;-sa&quot;, &quot;-mi&quot; often results in &quot;odaka&quot; accent, although for derived nouns with 4 or more morae, other accent types may also be found:
*にがꜜい（苦い） → にがみꜜ（苦み）
*しぶꜜい（渋い） → しぶみꜜ（渋み）
*おもしろꜜい（面白い） → おもしろみꜜ or おもしろꜜみ or おもしろみ（面白み）
*しꜜんせつ（親切） → しんせつみꜜ or しんせつꜜみ or しんせつみ（親切み）

=====&quot;-ke/ge&quot; nouns=====
&quot;-ke/ge&quot; forms derived from accentless dictionary forms of adjectives, nouns and verbs tend to also be accentless:
*ねむい（眠い） → ねむけ（眠気）
*あぶない（危ない） → あぶなげ or あぶなꜜげ（危な気）
*あぶら（油） → あぶらけ（油気）
*おとな（大人） → おとなげ（大人気）
For &quot;-ke/ge&quot; forms derived from accented dictionary forms, the results are often &quot;odaka&quot;, but if they contain more than 3 morae, they may be &quot;nakadaka&quot; instead:
*さむꜜい（寒い） → さむけꜜ（寒気）
*はꜜく（吐く） → はきけꜜ（吐き気）
*くꜜう（食う） → くいけꜜ（食い気）
*くるしꜜい（苦しい） → くるしꜜげ（苦し気）

====Nominal affixes====
Certain highly productive affixes, often of Sino-Japanese origin, often result in compound nouns with predictable accent patterns.

=====Prefixes=====
Productive Sino-Japanese prefixes such as 以（い）、各（かく）、貴（き）、現（げん）、故（こ）、今（こん）、諸（しょ）、先（せん）、前（ぜん）、尊（そん）、当（とう）、同（どう）、某（ぼう）、本（ほん）、両（りょう） often result in &quot;atamadaka&quot; compounds: しょꜜけい（諸兄）、かꜜくじん（各人）、とꜜうしゃ（当社）、どꜜうこう（同校）、ぼꜜうじょ（某女）、ぼꜜうじつ（某日）.

=====Short suffixes=====
For many native and Sino-Japanese suffixes, the accent falls on the last 自立拍 of the nouns before them. This means that if the last mora is a 特殊拍, the accent must shift backward until it reaches a 自立拍 (see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above).

=====Long suffixes=====
For native suffixes derived from free words with more than 2 morae, or native and Sino-Japanese suffixes derived from free words with 2 morphemes (often spelt with 2 kanji), if the original free words are accentless, &quot;odaka&quot; or &quot;atamadaka&quot;, the first mora of the derived suffixes is often accented:
*蛙（かえる・がえる） → とのさまがꜜえる（殿様蛙）

*神社（じꜜんじゃ） → かすがじꜜんじゃ（春日神社）
*料理（りょꜜうり） → せいようりょꜜうり（西洋料理）

For suffixes derived from free words with &quot;nakadaka&quot; accent, the tendency is to only keep the original accent of those free words, though some shifting may occur if the resulting compounds are very long:
*団扇（うちꜜわ） → ひだりうちꜜわ or ひだりうꜜちわ（左団扇）
*月夜（つきꜜよ・づきよ） → ほしづきꜜよ or ほしづꜜきよ（星月夜）

*試験（しけꜜん） → にゅうしゃしけꜜん（入社試験）
*委員会（いいꜜんかい） → きょういくいいꜜんかい（教育委員会）

=====Proper name suffixes=====
Some common proper name suffixes, such as 様（さま）、さん、ちゃん、殿（どの）、君（くん）, do not affect the names they suffix:
*なかむら + さま → なかむらさま
*やまꜜした + さま → やまꜜしたさま
*かꜜとう + さま → かꜜとうさま
*なかむら + さん → なかむらさん
*やまꜜした + さん → やまꜜしたさん
*かꜜとう + さん → かꜜとうさん
*まさお + ちゃん → まさおちゃん
*かずꜜひこ + ちゃん → かずꜜひこちゃん
*はꜜなこ + ちゃん → はꜜなこちゃん
*なかむら + どの → なかむらどの
*まさお + どの → まさおどの
*やまꜜした + どの → やまꜜしたどの
*かずꜜひこ + どの → かずꜜひこどの
*かꜜとう + どの → かꜜとうどの
*はꜜなこ + どの → はꜜなこどの
*なかむら + くん → なかむらくん
*かずꜜひこ + くん → かずꜜひこくん
*かꜜとう + くん → かꜜとうくん

氏（し） places the accent on the last mora of originally accentless names, but does not affect accented names:
*なかむら + し → なかむらꜜし
*まさお + し → まさおꜜし
*やまꜜした + し → やまꜜしたし
*かꜜとう + し → かꜜとうし

=====Particle-like suffixes=====
Some suffixes notably affect accentless and accented nouns differently, like a trailing particle:
*おれ + ら → おれꜜら → おꜜいら（俺等）
*かꜜれ + ら → かꜜれら（彼等）
*とり + たち → とりꜜたち（鳥達）
*ねꜜこ + たち → ねꜜこたち（猫達）
*とり + だらけ → とりだꜜらけ or とりだらけ（鳥だらけ）
*ねꜜこ + だらけ → ねこだꜜらけ（猫だらけ）

====Trailing particles and auxiliaries====
The lexical accents of words as shown in dictionaries may be modified if there is a trailing particle or auxiliary.

=====Noun+particle=====
The particles are categorized in four groups based on how they modify the accent of the nouns the follow.
*Group A: か、が、さ、だけ、で、と、に、は、へ、も、や、よ、を、から、きり、しか、ほど、として: These do not modify the nouns&#x27; accent at all. しか in particular may make an accentless noun&#x27;s last mora accented.
**は + しか → はしか or はꜜしか
**さくら + しか → さくらしか or さくらꜜしか
*Group B: の (sometimes reduced to ん): This particle only deaccents nouns with &quot;odaka&quot; accent and do not affect other nouns.
*Group C: ね、かな (doubtful)、かね: This group only affects accentless nouns (accentless).
*Group D: かい、かな (exclamatory)、こそ、さえ、しも、すら、だの、では、でも、とて、とも、など、なり、ねえ、のみ、まで、やら、ゆえ、より、かしら、くらい・ぐらい、だって、どころ、ばかり、なんか、なんて、よりか、よりも: This group also only affects accentless nouns. When trailing a accented noun, くらい・ぐらい and ばかり in particular may, alternatively, make the particle&#x27;s first mora accented:
**おかꜜし + ぐらい → おかꜜしぐらい or おかしぐꜜらい
**おかꜜし + ばかり → おかꜜしばかり or おかしばꜜかり
*Group E: だけ: This particle either deaccents in and of itself, or behaves like Group A.

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Noun ending in 特殊拍+の=====
The table above shows that the particle の does not affect certain &quot;nakadaka&quot; nouns. However, if a &quot;nakadaka&quot; noun ends in a special mora (特殊拍, see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above), の deaccents it just like it does an &quot;odaka&quot; noun.
*にほꜜん + の → にほんの（日本の）
*にっぽꜜん + の → にっぽんの（日本の）
*ちょうせꜜん + の → ちょうせんの（朝鮮の）
*きのꜜう + の → きのうの（昨日の）
*りゅうきゅꜜう + の → りゅうきゅうの（琉球の）

It has been argued that this behavior of these &quot;nakadaka&quot; nouns, coupled with that of &quot;odaka&quot; nouns, is proof that Japanese is a syllabic language rather than a moraic one, and syllables do indeed exist in Japanese, despite some objection such as Labrune (2012). These two groups of nouns can be classed as accented on the last syllable and deaccented if followed by の because (1) the &quot;odaka&quot; nouns end in a 自立拍, therefore their last &quot;syllable&quot; is accented and (2) the &quot;nakadaka&quot; nouns ends in a 自立拍 followed by a 特殊拍, therefore the last &quot;syllable&quot; is also accented. Here, the above examples are restated with added periods to denote &quot;syllabic&quot; boundaries, and with boldened last &quot;syllables&quot;:
*や.まꜜ + の → や.ま.の（山の）(&quot;odaka&quot;)
*や.す.みꜜ + の → や.す.み.の（休みの）(&quot;odaka&quot;)
*い.もう.とꜜ + の → い.もう.と.の（妹の）(&quot;odaka&quot;)
*ちょう.せꜜん + の → ちょう.せん.の（朝鮮の） (&quot;nakadaka&quot;)
*き.のꜜう + の → き.のう.の（昨日の） (&quot;nakadaka&quot;)
*りゅう.きゅꜜう + の → りゅう.きゅう.の（琉球の） (&quot;nakadaka&quot;)

=====Nominal &quot;odaka&quot; exception+の=====
Certain &quot;odaka&quot; nouns and &quot;nakadaka&quot; nouns ending in a 特殊拍, including ancient place names, are not deaccented by の.
*とさꜜ + の + くに → とさꜜのくに（土佐の国）
*みのꜜ + の + くに → みのꜜのくに（美濃の国）
*みかわꜜ + の + くに → みかわꜜのくに（三河の国）
*さがみꜜ + の + くに → さがみꜜのくに（相模の国）
*つぎꜜ + の → つぎꜜの（次の）
*よそꜜ + の → よそꜜの（余所の）
*ひゃくꜜ + の → ひゃくꜜの（百の）
*いっさつꜜ + の → いっさくꜜの（一冊の）
*えほꜜん + の → えほꜜんの（絵本の）
*せんせꜜい + の → せんせꜜいの（先生の）
*しけꜜん + の → しけꜜんの（試験の）
*せきたꜜん + の → せきたꜜんの（石炭の）
*にほんじꜜん + の → にほんじꜜんの（日本人の）
*ごにꜜん + の → ごにꜜんの（五人の）
*おおぜꜜい + の → おおぜꜜいの（大勢の）
*たくさꜜん + の → たくさꜜんの（沢山の）

=====Two noun phrases connected by の=====
According to Vance (2008), when two noun phrases are connected by の, if the first phrase is unaccented, the whole combination relies on the accent pattern of the second:
*ひろしま + の + + と → ひろしまのと（広島の卵と）
*ひろしま + の + + と → ひろしまのと（広島の卵と）

If the first phrase is accented, the two phrases likely remain separate, although downstep/downdrift/catathesis still applies and lowers the general pitch of the second phrase:
* + の + + と → の　と（岡山の卵と）
* + の + + と → の　と（岡山の卵と）

=====Noun+の+noun fixed phrases=====
As noted above, the particle の can remove accent from &quot;odaka&quot; nouns, and &quot;nakadaka&quot; nouns ending in a 特殊拍, resulting in a accentless phrase. Once the resulting noun+の phrase becomes accentless, when it is followed by another noun to form a fixed phrase, the second noun&#x27;s accent often takes precedence:
*つゆ + の → つゆの + → つゆの（梅雨の入り）
*みず + の → みずの + → みずの（水の泡）
*はちく + の → はちくの + → はちくの（破竹の勢い）
*はなꜜ + の → はなの + → はなの（花の都）
*つらꜜ + の → つらの + → つらの（面の皮）

On the other hand, as の cannot remove accent from other &quot;nakadaka&quot; nouns, and &quot;atamadaka&quot; nouns, the resulting noun+の remains accented, and its accent often takes precedence:
* + の → + むし → むし（芸の虫）
* + の → + さꜜち → さち（海の幸）
* + の → + いえꜜ → いえ（海の家）
* + の → + ひꜜ → ひ（母の日）

Although these &quot;rules&quot; are still overidden in many other fixed phrases:
* + の + ひꜜ → のひ（父の日）
* + の + こ → のこ（男の子）
* + の + こ → のこ（女の子）
* + の + ゆꜜ → のゆ（茶の湯）
*あꜜさ + の + → あさの（朝の内）
*めꜜ + の + → めの（目の敵）
*うめ + の + きꜜ → うめのꜜき（梅の木）
*ふくꜜ + の + かꜜみ → ふくのꜜかみ（福の神）

=====Noun with devoiced accentless mora followed by accented mora+の=====
If the accented mora of a &quot;odaka&quot; noun, or a noun ending in a special mora (特殊拍) as mentioned above, is preceded by a devoiced mora (voiceless consonant + &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; + voiceless consonant), and that noun may not be deaccented by の.
*ききꜜ + の + ときꜜ → ききꜜのとき（危機の時）
*ひしょꜜ + の + ひと → ひしょꜜのひと（秘書の人）
*ふきꜜ + の + きゃく → ふきꜜのきゃく（不帰の客）
*しきꜜん + の + ふそく → しきꜜんのふそく（資金の不足）
*ふきꜜん + の + ひと → ふきꜜんのひと（付近の人）
*きかꜜい + の + はなしꜜ → きかꜜいのはなし（機械の話）
*ちちꜜ + の + きゃく → ちちのきゃく or ちちꜜのきゃく（父の客）
*きしゃꜜ + の + なꜜか → きしゃのなꜜか or きしゃꜜのなか（汽車の中）

=====Noun+auxiliary=====
Auxiliaries can be categorized into four groups:
*Group a: だ: This auxiliary inherits the accent of the nouns.
*Group b: です、みたい: This group only affects the accent of accentless nouns (accentless).
**A phrase with a accented noun followed by みたい in particular may alternatively have two accent nuclei:
***はꜜる + みたい → はꜜるみたい or はꜜる　みꜜたい（春みたい）
***みずうꜜみ + みたい → みずうꜜみみたい or みずうꜜみ　みꜜたい（湖みたい）
*Group c: だろう、でしょう、らしい: This group also only affects the accent of accentless nouns.
*Group d: らしい: This auxiliary may affect all nouns, or only accentless nouns (Group c).

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Attributive phrase+noun+particle/auxiliary=====
When certain accentless nouns (accentless), such as 日（ひ）, 上（うえ）, 下（した）, 家（うち）, 人（ひと）, 所（ところ）, etc. are attributively modified by another accentless or &quot;odaka&quot; word and simultaneously followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent of the entire phrase may fall on the last mora of such nouns. Some examples include:
*こんな + ひ + に → こんなひꜜに（こんな日に）
*あくる + ひ + は → あくるひꜜは（あくる日は）
*あくる + ひ + だ → あくるひꜜだ（あくる日だ）
*やま + の + うえ + に → やまのうえꜜに（山の上に）
*やま + の + うえ + です → やまのうえꜜです（山の上です）
*やなぎ + の + した + に → やなぎのしたꜜに（柳の下に）
*となり + の + うち + から → となりのうちꜜから（隣の家から）
*となり + の + うち + だ → となりのうちꜜだ（隣の家だ）
*おとこꜜ + の + ひと + が → おとこのひとꜜが（男の人が）
*おとこꜜ + の + ひと + です → おとこのひとꜜです（男の人です）
*おなじ + ところ + へ → おなじところꜜへ（同じ所へ）

=====Adverbial+particle/auxiliary=====
When an accentless adverbial (accentless) is followed by a particle or an auxiliary, the accent falls on the last mora of that adverbial (even if that adverbial already contains a particle to begin with).
*これから + は → これからꜜは
*これから + だ → これからꜜだ
*あれだけ + は → あれだけꜜは
*これきり + に → これきりꜜに
*これきり + です → これきりꜜです
*きっと + か → きっとꜜか
*きっと + だ → きっとꜜだ
*まったく + です → まったくꜜです

=====Noun vs greeting=====
Greetings have different accent patterns from the nouns they derive from. Here, the original noun phrases are on the left of the arrows.
*ただꜜいま → ただいまꜜ（只今）
*こꜜんにちは → こんにちはꜜ（今日は）
*こꜜんばんは → こんばんはꜜ（今晩は）

=====Verbal 連用形+particle=====
Four groups of particles that can follow the 連用形 of verbs:
*Group F: て・で
*Group G: さえ、たり・だり、つつ、ては・では、ても・でも、てよ・でよ
*Group H: は、さえ、つつ、に
*Group I: ながら

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Verbal dictionary form+particle=====
Five groups of particles that can follow the dictionary forms of verbs:
*Group J: が (case)、と、な (exclamatory)、に、は、も、よ、を、きり、しか、だけ、ほど、ものの
*Group K: ぜ、ぞ、ね
*Group L: さえ、すら、とか、とて、とも、なあ、ねえ、のみ、まで、ゆえ、より、かな (exclamatory)、くらい・ぐらい、どころ、ばかり、よりか、よりも. くらい・ぐらい and ばかり behave similarly to when they follow nouns.
*Group M: か、が (case, conjunctive)、さ、し、ぜ、ぞ、と (quotative, parallel)、な (prohibitive)、に、の、は、も、や、を、かい、かな (doubtful)、かね、から、しか、すら、だの、とか、とて、とも、など、なり、ので・んで、のに、やら、より、わよ、かしら、けれど、なんて、よりか、よりも、けれども
*Group N: だけ. Also behaves like Group J.

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Verbal 仮定形+particle=====
Group O consists of ど、ば、ども. When these particles follow the 仮定形 of a accentless verb, the last mora of such form is accented:
*いれꜜば（居れば）
*はれれꜜば（腫れれば）
*くらべれꜜば（比べれば）
*もちいれꜜば（用いれば）
*かんじれꜜば（感じれば）
*かんずれꜜば（感ずれば）
*すれꜜば
*なれꜜば（鳴れば）
*あらえꜜば（洗えば）
*おこなえꜜば（行えば）

For accented verbs, no accent shift occurs:
*いꜜれば（射れば）
*はれꜜれば（晴れれば）
*しらべꜜれば（調べれば）
*しんじꜜれば（信じれば）
*しんずꜜれば（信ずれば）
*かすꜜれば or かꜜせば（課すれば or 課せば）

*いろꜜ（居ろ）
*はれろꜜ（腫れろ）
*くらべろꜜ（比べろ）
*もちいろꜜ（用いろ）
*かんじろꜜ（感じろ）
*しろꜜ
*なれꜜ（鳴れ）
*おこなえꜜ（行え）

For the written 命令形 of monograde verbs with accentless accent, whose root contains only 1 mora, the last mora is also accented; or alternatively, the penultimate mora is:
*いよꜜ or いꜜよ（居よ）

For the written 命令形 of monograde and &quot;-suru&quot; verbs with accentless accent, whose root contains more than 1 mora, the penultimate mora is accented:
*はれꜜよ（腫れよ）
*くらべꜜよ（比べよ）
*もちいꜜよ or もちꜜいよ（用いよ）
*かんじꜜよ（感じよ）
*かんぜꜜよ（感ぜよ）
*せꜜよ

For spoken and written 命令形 of verbs with accented accent, the location of the accented mora is the same as that in the dictionary forms:
*いꜜろ（射ろ）
*いꜜよ（射よ）
*しらべꜜろ（調べろ）
*しらべꜜよ（調べよ）
*しんじꜜろ（信じろ）
*しんじꜜよ（信じよ）

*こꜜい（来い）
*なꜜれ（成れ）
*かꜜえれ（帰れ）
*ならꜜえ（習え）
*てつだꜜえ（手伝え）

For the written 命令形 of monograde and &quot;-suru&quot; verbs with accented accent, whose root contains more than 1 mora, the location of the accented mora could, alternatively, be shifted back by up to 2 morae, until it reaches an independent mora (自立拍, see #Accent nuclei, defective morae and compound-induced accent shifts above):
*しらべꜜよ → しらꜜべよ（調べよ）
*しんじꜜよ → *しんꜜじよ → しꜜんじよ（信じよ）
*しんぜꜜよ → *しんꜜぜよ → しꜜんぜよ（信ぜよ）

Group P consists of と、や、よ. These particles do not alter the accent of the 命令形:
*いろꜜ + よ → いろꜜよ（居ろよ）
*はれろꜜ + よ → はれろꜜよ（腫れろよ）
*くらべろꜜ + よ → くらべろꜜよ（比べろよ）
*もちいろꜜ + よ → もちいろꜜよ（用いろよ）

*ならꜜえ + よ → ならꜜえよ（習えよ）
*てつだꜜえ + よ → てつだꜜえよ（手伝えよ）

=====Verbal dictionary form+auxiliary=====
Three groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of verbs:
*Group e: そうだ、ようだ、みたい. This group may, alternatively, interact differently with accented verbs, resulting in two accent nuclei:
**くꜜる + ようだ → くꜜるようだ or くꜜる　よꜜうだ（来るようだ）
**ならꜜう + そうだ → ならꜜうそうだ or ならꜜう　そꜜうだ（習うそうだ）
**かꜜえる + みたい → かꜜえるみたい or かꜜえる　みꜜたい（帰るみたい）
*Group f: だろう、でしょう、らしい. When interacting with accented verbs, the penultimate mora of the auxiliary may, alternatively, be accented:
**くるらしꜜい（来るらしい）
**かえるらしꜜい（帰るらしい）
*Group g: まい

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Verbal 未然形+auxiliary=====
Three groups of auxiliaries that can trail 未然形 of verbs:
*Group h: せる・させる、れる・られる
*Group i: ない
*Group j: う・よう、まい

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Verbal 連用形+auxiliary=====
Three groups of auxiliaries that can trail 連用形 of verbs:
*Group k: た・だ
*Group l: たい、そうだ
*Group m: ます

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Adjectival dictionary form+particle=====
Five groups of particles that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives:
*Group Q: と、な (exclamatory)、よ (proclamatory)、だけ、ほど、ものの
*Group R: ぜ、ぞ、ね
*Group S: ごと、さえ、とか、とて、とも、なあ、ねえ、のみ、まで、ゆえ、より、かな (exclamatory)、くらい・ぐらい、どころ、ばかり、よりか、よりも. When trailing an accented noun, くらい・ぐらい, どころ and ばかり in particular may, alternatively, make the particle&#x27;s first mora accented:
**みじかꜜい + くらい → みじかꜜいくらい or みじかいくꜜらい（短いくらい）
**うれしꜜい + どころ + の → うれしꜜいどころの or うれしいどꜜころの（嬉しいどころの）
**たかꜜい + ばかり + で → たかꜜいばかりで or たかいばꜜかりで（高いばかりで）
*Group T: か、が、さ、し、ぜ、ぞ、の、は、も、や、を、かい、かな (doubtful)、かね、から、だ、とか、とて、とも、など、なり、ので・んで、のに、やら、より、わよ、かしら、けれど、なんて、よりか、よりも、けれども
*Group U: だけ. Alternatively, behaves like Group Q.

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Adjectival 連用形+particle=====
The &quot;-ku&quot; 連用形 of accentless adjectives are also accentless:
*あつい → あつく（厚く）
*つめたい → つめたく（冷たく）
*やさしい → やさしく（優しく）

The accent nucleus of the &quot;-ku&quot; 連用形 of accented adjectives is shifted one mora backward if possible; OR, if the &quot;-ku&quot; form contains more than 3 morae, is the same as that of the dictionary form:
*なꜜい → なꜜく（無く）
*あつꜜい → あꜜつく（熱く）
*みじかꜜい → みじꜜかく or みじかꜜく（短く）
*うれしꜜい → うれꜜしく or うれしꜜく（嬉しく）

Group V consists of the following particles: て、は、も、ても. When a accentless &quot;-ku&quot; form combines with a Group-V particle, either the &quot;-ku&quot; form&#x27;s penultimate mora is accented; OR, the &quot;-shiku&quot; form&#x27;s antepenultimate mora is accented:
*あつい → あつく + て → あつꜜくて（厚くて）
*つめたい → つめたく + て → つめたꜜくて（冷たくて）
*やさしい → やさしく + て → やさしꜜくて or やさꜜしくて（優しくて）

With は in particular, the accentless &quot;-ku&quot; form&#x27;s last mora may, alternatively, accented:
*あつい → あつく + は → あつꜜくは or あつくꜜは（厚くは）
*あかるい → あかるく + は → あかるꜜくは or あかるくꜜは（明るくは）

Group V does not affect the accent nucleus of accented &quot;-ku&quot; forms:
*なꜜい → なꜜく + て → なꜜくて（無くて）
*あつꜜい → あꜜつく + て → あꜜつくて（熱くて）
*みじかꜜい → みじꜜかく + て → みじꜜかくて（短くて）
*みじかꜜい → みじかꜜく + て → みじかꜜくて（短くて）
*うれしꜜい → うれꜜしく + て → うれꜜしくて（嬉しくて）
*うれしꜜい → うれしꜜく + て → うれしꜜくて（嬉しくて）

=====Adjectival 仮定形+particle=====
Group W consists of the following particles: ば、ど、ども.

For accentless dictionary forms, the root&#x27;s last mora is accented:
*あつい → あつꜜければ（厚ければ）
*つめたい → つめたꜜければ（冷たければ）
*やさしい → やさꜜしければ（優しければ）

For accented dictionary forms, the accent nucleus shifts 1 mora backward if possible; OR if the &quot;-i&quot;, not &quot;-shii&quot;, forms contain more than 4 morae, the accent nucleus is the same as that of the dictionary form:
*なꜜい → なꜜければ（無ければ）
*あつꜜい → あꜜつければ（熱ければ）
*うれしꜜい → うれꜜしければ（嬉しければ）
*みじかꜜい → みじꜜかければ or みじかꜜければ（短ければ）

=====Adjectival dictionary form+auxiliary=====
Four groups of auxiliaries that can trail dictionary forms of adjectives:
*Group n: そうだ、ようだ、みたい. These can alternatively result in two accent nuclei when combining with accented adjectives:
**たかꜜい + そうだ → たかꜜいそうだ or たかꜜい　そꜜうだ（高いそうだ）
**たかꜜい + ようだ → たかꜜいようだ or たかꜜい　よꜜうだ（高いようだ）
**みじかꜜい + みたい → みじかꜜいみたい or みじかꜜい　みꜜたい（短いみたい）
*Group o: だろう、でしょう、らしい
*Group p: です
*Group q: らしい. Alternatively, behaves like Group o.

Notes are given where there&#x27;s a change in accent.

=====Adjectival 未然形+auxiliary=====
The only member of Group r is う, and it uniquely combines with the &quot;-karo&quot; forms of adjectives. The mora &quot;ro&quot; in &quot;-karo&quot; is accented:
*なかろꜜう（無かろう）
*あつかろꜜう（厚かろう、熱かろう）
*つめたろꜜう（冷たかろう）
*みじかかろꜜう（短かろう）
*やさしかろꜜう（優しかろう）
*うれしかろꜜう（嬉しかろう）

=====Particle/auxiliary+particle=====
When a particle or auxiliary follows a phrase that ends in another particle, if that phrase has accentless accent, its last mora is accented:
*みず + で → みずで + は → みずでꜜは（水では）
*やって + さえ → やってꜜさえ（遣ってさえ）
*みず + で → みずで + です → みずでꜜです（水でです）
*なく + と → なくと + だ → なくとꜜだ（泣くとだ）

Certain particles such as と、きり、しか、だけ may, alternatively, not alter the accentless phrase:
*みず + で → みずで + だけ → みずでꜜだけ or みずでだけ（水でだけ）
*やって + だけ → やってꜜだけ or やってだけ（遣ってだけ）

Otherwise, if that phrase has &quot;atamadaka&quot; or &quot;nakadaka&quot; accent, its accent is not altered:
*やまꜜ + に → やまꜜに + は → やまꜜには（山には）
*ならꜜって + さえ → ならꜜってさえ（習ってさえ）
*はꜜる + で → はꜜるで + は → はꜜるでは（春では）
*たꜜべて + さえ → たꜜべてさえ（食べてさえ）
*おとこꜜ + に → おとこꜜに + です → おとこꜜにです（男にです）
*たべꜜる + と → たべꜜると + です → たべꜜるとです（食べるとです）
*はꜜる + に → はꜜるに + です → はꜜるにです（春にです）
*よꜜむ + と → よꜜむと + です → よꜜむとです（読むとです）

=====Accented voiceless morae=====
Pitch accent involves a steep drop from a high pitch and a low pitch, which are facilitated by a fundamental frequency, in other words, voicing. However, the high vowels and are susceptible to devoicing, mostly between two voiceless consonants, which may interfere with accenting. In such cases where a devoiced vowel is accented, alternative pronunciations with accent shifts are possible. In following examples, devoiced morae are in bold. The suffix 県（けん） starts with a voiceless vowel and can create an environment for devoicing. As mentioned above, 県 is also a short suffix that puts the accent on the last 自立拍 before it.
*ながさきꜜけん → ながさꜜきけん（長崎県）
*やまなしꜜけん → やまなꜜしけん（山梨県）

=====List of particles and auxiliaries=====
The following list for Tokyo accent is not shown in the NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典, but slightly reworked from papers by Shiro Kori. A few patterns for missing particles and auxiliaries are inferred from the appendix アクセント to the &quot;Daijirin&quot;.

=====Trailing 補助動詞=====
Like 助動詞 (&quot;auxiliaries&quot;), 補助動詞 also modify the accent of the verbs they trail. According to the &quot;Daijirin&quot; and Kori (2020):
*のる + たꜜて → のりたて（乗り立て）
*のꜜむ + たꜜて → のみたて（飲み立て）
*くらべる + つらい → くらべづらꜜい（比べ辛い）
*のる + つらい → のりづらꜜい or のりづらい（乗り辛い）
*しらべꜜる + つらい → しらべづらꜜい（調べ辛い）
*のꜜむ + つらい → のみづらꜜい or のみづらい（飲み辛い）
*くらべる + にくꜜい → くらべにくꜜい（比べ憎い）
*のる + にくꜜい → のりにくꜜい（乗り憎い）
*しらべꜜる + にくꜜい → しらべにくꜜい（調べ憎い）
*のꜜむ + にくꜜい → のみにくꜜい（飲み憎い）

=====Compound &quot;-suru&quot; verbs=====
In two-or-more-kanji Sino-Japanese compounds, or native or foreign compounds, the accent of the word before &quot;-suru&quot; takes precedence:
*じゃま + する → じゃまする（邪魔する）
*せわꜜ + する → せわꜜする（世話する）
*あんなꜜい + する → あんなꜜいする（案内する）
*きょꜜか + する → きょꜜかする（許可する）
* つぎ + する → つぎする（継ぎする）
* たびꜜ + する → たびꜜする（旅する）
* あꜜせ + する → あꜜせする（汗する）
* ここꜜろ + する → ここꜜろする（心する）
* なꜜみだ + する → なꜜみだする（涙する）
* だꜜっこ + する → だꜜっこする（抱っこする）
* マꜜーク + する → マꜜークする
* オミꜜット + する → オミꜜットする
* ハꜜッスル + する → ハꜜッスルする

This is also the case for some single-kanji compounds where the kanji is generally capable of representing a free word with its own accent:
*とく + する → とくする（得する）
*らくꜜ + する → らくꜜする（楽する）
*そꜜん + する → そꜜんする（損する）

====Numerals====
The following table lists some compounds of numerals and their accent.

A few patterns can be spotted:
*For numerals from 1-9 (いち～きゅう・く), the accent is tentatively placed on the last mora, and if that mora is a 特殊拍, the accent is shifted backward. Exceptions include さん and なꜜな.
*For compounds from 10-90 (じゅう～きゅうじゅう・くじゅう), じゅ is accented, except in にꜜじゅう、さꜜんじゅう、よꜜんじゅう、ななꜜじゅう、きゅꜜうじゅう.
*For compounds from 100-900 (ひゃく～きゅうひゃく), the accent is &quot;odaka&quot;, except in さꜜんびゃく、よꜜんひゃく、ななꜜひゃく、きゅꜜうひゃく.
*For compounds from 1,000-100,000 (せん～じゅうまん), the accented morae are せ・ぜ and ま.
*For compounds from 200,000-900,000 (にじゅうまん～きゅうじゅうまん), either じゅ or ま can be accented. Alternative exceptions include にꜜじゅうまん、さꜜんじゅうまん、よꜜんじゅうまん、きゅꜜうじゅうまん.
*For compounds from 1,000,000-90,000,000 (ひゃくまん～きゅうせんまん), the accented mora is ま. Alternative exceptions include さꜜんびゃくまん、よꜜんひゃくまん、きゅꜜうひゃくまん.
*For compounds from 100,000,000-1,000,000,000 (いちおく～じゅうおく), the accent is tentatively placed on the last mora of the first numeral, and if that mora is a 特殊拍, the accent is shifted backward.
Compounds from 11-19:
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
*じゅꜜう + → じゅう
* + さん → さん
* + ごꜜ → ご
* + くꜜ → く

Additional rules for compounding:
#For regular compounds from 20-90 whose accented mora is じゅ, and from 100-900 with &quot;odaka&quot; accent, if they additionally compound with a numeral or another compound, the 2nd component&#x27;s accent takes precedence:
#*ごじゅꜜう + → ごじゅう
#*ごじゅꜜう + → ごじゅう
#*ごじゅꜜう + → ごじゅう
#*ごじゅꜜう + → ごじゅう
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#*ごひゃくꜜ + → ごひゃく
#For irregular compounds from 20-900 (in yellow cells in the table), the 1st component&#x27;s accent takes precedence; if the 2nd component is accented, its accent is, alternatively, kept:
#* + さん → さん
#* + さん → さん
#* + ろくꜜ → ろく or 　ろくꜜ
#* + なꜜな → なな or 　なꜜな
#* + ろくꜜ → ろく or 　ろくꜜ
#* + なꜜな → なな or 　なꜜな
#* + にꜜじゅう → にじゅう or 　にꜜじゅう
#* + ごじゅꜜう → ごじゅう or 　ごじゅꜜう
#* + ごじゅういちꜜ → ごじゅういち or 　ごじゅういちꜜ
#Compounds resulting from rule 1 follow rule 2:
#* + さん → さん
#* + ろくꜜ → ろく or 　ろくꜜ
#* + なꜜな → なな or 　なꜜな

====Numeral+counter====
Compounds formed from one or more numerals and a counter often obey certain rules. Counters can be categorized into five groups, and multiple subgroups, depending on the resulting accent:
*Group D: The resulting accent is mostly accentless:
**Group D1: Always:

===Examples of words that differ only in pitch===

In standard Japanese, about 47% of words are unaccented and around 26% are accented on the mora. However, this distribution is highly variable between word categories. For example, 70% of native nouns are unaccented, while only 50% of kango and only 7% of loanwords are unaccented. In general, most 1–2 mora words are accented on the first mora, 3–4 mora words are unaccented, and words of greater length are almost always accented on one of the last five morae.

The following chart gives some examples of minimal pairs of Japanese words whose only differentiating feature is pitch accent. Phonemic pitch accent is indicated with the phonetic symbol for downstep, .


In isolation, the words &quot;hashi&quot; はし hàshí &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;hashi&quot; hàshí &quot;edge&quot; are pronounced identically, starting low and rising to a high pitch. However, the difference becomes clear in context. With the simple addition of the particle &quot;ni&quot; &quot;at&quot;, for example, hàshí-nì &quot;at the bridge&quot; acquires a marked drop in pitch, while hàshi-ni &quot;at the edge&quot; does not. However, because the downstep occurs after the first mora of the accented syllable, a word with a final long accented syllable would contrast all three patterns even in isolation: an accentless word &quot;nihon&quot;, for example, would be pronounced , differently from either of the words above. In 2014, a study recording the electrical activity of the brain showed that native Japanese speakers mainly use context, rather than pitch accent information, to contrast between words that differ only in pitch.

This property of the Japanese language allows for a certain type of pun, called , combining two words with the same or very similar sounds but different pitch accents and thus meanings. For example, &quot;kaeru-ga kaeru&quot; . These are considered quite corny, and are associated with .

Since any syllable, or none, may be accented, Tokyo-type dialects have &quot;N&quot;+1 possibilities, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of syllables (not morae) in a word, though this pattern only holds for a relatively small &quot;N&quot;.

== Other dialects ==

Accent and tone are the most variable aspect of Japanese dialects. Some have no accent at all; of those that do, it may occur in addition to a high or low word tone.

The dialects that have a Tokyo-type accent, like the standard Tokyo dialect described above, are distributed over Hokkaido, northern Tohoku, most of Kanto, most of Chūbu, Chūgoku and northeastern Kyushu. Most of these dialects have a more-or-less high tone in unaccented words (though first mora has low tone, and following morae have high tone); an accent takes the form of a downstep, after which the tone stays low. But some dialects, for example, dialects of northern Tohoku and eastern Tottori, typically have a more-or-less low tone in unaccented words; accented syllables have a high tone, with low tone on either side, rather like English stress accent. In any case, the downstep has phonological meaning and the syllable followed by downstep is said to be &quot;accented&quot;.

Keihan (Kyoto–Osaka)-type dialects of Kansai and Shikoku have nouns with both patterns: That is, they have tone differences in unaccented as well as accented words, and both downstep in some high-tone words and a high-tone accent in some low-tone words. In the neighboring areas of Tokyo-type and Keihan-type such as parts of Kyushu, northeastern Kanto, southern Tohoku, around Fukui, around Ōzu in Ehime and elsewhere, nouns are not accented at all.

===Kyushu (two-pattern type)===

In western and southern Kyushu dialects (pink area on the map on the right), a high tone falls on a predictable syllable, depending only on whether the noun has an accent. This is termed a two-pattern (&quot;nikei&quot;) system, as there are two possibilities, accented and not accented. For instance, in the Kagoshima dialect unaccented nouns have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. In accented nouns, however, the penultimate syllable of a phonological word has a high tone, which drops on the final syllable. (Kagoshima phonology is based on syllables, not on morae.) For example, &quot;irogami&quot; &#x27;colored paper&#x27; is unaccented in Kagoshima, while &quot;kagaribi&quot; &#x27;bonfire&#x27; is accented. The ultimate or penultimate high tone will shift when any unaccented grammatical particle is added, such as nominative &quot;-ga&quot; or ablative &quot;-kara&quot;: 
:

In the Shuri dialect of the Okinawan language, unaccented words are high tone; accent takes the form of a downstep after the second syllable, or after the first syllable of a disyllabic noun. However, the accents patterns of the Ryukyuan languages are varied, and do not all fit the Japanese patterns.

&quot;Nikei&quot; accents are also found in parts of Fukui and Kaga in Hokuriku region (green area on map).

===No accent versus one-pattern type===
In Miyakonojō, Miyazaki (small black area on map), there is a single accent: all phonological words have a low tone until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. That is, every word has the pitch pattern of Kagoshima . This is called an (one-pattern) accent. Phonologically, it is the same as the absence of an accent (white areas on map), and is sometimes counted as such, as there can be no contrast between words based on accent. However, speakers of -type dialects feel that they are accenting a particular syllable, whereas speakers of unaccented dialects have no such intuition.

===Keihan (Kyoto–Osaka type)===

Near the old capital of Kyoto, in Kansai, Shikoku, and parts of Hokuriku (the easternmost Western Japanese dialects), there is a more innovative system, structurally similar to a combination of these patterns. There are both high and low initial tone as well as the possibility of an accented mora. That is, unaccented nouns may have either a high or a low tone, and accented words have pitch accent in addition to this word tone. This system will be illustrated with the Kansai dialect of Osaka.

Accented high-tone words in Osaka, like &quot;atama&quot; &#x27;head&#x27;, are structurally similar to accented words in Tokyo, except that the pitch is uniformly high prior to the downstep, rather than rising as in Tokyo. As in Tokyo, the subsequent morae have low pitch. Unaccented high-tone words, such as &quot;sakura&quot; &#x27;cherry tree&#x27;, are pronounced with a high tone on every syllable, and in following unaccented particles:

:High tone , accent on &quot;ta&quot;: 
:High tone , no accent: 

Low-tone accented words are pronounced with a low pitch on every mora but the accented one. They are like accented words in Kagoshima, except that again there are many exceptions to the default placement of the accent. For example, &quot;tokage&quot; is accented on the &quot;ka&quot; in both Osaka and Kagoshima, but &quot;omonaga&quot; &#x27;oval face&#x27; is accented on &quot;mo&quot; in Osaka and &quot;na&quot; in Kagoshima (the default position for both dialects); also, in Osaka the accented is fixed on the &quot;mo,&quot; whereas in Kagoshima it shifts when particles are added. Unaccented low-tone words such as &quot;usagi&quot; &#x27;rabbit&#x27; have high pitch only in the final mora, just as in Kagoshima:

:Low tone , accent on &quot;mo&quot;: 
:Low tone , no accent: 

Hokuriku dialect in Suzu is similar, but unaccented low-tone words are purely low, without the rise at the end: 
&quot;sakura&quot; has the same pattern as in Osaka.

In Kōchi, low-tone words have low pitch only on the first mora, and subsequent morae are high: 

The Keihan system is sometimes described as having 2&quot;n&quot;+1 possibilities, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of morae (up to a relatively small number), though not all of these actually occur. From the above table, there are three accent patterns for one-mora words, four (out of a theoretical 2&quot;n&quot;+1 = 5) for two-mora words, and six (out of a theoretical 2&quot;n&quot;+1 = 7) for three-mora words.

==Correspondences between dialects==
There are regular correspondences between Tokyo-type and Keihan-type accents. The downstep on high-tone words in conservative Keihan accents generally occurs one syllable earlier than in the older Tokyo-type accent. For example, &quot;kokoro&quot; &#x27;heart&#x27; is in Tokyo but in Osaka; &quot;kotoba&quot; &#x27;word&#x27; is in Tokyo but in Osaka; &quot;kawa&quot; &#x27;river&#x27; is in Tokyo but in Osaka. If a word is unaccented and high-tone in Keihan dialects, it is also unaccented in Tokyo-type dialects. If a two-mora word has a low tone in Keihan dialects, it has a downstep on the first mora in Tokyo-type dialects.

In Tokyo, all nakadaka verbs have the downstep on the second to last mora, except in cases of defective mora. This is the last mora of the verb stem, as in &#x27;be white&#x27; and &#x27;get up&#x27;. In Kansai, verbs have high- and low-tone paradigms as nouns do. High-tone verbs are either unaccented or are accented on the penultimate mora. Low-tone verbs are either unaccented or accented on the final syllable, triggering a low tone on unaccented suffixes. In Kyoto, verbal tone varies irregularly with inflection, a situation not found in more conservative dialects, even more conservative Kansai-type dialects such as that of Kōchi in Shikoku.

===Syllabic and moraic===

Japanese pitch accent also varies in how it interacts with syllables and morae. Kagoshima is a purely syllabic dialect, while Osaka is moraic. For example, the low-tone unaccented noun &quot;shinbun&quot; &#x27;newspaper&#x27; is in Kagoshima, with the high tone spread across the entire final syllable &quot;bun,&quot; but in Osaka it is , with the high tone restricted to the final mora &quot;n&quot;. In Tokyo, accent placement is constrained by the syllable, though the downstep occurs between the morae of that syllable. That is, a stressed syllable in Tokyo dialect, as in &quot;kai&quot; &#x27;shell&#x27; or &quot;san&quot; &#x27;divining rod&#x27;, will always have the pattern , never . In Osaka, however, either pattern may occur: &quot;tonbi&quot; &#x27;black kite&#x27; is in Tokyo but in Osaka.

<text>Peirce is a small lunar impact crater in the western part of Mare Crisium. That dark, circular lunar mare is located in the east-northeasterly part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after the American mathematician Benjamin Peirce. Peirce lies to the north of the craters Yerkes and Picard, and southeast of Macrobius located outside the mare. Just over a crater diameter to the north of Peirce is the smaller Swift. To the northwest is the wrinkle ridge Dorsum Oppel.

The rim of Peirce is roughly circular, with a slight outward bulge along the northwestern rim. There are indications of slumping along the sides of this section, producing a wider inner wall. It is generally bowl-shaped, and is marked only by a tiny craterlet along the inner southeast rim. The interior is marked by several furrows, ridges, as well as a low, conical hill near the midpoint.

Peirce is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Peirce.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Peirce B — &quot;See&quot; Swift (lunar crater).

<doc id="1213864" wikidata="Q2536351" url="?curid=1213864" title="Michael Jackson's Moonwalker">
<text>Michael Jackson&#x27;s Moonwalker is the name of several video games based on the 1988 Michael Jackson film &quot;Moonwalker&quot;. Sega developed two beat &#x27;em ups, released in 1990; one released in arcades and another released for the Sega Genesis and Master System consoles. U.S. Gold also published various games for home computers the same year. Each of the games&#x27; plots loosely follows the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; segment of the film, in which Jackson rescues kidnapped children from the evil Mr. Big, and incorporates synthesized versions of some of the musician&#x27;s songs. Following &quot;Moonwalker&quot;, Jackson collaborated with Sega on several other video games.

== Sega arcade version ==
 is an arcade video game by Sega (programming) and Triumph International (audiovisuals), with the help of Jackson which was released on the Sega System 18 hardware. The arcade has distinctively different gameplay from its computer and console counterparts, focusing more on beat &#x27;em up gameplay elements rather than platform gameplay.

=== Gameplay ===
The game is essentially a beat-em-up that is drawn using isometric video game graphics, although Jackson attacks with magic powers instead of physical contact, and has the ability to shoot short-ranged magic power at enemies. The magic power can be charged by holding the attack button to increase the range and damage of the magic power while moonwalking. If up close to enemies, Jackson executes a spinning melee attack using magic power.

If the cabinet supports it, up to three people can play simultaneously. All three players play as Jackson, dressed in his suit (white for player 1, red for player 2, black for player 3).

Jackson&#x27;s special attack is termed &quot;Dance Magic&quot;. There are three different dance routines that may be performed, namely the dance routines from Smooth Criminal, Beat It and Billie Jean. The player starts with one to three of these attacks per credit (depending on how the machine is set up).

Bubbles, Michael&#x27;s real-life pet chimpanzee, appears in each level. Once collected or rescued, Bubbles transforms Michael into a robotic version, with the ability to shoot laser bursts and missiles and absorb significantly more damage.

=== Development ===
In 1988, Michael Jackson contacted Sega about developing a video game that would capture his persona. Sega and Jackson then began working on an arcade video game based on his &quot;Moonwalker&quot; film and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; music video released that year. A prototype unit was demonstrated at Mexico&#x27;s American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) exhibition in early July 1990. Jackson assisted Sega&#x27;s game designers on the development of the game.

=== Reception ===
In North America, the game had a successful launch. It was the top-grossing new video game on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in September 1990.

The game received a positive review from &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine.

== Sega console versions ==
Home versions of the game were released for Sega&#x27;s Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System home video game systems though the gameplay was completely different from the arcade version. A version was also rated by PEGI for release on Virtual Console, but it never materialized, and it was never specified which version was considered for rerelease. The home console versions were actually based on an evolved version of the home computer version of the game (with gameplay somewhat similar to the &quot;Shinobi&quot; series), in contrast to the arcade version which was a three-quarters view shooter/fighter type game. The game involves the player controlling the pop star in a quest to save all the kids that have been kidnapped by Mr. Big.

The game&#x27;s levels and music were borrowed from the film (though many of the music tracks were taken from Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album as well) and the player has the ability to destroy enemies by making them dance. Jackson can become a robot by rescuing a certain child and then grabbing a comet that falls from the sky.

=== Gameplay ===
The gameplay is focused on finding children, all of whom resemble Katie from the movie, who are scattered throughout the levels, some behind objects such as doors. Most of the objects are empty or contain enemies. Jackson&#x27;s standard attack is a stylized high kick that is commonly incorporated into his dance routines; in the Sega Genesis version, Jackson&#x27;s attacks fire off blue sparks, giving him greater offensive range. If the player continues to hold the attack button, and moves Jackson backwards, he performs his Moonwalk dance move. Jackson also has a special attack button which, when held, will cause him to start spinning; releasing it will cause him to throw his hat at enemies, destroying them instantly, but if the button is held for longer, Jackson will bring all on-screen enemies together to start dancing to his music. Once the choreography is finished, all enemies are damaged or defeated. These special attacks cost Jackson some health, sapping up to half his full life bar at full charge. Rescuing children restores some of Jackson&#x27;s health. Once all children are rescued, Bubbles will mount on Michael&#x27;s shoulders and point him in the direction of the level&#x27;s final confrontation, where Mr. Big taunts him before sending waves of enemies for Jackson to defeat (on the Master System version, Bubbles is absent, and the levels cut straight from the final child to the enemy rush).

=== Prototype ===

A prototype of the Sega Genesis version dated April 24, 1990 surfaced that contains various differences from the final version. Most notably a full Thriller music track is present in the graveyard stage as well as a different final boss battle which is incomplete. Other differences include but are not limited to: changes in level layouts, different cutscenes, as well as minor differences in sound samples and other musical tracks. The prototype was acquired by Landon White who dumped and preserved the ROM file online on August 6, 2018.

== Home computer versions ==
Versions of the game were released for the popular 8-bit and 16-bit home computers of the time. They were developed by two small software houses, Irish Emerald Software Ltd and American Keypunch Software, and published by U.K. company U.S. Gold.

=== Gameplay ===

The game features four different levels. The first level is a top-down maze-style level. The next level has similar gameplay, riding the motorcycle collecting tokens.

The third level is a side-scrolling level based on the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; clip. The player collects ammunition and shoots at gangsters in openings above the player character.

The last level involves morphing into a robot and shooting at soldiers in openings, with the player controlling a crosshair.

== Reception ==

&quot;MegaTech&quot; said that the Mega Drive version was an addictive platform game that had &quot;excellent graphics&quot;. &quot;Mega&quot; magazine placed the game at number 91 in their list of the best Mega Drive games of all time, saying it was average. In 2004, the Genesis version of &quot;Moonwalker&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time.

&quot;Your Sinclair&quot; compared the ZX Spectrum version of the game to &quot;Gauntlet&quot; and &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;, saying it was well animated and &quot;a surprising amount of fun&quot;.

==Legacy==
Jackson later would go on to have a cameo role in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; and &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot; music/rhythm games for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. Jackson&#x27;s cameo did not return in the VR version of the first game. Jackson also appeared as a secret character in &quot;Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
All three games included a different selection of songs.

<text>Swift is a small lunar impact crater located in the northwestern part of the Mare Crisium, in the northeast part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Within two crater diameters to the south is the larger crater Peirce. It was named after American astronomer Lewis A. Swift. Swift was previously designated Peirce B.

This circular and bowl-shaped formation has a small floor at the midpoint of the sloping interior walls. It is a symmetrical crater with little evidence of wear from minor impacts.

This crater has been incorrectly named &#x27;Graham&#x27; on some maps.

<doc id="1213871" wikidata="Q14225985" url="?curid=1213871" title="For Your Love (album)">
<text>For Your Love is the first American album by the English rock band the Yardbirds. Released in June1965, it contains new studio recordings along with previously released singles. The album features some of the earliest recordings by guitarists Eric Clapton and his replacement Jeff Beck.

The Yardbirds&#x27; manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, who selected the songs, planned to capitalise on the group&#x27;s hit &quot;For Your Love&quot;. The album, released as the Yardbirds were preparing for their first American tour, reached number 96 in &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. It was unissued in the UK, although the songs with Beck were released in August 1965 on the &quot;Five Yardbirds&quot; EP.

==Recording and composition==
&quot;For Your Love&quot; features three songs from Jeff Beck&#x27;s first recording sessions with the Yardbirds: &quot;I&#x27;m Not Talking&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Done Wrong&quot;, and &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot;. Eric Clapton provided the guitar for the remainder of the tracks, that include the three Yardbirds singles (with B-sides) released up to that time and two demos which were not released in the UK until the 1980s (see discography for singles information). 

&quot;I Ain&#x27;t Done Wrong&quot; was solely credited as a Keith Relf composition, as part of the group&#x27;s desire to emulate the Beatles and some other British groups that were doing their own songwriting. In reality, though, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Done Wrong&quot; was largely a rewrite of Eddie Kirkland&#x27;s &quot;I Must Have Done Somebody Wrong&quot;, by way of Elmore James&#x27; own rewrite, &quot;Done Somebody Wrong&quot;.

Clapton, who had left the band four months earlier, is not pictured on the album cover nor mentioned in the liner notes. Group chronicler Gregg Russo notes, &quot;The cover was somewhat of a joke, as Jeff Beck was humorously seated in front of a keyboard that he did not play on the album.&quot;

==Charts and reception==
&lt;/ref&gt;
The album reached number 96 in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs chart. It was the Yardbirds&#x27; first charting album; their British debut, &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot;, did not reach the UK Albums Chart and was not issued in the US.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic writer Bruce Eder gave the album three out of five stars, who notes the inconsistency of the Gomelsky-selected material. He describes the songs with Beck as &quot;hard, loud, blazing showcases... show[ing] where the band was really heading&quot; and although the material with Clapton is &quot;primitive&quot; compared to his later efforts, it &quot;was some of the best blues-based rock &amp; roll of its era [1964].&quot;

==Track listing==
===Original album===
Songwriter credits are taken from the original Epic LP. However, since the running times are not given, those from &quot;The Yardbirds Story&quot; (2002), produced by Gomelsky, are used instead.


===Album reissues===
The Yardbirds&#x27; 2001 compilation album &quot;Ultimate!&quot; contains eight of the eleven tracks from the original album. &quot;For Your Love&quot; has been reissued by several record labels, including JVC, Castle, and Repertoire. In addition to the eleven tracks from the original album, the Repertoire reissue includes 13 non-album single and demo tracks.

<text>Wrottesley is a lunar impact crater that is attached to the west-northwestern rim of the larger crater Petavius, and lies along the southeast edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It lies in the southeast part of the moon and appears somewhat foreshortened when viewed from the earth.

This crater is generally circular in shape, with a slight outward bulge to the south and a system of s lining the inner walls. The outer wall has a moderate which merges with that of the neighboring Petavius along the southeastern half. The interior floor is nearly level, except for a central peak formation that rises at the midpoint of the interior.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Wrottesley.

<text>Richard Evan Schwartz (born August 11, 1966) is an American mathematician notable for his contributions to geometric group theory and to an area of mathematics known as billiards. Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics beginning around the late 1980s which explores finitely generated groups, and seeks connections between their algebraic properties and the geometric spaces on which these groups act. He has worked on what mathematicians refer to as &quot;billiards&quot;, which are dynamical systems based on a convex shape in a plane. He has explored geometric iterations involving polygons, and he has been credited for developing the mathematical concept known as the pentagram map. In addition, he is author of a mathematics picture book for young children. In 2018 he is a professor of mathematics at Brown University.

==Career==
Schwartz was born in Los Angeles on August 11, 1966. He attended John F. Kennedy High School in Los Angeles from 1981 to 1984, then earned a B. S. in mathematics from U.C.L.A. in 1987, and then a Ph. D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1991 under the supervision of William Thurston. He taught at the University of Maryland. He is currently the Chancellor&#x27;s Professor of Mathematics at Brown University. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Barrington, Rhode Island.

Schwartz is credited by other mathematicians for introducing the concept of the pentagram map.
According to Schwartz&#x27;s conception, a convex polygon would be inscribed with diagonal lines inside it, by drawing a line from one point to the next point—that is, by skipping over the immediate point on the polygon. The intersection points of the diagonals would form an inner polygon, and the process could be repeated. Schwartz observed these geometric patterns, partly by experimenting with computers. 
He has collaborated with mathematicians Valentin Ovsienko 
and Sergei Tabachnikov 
to show that the pentagram map is &quot;completely integrable.&quot;

In his spare time he draws comic books, writes computer programs, listens to music and exercises. He admired the late Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold and dedicated a paper to him. He played an April Fool&#x27;s joke on fellow mathematics professors at Brown University by sending an email suggesting that students could be admitted randomly, along with references to bogus studies which purportedly suggested that there were benefits to having a certain population of the student body selected at random; the story was reported in the &quot;Brown Daily Herald&quot;. Colleagues such as mathematician Jeffrey Brock describe Schwartz as having a &quot;very wry sense of humor.&quot;

In 2003, Schwartz was teaching one of his young daughters about number basics and developed a poster of the first 100 numbers using colorful monsters. This project gelled into a mathematics book for young children published in 2010, entitled &quot;You Can Count on Monsters&quot;, which became a bestseller. Each monster has a graphic which gives a mini-lesson about its properties, such as being a prime number or a lesson about factoring; for example, the graphic monster for the number five was a five-sided star or pentagram. A year after publication, it was featured prominently on &quot;National Public Radio&quot; in January 2011 and became a bestseller for a few days on the online bookstore Amazon as well as earning international acclaim. 
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; suggested that the book helped to &quot;take the scariness out of arithmetic.&quot; 
Mathematician Keith Devlin, on &quot;NPR&quot;, agreed, saying that Schwartz &quot;very skillfully and subtly embeds mathematical ideas into the drawings.&quot;

<text>The long-tailed broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae) is a species of bird that is found in the Himalayas, extending east through Northeastern India to Southeast Asia. It is the only bird in the genus Psarisomus. The long-tailed broadbill is about 25 cm (10 inches) in length and weighs between 50 and 60 grams. It can be identified by its shrill call.

The long-tailed broadbill displays a yellow plumage on the throat. Blueish-green plumage on the belly, back, and wings.
The long-tailed broadbill is a forest bird that lives on insects. It is very sociable and normally travels in large, noisy parties except during the mating season. It builds a pear-shaped nest in a tree. The female usually lays between 5 and 6 eggs that are incubated by both sexes; both sexes also help to feed the young.

== Taxonomy ==
The generic name Psarisomus comes from the name &quot;Psaris&quot;, a synonym of &quot;Tityra&quot; and the Greek word &quot;sōma&quot; &quot;body&quot;.

The long-tailed broadbill is a songbird (Passeriformes) that belongs in the family Eurylaimidae, a group of birds that have broad heads and have flat, broad beak. It is the only bird that belongs to the genus Psarisomus. The scientific name commemorates Christina Broun, Countess of Dalhousie (1786–1839), wife of George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie.

There are currently five subspecies that are recognized:

* P. d. dalhousiae  – Himalayan foothills E from N India (Uttarakhand) and Nepal, SE Bangladesh, and from N Myanmar and S China (W &amp; S Yunnan, SW Guizhou, SW Guangxi) S to N Thailand, Laos and C Vietnam (C Annam); reported also from SE Tibet.
* P. d. cyanicauda – SE Thailand and Cambodia.
* P. d. divinus – S Vietnam (S Annam).
* P. d. psittacinus – Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra.
* P. d. borneensis 1904 – N Borneo.

== Description ==
Adult long-tailed broadbills have a bright yellow throat and face, where the yellow patch ranges on each side of the occiput. The yellow feathers continue down to a form a thin band around the neck. There is a thin layer of pale-yellow/whitish feathers that envelops the yellow patch below their throat. Some even have a hint of pale yellow-green on their chin. They have a helmet-like black cap with a sleek blue patch on the crown and a smaller blue patch at the back of their neck. The feathers along the back, belly and top of the wings are bright green produced by a combination of pigmentary and structural color. The underparts of the wings are a lighter green or blueish green. The primary feathers are black, with a metallic blue margin at the base of the external web and a white spot on the base of the inner web. Long-tailed broadbill have a long blue tail, but the under-tail is black. They have strong, broad bill that is yellowish green in color with lighter edges. They have a pea-green toes and brown legs. Juvenile long-tailed broadbills have a shorter tail, green head with duller plumage. A full-grown adult stand about 10 inches in length (25 cm) and weighs anywhere between 50 and 60 grams.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The long-tailed broadbill is found in the Himalayas and Myanmar and discontinuously found through South-East Asia and the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra and Borneo. They are distributed in a variety of countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, Malaysia and Indonesia.

They are commonly found in broad-leaved evergreen forests, ranging in altitudes from 150 to 2500 meters. Their natural habitats include: forests, streams and creeks, tropical and subtropical moist lowland forests, tropical and subtropical moist mountain forests. They seem to have a habitat preference nears small bodies of water such as streams, freshwater and wetlands. They are resident, non-migratory species. The populations of long-tailed broadbills that live in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas often move down to lower altitudes during cold winter months.

== Behaviour ==
Long-tailed broadbills are social birds that are usually seen foraging about in small flocks. They have also been seen in mixed-species flocks. Despite their loud high-pitched calls, they are relatively shy birds that usually hide among the foliage of trees. They are especially noisy during breeding season.

=== Diet ===
These birds are insectivorous and are commonly found foraging forests for small insects. They can be seen foraging in small parties of up to 15 individuals during non-breeding seasons. They feed primarily on grasshoppers, crickets, locust, beetles, aphids, dipteran flies, bugs, moths and spiders. They may occasionally feed on small frogs, berries and other fruits.

=== Breeding and nesting ===
The breeding seasons of the long-tailed broadbill may vary according to location. Populations that live in the Indian Subcontinent breed from March to April, while populations residing in/near Myanmar begin breeding from April. The female will lay between 5 and 6 eggs, which are white and oval shaped. Both sexes incubate and feed the chicks. It is even suggested that Long-tailed broadbills may be cooperative breeders, since more than two individuals have been observed around the nest.

They build a large pear-shaped nest that is attached to the branch of a tall tree. The nest has a small 1-2 inch circular entrance on the side of the structure, which is usually protected by a cushion of leaves. The nest is composed of fine roots, dead leaves, creepers, mosses and other stringy vegetable matter. Once the young chicks become independent juveniles, they often disperse and settle in new locations within the habitat range.

=== Vocalization ===
The long-tailed broadbill&#x27;s call is a series of loud, sharp, downward-inflected whistles, &quot;pseeu..pseeu..pseeu&quot; and &quot;tseeay..tseeay&quot; sounds on a descending scale. They may also make a sharp rasping &quot;pseeup&quot; sound.

== Conservation ==
According to the ICUN Red list of threatened species, the long-tailed broadbill is of least concern. They are fairly common throughout their range and are found in many national parks where they are protected throughout its range.

<text>The Cameron Highlands () is a district in Pahang, Malaysia, occupying an area of . To the north, its boundary touches that of Kelantan; to the west, it shares part of its border with Perak. Situated at the northwestern tip of Pahang, Cameron Highlands is approximately east from Ipoh, roughly north from Kuala Lumpur or about from Kuantan, the capital of Pahang. It is the smallest municipality in the state.

Surveyed by the government geologist and explorer William Cameron in 1885, the outpost consists of three mukims (subdistricts), namely Ringlet, Tanah Rata and Ulu Telom. Its eight settlements are Ringlet, Tanah Rata (the administrative centre), Brinchang, the Bertam Valley, Kea Farm, Tringkap, Kampung Kuala Terla, Kampung Raja and Blue Valley. All are nestled at elevations ranging from to above sea level.

Developed in the 1930s, the tableland is one of the oldest tourist spots in Malaysia. Apart from its tea estates, the plateau is noted for its cool weather, orchards, nurseries, farmlands, waterfalls, rivers, lakes, wildlife, mossy forest, golf course, hotels, places of worship, bungalows, Land Rovers, museum and native inhabitants (Orang Asli).

==Background==
The Cameron Highlands were named after William Cameron, a Scottish explorer and geologist who was commissioned by the then colonial government to map out the Pahang-Perak border area in 1885.

In a statement concerning his mapping expedition, Cameron mentioned he saw &quot;a sort of vortex on the mountains, while for a (reasonably) wide area we have gentle slopes and plateau land.&quot; When approached, Sir Hugh Low, the Resident of Perak (1887–1889), expressed the wish of developing the region into a &quot;sanatorium, health resort and open farmland.&quot; A narrow path to Cameron Highlands was then carved through the jungle. Nothing much happened after that.

Forty years later, the tableland was given another review when Sir George Maxwell (1871–1959) visited the locale to see if it could be turned into a resort. He spent about nine days surveying the territory. Maxwell described the terrain as being &quot;somewhat oval in shape on his return from the highlands.&quot; After comparing it with Nuwara Eliya in Sri Lanka and Baguio in the Philippines, he decreed that the site should be developed into a hill station.

In mid-1925, an Agricultural Experiment Station was set up to confirm if cinchona, tea, coffee, fruits and vegetables could be grown at the district. In December 1925, a superintendent was appointed to supervise the 200-acre (81-ha) plantation on Mount Beremban. While research at the station was being carried out, the colonial office assigned Captain C.C. Best, a surveyor from the Federated Malay States to trace the Telom River (Malay: &quot;Sungei Telom&quot;). The Annual Report of the Survey Department (1925) states he explored &quot;the Ulu of the Telom which was the actual area traversed by Cameron&quot; and &quot;he went first to what is known as Cameron Highlands to obtain a basis of comparison and from there crossed over into the Telom Valley. He made a reconnaissance map of the headwaters of the Telom and his exploration has established definitely that the area at the Ulu of the Bertang (Bertam?) is incomparably the most suitable for development.&quot; This report, coupled with the confirmation that tea could also be grown, gave the British the motivation to develop the place.

In 1926, a development committee was formed to zone off the moorlands agriculture, defense, administration, housing, and recreation. Later, a three-million-dollar road was constructed from Tapah to the highlands. It started from the 19th mile Tapah-Pahang Road and ended at Ginting &quot;B&quot; (Tanah Rata). The three-year contract was awarded to Messrs. Fogden, Brisbane and Company. The first installment of $250,000 was made in 1926. The project commenced on 1 January 1928; it was completed on Friday, 14 November 1930 – 47 days ahead of schedule. The building of the road was a challenge: the crew not only had to deal with the weather; they also had to cope with the risk of being struck down with malaria. The manning level varied from 500 to 3,000 workers during the construction stage. Throughout the contract, 375 employees were hospitalized for fever. The biggest problem faced by the contractor was the haulage of heavy equipment from the lowlands to the upper reaches. This setback was overcome with the use of steam-driven locomotives which were designed for work on steep gradients.

When the road was opened in 1931, the British and the locals moved in to settle on the slopes of the mountain. They were soon followed by tea planters and vegetable growers who found the climate to be suitable for the growth of their crops. On 1 July 1931, Cameron Highlands was made an autonomous sub-district under Kuala Lipis, with its own Deputy District Officer subordinate to the Lipis District Officer. By the mid-1930s, there was a notable improvement in the constituency: it now had a six-hole golf course, several cottages, three inns, a police post, two boarding schools, a military camp, a dairy, a horse spelling ranch, nurseries, vegetable farms, tea plantations, a Government Rest House and an Agricultural Experiment Station. The domain continued to grow until the outbreak of the Second World War. During the Japanese Occupation of the Malay Peninsula (1942–1945), there was hardly any development in the area. When the Japanese withdrew in August 1945, the place transformed. This, however, came to a halt during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960). When the conflict ended, Cameron Highlands&quot; experienced a constant change in its landscape. Today, the haven is not only the biggest and best known of Malaysia&#x27;s hill stations; it is also the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia accessible by car.

==Demographics==

The district has a diverse population of 33,278 people. It comprises Chinese (13,099), Bumiputeras (12,989) — Malays (7,321); others (mainly Orang Aslis (5,688) — Indians (6,988), non-Malaysian citizens (5,193), and other nationalities (202). Most of the residents are entrepreneurs, service industry employees, farm workers, retirees or government servants.

==Politics==
Previously contested as part of Kuala Lipis, parliamentary representation for Cameron Highlands was granted in 2004. Though named as such, the Cameron Highlands also covers a few areas that are outside the ward. For instance, the FELDA settlement of Sungai Koyan, which is represented by the Cameron Highlands in the federal parliament, is located in the district of Kuala Lipis. The Cameron Highlands itself contributes two seats to the Pahang State Legislative Assembly — Tanah Rata and Jelai. The Tanah Rata constituency covers the entire district of the Cameron Highlands; the Jelai constituency covers the western part of Kuala Lipis which includes Sungai Koyan and some other FELDA settlements.

==Geography==

The Cameron Highlands is one of the 11 districts of Pahang. Occupying an area of , the district comprises three townships and five settlements. Tucked up high in the Pahangese and Perakian sections of the Titiwangsa Mountains, the mountainous spine of Peninsular Malaysia, it owes its present standing to its location at a high altitude (generally between to above sea level). There are eight mountains (&quot;gunung&quot; in Malay) at the retreat. They are Mts. Brinchang (), Berembun (), Irau (), Jasar (), Mentigi (), Perdah () and Siku (). Mount Swettenham () is located on its border with Kelantan. At the top of Mount Brinchang is a radio and television station. It was constructed by the British in the early 1950s. Close to it is the famed mossy forest. The trail to the forest starts from the BOH Sungei Palas Tea Plantation. It takes about 15 minutes to reach the cloud forest by road.

Cameron Highlands is unique compared to the other hill stations in Malaysia — three river systems drain it with numerous tributaries (totaling 123). Their high points serve as the water catchment for the Pahang and Perak rivers (Malay: &quot;Sungai Pahang&quot; and &quot;Sungai Perak&quot;).

Overall, much of the retreat is still forested (estimated at 71%). Jungle trails lead visitors to tranquil spots, waterfalls, and aboriginal villages. Most of the tracks begin at Tanah Rata. There are more than ten paths to pick and choose from. Depending on its distance, some routes can take as long as five hours to cover. Apart from its numerous walks, the sanctuary is also known for its native inhabitants, the Orang Asli, who rely on the land for subsistence farming, hunting, and fishing. Many have left to take up residence in the nearby towns. There are still some who prefer to treat the woods as their home. To date, there have been many changes at the resort. During the colonial era, the county was developed to be &quot;a healthy hill station similar to Nuwara Eliya.&quot; Today, it is different. During the Post-Independence Period (1957–1973), vast tracts of land were cleared for agriculture and infrastructure development. After 1974, more land was cleared for agriculture, housing projects, power plants, logging activities, livestock farming, hotel construction, small-scale industries, human resettlement, and road building. There is no doubt that some advances have brought economic benefits. This, however, has come with a price. Over the years, the &quot;development (in this area) has been at the expense of the weather and the environment,&quot; as well as the indigenous communities&#x27; consent.

===Biodiversity===

Cameron Highlands is one of the few places in Malaysia that serves as a habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, as well as hosting a totally different ecosystem. There are more than 700 species of plants that grow here. The vegetation changes as one ascends the mountain. The ward is known for its tea growing, vegetable farms and flower nurseries. Its woodlands form the prevailing natural ecosystem within and around the prefecture. Of the fauna, the Sumatran serow, mountain peacock-pheasant and Malayan whistling-thrush are listed in the 2004 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In 1958, the outpost was declared as deer reserve. Four years later, it became a venue affording protection to animals and birds.

===Climate===
The climate of the Cameron Highlands is on the border between a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Af&quot;) and a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). Its mean annual temperature is . During the day, the temperature seldom rises over ; at night, it can drop to as low as at the higher reaches. Its yearly precipitation is more than . The lowest temperature recorded was on Wednesday, 1 February 1978 – the temperature dropped to at an altitude of 1,471.6 metres above sea level.

==Transportation==
The Cameron Highlands can be accessed by road via Tapah, Simpang Pulai, Gua Musang or Sungai Koyan. Tapah and Simpang Pulai are the two approaches from Perak. Gua Musang and Sungai Koyan are the entryways from Kelantan and Pahang, respectively.

===Car===
Until the 1990s the only access road to the Cameron Highlands was by Federal Route 59 which begins in Tapah, Perak. In 2004, a new access road was opened — Federal Route 185 — connecting Simpang Pulai (about a kilometre south of Ipoh, Perak) through the northern part of the Highlands and Gua Musang in southern Kelantan before terminating in Kampung Kuala Jenderis in Hulu Terengganu, Terengganu.

By 2010 a third access route was opened — Federal Route 102 — connecting Ringlet to FELDA Sungai Koyan, near Kuala Lipis. With the opening of this route, motorists from the other parts of Pahang (especially Kuantan) are now able to access the district of Cameron Highlands without having to leave the state. There is another route to the hill station — the Pahang State Route (C5). It links Sungai Koyan to Raub which is the gateway to Fraser&#x27;s Hill.

===Public transportation===
As with most of western Pahang, the Cameron Highlands is not served by any KTM railway station, the closest being in Kuala Lipis and Tapah Road. Nevertheless, several bus services connect the Highlands to the cities and towns, such as Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Penang and Tapah.

<doc id="1213903" wikidata="Q2440221" url="?curid=1213903" title="Shelby Series 1">
<text>Shelby Series 1 is a high-performance roadster designed by Carroll Shelby and produced by Shelby American.
It was powered by Oldsmobile&#x27;s 4.0-litre &quot;L47 Aurora&quot; V8 engine. Unveiled at the 1997 Los Angeles Auto Show, it was intended to be a modern day reinterpretation of the original Shelby AC Cobra. Despite initial claims that the car was entirely built in-house, much of the production run was overseen by General Motors with much of the components used from their parts bin, including the powerplant.

==Development==
Prior to production of the Series 1, significant costs were incurred in testing and certification required to conform to 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In early 2000, Shelby announced a retroactive price increase but were forced to backtrack within a few weeks. Another developmental issue was the car&#x27;s soft top; these were not attaching properly and required reengineering after the first sixty-plus cars had already been built. Thirty cars had been delivered without convertible tops and technicians were sent to install them at buyers&#x27; homes. A production run of 500 cars had been announced, but in total 249 of the Series 1 were constructed by Shelby American, all as 1999 models.

During production, Venture Corporation purchased Shelby American. The purchase included the rights to the Series 1 model, but not the rights to produce the &quot;Continuation Series&quot; Shelby Cobras. In 2004, after a subsequent bankruptcy by Venture Corporation, Carroll Shelby&#x27;s new company Shelby Automobiles, Inc. purchased the Series 1 assets for pennies on the dollar. Included in the asset purchase were sufficient components to produce several more complete Series 1s.

Because the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certificate had expired, and the cost to re-certify the car was prohibitive, all Series 1&#x27;s produced after that date were completed as &quot;component cars&quot; and delivered with no engine or transmission. Those &quot;component car&quot; models built in 2005 are identified with a seven digit vehicle identification number (VIN) and were designated with a CSX5000 series serial number. The original 249 were production cars with a seventeen digit VIN.

A lot of the interior components came from General Motors, such as a Monsoon premium sound system, an A/M-F/M cassette player and CD player radio from Buick, an instrument cluster and climate controls from Pontiac, and a few other parts.

==Technical specifications==

The engine was rated at with two upgrade options available. The first option, called X50 cost US$20,150. It was supposed to add an additional to the engine&#x27;s power output. The second option included the addition of a supercharger costing US$35,100 which increased the power output up to . Shelby American Records show only 11 cars were built with both X50 and the supercharged options. Although the X50 package came up short of its advertised gains, both options worked well together pushing the power output to just over . The X50 optioned cars required a US$4,160 2 piston brake package upgrade. While factory supercharged cars were additionally required to add an US$11,050 4 piston brake package upgrade and were additionally fitted with a special dual disc clutch system. 

The Series 1 came with all creature comforts of a luxury performance car. It had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The convertible top folded away out of sight in a compartment located behind the cabin. Some cars were sold as a true open top with no convertible tops.

The Series 1 had dual wishbone suspension with coil-over remote reservoir dampers mounted inboard, and actuated by rocker arms. The engine was mounted completely behind the front axle and drove a drive shaft supported in a torque tube that spun a 6 speed ZF trans-axle specially modified for the Series 1. The chassis was made of extruded and formed 6061 aluminum. It was welded together and then post-heat-treated for maximum strength throughout. Then aluminum honeycomb panels specially designed were bonded into the floor boards and rocker panels for added structure and stiffness. The body panels were carbon fiber and fiberglass laminate. The engine, torque-tube, trans-axle, and damper mounts were all rubber-isolated from the frame. The supercharged prototypes had an engine power output of and of torque. The Goodyear Eagle F1 tires specially made for the car, were based on an IMSA racing rain tires that had been used for the show car. 

Performance figures include a 0-60 mph (0–96 km/h) acceleration time of 4.4 seconds and a quarter mile time of 12.8 seconds at . The Series 1 can attain a top speed of - the car weighed .

*Wheels rear: 18&quot;x12&quot;
*Tires front: 265/40 ZR-18
*Tires rear: 315/40 ZR-18

== Series II ==
After the bankruptcy of Venture Corporation, new investors approached Carroll Shelby with plans to build a Series II (a.k.a.: &quot;Series 2&quot;). The design was much like the Series I, but with restyled bumpers, headlamp assemblies, improved powertrain, more horsepower and other refinements. Three prototype Series II’s were built for introduction at the 2006 Concorso Italiano in Monterey, CA. They were introduced at a price of $225,000 for the production models. Orders with deposits were placed for a limited production run. All but a few production slots sold out in a relatively short time.

After the prototypes were completed and before production began, more restrictive US DOT emission and safety standards became law, pushing the cost of Series II homologation well beyond what was originally anticipated. With the significant changes and additional testing required to meet new standards, the project ran out of money and was put on hold. Over $5,000,000 US was invested into the Series 2 project, but only the three Series II prototypes were built.

The Series II project was relaunched in 2024, ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Series 1. Only 10 cars are set to be produced, with a choice of three engine options; a 7.0-litre 427 Windsor V8, a 7.3-litre ‘Godzilla’ V8 Ford Performance crate engine, or an all-electric powertrain. Unlike the previous Series II concept, this version features a hardtop roof. Prices begin at £305,000.

<text>The Extra 200 (Type EA-200) is a two-seat, tandem arrangement, low-wing aerobatic monoplane with conventional (taildragger) landing gear fully capable of Unlimited category competition, built by Extra Flugzeugbau.

Designed by Walter Extra, it was introduced to the United States market in 1996. The Extra 200 is slightly smaller than the Extra 300, and is powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) rather than the Extra 300&#x27;s 300 hp (224 kW) Lycoming engine. It offers the flying characteristics of the EA-300, is capable of all unlimited maneuvers, and makes a great all-round training/sports aerobatic aircraft.

==Design==
The Extra 200 is based on the design of the Extra 300, and the two aircraft share many similarities. The Extra 200 has a welded steel (4130) tube fuselage covered in fiberglass and fabric with a carbon/glass hybrid composite empennage (i.e., the tail assembly, including the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, elevators, and rudder), and a bubble canopy. The monocoque wings have a carbon fiber composite spar with fiberglass skins and an integral fuel tank. A symmetrical airfoil, mounted with a zero angle of incidence, provides equal performance in both upright and inverted flight. The landing gear is fixed taildragger style with composite main legs and fiberglass wheel pants. The piston-engined powerplant is a fuel-injected Lycoming AEIO-360-A1E that produces 200 horsepower (149 kW), and it is equipped with a 3-bladed constant-speed MTV-12-B-C/C 183-17e propeller made of laminated wood encased in glass-fiber reinforced plastic. The Extra 200 is stressed for ±10 G with one person on board and ±8 G with two, and has an FAA certified load factor in the US to ±10 G.

==Background==
In the late 1990s, the Extra 200 was considerably less expensive, at $170,000 (1996 new), versus the Extra 300L&#x27;s price of $235,000 (1996 new). The Extra 200 is now back in limited production (2007) after a hiatus in which Extra Aircraft focused on the development of the Extra EA-500 whose costs of development forced the company into bankruptcy. With new ownership, the company is again producing a range of aerobatic aircraft including the EA-200. The base price is $225,000 as of 2007.

<doc id="1213907" wikidata="Q2533294" url="?curid=1213907" title="Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds">
<text>Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds, or simply Having a Rave Up, is the second American album by the English rock group the Yardbirds. It was released in November 1965, eight months after Jeff Beck replaced Eric Clapton on guitar. It includes songs with both guitarists and reflects the group&#x27;s blues rock roots and their early experimentations with psychedelic and hard rock. The title refers to the driving &quot;rave up&quot; arrangement the band used in several of their songs.

The album contains some live recordings from March 1964 when Clapton was the lead guitarist, and which first appeared on the band&#x27;s British debut album, &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot;, which was not issued in the United States. The songs with Beck were recorded in the studio in the months after he joined the group in March 1965. These include several charting singles and introduced &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin&quot;, one of the Yardbirds&#x27; most copied arrangements. Although most were not written by the group, the songs became a fixture of the group&#x27;s concert repertoire and continued to be performed after Jimmy Page replaced Beck.

Next to their 1967 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection, &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; is the Yardbirds&#x27; highest-charting album in the US and has remained in print longer than others in the band&#x27;s catalogue. The album continues to be reissued, often with bonus material, such as the next single &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, demo recordings for their follow-up album, and &quot;Stroll On&quot;, featuring dual lead guitar by Beck and Page, from the &quot;Blow-Up&quot; soundtrack. Several music critics have cited the album&#x27;s influence, particularly on hard rock guitar.
==Background==
Singer and harmonica player Keith Relf, rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja, bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, drummer Jim McCarty, and lead guitarist Top Topham formed the Yardbirds near London in mid-1963. The group were a part of the early British rhythm and blues scene that produced bands such as the Rolling Stones, whom they replaced as the resident act at the Crawdaddy Club. Songs by American blues and rhythm and blues artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Bo Diddley made up the repertoire of the early British R&amp;B groups. The Yardbirds&#x27; set lists included &quot;I Wish You Would&quot;, &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Judge a Book by the Cover&quot;, and &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot;.

Eric Clapton replaced Topham in October 1963 and by early 1964, the Yardbirds had expanded their following on the home counties club circuit. The group made several attempts at recording in the studio, but were unable to reproduce their live sound to their satisfaction. Manager Giorgio Gomelsky then arranged to have a March performance at London&#x27;s Marquee Club recorded. A key element of the Yardbirds&#x27; live shows was an extended instrumental section during some songs. Clapton recalled, &quot;While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, we were taking three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy&quot;. Dubbed a &quot;rave up&quot;, this musical arrangement usually came during the middle instrumental section, in which the band shifted the beat into double-time and built the instrumental improvisation to a climax. The rave up has roots in jazz and became a signature part of the Yardbirds&#x27; sound. Musicologist Michael Hicks describes it:

Several songs recorded at the Marquee show use this arrangement and are included on the debut album, &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot;, which was released in the UK in December 1964. Although AllMusic critic Bruce Eder calls it &quot;the best such [British rock] live record of the entire middle of the decade&quot;, it did not reach the charts and was not issued in the US. Four songs from the album made their first American appearance on &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot;.

After their first two singles, &quot;I Wish You Would&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot;, had limited success, the Yardbirds were under pressure to deliver a hit record by their label, Columbia Records. Samwell-Smith interested the group in recording &quot;For Your Love&quot;, a new pop rock-oriented song written by Graham Gouldman. Clapton expressed displeasure over departing from the group&#x27;s blues roots, and he left the Yardbirds two days before the song was released on 5 March 1965. &quot;For Your Love&quot; became their first Top 10 hit in both the UK and the US. To replace Clapton, the group needed a lead guitarist who was experienced with blues and R&amp;B, but also willing to explore more progressive and experimental material. They approached Jimmy Page, but he was unwilling to give up his steady employment as one of London&#x27;s most popular studio guitarists. Page recommended Jeff Beck, who was invited to an informal audition. Drummer McCarty recalled the tryout: &quot;Not only could he play all the Eric stuff, but also a lot more ... There was the Les Paul thing, the rockabilly thing, the whole lot. His style was also kind of futuristic. We were impressed.&quot; Beck was asked to join and played his first gig with the Yardbirds the same day &quot;For Your Love&quot; was released.

Shortly thereafter, the Yardbirds began recording a successful string of forward-looking singles with Beck&#x27;s pioneering hard rock and psychedelic guitar work. Their first American album, &quot;For Your Love&quot;, which included Beck&#x27;s earliest recordings with the group and earlier singles and demos with Clapton, was rush-released in June 1965 as they were preparing for their first American tour. In November 1965, less than a month before the beginning of the Yardbirds&#x27; second tour of the US, &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; was released and also combined songs recorded with both Clapton and Beck.

==Composition and musical style==
With the exception of &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot;, the songs on &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; were not composed by the Yardbirds. Two of the album&#x27;s hits, &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; and &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot;, were written for the group by Gouldman, who had composed &quot;For Your Love&quot;. Both songs saw the group continuing to move beyond their blues-rock beginnings with Beck&#x27;s experimental guitar work. &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; is one of the earliest rock songs to incorporate Indian musical influences. Several months before the Beatles popularised the sound with &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, demos for &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; were attempted with sitar accompaniment. However, the Indian sitar player had difficulty with the 4/4 metre and the instrument lacked the power the group desired. Instead, Beck produced a sitar-like effect by bending the higher notes on his guitar in an Eastern-sounding scale and using a Tone Bender distortion device to get a more distinctive tone. The minor key, pop-oriented &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot; also incorporates exotic-sounding elements. Rock critic Richie Unterberger notes the &quot;haunting Middle Eastern-influenced melody ... typically eerie backup harmonies, [and] Keith Relf&#x27;s menacing, hurt lead vocal&quot;. Beck provides a steel guitar-like slide solo, which biographer Martin Power describes as a &quot;shimmering two-octave slide solo sounding almost ghostly&quot;. &quot;You&#x27;re a Better Man Than I&quot; was written by Mike Hugg and his brother Brian. The song reflects the folk-rock style of the time with socially conscious lyrics. Relf&#x27;s folk-ballad vocal is complemented by Beck&#x27;s vibrato- and sustain-heavy guitar solo. &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot; is the album&#x27;s sole original tune by the band, written by Samwell-Smith and McCarty. It is a slow, brooding piece with psychedelic pop elements. Built on a mock-Gregorian chant, the song has seven vocal parts with producer Gomelsky adding a droning bass vocal under Relf&#x27;s melody.
The balance of the songs are blues and R&amp;B numbers. Two versions of the Bo Diddley tune &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; are on the album – a live rendering with Clapton and a re-worked studio version with Beck. These two recordings illustrate differences between Clapton&#x27;s and Beck&#x27;s styles during their tenures with the Yardbirds. Clapton employs a more traditional sound with chording, whereas Beck takes a more novel approach, which Power describes: &quot;[T]hings changed radically at one minute, 28 seconds into the song when Beck&#x27;s foot smashed into his Tone Bender [and he] and Relf chased after each other in a manic harmonica/guitar interface, notes swooping in and out of the mix&quot;. Although just over two and a half minutes, critic Cub Koda calls the Beck version &quot;perhaps the most famous Yardbirds rave-up of all&quot; and Power asserts &quot;it was the closest the group had yet come to capturing the sound of the &#x27;rave-up&#x27; on tape&quot;.

The remaining three live songs with Clapton feature extended instrumental improvisation. Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Here &#x27;Tis&quot; and the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Respectable&quot; are fast-tempo, rhythmic-based songs that are essentially rave ups. On &quot;Here &#x27;Tis&quot;, Clapton adds an uncharacteristically energetic rhythm guitar over Samwell-Smith&#x27;s driving bass lines. In his autobiography, Clapton identifies Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; as the Yardbirds&#x27; most popular live number. They usually played it every night and performances of the song could last up to 30 minutes. On the 5:35 album version, Clapton trades guitar licks with Relf&#x27;s harmonica lines. Howlin&#x27; Wolf reportedly referred to the group&#x27;s &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; as &quot;the definitive version of his song&quot;.

The Yardbirds based their version of &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin&quot; on the 1956 rockabilly arrangement by Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio. However, their recording adds a brief rave up section, new guitar parts, and a harmonica solo. Beck biographer Annette Carson notes, &quot;the Yardbirds&#x27; recording plucked the old Rock &amp; Roll Trio number from obscurity and turned it into a classic among classics&quot;.

==Recording and production==
The recordings with Beck for &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; took place at various studios between April and September 1965. Three were recorded during the Yardbirds&#x27; first American tour – &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin and &quot;You&#x27;re a Better Man than I&quot; were recorded 12 September 1965 by Sam Phillips at his Phillips Recording studio in Memphis, Tennessee, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; (studio version) at the Chess Studios in Chicago by Ron Malo 19 September 1965. Further refinements to the three songs were recorded at the Columbia Recording Studio in New York City by Roy Halee 21 and 22 September 1965.

Another three songs with Beck were recorded by Roger Cameron at Advision Studios in London – &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot; 20 April 1965, &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot; 17 August 1965 (also at Olympic Studios by Keith Grant 27 July 1965), and &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot; 23 August 1965. The four remaining live songs with Clapton were recorded in March 1964 at the Marquee Club in London – &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;, &quot;Respectable&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, and &quot;Here &#x27;Tis&quot;. These were taken from the UK debut album &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot;.

The album was produced by the Yardbirds&#x27; manager Gomelsky with Samwell-Smith. Clapton acknowledges that Samwell-Smith was behind the group&#x27;s rave up sound and on &quot;For Your Love&quot;, Samwell-Smith assumed the role of &quot;de facto&quot; producer. He received a credit as &quot;Musical Director&quot; for their first American album as well as &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot;. By the time Samwell-Smith left the group in June 1966, Koda notes, &quot;he was shouldering most, if not all, of the production and arranging responsibilities&quot;.

==Release and charts==
&quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; was released in the US on 15 November 1965 by the Yardbirds&#x27; American label, Epic Records. The album cover photo shows the group posing in matching black suits in a mock performance; Yardbirds&#x27; biographer Adam Clayson compares it to &quot;more of a tea dance than a rave-up&quot;. Clapton, who left the band eight months earlier, is not pictured on the album cover. The liner note reads like ad copy, with no mention of the band members or recording information. The album entered &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top LPs chart in December 1965 at number 137 and reached number 53 in February 1966. In total, it spent 33 weeks in the chart. &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; remained in print until 1972, longer than any other Yardbirds album on Epic.

&quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; or an equivalent was not released in the UK, where it was the practice at the time not to include singles on albums. The live tracks with Clapton appeared on &quot;Five Live Yardbirds&quot;, which was issued on 4 December 1964. Between June and October 1965, &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot;, &quot;Evil Hearted You&quot;, and &quot;Still I&#x27;m Sad&quot; were released as singles and reached the pop chart Top 10. In February 1966, &quot;You&#x27;re a Better Man than I&quot; became the UK B-side of &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;. &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin and &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; (studio version) were not released in the UK until 1976 and 1977, well after the group had disbanded. In January 1966, the Yardbirds&#x27; UK label, Columbia, pressed &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; for export to Germany and Sweden. In Canada, the album was issued by Capitol Records in 1966.

==Live and film performances==
Five songs from &quot;Having a Rave Up&quot;, plus the following two singles, made up the core of the Yardbirds&#x27; concert repertoire: &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re a Better Man Than I&quot;, &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin, &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, and &quot;Over Under Sideways Down&quot;. Numerous live performances were recorded beginning in mid-1965 and include these songs. They were also recorded by the BBC on various dates for broadcast. In 1991, several were released on &quot;Yardbirds ...On Air&quot; (reissued in 1997 as &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;).

During one of many appearances on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, the UK pop music variety television programme, the Yardbirds performed an updated version of &quot;Here &#x27;Tis&quot; with Beck. After Page joined the group in June 1966, film director Michelangelo Antonioni wanted to add a scene of the Yardbirds performing &quot;The Train Kept A-Rollin to his 1966 film &quot;Blowup&quot;. Relf wrote new lyrics and the group worked out a new instrumental arrangement with both Beck and Page on lead guitars, retitled &quot;Stroll On&quot;. The performance is included in the film and on the &quot;Blow-Up&quot; soundtrack album.

When Beck left the group in October 1966, Page became the sole guitarist. Although several new songs were added, set lists still included their earlier material. A 1968 live performance in New York City (released in 1971 as &quot;Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page&quot;) features the core songs, plus the Page solo piece &quot;White Summer&quot; and an early version of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. Page carried over these songs to Led Zeppelin and &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; became a medley, which developed into &quot;How Many More Times&quot;. Dreja sums up the lasting appeal: &quot;We all feel, I think, that the period Jeff spent with the band was the most creative. His scope of inventiveness was probably the widest of the three guitarists we played with—and none of them were exactly slouches.&quot;

==Critical reception and influence==
&quot;Having a Rave Up&quot; was released before the advent of critical rock music journalism. A December 1965 staff review in &quot;Billboard&quot; indicated the album&#x27;s potential to enter the Top LPs chart. Several retrospective reviews have been favourable. AllMusic&#x27;s Eder gave the album four and a half out of five stars and describes it as &quot;one of the best LPs of the entire British invasion, on a par with the greatest mid-1960s work of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones&quot;. Author Denise Sullivan noted, &quot;Among British blues-rock albums, this Giorgio Gomelsky production is the pick for its wealth of hits and its influence on garage rock and hard rock lead guitar.&quot;

Clapton biographer David Bowling calls the album &quot;early and important rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll ... It remains an important step in the evolution of rock music.&quot; A review in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine included: 
 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album at number 355 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The accompanying review noted, &quot;Freed from Eric Clapton&#x27;s blues purism and spurred by Jeff Beck&#x27;s reckless exhibitionism, the Yardbirds launched a noisy rock &amp; roll avant-garde. This is the bridge between beat groups and psychedelia.&quot; &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; identified the album as one of &quot;The Top 100 &#x27;60s Rock Albums&quot; in 2015. The accompanying listing statement focuses on the guitarists: &quot;Half Eric Clapton (on the live blues part), half Jeff Beck (on the more experimental pop stuff), this is the two sides of the Yardbirds reaching for a common ground. Take your pick: The electricity surging through both guitarists powers a band that had songs and chops to spare.&quot;

<text>The Wisconsin Fellowship of Baptist Churches (WFBC) is an organization of fundamental independent Baptist churches in the U.S. state of Wisconsin.

This fellowship began in 1950 as the &quot;Conservative Baptist Association of Wisconsin&quot;. This association was sympathetic to, but not officially affiliated with, the Conservative Baptist Association of America, an association organized because of what many felt was growing liberalism in the old Northern Baptist Convention. At its annual meeting in 1969, the &quot;Conservative Baptist Association of Wisconsin&quot; changed its name to &quot;Wisconsin Fellowship of Baptist Churches&quot;. WFBC offices are located in Johnson Creek, Wisconsin.

<doc id="1213911" wikidata="Q3520556" url="?curid=1213911" title="The Deep End, Volume 2">
<text>The Deep End, Volume 2 is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Gov&#x27;t Mule. The album was released on October 8, 2002, by ATO Records.

After the death of founding member and bass guitarist Allen Woody, the band began recording tracks using bass players that Woody had admired. Originally, there was to be one disc, but so many musicians wanted to be part of the sessions that over 160 minutes of music was recorded. At this point, the remaining members Warren Haynes and Matt Abts decided to split the project into two releases.

&quot;The Deep End, Volume 1&quot; was issued in 2001, and Vol 2 was generally the harder sounding of the two releases although it also featured country and jazz tracks as well. The release also featured a bonus disc, &quot;Hidden Treasure&quot;, which contained live material, a song remix, and a new studio track recorded after the Deep End sessions had ended.

<doc id="1213916" wikidata="Q631439" url="?curid=1213916" title="Bridget St John">
<text>Bridget St John (born Bridget Anne Hobbs; 4 October 1946 in East Molesey, Surrey, England) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for the three albums she recorded between 1969 and 1972 for John Peel&#x27;s Dandelion record label. Peel produced her debut album, &quot;Ask Me No Questions&quot;. She also recorded a large number of BBC Radio and Peel sessions and toured regularly on the British college and festival circuit. 

St John appeared at leading folk venues in the UK, along with other folk and pop luminaries of the time such as Nick Drake, Paul Simon, and David Bowie, among others. In 1974 she was voted fifth most popular female singer in that year&#x27;s &quot;Melody Maker&quot; readers poll. Blessed with a &quot;rich cello-like&quot; vocal style, she is also an accomplished guitar player who credits John Martyn and Michael Chapman as her &quot;musical brothers&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
St John grew up in a musical household where her mother and sisters were all accomplished pianists. She took piano lessons at her mother&#x27;s behest, but she did not get along with her teacher and quit when she was 11. After studying the viola for two years and then the trumpet for two years, St John bought a guitar with £20 her grandmother gave her shortly before she finished high school. Her first performances were at Sheffield University in 1964–5, and her very first &quot;proper gig&quot; was at a pub in Rotherham. In 1967, St John spent three months in Aix-en-Provence as part of her French studies. During this period she met American singer-songwriter Robin Frederick.

===Solo career, 1968–1974===
When it was time to return to England, St John travelled back to London with Robin Frederick. It was through Frederick that St John met John Martyn when he was living in Richmond. He was instrumental in getting St John&#x27;s music out to a larger audience. In 1968, a poet friend of theirs, Pete Roche, put St John in touch with John Peel for his &quot;Nightride&quot; radio show. St John&#x27;s first recording sessions for Peel were recorded by Al Stewart in 1968 on Stewart&#x27;s ReVox. The four songs she recorded were released on &quot;John Peel Presents Top Gear&quot;, Peel&#x27;s 1969 compilation of BBC demos. The four songs were: &quot;The River&quot; (written by Martyn), &quot;Song To Keep You Company&quot; (written by St John), &quot;Night In The City&quot; (written by Joni Mitchell), and &quot;Lazarus&quot; (traditional).

Peel and Clive Selwood formed Dandelion initially to release St John&#x27;s music. St John&#x27;s 1969 debut album for Dandelion, &quot;Ask Me No Questions&quot;, was produced by Peel and recorded in nine to ten hours. &quot;Curl Your Toes&quot; and &quot;Ask Me No Questions&quot; featured Martyn on second guitar. Richie Unterberger reviewing for AllMusic called the album &quot;music for wandering through meadows on overcast days&quot;.

In 1970, St John recorded a vocal duet with Kevin Ayers on &quot;The Oyster and the Flying Fish&quot; for his &quot;Shooting at the Moon&quot; release. Her second album, &quot;Songs for the Gentle Man&quot;, was produced by Ron Geesin and released in 1971. This album was a significant step up from her debut, and contained string arrangements mostly by Geesin himself, particularly striking on the opening track &quot;A Day A Way&quot; and &quot;Seagull- Sunday.&quot; Her third album &quot;Thank You For...&quot;, released in 1972, was even more ambitious and used more musicians with a folk-rock sound. The album was her last album for John Peel&#x27;s Dandelion label, however, which folded due to its artists&#x27; lack of commercial success. St John&#x27;s adventurous fourth album &quot;Jumblequeen&quot;, released through Chrysalis Records in 1974, garnered critical praise in &quot;Spare Rib&quot;.

===Later years, 1975–present===
St John emigrated to Greenwich Village in 1976 and virtually disappeared from the public eye for over 20 years. She took part in the Strawbs 25th Anniversary festival held in 1993. St John released a &#x27;come-back&#x27; album in 1996, &quot;Take The Fifth&quot; and appeared at a Nick Drake tribute concert in New York City in 1999. She toured Japan in 2006 with the minimalist French musician Colleen, and appeared with the Electric Strawbs in the B.B. King Blues Club and Grill (NYC) on 27 June 2007.

Aside from work under her own name, St John has recorded with Mike Oldfield on his albums &quot;Ommadawn&quot; (1975) and &quot;Amarok&quot; (1990), and with Kevin Ayers and Robin Frederick. In 2007 she reunited with Ayers to record &quot;Baby Come Home&quot; on his album &quot;The Unfairground&quot;.

In 2008 she married Gordon Edwards, who served as the bass player for the 1970s jazz-funk band Stuff.

St John has toured with Michael Chapman, and in 2016 she recorded with Chapman for his &quot;50&quot; release.

She was described by John Peel as &quot;the best lady singer-songwriter in the country&quot;.

St John&#x27;s song &quot;Back to Stay&quot; is the opening credits soundtrack of the 2017 Korean film &quot;The Cage&quot; by Iranian-German director Lior Shamriz, lip-synced by queer Korean drag queen.

St John recorded the song &quot;Fly&quot; for &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s Nick Drake compilation album, &quot;Green Leaves: Nick Drake Covered&quot; (cover dated March 2018).

St John supported Will Sheff (Okkervil River) on the song &quot;Tommy McHugh&quot; released in 2023.

<text>The Deepest End, Live in Concert is a two-CD live album and DVD video by American southern rock band Gov&#x27;t Mule, released on October 7, 2003. It was recorded in New Orleans on May 3, 2003.

In 2003, after recording &quot;The Deep End, Volume 1&quot; (2001) and &quot;Volume 2&quot; (2002), Gov&#x27;t Mule gathered several musicians that had worked on the &quot;Deep End&quot; sessions as well as a few other friends for a live concert. This was intended as the culmination of the &quot;Deep End&quot; project, which was a tribute to their late bassist Allen Woody, who died in 2000. The release also marked the first Gov&#x27;t Mule CD to feature keyboardist Danny Louis as a full-time member.

The album is one of the 10 best &quot;live jam releases of this century&quot; according to the August 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar One&quot; magazine.

<text>Miroirs (French for &quot;Mirrors&quot;) is a five-movement suite for solo piano written by French composer Maurice Ravel between 1904 and 1905. First performed by Ricardo Viñes in 1906, &quot;Miroirs&quot; contains five movements, each dedicated to a fellow member of the French avant-garde artist group Les Apaches.

==History==
Around 1900, Maurice Ravel joined a group of innovative young artists, poets, critics, and musicians referred to as Les Apaches or &quot;hooligans&quot;, a term coined by Ricardo Viñes to refer to his band of &quot;artistic outcasts&quot;. To pay tribute to his fellow artists, Ravel began composing &quot;Miroirs&quot; in 1904 and finished it the following year. It was first published by Eugène Demets in 1906. The third and fourth movements were subsequently orchestrated by Ravel, while the fifth was orchestrated by Percy Grainger, among others.

==Structure==
&quot;Miroirs&quot; has five movements, each dedicated to a member of &quot;Les Apaches&quot;:
==Orchestrated versions==
&quot;&quot;Une barque sur l&#x27;océan&quot; and &quot;Alborada del gracioso&quot; were orchestrated by Ravel himself. 

&quot;La vallée des cloches&quot; has been orchestrated by Ernesto Halffter for triple woodwind, four horns, timpani, percussion, two harps, celesta and strings; and by Percy Grainger for a typical Grainger ensemble with multiple pianos and percussion, plus strings. 

&quot;Oiseaux tristes&quot; has been scored by for double woodwind plus piccolo, two horns, two trumpets, percussion, harp, celesta and strings; though aimed at intermediate rather than advanced players, transposed down a semitone and with some of Ravel&#x27;s rhythms simplified. In 2001 American conductor Leif Bjaland orchestrated &quot;Oiseaux tristes&quot; scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, harp, and strings. 

The earliest known orchestration of &quot;Noctuelles&quot; is by the British pianist Michael Round, an orchestration commissioned by Vladimir Ashkenazy and recorded by him with the NHK Symphony Orchestra (Exxon, 1993). In orchestrated form &quot;Noctuelles&quot; is scored for triple woodwind (including E clarinet) minus one contrabassoon; four horns, three trumpets, three trombones and tuba, timpani, percussion, two harps, celesta and strings. There is a more recent orchestration (2001) of &quot;Noctuelles&quot; by American composer Steven Stucky. It is published by Theodore Presser Company and is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling English horn), 2 clarinets, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, 2 percussionists, celesta, two harps, and strings. 

In 2003 the British composer Simon Clarke made an orchestration of the three movements that Ravel did not orchestrate.

<text>The Los Angeles Aztecs were an American professional soccer team based in Los Angeles, California, that existed from 1974 to 1981. The Aztecs competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1974 to 1981 as well as the 1975 NASL Indoor tournament, the 1979–80 and 1980–81 NASL Indoor seasons, and won the NASL Championship in 1974. During their eight years of existence, the Aztecs played at four different venues and were controlled by four different ownership groups European soccer legends George Best and Johan Cruyff played for the team, and from 1975 to 1977 English singer Elton John was a part-owner.

==History==
===Founding and first season success===
In January 1974, looking to build off what was considered increasing public interest in professional soccer, the North American Soccer League (NASL) announced Los Angeles as one of six cities awarded an expansion team for the upcoming 1974 season. Jack Gregory, a local doctor and real estate investor, paid the franchise fee and acted as team owner and Alex Perolli was appointed the first head coach. 
After playing a series of pre-season friendlies against teams from Mexico, the Aztecs opened their first NASL season with a 2–1 win over the Seattle Sounders at the East Los Angeles College Stadium with 4,107 fans in attendance. After three consecutive victories to start the season, Perolli publicly criticized and then fired his starting goal keeper, Trinidad and Tobago international Kelvin Barclay, after he allowed three goals in the second half. The Aztecs finished the season with a record of 11 wins, 2 draws and 7 losses, averaging 5,098 fans per game, and winning first place in the Western Division . Forward Doug McMillan scored eleven goals and was named Rookie of the Year for the 1974 season, an honor he had separately won the previous season with the Cleveland Stars of the American Soccer League. Having earned a first round bye, the Aztecs defeated the Boston Minutemen 2–0 at home in the semi-finals. Having earned the most points during the season, Los Angeles should have hosted the NASL Final 1974; however, due to the CBS televised start time of 3:30 (EDT) and other factors, the game was moved to the Miami Orange Bowl. On August 25, 1974, with 15,507 people in attendance, the Los Angeles Aztecs and the Miami Toros played to a 3–3 draw in regular time, after which Los Angeles won the penalty shoot-out 5–3 to win the 1974 NASL Championship. It was the second year in a row that an expansion franchise and won the championship following the Philadelphia Atoms in 1973.

===New ownership===
Following the 1974 season, Alex Perolli left his position as head coach to take up the same job at the expansion San Antonio Thunder and owner Jack Gregory sold his interest in the team to a group headed by John Chaffetz. The new owners hired 25-year-old Terry Fisher, at the time the youngest coach in the NASL, giving him a two-year contract as head coach. That February, the team traded its first and second draft choices to the expansion Chicago Sting and drafted Michael Bain, two-time All-American and captain of the 1974 NCAA Division I Soccer champions Howard Bison. The Aztecs were one of the sixteen NASL teams to participate in the 1975 NASL Indoor tournament. In total, the Aztecs played three indoor matches in 1975, a pre-tournament tune-up match against the San Jose Earthquakes on February 14, and tournament matches against the Vancouver Whitecaps and Seattle Sounders.

The Aztecs opened the 1975 North American Soccer League season with a 2–1 victory on the road against the San Jose Earthquakes. The team&#x27;s first home sellout occurred on July 3, 1975, in a 5–1 rout of the Pelé led New York Cosmos, Uri Banhoffer scored a hat-trick and was named NASL player of the week for his performance. The team officially protested their 2 August 1975 2–1 overtime loss to Earthquakes stating crowd noise prevented head coach Fisher from communicating with his players between the end of regulation and the beginning of overtime. The team finished the season with a record of twelve wins and ten losses, ending in third place of the Western Division. Making the playoffs as a wild card after Chicago Sting lost their final game of the season to the Washington Diplomats, the Aztecs were defeated by the St. Louis Stars in a quarter-finals match that was decided by a penalty shoot-out.

===Best years===

Following the 1975 season, English singer Elton John, purchased a stake in the team, and was given permission by the league to sit on the bench during games. A few weeks later, Managing General Partner Chaffetz announced the team&#x27;s intention of signing 1968 Ballon d&#x27;Or winner George Best, who had been released by Manchester United. After some confusion in December between the team announcing Best&#x27;s signing and the player denying he had, George Best arrived in Los Angeles on February 20, 1976. The Aztecs opened the 1976 North American Soccer League season on the road with a 1–2 loss against the San Jose Earthquakes, Best scored his first of fifteen goals for the season on April 25, 1976, in the team&#x27;s home opener against the Rochester Lancers. Los Angeles finished the season in third place of the Pacific Conference Southern Division with a record of twelve wins and twelve losses. The Aztecs were defeated in the First Round of the playoffs 2–0 by the Dallas Tornado on August 18, 1976.

After playing the previous two seasons at Murdock Stadium on the campus of El Camino College, the team moved to the L.A. Coliseum for the 1977 season. The Aztecs began the 1977 North American Soccer League season on the road against the Earthquakes again, this time beating San Jose 3–0. On July 3, 1977, the largest home crowd of the season, 32,165, attended the game against the Cosmos, for Brazilian superstar Pelé&#x27;s last competitive appearance in Los Angeles. The Aztec won the game 4–1. The Aztecs finished the season in second place of the Pacific Conference Southern Division with a record of fifteen wins and eleven losses. The Aztecs were defeated by the Seattle Sounders in the Conference Championships after having beaten the Earthquakes in the first round, and Dallas Tornado over two-legs in the Division Championships.

After the season, the team was purchased by a group headed by Alan Rothenberg with former Los Angeles Lakers player Rudy LaRusso named general manager. The Aztecs also signed a lease to play its homes matches at the Rose Bowl for the 1978 North American Soccer League season. In the first game of the season, the Aztecs lost to the Houston Hurricane in a shoot-out after playing to a 2–2 draw. Rumor&#x27;s of Best&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle and various personal problems, including alcoholism, began to spread during the previous season. After missing two training sessions and meeting with the team owners to address his concerns with the direction of the club, Best skipped the team&#x27;s final practice before their May 10, 1978, match against the Oakland Stompers, and the team announced his indefinite suspension. The following month, the team traded Best to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, with the Aztecs receiving players George Dewsnip, Andy Rowland and the Strikers first 1980 draft choice. On June 6, 1978, and with a record of five wins in thirteen games, the Aztecs fired head coach Terry Fisher and replaced him with Tommy Smith. With only three wins during the next fourteen games, Smith was replaced by team Director of Personnel Peter Short for the final two games of the season. The Aztecs finished the season in last place of the National Conference Western Division, recording nine wins and twenty-one loses. It was the team&#x27;s worst outdoor season record and the only outdoor season the Aztecs did not qualify for the playoffs. The Aztecs did not participate in the 1978 NASL Skelly Indoor Invitational, but did play a few indoor exhibition games in March 1978.

===Michels &amp; Cruyff years===

On November 14, 1978, team president Larry Friend announced former FC Barcelona, AFC Ajax, and Dutch national team manager Rinus Michels had been hired as head coach. Michels revamped the team&#x27;s roster with only four players from the Aztecs 1978 team remaining on the roster for the 1979 NASL season. The Aztecs started the season with a record of five wins in seven games when on May 22, 1979, the team announced the signing of three-time Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Johan Cruyff on a $1.4 million contract over two years which also included a percentage of gate receipts, making Cruyff the highest paid athlete in Southern California. The Aztecs finished the season in second place of the National Conference Western Division with a record of eighteen wins and twelve losses. Prior to signing Cruyff, the Aztecs averaged 7,500 fans a game, but ended the season with an average attendance of 14,333. The Aztecs defeated the Washington Diplomats two games to none in the first round of the playoffs. The Aztecs won the home leg of the Conference Semifinals against the Vancouver Whitecaps in an overtime shootout, but lost the away leg and the 30 minute mini game. Cruyff was awarded the league MVP and Larry Hulcer was named the Rookie of the Year for the 1979 season.

From September through October 1979, the team embarked on a three-country European tour beginning with a 2–1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain F.C. The team then played six games in the Netherlands winning three, losing two and earning one draw. On the team&#x27;s final leg through England, the Aztec drew 1–1 against Birmingham City F.C. and lost 2–0 to Chelsea F.C. Mexican media company Televisa purchased the team in early 1980 and sold the team&#x27;s rights to Johan Cruyff to the Washington Diplomats for $1 million in order to save payroll money and foster a different image for the team. The Aztecs participated in the 1979–80 NASL Indoor season earning only two wins in twelve matches. A few weeks prior to the beginning of the 1980 outdoor season, Michels resigned has head coach, but was able to reach an agreement with the new owners and confirmed he would be returning. The Aztecs finished the 1980 season in second place of the National Conference Western Division with a record of twenty wins and twelve losses. Losing the first game of the Conference Quarterfinals at RFK Stadium the Aztecs defeated the Diplomats in the series by winning the home leg in a shootout, and the 30-minute minigame 2–0. The Aztecs advanced to the Conference Championships after defeating the Seattle Sounders in another shootout after each team won their home leg and playing to a 1–1 tie in the minigame. The Aztecs were defeated by the New York Cosmos in both games of the Conference Championships. Less than a month after the team was eliminated from the playoffs, Michels left the team for the position of technical director of FC Köln.

===Final season===
The Aztecs achieved their best indoor season record with eleven wins and seven loses and earning first place of the Western Division in the 1980–81 NASL Indoor season but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Edmonton Drillers. On January 9, 1981, the Aztecs announced Cláudio Coutinho had signed a two-year contract to coach the team. The team also moved back to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to play their home games for the 1981 outdoor season. The Aztecs finished the 1981 North American Soccer League season in second place of the Western Division with a record of nineteen wins and thirteen losses and an average attendance of 5,814. The team was knocked out of the first round of the playoffs by the Montreal Manic two games to one, the last game decided on a controversial penalty call in overtime. Following the season on December 9, 1981, Televisa released a statement stating the team would not be operating for the 1982 season and that any remaining player contracts would be sold.

<text>Billboard Dad is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed by Alan Metter starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. It was produced by Warner Bros. in collaboration with Dualstar Productions and Tapestry Films (now Screendoor).

==Plot==
Set in Los Angeles, California, the film revolves around 12-year-old twin sisters, Emily (a surfer girl) and Tess (a member of the high-diving team), as they try various strategies to get their widower father, Max (a talented artist and sculptor), a girlfriend.

After their first attempts end in failure, Tess and Emily team up with their friend, Cody, to paint an advertisement on a giant billboard situated high above Sunset Boulevard. Many women answer the advertisement through letters and through random chance, Max answers a letter submitted by a woman named Debbie.

Debbie brings along her friend Brooke as a back-up in preparation for the former&#x27;s date with Max. Brooke and Max coincidentally meet and take a liking to each other and Debbie agrees they should start dating. At first, Tess and Emily don&#x27;t like Brooke&#x27;s son, Ryan, a skater punk boy. But when an elaborate scheme by Max&#x27;s business manager, Nigel, to break up the romantic relationship between Max and Brooke arises, Ryan and the girls put aside their differences in order to foil the break-up plan.

<doc id="1213941" wikidata="Q2034682" url="?curid=1213941" title="2008 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 2008 Democratic National Convention was a quadrennial presidential nominating convention of the Democratic Party where it adopted its national platform and officially nominated its candidates for president and vice president. The convention was held in Denver, Colorado, from August 25 to 28, 2008, at the Pepsi Center. Senator Barack Obama from Illinois gave his acceptance speech on August 28 at Invesco Field in what the party called an &quot;Open Convention&quot;. Denver last hosted the Democratic National Convention in 1908. Obama became the party&#x27;s first nonwhite nominee, and nominee of African descent, for president. Senator Joe Biden from Delaware was nominated for vice president.

Obama officially received the nomination for president on August 27, when his former opponent, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, interrupted the official roll call to move that Obama be selected by acclamation. U.S. Senator Joe Biden of Delaware accepted the nomination for vice president on the same night. Obama accepted his nomination the following night in a speech at Invesco Field before a record-setting crowd of 84,000 people in attendance.

==Leadership==

Howard Dean presided over the political party in his capacity as Chair of the Democratic National Convention. From the national committee, Leah D. Daughtry served as chief executive of the Democratic National Convention Committee. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi served as permanent chair of the convention. Sharing in her responsibilities in the convention were three co-chairmen: Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, Texas State Senator Leticia R. Van de Putte, and Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin.

==Schedule==

Choosing to hold the convention the day after the Beijing Olympic Games concluded, the Democratic Party convened in Denver in the last week of August, a week before the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. The decision was made, according to the party, to &quot;maximize momentum for our Democratic ticket in the final months of the Presidential election&quot;. Customarily, the party of the incumbent president holds its convention after the opposing party has held their meeting.

The Democratic National Committee presented themes for each day of the convention. The August 25 theme was &quot;One Nation&quot;. The August 26 theme was &quot;Renewing America&#x27;s Promise&quot; while its August 27 theme was &quot;Securing America&#x27;s Future&quot;. The August 28 theme highlights Obama&#x27;s campaign motto, &quot;Change We Can Believe In&quot;. Featured speakers crafted their messages to the theme of the day.

==Early party division==
With close delegate counts for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, there was early speculation of the first brokered convention in decades. Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean sought to avoid such a circumstance.

In addition to the possibility of a brokered convention, a dispute over seating delegates from Florida and Michigan led some to compare the year&#x27;s convention with the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which ended in a divided party and unhappiness over the outcome. This speculation ended when Obama was declared the presumptive nominee on June 3, 2008, and Clinton officially announced later that week that she was suspending her campaign and was fully endorsing Obama.

==Rules==
On February 2, 2007, the Democratic Party published &quot;Call for the 2008 Democratic National Convention,&quot; the rules governing the convention. There were 3,409.5 pledged delegates, those committed to vote for a particular candidate, selected by primary voters and caucus participants. There were about 823.5 unpledged delegates, those free to vote for any candidate, colloquially known as &quot;superdelegates&quot;, for a total of about 4,233 delegates, requiring 2,117 votes to constitute a majority of the convention. The superdelegates consisted of DNC members, Democratic Congress members and Governors, and other prominent Democrats.

The pledged delegates were allocated among the states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, according to two main criteria: 1) proportion of votes each state gave the candidate in the last three presidential elections; and 2) percentage of votes each state has in the Electoral College. Fixed numbers of delegates were allocated for American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and Democrats Abroad. Under the party&#x27;s &quot;Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention&quot;, delegates were awarded through proportional representation with a minimum threshold of 15% of votes in a state or congressional district to receive delegates. The delegate population must reflect the state&#x27;s ethnic distribution, and at least 50% of the delegates must be women.

==Results of delegate voting==

Along with presumptive presidential nominee Barack Obama, former opponent Hillary Clinton&#x27;s name was also placed in the roll call vote for nomination. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that this has occurred before: Jerry Brown&#x27;s name was entered into the roll call after losing to Bill Clinton in 1992; Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart also had their names added after losing to Walter F. Mondale in 1984; while Jackson&#x27;s name was also entered into the roll call after losing to Michael Dukakis in 1988. In 1980, Senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s name was entered into the roll call after losing to Jimmy Carter. In addition, Clinton became only the fourth woman to have her name placed in nomination for president at a major party convention. (U.S. Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was placed in nomination at the 1964 Republican National Convention, and U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New York was placed in nomination at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. In 1976, anti-abortionist Ellen McCormack had her name placed in nomination along with Mo Udall, Jimmy Carter and Jerry Brown.) Clinton would have her name placed in nomination for president once more, in 2016, along with Bernie Sanders.
===President===
Part way through the roll call (the New Mexico delegation first yielded to the Illinois delegation, who then yielded to the New York delegation), Senator Clinton of New York stated, &quot;Madame Secretary, I move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote. All votes cast by the delegates will be counted, and that I move Senator Barack Obama of Illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the Democratic Party for president of the United States.&quot; This was done and the verbal roll call vote was halted. Earlier the same day, Clinton had released her delegates, allowing them to vote for Obama. Along with the verbal roll call, a paper ballot was taken. The results were 3,188.5 for Obama and 1,010.5 for Clinton. There are an additional 219 votes that were not cast.

===Vice president===
Joe Biden was nominated by acclamation.

==Venue==


===Site selection===
In late November 2005, 35 locations were invited by the DNC to bid for the right to host the 2008 convention: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Memphis, Miami, Miami-Dade County, Milwaukee, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Nashville, New Orleans, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, St. Louis, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.

Eleven cities originally accepted the invitation to bid for the convention in January 2006: Anaheim, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, Minneapolis–St. Paul, New Orleans, New York City, Orlando, Phoenix, and San Antonio. A formal request for proposal was mailed to participating cities on February 27 and the deadline for cities to respond was May 19, 2006.

Only three cities submitted final proposals to host the convention: Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and New York. New Orleans had submitted an initial bid, but on July 12, the city dropped out. The cities were visited by a 10-member Technical Advisory Committee in June 2006. On September 27, the Republicans announced they would have their 2008 convention in St. Paul, removing it from consideration and leaving only Denver and New York as potential hosts. Despite hard lobbying by New York party boosters, then-Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg dealt the campaign a major blow when he announced the city lacked the financial means to support a convention. Denver was chosen as the host on January 11, 2007, as Democrats looked to make gains in the &quot;Purple West&quot; states of Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico.

===Preparations===
The work to prepare Pepsi Center for the Democratic National Convention was expected to cost $15 million. In addition, a temporary building to be used by the media was built near Pepsi Center.

Convention organizers, including the Democratic National Convention Committee and the Denver 2008 Convention Host Committee, expected 50,000 attendees, of whom 5,000 were delegates and 15,000 media personnel. However, they anticipated 75,000 people coming to watch Obama accept the nomination on Thursday.

The stage erected at Invesco Field for the convention&#x27;s final evening featured doric columns meant to evoke the White House&#x27;s neoclassical architecture. Some critics criticized this design as evoking imperial imagery.

===Labor issues===
The head of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local No. 7, Jim Taylor, refused to sign a no-strike agreement for the convention. Pepsi Center normally uses nonunion labor, but used Taylor&#x27;s union during the convention, and Taylor wanted Pepsi Center to use his union for all events.

===Security measures===
As with past political conventions since 2000, the Democratic National Convention was designated a National Special Security Event (NSSE) by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Denver Police Department doubled in size to 3,000 officers for the DNC, by including other police from 52 neighboring law enforcement agencies. Police were equipped with riot gear in preparation for unorganized protests. Throughout the event, a total of 152 arrests were made for offenses related to the convention.

==Principal speakers==

===Monday, August 25===

The theme for the day was &quot;One Nation,&quot; with Michelle Obama as the &quot;headline prime-time speaker.&quot; She was introduced by her brother, Craig Robinson. In her speech, she explained how her husband embraced the &quot;One Nation&quot; idea:
See, that&#x27;s why Barack&#x27;s running: to end the war in Iraq responsibly...
... to build an economy that lifts every family, to make sure health care is available for every American, and to make sure that every single child in this nation has a world-class education all the way from preschool to college.
That&#x27;s what Barack Obama will do as president of the United States of America.
He&#x27;ll achieve these goals the same way he always has, by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are. You see, Barack doesn&#x27;t care where you&#x27;re from, or what your background is, or what party, if any, you belong to. See, that&#x27;s just not how he sees the world.
He knows that thread that connects us – our belief in America&#x27;s promise, our commitment to our children&#x27;s future – he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree.

Also, Maya Soetoro-Ng spoke briefly on growing up with her older brother Barack Obama, and brought an Asian-American presence to the stage for the first time. &quot;The Work to Come: A Tribute to Senator Edward Kennedy&quot;, directed and produced by Mark Herzog and Chris Cowen in association with Ken Burns, was introduced by Kennedy&#x27;s niece, Caroline Kennedy. Consistent with the theme of the evening, Former Republican congressman Jim Leach gave his public endorsement of Barack Obama. His speech was introduced by Senator Tom Harkin, a fellow Iowan. Senator Kennedy was not expected to attend the convention due to his illness, but nevertheless made a surprise appearance and speech in the evening. A video about former President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s humanitarian work was also shown, followed by a brief appearance by the president himself.

===Tuesday, August 26===
The theme for the day was &quot;Renewing America&#x27;s Promise.&quot; Senator Barbara Mikulski was one of several elected women Democrats selected to speak that evening. Senator Hillary Clinton was the headline prime-time speaker. In her speech, with former President Bill Clinton watching, Hillary declared, &quot;We are on the same team.&quot;
Former Virginia Governor Mark Warner delivered the keynote address which included references to new job creation:
That&#x27;s a story worth rewriting all across America. With the right
leadership, we can once again achieve a standard of living that is
improved – and not diminished – in each generation. We can once again make
America a beacon for science and technology and discovery. Ladies and gentlemen, we know how to do it. The American people are ready.
And Barack Obama and Joe Biden will get it done.

Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich, who had also run as a presidential candidate in the 2008 Democratic Party primaries, gave a spirited speech structured around the refrain &quot;Wake up America!&quot; The speech levies trenchant criticism of the perceived abuses of power of the George W. Bush administration, attacks the corporate control of the American political and economic systems and rallies for a program of universal health coverage, universal higher education, tax reform, trade policy reform, energy regulation, civil liberties and de-militarization. At the end of the speech, Kucinich endorses Barack Obama and Joe Biden for president and vice-president. His words electrified the audience who began delivering a standing ovation midway through the speech and continued cheering past its closure.

===Wednesday, August 27===
The theme for the day was &quot;Securing America&#x27;s Future&quot;. It featured a speech by Joe Biden, the vice presidential candidate. Before his speech he was introduced by his oldest son Beau Biden, Delaware&#x27;s Attorney General.

In that speech Beau talked about how his father would tuck him and his siblings into bed each night after returning home, how he refused invitations to cocktail parties in DC because he did not want to miss his granddaughter (Beau&#x27;s daughter) Natalie&#x27;s birthday. He remembered the accident that killed his mother and sister and how his father took the Senate oath at his and his brother&#x27;s bedside. Several years later his father remarried &quot;their Mom Jill&quot; and their family was rebuilt. In the end Beau, whose Delaware National Guard unit where he is Captain was to be deployed to Iraq, said that while his father was always there for him, his duties that fall would prevent him from being there for his Dad. Thus he asked his family and everyone else to be there in November for his father and to be there for Barack Obama and make this country better again.

Joe Biden, in his speech, contrasted the two presidential candidates:

You know, you can learn a lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him, seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind. But even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.
I watched how Barack touched people, how he inspired them. And I realized he had tapped into the oldest belief in America: We don&#x27;t have to accept the situation we cannot bear; we have the power to change it.
And change it – and changing it is exactly what Barack Obama will do. That&#x27;s what he&#x27;ll do for this country.
You know, John McCain is my friend. And I know you hear that phrase used all the time in politics. I mean it. John McCain is my friend. We&#x27;ve traveled the world together. It&#x27;s a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by John still amazes me.
But I profoundly – I profoundly disagree with the direction John wants to take this country, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Amtrak to veterans. John thinks that, during the Bush years, quote, &quot;We&#x27;ve made great economic progress.&quot; I think it&#x27;s been abysmal. And in the Senate, John has voted with President Bush 95 percent. And that is very hard to believe.
Other speakers included former president Bill Clinton, 2004 presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry (MA), and Sen. Evan Bayh (IN). In his remarks, Clinton assessed Obama&#x27;s readiness to be president:
Clearly, the job of the next president is to rebuild the American dream and to restore American leadership in the world.
And here&#x27;s what I have to say about that. Everything I learned in my eight years as president, and in the work I have done since in America and across the globe, has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job.
Now, he has a remarkable ability to inspire people, to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose. He has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs. His policies on the economy, on taxes, on health care, on energy are far superior to the Republican alternatives.
He has shown – he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military. His family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an ever more interdependent world.
The long, hard primary tested and strengthened him. And in his first presidential decision, the selection of a running mate, he hit it out of the park.
With Joe Biden&#x27;s experience and wisdom, supporting Barack Obama&#x27;s proven understanding, instincts, and insight, America will have the national security leadership we need.
After Joe Biden spoke, his first address as vice presidential nominee, Barack Obama made a surprise appearance praising the convention.

===Thursday, August 28===
The convention moved to Invesco Field at Mile High, with a DNCC record crowd of more than 84,000 people in attendance. Speakers included former Vice President Al Gore, Governor of Virginia Tim Kaine, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, and the evening culminated in Barack Obama&#x27;s acceptance speech. More than 38 million people across 10 U.S. cable and broadcast TV networks tuned in to watch.

In his speech, Obama said, &quot;Our government should work for us, not against us. It should ensure opportunity, not for just those with the most money and influence, but for every American who is willing to work. That&#x27;s the promise of America, the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise and fall as one nation, the fundamental belief that I am my brother&#x27;s keeper, I am my sister&#x27;s keeper. That&#x27;s the promise we need to keep, that&#x27;s the change we need right now.&quot; The speech was well received, one news source calling it &quot;The wrap-up to the party convention blended old-fashioned speechmaking, Hollywood-quality stagecraft and innovative, Internet age politics.&quot;

==Controversies==

===Seating of delegates from Florida and Michigan===
The Florida and Michigan legislatures moved forward their primaries to January 2008, in contravention of party rules and were stripped of their delegates. The Clinton campaign with others initially opposed their seating, stating they acknowledged that the delegates from neither Michigan nor Florida would count. However, after winning the Florida and Michigan primaries, Senator Clinton spoke in favor of seating the states&#x27; delegates (despite Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Richardson, and John Edwards having removed their names from the Michigan primary ballot). DNC Chair Howard Dean asked Florida and Michigan to submit a new plan for a process to choose the delegates, such as holding primaries again, or let the matter be referred to the Credentials Committee. In May 2008, the rules committee agreed to let their delegates have half a vote each. In August 2008, Senator Barack Obama, the party&#x27;s presumptive nominee, asked the credentials committee to let the two states have full voting rights at the convention. The credentials committee met on August 24, the day before the convention began, and voted to restore full voting rights to Florida and Michigan.

===Use of municipal fuel by convention planners===
From March through July, convention planners were provided subsidized and untaxed fuel from municipal government gas pumps at a price less than retail fuel available to ordinary citizens, reportedly without a signed contract. After the practice became public at a meeting with city council members, only convention planners&#x27; buses were allowed to refuel at city facilities.

===Lawsuit by protesters===
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of 12 organizations who planned to protest at the Democratic Convention, requesting that the Secret Service and Denver officials release information about procedures concerning protesting times and the Demonstration Zone. In a June 12 release, a parade route and Demonstration Zone were announced. The Demonstration Zone will be in Parking Lot A of Pepsi Center. Some groups, including two groups opposing abortion chose to delay filing suit after it was announced that their applications for permits are being processed. In an amended complaint, the ACLU and interested advocacy groups have filed suit against the Secret Service and the city and county of Denver, questioning the constitutionality of the restrictions. The lawsuit failed and the ACLU did not appeal.

===Demonstration zone===
The official demonstration zone was unused on Monday afternoon, as the convention opened. The fenced area was from Pepsi Center and delegates could pass from 8 to from it.

===Gitmo on the Platte===
Gitmo on the Platte, was the colloquial name for the &quot;Temporary Arrestee Processing Center,&quot; Denver, CO set up to hold mass-arrested protesters during the 2008 Democratic National Convention which was held at the Pepsi Center in Denver from August 25 to August 28, 2008. It was so-named in reference to the conditions at Guantanamo Bay detention camp (aka &quot;Gitmo&quot;) and the processing center&#x27;s location near the South Platte River.

The Denver Police Department claimed the facility was set up to allow those arrested to be processed and released in a more timely manner than they would if they were to be transferred to the Denver County Jail, but faced substantial criticism in mainstream media.

===Suspected assassination plot===

On August 24, three men were arrested in the Denver, Colorado area on drugs and weapons charges. Following the arrests of Shawn Robert Adolf, Tharin Robert Gartrell and Nathan Johnson, a possible plot to assassinate Senator Obama surfaced. Authorities later said they had determined the trio posed no credible danger to Obama; U.S. Attorney Troy Eid said, &quot;We&#x27;re absolutely confident that the meth heads were not a true threat to the candidate, the Democratic National Convention or the people of Colorado.&quot;

===Arrest of an ABC News reporter===
A reporter from ABC News was arrested as he was photographing a meeting of Democratic senators and VIP donors. The reporter, Asa Eslocker, was arrested by the Denver police and charged with trespassing, interference, and failure to follow a lawful order. The charges were dismissed by the Denver city attorney.

===Abortion protest sign===

On August 26, 2008, a group of anti-abortion activists from American Right to Life Action constructed a sign on Table Mountain outside Denver, overlooking the convention. The sign, made of 2400 sheets, read &quot;Destroys / uNborn / Children&quot; in three rows; it was lined up so that &quot;DNC&quot; appeared vertically in a different color. Later that day, the protesters were asked by the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Department to remove the sign. No citations were issued, though the group did violate two open space regulations of not applying for a special activity permit and going into a restricted and closed area that is considered sensitive to wildlife.

===Website===
Microsoft was chosen as the web content provider for the convention web site, along with Vertigo Software as the developer. The video application developed was based on Microsoft&#x27;s Silverlight platform and provided high-definition video streams. The choice of technology that required proprietary software from a company with a history of antitrust problems was criticized for both the exclusion of competing platforms by way of Silverlight&#x27;s proprietary video codec and for requiring visitors to install the software when visiting the site. Although Moonlight is a cross-platform alternative that attempts to be compatible with Silverlight, as of the time of the convention it did not support features found in version 2 which were required. In contrast, the web site for the 2008 Republican National Convention used Adobe Flash streams provided through Ustream.TV and YouTube which are viewable with several applications including the free software cross-platform clone Gnash.

==Depiction in media==
Ava DuVernay was commissioned by the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture to create a film which debuted at the museum&#x27;s opening on September 24, 2016. This film, &quot;August 28: A Day in the Life of a People&quot;, tells of six significant events in African-American history that happened on the same date, August 28. The 22-minute film stars Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, Don Cheadle, Regina King, David Oyelowo, Angela Bassett, Michael Ealy, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, André Holland and Glynn Turman. Events depicted include, among other things, the night Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for president at the convention.

<text>The Shelby Daytona Coupe (also referred to as the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe) is an American sports-coupé. It is related to the Shelby Cobra roadster, loosely based on its chassis and drive-train developed and built as an advanced evolution. It was engineered and purpose built for auto racing, specifically to take on Ferrari and its 250 GTO in the GT class. The original project had six Shelby Daytona Coupes built for racing purposes between 1964 and 1965, as Carroll Shelby was reassigned to the Ford GT40 project to compete at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, again to beat Ferrari in the highest level prototype class. 

Shelby won a title in the International Championship for GT Manufacturers in the 1965 season with the Shelby Daytona car, thus becoming the first American constructor to win a title on the international scene at the FIA World Championships. In 2014, the first Cobra Daytona Coupe became the first vehicle recorded under a U.S. federal program for documenting historically important national treasures.

==Racing success==
During 1964 and 1965, Ford entered their six Shelby Daytona Coupes in numerous races through the British Alan Mann Racing Ford factory team, as well as temporarily selling or leasing to other racing teams such as &quot;Tri-Colore&quot; of France and Scuderia Filipinetti of Switzerland.

During this period, Shelby Daytona Coupes raced in GT Division III, for engine displacements over 2000 cc. They competed at numerous 500 km, 1000 km, 2000 km, 12 hour and 24 hour races on the International Championship for GT Manufacturers series, including events at Le Mans, Daytona, Sebring, Imola, Reims, Spa Francorchamps, Goodwood Circuit, Oulton Park, Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, the multi-race Tour de France Automobile, Enna, Rouen, Monza, and Nürburgring.

The Shelby Daytona Coupes, in their first year of competition, finished second (to Ferrari, by 6 points) in GT III class in the 1964 International Championship for GT Manufacturers. The Shelby Daytona Coupes won the GT III class (by 19 points) for the 1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers.

A partial list of competitions and results includes:
* 1964 12 Hours of Sebring (GT class win, fourth overall, Dave MacDonald/Bob Holbert)
* 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans (GT class win, fourth overall, Dan Gurney/Bob Bondurant)
* 1964 RAC Tourist Trophy (GT class win)
* 1965 24 Hours of Daytona (GT class win)
* 1965 12 Hours of Sebring (GT class win)
* 1965 Italian Grand Prix at Monza (GT class win)
* 1965 Nürburgring 1000 km (GT class win)
* 1965 12 Hours of Reims (GT class win, clinched 1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers)
* 1965 Enna-Pergusa (GT class win)
* 1965 25 land speed records at Bonneville

== The Ferrari/Mulsanne problem ==

Carroll Shelby, after winning Le Mans in 1959, wanted to return to Europe to beat Enzo Ferrari at Le Mans with a car of his own design. Having developed the AC Cobra/Shelby Cobra into a successful GT race car, he realised that the weakness of the open-cockpit sports cars at Le Mans was the aerodynamic drag which limited top speed on the long Mulsanne Straight to around , nearly less than the Ferrari 250 GTO, which itself could hold speeds of circa . Given the length of this straight, this speed differential represented a loss of over 10 seconds per lap which could negate any power and acceleration advantage that the Cobra had in the slower sections.

Shelby asked employee Pete Brock to design the Daytona&#x27;s aerodynamic bodywork and Bob Negstad to design the car&#x27;s suspension. Negstad also designed the chassis and suspension for the GT40 and the CSX 3000 series Shelby Cobra, often referred to as the &quot;coil-Spring Cobra&quot; chassis.

After sketching the proposed design on the floor of the Shelby America workshop, starting with the roadster chassis crashed at the 1963 Le Mans race, Brock removed the bodywork and placed a seat and steering wheel in alignment of where he felt that they should be. He then placed driver Ken Miles in the car, and using scrap wood and gaffer tape, designed the windscreen - the first component to be manufactured for the car. He then interspaced wooden formers and, using these as a guide, hand-made the aluminum bodywork for chassis #CSX2287 around them.

Shelby conferred with an aerodynamics consultant from Convair, Ben Howard, who said that the design needed to be extended on the tail by at least , but Brock stood by his design. Shelby later said that, in hindsight, the extension would have been &quot;too much work&quot; and would have made the car too long, but that Howard had been right all along. Miles took the car to the Riverside Raceway, and on the main straight, took the car on his first five laps to , admittedly after it had been found to have &quot;almost flown, lightening the steering a great deal&quot; at speeds above . It took another 30 days of development before Miles signed off the car, clocked at that point capable of speeds over . CSX2287 was transported to Daytona Speedway for its debut race in the February 16, 1964 Daytona Continental 2000 km. Driver Dave MacDonald earned the pole position with a time of 2:08.200 and average speed of .

==Chassis numbers==

The first Shelby Daytona Coupe was built at the Shelby American race shop in Venice, California. The remaining five were built at Carrozzeria Gransport (Italian for &quot;Grand Sport Coachbuilders&quot;) in Modena, Italy.

A seventh semi-related car, the 427 &quot;Type 65&quot; Shelby Daytona Super Coupe # CSB3054 prototype that was developed but never officially completed by Shelby, is not included in this article.

=== Chassis # CSX2286 ===
Build #CSX2286, was built as a one-off special for the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans race however it never made it to the race. Carroll Shelby told a fictitious version of the story, claiming that it had an accident when being put on the truck to go to Le Mans. The truth was that the car was never finished. 

The original plan with CSX2286 was to lengthen the chassis and modify the car so that the 289 cu in Ford engine could be replaced with a NASCAR inspired big block. New Zealander John Ohlsen, who worked for Shelby on the original Daytona Coupe prototype (chassis #CSX2287) with Pete Brock and Ken Miles, modified the chassis used for the build at Shelby’s Venice shop. The car was then shipped to Italy, where Ohlsen was meant to oversee the installation of a Ford aluminium 427 cu in block. Citing concerns about overheating Ford reneged on the 427 and instead provided a 390, which Ohlsen installed. Time ran out on the build after the remaining long list of parts from Ford never arrived. Instead, another build, chassis #CSX2299, was used at the race with Ohlsen as crew chief and the car driven by Bob Bondurant and Dan Gurney. This car finished fourth in the main race but won in the GT class. CSX2286 was returned to California, returned to stock, and was raced at Le Mans the following year with drivers Gurney and Jerry Grant. Due to clutch trouble it failed to finish.

Owned and successfully vintage raced by S. Robson Walton, but crashed at Laguna Seca Raceway in August 2012. The car has since been repaired and fully restored.

=== Chassis # CSX2287 - The Original ===

Chassis #CSX2287 was the very first prototype Cobra Daytona Coupe, and is the only coupe that was built entirely at the Shelby American race shop in Venice, California. It was designed by Pete Brock, based on German engineering designs for an aerodynamic race car, dating back to the late 1930s. The plans were thought by Brock to have been lost during World War II however copies of the original German plans were found in the archive stores at Ford. Brock used these as the basis for the new design. Brock, driver Ken Miles, and fabricator John Ohlsen were the original members of the project. The design was initially snubbed by the rest of the Shelby team but after the car started to take shape and driving tests showed impressive results, the rest of the team got on board with the project to help finish it. In the May 2020 issue of &quot;Classic Motorsports&quot; Brock recounted &quot;...In spite of all the internal dissension, Ohlsen, Miles and I persevered. We led a small group of shop converts into building our first Daytona Coupe in 90 days!&quot;

CSX2287 has an extensive race history, competing at Daytona, Sebring, Reims, Spa Francorchamps, Oulton Park TT, Le Mans, Tour de France and Bonneville Salt Flats. It was driven by Dave MacDonald, Bob Holbert, Jo Schlesser, Phil Hill, Jochen Neerpasch, Chris Amon, Innes Ireland, André Simon, Maurice Dupeyron, Bob Johnson and Tom Payne.
Chassis CSX2287 won the GT class at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March 1964 with MacDonald and Holbert behind the wheel. The race at Sebring marked the first victory for a Cobra Daytona Coupe. At Le Mans in June 1964, the car was finished in Viking Blue metallic very distinctive white painted front fenders. The drivers were Amon and Neerpasch. They led the GT class until the car was disqualified in the 10th hour for an illegal jump start due to battery and alternator failure.

This coupe ended its racing career by setting 25 USAC/FIA world records at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, in November 1965, while driven by Craig Breedlove, Bobby Tatroe and Tom Greatorex during a Goodyear tire testing session. Shortly thereafter, it was reconditioned and was advertised for sale.

Slot car racing magnate Jim Russell bought the car from Shelby in 1966 after seeing an ad in the newspaper, for about $4-$5k. Russell eventually listed the car for sale and music producer Phil Spector bought it from him. The car was not suited for street driving, 
however certain features were added including traditional rear-exit mufflers and interior carpeting, in order to make it more user-friendly. It is unknown if these were added by Spector or Russell.

Built for high-speed racing, the cab became uncomfortably warm at low speeds, among other problems. Still, Spector drove it on the streets, and legend is that Spector racked up so many speeding tickets, his lawyer advised him to get rid of the car before he lost his license.

The car made an appearance in a 1968 episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot;, where it was driven against the Monkeemobile in a race. The car was given an iron cross on the &#x27;meatball&#x27;.

All trace of CSX2287 was lost by the mid-1970s, with car historians and collectors fearing the car had been destroyed. In 2001 the car was rediscovered in a rental storage unit in California. The owner Donna O&#x27;Hara had committed suicide by burning herself alive. The car had remained undiscovered for almost 30 years. Due to its estimated worth of over $4,000,000 the car was part of an extensive legal battle between her mother who sold the car to Dr. Frederick A. Simeone, and a friend of Ms O&#x27;Hara who was the recipient in her will of the contents of the storage unit. 

CSX2287 is restored. It has been preserved and mechanically reconditioned. It is part of the permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA.

In January 2014 CSX2287 became the first vehicle added to the Historic Vehicle Association&#x27;s National Historic Vehicle Register in the United States. Concurrently it became the first automobile to be recorded under the United States Secretary of the Interior Standards for Heritage Documentation, kept on file in the Library of Congress. In November 2014, CSX2287 won the International Historic Motoring Awards &quot;Car of the Year&quot;, which is voted on by the public. In addition to being the first American car to win the award, the Cobra Daytona Coupe is also the first American car nominated for this award.

=== Chassis # CSX2299 ===

This was the second Coupe built and the first completed at Carrozzeria Gransport. It competed in nine FIA races (LeMans, Reims, Goodwood Tourist Trophy, Tour de France, Daytona, Sebring, Oulton Park TT, LeMans, Enna), won four FIA events (LeMans &#x27;64, Tourist Trophy &#x27;64, Daytona &#x27;65, Sebring &#x27;65) and one event during the Tour de France (Rouen). The car was driven through this period by Dan Gurney, Bob Bondurant, Maurice Trintignant, Bernard de St. Auban, Jo Schlesser, Hal Keck, Jack Sears and Dick Thompson. At LeMans in 1964, drivers Gurney and Bondurant, clocking over on the Mulsanne Straight, took First Place in the GT III Class.

CSX2299 was painted Viking Blue with two white stripes in 1964 and repainted Guardsman Blue with two larger longitudinal white stripes and a transverse white stripe across the nose in 1965. In 1964 this car set lap records at Le Mans, Reims and Rouen and the race distance record at Le Mans and Goodwood. In 1965 the car set the lap record at Oulton Park.

CSX2299 was the last Daytona coupe sold by Shelby with a Bill of Sale which read &quot;the number one Cobra Daytona coupe&quot;. It is currently owned by Larry H. Miller Group and is displayed at the Shelby American Collection in Boulder, Colorado.

=== Chassis # CSX2300 ===

This Shelby Daytona Coupe was leased from Alan Mann Racing by Ford of France, to race as the national &quot;Tri-Colore&quot; entry in the 1965 Nurburgring 1000 km race, for which it was painted a white body finish with blue and red stripes. Well known French drivers André Simon and Jo Schlesser drove this coupe to 3rd in the GT 3 category (behind the GT winning Alan Mann entry driven by Bondurant and Neerpasch), and 12th overall. After the race, this white coupe was returned to Alan Mann Racing and was repainted in the official Guardsman Blue metallic and white stripe of the 1965 Shelby American team. Carroll Shelby himself owned this Daytona before it was sold by RM Auctions for $4.4 million on August 19, 2000.
=== Chassis # CSX2601 ===

This was the fourth Coupe built and the third completed at Carrozzeria Gransport. It competed in eight FIA races in 1965 (Daytona, Sebring, Monza, Spa, Nürburgring, LeMans, Reims, Enna), won four times in GT III class (Monza, Nürburgring, Reims, Enna), and driven by Bob Johnson, Tom Payne, Bob Bondurant, Allen Grant, Jochen Neerpasch and Jo Schlesser.
At Reims, 3–4 July 1965, drivers were Bondurant and Schlesser. It was painted Guardsman Blue. They won the GT III Class, while also earning the points needed to secure the 1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers.

This car was featured in the 1965 film &quot;Red Line 7000&quot;, then was purchased by its driver Bob Bondurant, who sold it in 1969. The car sold for $7.25 million on August 15, 2009, and it is currently owned by Perez Companc family from Argentina.

=== Chassis # CSX2602 ===

This was the fifth Shelby Coupe built and the fourth completed at Carrozzeria Gransport. It competed in six 1965 races (Daytona, Sebring, Monza, Spa, Nürburgring and LeMans) and was driven by Rick Muther, John Timanus, Lew Spencer, Jim Adams, Phil Hill, Jack Sears, John Whitmore, Peter Sutcliffe and Peter Harper. Prior to the Le Mans race, chassis CSX 2602 was also raced at Daytona (driven by Muther and Timanus) in 1965, Sebring (driven by Spencer, Adams, and Hill) in 1965, Monza (driven by Sears and Whitmore) in 1965, and Nurburgring (driven by Sears and Gardner) also in 1965.

Racing with the #59 at Le Mans on June 19–20, 1965, British drivers Sutcliffe and Harper ran CSX2602 with the distinctive Red &amp; White Swiss colors for the famous Swiss racing team &quot;Scuderia Filipinetti&quot;. The latter had already earned a reputation for themselves racing Ferraris. When Ford used up their allotment of entries for the 1965 Le Mans race, they asked team owner Georges Filipinetti to buy a Shelby Coupe from Alan Mann Racing and race it as his own annual entry. The red and white Cobra ran until the 10th hour, when a blown engine put it out of the race. After Le Mans, chassis CSX2602 was returned to Alan Mann Racing. It was repainted in the Shelby American team colors and never raced again.

==Continuation model==

In July 2015 Shelby American announced that they would produce a limited run of 50 continuation Daytonas to honor the 50th anniversary of the Daytona&#x27;s win in the International Championship for GT Manufacturers. Some of the 50 are to be aluminum-bodied, while others will have cheaper fiberglass bodies.

==Ford Shelby GR-1==

In 2004 Ford and Shelby created a sports coupe dubbed the Ford Shelby GR-1, with a sleek body and the new V10 powering the new Shelby Cobra. Carroll Shelby has explained that he does not want it to be called a Cobra, but it does bear resemblance to the Daytona.

<text>Rivne (; , ) is a city in western Ukraine. The city is the administrative center of Rivne Oblast (province), as well as the Rivne Raion (district) within the oblast. It has a population of 

In the spring of 1919, it also served as a provisional seat of the Ukrainian government throughout the ongoing war with Soviet Russia. Between World War I and World War II, the city was located in Poland as a district-level (county) seat in Wolyn Voivodeship. At the start of World War II in 1939, Rivne was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and received its current status by becoming a seat of regional government of the Rivne Oblast which was created out of the eastern portion of the voivodeship. During the German occupation of 1941–44 the city was designated as a capital of German Ukraine (Reichskommissariat Ukraine).

Rivne is an important transportation hub, with the international Rivne Airport, and rail links to Zdolbuniv, Sarny, and Kovel, as well as highways linking it with Brest, Kyiv and Lviv. Among other leading companies there is a chemical factory of Rivne-Azot (part of Ostchem Holding).

==History==
===Middle Ages===
Rivne was first mentioned in 1283 in the Polish annals &quot;Rocznik kapituły krakowskiej&quot; as one of the inhabited places of Halych-Volhynia near which Leszek II the Black was victorious over a part of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army. Following the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia&#x27;s partition after Galicia–Volhynia Wars in the late 14th century, it was under the rule of Grand Duchy of Lithuania and in 1434 the Grand Duke of Lithuania Švitrigaila awarded the settlement to a Lutsk nobleman Dychko. In 1461 Dychko sold his settlement to Prince Semen Nesvizh. In 1479 Semen Nesvizh died and his settlement was passed to his wife Maria who started to call herself princess of Rivne. She turned the settlement into a princely residence by building in 1481 a castle on one of local river islands and managed to obtain Magdeburg rights for the settlement in 1492 from the King of Poland Casimir IV Jagiellon. Following her death in 1518, the city was passed on to the princes of Ostrog and declined by losing its status as a princely residency.

In 1566 the town of Rivne became part of newly established Volhynian Voivodeship. Following the Union of Lublin in 1569, it was transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Kingdom of Poland. The city had a status of a private town held by nobles (Ostrogski and Lubomirski families). Following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 Rivne became a part of the Russian Empire, and in 1797 it was declared to be a county level (uyezd) town of the Volhynian Governorate.

===World War I===

During World War I and the period of chaos shortly after, it was briefly under German, Ukrainian, Bolshevik and Polish rule. During April–May 1919 Rivne served as the temporary capital of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. In late April 1919 one of the Ukrainian military leaders Volodymyr Oskilko attempted to organize a &quot;coup-d&#x27;état&quot; against the Directorate led by Symon Petliura and the cabinet of Borys Martos and replace them with Yevhen Petrushevych as president of Ukraine. In Rivne, Oskilko managed to arrest most of the cabinet ministers including Martos himself, but Petliura at that time was in neighboring Zdolbuniv and managed to stop Oskilko&#x27;s efforts. At the conclusion of the conflict, in accordance with the Riga Peace Treaty of 1921, it became a part of Polish Volhynian Voivodeship, a situation which would last until the Second World War. Before World War II, Rivne (Równe) was a mainly Jewish-Polish city (Jews constituted about 50% of the city&#x27;s population, and Poles 35%).

===World War II===
In 1939, as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the partition of Poland, Rivne was occupied by the Soviet Union. Starting December of that year Rivne became the center of the newly established Rivne Oblast in the Ukrainian SSR.
On 28 June 1941 Rivne was invaded by the 6th army of Nazi Germany. On 20 August, the Nazis declared it the administrative center of Reichskommissariat Ukraine. A Gestapo prison opened on Belaia Street. Roughly half of Rivne&#x27;s inhabitants were Jewish. 

On 6–8 November, 17,500 Jewish adults from Rivne were shot to death or thrown alive into a large pit in a pine grove in Sosenki, and 6,000 Jewish children suffered the same fate at a nearby site. From 8-13 November German actor Olaf Bach was flown to the city to perform for the German forces. The city&#x27;s remaining Jews were sent to Rivne Ghetto. In July 1942, they were sent north to Kostopil and shot to death.

On 2 February 1944, the city was captured by the Red Army in the Battle of Rivne, and remained under Soviet control until Ukraine regained its independence on the break-up of the USSR in 1991. Poles from Rivne were deported to Poland&#x27;s new borders after 1945.

===Post-war era===
In 1958, a TV tower began broadcasting in the city; in 1969, the first trolley ran through the city; in 1969, Rivne airport opened. In 1983, the city celebrated its 700th anniversary.

On 11 June 1991, the Ukrainian parliament officially renamed the city Rivne according to the rules of Ukrainian orthography. It had previously been known as Rovno.

In 1992, a memorial complex was established at the site of the World War II massacre to commemorate the 17,500 Jews murdered there in November 1941 during the Holocaust, marking the mass grave with an obelisk inscribed in Yiddish, Hebrew and Ukrainian.

On 6 June 2012, the World War II Jewish burial site was vandalised, as part of an antisemitic attack.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
On 14 March 2022, Rivne TV Tower has experienced heavy missile attack by Russian troops. The tower was damaged and an administrative room was destroyed. As a result of attack 20 people were killed and nine injured.

Rivne has a moderate continental climate with cold, snowy winters and warm summers. Snow cover usually lasts from November until March. The average annual precipitation is June and July being the wettest months and January and February the driest.
==Industry==

During Soviet times the provincial town was transformed into an industrial center of the republic. There were two significant factories built. The first was a machine building and metal processing factory capable of producing high-voltage apparatus, tractor spare parts and others. The other was a chemical factory and synthetic materials fabrication plant. Light industry, including a linen plant and a textile mill, as well as food industries, including milk and meat processing plants and a vegetable preservation plant, have also been built. In addition the city became a production center for furniture and other building materials.

The city has a historical museum.

Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the monument for the Soviet hero Dmitry Medvedev was removed, and the Nikolai Kuznetsov monument was moved to another location within the city. Instead, in order to reflect the controversial history of the region the monuments for &quot;People who died in the honor of Ukraine&quot;, and &quot;Soldiers who died in local military battles&quot; were installed.

<doc id="1213982" wikidata="Q157055" url="?curid=1213982" title="Cherkasy">
<text>Cherkasy (, ) is a city in central Ukraine. Cherkasy serves as the administrative centre of Cherkasy Oblast as well as Cherkasy Raion within the oblast. The city has a population of 

Cherkasy is the cultural, educational and industrial centre of Cherkasy Oblast and Central Economical Region of Ukraine. Cherkasy has been known since the 13th century and played a great role in the history of Ukraine. The city was the centre of the land of the Cossacks; its citizens took part in Khmelnychchyna and Koliivshchyna Cossack and peasant rebellions.

The city is located on the right bank of Dnieper River (specifically at the Kremenchuk Reservoir), about south of the nation&#x27;s capital, Kyiv. Cherkasy is divided into 2 urban districts: Sosnivskyi (with Orshanets village) and Prydniprovskyi. It hosts the administration of Cherkasy urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. In June 2011, the city celebrated its 725th anniversary.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Cherkasy is situated on the high right bank of the Dnipro River, in the middle of the Kremenchuk Reservoir. Relief of the historical part of the city was influenced by Zamkova (Castle) mountain, where Cherkasy Castle was situated. The major part of Cherkasy occurs as lowlands.

The city occupies an area of . The city&#x27;s length is along the Kremenchuk Reservoir, while its widest point is only .

From the north-west, Cherkasy is surrounded by forest. Known as Cherkasy Forest, it is the biggest () natural pine forest in Ukraine.

=== Climate ===

The climate of Cherkasy is mild continental, with mild winters and warm summers.

The average temperature in the city is . Winters are usually cold and snowy (the average January temperature is ). Summers are dry and warm (the average temperature in July is ), with occasional highs reaching .

=== Ecology ===
The ecological situation in the city is quite stable. The cumulative pollution index is 7.56, average with other Ukrainian cities. The main pollutant in the city is &quot;Azot&quot; plant, so the nearby area (south-east part of the city) is the most polluted. The downtown area is heavily polluted as well, due to high traffic volume. The city itself is mostly clean of nuclear pollution from the Chernobyl disaster, although the northernmost part of Cherkasy may have been influenced a little.

== Demographics ==
According to the newest data, the number of inhabitants of Cherkasy is 284,479 as of 1 October 2015. This number is decreasing because of rising mortality rate, socio-economic situation, and the suburbanisation process in the region.

According to the 2001 census, Ukrainians made up 83.31% of the population, Russians 13.14% and Jews 0.55%. 46.4% are males, 53.6% are females. According to the data provided by the municipal health care department, teens under 14 encompass 15% of the population while pensioners are 19%, which indicates the prevalence of aging citizens as compared to younger citizens.
=== Language ===
Distribution of the population by native language according to the 2001 census:

According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April-May 2023, 80 % of the city&#x27;s population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 18 % spoke Russian.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The history of Cherkasy has not been thoroughly explored. The year of establishment is considered by historians to be 1286 on the Kievan Rus&#x27; territory. There are few facts about the beginning of the city, but it is documented that Cherkasy existed in the 14th century. The first record about Cherkasy dates from 1305 in the &quot;Gustynskiy Chronicle&quot;, which is the Kievan Rus&#x27; chronicle. The city is mentioned as an existing city among other Kievan Rus&#x27; cities, including Kiev, Kaniv, Zhytomyr and Ovruch.

The city became one of the centres of the Cossack movement. Citizens took part in the Khmelnychchyna of 1648-1657 and in the Koliivschyna of 1768–1769. The city was influenced by the cruel social and economical experiments of Soviet authorities and by World War II. In 1954 Cherkasy became the administrative centre of Cherkasy Oblast (province), the youngest oblast of Ukraine.

=== Under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===

In the 1360s the city entered a new period in its development, becoming a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Cherkasy became an important defender of the southern borders of the Grand Duchy. In 1384 the city was recognized as a fortified town on the southern edge (of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), forming along with Vinnytsia, Bratslav and Kaniv part of a defensive line against Crimean Tatars. The city started to be ruled by a headman (starosta).

From the end of the 15th until the beginning of the 16th centuries, the post of was held by the prominent persons of that time – (in office: 1488–1495), (in office: 1494–1500), Vasyl Dashkevych (, in office: 1504–1507), Andriy Nemyrovych (in office: 1511–1514), Ostafiy Dashkevych (in office: 1514–1535), Vasyl Tyshkevych, Dmytro Baida-Vyshnevetskiy (in office: 1550–1553) etc.

During the 15th and 16th centuries Cherkasy was one of the main centres that helped the Cossacks in the peopling of the Ukrainian south. Citizens took part in military campaigns against Tatars and Turks, including operations led by Ivan Pidkova (died 1578). New Cherkasy Castle, built in 1549–52 on the place of the old one, was the centre of city life.

=== Under Polish rule, Khmelnytsky Uprising ===

After the Union of Lublin in 1569 Cherkasy became a part of Poland. Cherkasy Regiment, which was created in 1625, played a big role in history of the city. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising the regiment became administrative-territorial subdivision (until 1686). During that time Cherkasy&#x27;s Regiment was one of the most powerful military units and took part in all of the battles for Bohdan Khmelnytsky army. After a successful campaign, Khmelnytsky in 1654 signed an alliance with Muscovy at Pereyaslav. The war ended in 1667 with the Truce of Andrusovo. Cherkasy remained part of Poland, but territories east of the Dnieper River including left-bank Ukraine and Zaporizhia were secured for Muscovy.
While in the Polish Kingdom the city was a seat of the county (powiat) which belonged to a greater unit – the Kyiv Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province until 1793. In 1768 during the Koliyivshchyna turmoils the city was severely damaged and pillaged. In 1791 the city gained Magdeburg rights. It was a royal city of Poland. After the Second Partition of Poland the city was incorporated into the Kievan Guberniya of Imperial Russia.

=== 19th – early 20th centuries ===

Since the beginning of the 19th century the city was planned by Russian architect, civil engineer and town planner of Scottish descent, William Heste. After the second division of Poland in 1793, Cherkasy became part of the Russian Empire. From 1797 it was a town of Kyiv Governorate. In the second half of the 19th century the city experienced a great economical growth. After the railroad appeared in the city, a lot of new industrial enterprises were built. Sugar, tobacco, metalwork, mechanical engineering and trade industries were at peak development at that time. Architect William Heste made a general development plan for the city, which involved building square blocks with straight streets.

=== Ukrainian War of Independence, Second World War and Soviet period ===

After the October Revolution in 1917 Cherkasy fell under Bolshevik control. After that, however, the city changed its ruler at least 18 times – during the civil war it was conquered by hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, then again by Bolsheviks, later by Nykyfor Hryhoriv. On 1 January 1920, the city finally and for a long period fell under Soviet rule. As with all villages and towns in the area, it was a victim of man-made famine in 1932–1933 (Holodomor) and a Great Purge (a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union organised by Joseph Stalin in 1936–1938).

The Second World War damaged the city greatly. On 22 June 1941, German bombers attacked Cherkasy. For two months soldiers defended the city, but on 22 August, the invaders took the city. On 14 December 1943, Cherkasy was liberated from the German invaders. After the end of the war, the city began to recover after being almost obliterated. According to 5-year plans, the city began to re-develop its economy, infrastructure and socio-cultural sphere. In 1954 the city became the administrative centre of Cherkasy Oblast (province), the youngest among other oblasts in Ukraine. In the 1960s Cherkasy became the chemical giant of the Ukrainian SSR, after &quot;Azot&quot; (the biggest nitrogen fertilizer producing plant), &quot;Khimvolokno&quot; (artificial fiber manufacturing plant), &quot;Khimreaktyv&quot; (chemical reagents for military purposes) and many others were built in the city. In 1961 a Kremenchuk hydro power plant was built, forming the Kremenchuk Water Reservoir, which Cherkasy is now standing on. This makes the city a big transport hub, serving the longest dyke in Ukraine (15 km) with rail and road on it.

=== Independence from the Soviet Union ===
Since gaining independence, industry in the city has declined, along with the number of citizens and living standards. A lot of big and powerful factories and plants were privatized but couldn&#x27;t survive in a competitive market. Some enterprises changed their profile – several (3) factories and plants around the city were united under the &quot;Bogdan Corporation&quot; and started production of buses and cars. Some of the companies remained working and became successful, like &quot;Azot&quot;.
On 28 November 2008, the monument of Lenin was removed from the central square. This caused different reactions in different people. Now the central square, formerly called &quot;Lenin Square&quot;, is called &quot;Soborna Square&quot; (Cathedral Square). The square was recently renovated.
In 2009, Cherkasy airport received International Airport status (IATA: CKC – ICAO: UKKE).

Until 18 July 2020, Cherkasy was designated as a city of oblast significance and belonged to Cherkasy Municipality but not to Cherkasy Raion even though it was the centre of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Cherkasy Oblast to four, the city was merged into Cherkasy Raion.

The city has occasionally seen Russian air strikes and missile attacks as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but has so far been untouched by ground-based warfare.

== Transportation ==
=== Public transportation ===
Public transportation is represented by trolleybuses and buses. Trolleybuses started serving the city in 1965, and now are operating on 10 routes, from approximately 6 am till 11 pm. The fleet is old, and mostly consists of ZiU-9 and ZiU-10 vehicles. Recently, 3 new trolleybuses (manufactured by LAZ) appeared in the city. Buses are mostly represented with &quot;Etalon&quot;, &quot;Bohdan&quot;, and &quot;PAZ&quot; buses. Cherkasy City Bus is the authority that controls the buses in the city, it consists of several private contractors which actually operate the transport system.

=== Roads ===

Cherkasy is a big transport hub due to its location in the centre of the country.
Two major automobile routes go through the city –  H16  (Uman-Zolotonosha, national route) and  P10  (Kaniv-Kremenchuk, regional route). There is a 4-lane highway between Cherkasy and Smila (which is a part of Cherkasy Urban Agglomeration). The roads are in poor technical condition and road maintenance is poor.

=== Railways ===

The Cherkasy railway station is the main railway station that serves the city. The city also has a railway stop, and both are operated by the state-owned Ukrzaliznytsia company. Cherkasy has regular connections to neighbouring cities with small diesel trains. Major route Odesa-Moscow passes through Cherkasy. One of the most important railway junctions in Ukraine, is located from Cherkasy, in the city of Smila, where the Kyiv–Dnipro and Odesa–Moscow rail routes cross.

=== Air and Water transport ===
As Cherkasy is located on the bank of Kremenchuk reservoir, it has a small riverport. The previously extensive riverboat service along the Dnieper featuring the Raketa hydrofoil ships no longer exists, limiting river transport to cargo and tour boats and private pleasure craft. There is also a cargo port located in the city.

Cherkasy International Airport is located on the western edge of the city. It handles chartered flights around Ukraine, because Boryspil airport in Kyiv handles most of Ukraine&#x27;s International flights. In addition, Cherkasy airport is used as the alternative airport for Boryspil in case of unforeseen situations and adverse weather conditions.

== Economy ==
Cherkasy is an important economic centre of Ukraine. The city is presented with different industries, but traditionally the greatest development was reached in chemical industry, automotive industry and food industry. Total yield, generated by Cherkasy industries was near ₴7,894.3 billion, or 64% of total income of Cherkasy Oblast.

<text>Vinnytsia ( ; , ) is a city in west-central Ukraine, located on the banks of the Southern Bug. It serves as the administrative center of Vinnytsia Oblast. It is the largest city in the historic region of Podillia. It also serves as the administrative center of Vinnytsia Raion, one of the six raions of Vinnytsia Oblast. It has a population of 

The city&#x27;s roots date back to the Middle Ages. It was under Lithuanian and Polish control for centuries. From 1653 to 1667, Vinnytsia was a regimental city of the Hetman state, and in 1793, it was ceded to the Russian Empire. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the city was the site of massacres, first during Stalin&#x27;s purges and then during the Holocaust in Ukraine and the Nazi occupation. A Cold War–era airbase was located near the city. Currently, Vinnytsia is developing as one of the most comfortable cities for life in independent Ukraine.

==Name==

The name of Vinnytsia appeared for the first time in 1363. It is assumed that the name is derived from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;&quot; (&quot;вѣно&quot;), meaning &quot;a bride price.&quot; This name can be explained by the fact that Vinnytsia and the surrounding land were captured by Lithuanian Duke Algirdas in the 14th century, and then, they were given to his nephews.

In addition to the Ukrainian (&quot;Vinnytsia&quot;), in other languages of the region, the name of the city is , , , , and . English sources used the Russian-derived Vinnitsa from the early 19th century until the 1990s and Winnica or Winnicza (from Polish) before that, reflecting the ultimate political authorities of those respective eras.

==Geography==

===Location===
Vinnytsia is located about southwest of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, north-northwest of the Black Sea port city of Odesa, and east of Lviv.

It is the administrative center of Vinnytsia Oblast (province), as well as the administrative center of the surrounding Vinnytsia Raion within the oblast. The city itself is directly subordinated to the oblast.

===Climate===
The city has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;).

A long-lasting warm summer with a sufficient quantity of moisture and a comparatively short winter is characteristic of Vinnytsia. The average temperature in January is and in July. The average annual precipitation is .

Over the course of a year there are around 6–9 days when snowstorms occur, 37–60 days when mists occur during the cold period, and 3–5 days when thunderstorms with hail occur.

=== Ecology and climate change ===
On 28 January 2022, Vinnytsia City Council announced Vinnytsia Green Deal by signing the Declaration and approving the Roadmap of measures for the implementation of its principles and approaches within the community.

==History==

===Early history===
Vinnytsia has been an important trade and political center since the fourteenth century, when Fyodor Koriatovych, the nephew of the Lithuanian Duke Algirdas, built a fortress (1363) against Tatar raiders on the banks of the Southern Bug. The original settlement was built and populated by Aleksander Hrehorovicz Jelec, a hetman under Lithuanian Prince Švitrigaila. Aleksander Jelec built the fort, which he commanded as starosta afterwards.

In the 15th century, Lithuanian Grand Duke Alexander Jagiellon granted Vinnytsia Magdeburg city rights. In 1566, it became part of the Bracław Voivodeship. Between 1569 and 1793 the town was a part of Poland. In 1648, Vinnytsia found itself at the epicenter of the Cossack uprisings led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky. In February 1651, during the defense of the city, Ivan Bohun&#x27;s Cossack regiment defeated a 20,000-strong Polish army. Vinnytsia was part of the Hetman state until 1667, and during 1672-1699 was a part of the Ottoman Empire (and still part of the historic region of Podolia). During Polish rule, Vinnytsia was a Polish royal city. On 18 March 1783, Antoni Protazy Potocki opened the Polish Trade Company in Vinnytsia. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the Polish Crown Army was stationed in the city in 1788 before it was relocated to Piotrków Trybunalski.

===Late modern period===
After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 the Russian Empire annexed the city and the region. Russia moved to expunge the Roman Catholic religion. Catholic churches in the city, including what is currently the Transfiguration Cathedral, were converted to Russian Orthodox churches.
In the Russian census of 1897, Vinnytsia had a population of 30,563. It was the third largest city in Podolia region after Kamianets-Podilskyi and Uman. After railway connections were completed in 1871, Vinnytsia developed rapidly economically and infrastructurally. The city architect Hryhorii Artynov erected a number of buildings (a water tower, a theater, churches, hotels and mansions), which still shape the city image.

During the Ukrainian Revolution of 1917-1920, Vinnytsia was chosen three times as the seat of government structures of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. The residence of the Directory was Savoy Hotel, which turned the city into a de facto capital. On 16 May 1920, a meeting was held in Vinnytsia between the heads of Ukraine and Poland, Symon Petliura and Józef Piłsudski.

Soviet Vinnytsia became an industrial giant with an emphasis on sugar production, but in the shadow of its prosperity it experienced a devastating man-made famine occurred in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933.

The Vinnytsia massacre was the mass execution of between 9,000 and 11,000 people in Vinnytsia by the Soviet secret police NKVD during the Great Purge in 1937–1938.

===World War II===
Vinnytsia was occupied by German troops on 19 July 1941 during World War II. While Vinnytsia had a pre-war Jewish population of over 34,000, only 17,000 of these Jews remained, with the rest of them successfully being evacuated to the interior of the Soviet Union beforehand. Virtually all of the Jews who remained in Vinnytsia under Nazi occupation were subsequently murdered in the Holocaust.
Nazi atrocities were committed in and near Vinnytsia by Einsatzgruppe C. 
In 1942 a large part of the Jewish quarter of Yerusalimka was destroyed by Germans. Related to that period is one infamous photo, &quot;The Last Jew of Vinnytsia&quot;.

Adolf Hitler sited his eastern headquarters, &quot;Führerhauptquartier Werwolf&quot; or &quot;Wehrwolf&quot;, at the Wehrmacht headquarters near the city.

<text>Pandora (1998) is a vampire novel by American writer Anne Rice. It is one of two novels in the &quot;New Tales of the Vampires&quot; series, along with &quot;Vittorio the Vampire&quot;.

==Plot summary== 
Pandora was born with the name Lydia in the Roman Republic in the year 15 BC to a Senatorial family. She is tall, with rippling brown hair and gold-brown eyes. Like many Patrician Roman girls of the time Pandora was taught how to read and write and is well versed in epic poems, especially Ovid&#x27;s works. She meets Marius for the first time when he is twenty-five and she is ten. Marius asks for Lydia&#x27;s hand in marriage, but her father rejects Marius&#x27; offer. Five years later, Lydia sees Marius at a festival and begs her father to allow her to marry Marius. Her father again refuses.

Pandora&#x27;s father holds a high rank as a Senator. But when a new emperor takes power, her family is betrayed by her own brother and killed. Only Pandora and her traitorous brother survive the massacre, and she is taken to Antioch (after changing her name) by a man who was very close to her father. There she meets Marius again, twenty years after their last encounter. Unbeknownst to her, Marius is now a vampire.

She eventually finds out what Marius has become, and also that he protects and hides the Queen and King of all Vampires. Another vampire, Akabar, wants to steal the Queen&#x27;s powerful and ancient blood. Marius and Pandora try to prevent him from carrying out his plan. To gain access to the Queen, Akabar uses Marius&#x27;s love for Pandora against him and drains Pandora to the point of death. In order to save her, Marius is forced to make Pandora into a vampire and forced to let Akabar see the Queen, who then destroys Akabar. The pair stay together for the next two hundred years, taking care of the King and Queen of all vampires, before arguing and separating. Marius later characterized the breakup (of which he left her and she spent six months or more waiting for him to return) as being entirely his fault: He considers himself a teacher who longs to impart what he knows upon his pupils, but Pandora—being as free-spirited and highly educated as she was—had no patience to be his student. During their time together, against his objection, she did turn one of her beloved slaves into a vampire. As soon as he was turned he left the pair and was not seen again.

The next time they meet again is in a Dresden ballroom in the early to late-17th century. Marius tries in vain to make Pandora leave her companion and fledgling, Arjun, and come back to him. Pandora&#x27;s relationship with Arjun is of great concern to Marius, who fears Pandora is being held against her will. While she outwardly denies this, Pandora overcomes her embarrassment and admits to David in her writing that she could not bring herself to leave Arjun, citing that his stronger will propelled them both through time.

The next and last time that they meet is in 1985, when she is among thirteen vampires who survived Akasha&#x27;s killing spree and gathered at Maharet&#x27;s house in the Sonoma compound to battle against Akasha. Pandora remains quiet and withdrawn throughout the whole ordeal, staring out the windows and saying little, rousing herself only once to say that Akasha is trying to justify deplorable &quot;reasons&quot; for a holocaust.

Like many vampires, Pandora is a morose, despairing immortal who initially wanted immortality but soon regretted her choice and turns into a dark, indifferent cynic. Lestat thinks that Pandora was troubled in some deep, fundamental way even before she became a vampire, because she&#x27;s the only vampire who does not receive visions of Maharet and Mekare in her dreams. During the confrontation in Sonoma, when Akasha directly asks Pandora to join with her or die, Pandora merely responds in a quiet, indifferent voice that she cannot do what Akasha is asking of her, and stoically accepts the idea of being killed.

Even after Akasha herself is destroyed and the thirteen vampires regroup in Armand&#x27;s Night Island in Florida, Pandora still acts withdrawn from her fellow vampire kin, watching music videos all day long and completely ignoring Marius, who dotes on her lovingly. There is no sense of recovery or security in her as there is with the other vampires, and she departs from Night Island alone, still just as morose as ever.

==Other novels==
David Talbot encounters her in Paris shortly after the events of &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; and before the story of &quot;The Vampire Armand&quot;. He asks her to write the story of her life, which she does in a cafe by writing in some notebooks he gave her. She recalls the details of her life before becoming a vampire and briefly discusses the period when she was with Marius. After she has finished, she writes that she plans to go to New Orleans to look for Marius and to look into the eyes of Lestat, and try to understand what it is he saw. She is last seen at the end of &quot;Blood and Gold&quot;, alongside Marius.

Pandora is again seen in the novel &quot;Prince Lestat&quot; when she comes to confront Arjun of his burning fledglings and old ones in Mumbai after being told by &quot;The Voice&quot;. There she meets Gremt Stryker Knollys, who confides in her that he is also searching for &quot;The Voice&quot;. He also claims to be the founder of the Talamasca in the year 748, along with the vampire who created Marius and the ghost of a vampire that was just killed named Hesketh. Gremt is the spirit Pandora meets towards the end of her novel when the writer Cassiodorus dies.

<text>Cahal Pech is a Maya site located near the town of San Ignacio in the Cayo District of Belize. The site was a palatial, hilltop home for an elite Maya family, and though the most major construction dates to the Classic period, evidence of continuous habitation has been dated to as far back as 1200 BCE during the Early Middle Formative period (Early Middle Preclassic), making Cahal Pech one of the oldest recognizably Maya sites in Western Belize.

==Location==
The site rests high above the banks of the Macal River and is strategically located to overlook the confluence of the Macal River and the Mopan River. The site is a collection of 34 structures, with the tallest temple being about 25 meters in height, situated around a central acropolis. The site was abandoned in the 9th century CE for unknown reasons.

==Archaeology==
The earliest pottery in western Belize is found here.
&quot;Emerging information from western Belize suggests that ceramic-using populations may have been in place as early as ca. 1200 B.C. at Cahal Pech and perhaps elsewhere (Awe 1992; Clark and Cheetham 2002; Garber et al. 2004; Healy and Awe 1995). While these complexes, termed &quot;Cunil&quot; at Cahal Pech and &quot;Kanocha&quot; at Blackman Eddy, remain to be broadly documented across the Belize River Valley, they are the earliest established ceramic technologies recorded in western Belize.&quot;
The name &quot;Cahal Pech&quot;, meaning &quot;Place of the Ticks&quot; in the Yucatec Maya language, was given when the area was used as pasture during the first archaeological studies in the 1950s, led by Linton Satterthwaite from the University of Pennsylvania Museum. It is now an archaeological reserve, and houses a small museum with artifacts from various ongoing excavations.

The primary excavation of the site began in 1988. Restoration was completed in 2000 under the leadership of Dr. Jaime Awe, Director of the National Institute of Archaeology (NICH), Belize.

Other nearby Maya sites include Chaa Creek, Xunantunich, Baking Pot, and Lower Dover.

<doc id="1214002" wikidata="Q16266534" url="?curid=1214002" title="Catan (2007 video game)">
<text>Catan was the Xbox Live Arcade version of Klaus Teuber&#x27;s &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;, developed by Big Huge Games in collaboration with Teuber. It was released on May 2, 2007. It is the first German-style board game to be released on Xbox Live Arcade, which was followed by &quot;Carcassonne&quot;.

The game has since been removed from Xbox Live Arcade and is no longer available to purchase.

== Development ==
During an interview with Big Huge Games founder Brian Reynolds, it was revealed that Microsoft approached Big Huge Games with the idea for the project. As part of the same interview, Klaus Teuber&#x27;s collaboration on the project was explained, noting that he was instrumental in helping Reynolds create the AI, using notes and statistics he had generated years ago but had never previously been able to apply.

Reynolds later stated, regarding the board game, &quot;The design is so elegant you can teach someone to play in minutes and then spend years trying to master it. With our expertise in interface design and artificial intelligence, it seemed like a natural fit for the project!&quot;

Teuber has fully endorsed the Big Huge Games version, claiming that the game has exceeded his expectations and noting that he himself has lost several games in a row to the AI. The rules of the computerized version are faithful to the original, with one exception suggested by Teuber himself; the number of resource cards held by players is not limited to the number of resource cards which came with the board game. This was the original design intent, but one which couldn&#x27;t be implemented due to the necessity to include only a finite number of physical cards in game boxes.

== Features ==

As with the traditional board game, &quot;Catan&quot; uses a game board composed of 19 randomly arranged hexagonal tiles, each representing a different type of terrain or resource. Through strategy, luck, and skillful negotiation, 3 or 4 players vie to be the first to earn 10 victory points. This is done through building and enlarging settlements, by establishing the largest army, by building the longest road, or through the use of certain &quot;development cards&quot;.

&quot;Catan&quot; claims to have the best &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; artificial intelligence to date, featuring thirteen unique AI personalities for single player play and multiplayer games with fewer than four humans. Each AI personality, portrayed by a likeness of a famous leader or general (e.g. Abraham Lincoln, Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, etc.), has attributes such as their preferred strategy for winning, how quickly they like to expand, and their favorite resource. Three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) control the level of expertise displayed by these opponents.

The game features two different &quot;skins&quot; for the game board. The first is a traditional flat view of the board, while the second is a &quot;living world&quot;, showing the board as a 3D environment. The board can be rotated during gameplay to provide the desired view, and users can also tweak other visual options such as player colors (for those who are color blind).

As is typical of Xbox Live Arcade games, the game features online play and leaderboards. Separate leaderboards are used to display single player and multiplayer rankings. Unlike many games which keep the TrueSkill level of the players hidden, &quot;Catan&quot; displays the calculated current values on one of the leaderboards.

Gameplay is turn-based, but turn timers are used to prevent individual players from halting the progression of the game. While not accessible in ranked matches, custom matches can make use of user-defined &quot;House Rules&quot;. Items which can be tweaked include the turn timer, how resource production works, rules for the thief/robber, and several others.

In all types of matches, players can use graphical &quot;ticklers&quot; (or &quot;emotes&quot;) to communicate thoughts or feelings, including love or hatred of the dice and/or other players. Similar devices, referred to as &quot;Fooms&quot;, were previously available in the Hardwood series of Xbox Live Arcade games. These can be used as an alternative to voice chat (which is supported but not required) in order to, for example, encourage opponents to &quot;sweeten a deal&quot; or warn that they are too close to winning. The ticklers are used by AI players to indicate their &quot;mood&quot; in response to a player&#x27;s actions; pleasing AIs will influence them to treat the player as an ally (though not to the point of jeopardizing their position), while angering them will serve to focus their negative attention. AI players will react to player-directed emotes towards them as well.

== Downloadable content ==
Less than a week after the title&#x27;s release, a separate theme pack (&quot;Themes Pack 1&quot;) and picture pack (&quot;Generals Picture Pack 1&quot;) were made available for download.

On May 31, 2007 a &quot;Mayfair&quot; skin pack (to change the visual representation of the game to the United States version of the board game) was available, as well another gamertag picture pack (&quot;Generals Picture Pack 2&quot;).

On June 13, 2007, a &quot;Generals&quot; AI expansion pack was released which added additional computer-controlled opponents, including Joan of Arc, Hannibal, and Tokugawa.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; gave it a favorable review while it was still in development.

Reviews of the game have generally found it to be a solid adaptation of the classic board game, but noting that it inherently limited the game&#x27;s audience. While those who enjoy slower-paced strategy games will likely find the title a good value, the pace won&#x27;t appeal to players who demand more action. The user interface has been well received, with the trading interface receiving wide praise, although reviews note several negatives as well, including the title&#x27;s lack of support for the Xbox Live Vision camera and the absence of a local multiplayer option. Additionally, the game uses a relatively small text font which may be hard to read on smaller televisions, although the developers have stated that the game uses separate fonts for high-definition and standard-definition displays.

Contrary to published critical reviews, however, customer reaction had been strongly positive, with the game debuting third in sales in its first week of availability.

<doc id="1214010" wikidata="Q7487945" url="?curid=1214010" title="Shands Bridge">
<text>The Shands Bridge is a two-lane automobile bridge carrying SR 16 over the St. Johns River south of Jacksonville, Florida.

==History==
The first structure at the site was a 2-mile-long wooden toll span with a draw bridge inaugurated in 1928. It was located just north of the current span, crossing from Orangedale to the present Shands pier on the west side of the river. The current bridge was dedicated on October 30, 1963, and features concrete beam-type construction for a total of two lanes. Until the building of the I-295 Buckman Bridge it was the only crossing of the St. Johns River between Jacksonville and Palatka.

In 2004, proposals were made to replace or upgrade the span. Problems cited include increasing traffic in the Clay County and St. Johns County areas, safety, and the inability of large boats to travel upriver. One plan proposed a new bridge north of the existing one, connecting to extensions of SR 9B and SR 23. Eventually a planned span just to the south was selected. In the fall of 2005, the railings of the bridge were upgraded to solid concrete barriers in an effort to reduce over-bridge fatalities.

On October 7, 2016, the eastern approach to the bridge was eroded by Hurricane Matthew, and the bridge was closed. However, the bridge reopened on October 9, 2016.

==First Coast Expressway Replacement==
The third and final segment of the First Coast Expressway (also known as SR 23, which will connect I-10 and I-95 as a partial outer beltway around Jacksonville and Orange Park) includes a new four-lane bridge over the St. Johns River just south of where the Shands Bridge currently stands, as well as construction of new roadway connecting to I-95 in St. Johns County. Right-of-way acquisition, design and permitting for this $763 million segment is expected to be completed in 2020, with construction beginning in 2023 and ending in 2030. The current bridge will be partially or fully removed. The vertical clearance height of the new bridge will be 65 feet from the water line, compared to the existing 45 feet of clearance. The additional 20 feet will match the clearance of the Buckman Bridge to the north and Palatka&#x27;s Memorial Bridge to the south and is an improvement for marine commerce in the region. In addition to the four lanes of traffic, the new bridge will also include street lighting, full breakdown lanes on both sides of the roadway in each direction, as well as a 12-foot wide shared-use path with several scenic overlooks, compared to the current bridge which has no street lighting or pedestrian path and only one lane of traffic in each direction surrounded by narrow shoulders.

<doc id="1214012" wikidata="Q50902" url="?curid=1214012" title="WrestleMania XIX">
<text>WrestleMania XIX was the 19th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It featured wrestlers from the promotion&#x27;s Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place at Safeco Field in Seattle on March 30, 2003, becoming the first WrestleMania held in the state of Washington. A record-breaking 54,097 fans from all 50 states and numerous countries around the world at Safeco Field resulted in ticket earnings of $2.76 million.
WrestleMania XIX was the first WrestleMania to be promoted under the WWE name after the promotion was renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in May 2002. It was also the first WrestleMania to take place after WWE introduced the brand extension in March 2002. The official theme song for the event was &quot;Crack Addict&quot; by Limp Bizkit, who appeared at the event to perform the song; the band also performed their song &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; during The Undertaker&#x27;s entrance.

The marquee match from the SmackDown! brand, which was the main event, saw Brock Lesnar win the WWE Championship from defending champion Kurt Angle. The marquee match from the Raw brand was the third and final WrestleMania bout between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin (after 15 and X-Seven), which The Rock won, marking Austin&#x27;s final match before his retirement from in-ring performance due to injuries sustained in previous years (Austin would return for a one-off main event against Kevin Owens 19 years later at WrestleMania 38). 

The other primary match from the Raw brand saw Triple H retain the World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T, while other matches on the undercard included Shawn Michaels defeating Chris Jericho in his first WrestleMania since WrestleMania XIV in 1998, Hulk Hogan defeating Mr. McMahon in a street fight billed &quot;20 Years in the Making&quot;, and The Undertaker defeating the team of Big Show and A-Train in a handicap match.

== Production ==
=== Background ===

WrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs, along with King of the Ring until its discontinuation after 2002. WrestleMania XIX was held on March 30, 2003, at Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington. It was the first, and to date, only WrestleMania held in the state of Washington.

WrestleMania XIX was the first WrestleMania promoted under the WWE name, following the company being renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May 2002 following a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initials. It was also the first WrestleMania to be held under the company&#x27;s first brand extension that began in March 2002, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform on their respective shows; WrestleMania XIX featured wrestlers from both brands. It was also the first WrestleMania to feature the World Heavyweight Championship that was introduced for Raw in September 2002 after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown! and was renamed to the WWE Championship.

A documentary entitled &quot;The Mania of WrestleMania&quot; was filmed live during the event and released the following year. It was the first sole production from WWE Films. WrestleMania XIX also marked the first time that production equipment was suspended from the underside of Safeco Field&#x27;s roof (while in the closed position) with WWE suspending their lighting truss system from it.

=== Storylines ===
The main feud heading into WrestleMania on the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar, with the two feuding over the WWE Championship. Angle won the title three months prior at Armageddon by defeating then-champion Big Show with Lesnar&#x27;s help; Lesnar had lost the title at Survivor Series in November 2002 after his agent, Paul Heyman, betrayed him and assisted Big Show in winning the match. On the episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; immediately following Armageddon, Angle revealed that he too had taken on Heyman as his agent, and together they would ensure Lesnar never received an opportunity to regain the WWE Championship. Lesnar responded by brutally attacking Angle at the end of the show, injuring Angle&#x27;s knee.

At the Royal Rumble, Angle faced Chris Benoit for his championship while Lesnar was forced to wrestle Big Show for a spot in the Royal Rumble match, which guaranteed the winner a shot at his brand&#x27;s championship at WrestleMania. Angle defeated Benoit by submission to retain his title. Lesnar defeated Big Show, despite interference from Heyman, to win his way into the Royal Rumble, which he entered at number 29 and won after last eliminating The Undertaker. The following month at No Way Out, Lesnar and Benoit defeated Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Shelton Benjamin, and Charlie Haas) in a handicap match. During No Way Out, Edge was supposed to team up with Lesnar and Benoit to wrestle Team Angle in the scheduled Six Man Tag team match but Edge was attacked backstage and it was announced he could not participate in the match. In reality, Edge had suffered a severe neck injury prior to the event, and needed time off for surgery. On the March 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Lesnar defeated Heyman in a steel cage match to earn a WWE Championship match against Angle. On the March 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Angle defeated Lesnar to retain the WWE Championship. Before the match began, Kurt, who was &quot;praying&quot; in the corner, switched places with his brother Eric. Lesnar then came out and the match began. Shortly after the match began, Benjamin and Haas came to the ring and distracted Lesnar, which gave Eric time to switch back with Kurt. As Lesnar regained his focus, Kurt was able to pin him with a small package for the win. The following week on the March 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon told Angle that, at WrestleMania, if he tried to get himself disqualified, counted out or if Benjamin, Haas, Heyman, Eric or anyone tried to interfere in their match on Angle&#x27;s behalf, he would lose the title.

The main feud on the Raw brand was between The Rock and Steve Austin. On the February 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Rock returned to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (his last appearance being at SummerSlam the previous August). On that evening, he was involved in a confrontation with Hulk Hogan before their WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out, officially turning heel in the process. At No Way Out, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of Mr. McMahon. On the February 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock moved to the Raw brand and competed in a 20-man Battle royal that would determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. The Rock however, lost after he was eliminated by Booker T. The Rock would go on to criticize Austin for being chosen as the &quot;Superstar of the Decade&quot; by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between them. On the March 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin, who had left the company during the summer of 2002 before returning at No Way Out, made his WWE television return. As he cut a promo about the WWE fans, he was interrupted by The Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because Rock was obsessed with not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event, since The Rock had lost their two previous encounters at WrestleMania XV and X-Seven, respectively. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced that the following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or challenge Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. On the March 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock, with Bischoff&#x27;s approval, announced that he would pick his own opponent for later that night, which turned out to be The Hurricane, in hopes for The Rock to gain an easy victory. However, during the match, Austin made his way down the entrance ramp, which distracted The Rock and allowed The Hurricane to roll up The Rock into a successful pinfall, thus making the match between Austin and The Rock at WrestleMania official. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin was banned from entering the arena, as The Rock proceeded to perform the first ever &quot;Rock Concert&quot; that night. However, he managed to enter the arena and attack The Rock during the segment before The Rock fled the ring.
The secondary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Hulk Hogan and Mr. McMahon. One month prior at No Way Out, during a match between Hogan and The Rock, McMahon came down to the ring, only to distract Hogan, which allowed the referee, Sylvan Grenier, to give The Rock a chair, which The Rock used to hit Hogan and pin him for the win. After No Way Out, McMahon proclaimed that Hulkamania was dead and proclaiming a new &#x27;mania; &quot;McMahonamania&quot;. On the March 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Hogan informed McMahon that Hulkamania was not dead and that McMahon had nothing to do with creating it. McMahon informed Hogan that he did not hate Hulkamaniacs or Hulkamania, but he hated Hogan. He then told Hogan that he hated him for leaving WWE (then known as the WWF) and signing with Ted Turner&#x27;s World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and for testifying against him in the infamous steroid trial in the 1990s. McMahon proceeded to challenge Hogan to a Street Fight at WrestleMania where if Hogan lost, he would have to retire from professional wrestling. Hogan accepted his challenge later that night. Two weeks later on the March 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, McMahon and Hogan had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania. As Hogan was preparing to sign the contract, McMahon attacked Hogan with a steel chair from behind. Shortly afterward, McMahon hit Hogan several times with the chair in the head, causing him to bleed. McMahon then signed the contract and forced Hogan to sign with his blood.

Another feud on the Raw brand was between Triple H and Booker T, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H won the title three months prior at Armageddon by defeating then-champion Shawn Michaels in a 3 Stages of Hell match. In the months following, Triple H wrestled Scott Steiner during the following two pay-per-view events for the World Heavyweight Championship. First was at the Royal Rumble, where Triple H got himself disqualified in order to retain the title when he nailed Steiner with the sledgehammer. Then at No Way Out, he defeated Steiner by pinfall to retain the title. On the February 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Booker T won a 20-man battle royal by last eliminating The Rock to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. On the March 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Triple H cut a somewhat controversial promo on Booker T. Triple H downplayed Booker T&#x27;s WCW success, pointing out that the WCW World Heavyweight Championship had been held by non-wrestlers like Vince Russo and actor David Arquette calling WCW and its title &quot;a joke&quot;. He implied that Booker T, as a convicted criminal, would never win a world championship in WWE, telling Booker T that &quot;people like him&quot; could never be World Heavyweight Champion. In the WrestleMania XIX press conference, Michael Cole questioned Triple H as to whether or not his promo was racially insensitive. Triple H confirmed this was not the case and was indeed only referring to Booker T&#x27;s criminal past and nothing more. On the March 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Booker T got revenge by attacking Triple H in the bathroom, laying him out. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Booker T and Goldust defeated Triple H and Ric Flair in a tag team match with Booker T pinning Triple H.

Another feud from the Raw brand was the rivalry over the Women&#x27;s Championship. The champion Victoria had captured the title from Trish Stratus at Survivor Series. The next month at Armageddon, Victoria defeated Stratus and Jacqueline in a triple threat match to retain the Women&#x27;s Championship. Stratus and the returning Jazz had a match on &quot;Raw&quot; to determine who would challenge Victoria for the title at WrestleMania. During the match, Victoria entered the ring and hit both women with the title belt, earning a double disqualification. It was then announced that Victoria would defend the title against both Stratus and Jazz in a triple threat match at the event.

A smaller feud, also from the Raw brand was between Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels. After Michaels lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Armageddon, he appeared in an in-ring segment with Jericho, during which Jericho stated that Michaels was washed up. After mocking Michaels and threatening to attack him, Jericho turned around into a superkick. When Michaels was a guest on Jericho&#x27;s in-ring show &quot;The Highlight Reel&quot; the following month, Jericho claimed he had idolized Michaels from a young age and that he had been Jericho&#x27;s inspiration to become a wrestler, even going so far as to emulate Michaels in his early professional years. At the Royal Rumble, Michaels and Jericho entered the Royal Rumble match at #1 and #2, respectively. Jericho eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match, after a sneak attack from behind. Michaels returned later in the match and attacked Jericho out of revenge, helping to lead to his elimination. The two agreed to meet at WrestleMania XIX in a match.

== Event ==
===Sunday Night Heat===
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Kane and Rob Van Dam faced Chief Morley and Lance Storm (with The Dudley Boyz, (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley)) for the World Tag Team Championship on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;. At the end, while the referee was distracted, the Dudleyz performed the 3D (Dudley Death Drop) on Storm. After which, Bubba dropped an elbow on Van Dam, allowing Storm to pin Van Dam, thus Storm and Morley retained the titles.

===Preliminary matches===

As the event began, Ashanti sang a rendition of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, which was omitted from DVD and WWE Network releases.

In the first match that aired, Rey Mysterio faced Matt Hardy for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. The match began with back and forth action between the two, until Hardy performed a &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; for a near-fall. Mysterio retaliated by delivering a &quot;619&quot; on Hardy, but as Mysterio delivered a West Coast Pop, Hardy ducked into a roll-up that saw Hardy use the ring ropes for leverage and successfully pinned Mysterio, thus Hardy retained the Cruiserweight Championship.
In the next match, The Undertaker and Nathan Jones faced Big Show and A-Train in a tag team match. Earlier in the night on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, Jones was attacked and beaten down by the FBI. It was then announced that The Undertaker would have to face both Big Show and A-Train in a handicap match. Both Big Show and A-Train had the advantage of The Undertaker at the start of the match; however, late into the match, Jones appeared and attacked Big Show, allowing The Undertaker to deliver a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; on A-Train for a successful pinfall, thus The Undertaker won the match and remained undefeated at WrestleMania.

In the third match, Victoria, Jazz and Trish Stratus fought in a triple threat match for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. Throughout the match, Jazz and Victoria would double-team Stratus and Steven Richards, who was at ringside in Victoria&#x27;s corner, would intervene in the match. As Jazz was thrown over the top rope onto ringside, however, Richards came in the ring with a steel chair and tried to hit Stratus with it but missed and hit it off the ropes into his face, allowing Stratus to perform the Stratus Faction on him. Victoria went for the &quot;Widow&#x27;s Peak&quot; on Stratus, who countered with a Chick Kick to Victoria to win the match and the women&#x27;s title, tying The Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s record of four title reigns.

The next match was a triple threat WWE Tag Team Championship match between the teams of Rhyno and Chris Benoit, Los Guerreros (Chavo and Eddie Guerrero), and the champions, Team Angle (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas). Rhyno delivered a &quot;Gore&quot; on Chavo but Benjamin tagged himself into the match and pinned Chavo, to win the match and retain the Tag Team Championship.
In the fifth match, Chris Jericho faced Shawn Michaels. Jericho had the advantage over Michaels at the start of the match, as he applied the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; onto Michaels early on. Later in the match, Jericho hit Michaels with a Sweet Chin Music for a near fall and as Michaels attempted &quot;Sweet Chin Music&quot;, Jericho countered into the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot;. After Michaels escaped the hold, he hit Jericho with a Sweet Chin Music for a near fall. Later, Jericho attempted a suplex that Michaels countered into a roll-up giving him the successful pinfall victory. After the match, Jericho offered to shake Michaels&#x27;s hand and they hugged before Jericho attacked Michaels with a low blow.

Before the next match begun, a fatal four-way pillow fight (hosted by Jonathan Coachman) took place between Stacy Keibler, Torrie Wilson, Tanya Ballinger, and Kitana Baker. The match went to a no contest when all four women teamed up, pulling down Coachman&#x27;s pants and pinning him.

=== Main event matches ===
The next match was a World Heavyweight Championship match between Booker T and Triple H. The match began with Booker T in control of Triple H, however, Ric Flair, who was at ringside in Triple H&#x27;s corner, threw Booker T&#x27;s knee into the steel steps. The attack allowed Triple H to work over Booker T&#x27;s leg, as he applied various submission holds onto Booker T&#x27;s leg including the Indian deathlock. Booker T retaliated and took control of the match; after he delivered a Harlem Hangover leg drop, Booker T grasped his knee in pain, which allowed Triple H to recover and perform a &quot;Pedigree&quot; to win the match and retain the World Heavyweight Championship.

The seventh match was a Street fight between Hulk Hogan and the WWE Chairman, Mr. McMahon. Both Hogan and McMahon tested each other&#x27;s strength in the beginning of the match, until McMahon threw Hogan at ringside. Hogan then countered a chairshot by McMahon into several of his own, that caused McMahon to bleed profusely from the head. Late into the match, Roddy Piper made a shocking appearance as he interfered in the match and hit Hogan with a pipe. Hogan however, recovered and delivered a big boot and three running leg drops to McMahon to successfully pin him and win the match.
The next and final match on the undercard, was the encounter of The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The match began with Austin and The Rock brawling in the ring, which ended up at ringside. Throughout the match, The Rock worked over Austin&#x27;s leg, which included applying a Sharpshooter on Austin. The Rock then began to constantly taunt Austin, as he put on his vest and imitated his taunts and mannerisms, which led both to use their finishers with unsuccessful pin attempts. Austin performed the Stone Cold Stunner on The Rock for a near-fall, much to Austin&#x27;s dismay. After he failed to win with the People&#x27;s Elbow, The Rock then performed two Rock Bottoms on Austin for two near-falls. The Rock performed a third Rock Bottom on Austin, winning the match. After the match in the ring Rock privately thanked Austin for helping him in his career. This was Austin&#x27;s last match until WrestleMania 38 in 2022.
In the main event, Brock Lesnar faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship, where if Kurt Angle was disqualified or counted out, he would lose the title. The match began with Lesnar and Angle chain-wrestling back and forth, until Angle countered a shoulder block into a German suplex. Lesnar would then attempt an &quot;F-5&quot; on Angle but Angle countered it into an &quot;Ankle Lock&quot; that Lesnar was able to escape out of. As Lesnar escaped, Angle would hit an Angle Slam for a near fall. As he attempted another &quot;Angle Slam&quot;, however, Lesnar countered into an &quot;F-5&quot; for a near-fall. Lesnar performed another &quot;F-5,&quot; and instead of covering Angle, Lesnar climbed to the top rope and massively botched a &quot;Shooting Star Press&quot; on Angle, which Angle covered for by pinning Lesnar for a near-fall. After Lesnar kicked out, Angle picked up Lesnar only to be hit with a third &quot;F-5&quot;, Lesnar then successfully pinned Angle, winning the match and the WWE Championship. After the match, Angle and Lesnar shook hands and embraced as the show came to a close.

== Reception ==
The event received highly positive reviews from various websites and wrestling publications. John Powell of Canadian Online Explorer&#x27;s professional wrestling section rated the event a perfect score of 10 out of 10 stars, which was a higher rating than the previous year&#x27;s event. The main event between Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship was rated the highest with a score of 9 out of 10 stars, the match between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin was rated 8 out of 10 stars, the match between Booker T and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship was rated 7.5 out of 10 stars (although the finish was generally frowned upon), the match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho was also rated 7.5 out of 10 stars and the Street Fight between Vince McMahon and Hulk Hogan receiving the lowest rating of 4 out of 10 stars. He also noted that &quot;it was the WWE slugging homeruns last night at WrestleMania XIX. Criticized for not making the most of the talent it has, the WWE had all the bases covered and proved that if the entire organization puts forth the effort, they can deliver a superior sports entertainment product&quot; and further claimed that &quot;WrestleMania XIX was not only a outstanding show but it will surely go down as one of the best WrestleManias ever&quot;. In 2019, Troy L. Smith of &quot;cleveland.com&quot; released a list of the &quot;50 Greatest Wrestling Pay-Per-Views of All Time&quot; from every professional wrestling promotion in the world, with WrestleMania XIX ranked at number eight.

Most of the critics rated Jericho vs. Michaels as the match of the night. Kazuchika Okada stated that he &quot;learned so much from that match.&quot; Jericho reported that Michaels viewed it as the best match of the night and a &quot;five-star match&quot;. Jericho himself called it &quot;one of the best matches in Mania history.&quot;

== Aftermath ==
On the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after WrestleMania, SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon announced Kurt Angle suffered a pulled hamstring and a neck injury, while Lesnar suffered multiple concussions. She later announced that a tournament would take place to determine the number one contender to Lesnar&#x27;s WWE Championship at Backlash. On the April 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, John Cena would become the number one contender after he defeated Chris Benoit in the tournament&#x27;s final match. At Backlash, Lesnar defeated Cena to retain the WWE Championship. Lesnar would then feud with Big Show, as he defeated him at Judgment Day to retain the WWE Championship in a stretcher match. Lesnar would, however, lose the WWE Championship to Angle at Vengeance in a triple threat match that also involved Big Show. Lesnar then regained the WWE Championship from Angle on the September 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, in an Iron Man match winning 5-4.

On the April 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, enraged by his loss at WrestleMania, Mr. McMahon indefinitely suspended Hulk Hogan with pay and forced him to sit out the remainder of his WWE contract as a part of their storyline. On the May 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, &quot;Mr. America&quot; (Hogan under a mask) made his debut on &quot;Piper&#x27;s Pit&quot;, where McMahon promised to prove Mr. America was actually Hogan. Also involved in the feud was Zach Gowen, a one legged wrestler who was brought into the feud by Mr. America. After multiple failed attempts to prove Mr. America was Hogan, however, McMahon finally succeeded on the July 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after he aired footage of Mr. America unmasking and revealing himself to be Hogan. He then announced that Hogan was fired from WWE.

On the &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania, Stone Cold Steve Austin was fired from the WWE in storyline by Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff due to &quot;medical reasons&quot;. Austin was later re-hired a few weeks later by WWE CEO, Linda McMahon, however, as Raw&#x27;s Co-General Manager, along with Bischoff. Later that night, The Rock hosted &quot;Rock Appreciation Night&quot;, where he taunted Austin for getting fired and proclaimed he was leaving WWE, as he had nothing left to accomplish, and because the fans did not appreciate him anymore. Goldberg would officially make his WWE debut by interrupting The Rock, telling him &quot;You&#x27;re Next!&quot;, which led to Goldberg spearing The Rock. On the April 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock would accept the challenge made by Goldberg, which he had previously rejected a week earlier, meaning the two would wrestle each other at Backlash. At Backlash, Goldberg successfully pinned The Rock. After the match, once the show was off the air, The Rock gave a farewell speech in which he stated that he was officially taking a sabbatical from professional wrestling.

By 1875, a series of annexations to Detroit and Highland Park had begun; by 1926, the township of Greenfield had ceased to exist.

Today, Greenfield Road follows the former western township boundary between Greenfield and Redford Township. 8 Mile road was the northern boundary of Greenfield Township. Tireman Avenue follows the former southern boundary between Greenfield and Springwells Township.

== Settlements of the former Greenfield Township ==
*Cassandra
*Greenfield
*Howlett
*Sherwood
*Strathmoor
*Whitewood (later Highland Park)
*Yew

== Noteworthy ==
In 1863, American industrialist Henry Ford was born in southern Greenfield Township; Ford&#x27;s future wife, Clara Jane Bryant, was born four miles to the north, in 1866. The Bryant home stood at the intersection of Greenfield Road and Grand River Avenue.

<text>Ma mère l&#x27;Oye (English: &quot;Mother Goose&quot;, literally &quot;My Mother the Goose&quot;) is a suite by French composer Maurice Ravel. The piece was originally written as a five-movement piano duet in 1910. In 1911, Ravel orchestrated the work.

==Piano versions==
Ravel originally wrote &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; as a piano duet for the Godebski children, Mimi and Jean, ages 6 and 7. Ravel dedicated this work for four hands to the children (just as he had dedicated an earlier work, &quot;Sonatine&quot;, to their parents). Jeanne Leleu (age 11) and Geneviève Durony (age 14 (10 by another source)) premiered the work at the first concert of the Société musicale indépendante on 20 April 1910.

The piece was transcribed for solo piano by Ravel&#x27;s friend Jacques Charlot the same year as it was published (1910); the first movement of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Le tombeau de Couperin&quot; was dedicated to Charlot&#x27;s memory after his death in World War I.

Both piano versions bear the subtitle &quot;cinq pièces enfantines&quot; (five children&#x27;s pieces). The five pieces are:

# &quot;Pavane de la Belle au bois dormant&quot;: Lent (Pavane of Sleeping Beauty)
# &quot;Petit Poucet&quot;: Très modéré (Little Tom Thumb / Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb)
# &quot;Laideronnette, impératrice des pagodes&quot;: Mouvt de marche (Little Ugly Girl, Empress of the Pagodas)
# &quot;Les entretiens de la belle et de la bête&quot;: Mouvt de valse très modéré (Conversation of Beauty and the Beast)
# &quot;Le jardin féerique&quot;: Lent et grave (The Fairy Garden)

&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Little Tom Thumb&quot; are based on the tales of Charles Perrault, while &quot;Little Ugly Girl, Empress of the Pagodas&quot; is inspired by a tale (The Green Serpent) by Perrault&#x27;s &quot;rival&quot; Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy. &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is based upon the version by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont. The origin of &quot;The Fairy Garden&quot; is not entirely known, although the ballet version interprets this as Sleeping Beauty being awakened in the garden by her prince. 

On several of the scores, Ravel included quotes to indicate clearly what he is trying to invoke. For example, for the second piece, he writes:

==Orchestrated version==
In 1911, Ravel orchestrated the five-piece suite. This form is the most frequently heard today.

Later the same year, he also expanded it into a ballet, separating the five initial pieces with four new interludes and adding two movements at the start, &quot;Prélude&quot; and &quot;Danse du rouet et scène&quot;. The ballet premiered on 29 January 1912 at the Théâtre des Arts in Paris. The eleven numbers are:

==In popular culture==
* On his 1974 album, &quot;So What&quot;, American guitarist Joe Walsh recorded the first piano movement, which he simply titled &quot;Pavanne&quot;, on the synthesizer.
* On his 1980 album, &quot;Bolero&quot; (also titled &quot;The Ravel Album&quot;), Japanese synthesizer artist Isao Tomita recorded the five movements of the piano version.
* In the 1984 TV short &quot;Jean Shepherd on Route 1... and Other Major Thoroughfares&quot;, an orchestral version of &quot;Le jardin féerique&quot; plays in the background while Shepherd narrates a segment about U.S. Route 22.
* The 1993 album &quot;Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Enchanted Tales&quot; includes selections from the suite.
*In the 2007 anime &quot;Clannad&quot;, the characters choose &quot;Ma mére l&#x27;oye&quot; (more specifically a section of &quot;Petit Poucet: Très modéré&quot;) as the background music for their school play.
* The 2017 film &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot; makes extensive use of a section of &quot;Le jardin féerique&quot;,
* In the 2021 film &quot;The Worst Person in the World&quot;, a section of &quot;Les entretiens de la belle et de la bete&quot; plays while Julie freezes time to meet with Eivind at a cafe.
* The Korean Drama &quot;Sky Castle&quot; (2018-2019) employs Bolero and The Fairy Garden throughout the 20 episode saga.
* In Rick Owens&#x27; Fall/Winter 2024 women&#x27;s show &quot;Porterville&quot;, a looping synthesizer cover of the first movement was used throughout.

<text>Sylvester Sim (born 19 January 1983) is a Singaporean singer.

==Life and career==
Sim contested in the first &quot;Singapore Idol&quot; talent contest in 2004 was placed second place behind Taufik Batisah. He is also known as Sly. He used to be part of the J-rock band L&#x27;zefier.

=== Sim v Lim (scheduled muay thai fight) ===
On 31 July 2017, it was announced that Sim will be fighting prominent local celebrity Steven Lim in a muay thai &quot;celebrity bout&quot;. The fight was supposed to be held on 23 September 2017 at the inaugural Asia Fighting Championship event in Singapore.

However, one day before the actual fight, Sim reportedly dropped out of the fight due to &quot;insufficient insurance coverage provided by the organisers and restrictions on increased coverage as stipulated by the insurance companies.&quot; According to Sim&#x27;s management agency, &quot;this decision was made after careful considerations of the potential risks involved and ensuring Sylvester’s safety and well-being is of paramount importance.&quot; However, many locals believed that Sim pulled out as Lim, through a series of posts on social media, demonstrated that he was training for the fight seriously. As such, the fight, informally dubbed Sim-Lim in the Square (after local landmark Sim Lim Square), never took place. Lim later revealed Sim pulled out due to a lack of insurance coverage and was reported by &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, a local newspaper, that Sim had pulled out due to insurance coverage.

Sim was replaced by Pradip Subramanian, the President of the World Bodybuilding and Physique Sports Federation in Singapore. During the match, Subramanian took a &quot;few blows to the head&quot; and lost to Lim via a technical knockout. Subramanian lost consciousness shortly after and died from a cardiac arrest respiratory failure. It was reported that there were people who blamed Sim&#x27;s &quot;last-minute pull-out&quot;, suggesting that Sim&#x27;s action was a cause of Subramanian&#x27;s death, but &quot;there were many others who disagreed with this opinion&quot;. Lim was declared the winner.

==Personal life==
Sim married Sisy Wang, a dance choreographer from China, at Singapore Recreation Centre on 7 August 2012. They later had a daughter, Naomi Sim, who was born in 2016.

<doc id="1214030" wikidata="Q76757" url="?curid=1214030" title="Hagen Kleinert">
<text>Hagen Kleinert (born 15 June 1941) is professor of theoretical physics at the Free University of Berlin, Germany (since 1968),
Honorary Doctor at the
West University of Timișoara, and
at the
Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University
in Bishkek. He is also
Honorary Member of the
Russian Academy of Creative Endeavors. For his contributions to particle and solid-state physics he was awarded the Max Born Prize 2008 with Medal.
His contribution to the memorial volume celebrating the 100th birthday of Lev Davidovich Landau earned him the Majorana Prize 2008 with Medal. He is married to Dr. Annemarie Kleinert since 1974 with whom he has a son Michael Kleinert.

==Publications==
Kleinert has written ~420 papers on mathematical physics and the physics of elementary particles, nuclei, solid state systems, liquid crystals, biomembranes, microemulsions, polymers, and the theory of financial markets. He has written several books on theoretical physics, the most notable of which, &quot;Path Integrals in Quantum Mechanics, Statistics, Polymer Physics, and Financial Markets,&quot; has been published in five editions since 1990 and has received enthusiastic reviews.

==Education==
He studied physics at the Leibniz University Hannover between 1960 and 1963, and at several American universities including Georgia Institute of Technology, where he learned general relativity as a graduate student from George Gamow, one of the fathers of the Big Bang theory.
Kleinert earned his doctorate in 1967 at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

==Career==
As a young professor in 1972, Kleinert visited Caltech and was impressed by noted US physicist Richard Feynman. Later, Kleinert was to collaborate with Feynman in some of the latter&#x27;s last work.
This collaboration led to a mathematical method for converting divergent weak-coupling power series into strong-coupling ones. This so-called variational perturbation theory yields at present the most accurate theory of critical exponents
observable close to second-order phase transitions, as confirmed for superfluid helium in satellite experiments. He also discovered an alternative to Feynman&#x27;s time-sliced path integral construction which can be used to solve the path integral formulations of the hydrogen atom and the centrifugal barrier, i.e. to calculate their energy levels and eigenstates, as special cases of a general strategy for treating systems with singular potentials using path integrals.

Within the quantum field theories of quarks
he found the origin of the algebra of Regge residues conjectured by N. Cabibbo, L. Horwitz, and
Y. Ne&#x27;eman (see p. 232 in reference).

==Discoveries==
For superconductors he predicted in 1982 a tricritical point in the phase diagram between type-I and type-II superconductors where the order of the transition changes from second to first. The predictions were confirmed in 2002 by Monte Carlo computer simulations.

The theory is based on a disorder field theory dual to the order field theory of L.D. Landau for phase transitions which Kleinert developed in the books on &quot;Gauge Fields in Condensed Matter&quot;. In this theory, the statistical properties of fluctuating vortex or defect lines are described as elementary excitations with the help of fields, whose Feynman diagrams are the pictures of the lines.

At the 1978 summer school in Erice he proposed the existence of broken supersymmetry in atomic nuclei, which has since been observed experimentally.

His theory of collective quantum fields and the Hadronization of Quark Theories are prototypes for numerous developments in the theory of condensed matter, nuclear and elementary particle physics.

Together with K. Maki he proposed and clarified in 1981 a possible icosahedral phase of quasicrystals.
This structure was discovered three years later in aluminum transition metal alloys by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the
Nobel Prize 2011.

In 2006, he considered the existence of a novel Riemann particle. The experimental verification is still missing.

See historical notes.

==String theory contributions==
In 1986 he introduced stiffness into the theory of strings,
which had formerly been characterized by tension alone. This greatly improved the description of the physical properties of strings. The Russian physicist A. Polyakov
simultaneously proposed a similar extension, and so the model is now known as the Polyakov-Kleinert string .

==Theory of distributions==
Together with A. Chervyakov, Kleinert developed an extension of the theory of distributions from linear spaces to semigroups by defining their products uniquely (in the mathematical theory, only linear combinations are defined). The extension is motivated by the physical requirement that the corresponding path integrals must be invariant under coordinate transformations, which is necessary for the equivalence of the path integral formulation to Schrödinger theory.

==String theory alternative==
As an alternative to string theory, Kleinert used the complete analogy between non-Euclidean geometry and the geometry of crystals with defects to construct a model of the universe called the World Crystal or Planck-Kleinert crystal. In this model, matter creates defects in spacetime which generate curvature. This curvature reproduces all the effects of general relativity, but leads to different physics than string theory at the scale of the Planck length. This theory inspired Italian artist Laura Pesce to create glass sculptures entitled &quot;world crystal&quot; (see also lower left on this page).

==Current work==
Kleinert is a senior member of the faculty for the International Relativistic Astrophysics PhD (IRAP) Project, which forms part of the international network for astrophysics (ICRANet). He was also involved in the European Science Foundation&#x27;s project Cosmology in the Laboratory.

Kleinert&#x27;s 60th birthday was honored by a Festschrift and a Festcolloquium with 65 contributions by international colleagues (for instance Y. Ne&#x27;eman, R. Jackiw, H. Fritzsch, R. Ruffini, C. DeWitt, L. Kauffman, J. Devreese, and K. Maki).

<doc id="1214035" wikidata="Q2751893" url="?curid=1214035" title="Nashville Metros">
<text>The Nashville Metros were an American soccer team based in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. Founded in 1989, the team most recently played in the Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, in the South Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The Metros were the longest continuously operating soccer club in the United Soccer Leagues before their last season in 2012.

In the side&#x27;s later years its home games were contested at Ezell Park and E. S. Rose Park.

==History==
The Nashville Metros were founded by Lynn Agee and Devinder Sandhu and began indoor play in the Sunbelt Independent Soccer League in 1990. Due to a lack of facilities, the team played their entire first season on the road, before settling in Smyrna. The Metros continued to play indoors until 1996, but only won six matches in six seasons. During much of the same period, the outdoor team played in the USL&#x27;s amateur Premier League with significantly better results. Nashville&#x27;s first winning season came in 1995 with a 12–6 record and their first playoff appearance. The 1996 team witnessed the Metros&#x27; Pasi Kinturi score a league-leading 19 goals as he was named that season&#x27;s league MVP.

The Metros moved up to the second division A-League in 1997. After several years of playing at various high school and municipal stadiums in Nashville and Franklin, the team settled into their new home at Ezell Park. Nashville made their first U.S. Open Cup appearance in the 1998 tournament where they routed the third division Delaware Wizards before advancing to face the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer. A heavy underdog, the Metros pulled off the upset of the tournament with a victory over the first division club in front of an ecstatic home crowd. Nashville eventually fell in the quarterfinals to MLS&#x27; Dallas Burn.

In 1999 due to financial circumstances, the club was forced to reorganize. The side was renamed the Tennessee Rhythm and moved from Nashville to Franklin, but returned to their original venue in 2001, reverting to their original name at the same time. This time period featured an unsuccessful rematch against the Dallas Burn in the 2000 U.S. Open Cup and a nationally televised game against the Los Angeles Galaxy in the 2001 tournament. In 2002 the Metros moved down from the A-League to the Premier Development League, mainly due to Ezell Park&#x27;s substandard facilities, such as the lack of a press box.

Beginning with their first playoff appearance in 1994, Nashville made eight postseason trips over the next 11 years.

<doc id="1214038" wikidata="Q8519552" url="?curid=1214038" title="Mount Nebo (Utah)">
<text>Mount Nebo is the southernmost and highest mountain in the Wasatch Range of Utah, in the United States, and the centerpiece of the Mount Nebo Wilderness, inside the Uinta National Forest. It is named after the biblical Mount Nebo in Jordan, overlooking Israel from the east of the Jordan River, which is said to be the place of Moses&#x27; death.

Mount Nebo has two summits: the northern summit reaches , and the southern summit reaches . Early surveys placed the southern peak as the highest, but the mountain was resurveyed in the 1970s and the northern peak was found to be higher. It is the highest point of Utah County and is located in the southern part of the county.

Mount Nebo is an &quot;ultra&quot;, one of 128 ultra-prominent peaks in the United States having more than of topographic prominence. The mountain is typically partially or completely covered in snow from mid-October until July. Nearby towns include Mona (closest), Payson, Nephi, and Provo.

A substantial trail leads to the south summit, accessible from starting points on the east or west of the mountain. Another trail accesses the north summit, starting northeast of the mountain. A &quot;bench trail&quot; runs along the mountain&#x27;s east side from north to south at roughly 9,000 feet elevation. Although strenuous, all of these trails are popular with hikers; many are dangerous places for horseback riders. One old-time local rider warns: &quot;There&#x27;s dead horses in every canyon on that mountain!&quot;

The Mount Nebo Scenic Byway is a federally designated National Scenic Byway which departs I-15 at Payson and travels south through the Mount Nebo Wilderness, climbing to over 9,000 feet before rejoining the interstate at Nephi. The route features panoramic views of Mount Nebo, the Utah Valley, and Utah Lake far below. There are numerous trailheads along the route for the hiking enthusiast, including a short walk to the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, an area that has been described as a &quot;mini Bryce Canyon&quot;.

==Climate==
There is no weather station at the summit, but this climate table contains interpolated data for an area around the summit. Mount Nebo has a subalpine climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).

<text>Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) was a cable television provider in the United States, and for most of its history was controlled by Bob Magness and John Malone.

The company was started in 1958 in Bozeman, Montana as Western Microwave, Inc. and Community Television, Inc., two firms with common ownership. The companies merged in 1968 and operations moved to Denver, taking the name Tele-Communications Inc. It was the largest cable operator in the United States at one time.

After going public in 1970, the company grew rapidly, and became the top cable provider in the United States. After a failed merger attempt with Bell Atlantic in 1994, it was purchased in 1999 by AT&amp;T, whose cable television assets in select markets were later acquired by Charter Communications, Cox Communications, and then Cablevision and Comcast Corporation.

==History==
After graduating from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Bob Magness was a cotton seed salesman and cattle rancher. In 1956, he met two men who were stranded and needed a ride. Learning that they wanted to build a community antenna system in Paducah, Texas, he decided to raise the money for a similar system in Memphis, Texas. He sold his cattle, took out a mortgage on his home and borrowed $2,500 from his father. His wife did the office work while Bob put up the wires himself.

Two years later Magness sold the system and was looking for a way to invest the sales proceeds. Another cable pioneer, Bill Daniels, told him about a community antenna system in Bozeman, Montana. The Kearns-Tribune Corp., publisher of &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;, which owned a cable system in Reno, Nevada, began relaying signals by common carrier microwave from Salt Lake City in 1956. In 1958 it became a partner with Magness in establishing a partnership for cable TV in Montana. George C. Hatch and Brian Glasmann were also partners in the companies known as Community Television Inc. and Western Microwave Inc. The Magness family moved to Bozeman. Six systems were built, serving a total of 12,000 homes.

In 1962, Magness purchased Collier Electric Company, which had subscribers in Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, bringing the total number of subscribers to 18,000. Magness later moved to Scottsbluff, Nebraska.

Over time, Magness acquired more systems but remained in Bozeman. By 1965, Daniels told him the companies needed to be located in a larger city. Salt Lake City and Denver, Colorado, were both considered. In 1968, the companies moved to Denver and became Tele-Communications Inc.

Tele-Communications Inc. went public in 1970. At the time, it was the 10th largest cable company in the United States. By 1972, with 100,000 subscribers, Magness needed someone with more business knowledge to run the operation. He decided on John Malone, president of Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument. Malone took on the bankers who wanted to call in their loans, and effectively saved the company from bankruptcy. Magness made Malone CEO but remained as chairman. By 1982 Malone had made TCI the largest cable company in the United States.

In 1982, Malone hired Peter Barton, who called himself the company&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Olsen&quot; because he just did whatever was needed, fresh from Harvard Business School. Barton went on to become president of TCI&#x27;s Cable Value Network (later QVC) in 1986, and in 1991, president of TCI spinoff Liberty Media. Barton had a playful side and even kept toys in his Liberty Media office, and a gorilla costume to represent his status as &quot;second banana&quot; to Malone. Yet he had a reputation as &quot;a shrewd and sometimes vicious negotiator&quot;.

In 1995, TCI acquired the cable television assets of Viacom.

===First Merger ===
In May 1991 United Artists announced a merger deal with their largest shareholder TCI ( Liberty Media) to form the largest cable operator in the US, a deal valued at $142.5m for the 50% not already owned by TCI. TCI and US West announced a joint venture, and in 1992 the joint venture company became Telewest Communications. By June, the deal was approved. A week later on June 8 the deal was finalized with TCI acquiring the remaining 46% of United Artists, to allow full control.

===Flextech===
During the autumn of 1993 talks were also held with Flextech (a British television programming provider). Under the original terms of the proposed deal, Flextech would acquire TCI&#x27;s European programming business in exchange for shares. By January the deal was complete with TCI acquired 40-60% of Flextech while Flextech acquired 100% of Bravo, 25% of UK Gold, and 31% of UK Living and 25% of the Children&#x27;s Channel which increased its share in that channel.

===Mile High Cablevision===
In Spring of 1995 TCI purchased Mile-Hi Cablevision, the CATV provider for the city of Denver, Colorado and the city of Glendale, Colorado. Mile-Hi Cablevision had been in business since 1983. And prior to the merger, TCI served only the suburbs around the city &amp; county of Denver.

===Merger with Liberty Media ===
In Spring 1993, Bell Atlantic began looking at merger partners, including cable companies. TCI and Liberty Media would be acquired for $11.8 billion in stock and assumption of $9.8 billion in debt. And $5 billion in Liberty properties could likely be added to the deal. Numerous regulatory concerns made the deal tricky; regional telephone companies could not offer long distance service or transmit satellite television services such as Discovery Channel. TCI would also have to sell operations in Bell Atlantic territory. As for antitrust concerns, Bell Atlantic argued that competing telephone services could be offered where TCI had cable systems, and video services could compete with TCI. Vice President Al Gore supported the idea of improving the nation&#x27;s infrastructure, and the business community took his statement to mean administration approval of the merger.

The $33 billion deal, based on a $54 per share price for Bell Atlantic stock, would have been the largest in American telecommunications history, the resulting company serving one in four cable TV customers. But it fell apart for many reasons, including declining stock prices for both companies. Malone, who would have made over $1 billion, wanted more shares of Bell Atlantic when its price dropped below $54, which Ray Smith refused to do because it would lessen the value of existing shares. The two companies also had different cultures. Bell Atlantic paid dividends and was used to being regulated, while TCI tended to invest in the business rather than pay dividends. And thus ended a $20 billion project to expand the information superhighway, though other mergers promised to put the project back on track, with a more local emphasis rather than attempting a nationwide system upgrade.

The Bell Atlantic deal also fell victim to new federal regulations that reduced cable bills up to 16 percent, costing TCI $300 million over two years. Higher spending coupled with lower cash receipts made TCI less attractive to investors, and the stock price dropped to $17 a share, half what experts believed the company was worth. Bill Nygren of Harris Associates, known for profiting from TCI&#x27;s Liberty Media, said TCI could make a comeback, and Michael Mahoney of GT Capital expected the proposed deregulation of the cable and telephone industries to increase cable company revenues. Both expected TCI to benefit, especially since TCI owned 30 percent of a joint venture that included Sprint and 10 cable companies with the ability to serve 40 percent of American homes. Cable and phone companies could both offer each other&#x27;s services, benefiting both companies and customers with product bundling. TCI had plans to upgrade to digital cable and offer more channels and services. Satellite TV providers would be competing to offer digital service, but TCI owned a share of Primestar, and predicted a 28 percent share of the satellite market by the end of 1995.

In Fall 1995, Time Warner agreed to exchange $8 billion in stock for 82 percent of Turner Broadcasting System. TCI would trade its 21 percent interest in Turner for the third largest stake in Time Warner, or 9 percent. Since the resulting companies would have 40 percent of cable households, enough to cause anti-trust concern, TCI agreed to let Time Warner&#x27;s Gerald Levin represent TCI. This did not satisfy federal regulators. Malone ended the 15 percent discount on Turner programming that would have lasted 20 years, and Time Warner had to pay $67 million to cover TCI&#x27;s taxes due.

Magness died in November 1996, with a 26 percent share of the company. No one believed this meant the end of Malone&#x27;s tenure as head of TCI, even though Malone called Magness his &quot;mentor&quot; and &quot;father figure&quot;. Still, TCI had $15 billion in debt and negative cash flow of $400 million for 1996. Malone believed he could turn the company around. This meant higher rates for customers as well as programmers. Malone even succeeded in getting Fox News Channel to pay $200 million for his companies to add the network. At the same time, cost cutting had to take place, and many of the cable customers were in rural areas with old equipment and limited offerings. Upgrading to fiber optic service, which could be used for Internet and telephone service, would be cost-effective only in urban areas. Satellite TV, while not a major threat yet, represented a possible problem in the future. The good news: satellite companies could not offer local channels or phone service, and individual dishes served only one TV.

The new technologies had two benefits for TCI. First, customers would need set-top boxes, which TCI already had ordered from General Instrument. Another advantage was technology developed by a new company called Imedia which would allow four times as many channels to be delivered using existing technology, even in areas not getting fiber-optic service.

On the other hand, digital service had its disadvantages. Customers who did not even want a box would still lose channels so that digital channels could be added. And General Instrument only reluctantly agreed to allow multiple suppliers to bring TCI&#x27;s costs down.

In 1997 TCI sold ten of its cable systems in NJ and NY to Cablevision.

TCI improved its fortunes, hiring Leo Hindery as president and making Malone chairman and CEO. Still, it was regarded as a company likely to be taken over. TCI was acquired by AT&amp;T in 1999 and in 2002, Comcast acquired the rest of TCI&#x27;s cable television systems.

==Merger==
In 1997 TCI merged with the Kearns-Tribune Corp., publisher of &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot;, Utah&#x27;s largest newspaper. Kearns-Tribune Corp. was a large holder of TCI stock.

On June 24, 1998, AT&amp;T, the nation&#x27;s largest provider of telephone service, announced a plan to buy TCI, second to Time Warner among cable operators with 13 million customers, for $32 billion in stock and $16 billion in assumed debt. This marked the first major merger between phone and cable since deregulation. The new company, to be called AT&amp;T Consumer Services, planned to &quot;significantly accelerate&quot; efforts to offer digital telephone, data and video services as the companies combined the long distance, wireless and dial-up Internet service of AT&amp;T with the cable, high-speed Internet and telecommunications services of TCI. For the first time, AT&amp;T would be able to offer local telephone service. To do this, the company could have bought a Baby Bell such as SBC Communications (which purchased AT&amp;T in 2005 and took the AT&amp;T name), but this would have meant regulatory problems. Liberty Media stockholders would receive separate tracking stock.

Federal regulators and the two companies&#x27; shareholders approved the merger February 17, 1999. By that time, the value of the stock portion of the deal had increased to $43.5 billion. The Federal Communications Commission did not require TCI to give other companies access to its cable lines, despite requests by America Online and others. TCI had made its cable lines capable of providing Internet access, and AT&amp;T wanted those same lines to provide local phone service, which it was already doing in another agreement with Time Warner.

AT&amp;T completed its acquisition March 9, 1999, and TCI became AT&amp;T Broadband and Internet Services, the company&#x27;s largest unit, with Hindery its chief executive. Malone moved over to Liberty Media, which remained a separate stock and included newer TCI businesses under the heading of TCI Ventures.

<text>The Queen Elizabeth Ranges is a group of mountain ranges in the Canadian Rockies on the southeastern side of Jasper National Park, Canada. The northern end of the ranges begins east of Medicine Lake and extends in a southeasterly direction past the southern shore of Maligne Lake. The group was named in 1953 to celebrate the coronation of Elizabeth II as Canada&#x27;s sovereign.

These ranges include the following mountains and peaks:

<text>New York Airways was an American helicopter airline in the New York City area, founded in 1949 as a mail and cargo carrier. On 9 July 1953 it may have been the first scheduled helicopter airline to carry passengers in the United States, with headquarters at LaGuardia Airport. Although primarily a helicopter airline operator with scheduled passenger operations, New York Airways also flew fixed wing aircraft, such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 19-passenger STOL twin turboprop aircraft.

==History==

Passenger flights started with Sikorsky S-55 helicopters, with three Sikorsky S-58s added to its five S-55s in 1956; in 1958 the Boeing Vertol V-44, a 15-seat civil version of the Piasecki H-21, took over. In 1962 they transitioned to the tandem rotor, twin turbine engine powered Boeing Vertol 107-II Turbocopter and later operated the twin turbine engine Sikorsky S-61. In February 1955 the one-way fare from LaGuardia to Idlewild was $4.50 ($ in dollars). The aircraft was a Sikorsky H-19, registration number N418A. The trip took ten minutes and their phone number was DEfender 5-6600.

The first scheduled passenger flights to Manhattan arrived in December 1956 at the West 30th Street Heliport. The downtown heliport on East River Pier 6 opened in 1960 and New York Airways moved all its Manhattan passenger flights down there around December 1960. Due to route restrictions on the single-engine Vertol 44, nonstop flights from Manhattan to Idlewild had to await the twin-engine Boeing Vertol 107. Moody&#x27;s says in 1962 the &quot;operating revenue&quot; of $3.9 million included $2.2 million federal subsidy. In June 1964 they had 32 daily flights from JFK to Newark Airport and 33 returning; all flights each way between about 0900 and 1930 stopped at Wall Street. The only other flights were 15 round trips a day between JFK and the Port Authority building at the World&#x27;s Fair, as La Guardia was still under construction.

Scheduled flights to the top of the Pan Am Building (now MetLife Building) began in December 1965; they ended in 1968, then resumed for a few months in 1977. In April 1966 23 flights a day flew nonstop to Pan Am&#x27;s terminal at JFK, scheduled 10 minutes; passengers could check in at the Pan Am Building 40 minutes before their scheduled departure out of JFK. The downtown heliport had 13 flights a day to Newark, 5 nonstops to TWA&#x27;s terminal at JFK and 12 to LGA, all of which continued to JFK. (Downtown had no weekend flights.) Soon after Pan Am Building flights resumed the March 1977 Official Airline Guide (OAG) showed 48 weekday S-61 departures from there: 12 to EWR, 14 to LGA then JFK, and 22 nonstops to JFK.

New York Airways employed the first African American airline pilot. Perry H. Young made his historic first flight on February 5, 1957. Young had previously made history as the first African American flight instructor for the United States Army Air Corps.

==Destinations==
At its peak the airline partnered with 24 international and domestic airlines. At various times it served:
* John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
* LaGuardia Airport (LGA)
* Newark Airport (EWR)
* West 30th St, Manhattan
* Pan Am Building roof-top heliport
* Wall Street Heliport 
* Battery Park City Heliport
* Stamford, Connecticut Heliport
* Teterboro Airport (TEB)
* Westchester County Airport (HPN)
* Downtown Trenton
* New Brunswick 
* Hadley Field 
* Morristown Municipal Airport

In 1969 the Official Airline Guide (OAG) listed some inter-airport flights using STOL Twin Otters along with the Vertol flights. Fuel prices soared after the 1973 oil crisis, damaging profitability. The airline could not recover after the 1977 Pan Am Building accident and the 1979 oil crisis, and New York Airways filed for bankruptcy on May 18, 1979.
The number of passengers boarded, in thousands, scheduled flights only were 68 in 1957, 144 in 1960, 537 in 1967, 268 in 1970.

==Fleet==

All surviving New York Airways Boeing Vertol 107s are now operated by Columbia Helicopters, based in Aurora, Oregon:
*N6672D
*N6674D
*N6675D
*N6676D
*N6682D
*N107PA (Operated under contract to Pan Am)
*N108PA (Operated under contract to Pan Am)
N6674D is the highest flying time helicopter in the world, with more than 82,000 flight hours since its construction in 1962.

N6682D is in the 1968 film &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, starring Clint Eastwood, taking off atop the Pan Am Building. N108PA is the helicopter arriving with Eastwood.

N6676D is shown taking off from the Downtown Manhattan/Wall St. Heliport in the last of the Secret Agent 077 trilogy of films, 1966&#x27;s Special Mission Lady Chaplin. It appears in the 1967 spy thriller Matchless, arriving and taking off from the Pan Am Building.

==Accidents==
On October 14, 1963, New York Airways Flight 600, a Boeing Vertol 107, registration N6673D, crashed shortly after takeoff from Idlewild Airport (now JFK) en route to Newark via Wall Street. All three passengers and all three crew members died. The accident was caused by mechanical failure due to contaminated lubricants.

On July 15, 1969, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 200 N558MA was 12 minutes behind schedule on a flight from New York to Newark, so the pilot decided to take off from a runway intersection. During initial climb the plane was caught in the wake vortex of a departing jet and crashed, killing 3 (2 crew and 1 passenger) of the 14 occupants.

On May 16, 1977, the landing gear failed on a Sikorsky S-61L (N619PA) while it was taking on passengers on the roof of the Pan Am Building. The aircraft fell onto its side. Its spinning principal rotor blades killed four passengers waiting to board (including movie director Michael Findlay) and injured a fifth. Parts of a broken blade fell into the streets below, killing one pedestrian and injuring another. The accident precipitated the permanent closure of the heliport. The Cinema Museum in London holds film of this helicopter from summer 1963.

On April 18, 1979, a Sikorsky S-61L (N618PA), while on departure climbout from Newark International Airport, experienced a fracture of one of the tail rotor blades, resulting in severe vibrations and an immediate return and descent to the airport. At about 150 feet altitude, the entire tail rotor gearbox was torn from the aircraft, resulting in an immediate and radical center of gravity change to the aircraft. This caused a severe nose down attitude and uncontrolled contact with the ground. Compounding the accident was the failure of both hydraulic systems due to the loss of the tail rotor gear box, which rendered the aircraft virtually uncontrollable. There were three fatalities and thirteen serious injuries. The airline ceased flying that day and never resumed operations, filing for bankruptcy the following month.

<doc id="1214056" wikidata="Q7227974" url="?curid=1214056" title="Ponsonby, New Zealand">
<text>Ponsonby () is an inner-city suburb of Auckland located 2 km west of the Auckland CBD. The suburb is oriented along a ridge running north–south, which is followed by the main street of the suburb, Ponsonby Road.

Ponsonby was originally a working-class neighbourhood until going through a period gentrification that saw upper-middle class residents move to the area starting in the 1970s.

Three Lamps is an area of Ponsonby located at the intersection of Ponsonby Road, College Hill, and St Marys Road. This name is derived from a 19th-century Lamppost.

== Etymology ==
The area now referred to as Three Lamps was originally called Dedwood in 1845, after a farm in Shelly Beach Road, which was apparently named after a Captain Dedwood. The name was changed to Ponsonby in 1873, apparently derived from Ponsonby Road. The name Ponsonby Road, which appears as early as 1860 on a map of Auckland, and reportedly was also recorded earlier in the 1850s.
There are various people who might have inspired the name Ponsonby:

* Major-General Sir Henry Ponsonby, private secretary to Queen Victoria, 1870–1895
* The Honourable Ponsonby Peacocke, a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council who lived on Ponsonby Road in the 1860s
* Major-General Sir Frederick Ponsonby, a cavalry commander in the Napoleonic Wars and later Governor of Malta (and father of Henry Ponsonby)
* Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, a cavalry commander killed at Waterloo

The Māori name for the ridge is (&#x27;The Lone Rimu Tree&#x27;), referring to an ancient tree which, it is claimed, stood in a prominent position at what is now the intersection of Ponsonby Road and Karangahape Road.

== History ==
The Auckland region was settled by Māori not long after their arrival, and by the 15th century, they had several fishing and gardening circuits in the area. In Ponsonby, there was a harvesting place for Kuta alongside the Waikuta Stream that flowed down College Hill.

In 1840 3,000 acres of land, which includes land that would become Ponsonby, was gifted from Apihai Te Kawau to Governor William Hobson to serve as the new capital of New Zealand. Ponsonby saw residential growth as &quot;Dedwood&quot; in the 1840s and 1850s with saw mills and shipyards supporting a small work force.

In 1853, Bishop Pompallier purchased 40 acres (160,000 m2), what was later known as St Mary&#x27;s Mount, which saw a large Catholic immigration to the area. Later in 1853, Bishop Pompallier moved St Mary&#x27;s College for Catechists on the North Shore to St Mary&#x27;s Bay, and St. Marys School for Boys &amp; a Seminary were built on 5 acres (20,000 m2) of Crown Grant land at the end of Waitemata St. In 1855, formerly the Bishop Pompallier House became St. Anne&#x27;s School for Māori Girls run by the Sisters of Mercy. It was later known as the James O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s house, and is now a category 1 listed building with Heritage New Zealand. In 1858, &quot;The Church of the Immaculate Conception&quot; was built and later demolished in 1869 – 70, and is now the site of the Pompallier Tennis Club. In 1859, New Street was put through the middle of the St Mary&#x27;s Mount, and the eastern side of the street was presented to be the place for St Mary&#x27;s College. The Nazareth Institute for Maori and Half-Caste Girls was founded in 1863. 

In the 1860s, the land around the church, convent, and schools was purchased by many Catholics, and the street names such as Pompallier Terrace, Curran, and Dublin, Green Streets reflect the Irish and Catholic identity of the neighbourhood. There was significant debt accrued by Bishop Pompallier in the setting up of the missions around the country, which resulted in 1863, the selling of part of the 40 acres, retaining only 4 acres (16,000 m2). In 1863, St Mary&#x27;s College, the convent, and orphanage were moved to the New Street site and, in 1866, St Mary&#x27;s Old Convent Chapel was constructed, designed by Edward Mahoney. On 23 March 1869, Bishop Pompallier resigns and returns to France, leaving behind a diocese that still had a considerable amount of debt. The Bishop was forced to sell the remaining land, including the Bishop&#x27;s House. The site on New Street was then purchased back in 1873, and the current Bishop&#x27;s House still stands on the site.

In the 1870s, Ponsonby&#x27;s houses continued to grow in number as the population of Auckland increased. In 1873, the name of the area was officially changed from Dedwood to Ponsonby. In 1882, the Ponsonby Highway Board was amalgamated with Auckland City Council. In 1884, the first horse tram service from Queen Street to Ponsonby is started. The horse drawn service was later replaced in 1902 with electric trams. This led to more residential and commercial development in the Ponsonby area.

Around the dawn of the 20th century complaints were raised as to the quality and state of housing in the area. Ponsonby was considered an overcrowded area. In 1917, the Victoria Park Market-City Destructor was built to begin to manage rubbish for the area. It was later equipped with a generator, providing the first public electricity supply to Auckland. During World War II, Victoria Park was the location of an American army camp.

In 1947, the first Pacific church in New Zealand, Newton Pacific Islanders Congregational Church was established on Edinburgh St, off Karangahape Rd. During the 1940s to the 1970s, there were many Pacific Islanders arriving in the country and many settled in Auckland, especially in the Ponsonby area. In the 1950s and 1960s, a combination of people moving to new outer suburbs, Auckland City Council policy of &quot;slum&quot; clearances and the construction of the motorway through Freemans Bay, led to significantly lower rents and a economic downturn in the area directly west of the CBD including Ponsonby.

In the 1970s, Ponsonby was home to various artists, as well as civil rights groups, unions, LGBTQ+, environmental and feminist groups. It was known as the birthplace of New Zealand Reggae and the Rastafarian Movement in New Zealand. In 1971, the Polynesian Panthers were first established in Ponsonby. From 1973 to 1979, Pacific families living in Ponsonby, and the rest of New Zealand, were subjected to the Dawn Raids - immigration raids targeting overstayers that overwhelmingly targeted Pacific Islanders. Increasing fuel prices and other factors led to more central locations becoming desirable and increasing rents increasingly pushed the Pacific community and students out of Ponsonby. 

In 1979, the New Zealand Muslim Association starts construction work on the first mosque in New Zealand at 17 Vermont Street. In 1983, the Victoria Park Market opened in the old Victoria Park Market-City Destructor buildings.

In 1992, The Franklin Road Christmas lights display first ran. Over 100 houses on the street participate in decorating their homes with Christmas lights for free public viewing. It has since ran each year. 

In 1996, The Hero Parade moved from Queen Street to Ponsonby Road. In 2013, the Auckland Pride Festival Parade then returned to Ponsonby.

==Three Lamps==

Three Lamps is an area of Ponsonby around the intersection of Ponsonby Road, St Marys Road, Jervois Road and College Hill. It is named after a lamp that was located at the centre of the intersection. The lamp was removed in the 1930s as a traffic hazard. It was later replaced with a replica on the footpath in 2012.

<text>Sprecher Brewery is a brewery in Glendale, Wisconsin, U.S. It was founded in 1985 in Milwaukee by Randal Sprecher, and is Milwaukee&#x27;s first craft brewery since Prohibition. Sprecher produces an assortment of beers, flavored malt beverages, and craft sodas, and it is famous for its root beer.

Despite producing a full range of award-winning craft beers, the brewery is arguably best known for its Black Bavarian (schwarzbier) and premium sodas. Sprecher brews more root beer than all of its alcoholic beers combined.

==History==

The founder, Randal Sprecher, a California native, earned his first degree in oceanography and his second in brewing. He was employed by Pabst in Milwaukee. After just over four years at Pabst, he founded his own brewery in 1985. The new brewery was started on a budget of $40,000. Sprecher hand-manufactured and purchased equipment to keep costs down, including a 16-oz. bottling machine from Coca-Cola, and some of this equipment remains in use today. The current Sprecher facility was acquired in 1994.

In January 2020, a group of local investors acquired Sprecher Brewery, with Sharad Chadha taking the helm as CEO and President. The new leadership expanded distribution by 10 states, up to 30 total, and grew production capacity by added a new canning line and warehouse space. Over the course of two years, the company doubled to 110 people and went from running a single shift four days a week to double shifts five days a week with the capacity to expand further. In October 2021, Sprecher acquired six soda brands from Chicago-based WIT Beverage Co., including Green River.

In January 2022, Sprecher transitioned all of its beer styles from bottles to cans, and accompanied a brand refresh with new labels.

In October 2023, Sprecher acquired Ooh La Lemin Lemonade from Kona Gold Beverages. Also in October 2023, Sprecher acquired a packaging company called Excent, LLC.

In January 2024, Sprecher acquired Juvee.

==Production==
Raw Wisconsin honey is used as a primary ingredient in its root beer, and Sprecher Ginger Ale uses locally grown ginger. Sprecher&#x27;s recipe and method for producing its root beer has remained unchanged since its founding. The brewing uses a &quot;fire-brewed&quot; process that brews in a kettle with fire underneath, rather than steam, which caramelizes the sugars and helps blend flavors and create complexity.

These sodas are fairly rare in the soft drink industry in that they are sweetened with pure honey rather than sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or a newer artificial sweetener.

== Brewery tour ==

Sprecher Brewery offers year-round tours of its facility, including the brew house, the refrigerated cellar, and the bottling line and warehouse. Tours conclude in the indoor beer garden where customers are welcome to sample a wide range of beers and sodas on tap.

===Traveling beer garden===
Sprecher has two sets of firetrucks and ambulances that serve as Milwaukee County Parks Traveling Beer Gardens from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Each set visits a Milwaukee County Park for ten days, then moves to another location throughout the summer.

==Recognition==

Sprecher has earned awards for 25 different beer types in prestigious national and international competitions. Awards include: 2004 GABF Small Brewing Company of the Year and 2004 GABF Small Brewing Company Brewmaster of the Year. 2007 Australian International Beer Awards, Best of Show &amp; Gold Medal - Russian Imperial Stout; Dopple Bock - Silver; Piper&#x27;s Scotch Ale - Bronze; 2014 World Beer Cup, Gold - Black Bavarian (Schwarzbier); Bronze - Shakparo (Gluten free); 2004, Bronze - Winter Brew; 2002, Gold - Winter Brew. Several awards annually at both the Los Angeles International Beer Competition and the United States Open Beer Championships.

In a 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; taste test, four judges ranked Sprecher&#x27;s number one among 25 root beers from across the United States for its &quot;wonderfully balanced and complex brew.&quot; A review in the October 2009 edition of &quot;Details&quot; also praised the root beer as &quot;elegant.&quot;

==In popular culture==

2005: Won &quot;Most Deserving Small Business Office&quot; Makeover from Xerox, Hon Furniture and Entrepreneur magazine. Featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show.
In November 2006, a contestant on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; was offered a life-time supply of Sprecher&#x27;s Root Beer, his favorite soda.

<doc id="1214065" wikidata="Q2596124" url="?curid=1214065" title="Crimson King">
<text>The Crimson King, known to some as Los&#x27; or Ram Abbalah, is a fictional character created by Stephen King and the main antagonist of King&#x27;s eight-volume &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, as well as the novels &quot;Insomnia&quot; (1994) and &quot;Black House&quot; (2001). Described as &quot;Gan&#x27;s crazy side&quot;, the Crimson King is the ultimate ruler of the Red (also called the Random and the Outer Dark), and the archetypal embodiment of evil in Stephen King&#x27;s fictional multiverse. His goal is to topple the Dark Tower which serves as the linchpin of time and space, destroying the multitude of universes which revolve around it so that he can rule in the primordial chaos which follows.

==Appearances==
===Literature===
The Crimson King is introduced in the Stephen King novel &quot;Insomnia&quot;, where he is depicted as a powerful and mysterious entity that forces others to do his bidding. He seeks to kill a child named Patrick Danville who is prophesied to aid in bringing the King down; he is defeated during a confrontation with that novel&#x27;s protagonist, Ralph Roberts.

He makes his next appearance at the end of &quot;Black House&quot;, where he is revealed to be responsible for the events of that novel and is seen to have been weakened by the actions of protagonist Jack Sawyer and his allies.

In the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novels, the King is revealed to be behind the destruction of the beams that hold up the Dark Tower, which holds reality and all of the universes together. He is also master of the series&#x27; main villain, Walter O&#x27;Dim/Padick. He is shown to have gone insane and his intentions are not quite clear beyond that he wishes to destroy the Tower and possibly rule the darkness that would follow. He rules from the lands of Discordia and, as his insanity worsens, he kills nearly everyone in his employ and even himself. He thus becomes undead and possibly immune to protagonist Roland Deschain&#x27;s guns. He reaches the tower before Roland, but is trapped on a balcony on one of its lower levels. When Roland finally meets the King at the climax of the final &quot;Dark Tower&quot; novel, he appears as an old man with a white beard and blood-red eyes who throws &quot;sneetches&quot; from his imprisonment in the Tower. As previously predicted, Roland and Patrick Danville bring about the Crimson King&#x27;s downfall. Patrick captures the King&#x27;s image with his supernatural artistic abilities, using a mixture of Roland&#x27;s blood and a rose&#x27;s petals to finish the drawing; then he erases the King from existence, forever banishing him to some other world, or to the todash space between the worlds. Only his red eyes remain, trapped eternally on the balcony of the Tower.

===Comics===
Writer Robin Furth wrote a new backstory for the Crimson King in the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; comics. Here, the Crimson King was the bastard offspring of Arthur Eld, a legendary gunslinger, and the Crimson Queen, a demonic creature of the Prim – the chaotic primordial void from which the Dark Tower, and all universes, arose. With the aid of the wizard Maerlyn, the Crimson Queen took on human form and deceived Arthur Eld to achieve this union. Roland Deschain is himself a distant descendant of Eld; this makes the Crimson King Roland&#x27;s half-uncle, albeit through many generations. This is the key through which Roland can defeat the King, as stated in a prophecy laid out during the course of the series. In the one-shot comic &quot;The Dark Tower: The Sorcerer&quot;, Randall Flagg and the Pink Grapefruit (one of the 13 Bends o&#x27; the Rainbow) refer to the Crimson King as their cousin.

== Characteristics ==
The Crimson King has taken many forms throughout the series. In &quot;The Dark Tower VI&quot;, Susannah Dean explains that, in her world, people see the Crimson King as a horned, red-skinned monster called Satan. As evidenced in &quot;Insomnia&quot;, the Crimson King is a shapeshifter; like the titular creature in &quot;It&quot;, he takes the form most terrifying to whoever confronts him. When he is injured by Ralph Roberts, he reverts first to a handsome, blonde man, and then to a creature Ralph is unable to see properly, suggesting that his true form is incomprehensible to human beings. When he finally appears near the end of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, the Crimson King has the appearance of an old man with white hair and one fang, but in the comics he appears both as a monstrous entity with spiderlike characteristics, much like his son Mordred, as well as a bald man with a large tusk or horn on his head. Throughout all of his appearances his one defining characteristic is his blood red eyes, which fascinate anyone who looks into them. Patrick Danville also mentions that the King fades in and out of view due to his transcendent magical powers.

The Crimson King prefers to work from behind the scenes. His sigil, a glaring red eye, is seen throughout each of the books in which he has appeared. He employs other people to do his bidding, as well as numerous supernatural beings, including Atropos, Mr. Munshun, Dandelo, Randall Flagg, John Farson, and various vampires, low men, and taheen.

== In other King works ==
The Crimson King is also mentioned in the Stephen King novella &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot;, found within the 1999 collection &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;.

He is also hinted at in &quot;The Stand&quot; by Mother Abagail. As she describes main antagonist Randall Flagg, she mentions that, &quot;He ain&#x27;t Satan, but he and Satan know of each other and have kept their councils together of old.&quot;

<text>Jimmy Roberts (born 1957) is a sportscaster for NBC Sports. Roberts joined NBC in May 2000 after serving as a sports reporter for almost 12 years at ESPN and ABC Sports, winning Emmy awards throughout his career.

==Early life and career==
Roberts grew up in White Plains, New York. His father, Ralph, traded securities with the investment firm Moore &amp; Schley in New York. His mother, Betty, taught first grade at the Ridgeway School in White Plains. 

While attending White Plains High School, Roberts captained the varsity lacrosse team. He was also the school&#x27;s morning announcer and occasionally wrote columns for his high-school newspaper, &quot;The Orange&quot;.

Roberts went on to study at the University of Maryland, College Park. During his time at Maryland, Roberts worked at the popular campus hangout R.J. Bentley&#x27;s, where one of his Emmy Awards is now displayed. While still at college, he began work at ABC Sports as a production runner, supporting the outside broadcast team as they covered the lacrosse national championship for “Wide World of Sports.”

==ABC, ESPN and NBC Sports==
Roberts&#x27; career has substantially been with NBC as a sports presenter. He began with the network briefly as a production assistant at the 1980 Lake Placid games. He covered the speed skating competition and, witnessing Eric Heiden&#x27;s record five individual gold medals, came to regard it as history&#x27;s greatest athletic achievement. Though he regards Dan Jansen&#x27;s 1,000 metre win at the 1994 Winter Olympics as the most memorable sporting event he has televised. 

His first roles as a sports TV writer and associate producer were with ABC, under Howard Cosell, on “SportsBeat,” a 30-minute investigative program. His work won him his first Emmy Award in 1984. He left the network to join ESPN. Having them sent an audition tape, he was hired by John Walsh who was running SportsCenter. The first sporting event he presented was the heavyweight championship bout between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks in 1988. He became the cable channel&#x27;s main presenter for boxing, and golf, for the next ten years.

In 1999, NBC approached Roberts as they needed a presenter for the upcoming 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. In this time, he became known as an essayist with a sense of story, remembered for his Olympic reports on Eric the Eel and other idiosyncratic sports personalities. 

He has remained with the network ever since, hosting golf coverage on NBC and its Golf Channel. Other NBC assignments over the years for Roberts include hosting the halftime show for Notre Dame football, being one of the main anchors for NBC&#x27;s weekend sports updates, anchoring the network&#x27;s coverage of the French Open, and worked as a field reporter for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the 2000 American League Championship Series. He has also reported on horse racing for NBC. Roberts hosted and narrated the Outdoor Life Network&#x27;s coverage of the 2005 Dakar Rally. 

In presenting the 2024 Summer Olympics from Paris for NBC, Roberts had covered 20 Olympic Games over his broadcasting career. Roberts has been honoured with 15 Emmy Awards in this time, along with Lincoln Werden Award for golf writers, in 2023. 

==Other work==
In April 2009, Roberts published his first book, &quot;Breaking the Slump&quot;, which detailed the struggles of many famous golfers, including Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, George Herbert Walker Bush, and others and how they found their way through the inevitable challenges that plague anyone who plays the game. In 2022, Roberts co-authored “No One Wins Alone” with NHL hall of famer Mark Messier. The book was a memoir about Messier’s career which focused on leadership. 

==Personal life==
Roberts&#x27;s father, Ralph, had been a US soldier, serving in the regiment which liberated the French town of Farébersviller. The story of the battle was narrated by Jimmy Roberts in a special feature for NBC, which he described as &quot;the best thing I&#x27;ve done.&quot; 

In 1994, Roberts married Sandra Mayer, a producer for &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; at NBC. The couple have lived in Rye in Westchester County, New York since then, raising three sons.

Roberts&#x27; sister-in-law, Debbie Mayer, worked in the south tower on the 56th floor at New York City&#x27;s World Trade Center. Immediately after American Airlines Flight 11 (the first aircraft of the September 11, 2001, attacks) struck the north tower, Mayer began going downstairs to leave the building. She had gotten to the 29th floor when the second aircraft struck, hitting the building she worked in. However, Mayer escaped safely before the towers collapsed.

Roberts told of the ordeal to &quot;USA Today&quot;:

We had a couple of very anxious hours. My wife couldn&#x27;t get through to Debbie. Finally, she went to her Manhattan apartment to wait for her. And she found her there. Turns out when the first explosion occurred in Building 1, Debbie started down the stairs. She had made it to the 29th floor when the building was shaken when the second plane hit. She was terrified but made it out.

<text>Notre Dame Island () is an artificial island in the Saint Lawrence River in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is immediately to the east of Saint Helen&#x27;s Island and west of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the city of Saint-Lambert on the south shore. Together with Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, it makes up Parc Jean-Drapeau, which forms part of the Hochelaga Archipelago. To the southeast, the island is connected to the embankment separating the seaway and Lachine Rapids.

Parc Jean-Drapeau is registered as a leg of the Route Verte and Trans Canada Trail. The island contains the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which hosts the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix.

==History==
Notre Dame Island was built in ten months from 15 million tons of rock excavated for the Montreal Metro in the early 1960s. It was created for Expo 67 to celebrate Canada&#x27;s centennial.

Nearly all of the remaining Expo 67 pavilions were demolished in 1975 to make way for a long rowing and canoeing basin for Montreal&#x27;s 1976 Summer Olympics. The Olympic Basin is still North America&#x27;s largest artificial rowing basin. The former pavilion of France and the pavillon of Quebec was gutted, redecorated, and became the Montreal Casino, as a large gambling establishment owned and operated by the Government of Quebec. The Canadian Pavilion now serves the administration of the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau, a para-municipal body of the city of Montreal, manager of Parc Jean-Drapeau.

The park area on the island&#x27;s southern tip has a small lake with a beach open throughout the summer for swimming, volleyball and watercraft rentals. During the decades since Expo 67, the city of Montreal has embellished the island with plants and trees, making it look less artificial.

In 1978, Circuit Île Notre-Dame was opened, which uses the roads of the island for motorsport events in the summer months. The circuit was renamed in 1982 after Canadian Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve following his death earlier that year.

In 1980, the greening and beautification of the island was accelerated when it was the host to the &quot;Floralies Internationales&quot;, a horticultural exhibition and competition gathering plant masterpieces from dozens of countries. Still accessible today from spring to autumn, these gardens cover over . The Floralies gardens are preserved and arranged creatively by the Parc Jean-Drapeau team of gardeners. In addition, the micro-climate created in part by the lagoons crisscrossing the island promotes the uniqueness of these gardens by allowing plants usually intolerant of Montreal&#x27;s cold climate to grow.

The park hosted the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 1986.

==Off-season==
In fall and spring, visitors to Notre Dame Island primarily consist of gamblers at the casino and rowers and canoers at the Olympic Basin. During the coldest part of winter, ice skaters use the basin as a rink. City workers clear the snow from its icy surface as part of the annual winter festival, &quot;La Fête des Neiges de Montréal&quot;. However, the ice rink was located on Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, close to the Jean-Drapeau metro station, the past few years. Cross-country skiers and snowshoers can also tour the area.

==Circuit Gilles Villeneuve==
Each summer, Notre-Dame Island&#x27;s Circuit Gilles Villeneuve hosts the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix race and used to host the NAPA Auto Parts 200 of NASCAR&#x27;s Nationwide Series (now known as the Xfinity Series). The circuit is accessible to the public when it is not being used for motorsports for walking, running, biking, in-line skating, and driving.

<text>Ōrākei is a suburb of Auckland city, in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located on a peninsula five kilometres to the east of the city centre, on the shore of the Waitematā Harbour, which lies to the north, and Hobson Bay and Ōrākei Basin, two arms of the Waitematā, which lie to the west and south. To the east is the suburb of Mission Bay. Takaparawhau / Bastion Point is a coastal piece of land in Ōrākei. Between Takaparawhau and Paritai Drive is Ōkahu Bay and Reserve.

==Overview==
The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of adornment&quot; for the Māori name of Ōrākei.

Takaparawhau / Bastion Point is the location of Ōrākei Marae and its &quot;Tumutumuwhenua&quot; wharenui (meeting house) is a traditional tribal meeting ground for the Ngāti Whātua iwi (tribe) and their Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, Ngā Oho, Te Taoū and Te Uri hapū (sub-tribes). In the 1940s, the Ōrākei pā (village) was one of the last places where traditional pre-European kūmara cultivars (either hutihuti or rekamaroa) were grown.

Takaparawhau / Bastion Point is also the location of the &quot;Savage Memorial&quot;, the tomb and memorial garden for Michael Joseph Savage, the first Labour Party prime minister of New Zealand and one of the country&#x27;s most popular prime ministers, who died in office in 1940. The Art Deco ensemble designed by Tibor Donner and Anthony Bartlett was officially opened in March 1943 and has expansive views of the Waitemata Harbour.

== History ==
The Ōrākei block was historically occupied by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, and before the colonisation of New Zealand it was part of important lands for the hapū, overlooking rich fishing and farming areas. The land was confiscated by the New Zealand Government for public works and development over a period stretching from the 1840s into the 1950s.

Ōrākei was the first location where the New Zealand Flying School operated from between October and November 1915, before moving to Mission Bay, and a permanent location at Kohimarama in 1916.

In 1936-37 John A. Lee proposed to evict the 120 Māori living in the foreshore pā at Takaparawhau / Bastion Point and to include the land in the proposed Ōrākei state housing scheme; the proposal (seen as using Māori land as a park &quot;for white children&quot;) attracted many local objections (including Robin Hyde in &quot;No More Dancing at Orakei&quot;) and was reversed by Prime Minister Savage on his return from overseas.

In 1976 the Crown announced that it planned to develop Bastion Point by selling it to the highest bidder for high-income housing. Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, and other activists, formed the &quot;Ōrākei Māori Action Committee&quot;, taking direct action to stop the subdivision. In 1977–1978 the &quot;Ōrākei Māori Action Committee&quot; organised an occupation of the remaining Crown land that lasted for 506 days. The occupation and the use of force to end it played a part in highlighting injustices against Māori, and the occupation became a major landmark in the history of Māori protest.

In 1988 the New Zealand Labour Government returned Takaparawhau / Bastion Point and Ōrākei Marae to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, with compensation, as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement process.

Under the 1991 Orakei Act, parts of Takaparawhau, including the marae, church, and now developed land, were reserved for Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. The rest of Takaparawhau, Ōkahu Reserve and the foreshore land were set aside &quot;as Maori reservation ... for the common use and benefit of the members of the hapu and the citizens of the City of Auckland&quot;. Collectively called the &quot;Whenua Rangatira&quot; (noble or chiefly land), these areas are administered by the Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei Reserves Board, equally represented by Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei and Auckland Council.

<doc id="1214092" wikidata="Q1849062" url="?curid=1214092" title="Steve Van Buren">
<text>Stephen Wood Van Buren (December 28, 1920 − August 23, 2012) was a Honduran-American professional football halfback who played for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL) from 1944 to 1951. Regarded as a powerful and punishing runner with excellent speed, through eight NFL seasons he won four NFL rushing titles, including three straight from 1947 to 1949. At a time when teams played 12 games a year, he was the first NFL player to rush for over ten touchdowns in a season—a feat he accomplished three times—and the first to have multiple 1,000-yard rushing seasons. When he retired, he held the NFL career records for rushing attempts, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns.

Van Buren played college football for the LSU Tigers, where he led the NCAA in scoring in his senior season. After leading LSU to victory in the 1944 Orange Bowl, he was selected by the Eagles with the fifth overall pick of the 1944 NFL draft. Van Buren acquired many nicknames over his career in reference to his running style, including &quot;Wham Bam&quot;, &quot;Moving Van&quot; and &quot;Supersonic Steve&quot;. He was the driving force for the Eagles in the team&#x27;s back-to-back NFL championships in 1948 and 1949; he scored the only touchdown of the 1948 NFL Championship Game against the Chicago Cardinals, and in the next year&#x27;s championship game against the Los Angeles Rams he set postseason records with 31 carries and 196 rushing yards.

After his playing career, Van Buren coached in minor league football, winning an Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL) championship with the Newark Bears in 1963. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965. Van Buren is a member of the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team, the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team and the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Considered one of the greatest players in Eagles franchise history, his number 15 jersey is retired by the team, and he is enshrined in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. For his college career, he was inducted into the Louisiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1944 and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in La Ceiba, Honduras, to an American father and a mother of Spanish heritage, Stephen Wood Van Buren was orphaned at age ten and was sent to live with relatives in New Orleans, Louisiana. There he attended Warren Easton High School, and tried out for the football team originally as a sophomore, but did not make it. Later that year he dropped out of high school and went to work in an iron foundry. He returned to high school two years later and made the team as an end his senior year. He played well enough that season to earn an athletic scholarship to Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge.

==College career==
Playing for the LSU Tigers football team, Van Buren was used primarily for blocking until his senior season, when head coach Bernie Moore moved him to tailback because of a lack of players due to World War II conscription. Van Buren received a class IV-F exemption due to an eye defect, so he was able to avoid conscription. &quot;He probably was the greatest running back in Southeastern Conference history,&quot; Moore recalled, &quot;and I used him as a blocking back until his last year. The folks in Baton Rouge never let me forget that.&quot;

He began the 1943 season by scoring four touchdowns in a 34–27 win over Georgia, including the game-winning touchdown with less than two minutes to play. His final college game was the 1944 Orange Bowl against Texas A&amp;M. Despite A&amp;M coach Homer Norton devising a game-plan specifically to stop him, Van Buren was responsible for all of his team&#x27;s points, as he ran for two touchdowns, threw for one more, and kicked LSU&#x27;s only successful extra point attempt in the 19–14 victory. He finished the season with 847 yards rushing and 16 touchdowns. He also completed 13 of 36 passing attempts for 160 yards. His 98 points scored (111 including the bowl game) led the nation. After the season, the Associated Press named Van Buren to its All-Southeastern Conference first team.

==Professional career==
While still enrolled at LSU, Van Buren was drafted into the National Football League by the Philadelphia Eagles with the fifth overall pick of the 1944 NFL draft. A month later, on May 19 he resigned from the university due to an eye infection that had been bothering him since the Orange Bowl game. The Eagles gave Van Buren a $4,000 contract with no signing bonus. But Van Buren, modest to a fault, took three weeks to sign the contract because he did not feel he was good enough to play professionally. He played as a running back and return specialist in the NFL for eight seasons, all of them with the Eagles. He spent the first seven of them under head coach Earle &quot;Greasy&quot; Neale, who dubbed Van Buren &quot;the best halfback in modern times.&quot;

===1944–1946: Kick return prowess===
Van Buren played in nine games during his first season with the Eagles, rushing for 444 yards as a running back and recording five interceptions on defense as a defensive back. His first NFL return touchdown came in the third game of the season, on a 55-yard punt return in the second quarter of a 38–0 shutout win against the Boston Yanks. Three games later, he returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown against the New York Giants, which was the longest kickoff return by any player that season. His 15.3 yards per punt return also led the league. Van Buren was named to the Associated Press&#x27;s All-Pro first team following the season, the only rookie so named for 1944.

In 1945, Van Buren led the NFL in rushing yards for the first time, and also led the league in scoring, yards from scrimmage, and kickoff return yards. He set an Eagles single-season record with 15 rushing touchdowns, a mark that stood until 2011. His 18 total touchdowns broke Don Hutson&#x27;s league record by one, set three seasons earlier. He again had the longest kickoff return of the season, this time with a 98-yard return touchdown against the Giants. In that game he also rushed for 100 yards and two more touchdowns as he scored all of the Eagles&#x27; touchdowns in the 28–21 loss. At least six major publications named him a first-team All-Pro for the season, including the Associated Press and United Press.

By 1946, Van Buren was considered one of the best players in the league. Before the season, he signed a three-year contract to remain with the Eagles, dispelling rumors that he planned to join the rival All-America Football Conference. He returned just five punts in the 1946 season, but ran one of them back 50 yards for a touchdown against the Boston Yanks in the final game of the year. It was the last punt Van Buren returned in his career. He finished the season with 529 rushing yards, third-most behind leader Bill Dudley of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rookie Pat Harder of the Chicago Cardinals. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and a second-team All-Pro by the United Press.

After the Eagles&#x27; loss to the Steelers during the 1946 season, Eagles coach Greasy Neale gave Dudley high praise during a conversation with Steelers coach Jock Sutherland. Sutherland then offered to trade Dudley to the Eagles. In return he wanted Van Buren, but according to Les Biederman of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot;, &quot;before [Sutherland] finished the second syllable of that name, Neale had fled the table.&quot;

===1947–1949: Three straight rushing titles===
Van Buren claimed his second rushing title in 1947, which was the first in a string of three straight. His 1,008 rushing yards broke the single-season record of 1,004 set by Beattie Feathers with the Chicago Bears in 1934. He was no longer returning punts for the team, as the role was taken over by halfback Bosh Pritchard, though he still returned kickoffs. His 95-yard kickoff return touchdown against the Washington Redskins in the first game of the season was again the longest kickoff return by any player that season, as well as the last kick return touchdown of his career.

The Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers both finished the 1947 regular season atop the Eastern Conference with an 8–4 record, so the two teams met for a tiebreaker game to determine the conference champion. During the week before the game, the Steelers ran workouts concentrating on a means of stopping Van Buren&#x27;s running. In the game, the Steelers&#x27; defensive line held Van Buren to 45 rushing yards and no rushing touchdowns, but he scored the game&#x27;s first touchdown on a 15-yard reception from quarterback Tommy Thompson. The Eagles won with a 21–0 shutout, setting them up to face the Chicago Cardinals in the NFL Championship Game, the first championship game appearance in franchise history, and it would be on Van Buren&#x27;s 27th birthday. Against the Cardinals&#x27; &quot;Million Dollar Backfield&quot;, Van Buren was held in check, as the Eagles were defeated 28–21 in a back-and-forth contest. Van Buren did score a touchdown, though, becoming the first player in NFL history to score a touchdown in a championship game on his birthday. This wouldn&#x27;t be repeated until Super Bowl LIX over 77 years later, when fellow Eagle Cooper DeJean intercepted Patrick Mahomes, and returned it for a 38-yard touchdown.

The 1948 season was the second straight that Van Buren led the league in carries, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and yards from scrimmage. In Week 3, in the first quarter against the New York Giants Van Buren scored his 39th career rushing touchdown, surpassing Ernie Nevers as the all-time leader. That game—a 45–0 shutout win—was the first in an eight-game winning streak for the Eagles in which they scored 275 points total and allowed 49. The team finished the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Division and were to meet the Chicago Cardinals again for the league championship.

====1948 NFL Championship Game====
Having posted similar offensive statistics in the regular season, the Eagles and Cardinals were expected to play a tight game. Played in a blizzard at Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park, the game&#x27;s only score was a fourth quarter rushing touchdown by Van Buren from five yards out. The 7–0 win gave the Eagles their first league title. Van Buren finished with 98 yards on 26 carries, though he nearly missed the game entirely. Thinking the game would not be played in the blizzard, he remained home until coach Greasy Neale called him and told him the game was still on. He had to catch three trolleys and walk six blocks in order to make the game on time. &quot;I looked out my bedroom window that morning, saw the snow and went back to bed,&quot; he later explained. &quot;I was sure the game would be postponed.&quot;
====1949: Career rushing title and second championship====
By 1949, Van Buren&#x27;s annual salary was $15,000. Despite the Eagles franchise struggling financially the previous season, Neale was willing to pay him more, but Van Buren declined. &quot;I could have gotten a good deal more,&quot; he said. &quot;But you acted a little different when your team lost money.&quot; He came into his sixth NFL season needing 104 rushing yards to break Clarke Hinkle&#x27;s career record of 3,860, which he set after ten seasons with the Packers. Van Buren passed Hinkle&#x27;s mark against the Detroit Lions in the second game of the season, and by the end of the year had broken his own single-season record as he rushed for 1,146 yards. He became the first running back in NFL history to achieve three consecutive rushing titles. Jim Brown twice, Earl Campbell, and Emmitt Smith have since managed the feat. The Eagles clinched the Eastern Division title in the tenth game of the season with a win over the Steelers. With Pittsburgh&#x27;s defense designed to stop him, Van Buren ran for 205 yards on 27 carries, setting an Eagles single-game franchise record for rushing yards that stood for over 60 years. The Eagles won their final two games and advanced to their third NFL championship game in as many seasons.

In the 1949 NFL Championship Game at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the Los Angeles Rams, as in the previous season&#x27;s game, Van Buren carried the Eagles&#x27; offense. Although he failed to score, he carried the ball 31 times for a championship game–record 196 yards on the heavily muddied field. The Eagles won 14–0, becoming the first—and as of 2024, the only—team in league history to win consecutive championship games with a shutout. Following the game, Rams coach Clark Shaughnessy called Van Buren one of the greatest ball carriers he had seen in forty years of football. &quot;He is equal to any player I&#x27;ve ever seen,&quot; said Shaughnessy. Van Buren was named the outstanding athlete of the year by the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.

===1950–1951: Injuries and retirement===
Back, leg, and neck injuries began to take a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team&#x27;s four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title for the first time in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year&#x27;s draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.

During training camp prior to the 1952 season, Van Buren tore a knee ligament and required surgery. He missed the entire season and retired as a player in September 1953, but remained on the Eagles payroll in a public relations capacity. He finished his career having carried 1,320 times for 5,860 yards and 69 touchdowns. He also scored three times returning kickoffs, three times on receptions, and twice on punt returns for a total of 77 touchdowns. On defense, he intercepted nine opponents&#x27; passes.

==NFL career statistics==
==Playing style==
Van Buren&#x27;s profile at the Pro Football Hall of Fame states he &quot;lined up as a halfback but played more like a fullback.&quot; He had a rare combination of strength, speed, and endurance. While not as elusive or nimble as other backs, he preferred to run through tacklers instead of avoid them, and never ran out of bounds if he felt he could pick up extra yards. &quot;There&#x27;s no trick,&quot; he said of his running style. &quot;When I see I&#x27;m gonna be tackled I just put my head down and give &#x27;em the shoulder.&quot; He was described as a &quot;deadly tackler&quot;, hitting as hard on defense as he did when he carried the ball. His disregard for his own body led to many injuries for both himself and opposing players.

He gained the majority of his yards and touchdowns on the ground, as he preferred being a runner rather than a receiver. All but three of his 69 offensive touchdowns were scored by rushing. Van Buren acquired many nicknames over his career. He was nicknamed &quot;Wham Bam&quot; for his quick and punishing running style. He was also referred to as &quot;Supersonic Steve,&quot; &quot;Blockbuster,&quot; and &quot;Moving Van.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Van Buren served as a coach for several seasons in minor league football after his playing career. After serving as a scout for the Eagles, he coached a minor league team in Bristol, Pennsylvania for three years. He then served as head coach for the Franklin Miners of Franklin, New Jersey and led them to a 27–5 win–loss record through 1958 and 1959. The Miners moved to Paterson, New Jersey and joined the Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL), winning the league&#x27;s championship in 1962. Van Buren then became head coach for the Newark Bears of the ACFL, which he led to a league championship in 1963. In 1965, the Bears franchise joined the Continental Football League, and in 1966 moved to Orlando, Florida and was renamed the Panthers. Van Buren was elevated to vice president and director of player personnel for the Panthers in 1966. He led the newly formed Hudson Valley Vikings of the North Atlantic Football League as head coach in 1967. In 1968, Van Buren became the offensive backfield coach for the Pottstown Firebirds of the ACFL. In 1969, he was the coach of the independent, semi-pro Jersey Senators, and in 1970, the Phoenix Steelers.

==Legacy, honors, and later life==

Van Buren retired as the NFL record holder for career rushing yards and career rushing touchdowns. He was the first player to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season twice, and he held the top two single-season records in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. He was the first to rush for over ten touchdowns in a season, a feat he accomplished three times before any other player did so once. He was the last Eagles player to win the rushing title until LeSean McCoy led the league in rushing yards in 2013. As of 2019, he remains the Eagles&#x27; career leader in rushing touchdowns.

In 1950, Van Buren was selected by the Associated Press for an all-time Southeastern Conference team, which honored the best 11 players in the conference&#x27;s then 17-year existence. He was inducted into the Louisiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1944 and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1961.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the class of 1965, which also included Guy Chamberlain, Paddy Driscoll, Dan Fortmann, Otto Graham, Sid Luckman, and Bob Waterfield. He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren&#x27;s acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I&#x27;m certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can&#x27;t hear too good and I&#x27;m not too good a speaker I won&#x27;t say much, but it&#x27;s a great honor to be here. The two days I&#x27;ve spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.

Van Buren&#x27;s jersey number 15 was later retired by the Eagles. He is also a member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was named to the Eagles 75th Anniversary Team as the starting running back. Van Buren is a member of the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team, which honors the best players from the decade. He was selected to the NFL&#x27;s 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams in 1994 and 2019, respectively.

In 2021 &quot;The Athletic&quot; listed him at 98 of the 100 greatest players ever.

Van Buren lived quietly in Lancaster, Pennsylvania after his football career, where he ran an antique shop with his son-in-law. He also owned a used-car lot with George Ferguson in Delaware County. He also owned a dance hall. His wife, Grace, died in 1978. Van Buren died of pneumonia on August 23, 2012, in Lancaster at the age of 91.

<text>Paul Smolensky (born May 5, 1955) is Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Cognitive Science at the Johns Hopkins University and a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond Washington.

Along with Alan Prince, in 1993 he developed Optimality Theory, a grammar formalism providing a formal theory of cross-linguistic typology (or Universal Grammar) within linguistics. 
Optimality Theory is popularly used for phonology, the subfield to which it was originally applied, but has been extended to other areas of linguistics such as syntax and semantics.

Smolensky is the recipient of the 2005 Rumelhart Prize for his development of the ICS Architecture, a model of cognition that aims to unify connectionism and symbolism, where the symbolic representations and operations are manifested as abstractions on the underlying connectionist or artificial neural networks. 
This architecture rests on Tensor Product Representations, compositional embeddings of symbolic structures in vector spaces. 
It encompasses the Harmonic Grammar framework, a connectionist-based numerical grammar formalism he developed with Géraldine Legendre and Yoshiro Miyata, which was the predecessor of Optimality Theory. 
The ICS Architecture builds on Harmony Theory, a formalism for artificial neural networks that introduced the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. 
This work, up through the early 2000s, is presented in the two-volume book written with Géraldine Legendre, &quot;The Harmonic Mind&quot;.
Subsequent work introduced &quot;Gradient Symbolic Computation&quot;, in which blends of partially-activated symbols occupy blends of positions in discrete structures such as trees or graphs. 
This has been successfully applied to numerous problems in theoretical linguistics where traditional discrete linguistic structures have proved inadequate, as well as incremental sentence processing in psycholinguistics.
In work with colleagues at Microsoft Research and Johns Hopkins, Gradient Symbolic Computation has been embedded in neural networks using deep learning to address a range of problems in reasoning and natural language processing.

Among his other important contributions is the notion of local conjunction of linguistic constraints, in which two constraints combine into a single stronger constraint that is violated only when both of its conjuncts are violated within the same specified local domain. Local conjunction has been applied to the analysis of various &quot;super-additive&quot; effects in Optimality Theory. With Bruce Tesar (Rutgers University), Smolensky has also contributed significantly to the study of the learnability of Optimality Theoretic grammars (in the sense of computational learning theory).

Smolensky was a founding member of the Parallel Distributed Processing research group at the University of California, San Diego, and is currently a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University and of the Deep Learning Group at Microsoft Research, Redmond Washington.

<doc id="1214107" wikidata="Q266681" url="?curid=1214107" title="BMC ADO17">
<text>BMC ADO17 is the model code used by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) for a range of front wheel drive cars in the European &#x27;D&#x27; market-segment of larger family cars, manufactured from September 1964 to 1975. The car was initially sold under the Austin marque as the Austin 1800, then by Morris as the Morris 1800, and by Wolseley as the Wolseley 18/85. Later, it was marketed with a 2.2 L engine as the Austin 2200, Morris 2200 and Wolseley Six. Informally, because of the car&#x27;s exceptional width and overall appearance, these cars became widely known under the nickname &quot;landcrab&quot;

The 1800 was voted European Car of the Year for 1965.

==Development==
===Mark I===
The Austin 1800 was developed at BMC as a larger follow-up to the successful Mini and Austin 1100 under the ADO17 codename, ADO being an abbreviation for Austin Drawing Office. Additional badge-engineered Morris 1800 and Wolseley 18/85 variants were launched in 1966 and 1967 respectively, catering for the BMC dealerships selling those marques. The 18/85 name had previously been used on the Wolseley 18/85 of 1938 to 1948.

The car was unconventional in its appearance in 1964, with its large glasshouse and spacious, minimalist interior including leather, wood, and chrome features plus an unusual instrument display with ribbon speedometer and green indicator light on the end of the indicator stalk. There was a chrome &quot;umbrella handle&quot; handbrake under the dashboard parcel shelf, and the two front seats met in the middle and could be used, on occasion, as a bench seat. Both Alec Issigonis and Pininfarina worked on its exterior. The car&#x27;s technical internals were also unconventional and ahead of their time, including Hydrolastic suspension, and the application of inertia-controlled brake-force distribution, by means of a valve which transferred braking force between front and rear axles, as a function of sensed deceleration rather than as a function of fluid pressure. An interesting feature was a tail/brake/indicator night dipping system. A resistance circuit was connected in such a way so that when the sidelight circuit was energised, the resistors dimmed the tail/brake/indicator lights so not to blind or dazzle following drivers. The unitary bodyshell was exceptionally stiff, with a torsional rigidity of 18,032 Nm/degree.

Progressive improvement was a feature of most cars in this period, but the number and nature of the changes affecting the early years of the Austin 1800 looked to some as though the car had been introduced with insufficient development. In December 1964, a month after its launch, reclining front seats and the option of an arm rest in the middle of the back seat were added to the specification schedule. A month later, in January 1965, the final drive ratio reverted to the 3.88:1 value used in the prototype, from the 4.2:1 ratio applied at launch: this was described as a response to &quot;oil-consumption problems&quot;. The same month also saw the indicator switch modified. At the same time, higher gearing and reduced valve clearances reduced the published power output by , but cured the &quot;valve-crash&quot; reported by some buyers when approaching top speed on one of Britain&#x27;s recently constructed motorways. The manufacturer quietly replaced the &quot;flexible, flat-section dipstick&quot; which, it was said, had caused inattentive owners to overfill the sump after inserting the dipstick back-to-front so that the word &quot;Oil&quot; could not be seen on it.

Subsequent modifications included changing, repositioning and re-angling the handbrake in October 1965, removing the rear anti-roll bar and rearranging the rear suspension at the end of 1965, at the same time adjusting the steering to fix a problem of tyre scuffing, and fitting stronger engine side covers in January 1966, along with modified engine-mounting rubbers which were &quot;resistant to de-bonding&quot;. February 1965 saw water shields fitted to the rear hubs, and the car&#x27;s steering rattle cured by the judicious fitting of a spacer, while the propensity of early cars to jump out of first and second gears was solved by the fitting of a &quot;synchroniser&quot;.

Further improvements followed the launch of the Morris 1800 early in 1966. Gear cables were revamped to deal with &quot;difficult engagement&quot; of first and third gears in cold weather, and the seat mountings were adapted to increase rake in May 1966.

In June 1967, without any fanfare or press releases, a modified version of the 1800 began to arrive at dealers, with repositioned heater controls, a strip of &quot;walnut veneer&quot; on the fascia, and separate bucket seats replacing the former split bench seat at the front. Other criticisms seem to have been quietly dealt with at the same time, including the fitting of more highly geared steering, which needed only 3.75 rather than 4.2 turns between locks, although the modification had applied to cars produced since September 1966 and, in the case of Australian cars, some time before that.

This was also the point at which the car received a differently calibrated dipstick, giving rise to rumours that engine problems on some of the early models had resulted from nothing more complicated than the wrong calibration of the dipstick, causing the cars to run with the wrong level of engine oil. The manufacturer insisted that the &quot;recalibration&quot; of the dipstick was one of several (unspecified) modifications, and urged owners not to use the new dipsticks with older engines.

A nickname of &#x27;Landcrab&#x27; was given to the car by some car enthusiasts, derived from the car&#x27;s unusual proportions, being much wider and lower than most other cars in its class. The car&#x27;s successful use in endurance rallies came about because, while the car was never particularly fast, its strong bodyshell and sophisticated suspension allowed it to reliably maintain competitive average speeds over long distances on poor roads. The car&#x27;s stance, strength and slow-but-sure nature over rough ground put the BMC rally crews in mind of a terrestrial crab. The nickname stuck and became widespread in the press and public.

The ADO17&#x27;s doors were later also used on the Austin Maxi and larger Austin 3-Litre models, as well as on the Panther De Ville.

===Mark II===
In May 1968, a Mark II version was launched. This featured a cheaper and more conventional interior, revised front grilles and other trim, and for the Austin and Morris models the slim, horizontal rear lights were replaced by vertical &quot;fin&quot; lights which gave a family look along with the smaller ADO16 range. The Wolseley retained its unique rear lights. Other changes included a higher second gear and final drive ratio for the manual transmission, and conventional suspension bushes replaced the far superior roller bearings fitted to the Mark I. The compression ratio was increased and maximum power output boosted by 5 bhp to a claimed 86 bhp. The Mark II also had larger wheels.

In 1969, the sills and doors from the 1800 (with Mark II exterior handles) were used on the bodyshell of the otherwise new Austin Maxi; apart from that, both models have little interchangeability.

The 1800S twin carburettor 95 bhp engine came in from October 1968. By 1970, a &quot;S&quot; model with twin SU HS6 carburettors, a 120 mph speedometer and sporty-looking badging was available.
===Mark III===
Further, less dramatic modifications heralded a Mark III version in 1972. This had another change to the front grille (now a shared style for the Austin and Morris) and interior improvements, including a conventional floor-mounted handbrake. At this point, six-cylinder versions were introduced – the Austin 2200, Morris 2200 and Wolseley Six. While 1800 versions of the Austin and Morris were continued, the Wolseley 18/85 was dropped.

==Home-market 6-cylinder models==
The 2.2-litre straight-six engine used in the Australian Austin Tasman &amp; Kimberley &quot;X6&quot; cars was introduced into the British ADO17 range in 1972. The British 6-cylinder models were marketed as the Austin 2200, Morris 2200 and Wolseley Six.

The ubiquitous doors even appeared on the further upmarket Austin 3-Litre of 1968 and, at prototype stage, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces.

==Sales==
Some 386,000 examples of all variants were produced in just over a decade, with the Austin-badged versions being the most common; some 221,000 units were produced. There were 95,271 Morris 1800 and 35,597 Wolseley 18/85 produced in the UK. Relatively few have survived outside the hands of enthusiasts owing to its original unfashionable image, and more recently, its popularity in the demolition derby and banger racing scenes, owing to the bodyshell&#x27;s exceptional strength and rigidity.

In early 1975, all three models were replaced by the wedge-shaped ADO71, or 18–22 series, which bore the Austin and Morris (1800 and 2200) names, while the Wolseley variant had no official model name save for being marketed as &quot;the Wolseley saloon&quot;. From late 1975, all ADO71 models were marketed under the Princess name and the Wolseley marque was discontinued.
==Motorsport==

The model proved a strong competitor in endurance rallying, finishing second in the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon and achieving three of the top 20 positions in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally. In later life, the ADO17 became a popular car for competing in banger racing and in demolition derbies, owing to the bodyshell&#x27;s strength, which made it ideal for those sports.
==Australia==

===Austin 1800===


By 1966, Australia was described as BMC&#x27;s leading world market. The 1800 was introduced in Australia in November 1965 as the Austin 1800, with a Mark II version being introduced in 1968. Australian-produced vehicles started out with a claimed local content of 65–70%, along with an undertaking from the manufacturers to raise the level to 95% in line with government requirements by the end of 1968. Initially the cars were generally identical to their British contemporaries; however, the local production was quickly modified to suit the harsher roads and climate of Australia. Modifications to the British Mark I design included raised suspension trim height, the provision of a large, heavy sump guard, and better sealing against dust. The Australian Mark II was notable in retaining the lower final drive ratio of the Mark I&#x27;s manual transmission (but not the lower second gear), and, with the exception of the initial production run, was fitted with a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system manufactured locally by Paton&#x27;s Brake Replacements (PBR) Pty. Ltd. Despite offering the safety of a dual-circuit system, it was generally held to be inferior in performance to the earlier Girling equipment. The Australian Mark II was also originally fitted with an alternator manufactured locally by Electricity Meter &amp; Allied Industries Limited (EMAIL), a company better known for its kilowatt-hour meters and household appliances. In the event of failure, most EMAIL alternators were replaced by Australian-made Lucas units.

A version unique to Australia was the Austin 1800 Utility, a coupe utility produced from 1968 to 1971. Over 2,000 examples were built. The Utility was released near the end of the first series in July 1968 and most of the examples produced were therefore Mk IIs. A cab chassis variant was also offered. The 1800 Utility was given the model code YDO10.

Per capita, the Australian model sold better than anywhere else in the world. Ironically, it represented the tail-end of the popularity of British-designed cars in Australia. In the Australian market, it offered a roomy and advanced 4-cylinder alternative to the popular 6-cylinder models such as the Holden Kingswood, which used conventional engineering based on American principles. Some versions badged BMC Freeway (a name previously used for a six-cylinder Farina model in Australia) were exported to New Zealand, which also assembled UK-made Austin and Morris 1800s in separate plants.

As a one-off engineering prototype, to test production viability, an Australian 1800 Mark II body with subtly extended front guards and modified front internal structure was fitted with an early Rover 3.5 litre V8 mounted in the &quot;North-South&quot; position in the engine bay and then through a complex mechanical system, drove a heavily modified version of an &quot;East-West&quot;-mounted Borg Warner 3-speed automatic gearbox and Austin FWD differential. This car became Australia’s first locally-made FWD V8 car. The car was built by BLMC (Australia) at its Victoria Park works at Zetland, New South Wales. Mass production costs and general viability of the V8 &quot;1800&quot; were felt to be excessive, and the project was shelved, preference being given to the Australian Leyland P76 project. Some reports state that the vehicle was eventually shipped to British Leyland in the UK and never seen again, while others claim it was simply broken up at the end of its testing by Leyland Australia.

===Austin X6 Tasman &amp; Kimberley===

In 1970, the Australian subsidiary of BL replaced the 1800 with the modified and facelifted &quot;X6&quot; models known as the Austin Tasman and the more upmarket Austin Kimberley. These cars featured new front and rear styling and a 2.2-litre 6-cylinder version of the E series OHC four-cylinder engine (becoming one of the first front-wheel-drive cars with a transversely mounted &quot;inline&quot; six-cylinder engine). Both models had an updated dashboard and interior but retained the &quot;bus&quot;-like steering wheel position and gearshift approach from the 1800. The MkI Kimberly had a higher power engine fitted with twin SU carburettors (MkII’s reverted to single carburettors like the Tasman). The X6 series was intended to compete more effectively with the Australian-assembled rear-wheel drive six-cylinder family cars of GM Holden, Ford and Chrysler Australia. Both of the Austin cars were offered with either 4-speed manuals or a 3-speed automatic. Mark II versions of both X6 models were introduced in 1971.

The X6 Tasman and Kimberley models were given a model designation code of YDO13 with the Mark II models coded YDO19.

Despite their technical superiority, updated styling, good ride, comfort, interior space and adequate power the &quot;X6&quot; series were somewhat underdeveloped due to a limited budget and so became ultimately commercially inferior to their competitors – eventually being superseded by the Leyland P76 in 1973.

Local distributor New Zealand Motor Corporation initially imported the Australian Tasman and Kimberley models from Zetland, but later assembled most of its stock from CKD kits at its Petone plant near Wellington. The Kiwi cars had different interior trim materials as part of the 40-50% local parts content common at the time but otherwise differed only in detail from Australian made cars. They were, however, sold as Morris models instead of Austin.

The Australian-developed 2.2 E6 was also used in UK-built 2200 models

Eventually, by 1973, Leyland Australia had modified the L6 engine and extended the stroke of the 2200 motor to 2600 cc for final use in the Leyland P76 and L6 Marina models.


==BMC 1800 Aerodinamica==
In 1967 Pininfarina unveiled at the Turin Motor Show a concept car based on the Landcrab and designed by Paolo Martin, called the BMC 1800 Aerodinamica. The sleek design previewed the Citroen CX by some seven years. The car was evaluated by BMC, and Pininfarina developed a further smaller model based on the BMC ADO16 model, but the design was not taken up by the then merged British Leyland. This was after BMC had investigated a Mini shaped version. The 1800 version was however used by chief engineer Harry Webster and was known within the Austin Morris division as the Yellow Peril.

<doc id="1214115" wikidata="Q245651" url="?curid=1214115" title="Treat Her Right">
<text>Treat Her Right was an American rock group, formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, in 1985. The band originally featured Mark Sandman on &quot;low guitar&quot;, Billy Conway on cocktail drum, David Champagne on guitar and Jim Fitting on harmonica. Singing and songwriting duties were shared by all but Conway. Champagne and Fitting reformed the band in 2009 with new members Steve Mayone and Billy Beard.

Treat Her Right was the forerunner to the successful indie rock band Morphine. Critic Ira Robbins described Treat Her Right as &quot;[n]ot quite a blues band, not exactly swamp trash and too stylized for basic rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot; &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; later used the label &quot;punk-blues&quot; to describe the band. However, &quot;punk&quot; was not a characteristic associated with the band while it was active.

Sandman stated the band&#x27;s aesthetic: &quot;Keep it simple at all costs. Resist the temptation to add. If you&#x27;re going to do something to a song, subtract.&quot;

==History==
===Career (1985–1991)===
The band derived its name from the 1965 international smash hit by Roy Head and the Traits, &quot;Treat Her Right.&quot; Their instrumentation was unusual, with Sandman&#x27;s &quot;low guitar&quot; mimicking a bass guitar and Conway eschewing a full drum kit. Conway later observed, &quot;When we started that band, one of the parameters was that everyone had to be able to carry their equipment into the gig in one trip. We wanted to keep things small and simple.&quot;

From the beginning, the band espoused a &quot;back to basics&quot; approach. Champagne said the idea was to start with the same building materials as the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin, but to come up with something of their own. A key factor was leaving much space in the music, which came about by circumstances as well as design. Soon after forming, the band got a gig at The Plough and Stars, a small bar in Cambridge whose owner wouldn&#x27;t let them bring in drums, so Conway played a railing and stamped a trap door to the kitchen. Not long afterward, he acquired the cocktail drum. They intentionally wanted not to have a big kick-snare drum, which at the time was pervasive in rock music production.

The group&#x27;s self-financed and self-titled debut was released on a small Boston record label in 1986 before being issued in the UK by Demon Records. The group signed to RCA Records, which reissued the debut in the United States. Their first recording attempt was a modest success – Champagne&#x27;s &quot;I Got a Gun&quot; and Sandman&#x27;s cover of James Blood Ulmer&#x27;s &quot;Where Did All the Girls Come From?&quot; received some play on college radio. &quot;I Think She Likes Me&quot; describes Sandman&#x27;s experience in a Fairplay, Colorado bar where a woman came on to him. Critic John Dougan described the debut as &quot;slick, intelligent, sly, and well worth your while.&quot;

&quot;Tied to the Tracks&quot; was issued in 1989. Sales did not meet RCA&#x27;s expectations. In the notes for their third record, the group wrote, &quot;RCA decided that if our little basement tape could do so well, why not spend fifty times more money and it will be fifty times better! (They think everything works like that.)&quot; Treat Her Right were dropped from their RCA contract.

&quot;What&#x27;s Good for You&quot;, their third album, was issued on Rounder Records in 1991. The ragged, live-in-the-studio sound was partly inspired by the model established by Chess Records, which had released many classic blues and early rock and roll records. Shortly after this third release, Treat Her Right disbanded.

===Other projects and post-breakup===
Fitting later played with The The, The Coots and Session Americana. Champagne remained musically active, playing with groups such as The Jazz Popes. Sandman formed Morphine in 1989, which Conway joined in 1993. Although more blues-based than Morphine, Treat Her Right sowed the seeds of Sandman&#x27;s later sound with its unusual instrumentation (Sandman&#x27;s guitar with Treat Her Right was a three string custom model, making it sound more like a bass guitar) and slightly dark focus, most evident on the Sandman-penned songs.

Sandman died of a heart attack while onstage with Morphine in Italy in 1999. In 2004, &quot;&quot; was released. The 2-CD/1-DVD compilation was culled from Sandman&#x27;s personal archive. It included several Treat Her Right songs, although for some unknown reason, Jim Fitting&#x27;s name did not appear in the credits.

===Reformation (2009–2011)===
The Treat Her Right song &quot;Rhythm &amp; Booze&quot; was featured on &quot;The Hangover&quot; soundtrack, released in 2009. That same year, &quot;The Lost Album&quot;, a record of unreleased Treat Her Right material, was released by Hi-n-Dry. Shortly thereafter, Treat Her Right reunited to mark the ten-year anniversary of Sandman&#x27;s death at the Mark Sandman Memorial Concert in September, and the band continued activity. Champagne and Fitting led the new version of Treat Her Right, joined by Steve Mayone playing low guitar and Billy Beard (previously of the Boston new wave band Face to Face) playing drums. This incarnation of the band played some gigs in the Boston area, of which the latest appears to have been in 2011. Fitting then devoted his efforts to Session Americana, which had become more active again.

=== Billy, Jimmy, &amp; Dave (2019–20)===
In 2019, Conway, Fitting, and Champagne recorded an album. A live date was announced for January 19, 2020 at Club Passim in Cambridge -- their first appearance together on stage since all were members of Treat Her Right. Conway was unable to participate due to health issues, with Larry Dersch and Jerome Deupree filling in on drums. Fitting told the audience Conway had recently restarted cancer treatment.
