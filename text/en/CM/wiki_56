<text>Deborah Clare Bull, Baroness Bull, (born 22 March 1963), is an English dancer, writer, and broadcaster, and former creative director of the Royal Opera House. She joined King&#x27;s College London as Director, Cultural Partnerships in 2012. In 2015 she was appointed as the university&#x27;s Assistant Principal (London), in 2018 was named Vice President &amp; Vice-Principal (London) and in 2021 named Vice Principal (Communities &amp; National Engagement) until her departure in July 2022.

== Early life ==
Born in Derby, and brought up in Kent and Lincolnshire, she studied dance from the age of seven, first locally, and then at the Royal Ballet School. Whilst at the school she won the 1980 Prix de Lausanne, the prestigious international ballet competition.

== Ballet career ==
She was invited to join The Royal Ballet in 1981, having toured with the company as a student during the summer. The teachers that Bull identified as the &quot;resident teachers&quot; were Brian Shaw, Alexander Agadzhanov, Betty Anderton and the Norwegian Gerd Larsen. Bull particularly admired Larsen&#x27;s ability to introduce mime. Bull gained principal status in 1992, after the company&#x27;s opening performance in Japan at which she danced the role of Gamzatti in &quot;La Bayadère&quot;.

During her 20 years in the Royal Ballet, she danced a wide range of work throughout the repertoire. Her leading roles in the classics included Odette/Odile in &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, Aurora in &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and Kitri in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and she created roles for Ashley Page, David Bintley, Michael Corder, Emma Diamond, Wayne McGregor, Glen Tetley and Twyla Tharp. She received particular praise for her performances in the works of George Balanchine and William Forsythe. In 1995, Forsythe staged for her the first performance in the UK of his ballet &quot;Steptext&quot;, and she was subsequently nominated for a 1996 Olivier Award in the &#x27;Outstanding Achievement in Dance&#x27; Category for her interpretation. She was named as 1996 Dancer of the Year by both &quot;The Sunday Express&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, who praised her work on and off the stage, saying &#x27;here is a dancer whose intelligence and courage – for once – don&#x27;t reside entirely in the tips of her toes&#x27;.

Away from the Royal Ballet, she toured Italy, North America and Canada with Wayne Eagling&#x27;s group, &#x27;Stars of the Royal Ballet&#x27;, and was invited to join Irek Mukhamedov for the debut performances of his company &#x27;Irek Mukhamedov and Friends&#x27; in 1992. She danced at the 1993 and 1995 Harrogate International Festival, and in April 1996 was invited to perform in the first &#x27;Diamonds of World Ballet&#x27; Gala at the Kremlin Palace, Moscow. She toured Japan with Tetsuya Kumakawa and in the summers of 1994 and 1995 she organised, staged and starred in &quot;An Evening of British Ballet&quot; at the Sintra Festival in Portugal. In March 2001, she was invited to star in the triple bill Nijinsky Ritrovato at the Rome Opera House, dancing the Chosen Maiden in &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; and alongside Carla Fracci in &quot;Jeux&quot;.

== Artists&#x27; Development Initiative ==
In addition to her work with the Royal Ballet, she founded in 1998 the Artists&#x27; Development Initiative at the Royal Opera House, a programme designed to open up the resources and expertise within the theatre to small-scale companies and independent artists. Over its first two years, ADI worked with over 250 artists from outside the Royal Opera House and facilitated collaborations across art forms and between independent choreographers and classical dancers. ADI shared the 2001 &quot;Time Out&quot; Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance with Wayne McGregor for Symbiont(s), premiered in the Clore Studio Upstairs in June 2000.

== ROH2 ==
Bull retired from The Royal Ballet in August 2001 to take up a new position at the Royal Opera House in January 2002, as Creative Director, ROH2, developing a range of small-scale and experimental artistic initiatives and overseeing the programme in the theatre&#x27;s alternative performance spaces. In 2004, her remit expanded to include the delivery of a strategy for the ROH&#x27;s work away from the main stage, including an alternative performance programme, opera and dance development initiatives, big screen live relays from the main stage, an &#x27;On the Road&#x27; programme and daytime activities in the building. In addition, she managed ROH Collections, the Royal Opera House&#x27;s extensive archives, and was focused on the organisation&#x27;s Olympic planning and audience engagement strategies. In 2008, she was made Creative Director of the Royal Opera House, a post she held until 2012.

== Publishing ==
In addition to her work as a dancer, she has regularly written and lectured on the arts. In January 1996 she debated at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion &#x27;This House Believes the National Lottery Gives Too Much Money to the Elitist Arts&#x27;. Her address was described by Lord Gowrie, her debating partner, as &#x27;the best speech I have heard on the Arts in 30 years&#x27;. The motion was heavily defeated, a triumph which the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; attributed largely to &#x27;the eloquence of a ballerina, unaccustomed to public speaking&#x27;, describing her speech as &#x27;cogently argued and delivered with generosity of spirit&#x27;.

In October 1996 she was invited by Lord Gowrie to deliver the Arts Council Annual Lecture at the Royal Society for the Arts, &#x27;From Private Patronage to Public Purse&#x27;.

She has written articles for &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Classic FM Magazine&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and reviewed for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Literary Review&quot; and several dance magazines. From 1999 to 2001 she wrote a regular column, Private View, for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;.

Aside from the Arts, she has a passionate interest in health and fitness, and has taught nutrition to the students of the Royal Ballet School as well as chairing the Prix de Lausanne&#x27;s annual seminars on dance related health matters.

She has published three books. &quot;The Vitality Plan&quot;, (Dorling Kindersley, January 1998) was published simultaneously in the United States as &quot;Totally Fit&quot;, and has since been translated into seven languages. &quot;Dancing Away&quot; (Methuen, October 1998) is a diary of The Royal Ballet&#x27;s first year &#x27;on the road&#x27;, as the Royal Opera House underwent its extensive and controversial redevelopment. To mark publication, Deborah was commissioned to read five extracts from the book on BBC Radio 4. &quot;Dancing Away&quot; was described by &quot;The Spectator&quot; as &#x27;arguably the most amusing and fascinating dance book ever published&#x27;. &quot;The Faber Pocket Guide to Ballet&quot;, jointly with Luke Jennings, was published in 2004, describing important historical and repertoire ballets, with a &#x27;View from the Wings&#x27; by Bull of her personal thoughts on dancing in a piece. A second book for Faber&quot;, The Everyday Dancer&quot;, appeared in 2011.

==Broadcasting career==
===Television===
Bull&#x27;s first programme for television, &quot;Dance Ballerina, Dance&quot;, was screened at Christmas 1998 as part of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Dance Night&quot;, an evening devoted entirely to dance which she co-presented along with the comedian Alexei Sayle. &quot;Travels with My Tutu&quot;, written and presented by Bull, was screened over Christmas 2000. This four-part BBC2 series explored breakdance, jive, belly dance and tango and attracted record audiences.

She has presented live on BBC Two from the Royal Opera House (&quot;Coppélia&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, both in 2000) and from Sadler&#x27;s Wells (Rambert Dance Company), as well as a live Proms performance on BBC One in 2004. In June 2001, she presented the Eurovision Young Dancers 2001 competition from the Linbury Studio Theatre, broadcast to 18 European nations as well as on BBC2 and BBC Knowledge. She was also the UK&#x27;s commentator for the contest in , and . Her three part, award-winning series for BBC2, &quot;The Dancer&#x27;s Body&quot;, was screened in September and October 2002.

In March 2017, Bull was one of the judges who decided which of the finalists in the ballet category of the &quot;BBC Young Dancer 2017&quot; competition would progress to the overall final.

===Radio===
She has made programmes for, and contributes regularly to, BBC Radio 4 including &quot;Dancing Away&quot; (1998), &quot;Leaving Barons Court&quot; (1999), &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; (2001) and &quot;Law in Order&quot; (2002), &quot;A Dance Through Time&quot; (2004), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2008) and &quot;Hothouse Kids&quot; (2009). She presented &quot;Sounds of Dance&quot;, a four-part series for BBC Radio 3 from December 2003 to January 2004.

In 2012, Bull presented the five-part BBC Radio 4 series, &quot;Dance Nation&quot;, on English dance. She was the castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in May the following year.

She was a judge for the 2010 Man Booker Prize.

In December 2011, it was announced that Bull had been appointed the first Executive Director of King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s King&#x27;s Cultural Institute, and would be taking up the role in March 2012.

In April 2024, Bull was appointed as non-executive director of the UK research funding agency, UKRI.

<doc id="1212038" wikidata="Q157678" url="?curid=1212038" title="Operation Gladio">
<text>Operation Gladio was the codename for clandestine &quot;stay-behind&quot; operations of armed resistance that were organized by the Western Union (WU) (founded in 1948), and subsequently by NATO (formed in 1949) and by the CIA (established in 1947), in collaboration with several European intelligence agencies during the Cold War. Although &quot;Gladio&quot; specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, &quot;Operation Gladio&quot; is used as an informal name for all of them. Stay-behind operations were prepared in many NATO member countries, and in some neutral countries.

According to several Western European researchers, the operation involved the use of assassination, psychological warfare, and false flag operations to delegitimize left-wing parties in Western European countries, and even went so far as to support anti-communist militias and right-wing terrorism as they tortured communists and assassinated them, such as Eduardo Mondlane in 1969. The United States Department of State rejected the view that they supported terrorists and maintains that the operation served only to resist a potential invasion of Western European countries by the Soviet Union.

== History and general stay-behind structure ==
=== British experience during World War II ===
Following the fall of France in 1940, Winston Churchill created the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to both assist resistance movements and carry out sabotage and subversive operations in occupied Europe. It was revealed half a century later that SOE was complemented by a stay-behind organisation in Britain, created in extreme secrecy, to prepare for a possible invasion by Nazi Germany.

A network of resistance fighters was formed across Britain and arms caches were established. The network was recruited, in part, from the 5th (Ski) Battalion of the Scots Guards (which had originally been formed, but was not deployed, to fight alongside Finnish forces fighting the Soviet invasion of Finland). The network, which became known as the Auxiliary Units, was headed by Major Colin Gubbins – an expert in guerrilla warfare (who would later lead SOE). The units were trained, in part, by &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Calvert, a Royal Engineers officer who specialised in demolition by explosives and covert raiding operations. To the extent that they were publicly visible, the Auxiliary Units were disguised as Home Guard units, under GHQ Home Forces. The network was allegedly disbanded in 1944; some of its members subsequently joined the Special Air Service and saw action in North-West Europe.

While David Lampe published a book on the Auxiliary Units in 1968, their existence did not become widely known by the public until reporters such as David Pallister of &quot;The Guardian&quot; revived interest in them during the 1990s.

=== Post-war creation ===
After World War II, the UK and the US decided to create &quot;stay-behind&quot; paramilitary organizations, with the official aim of countering a possible Soviet invasion through sabotage and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. Arms caches were hidden, escape routes prepared, and loyal members recruited, whether in Italy or in other European countries. Its clandestine &quot;cells&quot; were to stay behind in enemy-controlled territory and to act as resistance movements, conducting sabotage, guerrilla warfare and assassinations.

Clandestine stay-behind (SB) units were created with the experience and involvement of former SOE officers. Following Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s October 1990 revelations, General Sir John Hackett, former commander-in-chief of the British Army on the Rhine, declared on November 16, 1990, that a contingency plan involving &quot;stay behind and resistance in depth&quot; was drawn up after the war. The same week, Anthony Farrar-Hockley, former commander-in-chief of NATO&#x27;s Forces in Northern Europe from 1979 to 1982, declared to &quot;The Guardian&quot; that a secret arms network was established in Britain after the war. Hackett had written in 1978 a novel, &quot;The Third World War: August 1985&quot;, which was a fictionalized scenario of a Soviet Army invasion of West Germany in 1985. The novel was followed in 1982 by &quot;The Third World War: The Untold Story&quot;, which elaborated on the original. Farrar-Hockley had aroused controversy in 1983 when he became involved in trying to organise a campaign for a new Home Guard against a potential Soviet invasion.

NATO provided a forum to integrate, coordinate, and optimise the use of all SB assets as part of the Emergency War Plan. This coordination included the military SB units, which were part of NATO&#x27;s order of battle, and the clandestine SBOs run by NATO nations. Western secret services had cooperated in various bilateral, triparty, and multilateral fora in the creation, training, and running of clandestine Stay-behind organisations (SBO) soon after World War II. In 1947, France, the United Kingdom, and the Benelux countries had created a joint policy on SB in the Western Union Clandestine Committee (WUCC), a forum of the Western Union, the European defence alliance predating NATO. The format entered into NATO structures around 1951–1952 when the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR) established such an &#x27;ad hoc&#x27; committee, the Clandestine Planning Committee (CPC) at SHAPE. The peacetime role of the CPC would have been to coordinate the different military and paramilitary plans and programmes in NATO nations (and partners like Switzerland and Austria) in order to avoid duplication of effort. The CPC itself had at least two working groups – one on communications and one on networks. SACEUR also established a Special Projects Branch to develop and coordinate &#x27;clandestine forces operating in support of SACEUR&#x27;s military forces&#x27;.

In 1957, the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Benelux countries, all of which ran SBOs in Western Europe, established the &#x27;Six Powers Lines Committee&#x27; which became the Allied Clandestine Committee in 1958 and, after 1976, the Allied Coordination Committee (ACC). The ACC has been described as a technical committee to bring national SBOs together. It took its guidance from the CPC and organized multinational exercises. The authority of SACEUR when it came to clandestine operations was discussed in the early 1950s as one can gather from the document &#x27;SHAPE Problems Outstanding with the Standing Group&#x27;, which, under sub-heading &#x27;IV. Special Plans&#x27; calls for the &#x27;Delineation of Responsibilities of the Clandestine Services and of SACEUR on Clandestine Matters Including Pertinent Definitions and Organizations&#x27; and &#x27;Principles for Unorthodox Warfare Planning&#x27;. While all this concerned the highest level of NATO command, coordination in time of crisis had to be arranged. Thus, to coordinate these activities at different command levels in wartime, SACEUR created the Allied Clandestine Coordinating Groups (ACCG) staffed with personnel from NATO nations at SHAPE and the subordinate commands. In case of war, SACEUR was meant to exercise operational control of national clandestine services&#x27; assets, according to each nation&#x27;s existing policies, through the ACCG. By 1961 though, &#x27;both SHAPE and CPC [now] accepted that such SB activity [guerrilla warfare and resistance under Soviet occupation] was a purely national responsibility&#x27;.

Upon learning of the discovery, the parliament of the European Union (EU) drafted a resolution sharply criticizing the fact. Yet only Italy, Belgium and Switzerland carried out parliamentary investigations, while the administration of President George H. W. Bush refused to comment.

NATO&#x27;s &quot;stay-behind&quot; organizations were never called upon to resist a Soviet invasion. According to a November 13, 1990, Reuters cable, &quot;André Moyen – a former member of the Belgian military security service and of the [stay-behind] network – said Gladio was not just anti-Communist but was for fighting subversion in general. He added that his predecessor had given Gladio 142 million francs ($4.6 million) to buy new radio equipment.&quot;

== Operations in NATO countries ==
=== Italy ===
The Italian NATO stay-behind organization, dubbed &quot;Gladio&quot;, was set up under Minister of Defense (from 1953 to 1958) Paolo Taviani&#x27;s (DC) supervision. Gladio&#x27;s existence came to public knowledge when Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti revealed it to the Chamber of Deputies on 24 October 1990, although far-right terrorist Vincenzo Vinciguerra had already revealed its existence during his 1984 trial. According to media analyst Edward S. Herman, &quot;both the President of Italy, Francesco Cossiga, and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, had been involved in the Gladio organization and coverup ...&quot;

Researcher Francesco Cacciatore, in an article based on recently de-classified documents, writes that a &quot;note from March 1972 specified that the possibility of using &#x27;Gladio&#x27; in the event of internal subversions, not provided for by the organization&#x27;s statute and not supported by NATO directives or plans, was outside the scope of the original stay-behind and, therefore, &#x27;never to be considered among the purposes of the operation&#x27;. The pressure put forward by the Americans during the 1960s to use &#x27;Gladio&#x27; for purposes other than those of a stay-behind network would appear to have failed in the long term.&quot;

According to the former Italian Ministry of Grace and Justice Claudio Martelli, during the 1980s and 1990s Andreotti was the political reference of Licio Gelli and the Masonic lodge Propaganda 2.

==== Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s revelations on 24 October 1990 ====
Christian Democrat Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti publicly recognized the existence of Gladio on 24 October 1990. Andreotti spoke of a &quot;structure of information, response and safeguard&quot;, with arms caches and reserve officers. He gave to the &quot;Commissione Stragi&quot; a list of 622 civilians who according to him were part of Gladio. Andreotti also stated that 127 weapons caches had been dismantled, and said that Gladio had not been involved in any of the bombings committed from the 1960s to the 1980s.

Andreotti declared that the Italian military services (predecessors of the SISMI) had joined in 1964 the Allied Clandestine Committee created in 1957 by the US, France, Belgium and Greece, and which was in charge of directing Gladio&#x27;s operations. However, Gladio was actually set up under Minister of Defence (from 1953 to 1958) Paolo Taviani&#x27;s supervision. Besides, the list of Gladio members given by Andreotti was incomplete. It didn&#x27;t include, for example, Antonio Arconte, who described an organization very different from the one brushed by Giulio Andreotti: an organization closely tied to the SID secret service and the Atlanticist strategy. According to Andreotti, the stay-behind organisations set up in all of Europe did not come &quot;under broad NATO supervision until 1959.&quot;

==== Judicial Inquiries ====
The judge Guido Salvini, who worked in the Italian Massacres Commission, found out that several far-right terrorist organizations were the trench troops of a secret army who were linked to the CIA. Salvini said: &quot;The role of the Americans was ambiguous, halfway between knowing and not preventing and actually inducing people to commit atrocities&quot;.

Judge Gerardo D&#x27;Ambrosio found out that in a conference that had the patronage of the Chief Staff of Defense, there were instructions to infiltrate left-wing groups and provoke social tension by carrying out attacks and then blame them on the left.

==== 2000 parliamentary report and the strategy of tension ====
In 2000, a parliamentary commission report from the left-wing coalition &quot;Gruppo Democratici di Sinistra l&#x27;Ulivo&quot; asserted that a strategy of tension had been supported by the United States to &quot;stop the PCI, and to a certain degree also the PSI, from reaching executive power in the country&quot;. It stated that &quot;Those massacres, those bombs, those military actions had been organized or promoted or supported by men inside Italian state institutions and, as has been discovered more recently, by men linked to the structures of United States intelligence.&quot; The report stated that US intelligence agents were informed in advance about several terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place.

It also reported that Pino Rauti, former leader of the MSI Fiamma-Tricolore party, journalist and founder of the Ordine Nuovo (new order) subversive organisation, received regular funding from a press officer at the US embassy in Rome. &#x27;So even before the &#x27;stabilising&#x27; plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the terrorist group was in the pay of the American embassy in Rome.&#x27; a report released by the Democrats of the Left party says.

==== General Serravalle&#x27;s statements ====
General Gerardo Serravalle, who commanded the Italian Gladio from 1971 to 1974, related that &quot;in the 1970s the members of the CPC [Coordination and Planning Committee] were the officers responsible for the secret structures of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Italy. These representatives of the secret structures met every year in one of the capitals... At the stay-behind meetings representatives of the CIA were always present. They had no voting rights and were from the CIA headquarters of the capital in which the meeting took place... members of the US Forces Europe Command were present, also without voting rights. &quot; Next to the CPC a second secret command post was created in 1957, the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC). According to the Belgian Parliamentary Committee on Gladio, the ACC was &quot;responsible for coordinating the &#x27;Stay-behind&#x27; networks in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Holland, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States&quot;. During peacetime, the activities of the ACC &quot;included elaborating the directives for the network, developing its clandestine capability and organising bases in Britain and the United States. In wartime, it was to plan stay-behind operations in conjunction with SHAPE; organisers were to activate clandestine bases and organise operations from there&quot;. General Serravalle declared to the &quot;Commissione Stragi&quot; headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino that the Italian Gladio members trained at a military base in Britain.

=== Belgium ===
After the 1967 withdrawal of France from NATO&#x27;s military structure, the SHAPE headquarters were displaced to Mons in Belgium. In 1990, following France&#x27;s denial of any &quot;stay-behind&quot; French army, Giulio Andreotti publicly said the last Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) meeting, at which the French branch of Gladio was present, had been on October 23 and 24, 1990, under the presidency of Belgian General Van Calster, director of the Belgian military General Service for Intelligence (SGR). In November, Guy Coëme, the Minister of Defense, acknowledged the existence of a Belgian &quot;stay-behind&quot; army, raising concerns about a similar implication in terrorist acts as in Italy. The same year, the European Parliament sharply condemned NATO and the United States in a resolution for having manipulated European politics with the stay-behind armies.

New legislation governing intelligence agencies&#x27; missions and methods was passed in 1998, following two government inquiries and the creation of a permanent parliamentary committee in 1991, which was to bring them under the authority of Belgium&#x27;s federal agencies. The commission was created following events in the 1980s, which included the Brabant massacres and the activities of the far-right group Westland New Post.

=== Denmark ===
The Danish stay-behind army was code-named &quot;Absalon&quot;, after a Danish archbishop, and led by E. J. Harder. It was hidden in the military secret service &quot;Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste&quot; (FE). In 1978, William Colby, former director of the CIA, released his memoirs in which he described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in Scandinavia:

The situation in each Scandinavian country was different. Norway and Denmark were NATO allies, Sweden held to the neutrality that had taken her through two world wars, and Finland were required to defer in its foreign policy to the Soviet power directly on its borders. Thus, in one set of these countries the governments themselves would build their own stay-behind nets, counting on activating them from exile to carry on the struggle. These nets had to be co-ordinated with NATO&#x27;s plans, their radios had to be hooked to a future exile location, and the specialised equipment had to be secured from CIA and secretly cached in snowy hideouts for later use. In the other set of countries, CIA would have to do the job alone or with, at best, &quot;unofficial&quot; local help, since the politics of those governments barred them from collaborating with NATO, and any exposure would arouse immediate protest from the local Communist press, Soviet diplomats and loyal Scandinavians who hoped that neutrality or nonalignment would allow them to slip through a World War III unharmed.

=== France ===
In 1947, Interior Minister Édouard Depreux revealed the existence of a secret stay-behind army in France codenamed &quot;Plan Bleu&quot;. The next year, the &quot;Western Union Clandestine Committee&quot; (WUCC) was created to coordinate secret unorthodox warfare. In 1949, the WUCC was integrated into NATO, whose headquarters were established in France, under the name &quot;Clandestine Planning Committee&quot; (CPC). In 1958, NATO founded the Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC) to coordinate secret warfare.

The network was supported with elements from SDECE, and had military support from the 11th Choc regiment. The former director of DGSE, Admiral Pierre Lacoste, alleged in a 1992 interview with &quot;The Nation&quot;, that certain elements from the network were involved in terrorist activities against de Gaulle and his Algerian policy. A section of the 11th Choc regiment split over the 1962 Évian peace accords, and became part of the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; (OAS), but it is unclear if this also involved members of the French stay-behind network.

&quot;La Rose des Vents&quot; and &quot;Arc-en-ciel&quot; (&quot;Rainbow&quot;) network were part of Gladio. François de Grossouvre was Gladio&#x27;s leader for the region around Lyon in France until his alleged suicide on April 7, 1994. Grossouvre would have asked Constantin Melnik, leader of the French secret services during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), to return to activity. He was living in comfortable exile in the US, where he maintained links with the Rand Corporation.

=== Germany ===
US intelligence also assisted in the set up of a West German stay-behind network. CIA documents released in June 2006 under the 1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, show that the CIA organized &quot;stay-behind&quot; networks of West German agents between 1949 and 1953. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;One network included at least two former Nazi SS members—Staff Sgt. Heinrich Hoffman and Lt. Col. Hans Rues—and one was run by Lt. Col. Walter Kopp, a former German army officer referred to by the CIA as an &quot;unreconstructed Nazi&quot;. &quot;The network was disbanded in 1953 amid political concerns that some members&#x27; neo-Nazi sympathies would be exposed in the West German press.&quot;

Documents shown to the Italian parliamentary terrorism committee revealed that in the 1970s British and French officials involved in the network visited a training base in Germany built with US money.

In 1976, West German secret service BND secretary Heidrun Hofer was arrested after having revealed the secrets of the West German stay-behind army to her husband, who was a spy of the KGB.

In 2004 the German author Norbert Juretzko published a book about his work at the BND. He went into details about recruiting partisans for the German stay-behind network. He was sacked from BND following a secret trial against him because the BND could not find out the real name of his Russian source &quot;Rübezahl&quot; whom he had recruited. A man with the name he put on file was arrested by the KGB following treason in the BND, but was obviously innocent, his name having been chosen at random from the public phone book by Juretzko. According to Juretzko, the BND built up its branch of Gladio, but discovered after the fall of the German Democratic Republic that it was fully known to the Stasi early on. When the network was dismantled, further odd details emerged. One fellow &quot;spymaster&quot; had kept the radio equipment in his cellar at home with his wife doing the engineering test call every four months, on the grounds that the equipment was too &quot;valuable&quot; to remain in civilian hands. Juretzko found out because this spymaster had dismantled his section of the network so quickly, there had been no time for measures such as recovering all caches of supplies.

Civilians recruited as stay-behind partisans were equipped with a clandestine shortwave radio homed in on a fixed frequency. It had a keyboard with digital encryption, making use of traditional Morse code obsolete. They had a cache of further equipment for signalling helicopters or submarines to drop special agents who were to stay in the partisan&#x27;s homes while mounting sabotage operations against the communists.

=== Greece ===
When Greece joined NATO in 1952, the country&#x27;s special forces, LOK (&quot;Lochoi Oreinōn Katadromōn&quot;, i.e., &quot;mountain raiding companies&quot;), were integrated into the European stay-behind network. The CIA and LOK reconfirmed on March 25, 1955, their mutual cooperation in a secret document signed by US General Truscott for the CIA, and Konstantinos Dovas, chief of staff of the Greek military. In addition to preparing for a Soviet invasion, the CIA instructed LOK to prevent a leftist coup. Former CIA agent Philip Agee, who was sharply criticized in the US for having revealed sensitive information, insisted that &quot;paramilitary groups, directed by CIA officers, operated in the sixties throughout Europe [and he stressed that] perhaps no activity of the CIA could be as clearly linked to the possibility of internal subversion.&quot;

According to Daniele Ganser, LOK was involved in the military coup d&#x27;état on 21 April 1967, which took place one month before the scheduled national elections. Under the command of paratrooper Lieutenant Colonel Costas Aslanides, LOK took control of the Greek Defence Ministry while Brigadier General Stylianos Pattakos gained control of communication centres, parliament, the royal palace, and according to detailed lists, arrested over 10,000 people. According to Ganser, Phillips Talbot, the US ambassador in Athens, disapproved of the military coup which established the &quot;Regime of the Colonels&quot; (1967–1974), complaining that it represented &quot;a rape of democracy&quot;—to which Jack Maury, the CIA chief of station in Athens, answered, &quot;How can you rape a whore?&quot;

Arrested and then exiled in Canada and Sweden, Andreas Papandreou later returned to Greece, where he won the 1981 election, forming the first socialist government of Greece&#x27;s post-war history. According to his own testimony, Ganser alleges, he discovered the existence of the secret NATO army, then codenamed &quot;Red Sheepskin&quot;, as acting prime minister in 1984 and had given orders to dissolve it.

Following Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s revelations in 1990, the Greek defence minister confirmed that a branch of the network, known as Operation Sheepskin, operated in his country until 1988.

In December 2005, journalist Kleanthis Grivas published an article in &quot;To Proto Thema&quot;, a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused &quot;Sheepskin&quot; for the assassination of CIA station chief Richard Welch in Athens in 1975, as well as the assassination of British military attaché Stephen Saunders in 2000. This was denied by the US State Department, who responded that &quot;the Greek terrorist organization &#x27;17 November&#x27; was responsible for both assassinations&quot;, and that Grivas&#x27;s central piece of evidence had been the Westmoreland Field Manual which the state department, as well as an independent congressional inquiry, have alleged to be a Soviet forgery. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, &quot;Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials&quot; while &quot;Sheepskin&quot; couldn&#x27;t have assassinated Stephen Saunders for the simple reason that, according to the US government, &quot;the Greek government stated it dismantled the &#x27;stay behind&#x27; network in 1988.&quot;

=== Netherlands ===
Speculation that the Netherlands was involved in &quot;Gladio&quot; arose from the accidental discovery of large arms caches in 1980 and 1983. In the latter incident, people walking in a forest near the village of Rozendaal, near Arnhem, chanced upon a large hidden cache of arms, containing dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives. That discovery forced the Dutch government to confirm that the arms were related to NATO planning for unorthodox warfare.

In 1990, then-Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers told the Dutch Parliament that his office was running a secret organisation that had been set up inside the Dutch defence ministry in the 1950s, but denied it was supervised directly by NATO or other foreign bodies. He went on to inform that successive prime ministers and defence chiefs had always preferred not to inform other Cabinet members or Parliament about the secret organization. It was modelled on the nation&#x27;s World War II experiences of having to evacuate the royal family and transfer government to a government-in-exile, originally aiming to provide an underground intelligence network to a government-in-exile in the event of a foreign invasion, although it included elements of guerrilla warfare. Former Dutch Defence Minister Henk Vredeling confirmed the group had set up arms caches around the Netherlands for sabotage purposes.

Already in 1990, it was known that the weapons cache near Velp, while accidentally &#x27;discovered&#x27; in 1983, had been plundered partially before. It still contained dozens of hand grenades, semiautomatic rifles, automatic pistols, munitions and explosives at the time of discovery, but five hand grenades had gone missing. A Dutch investigative television program revealed on 9 September 2007, that another arms cache that had belonged to Gladio had been ransacked in the 1980s. It was located in a park near Scheveningen. Some of the stolen weapons, including hand grenades and machine guns, later turned up when police officials arrested criminals John Mieremet and Sam Klepper in 1991. The Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD feared at the time that disclosure of the Gladio history of these weapons would have been politically sensitive.

=== Norway ===
In 1957, the director of the secret service NIS, Vilhelm Evang, protested strongly against the pro-active intelligence activities at AFNORTH, as described by the chairman of CPC: &quot;[NIS] was extremely worried about activities carried out by officers at Kolsås. This concerned SB, Psywar and Counter Intelligence.&quot; These activities supposedly included the blacklisting of Norwegians. SHAPE denied these allegations. Eventually, the matter was resolved in 1958, after Norway was assured about how stay-behind networks were to be operated.

In 1978, the police discovered an arms cache and radio equipment at a mountain cabin and arrested Hans Otto Meyer (no), a businessman accused of being involved in selling illegal alcohol. Meyer claimed that the weapons were supplied by Norwegian intelligence. Rolf Hansen, defence minister at that time, stated the network was not in any way answerable to NATO and had no CIA connection.

===Portugal===
In 1966, the CIA set up Aginter Press which, under the direction of Captain Yves Guérin-Sérac (who had taken part in the founding of the OAS), ran a secret stay-behind army and trained its members in covert action techniques amounting to terrorism, including bombings, silent assassinations, subversion techniques, clandestine communication and infiltration and colonial warfare.

=== Turkey ===

In an excerpt from Mehtap Söyler&#x27;s 2015 book entitled &quot;The Turkish Deep State: State Consolidation, Civil-Military Relations and Democracy&quot;, Söyler details how certain Western forces encouraged Turkish nationalism via Operation Gladio. Specifically, Operation Gladio empowered Turanism through the founding member of the Counter-Guerrilla; Alparslan Türkeş — a product of that CIA initiative.

As one of the nations that prompted the Truman Doctrine, Turkey is one of the first countries to participate in Operation Gladio and, some say, the only country where it has not been purged. The counter-guerrillas&#x27; existence in Turkey was revealed in 1973 by then-prime minister Bülent Ecevit.

General Kenan Evren, who became President of Turkey following a successful coup d&#x27;état in 1980, served as the head of the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish branch of Operation Gladio. Historians and outside investigators have speculated that Counter-Guerrilla and several subordinate Intelligence, Special Forces, and Gendarmerie units were possibly involved in numerous acts of state-sponsored terrorism and engineering the military coups of 1971 and 1980. Many of the high ranking plotters of the 1971 and 1980 coup, such as Generals Evren, Memduh Tağmaç, Faik Türün, Sabri Yirmibeşoğlu, Kemal Yamak and Air Force Commander Tahsin Şahinkaya, served at various times under the command of Counter-Guerrilla or the subordinate Tactical Mobilisation Group and Special Warfare Department.

Additionally, the CIA employed people from the far-right, such as Pan-Turkist SS-member Ruzi Nazar (father of Sylvia Nasar), to train the Grey Wolves (), the youth wing of the MHP. Nazar was an Uzbek born near Tashkent who had deserted the Red Army to join the Nazis during World War II in order to fight on the Eastern Front for the creation of a Turkistan. After Germany lost the war, some of its spies found haven in the U.S. intelligence community. Nazar was such a person, and he became the CIA&#x27;s station chief to Turkey.

== Parallel stay-behind operations in non-NATO countries ==
=== Austria ===
In Austria, the first secret stay-behind army was exposed in 1947. It had been set up by the far-right Theodor Soucek and Hugo Rössner, who both insisted during their trial that &quot;they were carrying out the secret operation with the full knowledge and support of the US and British occupying powers.&quot; Sentenced to death, they had their sentences commuted to life in prison and 20 years, respectively, by Karl Renner, to prevent them from potentially becoming martyrs. In August 1952, the convicts were pardoned and released by President Theodor Körner. While there is evidence suggesting that the activities of Soucek and Rössner were tolerated to an extent by local occupation authorities, available American archives do not suggest that they had any connection to U.S. intelligence. A secret review of the situation by US forces in Austria in early January 1948 implies that while the group were presenting themselves as anti-communist allies, the Americans did not trust them, viewing them as &quot;adventurers and opportunists.&quot;

Interior Minister Franz Olah set up a new secret army codenamed &quot;Österreichischer Wander-, Sport- und Geselligkeitsverein&quot; (OeWSGV, literally &quot;Austrian Association of Hiking, Sports and Society&quot;), with the cooperation of MI6 and the CIA. He later explained that &quot;we bought cars under this name. We installed communication centres in several regions of Austria&quot;, confirming that &quot;special units were trained in the use of weapons and plastic explosives&quot;. He stated that &quot;there must have been a couple of thousand people working for us... Only very, very highly positioned politicians and some members of the union knew about it&quot;.

In 1965, police discovered a stay-behind arms cache in an old mine close to Windisch-Bleiberg and forced the British authorities to hand over a list with the location of 33 other caches in Austria.

In 1990, when secret &quot;stay-behind&quot; armies were uncovered all around Europe, the Austrian government said that no secret army had existed in the country. However, six years later, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; revealed the existence of secret CIA arms caches in Austria. Austrian President Thomas Klestil and Chancellor Franz Vranitzky insisted that they had known nothing of the existence of the secret army and demanded that the US launch a full-scale investigation into the violation of Austria&#x27;s neutrality, which was denied by President Bill Clinton. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns—appointed in August 2001 by President George Bush as the US Permanent Representative to the Atlantic Treaty Organization, where, as ambassador to NATO, he headed the combined State-Defense Department United States Mission to NATO and coordinated the NATO response to the September 11, 2001 attacks—insisted: &quot;The aim was noble, the aim was correct, to try to help Austria if it was under occupation. What went wrong is that successive Washington administrations simply decided not to talk to the Austrian government about it.&quot;

=== Finland ===
In 1944, Sweden worked with Finnish Intelligence to set up a stay-behind network of agents within Finland to keep track of post-war activities in that country. While this network was allegedly never put in place, Finnish codes, SIGINT equipment and documents were brought to Sweden and apparently exploited until the 1980s. 

In 1945, Lauri Kumpulainen, a Finnish soldier with left-wing sympathies, exposed a secret stay-behind army which was closed down (so-called &#x27;Weapons Cache Case&#x27;). This operation was organized by Finnish general staff officers (without foreign help) in 1944 to hide weapons in order to sustain large-scale guerrilla warfare in the event the Soviet Union tried to occupy Finland following the end of combat on the Finnish-Soviet front of WWII. Of those 5,000 to 10,000 people involved in the case, 1,488 of them were convicted. Most of them received prison terms of 1–4 months. Overall, the prison sentences of those convicted totaled nearly 400 years.

In 1991, the Swedish media claimed that a secret stay-behind army had existed in neutral Finland with an exile base in Stockholm. Finnish Defence Minister Elisabeth Rehn called the revelations &quot;a fairy tale&quot;, adding cautiously &quot;or at least an incredible story, of which I know nothing.&quot; However, in his memoirs, former CIA director William Colby described the setting-up of stay-behind armies in the Nordic countries, including Finland, with or without the assistance of local governments, to prepare for a Soviet invasion.

=== Spain ===
Several events prior to Spain&#x27;s 1982 membership in NATO have also been tied to Gladio. In May 1976, half a year after Franco&#x27;s death, two Carlist militants were shot down by far-right terrorists, among whom were Gladio operative Stefano Delle Chiaie and members of the Apostolic Anticommunist Alliance (&quot;Triple A&quot;), demonstrating connections between Gladio and the South American &quot;Dirty War&quot; of the Operation Condor. This incident became known as the Montejurra incident. According to a report by the Italian CESIS (executive committee for Intelligence and Security Services), Carlo Cicuttini (who took part in the 1972 Peteano bombing in Italy alongside Vincenzo Vinciguerra), participated in the 1977 Massacre of Atocha in Madrid, killing five people (including several lawyers), members of the Workers&#x27; Commissions trade-unions closely linked with the Spanish Communist Party. Cicuttini was a naturalized Spaniard and exiled in Spain since 1972 (date of the Peteano bombing).

Following Andreotti&#x27;s 1990 revelations, Adolfo Suárez, Spain&#x27;s first democratically elected prime minister after Franco&#x27;s death, denied ever having heard of Gladio. President of the Spanish government in 1981–82, during the transition to democracy, Calvo Sotelo stated that Spain had not been informed of Gladio when it entered NATO. Asked about Gladio&#x27;s relations to Francoist Spain, he said that such a network was not necessary under Franco, since &quot;the regime itself was Gladio.&quot;

According to General Fausto Fortunato, head of Italian SISMI from 1971 to 1974, France and the US had backed Spain&#x27;s entrance to Gladio, but Italy would have opposed it. Following Andreotti&#x27;s revelations, however, Narcís Serra, Spanish Minister of Defence, opened up an investigation concerning Spain&#x27;s links to Gladio. The &quot;Canarias 7&quot; newspaper revealed, quoting former Gladio agent Alberto Volo, who had a role in the revelations of the existence of the network in 1990, that a Gladio meeting had been organized in August 1991 on Gran Canaria island. Alberto Volo also declared that as a Gladio operative, he had received trainings in Maspalomas, on Gran Canaria in the 1960s and the 1970s. &quot;El País&quot; also revealed that the Gladio organization was suspected of having used former NASA installations in Maspalomas, on Gran Canaria, in the 1970s.

André Moyen, former Belgian secret agent, also declared that Gladio had operated in Spain. He said that Gladio had bases in Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastián, and the Canary islands.

=== Sweden ===
In 1951, CIA agent William Colby, based at the CIA station in Stockholm, supported the training of stay-behind armies in neutral Sweden and Finland and in the NATO members Norway and Denmark. In 1953, the police arrested Swedish Nazi Otto Hallberg and discovered the preparations for the Swedish stay-behind army. Hallberg was set free and charges against him were dropped.

In 1990, General Bengt Gustafsson, confirmed that a stay-behind network had existed in the country, but incorrectly added that neither NATO nor the CIA had been involved. Paul Garbler, a CIA officer who had served in Sweden, corrected that Sweden was a &quot;direct participant&quot; in the network, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m not able to talk about it without causing the Swedes a good deal of heartburn.&quot;

=== Switzerland ===

In Switzerland, a secret force called P-26 was discovered, by coincidence, a few months before Giulio Andreotti&#x27;s October 1990 revelations. After the &quot;secret files scandal&quot; (&quot;Fichenaffäre&quot;), Swiss members of parliament started investigating the Defense Department in the summer of 1990. According to Felix Würsten of the ETH Zurich, &quot;P-26 was not directly involved in the network of NATO&#x27;s secret armies but it had close contact to MI6.&quot; Daniele Ganser (ETH Zurich) wrote in the &quot;Intelligence and National Security&quot; review that &quot;following the discovery of the stay-behind armies across Western Europe in late 1990, Swiss and international security researchers found themselves confronted with two clear-cut questions: Did Switzerland also operate a secret stay-behind army? And if yes, was it part of NATO&#x27;s stay-behind network? The answer to the first question is clearly yes... The answer to the second question remains disputed...&quot;

In 1990, Colonel Herbert Alboth, a former commander of P-26, declared in a confidential letter to the Defence Department that he was willing to reveal &quot;the whole truth&quot;. He was later found in his house, stabbed with his own bayonet. The detailed parliamentary report on the Swiss secret army was presented to the public on 17 November 1990. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;P-26 was backed by P-27, a private foreign intelligence agency funded partly by the government, and by a special unit of Swiss army intelligence which had built up files on nearly 8,000 &quot;suspect persons&quot; including &quot;leftists&quot;, &quot;bill stickers&quot;, &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot;, people with &quot;abnormal tendencies&quot; and anti-nuclear demonstrators.
On 14 November, the Swiss government hurriedly dissolved P26 – the head of which, it emerged, had been paid £100,000 a year.&quot;

In 1991, a report by Swiss magistrate Pierre Cornu was released by the Swiss defence ministry. It found that P-26 was without &quot;political or legal legitimacy&quot;, and described the group&#x27;s collaboration with British secret services as &quot;intense&quot;. &quot;Unknown to the Swiss government, British officials signed agreements with P-26 to provide training in combat, communications, and sabotage. The latest agreement was signed in 1987... P-26 cadres participated regularly in training exercises in Britain... British advisers – possibly from the SAS – visited secret training establishments in Switzerland.&quot; P-26 was led by Efrem Cattelan, known to British intelligence.

In a 2005 conference presenting Daniele Ganser&#x27;s research on Gladio, Hans Senn, General Chief of Staff of the Swiss Armed Forces between 1977 and 1980, explained how he was informed of the existence of a secret organisation in the middle of his term of office. According to him, it already became clear in 1980 in the wake of the Schilling/Bachmann affair that there was also a secret group in Switzerland. But former MP, Helmut Hubacher, President of the Social Democratic Party from 1975 to 1990, declared that although it had been known that &quot;special services&quot; existed within the army, as a politician he never at any time could have known that P-26 was behind this. Hubacher pointed out that the President of the parliamentary investigation into P26 (PUK-EMD), the right-wing politician from Appenzell and member of the Council of States for that Canton, Carlo Schmid, had suffered &quot;like a dog&quot; during the commission&#x27;s investigations. Carlo Schmid declared to the press: &quot;I was shocked that something like that is at all possible,&quot; and said to the press he was glad to leave the &quot;conspirational atmosphere&quot; which had weighted upon him like a &quot;black shadow&quot; during the investigations. Hubacher found it especially disturbing that, apart from its official mandate of organizing resistance in case of a Soviet invasion, P-26 had also a mandate to become active should the left succeed in achieving a parliamentary majority.

== Daniele Ganser and criticism ==
Swiss conspiracy theorist Daniele Ganser, in his 2005 book, &quot;NATO&#x27;s Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe&quot;, accused Gladio of trying to influence policies through the means of false flag operations and a strategy of tension. Ganser alleges that on various occasions, stay-behind movements became linked to right-wing terrorism, crime and attempted coups d&#x27;état. In &quot;NATO&#x27;s Secret Armies&quot; Ganser states that Gladio units closely cooperated with NATO and the CIA and that Gladio in Italy was responsible for terrorist attacks against its own civilian population.

=== Criticism of Ganser ===
Peer Henrik Hansen, a scholar at Roskilde University, wrote two scathing criticisms of the book for the &quot;International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Intelligence History&quot;, describing Ganser&#x27;s work as &quot;a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories&quot; that &quot;fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA, CIA, NATO and the European countries.&quot; Hansen also criticized Ganser for basing his &quot;claim of the big conspiracy&quot; on &quot;US Army Field Manual 30-31B&quot;, a supposed Cold War-era forged document. Hayden Peake&#x27;s book review &quot;Intelligence in Recent Public Literature&quot; maintains that, &quot;Ganser fails to document his thesis that the CIA, MI6, and NATO and its friends turned GLADIO into a terrorist organization.&quot; Philip HJ Davies of the Brunel University Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies likewise concludes that the book is &quot;marred by imagined conspiracies, exaggerated notions of the scale and impact of covert activities, misunderstandings of the management and coordination of operations within and between national governments, and... an almost complete failure to place the actions and decisions in question in the appropriate historical context.&quot; According to Davies, &quot;the underlying problem is that Ganser has not really undertaken the most basic necessary research to be able to discuss covert action and special operations effectively.&quot; Olav Riste of the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, writing for the journal &quot;Intelligence and National Security&quot;, mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that &quot;a detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book.&quot; In a later joint article with Leopoldo Nuti of the University of Rome, the two concluded that the book&#x27;s &quot;ambitious conclusions do not seem to be entirely corroborated by a sound evaluation of the sources available.&quot;

Lawrence Kaplan wrote a mixed review commending Ganser for making &quot;heroic efforts to tease out the many strands that connect this interlocking right-wing conspiracy,&quot; but also arguing that &quot;connecting the dots between terrorist organizations in NATO countries and a master plan centred in NATO&#x27;s military headquarters requires a stretch of facts that Ganser cannot manage.&quot; Kaplan believes that some of Ganser&#x27;s conspiracy theories &quot;may be correct,&quot; but that &quot;they do damage to the book&#x27;s credibility.&quot; In a mostly positive review for the journal &quot;Cold War History&quot;, Beatrice Heuser praises Ganser&#x27;s &quot;fascinating study&quot; while also noting that &quot;it would definitely have improved the work if Ganser had used a less polemical tone, and had occasionally conceded that the Soviet Empire was by no means nicer.&quot; Security analyst John Prados writes &quot;Ganser, the principal analyst of Gladio, presents evidence across many nations that Gladio networks amounted to anti-democratic elements in their own societies.&quot;

The US State Department stated in 2006 that Ganser had been taken in by long-discredited Cold War era disinformation and &quot;fooled by the forgery&quot;. In an article about the Gladio/stay-behind networks and &quot;US Army Field Manual 30-31B&quot; they stated, &quot;Ganser treats the forgery as if it was a genuine document in his 2005 book on &#x27;stay behind&#x27; networks, &quot;Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe&quot; and includes it as a key document on his website on the book.&quot;

== US State Department&#x27;s 2006 response ==
The US State Department published a communiqué in January 2006 that, while confirming the existence of NATO stay-behind efforts, in general, and the presence of the &quot;Gladio&quot; stay-behind unit in Italy, in particular, with the purpose of aiding resistance in the event of Soviet aggression directed westward, from the Warsaw Pact, dismissed claims of any United States ordered, supported, or authorized terrorism by stay-behind units.

The State Department said that the accusations of US-sponsored &quot;false flag&quot; operations are rehashed former Soviet disinformation based on documents that the Soviets forged; specifically the Westmoreland Field Manual. The alleged Soviet-authored forgery, disseminated in the 1970s, explicitly formulated the need for a &quot;strategy of tension&quot; involving violent attacks blamed on radical left-wing groups in order to convince allied governments of the need for counter-action. It also rejected a Communist Greek journalist&#x27;s allegations made in December 2005.

== In popular culture ==
* An analogue of Operation Gladio was described in the 1949 fiction novel &quot;An Affair of State&quot; by Pat Frank.

* In the 2012 &quot;Archer&quot; episode &quot;Lo Scandalo&quot;, the character Malory Archer mentions having been involved in Operation Gladio when younger. It is described by Lana Kane as &quot;a weird crypto-fascist CIA shitshow, starring Allen Dulles and a bunch of former Nazis.&quot;

<text>ViewMAX is a CUA-compliant file manager supplied with DR DOS versions 5.0 and 6.0. It is based on a cut-down runtime version of Digital Research&#x27;s GEM/3 graphical user interface modified to run only a single statically built application, the ViewMAX desktop. Support for some unneeded functions has been removed whilst some new functions were added at the same time. Nevertheless, the systems remained close enough for ViewMAX to recognize GEM desktop accessories ( executables) automatically and to allow some native GEM applications ( executables) to be run inside the ViewMAX environment (without having to install and launch GEM first). Many display drivers for GEM 3.xx could be used by ViewMAX as well, enabling ViewMAX to be used with non-standard display adapters and higher resolutions than possible using the default set of ViewMAX drivers. Also, Digital Research&#x27;s SID86, the symbolic instruction debugger that shipped with DR DOS 3.xx and provided dedicated functions to debug GEM applications (see GEM-specific help under SID86 or GEMSID), could be used for ViewMAX as well.

==Versions==
Originally named &quot;Navigator&quot; in beta versions, ViewMAX 1.00 was distributed with DR DOS 5.0 in 1990 to provide an equivalent to DOSSHELL in MS-DOS/PC DOS 4.0. It had a very similar appearance to Digital Research&#x27;s previous GEM desktops – two fixed-size windows. Each window would either contain icons representing drives, directories and files, or a representation of the directory hierarchy. If supported by the underlying operating system (such as DR DOS), file and directory passwords and access permissions were supported. Network drives (including CD-ROM drives) were distinguished through their own icon, different from those of local drives.

In 1991, ViewMAX 2 was distributed with DR DOS 6.0. Various graphical improvements were made in this release, including controls with a 3D appearance and user-selectable colour schemes. The directory tree (if enabled) was now shown beside the list of icons, rather than instead of it. Various settings could be stored in a configuration files named %DRDOSCFG%\VIEWMAX.INI. For more flexible character set support ViewMAX 2 loaded display fonts from a standard DOS file depending on the current code page rather than using a GEM specific character set, a feature also incorporated into FreeGEM since 2005. The DOS/V-compatible Japanese version of ViewMAX, as distributed with DR DOS 6.0/V in 1992, supported DBCS characters loaded by from . Support was added for the DR DOS task switcher TaskMAX; if this was present, applications would be launched as separate tasks, and ViewMAX could switch between them. As TASKMGR in later operating systems such as Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher continued to emulate most of the task switcher API as well, ViewMAX 2 could be used to switch and control multiple concurrently running full-screen DOS tasks under the DR-DOS preemptively multitasking kernel () as well.

ViewMAX 3 was intended to be the graphical file manager for Novell&#x27;s next version of DR DOS. ViewMAX 3 included support for colour icons, movable and resizable windows, program groups, and background images. If the underlying DR-DOS had the optional multi-user security module loaded, ViewMAX would also provide support for the extended world/group/owner access permission system. Although ViewMAX 3 was part of the DR DOS &quot;Panther&quot; Beta 1 distribution in October 1992, it was never completed and apparently abandoned in favour to Apple&#x27;s and Novell&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; team project in 1992/1993, which remained unreleased as well. So, Novell DOS 7, as &quot;DR DOS 7.0&quot; was called in 1994, came without any graphical file manager at all.
When Caldera bought the remaining Digital Research assets from Novell on 23 July 1996, initial plans were to revive GEM and ViewMAX technologies for a low-footprint user interface for OpenDOS in mobile applications as &quot;Caldera View&quot;, but these plans were abandoned by Caldera UK in favour of DR-WebSpyder and GROW. After closing the DR-DOS development center Caldera UK in early 1999, the remaining source code of the ViewMAX 3 beta version was published in April 1999 by the US parent company Caldera Thin Clients under the GPL following continued community request to release the sources, shortly before the company changed its name to Lineo and switched to Linux-based technologies three months later. Various ViewMAX features not previously found in GEM have been incorporated into FreeGEM since then.

<doc id="1212044" wikidata="Q1210707" url="?curid=1212044" title="GEOS (16-bit operating system)">
<text>GEOS (later renamed GeoWorks Ensemble, NewDeal Office, and Breadbox Ensemble) is a computer operating environment, graphical user interface (GUI), and suite of application software. Originally released as PC/GEOS, it runs on MS-DOS-based, IBM PC compatible computers. Versions for some handheld platforms were also released and licensed to some companies.

PC/GEOS was first created by Berkeley Softworks, which later became GeoWorks Corporation. Version 4.0 was developed in 2001 by Breadbox Computer Company, limited liability company (LLC), and was renamed Breadbox Ensemble. In 2015, Frank Fischer, the CEO of Breadbox, died and efforts on the operating system stopped until later in 2017 when it was bought by blueway.Softworks.

PC/GEOS should not be confused with the 8-bit GEOS product from the same company, which runs on the Commodore 64 and Apple II.

== PC/GEOS ==
=== GeoWorks Ensemble ===
 In 1990, GeoWorks (formerly Berkeley Softworks) released PC/GEOS for IBM PC compatible systems. Commonly referred to as &quot;GeoWorks Ensemble&quot;, it was incompatible with the earlier 8-bit versions of GEOS for Commodore and Apple II computers, but provided numerous enhancements, including scalable fonts and multitasking on IBM PC XT- and AT-class PC clones. GeoWorks saw a market opportunity to provide a graphical user interface for the 16 million older model PCs that were unable to run Microsoft Windows 2.x.

GEOS was packaged with a suite of productivity applications. Each had a name prefixed by &quot;Geo&quot;: GeoWrite, GeoDraw, GeoManager, GeoPlanner, GeoDex, and GeoComm. It was also bundled with many PCs at the time, but like other GUI environments for the PC platform, such as Graphics Environment Manager (GEM), it ultimately proved less successful in the marketplace than Windows. Former CEO of GeoWorks claims that GEOS faded away &quot;because Microsoft threatened to withdraw supply of MS-DOS to hardware manufacturers who bundled Geoworks with their machines&quot;.

In December 1992, NEC and Sony bundled an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) version of GeoWorks named the CD Manager with their respective CD-ROM players that sold as retail box add-on peripherals for consumers. The NEC Bundle retailed for around $500.00 with a 1x external CD-ROM, &quot;Small Computer System Interface&quot; (SCSI) interface controller, Labtec CD-150 amplified stereo speakers and 10 software titles.

A scaled-down version of GeoWorks was used by America Online for their MS-DOS-based AOL client software from the time of introduction on IBM compatible PCs until the late 1990s when America Online dropped development for graphical DOS in favor of Microsoft Windows. During that time, the popular single 3.5&quot; self-booting disk that AOL was distributing could be hacked to boot the GeoWorks environment.

IBM released the PC/GEOS-based EduQuest SchoolView network management tool for K-12 schools in 1994. Negotiations to make PC/GEOS an integral part of PC DOS 7.0 failed.

GeoWorks attempted to get third-party developers but was unable to get much support due to expense of the developer kit, which cost $1,000 for the manuals only, and the difficult programming environment, which required a second PC networked via serial port to run the debugger.

Even though PC/GEOS is referred to as an &quot;operating system&quot;, it still requires DOS in load. GEOS and its applications were written in a mix of 8086 assembly language (Espire), an interpreted language called IZL, and C (GEOS Object C: GOC) with non-standard language extensions to support the object-oriented design.

Under DR DOS 6.0, if TASKMAX was loaded before PC/GEOS, PC/GEOS registered as graphical menu system for TASKMAX. This still worked under the pre-emptive multitasker (EMM386 /MULTI + TASKMGR) provided by Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 (and higher), allowing for multiple GEOS and DOS applications to run concurrently.

After the release of Ensemble 2.01, GeoWorks ended support for the desktop version to focus on handhelds and smart devices.

Geoworks Ensemble won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Consumer Program.

=== NewDeal Office ===

A newer version of PC/GEOS was marketed in the late 1990s as &quot;NewDeal Office&quot; from NewDeal Inc. in hopes of creating a market among owners of i386, i486, and Pentium PCs that could not run Windows 95 or Windows 98 effectively. NewDeal released 3 new versions of NewDeal Office (NewDeal Office 2.5, NewDeal Office 3/98 and NewDeal Office 2000) until it went bankrupt in 2000. NDO or NDO 2000 came with a webbrowser named Skipper or Skipper 2000, respectively.

=== Breadbox Ensemble ===

After &quot;NewDeal Inc.&quot; went out of business, Breadbox purchased the rights in the software from GeoWorks in 2001. Their newest PC/GEOS, 4.x, is now a full productivity and internet suite, including web browser (named WebMagick) as well as email. Other essential programs such as word processing, spreadsheet, flat file database and graphics applications are integrated into this package.

On 14 November 2015, Frank S. Fischer, the CEO and owner of Breadbox Ensemble LLC, died of a heart attack, some while after announcing plans to bring GEOS to Android.

== PEN/GEOS ==
PEN/GEOS 1.0 was the new name for PC/GEOS 2.0 when GeoWorks released it on 9 April 1992. PEN/GEOS 1.0 was a pioneering personal digital assistant (PDA) technology. GEOS was also used in the low-end GeoBook laptop from Brother Industries and in several Nokia Communicator models (GEOS 3.0 in models 9000, 9110). PEN/GEOS 2.0 was released in 1992, and version 3.0 was released in 1995.

=== &quot;Zoomer&quot; devices; Tandy Z-PDA, AST GRiDPad 2390, Casio Z-7000 &amp; XL 7000 ===
PEN/GEOS 1.0 was used as the operating system for the Tandy Corporation Z-PDA, which was introduced shortly after the first Apple Newton MessagePad. Palm Computing had been incorporated to create software for this device and shipped its first handwriting recognition software, PalmPrint, personal information manager, Palm Organizer, and synchronization software, PalmConnect, on the Z-PDA. Palm Organizer included the PalmSchedule date book, PalmAddress address book, PalmNotes notebook, a dictionary, calculator, clock, forms calculator, 26 language translation dictionary, on-line help, holiday, and travel information. The device was also sold under license as the AST GRiDPad 2390 and as the Casio Z-7000 which was the best selling version. In the US, Casio sold it under the name XL-7000 without the multi-lingual interface, but added an AOL client and some USA specific help files. These devices were all named &quot;Zoomer&quot; and were the first PDAs with a connection to the online services CompuServe and AOL. This was made possible through the pre-installed dial-up software CompuServeAOL.

=== HP OmniGo 100 &amp; 120 ===
In 1993, GeoWorks released PEN/GEOS 2.0, again based on PC/GEOS 2.0. In 1995, this version of GEOS appeared (running on top of DOS) on the HP OmniGo 100. It featured Graffiti handwriting recognition. The OmniGo is a flip-around clamshell handheld computer powered by a Vadem VG230 integrated PC-on-a-chip. The VG230 chip includes an Intel 80186-instruction set compatible NEC V30 core. It was soon followed by the HP OmniGo 120, which added a high-contrast screen.

=== Brother LW-Writing System ===
Brother LW-screen typewriters use PEN/GEOS and are the only version of the operating system that ships with vendor-provided drivers for scanner and it included a GEOS scanning application. In Germany, the Brother LW750ic system is equipped with PEN/GEOS.

=== Brother GeoBook ===
In 1997, Brother, in collaboration with IBM, brought the GeoBook series of notebooks to market. GeoBook models NB-60, NB-80C, and PN-9100GR used a modified version of PEN/GEOS using the Yago user interface. The GeoBook series was marketed mainly in education and was part of the &quot;IBM Eduquest School View&quot; strategy.

=== Nokia Communicator 9000(i) and 9110(i) ===
In 1996, the Nokia 9000 Communicator smartphone was introduced. This phone uses PEN/GEOS 3.0 and established the smartphone market. Nokia followed with Communicator models 9000i, 9110, and 9110i.

== GEOS-SC ==

GEOS-SC was a 32-bit reduced instruction set computer (RISC) CPU smartphone, OS, and GUI for the Japanese cellphone market. It was released in 1997. Originally built as GeoWorks&#x27; planned future OS and codenamed &#x27;Liberty&#x27;, GEOS-SC became the basis for cellphones designed by Mitsubishi Electric Company (MELCO) of Japan.

== GEOS-SE ==

 Alongside this, GEOS-SE which was an OS designed and developed by Eden Ltd., a UK-based company acquired in 1997 by Geoworks. It became the basis of several other devices, most notably the Seiko Epson Locatio which was a multifunction device incorporating browser, PIM software, phone, GPS and Camera. It was launched in Japan in 1998.

== FreeGEOS ==
Since 2016, the source code of PC/GEOS has been made available as FreeGEOS and can be compiled and edited freely.

<text>Our Generation was an anarchist journal published in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from 1961 through 1994. It was edited, over the entire run, by Dimitrios Roussopoulos.

==History and profile==
The magazine&#x27;s original title was &quot;Our Generation Against Nuclear War&quot;, and its inaugural issue, in 1961, included an introduction by Bertrand Russell, and a mission statement: &quot;devoted to the research, theory, and review of the problems of world peace and directed toward presenting alternative solutions to human conflict&quot;. The founders were members of the Montreal branch of the Combined Universities&#x27; Campaign of Nuclear Disarmament, established by McGill University students during the late 1950s. By the late 1960s the journal was turning towards anarchist solutions, and by the early 1970s it had become a journal of anarchism and libertarian socialism.

&quot;Our Generation&quot; ceased publication in 1994, after producing 24 volumes.

<doc id="1212049" wikidata="Q187562" url="?curid=1212049" title="Ruth Deech, Baroness Deech">
<text>Ruth Lynn Deech, Baroness Deech, DBE (née Fraenkel; born 29 April 1943) is a British academic, lawyer, bioethicist and politician, most noted for chairing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), from 1994 to 2002, and as the former Principal of St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. Deech sits as a Crossbench peer in the House of Lords (2005–) and chaired the Bar Standards Board (2009–2014).

==Early life, family and education==
Born in Clapham, London, Deech is the daughter of a historian and journalist, Josef Fraenkel who was born in 1903 in Ustrzyki Dolne in south-east Poland. She states that she comes from a &quot;very culturally Jewish family&quot;. Her father &quot;was born in Poland and fled, first to Vienna and then Prague, from the Nazis&quot;. He arrived in Britain on 3 September 1939, the day the Allies declared war on Germany. Documents show that he travelled first from Poland to Nazi Germany (Vienna, Prague) and arrived in Great Britain on 3 September 1939. Several other members of their family were murdered in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Her first cousin is Maurice Frankel, Director of the UK Campaign for Freedom of Information.

She was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital school, when the girls part of the school was located in Hertford. She graduated from St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford with a first in Law in 1965.

==Career==

Deech returned to St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1970 to be a tutorial fellow in Law, a post she retained until 1991 when she was elected principal of the college. She retired in 2004, and was succeeded by Tim Gardam. The college named the Ruth Deech Building, which was completed in 2005, after her.

Deech held many other positions during her career; she served as Senior Proctor of the University of Oxford between 1985 and 1986, as a member of the University&#x27;s Hebdomadal Council of the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority from 1994 until 2002, and was appointed to a four-year term as a Governor of the BBC in 2002, the same year that she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE), in recognition of her work at the HFEA.

After leaving St. Anne&#x27;s, Deech was appointed the first Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education from 2004 to 2008, dealing with the resolution of student complaints at all UK universities.

On 22 July 2005, it was announced by the House of Lords Appointments Commission that she would be made a life peer, sitting as a crossbencher. On 5 October 2005, she was created Baroness Deech, of Cumnor in the County of Oxfordshire, and introduced in the House of Lords on 25 October 2005. She delivered her maiden speech on 24 November 2005.

In 1999, &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper named her as the 107th most powerful person in Britain, and in 2001, Deech was placed at no.26 in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The God List&quot;, which ranked &quot;the fifty people of faith in Britain who exercise the most power and influence over our lives&quot;. In November 2007, Deech published &quot;IVF to Immortality: Controversy in the Era of Reproductive Technology&quot;, with co-author Anna Smajdor.

Between 2004 and 2008, Deech was Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education and a Professor of Law at Gresham College in London, where she gave a series of public lectures on family relationships and the law. Deech was also the Chair of the Bar Standards Board between 2009-2015.

Deech has been a Director of JNF-UK
In December 2016 Deech argued that Jewish students at UK universities were subject to increasing anti-Semitism. She is a Patron of the activist group UK Lawyers for Israel.

In June 2020, Baroness Deech accused Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government Robert Jenrick of breaching &quot;the guidance on planning propriety&quot; over his management of a planning application to build a national Holocaust memorial, which she described as controversial.

In October 2023, she was announced as Chair of the House of Lords Appointments Commission for a five-year term.

==Returned family property==
In 2008, it emerged that Eugeniusz Waniek, a 101-year-old Polish artist and art professor living in Kraków, had in his possession a set of silver cutlery which had once belonged to Deech&#x27;s father&#x27;s family, the Fraenkels. Waniek had been a Polish Christian neighbour and friend of the Fraenkels in pre-war Ustrzyki Dolne, a small town near the Polish/Ukrainian border. Deech&#x27;s grandfather, Moses Fraenkel, owned an oil refinery there had been a long-serving mayor of the town.

Nazi German troops raided Ustrzyki Dolne in September 1942, rounding up the town&#x27;s large Jewish population. Deech&#x27;s aunt, Helena Fraenkel, managed to pass a bundle of the silverware to Waniek for safekeeping, risking her life in doing so. Other Jews in the town were shot for refusing to hand over valuables to Nazis. Helena was murdered in the Belzec extermination camp. Waniek looked after the silver, at one stage burying it in his garden to hide it from the Nazis, which would have also been punishable by death. He never saw the Fraenkels again.

The story was uncovered by a neighbour of Waniek&#x27;s, Marek Marko, and historian Professor Norman Davies in 2008. When Deech and her British family visited Waniek, he presented to them the silverware (and the tablecloth that bundled it) that he had kept in a drawer for 67 years. He died 8 months later, aged 102.

Deech has criticized Poland regarding its policy for compensation of goods stolen during German occupation. In May 2019, Deech claimed during a House of Lords debate that Poland is “squatting on property of 3 million Shoah victims” and that it was the &quot;most egregious offender” when it came to returning Nazi loot”.

<text>Dermot Gleeson SC (born 22 April 1948) is an Irish barrister who served as Attorney General of Ireland from 1994 to 1997.

Educated in Blackrock College, Dublin and University College Dublin. Gleeson holds B.A. and LL.M degrees and qualified as a barrister at the King&#x27;s Inns, Dublin. His father was a barrister and was later appointed a Circuit Court Judge, and two of his brothers are also barristers. Gleeson was called to the Irish bar in 1970 and first practised law on the Cork Circuit, away from Dublin, Ireland&#x27;s main legal centre. In the early 1970s Gleeson was a part-time lecturer in Constitutional Law at University College Cork.

Gleeson moved to Dublin when he was appointed a Senior Counsel in 1979, at age 30. He is believed to be the youngest &#x27;silk&#x27; appointed in the common law world in the last century, beating noted counsel such as the Australian QC Tony Morriss, who was made a silk at 32.

Gleeson was a leading barrister in Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s before he became a senior government advisor and then a businessman. From 1994–1997, Gleeson was Attorney General of Ireland, serving as chief legal advisor to the government of Taoiseach John Bruton. Gleeson is a Bencher of King&#x27;s Inns. He is also a visiting fellow at the School of Law at University College Dublin.

In more recent years Gleeson became known for his business career. In 2000, he joined the board of Independent News and Media Plc as a non-executive director and in 2003, he was appointed Chairman of Ireland&#x27;s largest bank Allied Irish Banks. His time in charge of AIB Group coincided with the Global Financial Crisis, which resulted in the enormous drops in its share price, leading to the infamous &#x27;egging&#x27; incident at AIB Group&#x27;s May 2009 shareholder&#x27;s meeting. In 2003, Gleeson was appointed ombudsman for the Diamond Trading Company (DTC), the marketing offshoot of diamond mining giant De Beers. In 2007, he was appointed chairman of the Governing Body of University College, Cork.

Gleeson is a former Auditor of the Literary and Historical Society, University College Dublin, and winner of the Irish Times National Debating Championship.

He currently resides in Dublin. He is married and has four children.

<doc id="1212085" wikidata="Q952866" url="?curid=1212085" title="Chris Judd">
<text>Christopher Dylan Judd (born 8 September 1983) is a former professional Australian rules footballer and captain of both the West Coast Eagles and Carlton Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.

Widely regarded as one of the best footballers in the modern game, Judd twice won the league&#x27;s highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal, and was a dual Leigh Matthews Trophy winner as the AFL Players Association most valuable player. He was also a premiership captain, having captained the West Coast Eagles to the 2006 AFL Premiership. Consistently recognised as one of the game&#x27;s premier midfielders, Judd was selected in the All-Australian team six times, including as captain in 2008. At a representative level, he played for Australia in the 2002 International Rules Series and for Victoria in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match in 2008.

Judd is recognised as a great at two clubs: West Coast and Carlton. During his 134 games with West Coast, he captained the club for two seasons and won two Club Champion Awards. After returning to Melbourne to captain the Carlton Football Club, Judd won the John Nicholls Medal as the club&#x27;s Best and Fairest three times, and became the fourth player in AFL history to win a Brownlow Medal at more than one club. In August 2021 Judd was elevated into the AFL Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Judd was born in Melbourne to Andrew Judd and Lisa Engel. He was raised in Melbourne&#x27;s bayside suburbs, where he played for the East Sandringham Junior Football Club before he attended Caulfield Grammar School. Judd was an all-round sportsman and junior track and field star and solid cricket player. He won the APS U17 1500m representing Caulfield Grammar and the Ferret Track Club. At Caulfield Grammar, he began to focus on Australian rules football and later captained the school&#x27;s First team. Judd attained an ENTER score of 96.20 on his Victorian Certificate of Education. He attended St Leonard&#x27;s College throughout his primary school years.

Judd was a graduate of the 2000 AIS/AFL Academy and participated in the 2000 AFL Under 18 Championships, although due to his young age at 17, he was too young to be drafted by an AFL club. He played TAC Cup football with the Sandringham Dragons through to 2001.

At the 2001 AFL Under 18 Championships, Judd was named captain of the Vic Metro team, despite chronic shoulder problems. Although he missed the 2001 AFL Draft Camp, his performances at the state championships made him an obvious standout to recruiters and he was tipped to be picked high in the 2001 AFL Draft. Judd was taken by West Coast with its priority draft pick (No. 3 overall) in what was later to be called the &quot;super draft&quot; due to the standout quality of the players to have developed from that draft year.

==AFL career==

===West Coast Eagles career (2002–2007)===
Judd played only one WAFL match before making his debut for West Coast in round 2, 2002. He had an impressive debut season, winning the AFLPA Best First Year Player Award. In his second season, he alternated between the midfield and forward line and with several dominant performances he finished runner up in the club&#x27;s best and fairest. He was appointed as one of the Eagles&#x27; four vice-captains prior to the commencement of the 2004 season.

====Breakthrough season, Brownlow Medal and grand final loss (2004–2005)====
2004 was Judd&#x27;s breakthrough season in which he combined with captain Ben Cousins, midfielder Daniel Kerr and ruckman Dean Cox in the Eagles&#x27; midfield. Judd averaged 22 disposals, kicked 24 goals for the season, and became West Coast&#x27;s first Brownlow medallist, polling 30 votes to finish seven ahead of runner-up Mark Ricciuto. Additionally, he was named to his first All-Australian team as a wingman, and won the Eagles&#x27; Club Champion award for the first time. In 2005, he again averaged 22 disposals and was runner-up to Cousins as Club Champion; he kicked the Goal of the Year and won the Norm Smith Medal in West Coast&#x27;s four-point loss to in the 2005 AFL Grand Final.

====Captain and grand final win (2006–2007)====

On 1 March 2006, Judd was named captain of the club, succeeding Ben Cousins who stepped down from the role for disciplinary reasons. He led the Eagles to a one-point victory against Sydney in the 2006 AFL Grand Final, winning his only AFL Premiership medallion. Additionally, he won his second club best and fairest award, his second All-Australian selection and the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFL Players Association&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

Judd&#x27;s strong form continued into 2007 and he polled Brownlow votes in each of his first eight games for the season. However, as the year progressed, he was hampered by a chronic groin injury which sidelined him for several weeks and restricted his performance in the games he played. He was forced to play-off the bench and in the forward line often and was rested for several games in anticipation of playing in the finals series. He had won one premiership and was runner-up with the West Coast Eagles in 2005.

===Leaving West Coast (2007)===
On 16 September 2007, two days after West Coast&#x27;s semi-final elimination by Collingwood, it was announced that Judd had left West Coast and would be requesting a trade to a club in Victoria. He notified West Coast coach John Worsfold and CEO Trevor Nisbett of his intentions earlier that day. His departure created much attention and speculation among the Melbourne-based clubs, the media and the football community.

In the weeks following the announcement of his departure, Judd met with four clubs: Essendon, Melbourne, Collingwood and Carlton. On 2 October 2007, Judd announced that his preferred club was Carlton, and Carlton was also considered most likely to secure a trade with West Coast, because the club held two early draft picks which could be used in negotiations. On 11 October 2007, Judd was officially traded to Carlton along with a third round selection in the 2007 AFL Draft (No. 46 overall) for Carlton&#x27;s first and second round selections (No. 3 and 20) and Josh Kennedy, who was reluctant to leave Carlton. Judd was subsequently given the No. 5 guernsey vacated by the trade of Kennedy, and he signed a six-year, $6,000,000 contract with the club.

===Carlton career (2008–2015)===
====Captain and second Brownlow Medal (2008–2010)====
During the off-season, Judd was awarded the captaincy of the club entering into his first season with the Blues. His first game in navy blue was a Friday afternoon practice match on 7 March 2008 against the Western Bulldogs at MC Labour Park, with his presence attracting 12,000 fans, and he began his senior career with the club in the first round. His return match against West Coast at Subiaco Oval in round 7 was widely anticipated in the media, and Carlton won by 37 points. Judd played 21 of the 22 home-and-away games through the season was named All-Australian captain and ruck rover – his third All-Australian selection, and first as captain – and won the John Nicholls Medal for the best and fairest of the Carlton Football Club. He also represented the Victorian team the following week for the Hall of Fame Tribute Match. Judd again won the John Nicholls Medal and All-Australian selection in 2009.

Judd had a controversial end to his 2009 season. In Carlton&#x27;s elimination final loss to Brisbane, Judd was cited by the Match Review Panel for misconduct against Michael Rischitelli, after Judd made unnecessary contact near Rischitelli&#x27;s eyes. The media initially reported the case as eye-gouging, and Judd created a bigger controversy when he stated that his intention was not to eye-gouge, but to push a pressure point behind Rischitelli&#x27;s ear. Judd later said that his comment was intended as dry humor, but it was misinterpreted as genuine and prompted condemnation from many sources, from sports commentators to martial arts experts. After contesting the charge and appealing the penalty at the AFL Tribunal, Judd was suspended for three weeks. In another deadpan statement after the hearing, he stated &quot;I&#x27;ve since watched a couple of Steven Seagal movies and realised that pressure points are no laughing matter,&quot; but he also acknowledged his own &quot;stupidity&quot; in the controversy. Then, his leadership was called into question when the team misbehaved during an organised Christmas booze cruise, which saw suspensions to teammates Andrew Walker, Eddie Betts and Ryan Houlihan.

After missing the opening three rounds of the 2010 season due to the &quot;pressure point&quot; incident, Judd earned three Brownlow votes in each of his first five matches for the season, going on to win his second Brownlow Medal with 30 votes, four ahead of 2009 Brownlow Medallist Gary Ablett, Jr. He became the thirteenth VFL/AFL player to win the Brownlow more than once, the fourth VFL/AFL player to win the Brownlow at two different clubs (West Coast and Carlton), and the first VFL/AFL player to twice poll thirty or more votes in a season. Judd also won his fifth All-Australian selection, being named on the interchange bench, and his third consecutive John Nicholls Medal, becoming the only player other than Nicholls to win the Carlton best and fairest award three times in a row.

====Return to finals and further awards (2011–2012)====
In 2011, Judd led Carlton to its best season in a decade, helping the team finish 5th at the end of the season, and to record its first finals victory since 2001. He was awarded the Leigh Matthews Trophy for the second time in his career, as well as the AFLPA&#x27;s Best Captain Award for the first time. He was named vice-captain and ruck-rover of the All-Australian team, his fourth consecutive selection. He had entered the Brownlow Medal count as an unbackable favourite, with Sportsbet electing to pay out early after round 20, but he ultimately finished fifth. He played his 200th AFL game during the season.

====Final years====
In 2012, Judd played his 100th match for Carlton as captain against Hawthorn in round 14. In round 16 against he was reported for misconduct in that he pulled opposition player Leigh Adams&#x27; arm up, causing the shoulder to dislocate, in a move known as a &quot;chicken wing tackle&quot;. Judd denied that he intended to hurt Adams, but the tribunal found him guilty and suspended him for four matches. He finished third in the John Nicholls Medal for the 2012 season.

Following the 2012 season, Judd took on a smaller role in the team, electing to relinquish the captaincy and step down from the leadership group. After his original six-year contract ended at the end of 2013, he began signing single-year contracts in preparation for the end of his career. In round 10, 2015, he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his left knee and subsequently announced his retirement days later, bringing an end to his 279-game career.

==Playing style==
At his peak, Judd was the best midfielder in the game and is widely regarded as one of the best players of the 2000s decade. The strengths and traits of Judd&#x27;s playing style were different between his time at West Coast and his time at Carlton, and he has been widely lauded for his proficiency at both. At West Coast, while he was a strong ball-winner, it was as an outside midfielder and ball-user where he distinguished himself. He possessed a combination of explosive speed, acceleration, agility and core strength which few if any players in the league could match; these attributes gave him the ability to receive the ball in traffic, then break free from or weave around taggers and opponents, allowing him to take clearing kicks in open space which were damaging to opposition teams. By the time he had joined Carlton, he had lost much of his acceleration and agility owing to the groin injuries he suffered in 2007. He overcame this by converting his game style to predominantly inside ball-winning role. By virtue of his core strength and balance, he became one of the best in the league at receiving ruck tap-outs, and riding or shaking off tackles in packs and congestion to win clearing handpasses to Carlton&#x27;s outside midfielders.

==Footballing recognition==
Judd has been praised by AFL journalists and past players in addition to formal awards he has received.


In 2009, Judd appeared alongside other AFL footballers in an AFL television advertisement titled &quot;AFL: In a League of its Own&quot;, which featured prominent AFL players playing Australian rules football at famous sporting venues around the world, and in the middle of other sports being played, including basketball, Association football and American football. Judd is featured in a scene where he receives a kick from Aaron Davey on a racecourse in front of a group of racehorses. Shortly before he is overrun by the racehorses, he handballs the ball to Sydney Swans player Adam Goodes.

==Media appearances==
Towards the end of 2003, Judd began writing a column on the West Coast Eagles official website called &quot;Juddy&#x27;s Jibe&quot;.

Throughout the 2006 season, the column was also published in Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;, in which Judd wrote about issues such as global warming, terrorism, superficiality in the mass media, world peace and James Surowiecki&#x27;s book &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot;.

In 2009, Judd was featured in the official advertisement for the AFL, receiving a mark from Aaron Davey on a basketball court and then sprinting in front of a stampede of horses on a horse racing track before handballing to Adam Goodes.

After doing some guest commentary in 2016, in November 2016 Judd joined radio station Triple M in a special comments role.

<text>[[Dame]] Carolyn Julie Fairbairn (born 13 December 1960) is a British businesswoman, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, and a former non-executive director of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lloyds Banking Group, BAE Systems, and the UK Statistics Authority. She has been the Chair of the Royal Mencap Society since March 2022.

==Early life and education==
Fairbairn attended Bryanston School as a sixth-form scholar. She graduated with a BA in economics (double first) from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, then an MA in international relations from the University of Pennsylvania, followed by an MBA from INSEAD in France.

==Career==
She began her career as an economist at the World Bank. In 1985, she became a business and financial journalist, writing for &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine.

In 1988, she joined McKinsey &amp; Company as a management consultant and, during a seven-year career, rose to partner. She worked with companies in sectors including brewing, DIY retailing, computer services, investment management and newspapers, advising on mergers, business expansion, cost control and global competitiveness. In 1995, she joined the Downing Street Policy Unit under the then prime minister, John Major, developing policy for health and social services.

In 1997, Fairbairn was appointed director of strategy for BBC Worldwide, later promoted to director of strategy ad distribution, and also became a member of the BBC&#x27;s executive board. She was responsible for delivery of the BBC&#x27;s services to viewers, including on cable and satellite. She managed a budget of £150 million and negotiated the BBC&#x27;s major distribution deals with Sky, Virgin and BT. She helped to develop the BBC&#x27;s digital strategy and renewal of its charter, and was instrumental in creating One BBC. In 2002/3, she created and launched Freeview – a joint venture between the BBC, Sky and Arqiva, which became one of the UK&#x27;s most successful new television services.

On 6 October 2004, the BBC announced that Fairbairn and her husband had &quot;decided to take time out from their careers to spend a year travelling around the world with their three children&quot;.

Fairbairn briefly rejoined McKinsey &amp; Company in 2006, before becoming director of corporate development and strategy at ITV plc between 2007 and 2010. She joined the company at a time of crisis as the advertising market collapsed following the financial crash. She was put in charge of ITV&#x27;s emergency cost-reduction programme to cut the company&#x27;s cost base by 25%. This enabled ITV to weather the storm and subsequently return to growth.

On 24 July 2013 David Currie, the chairman-designate of the new Competition and Markets Authority, announced Fairbairn&#x27;s appointment as a non-executive director. Between 2008 and 2011, Carolyn was a non-executive director of the Financial Services Authority.

Fairbairn has extensive boardroom experience, including as a non-executive director of Lloyds Banking Group (2012-15), The Vitec Group, a medium-sized photographic and broadcast equipment supplier (2012-1), the global outsourcer Capita (2014-15) and the UK Statistics Authority (2013-15).

In March 2021, she was appointed non-executive director of BAE Systems plc. She resigned just over a year later in May 2022 to take up the position of Chair of the Royal Mencap Society. 

==Confederation of British Industry (CBI)==
In June 2015, it was announced that she would replace John Cridland in November as director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, as a result of which she would resign all other positions aside from her chair of the charity, Marie Curie Cancer Care.

Fairbairn has spoken about her vision for the CBI saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve spent most of my working life in British business and believe deeply in its purpose as a creator of fulfilling jobs, quality of life and prosperity. I&#x27;m committed to using my experience to speak up passionately on behalf of British businesses of all sizes on the national and international stage.&quot;

In June 2020, the CBI announced that Fairbairn would step down at the end of 2020 and would be replaced by Tony Danker.

==Personal life==
She is married to Peter Chittick and they have three children. Chittick is Canadian, trained as a lawyer, and met Fairbairn when they were students at INSEAD. He is a multimillionaire property developer, and together they own the &quot;boutique&quot; Hotel Crillon Le Brave in Provence, France.

<text>Frank Marion Wanlass (May 17, 1933, in Thatcher, AZ – September 9, 2010, in Santa Clara, California) was an American electrical engineer. He is best known for inventing CMOS (complementary MOS) logic in 1963. CMOS has since become the standard semiconductor device fabrication process for MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors).

==Biography==
He obtained his PhD from the University of Utah. Wanlass invented CMOS (complementary MOS) logic circuits with Chih-Tang Sah in 1963, while working at Fairchild Semiconductor. Wanlass was given for &quot;Low Stand-By Power Complementary Field Effect Circuitry&quot; in 1967.

In 1963, while studying MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) structures, he noted the movement of charge through oxide onto a gate. While he did not pursue it, this idea would later become the basis for EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory) technology.

In 1964, Wanlass moved to General Microelectronics (GMe), where he made the first commercial MOS integrated circuits, and a year later to General Instrument Microelectronics Division in New York, 
where he developed four-phase logic.

He was also remembered for his contribution to solving threshold voltage stability in MOS transistors due to sodium ion drift.

In 1991, Wanlass was awarded the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Award.

In 2009, on the 50th anniversary of both the MOSFET and the integrated circuit, Frank Wanlass was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his invention of CMOS logic. He was part of the 2009 class celebrating semiconductor pioneers, along with inventors of semiconductor technologies such as the MOSFET (Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng), planar process (Jean Hoerni), EPROM (Dov Frohman) and molecular beam epitaxy (Alfred Y. Cho).

Wanlass died on 9 September 2010.

<text>Hindley ( ) is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester, England. It is east of Wigan and covers an area of . Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Hindley (which includes Hindley Green) borders the towns and villages of Ince-in-Makerfield, Aspull, Westhoughton, Atherton and Westleigh in the former borough of Leigh. In 2001, Hindley had a population of 23,457, increasing to 28,000 at the 2011 Census. It forms part of the wider Greater Manchester Urban Area.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name Hindley is derived from the Old English &quot;hind&quot; and &quot;leah&quot;, meaning a &quot;clearing frequented by hinds or does&quot;.

The town is first recorded as &quot;Hindele&quot; in 1212 and then variously as &quot;Hindeleye&quot; [1259], &quot;Hyndeley&quot; [1285 and 1332],&quot;Hindelegh&quot;[1301], &quot;Hyndelegh&quot; [1303 and 1375]. The first recorded use of its current spelling, Hindley, was in 1479.

===Early history===
Hindley was one of 15 berewicks of the royal manor of Newton before the Norman conquest in 1066. After the conquest, it formed part of the Barony of Makerfield.
The area was held by free tenants until 1330 when Robert Langton, Baron Makerfield, gave the lordship of the manor to his younger son. His descendants were lords of the manor until 1765 when it was sold to the Duke of Bridgewater.

From the Middle Ages until the 18th century the land was a mixture of pastoral, farming and woodland and the farmers were tenants of a variety of lords.
Parish registers from the end of the 17th century reveal that residents were Yeomen, independent farmers who supplemented their income by spinning and weaving. There are also references to Blacksmiths, whitesmiths, nailers and wheelwrights. Hindley was noted for its nail making between the 17th and 19th centuries.

===Industrial Revolution===
The first recorded coal mine was in 1528 and by the end of the 19th century, there were over 20 collieries in the area. Ladies Lane Colliery belonging to the Wigan Coal and Iron Company employed 282 underground and 40 surface workers in 1896. At the start of the 20th century, profitable coal seams were nearly exhausted and concerns were raised regarding the need to diversify industry and further develop the cotton mills. Peak production of coal was achieved just before the First World War. The period between the First and Second world wars was marked by the closure of most collieries and mills including Hindley Field and Swan Lane collieries in 1927, Hindley Green Colliery in 1928; Lowe Hall Colliery in 1931; Lowe Mill closing in 1934 and Worthington Mill was demolished. During the post-war period, the Hindley workings became part of the large colliery complexes developed at Bickershaw, Parsonage and Golborne.

Cotton manufacturing became important from the end of the 17th century until the middle of the 20th century. Hand-loom weaving was one of the chief industries, each cottage having a weaving shop attached and as the Industrial Revolution developed, larger mills were built. The first cotton factory was built in 1785 by Richard Battersby at Lowe Mill, a former water corn-mill. In 1822, John Pennington constructed his first power-driven mill. He was a significant employer of hand-loom weavers in the late 18th and early 19th century.

In 1790 Market Street, then known as Mill Lane, remained unmetalled and undeveloped but by 1835 John Leyland provided an insight into the growth of the town when he wrote, &quot;Mr Pennington is extending his works, and a new mill is being built by Mr Walker. When these get completed a large increase in inhabitants must follow. In a small time it will doubtless rank as a small town.&quot;

The population of Hindley increased during the 19th century from 2,300 in 1811 to 23,000 in 1911 reflecting the transformation of the town from a country village to a small densely populated industrial town. The economic depression of the 1920s and 1930s hit Hindley hard, and by the time of the Second World War the population had declined to 19,000.

The coal mining and cotton spinning have all disappeared and most residents of Hindley now work in Wigan, Bolton, St Helens and Warrington or commute to Manchester or Liverpool.

==Governance==

Hindley was a chapelry, in the parish of Wigan in the Hundred of West Derby, a judicial division of southwest Lancashire. In 1837 Hindley became part of the Wigan Poor Law Union, which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law and made use of buildings on Frog Lane Wigan and at Hindley.
The Local Government Act of 1858 was adopted by the township in 1867, and under the Local Government Act 1894 an Urban District council of fifteen members was constituted. Hindley Town Hall, designed by Heaton, Ralph and Heaton, was opened in 1903; Hindley Urban District Council continued to administer the area until it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in 1974.

==Geography==
Hindley covers an area of , mostly pasture and the underlying rocks are the coal measures. Some ancient woodland remains today in Borsdane Wood which is protected as a Local Nature Reserve.
Hindley town centre is approximately three miles east of Wigan and adjoins Leigh on its south-east side. The pattern of roads is little changed from medieval times, the road from Prescot to Bolton, A58, and road linking Ormskirk with Boothstown, the A577 cross near the town centre.

==Demography==
The population of Hindley increased during the 19th century from 2,300 in 1811 to 24,100 in 1911 reflecting the transformation of the town from a country village to a small, dense industrial town. The economic depression of the 1920s and 1930s hit Hindley hard and by the time of the Second World War the population had declined to 19,000. The Census of 2001 showed that the population had returned to that of a century earlier.

==Transport==
Public transport in Hindley is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester.
There are public transport links by rail from Hindley railway station to all stops between Wigan Wallgate and Manchester via Bolton and Atherton, operated by Northern. There are two platforms in use, with the remains of two older and disused platforms still in existence.

==Education==
Hindley and Abram Grammar School established in 1632 survived until the 1990s when, as Park High School, it was closed. The building survives as a teachers&#x27; centre on Park Road. The original school was situated in &quot;Lowe Hall&quot; and the first edition of the Ordnance Survey map (1848) shows it was at the end of a short track off Stony Lane, now Liverpool Road. It was known as &quot;The Lowe School&quot;. The school relocated to Park Road in 1856 Originally pupils attended without payment but by 1829 the master was at liberty to make charges for instruction in Latin, writing and arithmetic. By 1882 the building consisted of a large schoolroom, a smaller classroom and a headmaster&#x27;s house. Between 1900 and its closure Hindley and Abram grew in size. The school was supported by a charitable foundation which continues to operate.

Mornington High School was established in the early 1960s and became a comprehensive in 1976. The school was renamed Hindley High School in 2006, and became Outwood Academy Hindley in 2022.

==Religion==


The first chapel was built by public subscription in 1641 on land given by George Green. It was built as a Chapel of ease to Wigan Parish Church with the blessing of the Rector of Wigan, Bishop Bridgeman. The church was originally Puritan, and its first minister, Thomas Tonge, preached the Presbyterian discipline. He was succeeded by William Williamson and James Bradshaw who was ejected for nonconformity in 1662. The chapel was unused for six years. It was consecrated in 1698 on All Saints&#x27; Day. All Saints&#x27; Church was rebuilt in 1766 and modifications made in 1863. It remains much the same as then, with an upper gallery and wide nave. There are windows dedicated to Hindley&#x27;s families and an east window depicting early English saints.

St Peter&#x27;s Church was built in 1866 and contained an organ by Edmund Schulze since replaced by an electronic organ. The clock tower contains a set of bells. The war memorial, outside, was unveiled on 4 November 1922 and was built in a simple style.

Hindley has a tradition of Methodism and non-conformity. The Wesleyan Methodists acquired land in 1846 and built a chapel in 1851. The United Methodist Free Church had two chapels at Hindley Green, Brunswick Chapel, built in 1855, and another in 1866. The Primitive Methodists had a chapel at Castle Hill, built in 1856. The Independent Methodists had a church at Lowe Green, built in 1867, and later on Argyle Street. The Particular Baptists built Ebenezer Chapel in Mill Lane in 1854, converted to a restaurant in recent years. The Congregationalists made an attempt to build a church in 1794, but no church was formed until 1812; St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel was built in 1815, meetings for worship having been held some years earlier in cottages. Presbyterians built a chapel in 1698, the present congregation is Unitarian in doctrine. St John&#x27;s Methodist Church at the top of Market Street was built in 1868. The Church of Christ in Argyle Street from the mid-1800s to present.

Nothing is known of the permanence of Catholicism during the 17th century, but mass was probably said at Lowe Hall as Dom John Placid Acton, a Benedictine, was stationed at this place in 1699 and died there in 1727. Succeeding priests, who till 1758 resided chiefly at Park Hall in Charnock Richard, or at Standish Hall, moved the chapel to Lowe Hall and then to Hindley village. From 1758 there has been a resident Benedictine priest in charge of worship and the present church of St. Benedict in Market Street was built in 1869. From 1948–62 the parish priest of St. Benedict&#x27;s was the eminent composer and liturgist Dom Gregory Murray OSB.

The cemetery on Castle Hill Road was opened in 1879 and is divided into denominational sections and of note is the amount of masonic gravestones to be found throughout. Hindley has a long masonic tradition that still survives today.

==Landmarks==
Leyland Library and Museum was built in 1886 by Thomas Worthington. It is designed in a Free-Elizabethan style and given to the people of Hindley by Nathaniel Eckersley, on the instruction of John Leyland upon his death.

The Bird I&#x27;th Hand public house at the main crossroads in the town and the Lord Nelson Hotel on Bridge Street both have eighteenth-century origins. The Lord Nelson is a Grade II listed building. The &#x27;Last Orders&#x27; public house with its painted red brick, moulded brick eaves cornice and Doric doorcases dates from the nineteenth century.

No.5 Deansgate is a rare surviving example of a modest vernacular cottage dating from the eighteenth century or earlier and illustrates a type once common in Hindley.

Borsdane Wood is a place of outstanding natural beauty and in 1986 was declared a Local Nature Reserve.

==Notable families==

John Leyland (1832–1883), a mill owner and benefactor, was born in Mill Lane (Market Street) in 1832 to a family of cloth makers. He was a governor of Hindley and Abram Grammar School and published a history, &quot;Memorials of Hindley&quot; in 1873. He left his estate to Nathaniel Eckersley and instructed that it should benefit Hindley. It paid for extensions to the Grammar School and built the Leyland Public Library, and Leyland Park, on Park Road, Hindley.

One year later, he opened the Eckersley Gardens at Poolstock, a memorial seat was placed in memory of his father. He was appointed High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1919.

The Penningtons were industrialists in the late 18th and mid-19th centuries. Their empire began with a single mill in 1822 which John Pennington expanded to six by the middle of the century. His son and grandson became powerful figures in the town, employing many of the population. Frederick Pennington became a Liberal MP and supporter of many women&#x27;s causes; Pennington&#x27;s daughter Maria married Thomas Thomasson, the philanthropist, and another daughter was the mother of the suffragette Ursula Mellor Bright who married Jacob Bright son of the famous orator John Bright.

<text>Rear Admiral Napoleon Collins (4 March 1814 – 9 August 1875) served in the United States Navy during the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Collins was born in Pennsylvania. He became a midshipman in the United States Navy in January 1834. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1846, he took an active role in the war with Mexico. During the first years of the Civil War, he commanded several gunboats and attained the rank of commander in July 1862.

On 7 October 1864, while in command of the screw sloop , Collins took his ship into a neutral harbor and captured the Confederate cruiser , sparking a minor diplomatic crisis between the United States and the Empire of Brazil. The &quot;Florida&quot; was ultimately towed to sea and taken to the United States.

Court-martialled for this illegal undertaking, Commander Collins was sentenced to be dismissed. However, since his seizure of &quot;Florida&quot; was both militarily effective and popularly acclaimed in the Northern states, the sentence was not carried out.

Napoleon Collins remained active in the post-war Navy, reaching the ranks of captain in July 1866 and rear admiral in August 1874. On 9 August 1875, while in command of the South Pacific Squadron, he died at Lima, Peru.

<doc id="1212103" wikidata="Q2046463" url="?curid=1212103" title="Pains and Penalties Bill 1820">
<text>The Pains and Penalties Bill 1820 was a bill introduced to the British Parliament in 1820, at the request of King George IV, which aimed to dissolve his marriage to Caroline of Brunswick, and deprive her of the title of queen.

George and Caroline had married in 1795, when George was still Prince of Wales. After the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, they separated. Caroline eventually went to live abroad, where she appointed Bartolomeo Pergami to her household as a courier. He eventually rose to become the head servant of her household, and it was widely rumoured that they were lovers.

In 1820, George ascended the throne and Caroline travelled to London to assert her rights as queen of Great Britain and Ireland. George despised her and was adamant that he wanted a divorce. Under English law, however, divorce was not then possible unless one of the parties was guilty of adultery. As neither he nor Caroline would admit to adultery, George had a bill introduced to Parliament, which if passed would declare Caroline to have committed adultery and grant the King a divorce. In essence, the reading of the bill was a public trial of the Queen, with the members of the House of Lords acting as judge and jury.

After a sensational debate in the Lords, which was heavily reported in the press in salacious detail, the bill was narrowly passed by the upper house. However, because the margin was so slim and public unrest over the bill was significant, the government withdrew the bill before it was debated by the House of Commons, as the likelihood of it ever passing there was remote. The incident became known as the Trial of Queen Caroline.

==Background==
In 1795, George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George III, married Duchess Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. They separated after the birth of their only child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, the following year. Caroline eventually departed England for the European mainland. On the death of George III on 29 January 1820, George became king as George IV, and Caroline became queen consort. However, George IV refused to recognise Caroline as queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. Her name was omitted from the liturgy of the Church of England, and George acted to exclude her at every opportunity. In June, Caroline returned to London to assert her rights as queen consort of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

George despised her, and over the preceding few years had collected evidence to support his contention that Caroline had committed adultery while abroad with Bartolomeo Pergami, the head servant of her household. The day after her return to England, George submitted the evidence to the Houses of Parliament in two green bags. The contents of the bags were identical; one copy was presented to the House of Lords by the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, and the other was presented to the House of Commons by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Castlereagh. Each requested that the Houses set up a confidential enquiry to examine the contents of the bags. Replying to Castlereagh in the Commons, Caroline&#x27;s chief attorney, Henry Brougham, demanded that the papers be publicly disclosed. Brougham was in the opposition Whig party and knew that public sympathy rested with Caroline, rather than her husband or the government, which was weak and unpopular. Disclosure of George&#x27;s own adulterous affairs, or even his scandalous and unlawful previous marriage to Maria Fitzherbert, could destabilise the Tory government led by Lord Liverpool.

In an attempt to construct a compromise, Castlereagh and the Duke of Wellington met Brougham and Caroline&#x27;s solicitor Thomas Denman. William Wilberforce secured time for negotiation by persuading the Commons to adjourn the debate on the bags. However, the negotiations were fruitless; the government offered Caroline £50,000 a year to live abroad as a Duchess, but Caroline insisted on her right to be Queen and dismissed the money as a bribe. Wilberforce moved a motion in the House of Commons requesting that Caroline not insist on all her claims, which was passed by a wide margin of 394 votes to 124. However, the public was still solidly behind Caroline, and she rejected Wilberforce&#x27;s request. George Canning, who may have been a former lover of Caroline, threatened to resign from the government in protest at the proceedings against her. If Canning resigned, the government would almost certainly fall. In the end, either he was persuaded not to resign or his resignation was refused. His eldest son had recently died and, rather than be involved in the debate, Canning left Britain on a tour of Europe to recover from his grief.

On 27 June, the Lords rejected a motion made by the Whig leader Lord Grey to abandon the investigation, and the bags were opened and examined by a committee of fifteen peers. A week later, the chair of the committee, Lord Harrowby, reported back to the Lords. The committee decided that the evidence was of such a grave and serious nature that it should be the subject of a &quot;legislative proceeding&quot;. In reply, Lord Liverpool announced that a bill would be introduced the following day.

==Bill==
On 5 July, a bill was introduced into Parliament &quot;to deprive Her Majesty Queen Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of the Title, Prerogatives, Rights, Privileges, and Exemptions of Queen Consort of this Realm; and to dissolve the Marriage between His Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia Elizabeth&quot;. The bill charged that Caroline had committed adultery with Bartolomeo Pergami, &quot;a foreigner of low station&quot;, and that consequently she had forfeited her rights to be queen consort.

The debate on the bill was effectively a public trial of the Queen, during which the government could call witnesses against her who could be cross-examined by her own legal advisors. By voting on the bill, members of the Houses of Parliament would be both jury and judges. Caroline would not receive basic rights accorded to other defendants; for example, she would not be informed of who the witnesses were before they were called. It was, said &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, &quot;a violation of the law of God&quot;. The British people seemed to be on Caroline&#x27;s side and gave her strong support.

George lived a hugely extravagant life on the taxes collected by Parliament, whereas Caroline appeared to live modestly. Satirists and cartoonists published prints in support of Caroline and depicted George as debauched and licentious. She received messages of support from all over the country. Caroline was a figurehead for the growing radical movement that demanded political reform and opposed the unpopular George. By August, Caroline had allied with radical campaigners such as William Cobbett, and it was probably Cobbett who wrote these words of Caroline&#x27;s:
The day before the trial was due to start, an open letter from Caroline to George, again probably written by Cobbett, was published widely. In it, she decried the injustices against her, claimed she was the victim of conspiracy and intrigue, accused George of heartlessness and cruelty, and demanded a fair trial. The letter was seen as a challenge, not only to George but to the government and the forces resisting reform.

==Trial==
On 17 August 1820, the trial opened. Amid a large military presence, crowds gathered to watch the peers and the Queen attend Parliament. Once in their chamber, the Lords began the bill&#x27;s second reading (the first reading was a formality). Lord Chancellor Lord Eldon, acting as the Speaker of the House, noted the absence of several peers, notably Lords Byron and Erskine, because they were either abroad or too elderly to attend. Caroline&#x27;s brother-in-law, Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex, asked to be excused from participating on the grounds of consanguinity. His request was granted, though his brother, Prince Frederick, Duke of York, announced that he would continue to attend.

The first motion was moved by the Duke of Leinster, to the effect that the bill be dismissed. It was an initial test of the government&#x27;s strength that would gauge support for the King. The motion was lost by 206–41. During the first day and the next, opening speeches by Caroline&#x27;s defence team, Henry Brougham and Thomas Denman, were well received. In their speeches, Brougham and Denman hinted but did not state explicitly, referring only to &quot;recrimination&quot;, that George could come off worse because of the bill if his own infidelities (such as his secret marriage to Maria Fitzherbert) were revealed in the course of the debate. In private, the Queen also turned the tables on the King by saying she &quot;never committed adultery but once, and that was with Mrs Fitzherbert&#x27;s husband&quot;.
The prosecution case, led by the Attorney General for England and Wales Sir Robert Gifford, began on Saturday 19 August. The Queen did not attend. Gifford claimed that Caroline and Pergami had lived as lovers for five years from November 1814. He asserted that they shared a bedroom, were seen in each other&#x27;s presence arm-in-arm, and were heard kissing. The Queen, he stated, changed clothes in front of Pergami and ate her meals with him. He said that Pergami was a married man, but although his child, sister, mother and brother lived in the Queen&#x27;s household, his wife did not. The Sunday newspapers the following morning were filled with the salacious details of Gifford&#x27;s speech. Gifford resumed his attack on Monday 21 August by recounting further outrageous revelations: Pergami and Caroline had been seen together on a bed in a state of undress; she had sat on Pergami&#x27;s knee in public; she had taken baths accompanied only by Pergami. High society did not receive the speech well. They were appalled at Caroline&#x27;s behaviour, but they were more appalled at George&#x27;s. By forcing the details of Caroline&#x27;s life into the public arena, George had damaged the monarchy and endangered the political &quot;status quo&quot;. Leigh Hunt wrote to Percy Bysshe Shelley, &quot;The whole thing will be one of the greatest pushes given to the declining royalty that the age has seen.&quot;

The first witness for the prosecution was an Italian servant, Theodore Majocchi. The prosecution&#x27;s reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian sentiment in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs, and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal. Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury. After Gifford&#x27;s speech on 21 August, Caroline entered the chamber of the House of Lords. Shortly afterwards, Majocchi was called. As he was led in, Caroline rose and advanced towards him, flinging back her veil. She apparently recognised him, exclaimed &quot;Theodore!&quot;, and rushed out of the House. Her sudden sensational departure was seen as a &quot;burst of agony&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;, but others thought it the mark of a guilty conscience. It led her defence team to advise her against attending in future, unless specifically requested. Indeed, the evidence was so demeaning that the Queen did usually absent herself from the chamber, though she went to the House of Lords. According to Princess Lieven, Caroline passed the time by playing backgammon in a side-room.

==Prosecution case==

Under examination by the Solicitor General for England and Wales, John Singleton Copley, Majocchi testified that Caroline and Pergami ate breakfast together, had adjoining bedrooms, and had kissed each other on the lips. He said Pergami&#x27;s bed was not always slept in, and he had seen Pergami visit the Queen wearing only underwear and a dressing gown. He said that they had slept in the same tent during a trip around the Mediterranean, and that Pergami had attended the Queen, alone, while she was having a bath. The following day, his astonishing testimony continued with the revelation that when Caroline and Pergami were travelling together in a carriage, Pergami kept a bottle with him so he could relieve himself without having to step down from the coach. The situation in the House became more absurd, as the Solicitor General asked Majocchi about a male exotic dancer employed by Caroline, after which Majocchi demonstrated a dance by pulling up his trousers, extending his arms, clicking his fingers, and shouting &quot;vima dima!&quot;, while moving his body up and down in a suggestive fashion. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper was disgusted and informed its readers that it regretted being &quot;obliged&quot; to report &quot;filth of this kind&quot;. During Brougham&#x27;s cross-examination, Majocchi replied &quot;Non mi ricordo&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t recall&quot;) more than two hundred times. The phrase was repeated so often, it became a national joke, and featured in cartoons and parodies. Majocchi&#x27;s credibility as a witness was destroyed.

The next witness was ship&#x27;s mate Gaetano Paturzo, who claimed that he had seen Caroline sitting on Pergami&#x27;s lap, but nothing more, while on a Mediterranean cruise. Ship&#x27;s master Vincenzo Garguilo testified that Caroline and Pergami had shared a tent on deck and had kissed. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he had been paid to give evidence, but said that the payment was lower in value than the business he had lost through coming to England. Captain Thomas Briggs of HMS &quot;Leviathan&quot;, another vessel used by Caroline and Pergami during their journey, was also called as a prosecution witness. He said that the two had adjoining cabins on board and he had seen them arm-in-arm. Unlike the Italian witnesses, as an Englishman of some substance, the Lords considered Captain Briggs to be a more credible witness. After the conclusion of the cross-examination, however, Lord Ellenborough rose and asked Briggs directly, &quot;Did the witness see any improper familiarity between the Princess and Pergami? Had you any reason to suspect any improper freedom or familiarity between them?&quot; &quot;No&quot;, replied Briggs.

A further witness, Pietro Cuchi, an innkeeper in Trieste, told the Lords that he had spied on the couple through a keyhole, during which he thought he saw Pergami leave the Queen&#x27;s bedroom wearing stockings, pantaloons and a dressing gown. However, he could not be sure because his view, through the keyhole, was restricted. He did say that Pergami&#x27;s bed was not slept in, and that both chamber pots in Caroline&#x27;s room were used.

As Princess Lieven observed, the trial was a &quot;solemn farce&quot;. On 25 August, a German chambermaid from Karlsruhe, Barbara Kress, was sworn in. She was asked about the sheets on the Queen&#x27;s bed: &quot;Did you at any time see anything on the sheets?&quot;, asked Gifford. Kress&#x27;s response was spoken quietly. Two interpreters, one for the King and one for the Queen, formed a huddle around her. The Queen&#x27;s interpreter claimed the word &quot;wuste&quot; was not translatable; the King&#x27;s interpreter was asked to press Kress for a further explanation. She broke down, and the proceedings were paused to allow her to regain composure. An eventual translation of &quot;stains&quot; was agreed. Tory Harriet Arbuthnot wrote in her journal &quot;if the Whig Lords do not consider the disgusting details they have heard &quot;proof&quot;, the Whig ladies may in future consider themselves very secure against divorces.&quot;

Caroline&#x27;s former maid, Louise Demont, testified she had seen Caroline leave Pergami&#x27;s bedroom wearing only a nightdress, and corroborated previous evidence that Caroline and Pergami had shared a tent and a bath during the cruise. She was also asked about stains on the bed-sheets, but refused to be drawn into details because it was &quot;not decent&quot;. Under cross-examination, she was accused of living in England for more than a year under the assumed name of &quot;Countess Colombier&quot;. Demont&#x27;s flustered reply mimicked those of Majocchi, as she claimed she could not recall being called by that name. The defence said she had been sacked for lying, and produced a letter written by Demont in which she admitted coming to England on a &quot;false pretence&quot;. Demont&#x27;s sister, Mariette Brun, had remained in Caroline&#x27;s service as a maid, and had passed information on her sister to Caroline&#x27;s defence team.

The procession of witnesses continued; a mason, Luigi Galdini, claimed he had stumbled across Pergami holding Caroline&#x27;s bare breast in their Italian villa. Coachman Giuseppe Sacchi, who was Demont&#x27;s lover, claimed that he had found the couple asleep in a carriage in each other&#x27;s arms, with Caroline&#x27;s hand on Pergami&#x27;s undone breeches. Sacchi&#x27;s testimony was ridiculed in the British press, as &quot;the parties being asleep, such a position in a carriage, where the bodies are themselves upright, or nearly so, is beyond all question absolutely and physically impossible&quot;.

==Defence case==

In a letter to the King, the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool summarised the progress of the trial. He said the evidence had made an impression in the House, but the bill was by no means secure. The Queen was still immensely popular. Over 800 petitions totalling nearly a million signatures were received in her favour. Liverpool warned the King that Majocchi and Demont were discredited as witnesses, and the evidence produced by the defence could damage George severely. The divorce clause was especially unpopular, he wrote, though it might pass the Lords, it would not pass the Commons. He suggested that it be dropped. George would not decide to do so.

After the presentation of the prosecution case, the trial was adjourned for three weeks, and the Queen&#x27;s solicitor, Denman, visited Cheltenham Spa for a break. Once his identity was discovered, a supportive crowd gathered outside his lodgings. Meanwhile, Caroline&#x27;s defence team assembled their evidence. Letters exchanged between them and Italian correspondents show that Colonel Carlo Vassalli, Caroline&#x27;s equerry, said there was nothing improper between Caroline and Pergami. Caroline shared a room with Victorine, Pergami&#x27;s daughter, and Caroline&#x27;s behaviour with Pergami was no different than with other men. Interviewed in Pesaro, Pergami himself was prepared to swear that his bed was not slept in because he was sleeping with Demont, and that he had never had &quot;an intercourse with the Queen&quot;.

The defence opened on 3 October, with a speech from Brougham. His speech was considered the &quot;most magnificent display of argument and oratory that has been heard in years&quot;, &quot;one of the most powerful orations that ever proceeded from human lips&quot;, and &quot;one of the most magnificent speeches ever made in this or any other country&quot;. According to Thomas Creevey, it astonished and shook the aristocracy. In it, Brougham threatened to reveal facts about George&#x27;s own life, even if they damaged the country, if it was the only way to ensure justice for his client. He attacked the character of the prosecution witnesses, and claimed that Italian witnesses could be purchased like a commodity. He read from a letter from an Italian correspondent, &quot;There is nothing at Naples so notorious as the free and public sale of false evidence. Their ordinary tariff is three or four ducats.&quot; He reminded the Lords that Majocchi was forgetful, that Demont was a liar, and that Cuchi was a lecherous wretch who spied on his female guests through a keyhole. He produced a letter from George to Caroline written in 1796, which became known as the &quot;letter of licence&quot;. It appeared to forgive any transgressions on either Caroline or his part, and allow them to lead separate lives. &quot;Our inclinations are not in our power,&quot; George had written, &quot;nor should either of us be held accountable to the other.&quot;

The defence witnesses included Lord Guilford, Lord Glenbervie, Lady Charlotte Lindsay, Lord Landaff, The Hon. Keppel Craven, Sir William Gell, Henry Holland, Colonel Alessandro Olivieri, and Carlo Vassalli, all of whom swore that there was nothing unusual about Caroline&#x27;s behaviour. The King was incensed; &quot;I never thought that I should have lived to witness so much prevarication, so much lying, and so much wilful and convenient forgetfulness&quot;, he wrote. Under cross-examination, Lord Guilford was unable to recall leaving a handsome Greek servant alone with Caroline for three-quarters of an hour, and Lady Charlotte had on occasion said &quot;I do not recollect&quot;, but without the same disdain that had met Majocchi&#x27;s constant refrain of &quot;non mi ricordo&quot;. British servants who had been in Caroline&#x27;s household, including Keppel&#x27;s valet John Whitcomb, also testified in Caroline&#x27;s favour. Whitcomb admitted that he had slept with Demont, who was already known to have slept with the coachman Sacchi, thus further ruining Demont&#x27;s tarnished reputation. A French milliner, Fanchette Martigner, further testified that Demont had told her that Caroline was innocent, and the charges against her &quot;were nothing but calumnies invented by her enemies in order to ruin her&quot;.

The trial seemed to be going Caroline&#x27;s way, especially after Sacchi&#x27;s testimony was refuted by the nephew of the Duchess of Torlonia, Carlo Forti. Forti claimed that the Countess Oldi (Pergami&#x27;s sister) sat between Caroline and Pergami in the carriage, which was also shared with Victorine (Pergami&#x27;s daughter), and so there could have been no intimacy between them. However, the cross-examination of two of the witnesses damaged Caroline&#x27;s case. Lieutenant John Flynn and Joseph Hownam had both been on the same Mediterranean cruise with Caroline and Pergami. Flynn said nothing incriminating but during the course of the cross-examination, he fainted, which left a bad impression. Pressed by Gifford, Hownam admitted that Caroline and Pergami had both slept in the same tent on deck because, he claimed, Caroline was afraid of pirates, and wanted a guard in the tent with her. In an attempt to regain ground, Brougham produced two Italian witnesses, Giuseppe Giroline and Filippo Pomi, who revealed that the prosecution witnesses had been paid 40 francs each, and given free food and board. The Whigs now claimed that the trial was tainted as there was &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by paying witnesses for their testimony. Lord Liverpool countered Whig demands to abandon the bill by saying that there was other evidence, from non-Italian witnesses, that could be relied upon.

Brougham attempted to investigate the claim of conspiracy further in the hope that it would discover the man behind the conspiracy, who paid for the witnesses and hired the prosecution team. Disingenuously referring to &quot;this mysterious being, this retiring phantom, this uncertain shape&quot; (quoting Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;), Brougham knew full well that &quot;this uncertain shape&quot; was the King. The King knew it too, and took Brougham&#x27;s words to be a direct reference to his massive size, as the King was vastly overweight. The Tories challenged Brougham&#x27;s line of questioning, as they claimed it implicated persons who could not be called as witnesses, and widened the investigation beyond the relevance of the bill.

==Passed but withdrawn==
For ten hours over two days, Thomas Denman summed up for the defence. He cited the dishonesty of the principal prosecution witnesses, the evidence of the defence witnesses that contradicted that of the prosecution, and drew parallels between George and the Roman emperor Nero. He said Nero had banished his wife, Claudia Octavia, and taken a mistress in her place. He had then concocted a conspiracy to dethrone, degrade and divorce her, before she was ultimately condemned and killed. A second member of the defence team, Stephen Lushington, then spoke for a shorter time to highlight the main points of the defence case. In concluding the prosecution, Gifford reiterated the claims of Demont and Majocchi, and claimed that they were &quot;undeniable proof of her Majesty&#x27;s guilt&quot;.
The Lords proceeded to debate the bill. The Whig leader Lord Grey complained that the bill was far removed from ordinary legal practice, and pointed out that, if the Lords passed the bill, the entire process would have to be repeated in the Commons, leading to more public strife. Furthermore, the evidence was insufficient, tainted or contradicted. Even if Caroline had shown Pergami favour, it was within the power of royalty to elevate anyone from a low rank to a high one, and it was a strength of society that any person could rise from the lowest of births to the highest of offices. Indeed, Caroline and Pergami had lived at Naples, where the King himself (Joachim Murat) had risen from humble origins. They had travelled through countries that through the influence of the French Revolution had seen the reversal of traditional power structures, with the once-wealthy laid low, and the obscure propelled to distinction.

The vote was held on 6 November 1820, three years to the day since Caroline&#x27;s only daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, had died. Each peer rose and said either &quot;content&quot;, indicating support for the bill, or &quot;not content&quot;, to oppose it. The vote was 123–95 in favour. Though the majority was 28, it was considered a narrow victory. Eleven &quot;content&quot; votes were from the bishops who sat in the House of Lords, while many &quot;not content&quot; votes were from the richest and most powerful peers. As seats in the House of Commons were often controlled by rich and powerful landowners, it meant that the Commons were almost certain to reject the bill. Consequently, over the next few days the Lords debated dropping the divorce clause, but the Whigs had spotted a tactical opportunity. Lord Grey now spoke in favour of retaining the divorce clause, since by doing so it made the bill more likely to fail in the Commons. On 10 November, a final reading of the bill took place, and a further vote was held. The bill passed by 108–99, with a majority of 9.

In a highly emotional state, the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool rose to address the House. He declared that since the vote was so close, and public tensions so high, the government was withdrawing the bill.

==Aftermath==
The Queen considered it a victory. Crowds of Londoners celebrated exuberantly in the streets; the windows of government supporters were smashed, and the offices of newspapers that had supported the King were set alight. Similar scenes occurred throughout the United Kingdom. On 29 November, Caroline attended a service of thanksgiving at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with the Lord Mayor of London, much to the dismay of the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s. Vast crowds turned out to see her; estimates of the number in the crowd vary between 50,000 and 500,000. Nevertheless, she was still barred from George&#x27;s coronation at Westminster Abbey on 19 July 1821. She fell ill and died three weeks later. Her husband did not attend her funeral, and her body was returned to Brunswick for burial.

With the failure of the bill, the radicals largely lost Caroline as a figurehead of the reform movement, since they were stripped of a cause and Caroline had no further need of them as allies. Once the scandal had died down, the loyalist pro-King party had a resurgence, and became more vocal. It took over a decade and the death of King George IV, for the reform movement to gain sufficient ground to force through Parliament the Reform Act 1832, which regulated the franchise throughout the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1212105" wikidata="Q4812455" url="?curid=1212105" title="At sixes and sevens">
<text>&quot;At sixes and sevens&quot; is an English idiom used to describe a condition of confusion or disarray.

==Origin and early history==
It is not known for certain, but the most likely origin of the phrase is the dice game &quot;hazard&quot;, a more complicated version of the modern game of craps. 

Michael Quinion, a British etymologist, writing on his website on linguistics, says, &quot;It is thought that the expression was originally &quot;to set on cinque and sice&quot; (from the French numerals for five and six). These were apparently the most risky numbers to shoot for (&#x27;to set on&#x27;) and anyone who tried for them was considered careless or confused.&quot;

A similar phrase, &quot;to set the world on six and seven&quot;, is used by Geoffrey Chaucer in his &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. It dates from the mid-1380s and seems from its context to mean &quot;to hazard the world&quot; or &quot;to risk one&#x27;s life&quot;. William Shakespeare uses a similar phrase in &quot;Richard II&quot; (around 1595), &quot;But time will not permit: all is uneven, And every thing is left at six and seven&quot;.

Quinion notes a false but &quot;widely believed&quot; story on &quot;where the phrase at sixes and sevens came from, and what it really means&quot;. It is sometimes said to derive from a dispute between two City of London trade guilds or livery companies–The Merchant Taylors Company and the Skinners Company. The two argued over sixth place in the order of precedence. In 1484, the Lord Mayor of London Sir Robert Billesden decided that the companies would swap between sixth and seventh place on an annual basis. This story is disproved as a source, according to Quinion, by the &quot;brute force of the evidence&quot; that the phrase was in use and that it occurred in Chaucer a century before the trade guild dispute was decided.

== Later use ==
In a public debate in June 1877 the former secularist, communist, spiritualist and then reconvert, the Rev. Dr. George Sexton (1825-1898), used the phrase in a debate with the secularist G. W. Foote to describe the current state of Secularism in England: 
“And I can show you by extracts from the writings of the leading men that there is no single point upon which they are agreed; that they are all at sixes and sevens one with another- (laughter)..” 

The phrase is used in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1878), where Captain Corcoran, the ship&#x27;s Commander, is confused as to what choices to make in his life, and exclaims in the opening song of Act II, &quot;Fair moon, to thee I sing, bright regent of the heavens, say, why is everything either at sixes or at sevens?&quot;

In H. G. Wells&#x27; preface to his &quot;The Outline of History&quot; (1919), entitled &quot;The Story and Aim of the Outline of History&quot;, he writes: &quot;All the people who were interested in these league of nations projects were at sixes and sevens among themselves because they had the most vague, heterogenous and untidy assumptions about what the world of men was, what it had been, and therefore of what it could be.&quot;

In chapter three of the 1926 &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers the maid, Ellen, says, &quot;Anyhow, it was all at sixes and sevens for a day or two, and then her ladyship shuts herself up in her room and won&#x27;t let me go into her wardrobe.&quot;

The phrase occurs in Sabina&#x27;s opening monologue from Thornton Wilder&#x27;s 1942 Pulitzer Prize winning play &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth:&quot; &quot;The whole world&#x27;s at sixes and sevens, and why the house hasn&#x27;t fallen down about our ears long ago is a miracle to me.&quot;

== Modern use ==

In &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963) by John Fowles, Clegg says, &quot;she had me all at sixes and sevens that evening&quot;.

The phrase appears in a few songs, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; from the musical &quot;Evita;&quot; &quot;Happy Endings&quot; from the 1977 film &quot;New York, New York&quot;; &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; from Tears for Fears; and &quot;Playing With Fire&quot; by Stereo MCs. The eleventh studio album from Strange Music front man Tech N9ne was entitled &quot;All 6&#x27;s and 7&#x27;s&quot;. The song &quot;Sixes and Sevens&quot; was cowritten and sung by Robert Plant. It also appears in the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; (&quot;sixes and sevens and nines&quot;).

The phrase is also used in the 1978 movie &quot;The Wiz&quot;, when Miss One gives Dorothy the silver slippers and comments, &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t be all sixes and sevens, honey&quot; to Dorothy as Dorothy is in a state of confusion after killing the Wicked Witch of the East. In the movie Shaft, starring Richard Roundtree, a blind newspaper vendor replies with “Same old sixes and sevens”. It is also found in the 1993 film &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;. It is also mentioned in the 2002 film &quot;Goldmember&quot; by Mike Myers&#x27; character Austin Powers to his dad, who at the time were speaking &quot;English English&quot;: &quot;oh, the one who was all sixes and sevens?&quot; In the third episode of season one of The Sopranos, Carmela states that her anxiety over planning a fundraiser has her &quot;at sixes and sevens.&quot; During the second episode of season five of the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, George uses the phrase to describe his wife&#x27;s attitude towards him. In the Oscar nominated film &quot;Mank&quot;, Marion Davies uses the phrase to describe her mental state.

<text>The Good Doctor is a comedy with music written by Neil Simon. It consists of a series of short plays, based on short stories and other works of Russian writer Anton Chekhov, framed by a writer making comments on them.

==Productions==
&quot;The Good Doctor&quot; opened on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on November 27, 1973, and closed on May 25, 1974, after 208 performances and eight previews. Produced by Emanuel Azenberg and directed by A.J. Antoon, it starred René Auberjonois, Barnard Hughes, Marsha Mason, Christopher Plummer, and Frances Sternhagen.

Frances Sternhagen won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and the play received three additional Tony Award nominations: Best Original Score (Peter Link and Neil Simon), Best Featured Actor in a Play (René Auberjonois), and Best Lighting Design (Tharon Musser). Clive Barnes wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;There is much fun here-or at least here and there. It is, however, too anecdotal, with most stories closing with the dramatic ring of a punch-line. Mr. Simon&#x27;s comic fancy is admirable.&quot;

Simon met his second wife, Marsha Mason during auditions for this play.

A revival was produced by The Melting Pot Theater, at the Theater of the Riverside Church, New York City, from February 1998 through March 1, 1998, with Andre De Shields, Jane Connell, and Gordon Connell.

A television movie was made based on the play, with Edward Asner, Richard Chamberlain, and Marsha Mason. It premiered on PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances&quot; on November 8, 1978. Reviewer John O&#x27;Connor wrote, &quot;Mr. Simon also includes a special piece for his wife, Marsha Mason, in which the appealing actress gets to play each of &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; ... . A press release notes that it is difficult to tell where Chekov stops and Simon begins. That&#x27;s part of the problem ... . The result falls awkwardly between gentle Chekhovian satire and clever Simon wisecracks. Neither writer is served to advantage.&quot;

==Plot overview==
An unnamed writer (obviously meant to represent Chekhov himself) suffers from writer&#x27;s block and his own artistic temperament as he narrates to the audience several of his stories:
* &quot;The Sneeze&quot; (based on &quot;The Death of a Government Clerk&quot;) - A government clerk over-apologizes and has a nervous breakdown after accidentally sneezing on a general during a night out at the opera.
* &quot;The Governess&quot; (based on &quot;The Nincompoop&quot;) - A mother attempts to cheat her children&#x27;s governess out of her pay by making up offenses and damages for which the governess must &quot;compensate&quot; but then tells her it was a test to see if she would stand up for herself, she did not.
* &quot;Surgery&quot; (based on the eponymous title) - A sexton visits the dentist complaining of a toothache, but the dentist&#x27;s zeal for his profession begins to frighten his patient.
* &quot;Too Late for Happiness&quot; - An older man and woman contemplate making time for each other in song.
* &quot;The Seduction&quot; - A renowned seducer of married women sets his sights on his best friend&#x27;s wife, using his friend as an unwitting accomplice in the ploy.
* &quot;The Drowned Man&quot; - An entrepreneurial tramp pretends to drown himself to make money, calling what he does &quot;maritime entertainment&quot;.
* &quot;The Audition&quot; - An actress who walked four days from Odessa to Moscow to audition for the Writer&#x27;s next play uses most of her audition time to gush over the Writer.
* &quot;A Defenseless Creature&quot; - A woman with a nervous disorder harasses an ill banker to extort money for her injured husband.
* &quot;The Arrangement&quot; - In flashback, the Writer&#x27;s father takes his shy 19-year-old son to a brothel to make him a man.
* &quot;A Quiet War&quot; (optional scene) - Two retired military commanders meet in the park to debate what makes the perfect five-course lunch.

<text>Années de pèlerinage (French for Years of Pilgrimage) (S.160, S.161, S.162, S.163) is a set of three suites for solo piano by Franz Liszt. Much of it derives from his earlier work, &quot;Album d&#x27;un voyageur&quot;, his first major published piano cycle, which was composed between 1835 and 1838 and published in 1842. &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; is widely considered as the masterwork and summation of Liszt&#x27;s musical style. The third volume is notable as an example of his later style. Composed well after the first two volumes, it displays less virtuosity and more harmonic experimentation.

The title &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot; refers to Goethe&#x27;s famous novel of self-realization, &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;, and especially its sequel &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Journeyman Years&quot; (whose original title &quot;Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre&quot; meant &quot;Years of Wandering&quot; or &quot;Years of Pilgrimage&quot;, the latter being used for its first French translation). Liszt clearly places these compositions in line with the Romantic literature of his time, prefacing most pieces with a literary passage from writers such as Schiller, Byron or Senancour, and, in an introduction to the entire work, writing: 

==The suites==

===Première année: Suisse===

&quot;Première année: Suisse&quot; (&quot;First Year: Switzerland&quot;), S.160, was published in 1855. Composed between 1848 and 1854, most of the pieces (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9) are revisions of &quot;Album d&#x27;un voyageur: Part 1: Impressions et Poesies&quot;. &quot;Au lac de Wallenstadt&quot; (No. 2) and &quot;Au bord d&#x27;une source&quot; (No. 4) received only minor revisions, while &quot;La Chapelle de Guillaume Tell&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Vallée d&#x27;Obermann&quot; (No. 6), and especially &quot;Les cloches de Genève&quot; (No. 9) were more extensively rewritten. &quot;Églogue&quot; (No. 7) was published separately, and &quot;Orage&quot; (No. 5) was included as part of the definitive version of the cycle.

# &quot;Chapelle de Guillaume Tell&quot; (William Tell&#x27;s Chapel) in C major – For this depiction of the Swiss struggle for liberation Liszt chooses a motto from Schiller as caption, &quot;All for one – one for all.&quot; A noble passage marked lento opens the piece, followed by the main melody of the freedom fighters. A horn call rouses the troops, echoes down the valleys, and mixes with the sound of the heroic struggle.
# &quot;Au lac de Wallenstadt&quot; (At Lake Wallenstadt) in A major – Liszt&#x27;s caption is from Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; (Canto III, stanza 85): &quot;Thy contrasted lake / With the wild world I dwell in is a thing / Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake / Earth&#x27;s troubled waters for a purer spring.&quot; In her &quot;Mémoires&quot;, Liszt&#x27;s mistress and traveling companion of the time, Marie d&#x27;Agoult, recalls their time by Lake Wallenstadt, writing, &quot;Franz wrote for me there a melancholy harmony, imitative of the sigh of the waves and the cadence of oars, which I have never been able to hear without weeping.&quot;
# &quot;Pastorale&quot; in E major – 
# &quot;Au bord d&#x27;une source&quot; (Beside a Spring) in A major – Liszt&#x27;s caption is from Schiller: “In the whispering coolness begins young nature&#x27;s play.”
# &quot;Orage&quot; (Storm) in C minor – Liszt&#x27;s caption is again from Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; (Canto III, canto 96): &quot;But where of ye, O tempests! is the goal? / Are ye like those within the human breast? / Or do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?&quot;
# &quot;Vallée d&#x27;Obermann&quot; (Obermann&#x27;s Valley) in E minor – Inspired by Étienne Pivert de Senancour&#x27;s novel of the same title, set in Switzerland, with a hero overwhelmed and confused by nature, suffering from ennui and longing, finally concluding that only our feelings are true. The captions include one from Byron&#x27;s succeeding canto 97, (&quot;Could I embody and unbosom now / That which is most within me,--could I wreak / My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw / Soul--heart--mind--passions--feelings--strong or weak-- / All that I would have sought, and all I seek, / Bear, know, feel--and yet breathe--into one word, / And that one word were Lightning, I would speak; / But as it is, I live and die unheard, / With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword&quot;) and two from Senancour&#x27;s &quot;Obermann,&quot; which include the crucial questions, “What do I want? Who am I? What do I ask of nature?&quot;
# &quot;Eglogue&quot; (Eclogue) in A major – Liszt&#x27;s caption is from the next canto of the &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;: &quot;The morn is up again, the dewy morn, / With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom, / Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn, / And living as if earth contained no tomb!&quot; 
# &quot;Le mal du pays&quot; (Homesickness) in E minor – 
# &quot;Les cloches de Genève: Nocturne&quot; (The Bells of Geneva: Nocturne) in B major – Liszt&#x27;s caption is from stanza 72, earlier in the Byron&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;: “I live not in myself, but I become / Portion of that around me”.

===Deuxième année: Italie===

&quot;Deuxième année: Italie&quot; (&quot;Second Year: Italy&quot;), S.161, was composed between 1837 and 1849 and published in 1858 by Schott. Nos. 4 to 6 are revisions of &quot;Tre sonetti del Petrarca&quot; (Three sonnets of Petrarch), which was composed around 1839–1846 and published in 1846.
# &quot;Sposalizio&quot; (Marriage of the Virgin, a painting by Raphael) in E major
# &quot;Il penseroso&quot; (The Thinker, a statue by Michelangelo) in C minor
# &quot;Canzonetta del Salvator Rosa&quot; (Canzonetta of Salvator Rosa) in A major (Note: this song &quot;Vado ben spesso cangiando loco&quot; was in fact written by Giovanni Bononcini)

* &quot;Venezia e Napoli&quot; (Venice and Naples), S.162. Composed in 1859 as a partial revision of an earlier set with the same name composed around 1840. Published in 1861 as a supplement to the Second Year
# &quot;Gondoliera&quot; (Gondolier&#x27;s Song) in F major – Based on the song &quot;La biondina in gondoletta&quot; by Giovanni Battista Peruchini.
# &quot;Canzone&quot; (Canzone) in E minor – Based on the gondolier&#x27;s song &quot;Nessun maggior dolore&quot; from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;.
# &quot;Tarantella&quot; (Tarantella) in G minor – Uses themes by Guillaume-Louis Cottrau, 1797–1847.

===Troisième année===

&quot;Troisième année&quot; (&quot;Third Year&quot;), S.163, was published 1883; Nos. 1–4 and 7 composed in 1877; No. 5, 1872; No. 6, 1867.
# &quot;Angélus! Prière aux anges gardiens&quot; (Angelus! Prayer to the Guardian Angels) in E major – dedicated to Daniela von Bülow, Liszt&#x27;s granddaughter, first daughter of Hans von Bülow and Cosima Liszt and wife of art historian Henry Thode. It was written for both melodeon, piano, or an instrument that combines both, for Liszt wrote &quot;piano-melodium&quot; on his manuscript
# &quot;Aux cyprès de la Villa d&#x27;Este I: Thrénodie&quot; (To the Cypresses of the Villa d&#x27;Este I: Threnody) in G minor
# &quot;Aux cyprès de la Villa d&#x27;Este II: Thrénodie&quot; (To the Cypresses of the Villa d&#x27;Este II: Threnody) in E minor – The Villa d&#x27;Este described in these two threnodies is in Tivoli, near Rome. It is famous for its beautiful cypresses and fountains
# &quot;Les jeux d&#x27;eaux à la Villa d&#x27;Este&quot; (The Fountains of the Villa d&#x27;Este) in F major – Over the music, Liszt placed the inscription, &quot;Sed aqua quam ego dabo ei, fiet in eo fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam&quot; (&quot;But the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up into eternal life,&quot; from the Gospel of John). This piece, with its advanced harmonies and shimmering textures, is in many ways a precursor of musical Impressionism 
# &quot;Sunt lacrymae rerum/En mode hongrois&quot; (&quot;There are Tears for Things&quot;/In Hungarian Style) in A minor – Dedicated to Hans von Bülow.
# &quot;Marche funèbre, En mémoire de Maximilien I, Empereur du Mexique&quot; (Funeral March, In memory of Emperor Maximilian of Mexico) in F minor
# &quot;Sursum corda&quot; (Lift Up Your Hearts) in E major

<text>Knighton is a hamlet in the parish of Adbaston in the county of Staffordshire, England.

Knighton is situated north of Newport, Shropshire, close to the Staffordshire/Shropshire border in undulating agricultural land featuring many endemic hardwood trees. Another feature is the Shropshire Union Canal, which passes through the hamlet at the point of a cutting and substantial embankment. Adjacent to the canal is the Knighton Reservoir, the function of which is to replenish its waters. 

Although a fundamentally agricultural community there is a food processing and packaging plant belonging to the food manufacturer Knighton Foods Ltd which processes and packs a wide range of products including Hot Beverages, Instant Desserts, Custards and Whips, Bakery Ingredients, Instant Milks, Coffee Creamers and Fat Powders. The factory maintains a social club, the facilities of which are available to the wider community for social events. The club&#x27;s football pitch is home ground to the amateur Sunday football team Woodseaves FC, from the nearby village of Woodseaves, who play in the Stafford and District Sunday League.

The hamlet of Knighton has a royal decree attached to it, the effect of which is that all denizens shall be free of tax and tythe for ever more. Unfortunately over time this right has been slowly eroded to a point where now only denizens living within Knighton and engaged in agriculture can avail themselves of the rights bestowed by the decree. William Adams, who founded a grammar school at Newport, Shropshire in 1656, endowed this school with a large agricultural estate at Knighton, providing income for future generations; as a result of this Knighton was exempt from all land taxes until 1990. The Knighton estate was eventually sold off in several portions over the course of the twentieth century, and the proceeds of the final sale were used by the Haberdashers&#x27; Company to purchase Longford Hall as a boarding house for the school.

The immediate area has a wealth of fauna and flora, buzzards and ravens often to be seen in the skies, otters have been reported in the areas water courses, deer occasionally to be seen in the surrounding fields and at least one &quot;big cat&quot; has not only been spotted within the parish but has effected a &quot;kill&quot;, the victim being a young lamb.

<doc id="1212132" wikidata="Q737378" url="?curid=1212132" title="Gigi Becali">
<text>George &quot;Gigi&quot; Becali (; born 25 June 1958) is a Romanian businessman, writer and former politician and convict, mostly known for his ownership of the  FCSB football club. 

Becali was a Member of the European Parliament between June 2009 and December 2012, and a Member of the Romanian Parliament from December 2012 up until his conviction in May 2013.

==Early life==
Becali was born in Vădeni, Brăila County, to an Aromanian family which had been deported to the Bărăgan Plain by the Communist authorities because of their associations with the pre-World War II fascist party Iron Guard.

==Entrepreneurship==
===Real estate business===
Becali has become a millionaire through an exchange of land with the Romanian Army, dubbed by the Romanian press as suspicious, as the Army did not need the land it received and the land he received in exchange was worth much more.

The deal consisted of Becali giving the Army a 21.5-hectare plot in Ștefăneștii de Jos (about 15 km from Bucharest) in exchange for a 20.9-hectare plot in Băneasa-Pipera, in Northern Bucharest. As the real estate prices skyrocketed in the capital, he sold the land to some companies that built residential areas.

In 2007, it was revealed that in 1998, when Becali sent the offer to the Romanian Army, he was not the owner of the property in Ștefăneștii de Jos, buying it only after it was clear that the deal would be signed. Also, the Army was not legally allowed to give away the Pipera plot, because it was claimed by former owners.

The affair was investigated in 2006 by the National Anticorruption Directorate (NAD). In July 2007, the NAD started to investigate a transaction between Becali and the daughter of Defence Minister Victor Babiuc, involving land in Pipera which was sold for US$300 per square meter.

===Ownership of FCSB===
Becali joined the General Shareholders&#x27; Council of the Steaua București football team at the end of the 1990s, during the presidency of businessman Viorel Păunescu. Step by step, he tried to eliminate other possible candidates and gather all the club&#x27;s shares. He obtained 51% of the shares on 6 February 2003 and he bought another 15% toward the end of the year 2003.

On October 17, 2005, his entire fortune was impounded by the National Fiscal Authority (ANAF) for debts totaling US$11,000,000. However, Becali sued the ANAF and won the trial, and subsequently the order of seizure was lifted. He was however able to avoid paying the taxes by transferring the assets of Steaua to a newly formed company, AFC Steaua București, allowing the old association to go bankrupt. As of 2007, Becali detains no official link to the club, as he gradually renounced his shares in favour of his nephews.

In 2005, the papers wrote that he commissioned a painting inspired by Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot;, in which he holds the place of Jesus, while the eleven players and the coach hold the place of the disciples. Becali denied the story, claiming that he received the painting from an admirer.

===Managing FCSB===

Gigi Becali was often criticized for interfering with his managers&#x27; work, frequently calling for subs at half time or deciding on the starting XI. Becali admitted this as much, stating that the players are brought with his money, so it is his right to decide who plays and how. Since he was released from prison in 2015, Becali shifted towards appointing puppet managers, without experience, often times close acquaintances or former FCSB icons such as Nicolae Dica, Mirel Radoi, Vergil Andronache, Dinu Todoran and Anton Petrea, often times his main criteria being their religiousness or willingness to be &quot;bossed around&quot; by Becali. One encounter, told by Becali himself, was when Dinu Todoran was considered as manager for the second team. When Becali called him to inform him of the possibility of taking this job, Todoran replied to call him later, stating he is in church. Becali was deeply impressed by the piousness of Todoran that he immediately appointed him manager for the first team. Todoran himself admitted that Becali was managing the team for him, stating that it was no secret who decides the starting XI and the subs, which can be reflected by the fact that he was receiving the lowest salary of any manager in the Romanian League. After a bad spell of form and criticism from the media for his approach, Becali sacked Todoran and decided to not involve himself in football matters anymore, hiring Edi Iordanescu, the manager who won the previous title. Edi immediately turned the team around, and achieved a 9-game undefeated streak, including a 6–0 win over bitter rivals Dinamo Bucharest, in spite of a COVID outbreak at the club. Becali remained silent for a few months, however he started to voice his displeasure at the quality of the game, stating that his team must always have the possession, and that a result based approach is not what interests him. Tensions arose at the club, and ultimately Edi and Becali parted ways on 14 November 2021, after winning 8 games, drawing 2 and losing 2 and taking the team to second place. Gigi Becali announced his intention to return to the team, appointing Pintili as caretaker since he does not have a coaching badge. 

===Other business activities===
Becali announced in 2008 that he intends to open his own bank, named &quot;Becali Bank&quot;, intended to be used &quot;only by millionaires&quot;, with an initial investment of €30 million. Nevertheless, the Administration Council of the National Bank of Romania rejected the plan of creation without giving a public reason. &quot;Cotidianul&quot; notes that the National Bank can reject the creation of a new bank if they suspect that the new bank would not respect the laws or that they won&#x27;t have solid and prudent investment policies.

In reply to this decision, Becali named Mugur Isărescu, the governor of the National Bank, &quot;a buffoon, a frustrated and envious person&quot; and announced that he intends to sue him.

==Political career==

At the 2000 Romanian legislative election, Becali was a candidate of the &quot;League of Italian Communities in Romania&quot; for the seat in the Chamber of Deputies reserved for the Italian minority. He received 16,266 votes (0.15%) countrywide, of which 7,677 in Ilfov County. Nevertheless, he lost to Ileana Stana-Ionescu, who got only 2,943 votes in one constituency. Becali contested the results, but according to Romanian election law, for national minorities, it is not the total number of votes that matters; the individual who gains the largest percentage in one constituency wins the seat reserved for that national minority.

He has led the New Generation – Christian Democrat Party (PNG-CD) since January 2004, being its candidate in the 2004 presidential election, receiving 1.77% of votes cast (184,560 votes).

In his 2004 electoral campaign, Becali used clips of the movie &quot;Mihai Viteazul&quot; movie (directed by Sergiu Nicolaescu), whose main character was played by Amza Pellea. Amza&#x27;s daughter, Oana Pellea, sued Becali for using Amza Pellea&#x27;s image without permission and won 35,000 lei (about US$12,000) in damages.

He often had disputes with Corneliu Vadim Tudor, another extremist politician. These disputes, usually consisted of exchanges of insults between the two. He had another dispute with Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu whom he named a &quot;cockroach-politician&quot; and a &quot;Very Important &quot;Papagal&quot;&quot; (&quot;papagal&quot; means &quot;parrot&quot; in Romanian and is regarded as an insult).

In December 2006, he promised that his party would generate a &quot;Cultural revolution&quot; in Romania.

At the elections for the European Parliament, held in November 2007, his party (PNG-CD) obtained 4.86% of the popular vote, just under the 5% needed for admission in the EU governing body. The same happened in the December 2008 elections, which came as a surprise to many people.

At the June 2009 European Parliament election, Becali ran on Vadim&#x27;s Greater Romania Party (PRM) ticket and won a seat in the European Parliament. However, on June 9, Romanian judges upheld a travel ban on Becali for the duration of an illegal incarceration investigation by police, banning him from taking his seat in the EP; Becali retorted that he intended to take his seat in Brussels and dared the justice system to arrest him in Belgium. Eventually, the Romanian supreme court lifted all restrictions on him.

He also ran in the 2009 presidential elections where he got 1.91% of the vote.

In 2012, he was selected as a candidate of the Social Liberal Union (USL) for a deputy mandate in Bucharest, Sector 6, at the National Liberal Party&#x27;s (PNL) side. He negotiated the coalition of PNG-CD with PNL, but the majority of the liberals did not agree with this measure. On 19 October 2012, Becali joined PNL, with the support of the party president, Crin Antonescu. He won the election in the 25th uninominal college with 65% of the votes. Becali requested to be a member of the Judicial Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and received assurances that he will be appointed. He resigned from PNL after receiving penal condemnation. On 29 May 2013, the Chamber of Deputies decreed the end of Becali&#x27;s term as a parliamentarian.

==Electoral history==
===Mayor of Bucharest===
===Presidential elections===
==Political positions==
His political views are nationalistic; he declared himself a follower of the Pre-World War II Romanian Legionnaire Movement and called for the canonization of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.

His 2004 electoral slogan &quot;I, Gigi Becali, swear to all Romanians and to God that I&#x27;ll make Romania shine like the holy sun of the sky&quot; (&quot;Eu Gigi Becali, jur în fața tuturor românilor și în fața lui Dumnezeu că voi face ca România să strălucească precum soarele sfânt de pe cer!&quot;) is taken from the testament of Ion Moța, one of the founders of the Iron Guard.

In 2005, Dan Pavel resigned from his job as Becali&#x27;s adviser because of Becali&#x27;s links with Noua Dreaptă, a neofascist organization. Pavel claims that a few months after, Becali gave up those links.

===Raport with Băsescu and PDL===
Becali and the party he was leading were previously allied with the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) in Bucharest&#x27;s local council. At that time, the PDL leaders announced they don&#x27;t want a National Liberal (PNL) vice-mayor, but they would rather support one from Becali&#x27;s party.

==Controversies==

===Views on homosexuality===

In line with his conservative Orthodox Christian views, Becali has often made inflammatory remarks in the press regarding LGBT people. During his 2004 presidential campaign one of the main themes of his rhetoric was opposition to sexual minorities, which he voiced over and over in interviews and TV appearances.

On 26 May 2006, Becali&#x27;s personal foundation, the &quot;George Becali Christian Foundation&quot;, along with the Romanian Orthodox Church and 22 NGOs, signed a protest letter calling on the government and the courts to ban the Bucharest GayFest 2006 parade, focused that year on the theme of same-sex unions. A few days later, the Bucharest Court of Appeals ruled, however, that the parade was legal, and it was ensured significant police protection. Becali justified his opposition to the pride parade by stating that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t discriminate against homosexuals&quot; but that, &quot;They abuse their rights. This is proselytism. They can do what they want in their homes, but not on the streets. I call on the Romanian Orthodox Church to defend the Christian faith and morals&quot;. Becali declared that he intended to pay for a referendum on same-sex marriage, which he believed 99% of people would vote against. He was also widely criticized in the media for asking, &quot;Why [are there] so many homosexuals? I&#x27;ll give two or five million dollars [for a referendum], so we can finish off all homosexuals in the country.&quot;

The media commentator Dan Tapalagă, in an editorial at the &quot;Cotidianul&quot; newspaper, criticized the Romanian Orthodox Church for its coalition with Becali, and its opposition to the gay pride parade, which he sarcastically termed as &quot;the sin of the Becalised Church&quot;.

In an opinion piece written after Becali&#x27;s inflammatory declaration, journalist Radu Călin Cristea quoted Cristian Pârvulescu, a Romanian political analyst, who described Becali as a &quot;populist who practices a superficial form of legionarism&quot;, referring to the fascist Iron Guard movement which took place in 1930s Romania and whose members were named &quot;legionnaires&quot; (&quot;legionari&quot;). Cristea also warned that society and the political class should stop regarding Becali as an &quot;inoffensive and amusing clown&quot;.

In October 2006, Gigi Becali was awarded the LGBT community&#x27;s &quot;black ball&quot; for the most homophobic personality in Romania, as part of the 2006 Gay Awards Gala which took place during the Gay Film Nights Festival of Cluj-Napoca.

During Bucharest&#x27;s annual GayFest in June 2007, Becali seemed to have tempered his homophobic stance. He declared in an interview that &quot;I love them [homosexuals] in the same way that I love all other people. They can marry at the City Hall, every day, 10 of them if they want to. But in church, they don&#x27;t have a place.&quot; When questioned about homosexuality in another interview conducted during the 2007 GayFest, he stated, &quot;They can do what they want... marry... I don&#x27;t have anything against that&quot;. On the question of whether he would accept a gay person in the New Generation Party of which he is president, Becali replied &quot;But why would I have a problem with that? Who knows how many there already are?&quot;

In September 2007, he resumed his homophobic speech, stating that if he becomes president of Romania, he will &quot;get rid of all homosexual and lesbian clubs&quot; and create special neighbourhoods for homosexuals and lesbians, so that &quot;they can stay there and leave us [alone]&quot;. He also referred to gays as &quot;sinners&quot; and said that &quot;they should go to the priest if they have problems in their head&quot;. The secretary-general of the New Generation Party, Cătălin Dâncu, later appeared to distance himself from Becali&#x27;s comments, declaring that, &quot;As long as EU principles clearly state that minority rights must be respected, Romania as a member-state must respect them&quot;.

===Legal action for discrimination against homosexuals===

In 2010 Becali made public statements that Steaua would never employ a gay footballer. ACCEPT, a Romanian gay rights organisation, complained against Becali and Steaua to Romania&#x27;s National Council for Combating Discrimination that these statements breached Romania&#x27;s anti-discrimination and hate speech laws. The Council upheld the complaint against Becali. However, it imposed no fine because of a Romanian law that a fine cannot be imposed more than six months after the discriminatory act. The Council dismissed the complaint against Steaua because Becali is not an official spokesperson of the club. ACCEPT appealed the decision to the Bucharest Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal has referred questions of European Union law to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court heard the case on 22 January 2012 and delivered its judgment on the 25th of April 2013, in which it found that homophobic statements regarding recruitment of football players made by a person who is perceived by the public as having a leading role in the football club can constitute direct discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which is prohibited by the Council Directive 2000/78 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.

===Xenophobia===

Some of Becali&#x27;s remarks have been considered xenophobic; for instance, in May 2008, the National Audiovisual Council fined the OTV channel for allowing Becali&#x27;s &quot;aggressive and xenophobic speech&quot;, which &quot;instigated to hate against the Hungarian minority in Romania&quot; to go on live, without any intervention from Dan Diaconescu, the talk show host. He also believes in a conspiracy of the &quot;Hungarian Freemasons&quot;, claiming that it is they who are financing Steaua&#x27;s adversary, CFR Cluj.

In November 2001, Becali and his bodyguards insulted and physically abused Malonga Parfait, the host of the satirical football TV show &quot;Fotbal la Maxx&quot;. Becali called Parfait a &quot;monkey&quot; allegedly because the latter is of African origin.

There have been numerous controversies with the violent declarations linked with the Steaua football team, including the use of slurs against the Romani and other minorities by fans and employees of Becali. He also sang in April 2005 a manea which included a racial slur against the Roma.

In 2012, Gigi Becali refused to sign French football player Florent Sinama Pongolle on the basis that he was black, even though Romanian football player Bănel Nicoliță, who played with him at the French club Saint-Etienne, said that the player was very talented.

===Violence===
In February 2002, Becali cursed and threatened Cristian Tudor Popescu, a well-known journalist, in a café, after the latter had written the article &quot;O statuie pentru Puiu Pașcu&quot; (&quot;A Statue for Puiu Pașcu&quot; – a former Minister of Defense in the Social Democratic Party cabinet of Adrian Năstase) in &quot;Adevărul&quot; about the controversial land swap with the Army and the assault on Malonga Parfait. Becali told Popescu that he should have been shot and that the journalists destroyed Romania.

In 2005, Becali provoked controversy by using extremely vulgar language in an interview, insulting the reporter and the channel he worked for (Antena 1).

In July 2005, in a restaurant, Becali cursed, spat and spilled a glass of wine on Șerban Huidu, the creator of the satirical TV show &quot;Cronica Cârcotașilor&quot;. Becali got the nickname &quot;Ioan Botezătorul&quot; (John the Baptist) after this incident.

Following a Steaua București match in April 2006, his bodyguards used violence against a female reporter of Realitatea TV after Becali asked them to &quot;take her away from that place&quot;.

He currently is one of the favorite subjects of the Romanian media, due to his frequent slips of the tongue and inflammatory remarks. For example, in July 2005, a reporter called Becali to ask him some questions related to the Steaua București football club. Becali used this opportunity to unleash a flurry of curses addressed to Antena 1 and Dan Voiculescu. He himself said in the dialogue that &quot;he is not a civilized man&quot;.

In 2008, he admitted that when he lost money in a casino, he lost his temper and began throwing chairs toward the windows, breaking them.

In April 2009 Becali was arrested over illegally holding 3 people against their will, because he suspected they were involved in stealing his car. He was arrested for a month, but he got out of jail after two weeks. Four other people, his bodyguards, Cătălin Zmărăndescu, Ștefan Dediu, Nicolae Dumitrașcu and Dumitru Beciual, who were also involved in the incident, were issued arrest warrants as well. Becali announced his candidacy for the European Parliament from his prison cell. Nick Thorpe, the BBC&#x27;s correspondent to Romania, says that many Romanians see him as a victim of crime rather than a perpetrator, and that sympathy about the case undoubtedly helped Becali win a seat in Brussels for the nationalist Greater Romania Party. Romanian judges initially barred Becali from taking his MEP seat due to ongoing police investigation. Eventually, the Romanian Supreme Court lifted all bans and Becali was allowed to take his Brussels seat. Becali spent three weeks in jail during the investigation. In February 2013, Becali was given a suspended sentence of 3 years in jail for this case.

===Misogyny===
In September 2007, Becali sparked controversy when he insulted parliamentarian Lavinia Șandru, stating that she should &quot;go and become a candidate for the ring road, not for the European Parliament&quot;, a veiled reference to prostitution. He has also remarked that a woman &quot;has no more value&quot; after she has given birth to a child. This led to a group of twenty-six women reporting Becali to the National Council for Combating Discrimination for contravening Romania&#x27;s anti-discrimination laws. On October 6, the Council ruled that Becali&#x27;s comments were discriminatory towards women and &quot;affected the dignity of women&quot;, with Becali being fined 500 lei.

=== Various ===
Becali has also been sued various times, mostly over slander, by the football coach Anghel Iordănescu, politician Radu Berceanu and a Divizia A referee, Cristian Balaj.

Becali has been an outspoken critic of COVID-19 restrictions and vaccinations, comparing vaccines to being &quot;shot in the head&quot;. Despite claiming that he has not explicitly forbidden staff at FCSB from getting vaccinated, the low uptake of vaccines has led to large outbreaks of the virus within the squad, forcing the club to compete with only 13 senior players and no head coach in an October 2021 match.

==Conviction==
George Becali was sentenced to three years in prison on 20 May 2013. According to the prosecutors, between 1996 and 1999, in the role of administrator of the state&#x27;s public property land in the Voluntari area, the Ministry of National Defense performed two land swaps with George Becali. The total area of the two traded plots was 0.2889 square kilometers of land. This trade resulted in US$892,758 of damage to the Romanian state.

<doc id="1212133" wikidata="Q6150484" url="?curid=1212133" title="Jana Bennett">
<text>Jana Eve Bennett (6 November 1955 – 11 January 2022) was an American-born British media consultant; member of the board of the British Library; member of the board of the Headlong Theatre Company. Previously she was President and General Manager of History, and H2 at A+E Networks in New York City. She joined A+E Networks in June 2013 as President of The Biography Channel (later bio) and Lifetime Movie Network. Bio was rebranded as FYI in July 2014.

Prior to joining A+E Networks, she was President of BBC Worldwide Networks and Global BBC iPlayer. In that role she was responsible for BBC Worldwide&#x27;s television channels, which operate in more than 100 countries, and the development and roll out of the commercial global iPlayer. She was also Worldwide&#x27;s Managing Director for Latin America with oversight of the company&#x27;s businesses in the region. She sat on Worldwide&#x27;s Executive Board and on the Board of UKTV, Britain&#x27;s second largest pay-TV group. She took up this role in February 2011 moving from the BBC&#x27;s UK public service where she had been Director of Vision at the BBC from 2006. As Director of BBC Vision, she headed &quot;the largest multi-media production, commissioning and broadcast group of its kind in the world&quot; with overall responsibility for BBC Television and its online services, BBC Films and BBC Productions. Previously she was Director of Television (appointed January 2002). In her two most recent roles at the BBC, Jana Bennett &quot;steered the BBC TV portfolio through its transition into the mainstream digital age.&quot; She was the first female director of the BBC, and oversaw the launch of numerous shows, including Strictly Come Dancing, Miranda, and the reinvented Doctor Who franchise. She was previously Executive Vice President and General Manager at Discovery Communications in the US.

Bennett was a member of the governing board of the Pew Research Center. She was also a Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and was made a Fellow of the Royal Television Society in 1999.

==Early life and education==
Bennett was born in Cooperstown, New York on 6 November 1955, the third of five daughters born to Gordon and Elizabeth (née Cushing) Bennett. Her father was an English professor and her mother was a librarian and educator. In 1969, her family moved to England, living in Felpham, where she was educated at Bognor Regis Comprehensive School. She then studied philosophy, politics and economics at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she was in a band with future Prime Minister Tony Blair. She undertook post-graduate studies at the London School of Economics where she was awarded an MSc (Dist) for her work on strategic analysis and international and defence studies.

==BBC career==
In 1979, Bennett won a place on the BBC News trainee scheme, and began her first period of employment with the corporation working on radio and television news; BBC Newcastle&#x27;s &quot;Look North&quot; and Radio Sheffield. She worked on &quot;Nationwide&quot;, &quot;The Money Programme&quot; and &quot;Newsnight&quot;. She became a producer of &quot;Panorama&quot; in 1986, and co-authored &quot;The Disappeared: Voices from a Secret War&quot; with the BBC&#x27;s diplomatic editor John Simpson about the actions of Argentina&#x27;s military government during the same year. In 1990, she became editor of the BBC&#x27;s science documentary series &quot;Horizon&quot;. One of her most successful episodes was &quot;Death of the Iceman&quot;, about a body retrieved from a glacier which turned out to be the oldest frozen mummy ever to be found. Awards she won during this period included the 1991 News and Documentary Emmy for her role as Executive Producer of the film &quot;Suicide Mission to Chernobyl&quot; which also aired on the WGBH program &quot;Nova&quot; in the United States.

In 1994, she was appointed the BBC&#x27;s Head of Science, the first woman to take that role. She initially didn&#x27;t believe she would get the job, as she was heavily pregnant when she interviewed for the post. Under her leadership, the department expanded the range and ambition of its programming, winning awards for series such as &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;The Human Body&quot; and &quot;Meet The Ancestors&quot; and business formats such as &quot;Blood on the Carpet&quot;, &quot;Back to the Floor&quot; and the medical format &quot;Trust Me, I&#x27;m a Doctor&quot;. She introduced a new animal genre to UK television with the highly successful and long-running &quot;Animal Hospital&quot;, alongside live events such as &quot;Hospitalwatch&quot;. The science department also pioneered content rich web sites and was one of the first areas to use email inside the BBC. She joined the BBC&#x27;s Board of Management in 1997 as Director of Production, then became Director of Programmes for the former BBC Production division until she left the BBC to join Discovery Communications as General Manager of the TLC channel in August 1999. She was appointed an OBE in 2000 for her work in science broadcasting.

==Discovery Communications==
At TLC Bennett transformed the channel&#x27;s ratings and revenue performance. She introduced a new editorial direction under the slogan &quot;Life Unscripted&quot; which included reality-drama and interior design shows, some of them based on popular British formats. The audience success of shows like &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;, and &quot;Junkyard Wars&quot; exemplified a shift in programming towards more mass-appeal shows. Ratings rose under her leadership.

== Later BBC career ==
In 2002, Bennett returned to the UK to take the job of Director of Television. In this capacity she took charge of the launch and expansion of the BBC&#x27;s portfolio of 7 digital TV channels: BBC Three, BBC Four, HD TV and the children&#x27;s channels, CBBC and CBeebies. This included winning the approval of the government for the launch of BBC Three, the corporation&#x27;s youth orientated digital television channel, which at the time was considered by some to be a controversial development for the BBC.

In 2006 the BBC&#x27;s Director-General, Mark Thompson reorganised the BBC&#x27;s divisional structure, creating BBC Vision from the amalgamation of the corporation&#x27;s Television, Drama Entertainment &amp; Children&#x27;s and Factual &amp; Learning divisions. Bennett was promoted from Director of Television to Director of Vision taking &quot;overall creative and leadership responsibility&quot; for the commissioning, production and scheduling of television, video and online content across the BBC&#x27;s analogue and digital television networks (excluding the BBC News and Parliament channels), the web, mobile phones and interactive technology.

During Bennett&#x27;s tenure, BBC television was responsible for natural history landmarks, such as &quot;Life&quot;, worldwide entertainment hits, including &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot;; new comedy formats, such as Outnumbered and &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;. Dramas ranged from period classics like &quot;Cranford&quot; to contemporary pieces such as &quot;Criminal Justice&quot; and &quot;Occupation&quot;, from science fiction in the shape of &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to detective series such as &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, &quot;Wallander&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;.

Bennett&#x27;s division was also heavily involved in the planning and launch of the corporation&#x27;s on-demand service, BBC iPlayer, providing 400 hours content for the service each week. In a speech to the Royal Television Society in 2007, she articulated a fresh approach to the BBC&#x27;s mission to inform and educate in the digital era. She also championed new multi-media approaches to major fundraising entertainment events. In partnership with Comic Relief, the BBC produced the first truly digital Red Nose Day in 2009.

She implemented the BBC&#x27;s out of London strategy for commissioning and production. In 2010, she launched the BBC&#x27;s year of science across television, radio and online. In the same year she established BBC One HD, and also announced a major new Shakespeare Season.

In addition to the BBC branded television channels, as Director of Vision, Bennett had responsibility for feature film production through BBC Films, whose credits include Oscar-winning &quot;Man on Wire&quot; as well as BAFTA award-winners &quot;Mrs Brown&quot;, &quot;An Education&quot;, &quot;In the Loop&quot;, &quot;Fish Tank&quot; and &quot;StreetDance 3D&quot;, the first 3D film produced outside the US. Bennett was appointed to BBC Worldwide as President, Worldwide Networks and Global iPlayer in February 2011. Bennett left BBC Worldwide in 2012 following a reorganisation of the company.

==A+E Networks==
In June 2012, Bennett was appointed President of The Biography Channel (bio) and Lifetime Movie Network (LMN) at A+E Networks in New York. She served in this role until 2017.

==Personal life==
Bennett was a member of the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences&#x27; Executive Committee and of the Advisory Board of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. She was a trustee of Comic Relief, on the board of OurBrainBank UK, and fellow of the Royal Television Society. She was on the board of Women in Film and Television and in 2011 and 2012 she was included in the WFTV power list.

In 1995, Bennett married Richard Clemmow, an editor and fellow media executive. The couple had two children.

In May 2019, Bennett was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a kind of brain tumour. She died at her home in Oxfordshire on 11 January 2022, at the age of 66.

<doc id="1212136" wikidata="Q378849" url="?curid=1212136" title="Navantia">
<text>Navantia is a Spanish state-owned shipbuilding enterprise dedicated to civil and military naval construction, the design of deep-tech systems and the manufacture of structures for the renewable energy sector, such as offshore wind or hydrogen. 

It was established in 2005 following the segregation of the military assets of the IZAR Group. The company designs, builds, and supports different types of surface vessels, submarines, and systems. It directly employs nearly 4,000 workers distributed among its operating centers in A Coruña, Cádiz, Cartagena and Madrid. 

Navantia is the fifth-largest shipbuilder in Europe and the ninth-largest in the world. The company is also expanding into markets such as renewable energy, the offshore industry and naval services. 

==Company==

The origins of Navantia go back to the beginnings of Spanish naval construction in the 13th century with the Real Atarazanas de Sevilla and the Real Carenero of San Fernando. Ships made in these yards played a key role in the discovery of America, but demand for larger ships with greater drafts meant that navy ship production was moved to Arsenal de Ferrol (A Coruña), Arsenal de Cartagena (Murcia), and La Carraca, (Cádiz) under reforms introduced by the Marques de la Ensenada and Jorge Juan in the eighteenth century.

These shipyards became part of the Spanish Naval Construction Society (La Naval) where civil shipyards such as Matagorda in Puerto Real (Cádiz) or Sestao (Vizcaya) also belonged. The state took over the military arsenals at the end of the Spanish Civil War and formed the Empresa Nacional Bazán in 1947 to build ships using foreign technology. Bazán later began to develop its own ship projects.

IZAR was formed in 2000 following a merger between Astilleros Españoles, a company that brought together publicly-owned civil shipyards, and the Empresa Nacional Bazán. To achieve greater efficiency, the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI), the largest shareholder and manager of the IZAR group, separated the military branch in December 2004 and subsequently formed Navantia in March 2005. The civil operations were later also transferred to Navantia. The company is 100% owned by SEPI, the Spanish state-owned industrial holding group, and it designs, builds, repairs, and modernizes military and civilian vessels. 

In March 2016, Navantia was selected as the &#x27;preferred bidder&#x27; for two logistics support ships for the Royal Australian Navy. In April 2021, Navantia launched its first completely Spanish designed and built submarine, the Issac Peral S-81. This was 133 years after the launch of the world&#x27;s first functional military submarine, the Peral.

<doc id="1212138" wikidata="Q6179140" url="?curid=1212138" title="Jenny Abramsky">
<text>Dame Jennifer Gita Abramsky (born 7 October 1946) is a British media producer, philanthropist and Chancellor of the University of East Anglia. She was chairman of the UK&#x27;s National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF). Until her retirement from the BBC, Abramsky was its most senior woman employee; she was Director of Audio and Music.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family, she was the daughter of Miriam, a social worker and former communist who was in Brick Lane during Oswald Mosley&#x27;s fascist marches, and Chimen Abramsky, a professor of Jewish studies and rare book expert. One of her grandfathers was Yehezkel Abramsky, a prominent Orthodox rabbi and scholar who headed the London Beth Din rabbinical court for 17 years.

In her youth Abramsky wished to become a ballerina, going so far as to study with the Rambert Dance Company; even attempting to join the Royal Ballet but failing supposedly due to her short stature of only 5 ft. She was educated at Holland Park Comprehensive School, London, and then completed her education at the University of East Anglia, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in English.

==Career==
In 1969, she joined the BBC as a programmes operations assistant, and in 1973 was appointed as a producer of &quot;The World at One&quot;. She became the first woman editor of the agenda-setting &quot;Today&quot; programme, ran the first Gulf War Radio 4 News FM service, and went on to launch Britain&#x27;s first continuous news and sport radio station, BBC Radio 5 Live, before launching the television channel BBC News 24. She launched the BBC&#x27;s online news website, news.bbc.co.uk. She was named Director of BBC Radio in January 1999 and was subsequently promoted to the BBC&#x27;s executive board with overall responsibility for BBC Radios 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Live and the BBC&#x27;s digital radio stations 1Xtra, BBC 7, 6 Music, 5 Live Sports Extra and the Asian Network; the three BBC orchestras based in England; and the Proms. In 2006 she became Director of Audio and Music – adding online services, audio on demand and podcasting to her remit of broadcast radio.

She had an annual programming budget of £236 million (about US$475m) and a staff of 1,681. Under her leadership, by the first three months of 2007 the BBC&#x27;s radio stations had an audience share of 56.6 percent – compared with the 13.9 percent of listeners shared by all commercial radio broadcasters – and a reach of almost 33.5 million people – a record, according to &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper (9 July 2007). The paper listed Abramsky as the 18th most powerful person in the UK&#x27;s media, though she had slipped from No. 11 in the paper&#x27;s 2006 ranking.

=== Post-BBC ===
It was announced in June 2008 that Abramsky was retiring from the BBC after 39 years of service, to be replaced by Tim Davie. After leaving the BBC she began focusing her efforts on preserving cultural sites. She currently serves on the board of trustees for the UK&#x27;s largest youth drama festival, the Shakespeare Schools Festival and is a Fellow of The Radio Academy. She is Chair of Trustees of National Life Stories and of the Royal Academy of Music. She previously served as Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund (now The National Lottery Heritage Fund) as well.

In 2016 she was appointed to the trustees of Canal &amp; River Trust the charity responsible for 2000 miles of canals and rivers in England &amp; Wales. In 2017 she was appointed to be the deputy Chair of Canal &amp; River Trust. She is a member of the Audit and Risk Committee, and is chair of the appointments committee. In April 2024, she was appointed as the Chancellor of the University of East Anglia.

==Personal life==
Abramsky married Alasdair Liddell, a former head of planning for the NHS, in 1976. They had two children and were married until his death from an aneurism on 31 December 2012.

==Honours==
Abramsky was elevated from Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. She was further elevated to Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours.

She was also one of the first nine people to be inducted into the Digital Radio Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1212140" wikidata="Q2497297" url="?curid=1212140" title="Voluntary commitment">
<text>Voluntary commitment is the act or practice of choosing to admit oneself to a psychiatric hospital, or other mental health facility. Unlike in involuntary commitment, the person is free to leave the hospital against medical advice, though there may be a requirement of a period of notice or that the leaving take place during daylight hours. In some jurisdictions, a distinction is drawn between &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;informal&quot; voluntary commitment, and this may have an effect on how much notice the individual must give before leaving the hospital. This period may be used for the hospital to use involuntary commitment procedures against the patient. People with mental illness can write psychiatric advance directives in which they can, in advance, consent to voluntary admission to a hospital and thus avoid involuntary commitment.

In the UK, people who are admitted to hospital voluntarily are referred to either as &quot;voluntary patients&quot; or &quot;informal patients&quot;. These people are free to discharge against medical advice, unless it is felt that they are at immediate risk, then a doctor can use mental health law to hold people in the hospital for up to 72 hours. People who are detained by mental health law are referred to as &quot;formal patients&quot;.

In Europe, the treatment of mental illness became a health policy priority under the impetus of the World Health Organization Mental Health Plan for Europe elaborated in 2005. This plan promoted a more effective balance between inpatient hospital care and outpatient care through the development of community mental healthcare services. Since the 1970s, the majority of European countries have shifted away from institutionalised care in large mental hospitals to the integration of patients in their living environment through the provision of home and community care services. Germany, England, France and Italy deinstitutionalized psychiatric care in the second half of the 20th century, but the speed and methods by which it was implemented varied, notably due to differences in social and political contexts. In Italy, the reform movement took place a little later. Until the 1968 Mariotti Law introducing voluntary internment, admission into a psychiatric hospital was only by compulsory commitment and was entered in an individual&#x27;s criminal records.

== Coercion ==
In some countries, voluntary patients are able to choose to decline treatment, but service users may feel the need to comply with treatment to avoid formal commitment and remain in inpatient treatment and can experience informal coercion and some research suggests some voluntary patients are involuntarily forced to undergo treatment. Voluntary patients are often not familiar with their legal rights or aware of their status.

<doc id="1212143" wikidata="Q4805471" url="?curid=1212143" title="Ashley Highfield">
<text>Ashley Highfield is Chairman of Oyster Yachts Limited (since May 2018), makers of luxury British sailing boats. He is also founder of Henley Partners limited, his vehicle for investing in and advising businesses across a range of sectors. He is an Associate Director of Deloitte LLP. Between 2011 and 2018 he was CEO of Johnston Press Plc, owners of &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;, and (from April 2016) &quot;i&quot; in May 2018. He has also worked for Microsoft and the BBC as main board director responsible for New Media and Technology.

In June 2015 Culture Secretary John Whittingdale named Highfield as one of eight people on an advisory board tasked with working on the renewal of the BBC&#x27;s royal charter - which sets out the corporation&#x27;s remit. In October 2015 he was appointed Chairman of the News Media Association, the trade body for the UK&#x27;s newspaper industry. He has held a number of non-executive roles, most recently on the boards of William Hill plc (for 9 years between 2009 and 2018) and the British Film Institute (for 7 years between 2010 and 2017). 

He lives in Oxfordshire with his wide and two children, Amelie and Max.

==Career==
Educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, and City University, London, Highfield joined Coopers &amp; Lybrand, (now PwC) on graduation, working as a management consultant in the TMT sector for six years. In 1994 he returned to the UK to become head of IT and New Media for NBC Europe, before joining Flextech - a pay-TV channel provider - where he worked for five years as director of interactive services.

In October 2000 he joined the BBC as Director of New Media &amp; Technology working for Greg Dyke who said in his autobiography &quot;Inside Story&quot; &quot;Ashley is one of the most inventive people I know&quot;. Dyke also said &quot;Ashley didn&#x27;t have an easy task bringing all the BBC&#x27;s online activity under one division, but he did it with great success&quot;.

In 2005, under new Director General Mark Thompson, Highfield retained his place on the new slimmed-down Executive Board and was given additional responsibility for Broadcast and Production technology across the BBC. In July 2006 the BBC reformed its structure, turning the New Media department into the Future Media &amp; Technology department (including BBC&#x27;s Information &amp; Archives business) with Highfield at its head. During his tenure, Highfield oversaw a growth in the BBC&#x27;s online presence from 3.5 million to 17 million users, and was responsible for the development and launch of BBC iPlayer.

In 2008 he commissioned the Digital Media Initiative, a tapeless production system. The project was axed in 2013 (some five years after Highfield left) at a cost of £100m after failing to deliver.

At the time of his appointment to the BBC he was the youngest ever member of the organisation&#x27;s Executive Board. His department was responsible for the BBC&#x27;s internet presence - bbc.co.uk, interactive TV - BBC Red Button, mobile services, the BBC&#x27;s technology portfolio and the BBC&#x27;s Archive. At the BBC, Highfield claimed £47,000 in expenses between 2004 and 2009, while on a salary of £466,000; this included a subscription to Sky and two iPods.

It was announced on 14 April 2008 that Highfield had been appointed the CEO of Project Kangaroo. Kangaroo was a joint venture between BBC, ITV &amp; Channel 4 offering an internet-based one stop shop for all TV programmes on-demand, which was halted by the Competition Commission. He left the project in November 2008, to work for Microsoft. He was UK Managing Director of Microsoft (Consumer &amp; Online), responsible for Windows Mobile, MSN, Hotmail, Windows Live/Instant Messenger and Bing.

Highfield was appointed CEO of Johnston Press in 2011. In his first full year, Highfield earned a £400,000 salary, with bonuses and pension contributions of £301,000.

In his first year the company reduced its workforce by almost a quarter as Highfield dealt with a legacy of massive debt. In May 2014 JP secured a significant refinancing deal to help put the company on a secure financial footing.

==Profile==
He lives in central London and is divorced.

He held two non-executive roles – on the boards of William Hill and the British Film Institute.

==Awards==
In 2003 Highfield was awarded the Digital Innovator internet award by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; who dubbed his vision of a 100% digital Britain a &quot;tour de force&quot;. In 2004 he was named &#x27;most influential individual in technology&#x27; by online technology news site Silicon.Com for overseeing a number of &#x27;firsts&#x27; for a major broadcaster, including the use of peer-to-peer, interactive TV, and multi-casting of TV. In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; placed Highfield at #31 in its annual survey of the most powerful people in the UK media industry.

In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and, in 2007, a Fellow of the Royal Television Society.

<text>VisiCorp was an early personal computer software publisher. Its most famous products were Microchess, Visi On and VisiCalc.

It was founded in 1977 by Dan Fylstra as the software publisher Personal Software. In 1978, it merged with Peter R. Jennings&#x27;s Toronto-based software publisher Micro-Ware, with the two taking a 50% ownership each in the resulting company and Personal Software becoming the name of the combined company. It continued to publish the software from its original constituents, including Jennings&#x27; Microchess program for the MOS Technology KIM-1 computer, and later Commodore PET, Apple II, TRS-80, and Atari 8-bit computers. In 1979 it released VisiCalc, which would be so successful that in 1982 the company was renamed VisiCorp Personal Software, Inc.

:* VisiCalc was the first electronic spreadsheet for personal computers, developed by Software Arts and published by VisiCorp.
:* Visi On was the first GUI for the IBM PC.

Bill Gates came to see Visi On at a trade show, and this seems to be what inspired him to create a windowed GUI for Microsoft. VisiCorp was larger than Microsoft at the time, and the two companies entered negotiations to merge, but could not agree on who would sit on the board of directors. Microsoft Windows when it was released included a wide range of drivers, so it could run on many different PCs, while Visi On cost more, and had stricter system requirements. Lotus released Lotus 1-2-3 in 1983. Microsoft eventually released its own spreadsheet Microsoft Excel.

Early alumni of this company included Ed Esber, who would later run Ashton-Tate, Bill Coleman, who would found BEA Systems, Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Software and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Rich Melmon, who would co-found Electronic Arts, Bruce Wallace, author of &quot;Asteroids in Space&quot;, and Brad Templeton, who would found early dot-com company ClariNet and was the director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation from 2000 to 2010.

VisiCorp agreed in 1979 to pay 36–50% of VisiCalc revenue to Software Arts, compared to typical software royalties of 8—12%. It composed 70% of VisiCorp revenue in 1982 and 58% in 1983. By 1984 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated that although VisiCorp&#x27;s $43 million in 1983 sales made it the world&#x27;s fifth-largest microcomputer-software company, it was &quot;a company under siege&quot; with &quot;rapidly declining&quot; VisiCalc sales and mediocre Visi On sales. The magazine wrote that &quot;VisiCorp&#x27;s auspicious climb and subsequent backslide will no doubt become a &quot;How Not To&quot; primer for software companies of the future, much like Osborne Computer&#x27;s story has become the &quot;How Not To&quot; for the hardware industry.&quot;
 VisiCorp was sold to Paladin Software after a legal feud between Software Arts and VisiCorp.

<text>Charles Ronald George Nall-Cain, 3rd Baron Brocket (born 12 February 1952), also known as Charlie Brocket, is a peer, business owner and television presenter from the United Kingdom. He was jailed for insurance fraud in 1996.

==Biography==
Brocket is the son of Ronald Nall-Cain and Elizabeth Trotter. His father died when he was nine years old. Aged fifteen, he became the 3rd Baron Brocket on the death of his grandfather, Arthur Nall-Cain, 2nd Baron Brocket, also inheriting Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire. The Hall was in a poor state of repair, and he has since converted it into a hotel and conference venue. He still owns the hall through a trust which leases it to a German consortium. The lease will expire after fifty years.

An Old Etonian, Lord Brocket served in the 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars as a Lieutenant in Germany. He became known as a playboy and, in the 1980s and early 1990s, for his collection of classic cars, once owning forty-two Ferraris. He was convicted of insurance fraud in 1996 and sentenced to five years in prison, of which he served two and a half years. 

In 2004, he was a contestant on the third series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. Finishing in fourth place, his new-found fame turned him into a popular TV celebrity, yielding almost £1 million in offers. His autobiography, &quot;Call Me Charlie&quot;, was published in hardback in September 2004, coming in the Top 10 Best Sellers list of that year. 

Brocket hosted the ITV game show &quot;Scream! If You Want to Get Off&quot;, and presented &quot;Privates Exposed&quot;, a behind-the-scenes programme for &quot;Lads Army&quot;, on ITV2.

In 2007, he launched his own Brocket Hall Foods range of groceries.

In 2017, Brocket was featured in an episode of &quot;Can&#x27;t Pay? We&#x27;ll Take It Away!&quot; (Series 5, Episode 15).

==Marriage and family history==
In 1982, he married former &quot;Vogue&quot; model Isabell Maria Lorenzo. They had three children (including Antalya, Princess of Prussia as wife of Prince Frederick Alexander of Prussia, descendant of Queen Victoria). He and Isabell Maria Lorenzo were divorced in 1994.

In 2006 he married Harriet Victoria Warren. They had two children.

<text>Tauragė (; see other names) is an industrial city in Lithuania, and the capital of Tauragė County. In 2020, its population was 20,956. Tauragė is situated on the Jūra River, close to the border with the Kaliningrad Oblast, and not far from the Baltic Sea coast.

Although first mentioned in 1507, Tauragė did not receive its city charter until 1924, and its coat of arms (a silver hunting horn in a red field) until 1997. 

The previously small town was significantly developed in the 19th century and early 20th century, however its architecture suffered devastating damages during World War I and World War II. Notable surviving buildings in the city include the castle (19th century Russian Empire customs), 19th century Post office, buildings from the 20th century inter-war period, several churches: the Lutheran (built in 1843), the Catholic (1904) and Orthodox (1933). Lithuanian, Swedish and Danish factories operate in the city.

==Names and etymology==

Tauragė is a conjunction of two Lithuanian words: &quot;tauras&quot;, which means &quot;aurochs&quot;, and &quot;ragas&quot; which means &quot;horn&quot;, hence the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The city is known as &quot;Tauragie&quot; in Samogitian, as &quot;Tauroggen&quot; in German, &quot;Taurogi&quot; in Polish, &quot;Tovrig&quot; () in Yiddish, and &quot;Taurage&quot; (; historically &quot;Tauroggen&quot; [] or &quot;Taurogi&quot; []) in Russian.

Historically, Tauragė has also been called Tavrik, Tavrogi, Tavrig, Tevrig, Taurik and Tarogen. It is called Tan Ragh on the 1539 Carta Marina.

==History==
Tauragė is situated between two Baltic tribes and at the edge of two historical regions. In 13th c. donations written by Mindaugas, the king of Lithuania mentions that there are lands called Karšuva (Carsovia) and Skalva (Scalovia). On the eve of the Teutonic Order aggression, Skalva was situated southwest of the current town. It was inhabited by the Baltic tribe Skalviai (Scalovians). To the northeast there was a land called Žemaitija (Samogitia) with Žemaičiai (Samogitians) as inhabitants. Karšuva, the region which existed in these lands, was different because the peoples had the blood of the Kuršiai (Curonians) and Lamatiečiai (Lamatians), two nearby Baltic tribes. By inhabiting the northern borders of Skalva, the Carsovians became close to the Scalovians. Even the origin of the name Karšuva (Carsovia) can be linked to the ethnonym Kuršiai (Curonians), which is written as &quot;Cori, Corres, Kauren&quot; in old historical sources.

When the war with the Teutonic Order broke out, ethnic and administrative borders started to change rapidly. It is possible that in the end of the 13th c. and the start of 14th c., when Skalva suffered heavy casualties, Samogitians, supported by the rulers of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, tried to push to the southwest. But due to non-stopping attacks by the Teutonic Order in the 14th c. they had to retreat. Only in the 15-16th c. when the wars were over did Samogitians come back to their former lands. At that time northern parts of Skalva, which were left for Lithuania, was inhabited by Samogitians, because most of the Scalovians were killed or fled during the attacks of the Order.

First mentioned in 1507, the town has been a center of Lutheranism in Lithuania. Although it belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, there was a period when the land of Tauragė belonged to East Prussian rulers in economic terms. From 1691 until 1793, Tauragė belonged to Brandenburg-Prussia (the Kingdom of Prussia from 1701), after the marriage of Margrave Ludwig of Brandenburg to Princess Ludwika Karolina Radziwiłł. In 1793 it was ceded, along with Seirijai (Prussian Serrey), to Poland-Lithuania as &quot;compensation&quot; for the territories annexed in the Second Partition of Poland. In 1795, as with almost all of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the town became part of the Russian Empire in the Third Partition.

Tsar Alexander I of Russia, signed an armistice with Napoleon I in Tauragė on June 21, 1807, that was soon to be followed with the Treaties of Tilsit. On December 30, 1812, the Prussian General Yorck, signed the Convention of Tauroggen, declaring his troops neutral, that effectively ended the fragile Franco-Prussian alliance during the French invasion of Russia. In 1836, much of the city was destroyed by a fire. Honoré de Balzac stayed in Tauragė in 1843.
In 1915, a significant part of the city&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed by German troops during World War I. During the independent Republic of Lithuania (1918-1940), the war destroyed town grew rapidly and new modern buildings, factories were built. On September 9, 1927, the rebellion against the authoritarian rule of President Antanas Smetona broke out in Tauragė, but the revolt was quickly suppressed. After the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in 1940, the Tauragė Castle was a place of imprisonment for Lithuanian political dissidents and POWs. Many local inhabitants, including the parents and relatives of Roman Abramovich, were exiled to Siberia during the Soviet occupation in 1940. This saved the family from the Holocaust. When Operation Barbarossa commenced on June 22, 1941, the Soviets retreated, and Tauragė was captured by the German Wehrmacht after heavy bombing on the same day. About 4,000 Jews were murdered in Tauragė and nearby villages (about 40% of Tauragė population). In the autumn of 1944, the German occupation ended and the Soviets replaced them with a renewed occupation lasting until 1990. During the Soviet occupation the town was rebuilt and grew very rapidly, although the pre-war old town architecture was not preserved. Even the old market square and one of the main streets, Kęstučio, had been completely destroyed and built over. Only some old buildings of the town centre have survived to this day.

<text>Ban This Filth was a spoof television programme aired on Channel 4 in October 2004. The show was presented as a crusade against pornography, profanity and nudity on television. The three presenters are all elderly middle class women, who warn viewers what programmes not to watch in the coming week. It is presented in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, with segments such as:
* What not to watch, a review of programmes with nudity or pornographic scenes, the times and channels are given so viewers can avoid them
* Review of pornographic DVDs, presented, as what not to buy
* Interviews with porn stars, asking them to quit the business
* Documentary segments covering adult babies, or dogging for example

<text> (&quot;Ariadne on Naxos&quot;), Op. 60, is a 1912 opera by Richard Strauss with a German libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The opera&#x27;s unusual combination of elements of low commedia dell&#x27;arte with those of high opera seria points up one of the work&#x27;s principal themes: the competition between high and low art for the public&#x27;s attention.

== First version (1912) ==

The opera was originally conceived as a 30-minute divertissement to be performed at the end of Hofmannsthal&#x27;s adaptation of Molière&#x27;s play &quot;Le Bourgeois gentilhomme.&quot; Besides the opera, Strauss provided incidental music to be performed during the play. In the end, the opera occupied ninety minutes, and the performance of play plus opera occupied over six hours. It was first performed at the Hoftheater Stuttgart on 25 October 1912, directed by Max Reinhardt. The combination of the play and opera proved to be unsatisfactory to the audience: those who had come to hear the opera resented having to wait until the play finished.

The opera-and-play version was produced in Zürich on 5 December 1912 and Prague on 7 December 1912. The Munich premiere followed on 30 January 1913 in the old Residenztheater, a venue which was inferior for the presentation of opera, both acoustically and due to lack of space for the musicians. Hofmannsthal overruled the conductor Bruno Walter&#x27;s preference for the Hoftheater, on the grounds that the smaller theatre was more suitable for a work of this kind. The cast included the American Maude Fay as Ariadne, Otto Wolf as Bacchus, and Hermine Bosetti as Zerbinetta.
Strauss, being a native son, had a close association with Munich and was held in high regard, but had to miss the performance as he was on a concert tour in Russia. The audience openly expressed its disapproval of the piece by hissing after the first act. For the succeeding performances, Walter introduced cuts and moved the production to the Hoftheater, and the attendance began to improve. The 1912 version was also produced in Berlin beginning on 27 February 1913 and in Amsterdam in 1914.

In London the early version was given eight times at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre beginning on 27 May 1913. The Hofmannsthal adaptation of Molière&#x27;s play was presented in an English translation by W. Somerset Maugham under the title &quot;The Perfect Gentleman.&quot; The opera was sung in German with Eva von der Osten, Hermine Bosetti and Otakar Marák, conducted by Thomas Beecham. The reviewer in &quot;The Musical Times&quot; found the incidental music for the play to be more attractive than that for the opera, which nevertheless had &quot;many strong emotional appeals.&quot; However, the orchestration of the opera was thought to be &quot;peculiar&quot;, and in the finale, the love-making of Bacchus and Ariadne, tedious.

In 2012, the Salzburg Festival revived the first version, staged by Sven-Eric Bechtolf, and sung by Emily Magee, Elena Moșuc and Jonas Kaufmann, with conductor Daniel Harding.

== Second version (1916) ==

After these initial performances, it became apparent that the work as it stood was impracticable: it required a company of actors as well as an opera company, was thus very expensive to mount, and its length was likely to be a problem for audiences. So in 1913, Hofmannsthal proposed to Strauss that the play should be replaced by a prologue, which would explain why the opera combines a serious classical story with a comedy performed by a commedia dell&#x27;arte group. He also moved the action from Paris to Vienna. Strauss was initially reluctant, but he composed the prologue (and modified some aspects of the opera) in 1916, and this revised version was first performed at the Vienna State Opera on 4 October of that year. This is the version that is normally staged today, although the original play-plus-opera has been occasionally performed, such as at the 1997 Edinburgh International Festival and at the 2012 Salzburg Festival.

The most important aria in either version is Zerbinetta&#x27;s (High and mighty princess). Other important pieces of the opera are the arias of Ariadne (Where was I?), (There was something beautiful) and (There is a realm). Also of note is the Composer&#x27;s aria (Let&#x27;s be friends again).

===Performance history of the second version===
After its premiere in Vienna, the second version was first performed in Berlin on 1 November 1916, followed by Zürich on 28 January 1917 (in a production by the Mannheim Opera). It was first presented in Budapest on 19 April 1919 (in a Hungarian translation by Z. Harsányi), and in German in Graz on 12 March 1920, Amsterdam in January 1924, and London at the Royal Opera House on 27 May 1924 with Lotte Lehmann as Ariadne, Maria Ivogün as Zerbinetta (in her debut with the company), Elisabeth Schumann as the Composer, Karl Fischer-Niemann as Bacchus, and Carl Alwin conducting. Despite the stellar cast, the production was not successful, with one of the lowest box office returns of the season. It was repeated only once.

It was first performed in Italy in Turin at the on 7 December 1925 (in an Italian translation by O. Schanzer); in Sweden in Stockholm on 27 November 1926 (in Swedish); in Brussels on 17 March 1930 (in a French translation by P. Spaak); in Helsinki on 12 May 1931 (in a Finnish translation by A. af Enehjelm); in Rome at the Teatro Reale on 28 March 1935 (in German); Antwerp on 28 September 1935 (in Flemish); and in Paris at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 10 September 1937 (in German).

The United States premiere of the opera was given in German by the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company at the Academy of Music on 1 November 1928. Conducted by Alexander Smallens, the cast included Alma Peterson as the Primadonna/Ariadne, Charlotte Boykin as Zerbinetta, Irene Williams as the Composer, and Judson House as the Tenor/Bacchus. It was presented by the Juilliard School in New York City in English in a translation by A. Kalisch on 5 December 1934 with a cast of students including Josephine Antoine as Zerbinetta, Mack Harrell as Truffaldino, and Risë Stevens as Dryad. The opera was performed for the first time in Canada by the New York City Opera on tour at the Montreal Festivals in 1946.

===Productions in Vienna and Salzburg===
The original production at the Vienna State Opera from 1916 was performed 93 times until 1934. Amongst others, the title role was sung by Claire Born, Fanny Cleve, Charlotte Dahmen, 33 times by Maria Jeritza, 25 times by Lotte Lehmann, Germaine Lubin, Maria Nemeth, Vera Schwarz, Lucie Weidt and Paula Windheuser.

In 1926, the opera was first presented at the Salzburg Festival, staged by Lothar Wallerstein in Viennese settings, twice conducted by Clemens Krauss and once by Richard Strauss himself. Lotte Lehmann was Salzburg&#x27;s first Ariadne. Wallerstein was also the stage director of the second Viennese production in 1935, with settings by Oskar Strnad and costumes by Ladislaus Czettel. Josef Krips conducted. There were 38 performances until September 1943. Three months later a new production by Heinz Arnold was presented, with settings by Wilhelm Reinking and conducted by Karl Böhm. The cast featured Maria Reining as Ariadne, Max Lorenz as Bacchus, Alda Noni as Zerbinetta, Irmgard Seefried as composer, Paul Schöffler as Musiklehrer, Erich Kunz as Harlekin and Emmy Loose as Najade. Due to the war this production could only be shown seven times.

In 1947, Lothar Wallerstein, Robert Kautsky (stage settings and costumes) and Josef Krips presented a new production of the Vienna State Opera at the Theater an der Wien. The cast included Maria Reining, Max Lorenz, Irmgard Seefried, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Alfred Poell, Erich Kunz, Peter Klein, Marjan Rus, , Elisabeth Rutgers and Emmy Loose. This production was performed 20 times, also with Maria Cebotari, Lisa Della Casa, Anny Konetzni and Hilde Zadek as Ariadne, and with Peter Anders, Josef Gostic, Julius Patzak and Helge Rosvaenge as Bacchus.

In 1954, the opera premiered at the Salzburg Festival Hall, staged by Josef Gielen with settings and costumes by Stefan Hlawa. Karl Böhm conducted the Vienna Philharmonic, Lisa Della Casa and Rudolf Schock sang Ariadne and Bacchus, Irmgard Seefried was the composer and Hilde Güden represented Zerbinetta. The production was repeated during the following summer, and then went to Vienna, where it premiered in 1956 with a new cast: Hilde Zadek and Josef Gostic as Ariadne and Bacchus, Christa Ludwig as composer and Erika Köth as Zerbinetta.

In 1964, Günther Rennert staged a new production in Salzburg, again conducted by Karl Böhm. Sena Jurinac (composer), Jess Thomas (Bacchus), Reri Grist (Zerbinetta) and Christa Ludwig (Ariadne) were the most prominent cast members, supported by Lisa Otto, Lucia Popp, Paul Schöffler, David Thaw and Gerhard Unger in smaller roles. This production was also repeated the following summer.

In 1976, again Karl Böhm conducted a new Vienna State Opera production, this time designed and staged by Filippo Sanjust, with Gundula Janowitz as Ariadne, James King als Bacchus, Agnes Baltsa as composer and Edita Gruberová as Zerbinetta, supported by Erich Kunz, Walter Berry, Heinz Zednik, Barry McDaniel, Kurt Equiluz, Axelle Gall and Sona Ghazarian. Janowitz sang the Ariadne 48 times in Vienna, followed by Lisa Della Casa (40 performances), Anni Konetzni (34), Maria Jeritza (33), Leonie Rysanek (30), Lotte Lehmann (25), Gwyneth Jones (14), Maria Reining and Anna Tomowa-Sintow (both 12 performances each), Christel Goltz and Claire Watson (both 10).

From 1979 to 1982, the Salzburg Festival showed a new staging by Dieter Dorn, settings and costumes by Jürgen Rose, again conducted by Karl Böhm, with a cast headed by Hildegard Behrens and James King, with Trudeliese Schmidt, Edita Gruberová, Walter Berry, Kurt Equiluz, Murray Dickie and Olivera Miljaković.

===Metropolitan Opera performances===
The opera was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on 29 December 1962 with Leonie Rysanek as Ariadne, Jess Thomas as Bacchus, Gianna D&#x27;Angelo as Zerbinetta, the mezzo-soprano Kerstin Meyer as the Composer, Walter Cassel as the Music Master, and Karl Böhm conducting. As of 20 February 2010 it had been performed there a total of 88 times with revivals of the original production in 1963–4, 1970, 1976, 1979, 1984–5, and 1987–8, and a new production, directed by Elijah Moshinsky, first presented in 1993, followed by revivals in 1994, 1996–7, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2010. The opera is a favorite of the Met&#x27;s former music director James Levine, who conducted it a total of 44 times from 1976 to 2003. Interpreters of the role of Ariadne at the Met have included Jessye Norman (22 appearances from 1984 to 1993) and Deborah Voigt (17 appearances from 1993 to 2003). The role of the Composer has been sung there most often by a mezzo-soprano (at least 64 times), including, besides Kerstin Meyer, who sang the role 6 times, Tatiana Troyanos (19 appearances from 1976 to 1988), Susanne Mentzer (20 appearances from 1993 to 2003), Susan Graham (5 appearances in the fall of 2005), Sarah Connolly (5 appearances in the winter of 2010), and Joyce DiDonato (3 appearances in the spring of 2011). Soprano interpreters of the Composer have included Irmgard Seefried, Teresa Stratas (9 appearances: 4 in 1963–4; 1 in 1970; and 4 in the spring of 1994), Evelyn Lear (4 appearances in March 1970), and Maria Ewing (8 appearances in 1984–5). Singers of the coloratura soprano role of Zerbinetta have included, besides Gianna D&#x27;Angelo, who sang it 7 times, Roberta Peters (7 appearances in 1963–4), Kathleen Battle (9 appearances in 1987–8), and Natalie Dessay (12 appearances: 7 in the fall of 1997 and 5 in the spring of 2003).

== Roles ==


==Synopsis==
&quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; is in two parts, called the Prologue and the Opera. The first part shows the backstage circumstances leading up to the second part, which is in fact an opera within an opera.

===Prologue===
At the home of the richest man in Vienna, preparations for an evening of music are under way. Two troupes of musicians and singers have arrived. One is a burlesque group, led by the saucy comedienne Zerbinetta. The other is an opera company, who will present an &quot;opera seria&quot;, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, the work of the Composer. Members of the two companies quarrel over which performance should be presented first. However, the preparations are thrown into confusion by an announcement by the Major-domo. The dinner for the assembled guests has run longer than planned. Therefore, both performances must take place at the same time as they have been ordered and paid for. The performances must not run one minute later than scheduled, despite the late start, since at nine o&#x27;clock there will be fireworks in the garden.

At first, the impetuous young Composer refuses to discuss any changes to his opera. But his teacher, the Music Master, points out that his pay depends on accepting the situation, and counsels him to be prudent, and Zerbinetta turns the full force of her charm on him, so he drops his objections. The cast of the &quot;opera seria&quot; intrigue against each other, each demanding that his arias be not cut while the other performers&#x27; parts are cut instead. A dancing master introduces Zerbinetta into the plot, which she understands from her very own perspective, and she gets ready for the performance. The Composer realizes what he has assented to, plunges into despair and storms out.

===Opera===

Ariadne is shown abandoned by her former lover, Theseus, on the desert island of Naxos, with no company other than the nymphs Naiad, Dryad, and Echo. Ariadne bewails her fate, mourns her lost love, and longs for death. Zerbinetta and her four companions from the burlesque group enter and attempt to cheer Ariadne by singing and dancing, but without success. In a sustained and dazzling piece of coloratura singing, Zerbinetta tells the Princess to let bygones be bygones and insists that the simplest way to get over a broken heart is to find another man. In a comic interlude, each of the clowns pursues Zerbinetta. Eventually, she chooses Harlequin, a baritone, and the two sing a love duet together while the other clowns express frustration and envy.

The nymphs announce the arrival of a stranger on the island. Ariadne thinks it is Hermes, the messenger of death, but it is the god Bacchus, who is fleeing from the sorceress Circe. At first they do not understand their mistaken identification of each other. Bacchus eventually falls in love with Ariadne, who agrees to follow him to the realm of death to search for Theseus. Bacchus promises to set her in the heavens as a constellation. Zerbinetta returns briefly to repeat her philosophy of love: when a new love arrives, one has no choice but to yield. The opera ends with a passionate duet sung by Ariadne and Bacchus.

==Instrumentation==

The instrumentation of the work is unusual, as its complement of &#x27;double woodwind&#x27; is accompanied by significantly reduced brass and string forces on the one hand, and by a generous percussion section on the other.
* Woodwind: 2 flutes (alternating on piccolos), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (clarinet 2 doubles bass clarinet in A), 2 bassoons
* Brass: 2 horns, trumpet, trombone
* Percussion: timpani, glockenspiel, tambourine, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum
* Keyboards: harmonium, celesta, piano
* Strings: 6 violins, 4 violas, 4 cellos, 2 double basses, 2 harps

==Orchestral suite==

Music was extracted from both versions of the opera by D. Wilson Ochoa in 2011 for a purely orchestral arrangement: &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; Symphony-Suite, published by Boosey &amp; Hawkes and Schott Music. The 7 continuous sections combine into a 38-minute continuous suite that functions like a symphony: the Prologue introduces all the major musical themes, while each subsequent excerpt serves to &quot;develop&quot; each of those themes. Richard Strauss&#x27; original instrumentation was retained, except for having the 2nd Oboe now doubling on English horn, to be used in covering some vocal lines. This suite was premiered by Giancarlo Guerrero and the Nashville Symphony in October 2011, and recorded by JoAnn Falletta and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra in 2016.

<text>United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17 (1960), was a United States Supreme Court decision relating to civil rights. The Court overturned the ruling of a U.S. District Court, which had held that a law authorizing the Federal Government to bring civil actions against State Officials for discriminating against African-Americans citizens was unconstitutional.

Attorney General brought suit to enjoin (issue injunction) against Raines and other Georgia public officials from discriminating against African Americans wanting to vote. District court dismissed the complaint from Raines, &quot;et al.&quot; because this could be brought by private citizens.

<doc id="1212160" wikidata="Q250221" url="?curid=1212160" title="Alyx Vance">
<text>Alyx Vance is a fictional character from Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; video game series. She is introduced as a non-playable, supporting character in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004), accompanying the player&#x27;s character, Gordon Freeman, throughout much of the game. She subsequently appears in a similar capacity in &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot; (2006) and &quot;Episode Two&quot; (2007), and as the titular protagonist of the VR game &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; (2020).

Alyx is portrayed as a young woman in her mid-twenties of Afro-Asian descent, and is a prominent figure in the human resistance against the rule of the alien empire called the Combine and their human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. She is the daughter of resistance leader Dr. Eli Vance, and becomes a close friend and ally of Gordon. She received highly positive reviews from critics.

==Character design==

Alyx Vance was created for the video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, and her design was created by Dhabih Eng. Her motions are performed by actress Jamil Mullen, who also provides the face design. She is voiced by Merle Dandridge in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and its episodes, and Ozioma Akagha in &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;.

==Appearances==
Alyx appears in the video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; as a recurring ally to protagonist Gordon Freeman, and the daughter of Eli Vance, all of whom operate as members of the Resistance. She is first encountered when she saves Gordon from an attack, and later gives him the gravity gun (a tool used to manipulate objects) while playing with her robot, Dog. She helps Gordon through various incidents, including helping rescue her father and defeating one of the game&#x27;s antagonists, Wallace Breen. She also has disputes with the character Judith Mossman, who later betrays them before they eventually make peace and work together. She ultimately becomes separated from Gordon after the G-Man stops time during a dark energy explosion at the Citadel, removing Gordon from that point in time and leaving Alyx.

In the expansion, &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that Alyx was rescued by Vortigaunts, who also retrieve Gordon from G-Man, leaving them both outside the Citadel. They work together to delay the explosion by slowing the core&#x27;s progression toward meltdown. They later go through a zombie-infested underground station and later working with Barney Calhoun to rescue members of the rebellion before the Citadel explodes.

In &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Two&quot;, Alyx and Gordon travel to the White Forest Rocket Facility to deliver a crucial information packet stolen from the Citadel. Along the way, she is gravely wounded by a Combine Hunter. Healing her requires Gordon to make a dangerous trek through an Antlion colony to retrieve their &quot;larval extract,&quot; an essential ingredient in the Vortigaunt healing process. As part of the healing process, her life is entwined with Gordon&#x27;s. During this time, the G-Man appears to Gordon in a surreal &quot;heart-to-heart&quot; sequence and programs Alyx to tell her father to &quot;prepare for unforeseen consequences.&quot; Once Alyx awakens, she and Gordon resume their quest toward White Forest. She delivers the Combine data to Dr. Kleiner, who manages to decrypt it and discover that Judith Mossman has found the legendary &quot;Borealis&quot;, an icebreaker ship which has disappeared during teleportation experiments. She delivers the message to her father after the G-Man triggers her programming, and later, two creatures called Advisors break in and kill Eli before Dog saves Gordon and Alyx.

Alyx is the titular playable protagonist of the 2020 virtual reality game &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; developed by Valve. The game follows a 19-year-old Alyx&#x27;s story in City 17 five years before the events of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. Initially performing routine reconnaissance for the Resistance, Alyx is captured along with her father by the Combine after he discovers images relating to an apparent Combine superweapon called &quot;the Vault.&quot; Russell, a Resistance mechanic, frees Alyx and sends her through the zombie-infested Quarantine Zone outside City 17 to rescue Eli. Along the way, Alyx meets an eccentric Vortigaunt who warns her of Eli&#x27;s death in the future. Alyx manages to derail the train sending Eli to Nova Prospekt before discovering that the Vault is actually a prison containing Gordon Freeman. When Alyx reaches the Vault, however, she instead finds the G-Man, who gives her a vision of her father&#x27;s death in exchange for freeing him. He gives her the power to kill the Advisor, saving Eli&#x27;s life, but puts her in stasis to replace Gordon Freeman, causing her to be removed from time.

In 2020, an Alyx-inspired skin was added to the massive multiplayer online obstacle course battle royale game &quot;Fall Guys&quot;.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Episode One&quot;, where Alyx&#x27;s role as a companion is expanded upon, her artificial intelligence (AI) was designed specifically for co-operative play to complement the player&#x27;s abilities. The developers described Alyx&#x27;s programming for &quot;Episode One&quot; as a &quot;personality code&quot; as opposed to an &quot;AI code&quot;, emphasizing the attention they gave to create a unique and believable companion. In addition, she was specially programmed to avoid performing too many mechanical or repetitive actions, such as repeating lines of dialogue or performing certain routines in combat situations.

Examples of this co-operative gameplay include combat in underground levels, where the player can use their flashlight to help Alyx spot and kill oncoming enemies, thereby conserving their own ammunition. Similarly, Alyx will often take up strategic positions and provide covering fire to keep the player safe while they travel to a certain area or perform certain actions.

==Reception==
Since she first appeared in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, Alyx Vance has received positive reviews for both her intelligence and her beauty, among other factors. GamesRadar named Alyx &quot;Miss 2004&quot; due to her intelligence, personality, and design. In its 2010 cover feature, &quot;Game Informer&quot; named Alyx Vance one of 30 most important characters of the 2000s, feeling that she stands apart from female characters who exist for the sake of male characters without putting too much emphasis on her strength and independence. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; staff also considered her one of the best new characters of the decade due to her strong attitude and personality, which they felt was nonstandard for non-playable characters at the time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Darren Franich considered her one of the best female characters, feeling that she was a vital component to the game due to Gordon being a silent protagonist. In 2013&#x27;s &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, the player character&#x27;s female companion Elizabeth was developed by the team to attempt to live up to Alyx Vance in terms of being an AI companion, with developer Ken Levine arguing that AI companions have not been done as well as Alyx.

<doc id="1212163" wikidata="Q959405" url="?curid=1212163" title="Greek National Road 8">
<text>Greek National Road 8 (, abbreviated as EO8, common name: old Athens-Patras national road) is a single carriageway with at-grade intersections in the Attica, Peloponnese and West Greece regions. It connects Athens with the cities of Corinth and Patras. Since the 1960s it has been replaced for most of its length with the National Road 8A, a limited-access toll road that bypasses most towns, as the major route to the Peloponnese. The EO8a has since been upgraded to the A8 motorway.

National Road 8 passes along the northern coast of the Saronic Gulf, through the Isthmus of Corinth and further, along the southern coast of the Gulf of Corinth, and ending in downtown Patras. It runs through five regional units: Central Athens, West Athens, West Attica, Corinthia and Achaea. Since the opening of National Road 8A it is mainly used for local traffic in the coastal towns.

==Original route==
According to the Government Gazette in 1963, the original alignment of EO8 ran from Athens to Patras, via: Corinth, Kiato, Derveni, Aigio and Rio.

==Present route==
Today, the EO8 bypasses Megara, whereas the original alignment ran through the town. In Athens, the EO8 currently runs via Athinon Avenue instead of Iera Odos and Egaleo.

Additionally, the EO8a and the A8 (Athens–Patras) runs parallel to the EO8 from Patras to Eleusis, although it bypasses many villages and towns that the EO8 directly serve. The remaining sections of the EO8a (between Corinth and Rio) will be upgraded to be part of the A8, and the EO8 will become a non-motorway detour.

Apart from the EO8a and A8, the EO8 has connections with (from east to west) the EO1, EO56, A1, EO58, EO3, EO7, EO31, EO5, EO33 and EO9: the EO58, a short airport road to the Eleusis Airbase, also branches off from the EO8.

<text>Absolute is the brand of a long-running series of compilation albums owned by the Swedish record company EVA Records. Initially, the only albums in the series were called &quot;Absolute Music&quot;, but starting in 1990 there have been other themed albums such as &quot;Absolute Dance&quot; and &quot;Absolute Rock&quot;.

==History==
The first &quot;Absolute&quot; album, &quot;Absolute Music 1&quot;, was released on November 11, 1986. The idea to make a compilation with contemporary hits came from the president of Virgin Records, Anders Hjelmtorp, inspired by the successful Now! albums.

During the first years after 1986, the &quot;Absolute&quot; series was a pure collaboration between record companies Virgin, EMI and Elektra. In January 1990 EVA Records was started with Virgin, EMI and BMG as part-owners. In 1991 Warner also became a part-owner.

Since the start, new &quot;Absolute&quot;-albums have been released a few times each year. As of 2020, the latest album in the series is &quot;Absolute Music 89&quot; which was a double album featuring artists like Carola, Zara Larsson and Shawn Mendes. Apart from the main albums in the series (&quot;Absolute&quot; Music) there have also been several themed albums. The first one was &quot;Absolute Italiana&quot; released May 14, 1990. Other examples of themed albums are:

*&quot;Absolute Dance&quot;
*&quot;Absolute Rock&quot;
*&quot;Absolute Love&quot;
*&quot;Absolute Reggae&quot;
*&quot;Absolute Christmas&quot;
*&quot;Absolute Summer&quot;
*&quot;Absolute Kidz&quot;

<text>Care in the Community (also called &quot;Community Care&quot; or &quot;Domiciliary Care&quot;) is a British policy of deinstitutionalisation, treating and caring for physically and mentally disabled people in their homes rather than in an institution. Institutional care was the target of widespread criticism during the 1960s and 1970s, but it was not until 1983 that the government of Margaret Thatcher adopted a new policy of care after the Audit Commission published a report called &#x27;Making a Reality of Community Care&#x27; which outlined the advantages of domiciliary care.

==History==
Although this policy has been attributed to the Margaret Thatcher government in the 1980s, community care was not a new idea. As a policy it had been around since the early 1950s and the 1961 Water Tower speech of Enoch Powell. Its general aim was a more cost-effective way of helping people with mental health problems and physical disabilities, by removing them from impersonal, often Victorian, institutions, and caring for them in their own homes. Since the 1950s various governments had been attracted to the policy of community care. Despite support for the policy, the number of in-patients in large hospitals and residential establishments continued to increase. At the same time, public opinion was gradually turned against long-stay institutions by allegations from the media.

In the 1960s Barbara Robb put together a series of accounts in a book called &quot;Sans Everything&quot; and she used this to launch a campaign to improve or else close long stay facilities. Shortly after this, the brutality and poor care being meted out in Ely Hospital, a long stay hospital for the mentally handicapped in Cardiff, was exposed by a nurse writing to the &quot;News of the World&quot;. This exposure prompted an official enquiry. Its findings were highly critical of conditions, staff morale and management. Rather than bury this report it was in fact deliberately leaked to the papers by the then Secretary of State for Health Richard Crossman, who hoped to obtain increased resources for the health service.

Following the situation at Ely Hospital a series of scandals in mental hospitals hit the headlines. All told similar stories of abuse and inhumane treatment of patients who were out of sight and out of mind of the public, hidden away in institutions. At the same time Michael Ignatieff and Peter Townsend both published books which exposed the poor quality of care within certain institutions. The 1981 ITV documentary Silent Minority which spotlighted the conditions of mental patients at the Borocourt Hospital near Reading, Berkshire and the St Lawrence Hospital in Caterham, Surrey brought the issue into the public eye.

In the 1980s there was increasing criticism and concern about the quality of long term care for dependent people. There was also concern about the experiences of people leaving long term institutional care and being left to fend for themselves in the community. Yet the government was committed to the idea of &#x27;care in the community&#x27;. In 1986 the Audit Commission published a report called &#x27;Making a Reality of Community Care&#x27;. This report outlined the slow progress in resettling people from long stay hospitals. It was this report which prompted the subsequent Green and White papers on community care.

===The Griffiths Report: &#x27;Community Care: Agenda for Action&#x27;===
Sir Roy Griffiths had already been invited by Margaret Thatcher to produce a report on the problems of the NHS. This report was influenced by the ideology of managerialism - the idea that problems could be solved by &#x27;management&#x27;. Griffiths firmly believed that many of the problems facing the Welfare State were caused by the lack of strong effective leadership and management. Because of this previous work, which was greatly admired by the Prime Minister, Griffiths was asked to examine the whole system of community care. In 1988 he produced a report or a Green Paper called &#x27;Community Care: Agenda for Action&#x27;, also known as The Griffiths Report.

The Griffiths Report Proposed a solution to the issue of &#x27;no-man&#x27;s land&#x27; - the between health and social services which included the long term or continuing care of dependent groups such as older people, the disabled and the mentally ill.
In 1988 Griffiths said that community care was &quot;everybody&#x27;s distant cousin but nobody&#x27;s baby -&quot; meaning that community care was not working because no one wanted to accept the responsibility for community care.

Community Care: Agenda for Action made six key recommendations for action:

# Minister of State for Community Care to ensure implementation of the policy - it required ministerial authority.
# Local Authorities should have key role in community care. i.e. Social Work / Services departments rather than Health have responsibility for long term and continuing care. Health Boards to have responsibility for primary and acute care.
# Specific grant from central government to fund development of community care.
# Specified what Social Service Departments should do: assess care needs of locality, set up mechanisms to assess care needs of individuals, on basis of needs - design &#x27;flexible packages of care&#x27; to meet these needs
# Promote the use of the Independent sector: this was to be achieved by social work departments collaborating with and making maximum use of the voluntary and private sector of welfare.
# Social Services should be responsible for registration and inspection of all residential homes whether run by private organisations or the local authority.

The majority of long term care was already being provided by Social Services, but Griffiths proposed putting community nursing staff under the control of local authority rather than Health Boards. This, however, never actually happened. The Griffiths Report on Community Care seemed to back local government whereas, the health board reforms in the same period, actually strengthened central government control.

===1989 white paper &quot;Caring for People&quot;===
In 1989 the government published its response to the Griffiths Report in the White Paper &quot;Caring for People: Community Care in the next Decade and Beyond&quot;. This was a companion paper to &quot;Working for Patients&quot; and shared the same general principles:
* A belief that state provision was bureaucratic and inefficient. That the state should be an &#x27;enabler&#x27; rather than a provider of care. The UK state at this time was funding, providing and purchasing care for the population
* Separation of the purchaser / provider roles
* Devolution of budgets and budgetary control

===&quot;Caring for People&quot; key objectives===
The White Paper followed the main recommendations of the Griffiths Report but with two notable exceptions:
* The White Paper did not propose a Minister of Community Care
* It did not offer a new system of earmarked funds for social care along the lines advised by Griffiths.

It did however; identify six key objectives which differed slightly from Griffiths Report:
* New funding structure
* Promotion of the independent sector
* Agency responsibilities clearly defined
* Development of needs assessment and care management
* Promotion of domiciliary, day and respite care
* Development of practical support for carers

These objectives were legislated for in the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990.

==Aims of the policy==
The main aim of community care policy has always been to maintain individuals in their own homes wherever possible, rather than provide care in a long-stay institution or residential establishment. It was almost taken for granted that this policy was the best option from a humanitarian and moral perspective. It was also thought to be cheaper.

The Guillebaud Committee, reporting in 1956, summed up the assumption underlying policy. It suggested that:

&quot;Policy should aim at making adequate provision wherever possible for the care and treatment of old people in their own homes. The development of domiciliary services will be a genuine economy measure and also a humanitarian measure enabling people to lead the life they much prefer&quot;

Three key objectives of Community Care policy:
* The overriding objective was to cap public expenditure on independent sector residential and nursing home care. This was achieved in that local authorities became responsible for operating a needs-based yet cash-limited system.
* There was a clear agenda about developing a mixed economy of care, i.e. a variety of providers. The mixed economy provision in residential and nursing home care has been maintained despite the social security budget being capped. There are also now many independent organisations providing domiciliary care services.
* To redefine the boundaries between health and social care. Much of the continuing care of elderly and disabled people was provided by the NHS. Now much of that has been re-defined as social care and is the responsibility of local authorities. Whereas NHS services are free, social services have to be paid for.

==Impact of the reforms==
The community care reforms outlined in the 1990 Act came into effect in April 1993. They have been evaluated but no clear conclusions have been reached. A number of authors have been highly critical of the reforms. Hadley and Clough (1996) claim the reforms &#x27;have created care in chaos&#x27; (Hadley and Clough 1996), claiming the reforms have been inefficient, unresponsive, and have offered no choice or equity.

Means and Smith (1998) also claim that the reforms:
* introduced a system that is no better than the previous more bureaucratic systems of resource allocation
* were an excellent idea, but received little understanding or commitment from social services as the lead agency in community care
* the enthusiasm of local authorities was undermined by vested professional interests, or the service legacy of the last forty years
* health services and social services workers have not worked well together and there have been few &#x27;multidisciplinary&#x27; assessments carried out
* in reality little collaboration took place except at senior management level
* the reforms have been undermined by chronic underfunding by central government
* the voluntary sector was the main beneficiary of this attempt to develop a &quot;mixed economy of care&quot;

==Mental health and community care==

Under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, people with mental health problems were able to remain in their own homes whilst undergoing treatment. This situation raised some concerns when acts of violence were perpetrated against members of the public by a small minority of people who had previously been in psychiatric hospitals. However, research by King&#x27;s College London in 2013 showed that psychiatric patients are actually three times as likely to be victims of crime than the general public.

The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 was passed so that patients could be individually assessed, and assigned a specific care worker. In the unlikely event that they presented a risk they were to be placed on a Supervision Register. There have been problems with patients &quot;slipping through the net&quot; and ending up homeless on the street. There have also been arguments between Health and Social Services departments over who should pay.

In January 1998, the then Labour Health Secretary, Frank Dobson, said the care in the community programme launched by the Conservatives had failed.

As Simon Duffy and others have emphasised, needs assessments were often distorted so a person&#x27;s &quot;needs&quot; were interpreted to fit the available resources. The development of personal budgets, where the person was given control of resources, rather than provided with services, was intended to tackle this problem.

==Winterbourne View Panorama==
BBC Panorama in 2011 filmed a fly-on-the-wall documentary at Winterbourne View, which was a private long-term hospital for people with learning disability. This was done in response to disclosures of alleged abuse and of a failure of the authorities, including the regulator to take action on reports of abuse.

The broadcast programme showed physical and verbal abuse of people, a culture of frustration and boredom, and lack of any structured treatment for the inpatients.

After this, health authorities promised to reduce the number of placements in large units where people were cared for inadequately, far from home, and on a long term basis. It was planned to have a reduction in the number of these placements, with alternative more satisfactory small scale services provided. However, after four years, the Bubb report highlighted that there had been little change, and proposed the way forward for service improvement. It advocated listening to, and empowering people with disability and their families, and the use of smaller, more local services with different kinds of funding.

In March 2015 Norman Lamb, the Minister of State for Care and Support launched a twelve-week consultation process on how the changes to services should be implemented. While welcomed by most, others saw progress as lamentably slow on the identified issues for what amounts to community care for people with learning disability and autism. Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, on hearing the outlined plans of the health service on these proposed changes, said:

″Why can&#x27;t we just get on and do it? To say it&#x27;s going to go into a green paper fills me with horror. It suggests to me that our successors will be sitting round the table in a couple of years’ time having the same conversation.”

<doc id="1212182" wikidata="Q2658686" url="?curid=1212182" title="Diffuse axonal injury">
<text>Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a brain injury in which scattered lesions occur over a widespread area in white matter tracts as well as grey matter. DAI is one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic brain injury and is a major cause of unconsciousness and persistent vegetative state after severe head trauma. It occurs in about half of all cases of severe head trauma and may be the primary damage that occurs in concussion. The outcome is frequently coma, with over 90% of patients with severe DAI never regaining consciousness. Those who awaken from the coma often remain significantly impaired.

DAI can occur across the spectrum of traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity, wherein the burden of injury increases from mild to severe. Concussion may be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury.

==Mechanism==
DAI is the result of traumatic shearing forces that occur when the head is rapidly accelerated or decelerated, as may occur in car accidents, falls, and assaults. Vehicle accidents are the most frequent cause of DAI; it can also occur as the result of child abuse such as in shaken baby syndrome.

Immediate disconnection of axons may be observed in severe brain injury, but the major damage of DAI is delayed secondary axon disconnections, slowly developed over an extended time course. Tracts of axons, which appear white due to myelination, are referred to as white matter. Lesions in both grey and white matter are found in postmortem brains in CT and MRI exams.

Besides mechanical breakage of the axonal cytoskeleton, DAI pathology also includes secondary physiological changes, such as interrupted axonal transport, progressive swellings known as axonal varicosities, and degeneration. Recent studies have linked these changes to twisting and misalignment of broken axon microtubules, as well as tau protein and amyloid precursor protein (APP) deposition.

==Characteristics==
Lesions typically are found in the white matter of brains injured by DAI; these lesions vary in size from about 1–15 mm and are distributed in a characteristic pattern. DAI most commonly affects white matter in areas including the brain stem, the corpus callosum, and the cerebral hemispheres.

The lobes of the brain most likely to be injured are the frontal and temporal lobes. Other common locations for DAI include the white matter in the cerebral cortex, the superior cerebral peduncles, basal ganglia, thalamus, and deep hemispheric nuclei. These areas may be more easily damaged because of the difference in density between them and the other regions of the brain.

===Histological characteristics===
DAI is characterized by axonal separation, in which the axon is torn at the site of stretch and the part distal to the tear degrades by a process known as Wallerian degeneration. While it was once thought that the main cause of axonal separation was tearing due to mechanical forces during the trauma event, it is now understood that axons are not typically torn upon impact; rather, secondary biochemical cascades, which occur in response to the primary injury (which occurs as the result of mechanical forces at the moment of trauma) and take place hours to days after the initial injury, are largely responsible for the damage to axons.

Though the processes involved in secondary brain injury are still poorly understood, it is now accepted that stretching of axons during injury causes physical disruption to and proteolytic degradation of the cytoskeleton. It also opens sodium channels in the axolemma, which causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open and Ca2+ to flow into the cell. The intracellular presence of Ca2+ triggers several different pathways, including activating phospholipases and proteolytic enzymes damaging mitochondria and the cytoskeleton, and activating secondary messengers, which can lead to separation of the axon and death of the cell.

===Cytoskeleton disruption===
Axons are normally elastic, but when rapidly stretched they become brittle, and the axonal cytoskeleton can be broken. Misalignment of cytoskeletal elements after stretch injury can lead to tearing of the axon and death of the neuron. Axonal transport continues up to the point of the break in the cytoskeleton, but no further, leading to a buildup of transport products and local swelling at that point. When this swelling becomes large enough, it can tear the axon at the site of the cytoskeleton break, causing it to draw back toward the cell body and form a bulb. This bulb is called a &quot;retraction ball&quot;, the histological hallmark of diffuse axonal injury.

When the axon is torn, Wallerian degeneration, in which the part of the axon distal to the break degrades, takes place within one to two days after injury. The axolemma disintegrates, myelin breaks down and begins to detach from the cell in an anterograde direction (from the body of the cell toward the end of the axon), and nearby cells begin phagocytic activity, engulfing the cellular debris.

===Calcium influx===
While sometimes only the cytoskeleton is disturbed, frequently disruption of the axolemma occurs as well, causing the influx of Ca2+ ions into the cell and unleashing a variety of degradational processes. An increase in Ca2+ and Na+ levels and a drop in K+ levels are found within the axon immediately after injury. Possible routes of Ca2+ entry include sodium channels, pores formed in the membrane during stretch, and failure of ATP-dependent transporters due to mechanical blockage or lack of available metabolic energy. High levels of intracellular Ca2+, the major cause of post-injury cell damage, destroy mitochondria, and trigger phospholipases and proteolytic enzymes that damage Na+ channels and degrade or alter the cytoskeleton and the axoplasm. Excess Ca2+ can also lead to damage to the blood–brain barrier and swelling of the brain.

One of the proteins activated by the presence of calcium in the cell is calpain, a Ca2+-dependent non-lysosomal protease. About 15 minutes to half an hour after the onset of injury, a process called calpain-mediated spectrin proteolysis, or CMSP, begins to occur. Calpain breaks down a molecule called spectrin, which holds the membrane onto the cytoskeleton, causing the formation of blebs and the breakdown of the cytoskeleton and the membrane, and ultimately the death of the cell. Other molecules that can be degraded by calpains are microtubule subunits, microtubule-associated proteins, and neurofilaments.

Generally occurring one to six hours into the process of post-stretch injury, the presence of calcium in the cell initiates the caspase cascade, a process in cell injury that usually leads to apoptosis, or &quot;programmed cell death&quot;.

Mitochondria, dendrites, and parts of the cytoskeleton damaged in the injury have a limited ability to heal and regenerate, a process which occurs over two or more weeks. After the injury, astrocytes can shrink, causing parts of the brain to atrophy.

==Diagnosis==

DAI is difficult to detect since it does not show up well on CT scans or with other macroscopic imaging techniques, though it shows up microscopically. However, there are characteristics typical of DAI that may or may not show up on a CT scan. Diffuse injury has more microscopic injury than macroscopic injury and is difficult to detect with CT and MRI, but its presence can be inferred when small bleeds are visible in the corpus callosum or the cerebral cortex. MRI is more useful than CT for detecting characteristics of diffuse axonal injury in the subacute and chronic time frames. Newer studies such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging are able to demonstrate the degree of white matter fiber tract injury even when the standard MRI is negative. Since axonal damage in DAI is largely a result of secondary biochemical cascades, it has a delayed onset, so a person with DAI who initially appears well may deteriorate later. Thus injury is frequently more severe than is realized, and medical professionals should suspect DAI in any patients whose CT scans appear normal but who have symptoms like unconsciousness.

MRI is more sensitive than CT scans, but is still liable to false negatives because DAI is identified by looking for signs of edema, which may not always be present.

DAI is classified into grades based on severity of the injury. In Grade I, widespread axonal damage is present but no focal abnormalities are seen. In Grade II, damage found in Grade I is present in addition to focal abnormalities, especially in the corpus callosum. Grade III damage encompasses both Grades I and II plus rostral brain stem injury and often tears in the tissue.

==Treatment==
DAI currently lacks specific treatment beyond that for any type of head injury, which includes stabilizing the patient and trying to limit increases in intracranial pressure (ICP).

==History==
The idea of DAI first came about as a result of studies by Sabina Strich on lesions of the white matter of individuals who had sustained head trauma years before. Strich first proposed the idea in 1956, calling it &quot;diffuse degeneration of white matter&quot;; however, the more concise term &quot;diffuse axonal injury&quot; came to be preferred. Strich was researching the relationship between dementia and head trauma and asserted in 1956 that DAI played an integral role in the eventual development of dementia due to head trauma. The term DAI was introduced in the early 1980s.

==Notable examples==
* &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Richard Hammond sustained a DAI as a result of the &quot;Vampire&quot; dragster crash in 2006.
* Champ Car World Series driver Roberto Guerrero suffered a DAI as a result of a crash during testing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1987.
* Formula 1 driver Jules Bianchi suffered a DAI as a result of an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix and died without regaining consciousness 9 months later.
* Actor and audiobook narrator Frank Muller, who read Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, suffered a DAI in 2001 due to a motorcycle accident. He died in 2008.
* NASCAR driver Adam Petty, grandson of seven time Cup Series champion Richard Petty, sustained a diffuse axonal injury secondary to a fatal basilar skull fracture in May 2000 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway during practice for the upcoming race.

<text>Whitmell Hill (February 12, 1743 – September 26, 1797) was an American planter from Martin County, North Carolina and commander of the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution. He was a delegate for North Carolina to the Continental Congress from 1778 to 1780 and served as Speaker of the North Carolina House of Commons in 1778.

==Early life==
Whitmell was the son of a John and Martha Hill, and was born in Bertie County, North Carolina. In 1760 he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and returned to North Carolina to begin developing his own plantation, &quot;Hill’s Ferry&quot;, in what was to become Martin County when it was established in 1774.

==Service in the American Revolution==
Service record:
* Lt. Colonel in the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1775-1778)
* Colonel over the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1778 &amp; 1781-1783)
* North Carolina delegate to the Continental Congress (1778-1780)

Hill supported the rising revolutionary sentiment, and when the Martin County Regiment of the North Carolina militia was organized he was named its Lieutenant Colonel, and was later its Colonel in 1778. When the revolutionary North Carolina Provincial Congress met in 1775-1776 he represented Martin County. Then, in 1776 he was advanced to the Provincial Council to represent the Edenton district. During this time he was also a member of the local Committee of Safety.

==Political career==
Once North Carolina wrote its new Constitution, Hill was elected to the state Senate, and served as speaker in 1778. Later that year the Assembly named him as one of the state&#x27;s delegates to the Continental Congress. He was returned to the Congress until 1781, when the term limit imposed by the state constitution prevented his reappointment. He was re-elected to the state Senate in 1783, 1784, and 1788. In 1788 he was also a delegate to North Carolina&#x27;s Hillsborough Convention to consider ratification of the U.S. Constitution. His outspoken support helped strengthen the forces that ultimately completed ratification the following year in Fayetteville.

==Death==
Hill died and was buried at his home, &quot;Hill’s Ferry&quot;, in northwestern Martin County. In 1887 his grave was moved to the Trinity Cemetery, near Scotland Neck in Halifax County, North Carolina.

<text>The Transylvanian Saxons (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Siweberjer Såksen&quot; or simply &quot;Soxen&quot;, singularly &quot;Sox&quot; or &quot;Soax&quot;; Transylvanian Landler: &quot;Soxn&quot; or &quot;Soxisch&quot;; ; seldom &quot;sași ardeleni/transilvăneni/transilvani&quot;; ) are a people of mainly German ethnicity and overall Germanic origin—mostly Luxembourgish and from the Low Countries initially during the medieval Ostsiedlung process, then also from other parts of present-day Germany—who settled in Transylvania in various waves, starting from the mid and mid-late 12th century until the mid 19th century. 

The first ancestors of the Transylvanian &#x27;Saxons&#x27; originally stemmed from Flanders, Hainaut, Brabant, Liège, Zeeland, Moselle, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, then situated in the north-western territories of the Holy Roman Empire around the 1140s and 1150s.

Alongside the Baltic Germans from Estonia and Latvia and the Zipser Germans (also sometimes known or referred to as &quot;Zipser Saxons&quot;) from Zips, northeastern Slovakia, as well as Maramureș and Bucovina, the Transylvanian Saxons are one of the three eldest German-speaking and ethnic German groups of the German diaspora in Central-Eastern Europe, having continuously been living there since the High Middle Ages onwards. The Transylvanian Saxons are part of the broader group of Romanian Germans as well, being the eldest and one of the most important of all the constituent sub-groups of this ethnic community.

Their native dialect, Transylvanian Saxon is close to Luxembourgish. Nowadays, organisations representing the Transylvanian Saxons exist in Romania, Germany, Austria, Canada, and the United States (in the latter case most notably &#x27;Alliance of Transylvanian Saxons&#x27;). Other smaller communities of Transylvanian Saxons can be found in South Africa and Australia as well as South America (for example in Argentina).

== Background ==
The legal foundation of their settlement in southern, southeastern, and northeastern Transylvania was officially stipulated within the Diploma Andreanum (, &quot;The Golden Charter of the Transylvanian Saxons&quot;, ) issued by King Andrew II of Hungary which allocated them the royal land () under local autonomy known as &quot;Königsboden&quot; or &quot;Fundus Regius&quot; in Latin.

The ancestors of the modern Transylvanian Saxons originally came from the contemporary Low Countries (more specifically the regions of Flanders, Hainaut, Brabant, Liège, or Zeeland) as well as the Moselle and Lorraine river valleys, and Luxembourg as well, then situated in the north-western territories of the Holy Roman Empire around the 1140s. 

Further or subsequent waves of German colonists in Transylvania also stemmed from more southern regions of present-day Germany such as Thuringia or even Bavaria (the latter particularly valid for the Saxons in northeastern Transylvania). The initial waves of Transylvanian Saxons were referred to as &quot;hospites flandrenses et teutonici&quot; or &quot;primi hospites regni&quot; in Latin, literally &quot;the Flemish and Teutonic guests&quot; or &quot;the first guests of the kingdom&quot; (i.e. of the former Kingdom of Hungary).

For centuries, the main tasks of the Transylvanian Saxons during the High Middle Ages were to protect the easternmost frontiers of the former Kingdom of Hungary against certain invading migratory Asiatic peoples, to bring more agriculture to the region, to instil Central European culture, enhance trade, and boost urbanisation and overall economic development. In the process of fortifying the borders of the Kingdom of Hungary to the east, they were early on helped by the Teutonic Knights. Later on, they had to further strengthen their hometowns and rural settlements against the expanding Ottoman Empire which posed a major threat from the south. The rural settlements were more protected with a series of fortified churches known as &#x27;kirchenburgen&#x27; in standard German. An alternative term for them in standard German is also &#x27;wehrkirchen&#x27; (i.e. fortified churches).

During the Modern Age, they favoured more and more the Romanians for the latter to obtain increased and rightful political, social, and cultural rights before the Hungarian nobility, with Transylvanian Saxon intellectuals pleading for the Latinity of the Romanian language and the Romanian people. They were subsequently allied with the Transylvanian Romanians and thus sided with the Austrian Empire in the context of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.

After 1918 and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, in the wake of the Treaty of Trianon (signed in 1920), Transylvania united with the Kingdom of Romania, after the Transylvanian Saxons also voted for the union with the Romanian kingdom in February 1919. Consequently, the Transylvanian Saxons, together with other ethnic German sub-groups in then newly enlarged Kingdom of Romania (namely the Banat Swabians, Sathmar Swabians, Bessarabia Germans, Bukovina Germans, and Zipser Germans), became part of that country&#x27;s broader German minority. Today, relatively few still live in Romania, where the second last official census (carried out in 2011) indicated 36,042 Germans, out of which only 11,400 were of Transylvanian Saxon descent. As per the latest Romanian census conducted in 2022, they are even fewer, as other sub-groups of the entire German community in Romania as well.

== Historical overview ==



The colonization of Transylvania by ethnic Germans later collectively known as &quot;Transylvanian Saxons&quot; began under the reign of King Géza II of Hungary (1141–1162). For several consecutive centuries, the main task of these medieval German-speaking settlers (as that of the Szeklers for example in the east of Transylvania) was to defend the southern, southeastern, and northeastern borders of the then Kingdom of Hungary against foreign invaders stemming most notably from Central Asia and even far East Asia (e.g. Cumans, Pechenegs, Mongols, and Tatars). At the same time, the Saxons were also charged with developing agriculture and introducing Central European culture. Later on, the Saxons needed to further fortify both their rural and urban settlements against invading Ottomans (or against the invading and expanding Ottoman Empire). The Saxons in northeastern Transylvania were also in charge of mining. They can be perceived as being quite related to the Zipser Saxons from present-day Spiš (), north-eastern Slovakia (as well as other historical regions of contemporary Romania, namely Maramureș and Bukovina) given the fact they are two of the oldest ethnic German groups in non-native German-speaking Central and Eastern Europe.

The first wave of settlement continued well until the end of the 13th century. Although the colonists came mostly from the western Holy Roman Empire, they came to be collectively referred to as &#x27;Saxons&#x27; because of Germans working for the royal Hungarian chancellery. 

Gradually, the type of medieval German once spoken by these settlers, craftsmen, guardsmen, miners, and various other workers became locally known as &quot;Såksesch&quot; (i.e. Transylvanian Saxon; in its longest form &quot;Siweberjesch-Såksesch&quot;) and remains, still to this day, very closely related to Luxembourgish with which it shares many lexical similarities.

The Transylvanian Saxon population has been steadily decreasing since World War II as they started leaving the territory of present-day Romania en masse during and after World War II, relocating initially to Austria, then predominantly to southern Germany (especially in Bavaria).

The process of emigration continued during communist rule in Romania. After the collapse of the Ceaușescu regime in 1989 and the fall of the East German communist government, many of them continued to emigrate to unified Germany. As a result, today only approximately 12,000 Saxons remain in Romania.

Nowadays, the vast majority of Transylvanian Saxons live in either Germany or Austria. Nonetheless, a sizable Transylvanian Saxon population also resides today in North America, most notably in the United States (specifically in Idaho, Ohio, and Colorado as well as in Canada, southern Ontario more precisely).

On the history of the Transylvanian Saxons, former federal German president and professor doctor Theodor Heuss (FDP) stated, namely: &quot;...their history is a piece of German history as a whole...&quot;.

== Origins and medieval settlements ==



The initial phase of German settlement in Transylvania began in the mid and mid-late 12th century, with colonists travelling to and residing in what would later become known in standard German as (i.e. Țara Oltului in Romanian, after the German name for the Olt river, or the old land as in a word for word translation from German) or , based around the picturesque well preserved medieval town of , today&#x27;s Sibiu. Additionally, the surrounding areas of the present-day town of Sibiu/Hermannstadt (former European Capital of Culture in 2007 alongside Luxembourg City) were formed of marshlands in the High Middle Ages. This is further hinted but also highlighted in the coat of arms of the town of Sibiu/Hermannstadt () by the water lily included therein.

These German settlers were invited by Géza II. Although the primary reason for Géza II&#x27;s invitation was border defence, similar to employing the Szeklers against foreign invaders in the east of Transylvania, Germans were also sought for their mining expertise as well as the ability to develop the region&#x27;s economy. Most colonists to this area came from Luxembourg (Luxembourgish: &quot;Lëtzebuerg&quot;) and the Moselle River region (see for instance &quot;Medardus de Nympz&quot;, former knight and founder of the fortified village of Niemesch/Nemșa in Moșna).

A second phase of German settlement during the early 13th century consisted of settlers primarily stemming from the Rhineland region, the southern Low Countries, and the Moselle region, with others from Thuringia, Bavaria, and even from France. A settlement in northeastern Transylvania was centered on the town of , the later (), located on the Bistrița River. The surrounding area became known as the . That area was important for mining in the Middle Ages.

Continued immigration from the Empire expanded the area of the Saxons further to the east. Settlers from the Hermannstadt region spread into the Hârtibaciu River valley () and to the foot of the Cibin () and Sebeș () mountains.

The latter region, centered around the town of (), was known as . To the north of Hermannstadt they settled what they called the including the village of (Latin for /) near (). Allegedly, the term &quot;Saxon&quot; was applied to all Germans of these historical regions because the first German settlers who came to the Kingdom of Hungary were either poor miners or groups of convicts from Saxony.

In 1211, King Andrew II of Hungary invited the Teutonic Knights to settle and defend the in the southeastern corner of Transylvania. To guard the mountain passes of the Carpathians () against the Cumans, the knights constructed numerous castles and towns, including the major city of (). 

Alarmed by the knights&#x27; rapidly expanding power, in 1225 King Andrew II expelled the Teutonic Order from Transylvania permanently, which henceforth relocated to Prussia in 1226, although the colonists remained in . The Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s medieval eastern borders were therefore defended in the northeast by the Saxons, in the east by the Hungarian border guard tribe of the Székelys, in the southeast by the castles built by the Teutonic Knights and Saxons and in the south by the Altland Saxons.

A common interpretation of the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, dated to 26 June 1284 and recorded in Hamelin records that (the earliest of such records dating from 1384: &quot;It is 100 years since our children left&quot;) when a group of 130 children from the town of Hamelin (), in present-day Lower Saxony, were led away from their hometown by a piper (who may be a folk memory of a lokator) is that this related to an emigration event as part of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; (i.e. Eastern settlement). The destination is usually supposed to have been Prignitz, Uckermark, and Pomerania, but a minor alternative theory suggests settlement in Transylvania.

=== The proper usage of the term Saxon in the context of medieval Transylvania ===

In the context of medieval Transylvania, the term &quot;Saxon&quot; was used to denote a nobleman&#x27;s title and not necessarily someone who was German-speaking. In these regards, the Saxon title could have been awarded to someone who was a non-native German speaker as well. Not all Transylvanian Saxon settlers were German-speaking given the fact that they also stemmed from the contemporary Low Countries (i.e. aside from Luxembourg, also contemporary Netherlands and Belgium) and from modern day France as well. Additionally, it is equally important to mention the fact that the family name &#x27;Sas&#x27; or &#x27;Sasu&#x27; in Romanian and &#x27;Szász&#x27; respectively in Hungarian could denote both an ethnic lineage as well as a social liaison to the Saxon title awarded in Transylvania during the High Middle Ages.

=== Transylvanian Saxon ethnic consciousness ===

Hence, taking in consideration the aforementioned regarding the Saxon title in high medieval Transylvania, the Transylvanian Saxons&#x27; ethnic consciousness subsequently solidified after the first waves of settlers from Western Europe arrived in the region and was further reinforced or revitalised with new waves of settlers from central and southern present-day Germany during the Modern Age, more specifically during the 19th century. Furthermore, Transylvanian Saxon intellectual Stephan Ludwig Roth also pleaded for a strengthening of the German element in Transylvania during the 19th century by means of subsequent waves of settlers stemming from contemporary Germany while at the same time firstly supporting the rights of the ethnic Romanians.

== Medieval organization ==

=== Legal organization ===



Although the Teutonic Knights had left Transylvania, the Saxon colonists remained, and the king allowed them to retain the rights and obligations included within the &quot;Diploma Andreanum&quot; of 1224 by Hungarian King Andrew II. This document conferred upon the German population of the territory between Drăușeni (, ) and Orăștie (, ) both administrative and religious autonomy and defined their obligations towards the Hungarian monarchs. Consequently, they had to pay yearly tax to the king and provide military contributions to the royal army in case of danger of attack from abroad.

Otherwise, they enjoyed suzerainty; even Hungarians could not settle down in the Saxon territories. The territory colonized by Germans covered an area of about 30,000 km2 (10,000 sq. mi.). The region was called Royal Lands or Saxon Lands (; ; ; ). During the reign of Hungarian King Charles I (probably 1325–1329; also referred to as &quot;Charles Robert d&#x27;Anjou&quot;), the Saxons were organized in the Saxon Chairs (or seats) as follows:

The territorial extent of the aforementioned Saxon seats can be clearly seen in depth in the maps from the gallery below:

Aside from the Saxon seats, there had also been two districts, namely Bistritz/Bistrița and Kronstadt/Brașov, which had the following territorial extent, as depicted in the maps below:

=== Religious organizations ===

Along with the Teutonic Order, other religious organizations important to the development of German communities were the Cistercian abbeys of Igrisch (Igriș) in the Banat region respectively Kerz (Cârța) in Fogaraschland (Țara Făgărașului). The earliest religious organization of the Saxons was the Provostship of Hermannstadt (now Sibiu), founded 20 December 1191. In its early years, it included the territories of Hermannstadt, Leschkirch (Nocrich), and Groß-Schenk (Cincu), the areas that were colonized the earliest by ethnic Germans in the region.

Under the influence of Johannes Honterus, the great majority of the Transylvanian Saxons embraced the new creed of Martin Luther during the Protestant Reformation. The first superintendent of the Saxons Evangelical Church, Paul Wiener, was elected by Saxon pastors at a synod on 6 February 1553.

Almost all became Lutheran Protestants, with very few Calvinists, while other minor segments of the Transylvanian Saxon society remained staunchly Catholic (of Latin Church, more specifically) or were converted to Catholicism later on. Nonetheless, one of the consequences of the Reformation was the emergence of an almost perfect equivalence, in the Transylvanian context, of the terms Lutheran and Saxon, with the Lutheran Church in Transylvania being de facto a &quot;Volkskirche&quot;, i.e. the &quot;national church&quot; of the Transylvanian Saxons (or the people&#x27;s church of the Saxons).

== Fortification of the towns ==

The Mongol invasion of 1241–42 devastated much of the Kingdom of Hungary. Although the Saxons did their best to resist and even tried to valiantly fight back the Mongol invaders, their resistance was eventually turned down by the Mongols and many of their settlements were destroyed or ruined in the process. After the Mongols retreated from Transylvania, in the event of another invasion, many Transylvanian towns were fortified with stone castles and an emphasis was put on developing towns economically. In the Middle Ages, approximately 300 villages were defended by the &quot;Kirchenburgen&quot;, or fortified churches with massive walls and watch towers.

Although many of these fortified churches have fallen into either decay or ruin, nowadays the south-eastern region of Transylvania still has one of the highest density of existing fortified churches from the 13th to 16th centuries as more than 150 villages in the area count various types of fortified churches in good shape, seven of them being included in the UNESCO World Heritage under the name of &quot;Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania&quot;. The rapid expansion of cities populated by the Saxons led to Transylvania being known in German as &quot;Siebenbürgen&quot; and &quot;Septem Castra&quot; or &quot;Septem Castrensis&quot; in Latin, referring to seven of the fortified towns (see Historical names of Transylvania), most likely:

* Nösen/Bistritz (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Bästerts&quot;)
* Hermannstadt (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Härmeschtat&quot;/&quot;Hermestatt&quot;)
* Klausenburg ()
* Kronstadt (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Kruhnen&quot;)
* Mediasch (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Medwesch&quot;/&quot;Medwisch&quot;)
* Mühlbach (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Melnbach&quot;/&quot;Mühllenbach&quot;)
* Schässburg/Schäßburg (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Schäsbrich&quot;)

Other potential candidates for this list include:

* Broos (, Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Brooss&quot;)
* Sächsisch-Regen (, Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Reen&quot;)

Other notable urban Saxon settlements include:
* Heltau (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Hielt&quot;)
* Rosenau ( Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Ruusenåå&quot;)
* Reps (; Transylvanian Saxon: &quot;Räppes&quot;)

== Fortification of the villages ==

In addition to fortifying their towns over the passing of time, the Transylvanian Saxons also had to fortify their villages by building their fortified churches (the Transylvanian Saxons were initially strongly Roman Catholic then Evangelical Lutheran after the Reformation). 

These fortified churches, or &quot;kirchenburgen&quot; as they are known in standard German, had defensive capacities in the event of a foreign attack on a rural Transylvanian Saxon community (e.g. extensive inner and outer walls and a fortified watch tower). Such an attack would often stem from the Cumans, for example, or from the Pechenegs. It was estimated that there are approximately 300 such villages with fortified churches built by the Saxons in Transylvania during the Middle Ages. 

The majority of them are still in very good to relatively good shape to this day, after further consolidation and renovation based on European funds or Norwegian grants (for example in Alma Vii or Laslea), but also based on foreign donations. Nevertheless, there also some still left in ruin or decay, since the vast majority of the Saxons in their respective villages left them deserted during either before 1989 and after 1989 while emigrating for Western Europe or North America.

== Medieval colonies outside the Carpathian arch ==

The Transylvanian Saxons also colonized areas outside the Carpathian arch, and, implicitly, outside their then newly native lands across Transylvania starting in the mid and mid-late 12th century. Those areas pertained to the neighbouring and emerging Romanian medieval principalities of Moldavia (to the east) and Wallachia (to the south).

In this particular process, they founded or co-founded major historical settlements on the territory of both aforementioned Romanian principalities such as Târgu Neamț (), Baia (), Târgoviște (), or Câmpulung (). In the case of the first settlement (i.e. Târgu Neamț), they could have been equally helped in establishing it by the Teutonic Knights. Saxons in Wallachia also settled in Râmnic (i.e. present-day Râmnicu Vâlcea) and Pitești ().

Saxon colonization in Moldavia had likely occurred through a crossing from the Bistrița area eastward and northward whereas Saxon colonization in Wallachia had likely occurred from the Sibiu () area. Moreover, under the title of Schultheiß (), ethnic Germans were even briefly in charge of some of these Romanian settlements during the High Middle Ages.

Additionally, German potters and merchants were also present in the former Moldavian capital of Suceava at the end of the 14th century. Historically, the town of Suceava has also been known in Old High German as &quot;Sedschopff&quot;. It is therefore known that Suceava had a small yet influent and thriving community of Transylvanian Saxons in medieval times.

The newly arrived Saxons outside the Carpathian arch in the emerging medieval Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia brought urbanisation, craftsmanship, trade, and the so-called &quot;German law&quot;, under which the local administrations of medieval Romanian towns had operated in the beginning.

In the medieval towns situated in the highlands of the Principality of Moldavia (or what would later become Bukovina starting in the Modern Age), namely Suceava or Câmpulung Moldovenesc (), the type of German town law which operated there was the Magdeburg law. Furthermore, the Teutonic Knights were also present in Siret () where they built a fortress on a hill near the town during the early 13th century.

However, throughout the passing of time, demographically, their numbers gradually dwindled and had been subsequently assimilated in the local medieval Wallachian and Moldavian cultures by the overwhelming Romanian ethnic majority.

== Status of privileged class in Transylvania ==



Along with the largely Hungarian-Transylvanian nobility and the Székelys, the Transylvanian Saxons were members of the Unio Trium Nationum (or &#x27;Union of the Three Nations&#x27;), which was a charter signed in 1438. This agreement preserved a considerable degree of political rights for the three aforementioned groups but excluded the largely Hungarian and Romanian peasantry from political life in the principality.

During the Protestant Reformation, most Transylvanian Saxons converted to Lutheranism. As the semi-independent Principality of Transylvania was one of the most religiously tolerant states in Europe at the time, the Saxons were allowed to practice their own religion (meaning that they enjoyed religious autonomy). However, the Habsburgs still promoted Roman Catholicism to the Saxons during the Counter-Reformation. Currently in Romania, about 60% of ethnic Germans reported being Roman Catholic and 40% Protestant (see Religion in Romania).

Warfare between the Habsburg monarchy and Hungary against the Ottoman Empire from the 16th–18th centuries decreased the population of Transylvanian Saxons. All throughout this period of time, the Saxons in Transylvania served as administrators and military officers. When the Principality of Transylvania came under Habsburg control, a smaller third phase of settlement took place to revitalise their demographics.

This wave of settlement included exiled Protestants from Upper Austria (the Transylvanian Landlers namely), who were given land near Hermannstadt (Sibiu). The predominantly German-populated Hermannstadt was a noteworthy cultural center within Transylvania in the past, while Kronstadt (Brașov) represented a vital political center for the Transylvanian Saxons. Brașov/Kronstadt was more populous compared to Sibiu/Hermannstadt but historically the latter remained the most important town in Transylvania for the Transylvanian Saxons (as a well as a very important town for the Transylvanian Romanians).

== Loss of elite status and unification with the Kingdom of Romania ==

Emperor Joseph II attempted to revoke the Unio Trium Nationum in the late 18th century. His actions were aimed at the political inequality within Transylvania, especially the political strength of the Saxons. Although his actions were ultimately rescinded, many Saxons began to see themselves as being a small minority opposed by nationalist Romanians and Hungarians. Although they remained a rich and influential group, the Saxons were no longer a dominant class within Modern Age Transylvania.

The Hungarians, on the other hand, supported complete unification of Transylvania with the rest of Hungary. Stephan Ludwig Roth, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor and intellectual who led the German support for Romanian political rights, eventually opposed the unification of Transylvania with Hungary and was executed by the Hungarian military tribunal during the revolution.

Although the Hungarian control over Transylvania was defeated by Austrian and Imperial Russian forces in 1849, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 () between Austria and Hungary in 1867 did not represent a positive transformation for the political rights of the Transylvanian Saxons. After the end of World War I, on 8 January 1919, the representatives of the Transylvanian Saxons decided to support the unification of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania, as did other German groups in the newly enlarged state (e.g. Bessarabia Germans or Bukovina Germans).

They were promised full minority rights, but many wealthy Saxons lost part of their land in the land reform process that was implemented in the whole of Romania after World War I. Subsequently, taking into account the rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, many Transylvanian Saxons became staunch supporters of national socialism, with the Evangelical Lutheran Church losing, eventually, very much of its influence in the community as time passed by, shortly before and during the outbreak of World War II.

== World War II and contemporary history ==

In February 1942 and May 1943, Germany concluded agreements with Hungary and Romania respectively, following which the Germans who were fit for military service, although they were either Hungarian citizens (in northern Transylvania, entered the composition of the Hungarian state through the Second Vienna Award) or Romanian citizens (in southern Transylvania, remaining part of Romania), could be incorporated into the regular German military units, into the Waffen-SS and into war-producing enterprises or into the Organisation Todt.

As a result of these agreements, approximately 95% of the members of the German ethnic group who were fit for military service (Transylvanian Saxons and Banat Swabians) voluntarily enrolled into the Waffen-SS units (approximately 63,000 people), with several thousand serving in the special units of the SS Security Service (SD-Sonderkommandos), of which at least 2,000 ethnic Germans were enrolled in the concentration camps (KZ-Wachkompanien), of which at least 55% served in extermination camps, predominantly in Auschwitz and Lublin. About 15% of the Romanian ethnic Germans who served in the Waffen-SS died in the war, with only a few thousand survivors returning to Romania.

When Romania signed a peace treaty with the Soviets in 1944, the German military began withdrawing the Saxons from Transylvania; this operation was most thorough with the Saxons of the Nösnerland (Bistrița area). Around 100,000 Germans fled before the Soviet Red Army, but Romania did not conduct the expulsion of Germans as did neighboring countries at war&#x27;s end. However, more than 70,000 Germans from Romania were arrested by the Soviet Army and sent to labour camps in contemporary Ukraine (more specifically in Donbas) for alleged cooperation with Nazi Germany.

In 1989, there were still 95,000 Saxons living in Romania (approx. 40% of the population of 1910), and between 1991 and 1992 another 75,000 emigrated. Their number shrank to 14,770 according to the data provided by the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Romania in 2003.

Because they are considered &quot;Auslandsdeutsche&quot; (&quot;Germans from abroad&quot;) by the German government, the Saxons have the right to German citizenship under the law of return. Numerous Saxons have emigrated to Germany, especially after the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989 and are represented by the Association of Transylvanian Saxons in Germany.

Because of this constant emigration from Romania, the population of Saxons has been gradually dwindling. At the same time, especially after Romania&#x27;s accession to NATO and the EU, many Transylvanian Saxons are returning from Germany, reclaiming property lost to the former communist regime and/or starting up small and medium-sized enterprises. The Saxons remaining in Romania are represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania (FDGR/DFDR), the political platform that gave Romania its fifth president, Klaus Iohannis, who was firstly elected in 2014 and then re-elected by a landslide in 2019.

== Culture ==

Before their expulsion from communist Romania by communist and securist Romanian authorities, the Transylvanian Saxons formed distinct communities in their towns and villages, where they maintained their ethnic tradition characterised by specific customs, folklore, way of life, and distinctive clothing style (i.e. national costumes or &quot;Sächsische Trachten&quot;). For example, one of the traditions held was the &quot;Neighborhood&quot; &quot;()&quot; in which many households formed a small supporting community. This, according to some scholars, is of ancient German origin.

=== Cuisine ===



The traditional cuisine of the Transylvanian Saxons is very similar to that of the Romanians and the Hungarians living in Transylvania as well as to those of the Germans, Austrians, or Alemannic Swiss (i.e. from German-speaking Switzerland). In these regards, the Transylvanian Saxon cuisine can be regarded as quintessentially Central European. It also shares some identical dishes with the Austrian cuisine such as cremeschnitte (which has also been traditionally served in Bukovina as well).

One prominent example of a local traditional dessert of the Transylvanian Saxons is the &quot;hanklich&quot; (), a sweet cheese pie with powdered sugar on top (variations include plums as main ingredients, raisins, or other dry fruits). This particular pastry is still served in restaurants and bakeries in southern Transylvania, particularly in Brașov and Sibiu counties, where, historically, there had been a more significant Transylvanian Saxon ethnic presence compared to the other counties across Transylvania. In Romanian, it is also known as &quot;lichiu săsesc&quot; or just &quot;lichiu&quot;.

Another notable example of a traditional Transylvanian Saxon dish is &quot;kipferl&quot; () which can be filled with vanilla, many types of fruit jams, but also with meat. Another traditional Transylvanian Saxon dish is &quot;palukes&quot;. &quot;Kartoffelknodel&quot; is yet another noteworthy traditional Transylvanian Saxon delight.

Other traditional Transylvanian Saxon dishes include:

* Apple soup ();
* Brodelawend (beef soup);
* Strudel;
* Apple pie;
* Lebkuchen (i.e. gingerbread);
* Pancakes (Palatschinke style) with cheese (more specifically curd).

=== Dialect ===

The Transylvanian Saxon dialect (endonym: &quot;Siweberjesch-Såksesch&quot; or simply just &quot;Såksesch&quot;; ) is a very conservative and rather archaic German dialect that has evolved throughout the passing of time relatively isolated from other German dialects (apart, most notably, from Transylvanian Landler). It has also come in contact with Romanian and Hungarian from which several words were derived. Nevertheless, Transylvanian Saxon is very similar to Luxembourgish and sounds as a form of medieval German (e.g. Old High German or Middle High German). 

The similarities with Luxembourgish are both in lexical nature and grammar nature. It also has a series of characters which are different from those of standard German (i.e., &quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;), for example &#x27;å&#x27; (or &quot;dumpfes a&quot; as it is known in standard German) which is pronounced as in Norwegian or Danish. It is also important to note the fact that even proper names of some Transylvanian Saxon localities sound very similar to Luxembourgish (e.g., &quot;Neithausen&quot; or &quot;New house&quot; as it can be understood in Luxembourgish if divided into two words). The earliest text in Transylvanian Saxon was written by Johannes Tröster in 1666.

In comparative linguistics, Transylvanian Saxon is a West Central German dialect which is part of the Moselle Franconian branch. Historically, it has been spoken more in rural areas of Transylvania and to a lesser extent in the urban settlements where Transylvanian Saxons lived. Transylvanian Saxon as a regional dialect varied geographically and, consequently, that each village had its own form of it while still retaining mutual intelligibility among themselves as well.

=== Literature ===

The Transylvanian Saxon literature represents a part of the German literature in Central and Eastern Europe as well as a part of Romanian literature. It has been written by Transylvanian Saxon writers since the Middle Ages onwards, in Latin, the Transylvanian Saxon dialect, and Standard German. Writers of partial German/Transylvanian Saxon descent from Transylvania such as Nicolae Breban have also been writing in Romanian. The Transylvanian Saxon literature consists of both prose and poems, ranging from folk tales, folk ballads, and ecclesiastical texts such as prayers. Notable Transylvanian Saxon writers include Josef/Joseph Haltrich and Dutz Schuster (also known as Gustav Schuster-Dutz; full name at birth: Gustav Michael Julius Schuster).

=== Anthem ===

&quot;Das Siebenbürgenlied&quot; (i.e. &quot;The song of Transylvania&quot;) is the regional anthem of the Transylvanian Saxon community as well as an unofficial regional hymn of Transylvania, praising the region as a land of blessings and great natural beauty. It was written and composed in the mid 19th century. The lyricist was Maximilian Leopold Moltke and the composer was Transylvanian Saxon Johann Lukas Hedwig from Hălchiu (). The anthem is also known as &quot;Siebenbürgen, Land des Segens&quot; (literally &quot;Transylvania, land of blessings&quot;).

== Famous Transylvanian Saxons ==

Famous Transylvanian Saxons include intellectuals Johannes Honterus, Christian Schesaeus, Johannes Sommer, Samuel von Brukenthal, Georg Maurer, Johann Böhm, or Stephan Ludwig Roth, composers such as Georg Meyndt and Carl Filtsch, visual artists such as Fritz Schullerus, Edith Soterius von Sachsenheim, or Friedrich Miess, scientists such as Hermann Oberth and Conrad Haas, or sportsmen such as Michael Klein, Mora Windt-Martini, or Otto Tellmann. Well known Transylvanian Saxon politicians and administrative leaders include Michael Weiß (former mayor of Brașov/Kronstadt), Klaus Johannis (current President of Romania and former mayor of Sibiu/Hermannstadt), Iancu Sasul (i.e. John the Saxon), Johannes Benkner (a former mayor of Brașov/Kronstadt), or Astrid Fodor (current mayor of Sibu/Hermannstadt).

<doc id="1212188" wikidata="Q151975" url="?curid=1212188" title="Ted Williams Tunnel">
<text>The Ted Williams Tunnel is a highway tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts. The third in the city to travel under Boston Harbor, with the Sumner Tunnel and the Callahan Tunnel, it carries the final segment of Interstate 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) from South Boston towards its eastern terminus at Route 1A in East Boston, slightly beyond Logan International Airport. The tunnel is named after the Boston Red Sox baseball legend Ted Williams.

The underwater section of the tunnel is 90 feet below the surface of Boston Harbor, the deepest such connection in North America.
==History==
The Ted Williams Tunnel (TWT) was the first major link constructed as part of Boston&#x27;s Big Dig. It is constructed from twelve &quot;binocular&quot; shaped steel sections fabricated in a Baltimore shipyard. These sections were then brought to the Black Falcon Pier near the site and each was fitted with a large surrounding mass of concrete (so that the tunnel section was more neutrally buoyant). Using additional flotation, the tunnel sections were then floated into place, lowered into a dredged channel, and joined to the other sections. At this point, the steel panels sealing the now-joined sections could be cut out and the finishing operations could be completed.

When the TWT opened in 1995 it was only available to authorized commercial traffic. Later, non-commercial traffic was allowed to access the tunnel on weekends and holidays. In 2003, with the substantial completion of the I-90 portion of the Big Dig, the tunnel was opened to all traffic at all times.

The tunnel is long, of which approximately are underwater. A toll is collected in both directions, through the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system, formerly named the &quot;Fast Lane&quot; system. Vehicles with a Massachusetts E-ZPass transponder pay $1.75, and the tolls are higher for vehicles with an out of state E-ZPass or vehicles without an E-ZPass. Eligible East Boston residents for the E-ZPass discount program pay $0.20 for either direction. Commercial vehicles pay higher, depending on number of axles.
==Big Dig ceiling collapse==


On July 10, 2006, at approximately 11 p.m. four three-ton sections of a concrete drop ceiling inside the I-90 Fort Point Channel tunnel leading to the Ted Williams Tunnel collapsed. A section of ceiling fell on top of a car traveling through the connector tunnel, killing 38-year-old passenger Milena Del Valle and slightly injuring her husband Angel Del Valle, who was driving. The cause of the collapse was later determined to be the failure of adhesives connecting a steel tieback suspending the concrete drop ceiling to the main ceiling above. Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney ordered the eastbound lanes of the Ted Williams Tunnel to be immediately shut down on July 20 after two ceiling supports showed signs of slippage. At a press conference, Romney stated that &quot;pull tests&quot; were to be conducted in the eastbound tube to test the stress load on the bolt/epoxy system that supports the drop ceiling. An independent contracting firm was to conduct that test. Romney said the shutdown should last &quot;hours, not days&quot;. The next morning, the eastbound lanes of the tunnel were opened to MBTA Silver Line buses as well as commercial buses running to Logan Airport.

Late in the evening of August 8, I-90 connector ramp A leading to the Ted Williams Tunnel was reopened to general traffic, easing the crunch on Logan Airport traffic coming from the south. Cars heading to the airport northbound on the Southeast Expressway (I-93) would get off at exit 15B (former exit 18) and take the South Boston Access (Haul) Road to Ramp A, eliminating the need to go through downtown Boston and U-turn at Storrow Drive to access the Callahan Tunnel. One eastbound lane of the connector tunnel which collapsed was reopened to traffic on September 1.

<text>The Ford C-Max (stylized as Ford C-MAX and previously called the Ford Focus C-Max) is a car produced by the Ford Motor Company from 2003 to 2019. It has a five-door compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) design. The Ford Grand C-Max has a longer wheelbase.

Ford introduced the C-Max in the United States as its first hybrid-only line of vehicles, which includes the C-Max Hybrid, released in September 2012, and the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid, launched in October 2012. Although the C-Max was initially available only in Europe, the first generation was partially available in New Zealand. 

== First generation (2003) ==
The Ford Focus C-Max is preceded by the eponymous show car, which was designed by Daniel Paulin and unveiled at the 2002 Paris Motor Show.

C-Max Mk I was the first product to use the Ford C1 platform, also used by the Ford Focus Mk II and the compact MPV Premacy/Mazda5. Its internal code name is C214.

It seats five passengers and has a large amount of cargo space, which can be increased by folding the rear seats flat. Some models feature diagonally sliding outer rear seats. It also shares the control blade independent rear suspension from the Focus.

===Engines and transmissions===
The available four-cylinder engines are the same as the Focus.
The 1.6 L Duratec was the basic engine for C-Max, and the 1.6 L Ti-VCT Duratec was also available.
The 1.8/2.0 L Duratec HE engines are the rest of available petrol engines.
The 1.8 L Ford flexifuel, or 1.8f, was a flexible-fuel hybrid engine sourced from Volvo, B4204S5, and was able to run on gasoline and ethanol (E85). Ethanol added about 25 hp extra for a total 125 hp, although with higher consumption.

The 1.6/2.0 L Duratorq Ford/PSA-made diesels were available along with Ford&#x27;s 1.8 L Endura engine, which is upgraded and named Duratorq.

*Overboost

Transmissions mated with engines are Ford IB5 (1.6/1.8 Duratec), Ford Durashift (2.0 Duratorq), MTX-75 (2.0 Duratec / 1.6-1.8 Duratorq) manual and Ford Powershift double-clutch transmission available with 2.0 Duratorq. The 4F27E mated with the 2.0 Duratec engine. A CVT automatic was also available

===Facelift===
In December 2006, the facelifted version of the C-Max was revealed at the 2006 Bologna Motor Show and went on sale in late spring 2007. The pre-facelift version of the car (2003–2007) was called the Ford Focus C-Max. The name change to C-Max is attributable to Ford&#x27;s MPV strategy of creating a &#x27;Max&#x27; branded line of MPVs, starting with the Ford S-Max, launched in 2006.

The facelift brought the car in line with Ford&#x27;s &quot;Kinetic Design&quot; design language, evidenced through its twin trapezoidal grilles, large wheel arches, and angular headlights. As the car does not have a bodyshell originally designed for Kinetic Design, though, Ford officially states that the car contains only &quot;elements&quot; of the design language.

==Second generation (2011)==
Alongside the third-generation Ford Focus Mk III, the second-generation C-Max (C344) is built on Ford&#x27;s new Global C platform. The appearance is inspired by the Iosis Max concept, shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. In addition, Ford added a long-wheelbase, seven-seat minivan variant of the C-Max, the Ford Grand C-Max.

The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. Early European models include 5 seats, and 7-seat models entered the market at the end of 2010 (except Russia, where there is only the 7-seat model). At the 2011 North American International Auto Show, Ford announced a seven-seat C-MAX for the North American market, but this model was cancelled prior to launch.

Ford unveiled the Ford C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid and the C-Max Hybrid at the 2011 North American International Auto Show. Like the conventional C-Max, the C-Max Energi and Hybrid are five-seat only. They replace the Ford Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner Hybrid since Ford discontinued the Mercury brand after the 2011 model year and the Escape Hybrid after the 2012 year model. The C-Max is Ford&#x27;s first hybrid-only line of vehicles. Both the plug-in and hybrid versions are based on the European gasoline- and diesel-powered versions.

The C-Max Hybrid was released in the United States in September 2012 as a 2013 model, followed by the release of the plug-in Energi version by mid-October 2012.

Production of the C-Max Energi in the United States ended in September 2017, while Hybrid production ended in 2018.

===Features===
The new Mk III platform is the first in its class to support torque vectoring control.

The redesigned C-Max features flat folding third-row seats, a hands-free power lift gate, rear-view camera, park assist, and panoramic sunroof. HD radio, Sirius XM, Sync, dual-zone climate control system, and a navigation system come as standard or as available options on the different trim lines.

The aerodynamics (drag coefficient, &quot;cw&quot;) of the car has been improved, being 0,30 for the five-seater and 0,32 for the Grand C-Max.

===Conventional engines and transmissions===
Like the previous C-Max, the new C-Max also came with a range of petrol and diesel four-cylinder engines, which were shared with the Focus:
*The 1.0 L Ecoboost comes available in two states of tune, alongside the 1.6 - guises.
*The 1.6 L naturally aspirated Duratec Ti-VCT was available in three output levels.
*The 1.6 L EcoBoost came in two different variants, the same as in the Focus.
*The 1.5 L EcoBoost replaced the earlier 1.6 in April 2015; its power and torque figures are identical to the 1.6.
*The 1.6 L eight-valve Duratorq TDCi Ford/PSA-made diesels were upgraded; Ford&#x27;s 1.8 L Endura engine was no longer available.
*The 1.5 L 16-valve Duratorq TDCi replaced the earlier 1.6 in April 2015.
*The 2.0 16-valve Duratorq TDCi Ford/PSA-made diesels came in three different output levels; as of April 2015, this engine was overhauled and then only two versions were available.

Transmissions mated with the engines are the Ford IB5 (1.6 Duratec Ti-VCT), B6 (1.6 EcoBoost/1.6 Duratorq), Durashift MMT6 (2.0 Duratorq) manual, and Ford Powershift double-clutch transmission available with the 2.0 Duratorq engine.

The Ford C-MAX was facelifted in 2015 and the 1.6 Ecoboost changed to the three-cylinder 1.0 Ecoboost along with the 1.6 TDCI 115PS Duratorq changing to the 1.5 TDCI single-overhead-cam unit.

=== Hybrid ===
Ford developed the C-Max Hybrid with the aim to become &quot;America’s most affordable hybrid utility vehicle.&quot; The gasoline-electric hybrid model base pricing started at , including destination and delivery.

==== Specifications ====

The front-wheel drive hybrid has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder Atkinson cycle engine mated to an electric motor and a 1.4 kWh lithium-ion battery for total power output of . The top speed in all-electric mode of and the car&#x27;s top speed in hybrid mode is .

The hybrid has a maximum cargo volume of with rear seats folded flat, and in the cargo area behind the rear seats, providing more room than the regular Prius liftback, but less cargo room than the Prius V, which provides with the rear seats folded.

The Hybrid is offered in two trims:

The SE features eco-friendly cloth seating surfaces, Ford SYNC system with A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player, USB and auxiliary input jacks, six speakers, a multi-informational gauge cluster and color display screen, keyless entry, alloy wheels, and split-folding rear bench seat, plus a security alarm.

The SEL adds leather seating surfaces, MyFord Touch with AM/FM HD radio stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and USB and auxiliary input jacks, a Sony premium surround sound system, SIRIUS Satellite Radio, power dual front seats, keyless access, push-button start system, and other luxury features. For the 2017 model year, the SEL trim level on both the C-Max Hybrid and Energi were renamed to the Titanium trim level and also all the 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrids and plug-in Energis were expected to have restyled headlights and taillights.

The Energi Plug-In Hybrid was only available in SEL trim, but for the 2017 model year, the C-Max Energi was also available on the SE trim level.

==== EPA ratings ====
Ford&#x27;s design aimed for the C-Max Hybrid to deliver better fuel economy than the Toyota Prius V. Ford had reduced its estimated fuel economy twice, once in 2013 and again in 2014, with the second revision placing fuel economy below the Prius V. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially rated the hybrid model at with the same rating for combined/city/highway cycles. These ratings allowed the C-Max Hybrid to improve the fuel economy of the Toyota Prius v by on the city cycle, by on the highway cycle and by combined. However, after criticism and lawsuits about worse-than-expected real-world fuel economy, in August 2013 Ford voluntarily lowered the EPA ratings and issued customer rebates. The revised fuel economy ratings were reduced to for city driving, for combined and for highway. The revised rating for the updated 2013 C-Max Hybrid is still better than the combined rating for the Toyota Prius v. A second downward revision was made during June 2014.

Ford boosted the on-road fuel efficiency of its three 2013 model year hybrids through changes in the cars&#x27; vehicle control software in an effort to improve customer satisfaction. The upgrade was offered free of charge to existing owners of these hybrids. Some of the changes include: 
* Increasing the maximum pure electric speed from , allowing increased use of electric-only mode on the highway
* Optimizing the use of active grille shutters to reduce aerodynamic drag under more driving and temperature conditions, including cold weather, during air conditioner use, and when the engine coolant temperature is higher
* Reducing the electric fan speed as a function of coolant temperature to minimize the fan’s energy consumption
* Shortening engine warm-up time by up to 50% to enable electric-only driving and engine shutdown at stops sooner after cold starts
* Optimizing the climate-control system to minimize use of the air-conditioning compressor and reduce the energy used in cold-weather operation

==== Sales ====
A total of 969 units was sold during September 2012, allowing the C-Max Hybrid to rank as the ninth-best selling hybrid car in the United States that month. During October, its first full month in the market, 3,182 units were sold, outselling the Prius V by more than 400 units, which had ranked as the fourth-most sold hybrid in the previous months. Sales of the C-Max Hybrid also led Ford to achieve its best October hybrid sales month ever with a total of 4,612 sales, up 142% over October 2011. Ford reported that 25% of C-Max Hybrid sales took place in California, with Los Angeles and San Francisco as the top-selling regional markets. A total of 10,935 C-Max Hybrids were sold during 2012, and a total of 28,056 units in 2013. After Ford cut the car&#x27;s EPA fuel economy rating by to in the middle of 2012, the car experienced its three worst sales months since it debuted in the U.S. Since its inception, a total of 72,330 units had been sold in the United States through December 2015.

====Fuel economy controversies====
In December 2012, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; reported that &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; magazine and Green Car Reports have found that the 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid and 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid, which share the same powertrain, do not deliver their triple EPA ratings in real-world use. After running both vehicles through Consumer Reports real-world tests, the magazine found that C-Max hybrid achieved a combined fuel economy average of , with and for city and highway. Green Car Reports found that the C-Max delivered over of mixed freeway and urban driving, and over mostly at freeway speeds.

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; concluded that the overall fuel economy for the C-Max Hybrid is off by , representing a deviation of about 20%. The consumer magazine said that their overall fuel economy results are usually close to the EPA&#x27;s combined-mpg estimate, and among current models tested, more than 80% fall within margin. The largest discrepancy the magazine has previously found was for the Toyota Prius C and the Prius hatchback, respectively. Ford responded in a statement, saying, &quot;Early C-MAX Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid customers praise the vehicles and report a range of fuel economy figures, including some reports above . This reinforces the fact that driving styles, driving conditions, and other factors can cause mileage to vary.&quot;

A few days later, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it would review claims that two new Ford hybrid vehicles were not delivering the advertised 47 mpg. Linc Wehrly, Director of Light-duty Vehicle Center Compliance Division at EPA&#x27;s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, commented that hybrids had far more variability in miles per gallon than conventional vehicles. All vehicles are run through the same EPA fuel-efficiency tests, but they are not administered by the EPA; instead, the automakers conduct the test and EPA often conducts reviews. Most vehicles&#x27; real-world gas mileage levels are less than the EPA sticker number, and can often be 20% less. depending on speed, temperature, and other factors. The EPA explained that with hybrids, the gap was much wider, as high as 30%.

The problem lay with EPA&#x27;s rules that allowed automakers to group similar vehicles and apply the same ratings, which Ford did with the Fusion hybrid and C-Max hybrids.

Ford Motor Co. officials said the real-world fuel efficiency in the C-Max Hybrid depended on driving style and other factors, and that the company did not expect the car&#x27;s fuel efficiency numbers to change, as they followed EPA&#x27;s test guidelines. Ford said they were working closely with the EPA to determine if their hybrid vehicle testing procedures needed to be changed. They explained that several factors could affect hybrid fuel economy more than that of regular gasoline engines, including speed (as the difference between could produce a 7 mpg difference in fuel economy); outside temperature (the difference between could result in a 5 mpg difference); and vehicle break-in (a 5 mpg difference could occur from the difference ).

Due to the criticism and lawsuits, in July 2013, Ford announced it would boost the on-road fuel efficiency of the C-Max and its other two 2013 hybrids through changes in the vehicle control software, in an effort to improve customer satisfaction. The carmaker voluntarily reduced the official EPA ratings in August 2013. It also announced it would issue rebates to some 32,000 C-Max owners, who would be notified by mail. The payment would be to U.S. customers who purchased C-Maxes, and to customers who had leased them.

After the Ford announcement, the EPA stated that it would update the test procedures used to assign fuel economy ratings to cars &quot;to ensure that the requirements keep pace with industry trends and innovations in advanced high-efficiency vehicles.&quot; Ford used the Fusion Hybrid test to generate the fuel economy label for the C-Max Hybrid following EPA&#x27;s rules. These, which date to the 1970s, specify that automakers can use the same fuel economy numbers for similar-sized vehicles equipped with the same engines and transmissions. The EPA requires automakers to test the fuel economy of the biggest-selling model in a specific category. In its midsized hybrid class, Ford tested the Fusion sedan version because it was the top seller, and Ford was allowed to apply the achieved with the Fusion Hybrid in combined, city, and highway driving to the C-Max hybrid. Ford had no plans to change the fuel economy ratings on the 2013 Fusion hybrid. 

In June 2014, Ford found some glitches in their internal tests and had to drop the MPG ratings by 1-2 miles per gallon for a few models like the 2013-2014 Fusion and C-Max hybrids, including the plug-ins. To mitigate customers&#x27; concerns, the automaker provided financial compensation. Depending on whether the vehicle was bought or leased, owners got from $150 to $1,050 to help cover the increase in fuel costs due to the new ratings.

=== Plug-in hybrid ===

The C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid started at including the destination fee. According to its battery size, the plug-in car qualified for a federal tax credit of , and it is eligible for additional incentives at the state and local level, such as California&#x27;s rebate.

==== Specifications ====
The C-Max Energi was designed with total in hybrid mode delivered by a 2.0-liter Atkinson cycle four-cylinder gasoline engine plus an electric motor powered by a 7.6 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, which is smaller and lighter than nickel–metal hydride batteries used in previous Ford generation hybrids. The electric drivetrain can produce a peak power of , limited by the size of the electric motor and the power-delivery capability of the battery pack, and delivered a total system power of in charge-depleting mode (EV mode). The C-Max Energi is capable of reaching a top electric-only speed of , exceeding the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid (Prius Prime in North America) by more than . The top speed in hybrid mode is .

The C-Max Energi uses a regenerative braking system capable of capturing and reusing more than 95% of the braking energy normally lost during the braking process. The charging time for the C-Max Energi is 7 hours with a 120-volt charger, and 2.5 hours with a 240-volt charger. The charge port has an LED light ring like the Ford Focus Electric and is located on the driver’s side and near the front of the car. The light ring illuminates to indicate charge status. The battery is covered by an 8-year or component warranty.

Ford equipped the C-Max Energi with a button mounted in the center stack that enables drivers to choose an electric-only driving mode, and allows the driver to switch vehicle operation between three modes - electric-only driving without gasoline engine power (&quot;EV Now&quot; setting); normal hybrid mode where the powertrain blends electric and gasoline engine power as appropriate (&quot;EV Auto&quot; setting); or a battery-saving mode that reserves the battery power for later use (&quot;EV Later&quot; setting). Like the Ford Fusion Hybrid, the C-Max Energi comes with a SmartGauge with EcoGuide that provides in-vehicle customizable displays, including instantaneous fuel economy readings and coaching functions to help drivers understand and optimize their fuel efficiency. The plug-in hybrid also features ECO Cruise which saves energy by relaxing acceleration compared to standard cruise control.

==== EPA ratings ====
Ford designed the C-Max Energi plug-in hybrid to deliver better miles per gallon equivalent (MPG-e) in all-electric mode than the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid. Initially, the EPA rated the Energi combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode at 100 MPG-e (). Later, when owners complained of not achieving the sticker fuel economy, and following a technical review, the official EPA rating in EV mode was downgraded to 88 MPG-e (). In a similar way, initially the EPA rating in hybrid-gasoline mode was , but it was later downgraded to . EPA&#x27;s rating for combined EV/hybrid operation is 51 MPG-e (4.6 L gasoline equivalent/100 km), which allows the C-Max Energi to rank in sixth place, together with the Fusion Energi, among the top ten EPA-Rated Fuel Sippers since 1984.

The C-Max Energi has an all-electric range of , for a total EPA certified range of , which in 2012 surpassed both the first-generation Chevrolet Volt (), and the Prius Plug-in Hybrid ().

==== Sales ====
Ford released the C-Max Energi in the U.S. market by mid October 2012, and during that month 144 units were delivered to U.S. retail customers, and ended with 2,374 units delivered in 2012. The C-Max Energi ranked as the fifth top selling plug-in electric car in the U.S. during 2013, and climbed to number fourth in 2014. Over 35,700 units have been sold in North America and Europe through December 2016, with 33,509 units delivered in the U.S. through December 2016, 967 units in Canada through December 2016, and 1,229 in the Netherlands in 2015.

=== C-Max Solar Energi concept ===
Ford Motor Company announced the C-MAX Solar Energi concept, a solar PV-powered vehicle to run electrically without depending on the electric grid for fuel. The C-MAX Solar Energi Concept was unveiled at the 2014 International CES in Las Vegas. This is a collaborative project of Ford, SunPower Corp. and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

=== Production ===
For the North American market, the C-Max Hybrid was assembled alongside the 2012 Focus and Ford Focus Electric at Ford&#x27;s Wayne plant in Michigan. The C-Max Energi was also assembled in Michigan. Since 2015, all European versions are built in the Saarlouis Body &amp; Assembly, Germany. Ford of Europe announced that it would end production of both the C-Max and Grand C-Max in Germany by the end of the second quarter of 2019.

==Recognition==
*The C-Max Energi was awarded the 2012 Green Car Vision Award by the Green Car Journal at the 2012 Washington Auto Show.
*Both the Ford C-Max hybrid and the Energi plug-in hybrid were among the five finalists for the 2013 Green Car of the Year awarded by the Green Car Journal at the 2012 Los Angeles Auto Show.
In Europe, the C-Max is designed with lower VOC and allergens, along with several other Ford vehicles.

<doc id="1212198" wikidata="Q1967491" url="?curid=1212198" title="Kangaroo paw">
<text>Kangaroo paw is the common name for a number of species, in two genera of the family Haemodoraceae, that are native to the south-west of Western Australia. These rhizomatous perennial plants are noted for their unique bird-attracting flowers. The tubular flowers are coated with dense hairs and open at the apex with six claw-like structures which resemble kangaroo forelimbs, and it is from this paw-like formation that the common name &quot;kangaroo paw&quot; is derived.

The kangaroo paw plant has been introduced into Japan and has been grown as a new ornamental crop mainly in Okinawa Island under a subtropical climate.

== History ==
The genus Anigozanthos&#x27; author was French botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardière, who first collected the kangaroo paw in 1792 near Esperance. Red and green kangaroo paw or Kurulbrang (Noongar) was introduced to England in 1833, and was first described in 1836 by botanist David Don. The specific name &quot;manglesii&quot; is so named in honour of the first individual to raise the specimen from seed, Robert Mangles, which he did in his English garden. His experience with growing the specimen is recorded in letters to his brother James Mangles.

The red and green kangaroo paw was adopted as the state emblem of Western Australia in a proclamation on 9 October 1960. An image of a red and green kangaroo paw was superimposed onto a view of Perth from a distance on a 5 pence stamp, issued 1 November 1962, commemorating the Seventh British Empire and Commonwealth Games which were held in Perth that year. The stamp was designed by R. M. Warner. The red and green kangaroo paw was again included on a stamp on 10 July 1968, which were six cent stamps in a series of state floral emblems. It was designed by Nell Wilson.

In 1990, disease was found on the kangaroo paw plant in Okinawa. The unreported fungi, which caused the plant to become very limp and wilt, was characterised by a discolouration of the plant leaving it a brown to black colour around the stalks, leaves and base of the plant. As the plant began to discolour over time, white cottony mycelia started to appear at the surface of the lesions and then the plant eventually died.

== Cultivation and cut flowers ==
The plant is native to south-western Australia, occurring naturally from the Murchison River in the North to Busselton and Mount Barker in the South, and Lake Muir to the East. It has been developed as a cut-flower crop in the United States, Israel and Japan. In Israel, plants are propagated from tissue culture imported from Australia and are then grown in unheated greenhouses in natural day conditions. The plants have found their way to California and become popular among garden supply businesses there.

=== Research ===
In 2007 Kings Park Botanic and Garden Board started a breeding program to protect the Kangaroo Paw from disease and the impact of climate changes. During this effort cross breading between 5 different species brought about new colouring including blue shades. The breeding program is working with Edith Cowan University to map the genome sequences, look to find disease and drought resistant triggers for the plant.

Research leading up to 2020 has been able to produce many new colours for the kangaroo paw including blues, purples, whites, and many more. This has led to genetic research and DNA sequencing similar to that carried out on Snapdragons to understanding the colours of the flower. Other research has been conducted that indicates an extract of the plant may help firm the skin as it targets young cells causing increased collagen output.

<text>Bagatelle sans tonalité (&quot;Bagatelle without tonality&quot;, S.216a) is a piece for solo piano written by Franz Liszt in 1885. The manuscript bears the title &quot;Fourth Mephisto Waltz&quot; and may have been intended to replace the piece now known as the Fourth Mephisto Waltz when it appeared Liszt would not be able to finish it; the phrase &quot;Bagatelle ohne Tonart&quot; actually appears as a subtitle on the front page of the manuscript.

The Bagatelle is a waltz in a typical sectioned dance form, with repeated sections given inventive variation. While this piece is not especially dissonant, it is extremely chromatic, becoming what Liszt&#x27;s contemporary François-Joseph Fétis called &quot;omnitonic&quot; in that it lacks any definite feeling for a tonal center. Some critics have suggested, however, that the various underpinnings of the piece—in other words, the main bass notes and melodic elements—work together to imply an underlying tonality of D, which would link the Bagatelle in terms of tonality with the Fourth Mephisto Waltz.

==Overview==

===Program===
The Bagatelle, like the Mephisto Waltzes, could be considered a typical example of program music, taking for its program an episode from &quot;Faust&quot;, not by Goethe but by Nikolaus Lenau (1802–1850). The following program note, which Liszt took from Lenau, appears in the printed score of the &quot;Mephisto Waltz No. 1&quot;:

There is a wedding feast in progress in the village inn, with music, dancing, carousing. Mephistopheles and Faust pass by, and Mephistopheles induces Faust to enter and take part in the festivities. Mephistopheles snatches the fiddle from the hands of a lethargic fiddler and draws from it indescribably seductive and intoxicating strains. The amorous Faust whirls about with a full-blooded village beauty in a wild dance; they waltz in mad abandon out of the room, into the open, away into the woods. The sounds of the fiddle grow softer and softer, and the nightingale warbles his love-laden song.&quot;

===Form===
Written in waltz form, the Bagatelle remains one of Liszt&#x27;s most adventurous experiments in pushing beyond the bounds of tonality, concluding with an upward rush of diminished sevenths. Some have analyzed the piece as being constructed around a symmetrical chord—the G diminished chord with which the work ends—with the B–F tritone symbolizing Mephistopheles as part of this chord. The lack of a definite key feeling, these critics continue, is due to the piece&#x27;s reliance on mainly tritone and diminished seventh harmony, as well as the piece&#x27;s ending in an indefinite manner.

The main theme, marked &quot;Scherzando&quot;, alternates between F and F, suggesting an oscillation traditional between major and minor modes. Consequently, the main elements of this melody, E and A, combine with C in the bass to project what would traditionally be considered the dominant here.

A contrasting &quot;appassionato&quot; section contains a bass line of C–D–E–E–F, that conforms with a standard tonal progression in D minor. Moreover, the motivic activity between this bass line and the melodic features of the introduction strengthens the significance of D as a tonal center, overriding sectional contrasts. The second half of this work is basically a repeat of the first half with glittering variations based for the most part on the harmonic underpinning. The fact the Fourth Mephisto Waltz is written in D major confirms to some critics that Liszt may have intended this work to replace it and that it was indeed written in 1885.

===Premiere and publication===
Unlike the Third and Fourth Mephisto Waltzes, the Bagatelle received its premiere within Liszt&#x27;s lifetime, by his pupil Hugo Mansfeldt in Weimar on June 10, 1885. Like the Fourth Mephisto Waltz, however, it was not published until 1955.

<text>Jürgen Erich Schrempp (born September 15, 1944, in Freiburg) was the CEO of Daimler-Benz from May 1995 to December 31, 2005, which became DaimlerChrysler, a German-American car and truck manufacturer. Following a decision of the board taken on July 28, 2005, he was succeeded on January 1, 2006, by Chrysler frontman Dieter Zetsche. Schrempp was the architect of the merger joint venture between Daimler Benz and Chrysler, which ultimately ended in failure when Chrysler was sold in 2007.

== Career ==
During his tenure, Daimler-Benz made the 80% acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation to become DaimlerChrysler. Schrempp called the merger a &quot;match made in heaven&quot;. In addition to the acquisition of Chrysler, Schrempp pursued the acquisition of Mitsubishi Motors as part of his &#x27;Three Pillars&#x27; strategy to expand the reach of Daimler-Benz into the major markets of the United States and Asia.

In 2004, the Mitsubishi investment became a liability with the Japanese manufacturer swamped under a mountain of debt and following a refusal by other members of the Japanese Mitsubishi &quot;keiretsu&quot; to assist Daimler in funding its operation. The German company eventually walked away with substantial losses. On 14 May 2007, Daimler sold 80% of Chrysler to the private equity firm Cerberus.

Before becoming the CEO of Daimler-Benz in 1995, Schrempp headed the aerospace division of Daimler-Benz, then called DASA, which is EADS today. DASA acquired the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker that was already in difficulty in 1993 after it signed a contract stating the intention to take Fokker over on October 30, 1992. Schrempp called Fokker his &quot;love baby&quot;. On January 22, 1996, after having subsidized the losses of Fokker with billions of Deutsche Marks, Daimler-Benz decided to stop putting more money into Fokker, and the firm subsequently went bankrupt.

Schrempp is a Director of South African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation Ltd., and Compagnie Financière Richemont S.A., Switzerland. Additional engagements include the Chairmanship of United Global Academy - UGA, the advisory board of Deutsche Bank, the European Advisory Board of Harvard Business School, and the German Council of INSEAD. He is also on the board of Transnet.

He was previously a non-executive director of Vodafone Group plc, after their 2000 take over of Mannesman Group. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

== Recognition ==
Schrempp is the recipient of:
* Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany
* Bavarian Order of Merit
* Medal of Merit of the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg
* Commander of the National Order of Merit of the French Republic
* Commander of the French Legion of Honour
* The Vatican City’s Cross of the St. Gregorius Order
* Austrian Grand Decoration of Honor in Gold with Star for Services
* Brazilian Southern Cross.
* Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship
* Commander of the Order of Good Hope

== Personal life ==

Schrempp lives primarily in Munich, Germany and Kitzbuehel Austria where his wife, Lydia Schrempp, owns an Italian restaurant. He has been married to Lydia since 2000, with whom he has a daughter, Loana Theresa, (born in 2001) and a son, Luca-Timon, (born in 2005). Schrempp has two sons, Alexander and Marc, from his previous marriage to Renate Lutz, which was ended by Lutz due to Schremp&#x27;s adulterous affair with Lydia, who was his secretary at the time.

<text>The Dalarna Regiment (), designation I 13, is a Swedish Army infantry unit that traced its origins back to the 16th century. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from the province of Dalarna, where it was later garrisoned. The unit was disbanded as a result of the disarmament policies set forward in the Defence Act of 2000. The regiment was re-raised as Dalarna Regiment (I 13) in 2021. The unit is based in Falun.

== History ==
The regiment has its origins in &quot;fänikor&quot; (companies) raised in Dalarna in 1542. During 1598, some of the units participated in the War against Sigismund and in 1605 one &quot;fänika&quot; from Dalarna fought at the Battle of Kircholm. In 1615, these units—along with &quot;fänikor&quot; from the nearby provinces of Uppland and Västmanland—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into &quot;Upplands storregemente&quot;, of which 1,400 of the total 3,000 soldiers were recruited in Dalarna. &quot;Upplands storregemente&quot; consisted of three field regiments, of which the &quot;Dalregementet&quot; was one. The Dalarna Regiment was also the first Swedish regiment to be allotted, which happened as early as in 1621. Parts of this grand regiment participated in the Polish–Swedish wars during the siege of Riga in 1621 and as garrison from 1626–1629. During this period, sometime between 1623 and 1628, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which the Dalarna Regiment was one. The regiment&#x27;s first commander was Axel Oxenstierna.

The regiment was shipped to Germany and arrived at Wolgast in June 1631 to participate in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Its first major battle was the Battle of Breitenfeld on 17 September that same year, where it stood in the first line. It also stood in the first line as part of the Swedish Brigade at the Battle of Lützen the next year, a battle which caused heavy casualties to the regiment. The regiment&#x27;s &quot;creator&quot;, Gustav II Adolf, was killed in a cavalry charge trying to ease the pressure on the Dalarna Regiment&#x27;s part of the front. The regiment returned to Sweden to replenish shortly after and remained at home until 1638, when one of the regiment&#x27;s two battalions was sent as garrison to Stettin. The Dalarna Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634. Carl Gustaf Wrangel was the commander from 1639 on. The second battalion was sent to Germany in 1642, and the whole regiment fought at the Battle of Leipzig that year, only to return to Sweden again the following year. They were present during the siege of Landskrona in 1644 during the short Torstenson War.

The Dalarna Regiment was shipped to Pomerania in 1655 following the outbreak of the Northern Wars. The regiment was part of the army that sieged and captured Marienburg in 1656, after which one of the battalions was sent to reinforce the garrison in Riga while the other participated in the attack on Copenhagen in 1659. In preparation for the Scanian War, one of the battalions was sent back to Germany in 1674, and was once again put under command of Carl Gustaf Wrangel, who led a thrust into Brandenburg, which ended in the Battle of Fehrbellin. The other battalion was used in Scania in the Battles of Halmstad, Lund and Landskrona in 1676–1677. A temporarily raised reserve regiment of eight companies was used against Norway in the Battle of Uddevalla.

When the Great Northern War started, the Dalarna Regiment was under the command of Magnus Stenbock and was used against Denmark but was soon sent to the Baltic region, taking part in the Battle of Narva in 1700 and the Crossing of Daugava in 1701. In 1702, the regiment received orders to join the main army at Warsaw. The regiment took part in the Battle of Kliszów, but was sent back to the Baltics for periods between 1702 and 1705. It then was subordinated to the main army that fought at Holovczyn, Malatitze and finally at the Battle of Poltava, where the regiment surrendered to the Russians. The regiment was reformed with new recruits in Sweden in 1710 and was sent to Pomerania and the Battle of Gadebusch in 1712. The Dalarna Regiment once again had to surrender, this time in 1713 after the Siege of Tönning. The regiment was reformed a second time, and took part in both the 1716 and 1718 attacks on Norway.

The next action of the regiment was in 1741 during the Hats&#x27; Russian War and the Battle of Villmanstrand, the last of the regiment&#x27;s major battles. In 1758 the regiment was shipped to Pomerania yet again, this time to participate in the Seven Years&#x27; War, but the Dalarna Regiment saw no major battles during that war. In Gustav III&#x27;s Russian War, the Dalarna Regiment was initially positioned along the southern Finnish coast but was later transferred to the inland, where several minor skirmishes took place during 1790. One of the battalions was involved in the First War against Napoleon, fighting minor battles against Norwegian troops which ended with the whole battalion being captured in early 1808. The final battle of the Dalarna Regiment was during the Campaign against Norway in 1814, in the Battle of Kjölbergs bro, one of the last battles Sweden fought before adopting a policy of neutrality.

The regiment was given the designation I 13 (13th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816. Dalregementet was garrisoned in Falun from 1908. In 1973, the regiment gained the new designation I 13/Fo 53 as a consequence of a merge with the local defence district Fo 53. The regiment was disbanded in 2000.

The regiment was re-established on 23 October 2021, a symbolically chosen day for historical reasons. On 23 October 1642, the First Battle of Leipzig was fought, where the original Dalarna Regiment formed a brigade together with a German regiment. Dalarna Regiment was inaugurated by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf to the tunes of the Royal Swedish Army Band. The Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces, General Micael Bydén, Chief of Army, Major General Karl Engelbrektson and the Minister of Defence Peter Hultqvist also attended the inauguration.

The old officers mess is today in its original place in the chancellery building and is run by the regiment&#x27;s companion association. The Dalarna Regiment Group is the heir to the heritage and traditions of the regiment and organizationally under the Life Guards (LG). The Dalarna Regiment Group took over the colour and traditions in connection with disbandment of the regiment and the brigade on 30 June 2000. From 1 July 2013, the traditions of the regiment will be continued by the Dalarna Battalion, included in the Dalarna Regiment Group (&quot;Dalregementsgruppen&quot;).

<text>Sinar Photography AG is a Swiss company based in Zürich manufacturing specialized high-resolution view cameras for studio, reproduction, landscape and architecture photography.

Sinar&#x27;s view-cameras allow both the lens and the film back or sensor back to move in rotation or linearly in any direction (up/down, left/right, front back linearly, and pitch yaw tilt rotations), thus allowing precise image alignment corrections. The cameras are thus often used in advertising, document reproduction, product and architectural photography, where correctly vertical image lines, fine focus accuracy, and extra details are wanted.

The name SINAR is explained by the company itself as &quot;Still, Industrial, Nature, Architectural and Reproduction photography&quot; in the English version of the April 2011 press release. Other versions of the names were also used, with the S for studio, Sache, or science. In the Indonesian language, translates into English as &quot;light ray&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===
The business recalls its roots to Swiss photographer who worked in Marseille from 1865 to 1878. In 1879 and 1892 Koch also established two family-owned photography studios in Schaffhausen. Koch worked as a portrait, landscape and alpine photographer and was considered one of the first Swiss champions of alpine photography. From 1894 until his death in 1897, Koch was also president of the Swiss Photographers Association.

His son Hans-Carl expanded the family-owned photography studios to add retail sales of photographic equipment, starting from 1911. 

===Sinar system===
In 1947, the grandson of Koch senior, Carl Hans, a graduate photographer and photographic salesman, took over the family business on the early death of his father Hans-Carl, and founded the following year the Sinar company. Dissatisfied with the limited or imprecise nature of existing wooden view cameras (e.g. the large Kodak 3 and similar, and the popular Graphlex Graphic Graphlok series) and the limitations of technical (e.g. Linhof Technika) and field cameras of the day, he developed a modular camera and received in 1947 a patent for his Sinar camera. His main aims were to produce a large format monorail camera system of high precision and simple operation, with readily interchangeable parts and accessories.

The Sinar system&#x27;s versatility is based on the interchangeability of parts as well as a large number of accessories that have been produced over the years. Major components (rails, bellows, lensboards, and standards) made in the 1940s are still usable with currently manufactured Sinar equipment.

In 1968 Carl Hans&#x27; son entered the family business and the company&#x27;s camera production moved to Feuerthalen (north of Zürich).

===Changing ownership===
Jenoptik acquired a majority stake (51%) of Sinar in 2005. Leica Camera announced it had purchased Jenoptik&#x27;s stake in 2006, but the sale was cancelled before the end of the year. When Jenoptik withdrew from the medium format camera market, Sinar was spun off in July 2009. Sinar moved its base of operations to Zürich in October 2009 after separating from Jenoptik.

On 26 November 2013 Leica Camera AG took over Sinar Photography AG.

==View cameras==

Sinar use a five digit coding system for each of the modular parts in many of their modern view cameras, broken up into two parts separated by a dot (.); the three digits preceding the dot designate the class of the component, while the two digits following the dot designate the specific model or revision of the component.

For example, the base monorail used for Sinar P-, C-, and F-series view cameras has the code 422.11, where 422 designates the class (monorail) and 11 designates the specific model / length / finish. In this case, the entire 42x class is reserved for monorails and monorail accessories. The base monorail unit (422.11) has two ends with threaded female sockets which each accept the standard male-threaded caps (429.11) or an extension rail, designated 421.11 for the extension; 423.11, extension; and 424.11, extension. Likewise, the rail caps which prevent unlocked standards from sliding off the end of the rail are designated 428.31 (female thread) and 429.11 (male thread). When the system was updated in the 1980s to the P2/ C2/ F2-series, the rails were given a black finish and redesignated 422.21 (base rail), 421.21 / 423.21 / 424.21 (extension rails), and a longer base rail was added, 425.21, double-ended with length.

The basic classes that make up a Sinar view camera include:
* 411: Rail clamp
* 422: Base monorail
* 431/437: Front standard
* 433: Rear standard
* 452: Bellows
* 461/462: Back (film holder / focusing screen)
;Notes
From the code numbers, the main differences between the P- (&quot;Perfection&quot;), C- (&quot;Combination&quot;), and F (&quot;Field&quot;)-series are the front and rear standards provided. As the name implies, the C-series combines the front (lens) standard from the F-series with the rear (image) standard from the P-series. A photographer who purchases an F-series camera can upgrade to the equivalent of a C- or P-series camera by changing the standards. In general, Sinar maintains broad component compatibility between the different modular view camera series and generations.

In addition, the same bellows are used for a certain size across all series, so changing format within a series is also possible. For example, the bellows used for all 4×5 cameras is coded 452.11; changing any 4×5 camera to a 5×7 camera would require a new bellows (452.17) along with an appropriate rear standard, frame, and film holder.

===Norma (Standard)===

The original view camera introduced in 1947 and manufactured until 1969 was called the Sinar Standard or, more popularly, Norma, as labeled on the default 30 cm monorail. It was sold in different film sizes (4×5, 5×7, or 8×10). Like the later P-, C-, and F-series, it is a modular system, which Sinar billed as the &quot;Construction-Unit&quot;, consisting of interchangeable basic components, including a tripod head (monorail clamp), tubular monorail, front and rear standards, and bellows connecting the standards; the only significant differences between the different film format sizes were the bellows, rear frame, and back.

Carl Koch applied for patents in 1947 and received them for the film holders, front and rear standards, the &quot;optical bench&quot; monorail, and the camera itself. The primary technical advantage of the Sinar over other view cameras was moving the pivoting point for each standard from the center of each frame to the bottom. This permits a greater range of tilt angles.

Sinar also marketed a version of the view camera with additional accessories, including a wide angle bellows and monorail extension, as the Sinar Expert.

===P-series===
The Sinar P, introduced in 1970, had asymmetric tilts and swings, as opposed to the traditional center or base tilts. This permitted rapid and precise settings without losing sharpness on the axis.

The P series also introduced features such as self-arresting rack and pinion gearing and a precision-engineered quick format change system that allows the photographer to switch between 4x5/5x7/8x10 formats quickly without having to fully disassemble the rear standard. This was accomplished by using a common rear standard bearer and unlocking a single knob to switch among the various format frames. Another new feature implemented in the P series was the Sinar system of calculating swings and tilts as well as the Sinar depth of field calculator. A key feature of the Sinar P system, particularly in the domain of scientific and industrial photography, is the precise machine tolerances that are part of the fittings and movements.

====X====
The Sinar X was offered as a lower-cost alternative to the p2 4×5, with the same range of possible movements but removing other features, such as the metering back and the ability to change film formats.

===F-series===
The F series was the light-weight version (&quot;F&quot; for &quot;Field&quot;), offering less refined features than the P series. The difference in weight is significant: the Sinar F 4x5 weighs about 3.3 kg and the Sinar P 4x5 weighs about 5.9 kg.

The original Sinar F is easily identified by a brushed aluminum monorail and other aluminum accents, while the Sinar F1, F2, and F3 models were made of the same materials, but painted black. The Sinar F also has hard plastic knobs, versus the rubber-coated knobs of the F1 and F2.

The Sinar F and F1 models have a clip-on front standard (lens standard) that does not fully enclose the monorail. The advantage is that this standard can easily be removed from the rail by loosening the clamp and lifting straight up, unlike the rear standard, and it is somewhat lighter weight. The disadvantage of this design is that the rail clamping mechanism is susceptible to breakage if over-tightened. The Sinar F2 and F3 models have a different front standard, which completely encloses the rail and also provides a geared focus adjustment, similar to the rear rail clamp on all Sinar F models. The correct F2 standard can easily be identified as it is a mirror image of the rear standard. The earlier F/F1 front standard has a low-profile metal hinge below the rail.

The F2 and F3 models also came standard with a light-metering back, while this was an option for the F and F1 models. The F3 model is a digital/analog model that supports a variety of Sinar digital lenses and digital backs.

===C-series===
As noted in Sinar literature, the C-series is a blend of the P- and F-series, using the same monorail and extensions as the other cameras, while fitted with the front standard of the F-series and the rear standard of the P-series.

===Alpina / A1===
The Alpina was introduced in the early 1980s as an entry-level alternative to the F-series. It accepts many of the same accessories and functions similarly to the F-series, using Sinar&#x27;s calculator scales, but the Alpina uses an extruded, trapezoidal monorail instead of the traditional Sinar tubular monorail, so the standards and rail are exclusive to the Alpina. The camera later was renamed as the a1 and reintroduced in the 1990s.

===Accessories===
Sinar has manufactured many accessories since its establishment:

A swing-out filter holder that allows the photographer to use a polarizing filter as well as 4x4 inch gel filters.

A 4x5 reflex attachment that employed an adjustable mirror to optimize viewing of the image. Adapters (now discontinued) were made by Sinar to adapt this viewer to various other view camera makes such as Plaubel, Linhof, and Toyo.

Many of the 4×5 backs will accept Graflok, Linhof, and Polaroid film accessories. For example, the 600KM back included with the &quot;Norma&quot; can be converted to accept accessories from other manufacturers by removing the frame. The Zoom series of roll film backs, which allow the use of 120/220 film formats from 6x4.5 to 6x12 formats with excellent film flatness. The earlier versions of the Zoom film backs are usable on any 4x5 camera with an international (Graflok) back (later holders no longer have the Graflok grooves required).

The Sinar LCD shutter system enables their CCD camera backs to have a much extended density range in video mode for focusing capability in a wider range of ambient lighting. This system has been used in modified mode by RIT to obtain multispectral images suited to aging analysis of color pigments in artworks.

Integration of Canon and Nikon SLR cameras as camera backs onto the P standard with adapters from fellow Swiss camera accessories manufacturer, Foba.

Instead of the traditional leaf shutter and diaphragm mechanisms, Sinar also offered an Automatic Shutter, which was self-cocking but offered a limited range of shutter speeds from 8 to  sec. and bulb; a Rear Set Diaphragm, which was independent of the lens, and an Automatic Diaphragm, which stopped down to a preset aperture once the film holder was inserted. Later cameras could be fitted with an electronically-timed shutter.

Film plane metering probes and meters.

Digital backs for the high-end studio environments.

<text>Shottery, formerly a small village a mile west of Stratford-upon-Avon town centre, is now part of the town, though retaining the feeling of a distinct village.

==History and amenities==
Shottery has a village hall, Shottery Memorial Hall, one secondary school, Stratford Girls&#x27; Grammar School, and one small primary school, Shottery St Andrew&#x27;s CofE Primary School that has been open since the mid-19th century. The school has been threatened with closure numerous times due to local spending cuts, however locals have always managed to raise the funds required to keep the school open. There is one pub (The Bell Inn), and the Santa Lucia Italian cuisine restaurant, opposite the pub, which has now closed. The latter building has long served as an eatery, and in Victorian times was a temperance movement soup kitchen. There was a Shottery Village Stores and Post Office, but it closed in the 1990s and is now a private home.

The local park, Shottery Fields, contains two football pitches and a children&#x27;s play area. The Fields retain distinctive &quot;ditch and furrow&quot; undulations, marking medieval field systems, and these can be seen when the sun is low across the Fields. The Fields also contain a footpath to the town centre. Shottery has a Rugby Club, Shottery RFC, which is now based at Stratford Rugby Club&#x27;s ground, Pearcecroft, on the Loxley Road, south Stratford. The club was founded by the Reverend David Capron, Vicar of St Andrew&#x27;s church in the year 1984. 

Shottery was the childhood home of Anne Hathaway, William Shakespeare&#x27;s wife, and is the location of the building known as Anne Hathaway&#x27;s Cottage which is a very popular tourist destination. The authenticity of the building as the home of Anne Hathaway is not credited by Shakespearean scholars.

==Governance==
Shottery is presently part of the civil parish of Stratford-upon-Avon, the &quot;Hathaway&quot; ward of Stratford-on-Avon District Council and the &quot;Stratford West&quot; division of Warwickshire County Council. The local MP (since the 2024 general election) is Manuela Perteghella of the Liberal Democrats.

<text>Regional autonomy is the authority of a region to govern and administer the interests of the local people according to its own initiatives. 21st-century examples of disputes over autonomy include the Basque Country and Catalonia in Spain, Sicily in Italy, and the disputes over autonomy of provinces in Indonesia. Other examples of autonomous regions include the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China and the Cherokee Nation in the United States. There is also an example of Sri Lanka where the Sri Lankan Tamils asked for regional autonomy and the government declined it, leading to struggle by the Tamil community.

<doc id="1212245" wikidata="Q151966" url="?curid=1212245" title="Callahan Tunnel">
<text>The Lieutenant William F. Callahan Jr. Tunnel (colloquially Callahan Tunnel) is one of four tunnels, and one of three road tunnels, beneath Boston Harbor in Boston, Massachusetts. It carries motor vehicles from the North End to Logan International Airport and Route 1A in East Boston. Ordinarily, this tunnel is only used to carry traffic out of the city, and with the completion of the Big Dig it only collects traffic from I-93 southbound (right after traffic merges from Storrow Drive) and downtown Boston; northbound traffic uses the Ted Williams Tunnel. As of 2016, a toll of $1.50 is charged for non-commercial two-axle vehicles with a Massachusetts E-ZPass, while non-Massachusetts E-ZPass holders are charged $1.75. Vehicles without E-ZPass are charged $2.05 through MassDOT&#x27;s Pay By Plate MA program. For residents of certain Boston ZIP codes, a discount is in effect using an E-ZPass transponder, costing $0.20.

==Alternatives==

Traffic flowing between Logan International Airport and directions south of the city on I-93 and west of the city on the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) normally uses the Ted Williams Tunnel rather than the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels. Airport traffic can also use East Boston surface roads to and from Chelsea (Chelsea Street Bridge), Revere (Massachusetts Route 1A) and Winthrop (Massachusetts Route 145).

==History==
The tunnel was opened in 1961. It was named for the son of Turnpike chairman William F. Callahan, who was killed in Italy days before the end of World War II. Formerly, control signals were used to reverse the direction of one lane in this tunnel or the Sumner Tunnel, when the opposite tunnel was closed for maintenance or emergencies. Under the relevant Turnpike regulations, a yellow signal light means &quot;proceed only as directed&quot;, on penalty of a $50 fine. As the signals are almost always yellow, this rule is universally ignored by drivers. Other markings in the tunnel include a &quot;double white line&quot; in the center, intended to discourage drivers from changing lanes, to be penalized with a $100 fine.

The Callahan Tunnel was repaired in the 1990s.

A major overhaul began in December 2013, which completely replaced the deck, curbs, and wall panels; and cleaned and repaired its ceiling and vent systems (above the ceiling and below the deck). It was planned for three phases: complete closure from December 27, 2013 to March 12, 2014 during deck and curb replacement; closures 11pm-5am from March 13, 2014 to late August 2014 for wall panel replacement; and final work until November 2014. McCourt Construction of South Boston was awarded the $19.3 million contract in August. During closures, Logan-bound traffic was diverted into the Ted Williams Tunnel, Tobin Bridge, and Massachusetts Route 1A South via Revere or East Boston. Starting with the Accelerated Bridge Program in the late 2000s, MassDOT began employing accelerated construction techniques, in which it signed contracts with incentives for early completion and penalties for late completion, and used intense construction during longer periods of complete closure to shorten the overall project duration and reduce cost. These techniques were also used for the Callahan Tunnel Rehabilitation Project.

In 2016, cashless tolling systems were installed in both directions, entering the Sumner Tunnel and exiting the Callahan Tunnel as part of a plan to modernize toll collection the Boston area.

<doc id="1212252" wikidata="Q554401" url="?curid=1212252" title="Lucius Caecilius Iucundus">
<text>Lucius Caecilius Iucundus (born , AD 27–) was a banker who lived in the Roman town of Pompeii around AD 14–62. His house still stands and can be seen in the ruins of the city of Pompeii which remain after being partially destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79. The house is known both for its frescoes and for the trove of wax tablets discovered there in 1875, which gave scholars access to the records of Iucundus&#x27;s banking operations.

Iucundus is the basis of the character Caecilius in the Cambridge Latin Course, a British series of Latin textbooks based around the life of Caecilius and his family. He is also the basis of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; character Lobus Caecilius, played by Peter Capaldi, whose fate is given symbolic importance for the version of the title character later portrayed by Capaldi. He also appears as a minor character in the novel &quot;Pompeii&quot; by Robert Harris.

== Life ==
Freedmen and slaves performed many small business tasks for Iucundus, such as signing receipts as witnesses and collecting payments from clients. The freedmen Phoebus, Communis and Chryseros are named in his records as acting for him, as are the slaves Philadelphus, Menippus and Dionysus. A further freedman named Felix has been suggested as the dedicator of the portrait herm of Iucundus found in the of the house. 
Many names of elite Pompeian citizens occur frequently in his transaction records, suggesting that Iucundus also had dealings with the upper class of his town. In fact, he even travelled to nearby Nuceria to help the wealthy Praetorian Guard senior centurion Publius Alfenus Varus resell some slaves that he had purchased in an auction.

He had at least two sons, Sextus Caecilius Iucundus Metellus and Quintus Caecilius Iucundus. Iucundus departed from the traditional naming system, giving each of his sons a name that implied a relationship with the illustrious family of the Caecilii Metelli. Little is known of either, though the incomplete state of the records of Iucundus&#x27;s business — which were buried in his house, alongside unfinished and unused tablets, in AD 79, but contain no records later than 62 — has been taken as evidence that they did not follow their father into the banking trade.

Little is known for sure about Iucundus&#x27;s life. He was born around the end of Augustus&#x27;s reign (that is, before ) to a freedman named Felix, who was also a banker. He is likely to have entered the banking business by AD 27. By AD 58 he was well-established as a successful banker who dealt with a wide variety of Pompeiians. He is believed to have had offices either in the or in his house, and to have worked alongside around six associates, including a freedman of the Helvii family named Apollonaris.
The tablets that Iucundus left behind suggest that he died in the earthquake on 5 February 62, since his records stop a few days before that date. His name does not appear in any known inscriptions from the 70s, and he was almost certainly dead by AD 79, by which point he would have been at least seventy.

== Banking in Pompeii ==
Caecilius was a type of banker called an , which meant that he acted as a middleman in auctions. The Pompeian would pay the vendor for the purchased item and then grant the buyer a time frame in which to repay him. According to the records of Caecilius, mostly dating from the 50s, the buyers had between a few months and a year to repay the loan to the .

The would receive interest on the loan, as well as a commission known as a . Some , called , collected debt money in addition to making arrangements in the auctions, while other were assisted by who collected the debts for them. It is uncertain whether Caecilius was a or simply an .

== Wax tablets ==
Iucundus kept many private records of his business transactions on wax tablets, many of which were found in his house in 1875. The state of these documents has been described as &quot;ruinous&quot;: many were charred beyond legibility by the eruption of Vesuvius.

All of the documents are receipts. Of the 153 tablets discovered, two date from AD 15 and 27, and so are likely the records of Iucundus&#x27;s father Felix; sixteen are receipts for contracts between Iucundus and the city of Pompeii, and the remaining 137 are receipts from auctions on behalf of third parties. Seventeen tablets record loans that Iucundus advanced to buyers of auction items. The tablets testify to the success of Iuncundus&#x27; business: all but three record transactions in excess of 1,000 (HS), while their median value is 4,500 HS and three record deals worth over 30,000 HS. A Roman legionary&#x27;s annual pay during the same period was 225 , or 900 HS. One receipt of 14 March AD 53 records the payment by Iucundus for a tax farming contract.

In addition to the transaction information, Iucundus&#x27;s tablets record the names of vendors and witnesses to the arrangements. The lists of witnesses also give some insight into the social structure of Pompeii, since Iucundus had his witnesses sign in order of social status. The tablets include a reference to the freedman Marcus Venerius Secundio, whose tomb in the Porta Sarno necropolis was excavated in 2021. In total, the names of around 115 people (excluding those acting as witnesses) are known from the tablets, of which fourteen — all sellers in auctions — belong to women.

The tablets themselves are mostly triptychs, which means that they have three wooden leaves tied together to make six pages. Wax was put on the inner four pages, and the receipt was written on these surfaces. The tablet was then closed and wrapped with a string, over which the witnesses placed their wax seals. This prevented the document itself from being altered, and there was a brief description of the receipt written on the outside for identification purposes. 

== Inscription from a tablet ==
The following is the translation of an AD 56 receipt for the proceeds of an auction sale.

In this inscription, Iucundus included the date and the list of witnesses, which were listed in descending order of social status. By examining several of his tablets, it is possible to determine the relative social standings of clients with whom Iucundus arranged numerous transactions.

== House ==

Iucundus&#x27;s house, known as the House of Lucius Caecilius Iucundus, still stands on what is now called the (Regio V, Insula 1.26) in Pompeii. It is known for the discovery of Iucundus&#x27;s business records and wax tablets, as well as for its wall-paintings. The , or shrine of the , features a relief depicting the Temple of Jupiter during the AD 62 earthquake. The was once decorated with paintings; the floor is decorated with a black and white mosaic and at the entrance a reclining dog is depicted. Most of these images are now displayed in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples.

Several graffiti messages have been found on the walls of the house, including one that reads &quot;May those who love prosper; let them perish who cannot love; let them perish twice over who forbid love.&quot; Another, which probably postdates Iucundus&#x27;s death, proclaims his son Quintus&#x27; support for Ceius Secundus, a candidate for the office of duumvir. 

The , or study, contains numerous wall paintings. An amphora given by one of his sons, Sextus, to the other, Quintus, was also found in the house.

In 2023 a marble relief depicting the earthquake of AD 62 that was stolen from the in 1975 was found in a house in Belgium.

== Depictions in fiction ==

The classicist Mary Beard has described Iucundus as &quot;a bit of a breakout star&quot;. Book One of the &quot;Cambridge Latin Course&quot; is a fictionalised account of the life of Iucundus, who is referred to as &quot;Caecilius&quot; in the series. In the &quot;Cambridge Latin Course&quot;, Caecilius has a wife, Metella; a daughter, Lucia; and a son, Quintus, on whom books two and three in the series are based. He also has two slaves; one named Clemens and another, a cook, named Grumio. It is also revealed that Caecilius once had another slave, Felix. However, after he saved Quintus from a kidnapping attempt, Caecilius manumitted him. In the &quot;Cambridge Latin Course&quot;, Caecilius dies in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.

Iucundus appears as a character in the 2003 novel &quot;Pompeii&quot; by Robert Harris. The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Ampliatus, works for Iucundus; in a 2024 interview, Harris described him as an &quot;enforcer&quot; for the latter. Harris has described Iucundus as an &quot;obvious&quot; inclusion in the story, and as an illustration of the dynamic nature of Roman society.

In a 2008 episode of British television science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; entitled &quot;The Fires of Pompeii&quot;, Peter Capaldi portrays Lobus Caecilius, a marble merchant based on Iucundus. In this story, he and his family are saved from the eruption by the Doctor, who transports them to safety. Capaldi later played the Doctor&#x27;s twelfth iteration; in a 2015 episode, the character explains that he chose to assume Caecilius&#x27;s appearance to remind him of his duty to save people like Caecilius. The show&#x27;s writer, Steven Moffat, said that the Doctor&#x27;s resemblance to Caecilius, as well as to a character named John Frobisher (also played by Capaldi) in the spin-off &quot;Torchwood&quot; series symbolised &quot;the Doctor&#x27;s eternal battle with doom and destiny&quot;.

<doc id="1212253" wikidata="Q312024" url="?curid=1212253" title="Ivan Bilibin">
<text>Ivan Yakovlevich Bilibin (, ; – 7 February 1942) was a Russian illustrator and stage designer who took part in the &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot; (&quot;World of Art&quot;), contributed to the Ballets Russes, co-founded the Union of Russian Artists, and from 1937 was a member of the Artists&#x27; Union of the USSR. Ivan Bilibin gained popularity with his illustrations of Russian folk tales and Slavic folklore. Throughout his career he was inspired by the art and culture of medieval Russia.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ivan Bilibin was born on in Tarkhovka, Saint Petersburg. He was born to Yakov Ivanovich Bilibin, assistant chief physician at the Saint Petersburg Naval Hospital, and Vavara Alexandrova Bilibina ( Bubnova). 

In 1890, Bilibin was accepted into the First Saint Petersburg Gymnasium. He graduated from the Gymnasium with a silver medal in 1896. From 1895 to the spring of 1898, he studied at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. In 1896 Bilibin began studying at the law faculty of the University of Saint Petersburg, and he completed his course there in 1900. Bilibin received a lawyer&#x27;s diploma in the same year from the Law Faculty of Novorossiysk University.

In 1898 he studied at Anton Ažbe&#x27;s Art School in Munich, where he was heavily influenced by Art Nouveau and the German satirical journal &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;, and then under Ilya Repin at Princess Maria Tenisheva&#x27;s School in Saint Petersburg from 1898 to 1900. 

Bilibin gained some success as early as 1899, when he first released illustrations for Russian fairy tales. The same year, after the formation of the artists&#x27; association Mir Iskusstva, in which Bilibin was an active member, his career as an illustrator of books and magazines began with a commission for its magazine &quot;Mir Iskusstva&quot;. He later also contributed essays on Russian folk art. Artistic designs for other magazines such as &quot;Dog Rose&quot; (Шиповник) and productions of a Moscow publishing house followed. 

After graduating in May 1901, Bilibin went to Munich, where he completed his training with the painter Anton Ažbe.

In the period 1902 to 1904, working under the Russian Museum (Museum of His Imperial Majesty Alexander III) Bilibin traveled to the Vologda, Olonetsk, and Arkhangelsk Governorates, performing ethnographic research and studying examples of Russian wooden architecture. In 1904 he published his findings in the monograph &quot;Folk Arts of the Russian North&quot;. Old Russian art had a great influence on his work. Another influence on his art was traditional Japanese prints and Renaissance woodcuts. On 16 December 1903 Bilibin became one of the founding members of the Union of Russian Artists. 

During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Bilibin drew revolutionary cartoons, especially for the magazine &quot;Zhupel&quot; (Жупелъ), which in 1906 was banned because of his illustration depicting the emperor as a donkey. In 1909 Bilibin served as the designer for the first stage production of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;.

In 1910, Bilibin left the Union of Russian Artists, as a result of differences in approach to their creative work. 

In 1911, Bilibin was hired by the State Paper Manufacturing Section to illustrate ball programs, exhibition and book posters, postcards for the Red Cross&#x27;s Society of St. Eugenia, and envelopes and stationery with the Russian Bogatyrs.

In March 1916 Bilibin was elected chairman of the World of Art group. 

On 22 September 1917, shortly before the October Revolution, Bilibin left Petrograd for Crimea, where he lived and worked until September 1919. He moved to Rostov-on-Don in October, and Novorossiysk in December 1919.

===Egypt===
On 13 March 1920, fleeing the Russian Civil War, Bilibin arrived in Alexandria where he spent quarantine, before moving to the Tell El Kebir refugee camp. In May, he settled in Cairo. In Cairo, he painted for the Greek colony, specialising in the Byzantine style art that was in demand by the Greek colony for icons and frescoes. He painted Egyptian landscapes, and studied Egyptian, Coptic and Arab art. He was also enraptured by the architecture of mosques and their &quot;head-spinning ornamentation&quot;. 

In the Summer on 1924, Bilbin, his wife and step-son travelled to Palestine and Syria, where he painted landscapes. 

On his return to Egypt in October 1924, Bilibin settled in Alexandria. 

===France===
In August 1925, Bilibin and his family moved to Paris, where he took to decorating private houses and Orthodox churches. The catalyst to the move was to attend the World Exhibition in Paris. 

===Return to Russia===
On 16 September 1936, Bilibin and his family returned to the Soviet Union, arriving in Leningrad. Three days later, Bilibin was appointed professor of graphic art at the &quot;Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture&quot; at the All-Russian Academy of Arts. He remained in position until his death. 

On 15 March 1937, Bilibin joined the Artists&#x27; Union of the USSR. 

On 7 February 1942, Bilibin died during the Siege of Leningrad, starving within the city when he refused to leave, and was buried in a collective grave. 
==Personal life==
On 28 April 1902, Bilibin married his former student and fellow pupil at the Tenisheva studio, Irish-Russian painter and illustrator of children&#x27;s stories Maria Chambers. They had two sons; Alexander (9 January 1903 – 1972; artist) and Ivan (1908–1993; journalist).

At the end of 1912, Bilibin entered a common law marriage with former student and artist Renée O&#x27;Connell (although Bilibin was still legally married to his first wife, Maria Chambers). Bilibin was 15 years her senior, and together they travelled around the Crimean peninsula to draw. 

The relationship struggled due to Bilibin&#x27;s drinking. The couple entered an agreement, witnessed by their friend musician Stepan Stepanovich Mitusov, that if Bilibin did not drink for a year, then O&#x27;Connell would stay with him. Bilibin did not keep his word, and O&#x27;Connell left Bilibin in September 1917, with Bilibin travelling to Crimea alone following the events of the Russian Revolution.

Mitusov wrote a comic poem about the breakdown of the couple&#x27;s relationship.

Bilibin wrote to Maria Chambers in 1922, asking for a divorce (in order for Bilibin to marry Shchekatikhina), to which she did not respond. However, they were divorced by 1923.

In February 1923 he married the painter Aleksandra Shchekatikhina-Pototskaya, with whom he had a joint exhibition in Amsterdam in 1929.

<doc id="1212255" wikidata="Q2090194" url="?curid=1212255" title="Eastern Guinean forests">
<text>The Eastern Guinean forests are a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion of West Africa.

==Geography==
The ecoregion includes the lowland forests extending from the Gulf of Guinea a few hundred kilometres inland, from western Côte d&#x27;Ivoire to the western shore of Lake Volta in Ghana. A few enclaves lie further east and inland in the Togo Mountains of Togo, eastern Ghana, and Benin. The Sassandra River of Cote d&#x27;Ivoire separates the Eastern Guinean forests from the Western Guinean forests which lie to the west. Inland and to the east, the Eastern Guinean forests transition to the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic.

Cities in the ecoregion include Abidjan and Yamoussoukro in Ivory Coast and Kumasi in Ghana.

The Eastern Guinean forests, together with the other tropical moist broadleaf forests of West Africa, is included within Conservation International&#x27;s Guinean Forests of West Africa biodiversity hotspot.

==Climate==
The climate is tropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Average annual rainfall ranges from 2500 mm in the west, declining as one moves inland to 1500 mm along the northern edge and in the mountains of Togo and Benin.

==Flora==
Tropical moist forest is the predominant vegetation type. Moist evergreen forest is found in the west and along the coast, transitioning to moist semi-evergreen forest further inland, and dry semi-evergreen forest in the north.

Characteristic trees of the moist evergreen forest are &quot;Entandrophragma utile, Khaya ivorensis&quot;, and &quot;Triplochiton scleroxylon&quot;. Dominant trees in the moist semi-evergreen forests are &quot;Celtis&quot; spp., &quot;Mansonia altissima, Pterygota macrocarpa, Nesogordonia papaverifera, Sterculia rhinopetala&quot;, and &quot;Milicia excelsa&quot;. Trees of the Togo Mountains forests include &quot;Milicia excelsa, Triplochiton scleroxylon, Antiaris toxicaria africana, Diospyros mespiliformis, Afzelia africana&quot;, and &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;.

==Fauna==
Four mammals are endemic to the ecoregion – Wimmer&#x27;s shrew (&quot;Crocidura wimmeri&quot;), Ivory Coast rat (&quot;Dephomys eburneae&quot;), Cansdale&#x27;s swamp rat (&quot;Malacomys cansdalei&quot;), and Togo mouse (&quot;Leimacomys buettneri&quot;).

==Protected areas==
A 2017 assessment found that 42,299 km², or 23%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. About one-third of the unprotected area is still forested. Protected areas include Gaoulou Natural Park and the southern and western portions of Marahoue National Park in Ivory Coast, and Bia National Park, Kakum National Park, Nini-Suhien National Park, Agmatsa Wildlife Reserve, Boin Tano Forest Reserve, and Mamiri Forest Reserve in Ghana.

<text>The Sumner Tunnel is a road tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It carries traffic under Boston Harbor in one direction, from Logan International Airport and Route 1A in East Boston. The tunnel originally deposited traffic at the west side of the North End, but with the completion of the Big Dig, it was modified to have two exits. One exit connects to I-93 northbound and downtown Boston (Government Center) near Haymarket Station. The other exit connects to Storrow Drive and Nashua St., connecting Cambridge via Route 28. Traffic headed for I-93 southbound and the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) westbound is normally routed to the Ted Williams Tunnel. It is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

==History==
The Sumner Tunnel was opened on June 30, 1934. It carried traffic in both directions until the opening of the parallel Callahan Tunnel in 1961. The Sumner Tunnel is named for William H. Sumner, the son of Governor Increase Sumner.

Until 2009, it was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, when it was transferred to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

, a toll of $1.50 is charged for non-commercial two-axle vehicles with a Massachusetts E-ZPass, while non-Massachusetts E-ZPass holders are charged $1.75. Vehicles without E-ZPass are charged $2.05 through MassDOT&#x27;s Pay by Plate MA program. For residents of certain Boston ZIP Codes, a discount is in effect using an E-ZPass transponder, costing $0.20. On November 14, 2008, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority voted in favor of a proposed toll hike which would double the toll to $7.00 for non-commercial vehicles (at the time, the toll was $3.50 in the southbound direction only). E-ZPass users would receive a $1.00 discount and commercial vehicles would end up having to pay $9.00. This vote was later rescinded following a vote approving a 1.25% sales tax increase.

In 2016, cashless tolling systems were installed in both directions, entering the Sumner Tunnel and exiting the Callahan Tunnel as part of a plan to modernize toll collection in the Boston area.

The tunnel has been shut intermittently for modernization from summer 2022 through summer 2024. It will be fully closed from July 5 and August 5, 2024, and on weekends from August 9 through November 15, except for August 30 and October 11.

<text>Geraldine Whittington (September 11, 1931 – January 24, 1993) was the personal executive secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was the first African-American secretary in the White House.

Johnson was famous for working long hours and insisting his assistants worked long hours as well. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson became president, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Whittington working in a government office, and requested that his assistant Jack Valenti get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening, and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson&#x27;s phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke, but came to believe that it really was the president on the line. She applied for the job and was offered the position.

Having a black woman in the White House was very unusual in the early 1960s. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he had hired a black woman, but chose not to call a news conference. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, wherein contestants attempted to guess her profession. This may have seemed less overt, but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held.

Whittington appeared on episode #696 of the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on January 19, 1964. She was the first contestant. The mystery guest that evening was Van Heflin and the panel consisted of Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, Dorothy Kilgallen, and Bennett Cerf. After Whittington signed the blackboard as &quot;Jerri Whittington,&quot; she told host John Daly that she was from West River, Maryland. Whittington&#x27;s occupation was shown on the screen as &quot;Secretary to President Johnson.&quot; After her game, she described President Lyndon Johnson with the following words, &quot;great warmth, fair, kind, a perfectionist.&quot;

Later Whittington appeared in several magazines, including &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Sepia&quot;.

She was the first person to learn that Justice Thurgood Marshall had been nominated by President Johnson to the Supreme Court. Minutes before LBJ made the official announcement, he took his nominee down to her office and said, &quot;Here&#x27;s the next Supreme Court Justice!&quot; She told friends that she thanked the President for making the choice of the first Black court justice. 

After suffering a stroke at age 38, Ms. Whittington died of cancer at age 61 in Washington, DC, on January 24, 1993, on the same day as Justice Thurgood Marshall.

<doc id="1212264" wikidata="Q2348040" url="?curid=1212264" title="La Galatea">
<text>La Galatea () was Miguel de Cervantes’ first book, published in 1585. Under the guise of pastoral characters, it is an examination of love and contains many allusions to contemporary literary figures. It enjoyed modest success, but was not soon reprinted; its promised sequel was never published.

==Plot==

The main characters of the Galatea are Elicio and Erastro, best friends and both in love with Galatea. 
The novel opens with her and her best friend, Florisa, bathing, and talking of love.
Erastro and Elicio reveal to each other their desire for Galatea, but agree not to let it come between their friendship.
Eventually, all four of them begin their journey to the wedding of Daranio and Silveria, along which, in the pastoral tradition, they encounter other characters who tell their own stories and often join the traveling group.

The vast majority of the characters in the book are involved primarily in minor story lines.
Lisandro loses his love, Leonida, when Crisalvo mistakenly kills her instead of his former love Silvia.
Lisandro avenges Leonida&#x27;s death in the presence of the main party.
Astor, under the pseudonym Silerio, feigns attraction for Nísida&#x27;s sister Blanca in order to avoid the scorn of Nísida&#x27;s lover Timbrio, who dies following the confusion present after a successful duel against his rival Pransiles.
Astor&#x27;s grief thrusts him into hermitage, waiting to hear from Nísida.
Arsindo holds a poetry competition betwixt Francenio and Lauso, which is judged by Tirsi and Damón, lauded by many within the novel as some of the most famous poets of Spain. The competition is determined to have no single winner.
The wedding has controversy as Mireno is deeply in love with Silveria, yet Daranio&#x27;s wealth guaranteed him the hand of Silveria.

These stories sometimes have characters that cross over, resulting in the sub-plots being intertwined at times.
For example, Teolinda, whose sister Leonida played in an integral role in separating Teolinda from her lover Artidoro, finds Leonida much later with a group of soldiers.
The fame of Tirsi and Damón instantly connects them with the hired wedding bards, Orompo, Crisio, Marsilio, and Orfenio, as well as the teacher Arsindo.

==Analysis==

&quot;La Galatea&quot; is an imitation of the &quot;Diana&quot; of Jorge de Montemayor, and shows an even greater resemblance to Gaspar Gil Polo&#x27;s continuation of the &quot;Diana&quot;. Next to &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the &quot;Novelas exemplares&quot;, his pastoral romance is considered particularly notable because it predicts the poetic direction in which Cervantes would go for the rest of his career. It possesses little originality, but is highly reminiscent of its models, and particularly of the &quot;Diana&quot; of Gil Polo. The name Galatea, as well as the format of a pastoral involving two characters competing over a girl examine love, is an imitation of Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues and the related classical pastoral material which Virgil himself drew from.

In composing this pastoral romance, Cervantes seems to have intended to use the tale merely as an excuse for a rich collection of poems in the old Spanish and Italian styles. The story is merely the thread, which holds the beautiful garland together; the poems are the portion most deserving of attention. They are many and various, and uphold Cervantes&#x27; claim to rank among the most eminent poets, whether in reference to verse or to prose. Should his originality in versified composition be called in question, a close study of &quot;Galatea&quot; must banish all doubt.

Although some contemporaries of Cervantes decried the quality of his dramatic works, when compared to those of Lope de Vega. the same is not true of his lyrical compositions. One contemporary, Luis Gálvez de Montalvo, in his 1582 novel, &quot;El pastor de Fílida&quot;, urges Cervantes to complete it. From the romance of &quot;Galatea&quot;, Cervantes composed in all the various kinds of syllabic measure used in his time. He even occasionally adopted the old dactylic stanza. He appears to have experienced some difficulty with the metrical form of the sonnet, but his poems in Italian octaves display great facility. Among these, the &quot;song of Caliope&quot;, in the last book of the &quot; Galatea&quot;, stands out.

In the same manner as Gil Polo did in his &quot;Diana&quot;, Cervantes makes the river Turia pronounce the praises of the celebrated Valencians. His poetic fancy summons the muse Calliope before the shepherds and shepherdesses, to render solemn homage to those contemporaries whom he esteems worthy of distinction as poets. The most widely admired poems in the &quot;Galatea&quot; are a few in the cancion style, some of which are iambics, and some in trochaic or Old Spanish verse. Cervantes has here and there indulged in those antiquated and fantastic plays of wit, which at a subsequent period he himself ridiculed.

=== Themes ===

;Upbringings and life-styles
:One of the primary treatments in the Galatea, and most evident in the contrast between Elicio and Erastro, is the perception of rural and city folk and their lives. Elicio, a cultured shepherd, and Erastro, a &quot;rústico ganadero&quot; (rustic herdsman) are an odd pair of friends, and throughout the novel their differing views come out in conversations with other characters. Erastro, though from the rural parts of Spain, is very eloquent in speech—a trait that surprises many. However, because of his background, Erastro feels disadvantaged in his desire for Galatea, who had a very cultured upbringing similar to Elicio’s. A similar discussion ensues when a group of soldiers meets the group and one of them, Darinto, describes his view of pastoral (or rural) life as being a simple one, without all the complications, formalities and expenses of city life. Damón replies that the rural life is not as glorious or desirable as Darinto imagines: there are just as many chores and other things to do in country life as in city life, and so is not the relaxing simple life described.
;Friendship
;Love, affection, and desire 

==Second part==
The original title published with the work now simply known as the Galatea was &quot;La primera parte de la Galatea&quot; (The First Part of the Galatea).

Cervantes indicated on numerous occasions during his life he planned to publish a second part, even in the ending of the first part:

In Cervantes&#x27; later novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;La Galatea&quot; appears in the book burning scene. Its worth is measured as satisfactory in itself, but both the Barber and Curate agree the plot matters little without a Second Part.
The Galatea enjoyed moderate success, but any work that Cervantes may have begun on a conclusion was lost to history following his death.

==In other media==
The book is used in the Starz series, Black Sails. In the third episode of the second season, Captain Flint leaves a copy of &quot;La Galatea&quot; at the doorstep of his close friend, Miranda Barlow.

Smith was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in a middle-class neighborhood located in Southwest Atlanta. He is the oldest of five children born to his father, an aerospace engineer with former military service, and his mother, with a medical career within the military. Three of his siblings would later follow their parents&#x27; lead and also serve in the United States military.

Smith attended Beecher Hills Elementary School and Southwest Middle School, both located within the Atlanta Public School district. His mother described him as a high achiever early on in addition to being independent and a passionate reader. While in middle school, Smith became lifelong friends with Robert McDowell, Dwayne &quot;Emperor&quot; Searcy (future DJ and radio personality for Radio One&#x27;s WHTA), and Vince Phillips (named as one of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Music Lawyers since 2020), who would become business partners. The foursome quickly became immersed in the skateboarding culture and would later work at Skate Escape, a popular skate and bicycle shop near the city&#x27;s iconic Piedmont Park. While his best friends attended Benjamin E. Mays High School, Smith attended Frederick Douglass High School for their magnet program and was a member of the marching band. They also began to frequently attend concerts at the Masquerade, to see their favorite bands, including Agent Orange and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

At the age of 15, Smith taught himself how to DJ, and although his parents were strict, they gave him a chance to work on his DJ skills by allowing him to have house parties in the basement of the family home, citing that they would rather have him under their watch than for him to &quot;be in the street somewhere&quot;. The parties, hosted by Smith and Searcy &quot;Old E and Chicken Parties&quot;, became popular with local teens. In addition to working at the skate shop, Smith also began spinning at house parties and working in local dance clubs as a DJ. Eventually Smith became an in house DJ at Phoenix, a popular Atlanta nightclub at the time. It was there he would meet established music artists such as Jermaine Dupri, TLC, the Notorious B.I.G., Craig Mack and Mary J. Blige.

==Career==
=== 1991–2000: So So Def ===
After graduating from high school, Lil Jon continued to work as a DJ in popular downtown Atlanta clubs. It was there he met Jermaine Dupri. When it came to hiring an A&amp;R to lead his Atlanta-based music label So So Def, Dupri stated that &quot;All I could think about was Lil Jon, because he was the person in the clubs. He knew people, DJs knew him. I had to hire him.&quot;

After he was promoted to Executive Vice President of A&amp;R, Lil Jon recruited DJ Smurf, Shawty Redd, Raheem the Dream, and Playa Poncho with others to create the compilation album series, &quot;So So Def Bass All Stars&quot; as his first project. Released on May 12, 1996, the album was a success, selling over 500,000 units and was certified gold by the RIAA on September 19, 1996, four months after its initial release. The album, executive produced by Lil Jon, included the hit single &quot;My Boo&quot; by Ghost Town DJ&#x27;s. It was sampled by Ciara in her 2013 hit &quot;Body Party&quot;. In 2016, 20 years after its initial release, the song re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at No. 29 due to a viral dance video. Lil Jon completed the series, releasing &quot;So So Def Bass All-Stars Vol. II&quot; (1997) and &quot;So So Def Bass All-Stars Vol. III&quot; (1998).

=== 1995–2005: Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz ===
In 1995, Lil Jon collaborated with Big Sam and Lil&#x27; Bo to form a musical rap group: the East Side Boyz.

In 1996, the group released their debut single, &quot;Who U Wit?&quot;. The song is credited as bringing the term &quot;crunk&quot; into hip-hop currency. In 1997, the group released their debut album &quot;Get Crunk, Who U Wit: Da Album&quot;. The singles &quot;Who U Wit?&quot;, produced by Lil Jon, and &quot;Shawty Freak a Lil Sumthin&quot;, produced by DJ Toomp, charted on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at No. 70 and No. 62, respectively.

In 2000, through the newly created label Black Market, the group released their breakthrough album &quot;We Still Crunk!!&quot; which featured the single &quot;I Like Dem Girlz&quot; which reached No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Rap Tracks chart.

Bryan Leach, formerly an A&amp;R executive at the now defunct New York based label TVT Records, heard about the group and attended their Atlanta show. He was blown away by the group&#x27;s immense energy. Leach told HitQuarters: &quot;It was like early Beastie Boys, when they had the energy of a rock group but they were rapping, and that energy is what crunk music is all about.&quot; By 2002, Leach signed Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz to TVT Records with Black Market delivering the albums to the label. The group released the album &quot;Put Yo Hood Up&quot;, which combined previously released tracks with new ones. &quot;Bia&#x27; Bia&#x27;&quot;, which featured Ludacris, Too Short, Big Kap, and Chyna Whyte was the group&#x27;s first single to be played nationally. &quot;Bia&#x27; Bia&#x27;&quot; peaked at No. 97 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in June 2002.

In 2002, the group released their sophomore studio album under the label &quot;Kings of Crunk&quot; with the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; as the first single. The song featured former No Limit Records artist Mystikal and former Ruthless Records artist, Krayzie Bone. It peaked at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Get Low&quot; featured fellow Atlanta hip-hop group Ying Yang Twins and became popular in nightclubs nationwide; it reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album was certified multi-platinum by the RIAA in August 2004. The song was also featured in &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot;, which plays in the main menu as well as gameplay. In 2003, the group released &quot;Part II&quot;, a remix album of previously released singles with a two new songs.

In 2004, Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz released what would be the group&#x27;s last studio album, &quot;Crunk Juice&quot;.

== Musical style and influences ==
Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic has described Lil Jon&#x27;s production as &quot;bass-heavy&quot;, and his album &quot;Put Yo Hood Up&quot; as having &quot;a long and varied list of guest rappers to accompany the beats&quot;. Describing that album with guest performers, Birchmeier remarked: &quot;The end result is an album that resembles a street-level mixtape rather than a traditional artist-oriented album&quot;.

Lil Jon was specifically influenced by 2 Live Crew, 8Ball &amp; MJG, Three 6 Mafia, Outkast, Geto Boys, UGK, N.W.A, Dr. Dre, and Sir Mix-a-Lot. Alex Henderson, also of AllMusic, contrasted Lil Jon&#x27;s style of &quot;rowdy, in-your-face, profanity-filled party music&quot; with other Southern rappers, those who &quot;have a gangsta/thug life agenda&quot; and those who convey &quot;serious sociopolitical messages&quot;. Lil Jon has also found influence in rock music, having worked with Rick Rubin and Korn. He expresses this influence in his aggressive delivery and &#x27;yelling&#x27; style of rap. He was seen on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time program wearing a Bad Brains T-shirt, and he used to listen to Lynyrd Skynyrd while growing up in the South in the 1970s.

He also follows the Las Vegas teams, claiming that being in the city during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and seeing the community response made him want to support what he calls his second home. His support for the Vegas Golden Knights led to him appearing in the team 2019 documentary &quot;Valiant&quot;, and being given a Stanley Cup ring after their 2023 title, which he wore during the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show. He is also a fan of University of Tennessee Volunteers and DJ Sterl the Pearl, who adopted his hit song &quot;Turn Down for What&quot; on third downs, changing it to &quot;Third Down for What&quot;. On October 4, 2014, Lil Jon made an appearance via Jumbotron encouraging the Volunteers to beat the University of Florida Gators; and also visited the Volunteers, giving them a pep talk.

<text>The Llandoger Trow is a historic public house in Bristol, south-west England. Dating from 1664, it is on King Street, between Welsh Back and Queen Charlotte Street, near the old city centre docks. Named by a sailor, Joe McMahon, who owned the pub after Llandogo in Wales which built trows (flat-bottomed river boats), the building was damaged in World War II, but remained in sufficiently good condition to be designated Grade II* listed building status in 1959. The pub is said to have inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write of the Admiral Benbow Inn in &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and Daniel Defoe supposedly met William Dampier and Alexander Selkirk there, his inspiration for &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. The pub is also supposedly haunted, with up to 15 ghosts and one little green ghoul, the best known being a small man called Uncle Piebeau whose footsteps can be heard on the top floor.

On 20 April 2019 the pub was closed, but has now re-opened as part of the Bloomsbury Leisure group.

==History==

The building dates from 1664, originally a row of three houses. It was built on a timber box frame, with brick stacks. The pub has an 18th-century shop front, but the main door dates from the 20th century. The pub was partially destroyed by a bomb in World War II, but three of the original five projecting gables remain. It was designated a Grade II* listed building on 8 January 1959.

Tradition has it that Daniel Defoe met William Dampier William_Dampier and Alexander Selkirk, his inspiration for &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, here, and it was Robert Louis Stevenson’s inspiration for the Admiral Benbow in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. In the Victorian era the pub was associated with the Theatre Royal, which is across the road, and was visited by many performers and musicians including Henry Irving.

==Name==
A &quot;trow&quot; was a flat-bottomed barge, and Llandogo is a village north-west of Bristol, across the Severn Estuary and upstream on the River Wye in South Wales, where trows were once built. Trows historically sailed to trade in Bristol from Llandogo. The pub was named by Captain Joe McMahon, a sailor who lived in Llandogo and ran the pub.

==Modern usage==
In 1962 it became a Berni Inn, and until 2019 was operated by Whitbread and traded as a Brewers Fayre. In 2007, The Llandoger Trow was one of the three locations seen in the &quot;Pirate&#x27;s Cove&quot; episode of &quot;Most Haunted Live!&quot; The others were Blackbeard&#x27;s houses and Redcliffe Caves. The most popular ghost story associated with the pub is that of a small child who wore leg braces and haunts the top floor, their footsteps heard at night. The programme claimed that there were at least 15 ghosts at the Llandoger Trow, and since 2009 the owners have organised ghost hunts overnight.

In 2019 Whitbread decided to close the Llandoger Trow as it did not fit Whitbread&#x27;s style of pubs, and it needed repairs at an estimated cost exceeding £2 million. It closed on 20 April 2019. Whitbread stated they intended to sell the building as a going concern. It was purchased by the Bloomsbury Leisure Group and reopened in 2021

== In Popular Culture ==
The Longest Johns, a Bristol-based folk musical group, paid homage to the Llandoger Trow with their song &quot;Llandoger,&quot; featured as the opening track on their album, &quot;Voyage&quot;, released on 9 February 2024. The debut performance of the song took place on the Jingle Jam charity drive livestream on 4 December 2023.
