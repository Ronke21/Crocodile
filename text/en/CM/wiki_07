<text>John M. &quot;Red&quot; Pollard (October 27, 1909 – March 7, 1981) was a Canadian horse racing jockey. A founding member of the Jockeys&#x27; Guild in 1940, Pollard rode at racetracks in the United States and is best known for riding Seabiscuit.

==Family history==
Red Pollard was the grandson of Michael Pollard, born in 1834 in Ireland. Michael emigrated to New Jersey in 1850, moved to Illinois by 1855, and in 1863 married Irish immigrant Bridget Moloney. They moved to Iowa in 1870, where Red&#x27;s father, John A., was born in 1875.

John A. immigrated to Edmonton, Alberta, in 1898. After the turn of the century, he and his brother Frank founded the Pollard Bros Brickyard.

John M. &quot;Red&quot; Pollard was born in Edmonton in 1909. He spent his early years in affluence, but the family brickyard was destroyed when the North Saskatchewan River flooded in 1915, instantly throwing the family into poverty.

==Career==
Red Pollard stood and weighed , which is considered big for a jockey. In 1933, Pollard rode in Ontario at the Fort Erie racetrack. Early in his career, he lost the vision in his right eye due to a traumatic brain injury. This injury occurred when he was hit in the head by a rock thrown up by another horse during a training ride. Because he would not have been allowed to ride had the full extent of his injury been known, he kept his vision loss a secret for the rest of his riding career.

Down and out in Detroit in 1936, Pollard was hired by horse trainer Tom Smith to ride Charles S. Howard&#x27;s Seabiscuit. The team&#x27;s first stakes win came in the 1936 Governor&#x27;s Handicap. Pollard and Seabiscuit won numerous important races, including the 1937 Brooklyn Handicap at Old Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, the 1937 Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in Boston, and famously lost by a nose at the 1937 Santa Anita Handicap. Pollard and Seabiscuit were considered by most as the best pairing of race horse and jockey in the US at that time. In 1940, Pollard jockeyed the then 7-year-old Seabiscuit to a win in the Santa Anita Handicap at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. It was Seabiscuit&#x27;s last race. Pollard rode Seabiscuit 30 times with 18 wins - all of them stakes or handicaps.

Following the 1940 season, Pollard bought a house in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Pollard continued to ride into the 1950s, mostly in New England. Eventually, he became a jockey&#x27;s valet at Narragansett Park in Rhode Island.

== Honors, awards, and portrayals==
In 1982, Pollard was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

Actor Tobey Maguire portrays Pollard in the 2003 film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;.

==Personal life==
Besides the previously referenced damage to his vision, Pollard was known for other severe injuries that he suffered. In February 1938, Pollard fell while racing on Fair Knightess, another horse owned by Howard. His chest was crushed by the weight of the falling animal, and his ribs and arm were broken. He had extensive surgery, and almost did not survive. He recovered, and was working again by the July of the same year, when he had a compound fracture in his leg from a runaway horse. When he had nearly recovered, while walking the hills of Howard&#x27;s estate, he broke his leg again when he stepped into a hole. Howard, who thought of Pollard as a son, paid for his hospital stays throughout their time together.

While recuperating from his July 1938 injuries, Pollard fell in love with his nurse, Agnes Conlon. They were married the following year and had two children, Norah and John.

Pollard died on March 7, 1981, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He is buried at Notre Dame Cemetery, a mile north of Narragansett Park racetrack, beside his wife.

<doc id="1193240" wikidata="Q6792393" url="?curid=1193240" title="Maui gas field">
<text>The Maui natural gas field is the largest gas, natural gas condensate and oil field in New Zealand, producing nearly three-quarters of the country&#x27;s hydrocarbons, as well as providing energy for electricity generation. It is located in the Tasman Sea, 35 km off the coast of Taranaki and to the southwest of New Plymouth. It covers an area of 157 square kilometres and is located in 110 metres of water.

The gas field was discovered in 1969 by a joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell, British Petroleum and Todd Petroleum. It was considered a &quot;giant&quot; field at the time of discovery. Government investment led to a government organisation later called Petrocorp taking a 50% interest. This was later bought out by Fletcher Challenge Energy. By the end of the Maui gas contract in 2009, the Maui Mining Companies were made up of Shell (83.75%), OMV New Zealand (10%), and Todd Energy (6.25%). OMV New Zealand owns and operates the Maui gas field having acquired the 83.75% share from Shell Exploration NZ and the 6.25% share from Todd Energy since the end of 2018.

Two platforms operate in the field: full production from Maui A began in 1979; Maui B was installed 13 years later. Much of the gas from Maui was used to supply the Motunui synthetic petrol plant from 1986 until it ceased operation in 2004. An onshore naphtha refining plant was installed in 1999. The floating production storage and offloading vessel &quot;Whakaaropai&quot; was installed as part of the final development phases in 1996, for the production of oil from Maui B. It was sold in 2005 when the recoverable oil reserves had been exhausted.

Gas is piped to power stations for electricity generation at Stratford and Huntly. Electricity production from the gas grew steadily from the 1970s, with it providing 30% of New Zealand&#x27;s electricity in 2002. Production declined in the 2000s as the gas was depleted, providing just 16% of the country&#x27;s electricity in 2005. The gas is also distributed through high-pressure pipelines for industrial and domestic use around the North Island. This used 30% of the gas produced in 2005.

In 2005, the Maui fields oil reserves were estimated to be 92% depleted, and the Maui field gas reserves were estimated to be 91% depleted.

In 2014, the New Zealand government revised its published estimates of natural gas reserves. &quot;The biggest news of the recalculation involves one of the oldest gas producers. When the offshore Maui field was discovered in 1969 and
developed 10 years later, it was forecast it would be exhausted in 30 years. But now its remaining proved reserves have been doubled to 133 PJ
and its 2P reserves more than doubled to 466 PJ&quot;.

<doc id="1193243" wikidata="Q12720211" url="?curid=1193243" title="1853 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1853 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s first term. It was the first national election ever held in New Zealand, although Parliament did not yet have full authority to govern the colony, which was part of the British Empire at that time. Elections for the first provincial councils and their Superintendents were held at the same time.

==Background==

The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, established a bicameral New Zealand Parliament, with the lower house (the House of Representatives) being elected by popular vote. Votes were to be cast under a simple FPP system, and the secret ballot had not yet been introduced.

To qualify as a voter, one needed to be male, to be a British subject, to be at least 21 years old, to own a certain value of land, and to not be serving a criminal sentence. One of the candidates elected (on 27 August, for Christchurch Country) was a landowner, but at 20 years and 7 months was not yet 21: he was James Stuart-Wortley.

At the time of the 1853 elections, there were no political parties in New Zealand. As such, all candidates were independents.

==The election==
In the 1853 elections, election day was different in each seat. The first seat to be elected was Bay of Islands on 14 July, and the final election day was on 1 October. Hugh Carleton (Bay of Islands) was the first MP ever elected in New Zealand (though he was elected unopposed), so he liked to be called the Father of the House.

There were 5,849 people registered to vote.

The total number of seats was 37.

The number of electoral districts was 24. Some districts elected multiple MPs (they elected using block voting). Wellington and Auckland had three members each. Some parts of the colony were not part of any district, and did not have representation in Parliament.

<doc id="1193260" wikidata="Q827005" url="?curid=1193260" title="Crown–Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada">
<text>Crown&quot;–&quot;Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC; ) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for Canada&#x27;s northern lands and territories, and one of two departments with responsibility for policies relating to Indigenous peoples in Canada (the other being the Department of Indigenous Services, or ISC).

CIRNAC, along with ISC, were established to replace the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND).

The department is overseen by two cabinet ministers, the Minister of Crown–Indigenous relations (whose portfolio includes treaty rights and land negotiations) and the Minister of Northern Affairs. Its headquarters is in Terrasses de la Chaudière, in downtown Gatineau, Quebec.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;First Nation&quot; has been used since the 1970s instead of the word &quot;Indian&quot;, which some people found offensive.

The term &quot;Indian&quot; is used for legal and historical documents such as Status Indians as defined by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. For example, the term &quot;Indian&quot; continues to be used in the historical and legal document, the Canadian Constitution and federal statutes. The then-Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada used the term &quot;Inuit&quot; in referring to &quot;an Aboriginal people in Northern Canada, who live in Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Northern Quebec and Northern Labrador. The word means &#x27;people&#x27; in the Inuit language — Inuktitut. The singular of Inuit is Inuk.&quot;

&quot;Eskimo&quot; is found in historical documents about Canadian Inuit.
The term &quot;Aboriginal&quot; is commonly used when referring to the three groups of indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) as a whole. It is also used by Aboriginal people who live within Canada who claim rights of sovereignty or Aboriginal title to lands.

==Departmental mandate==
CIRNAC is one of the federal government departments responsible for meeting the Government of Canada&#x27;s obligations and commitments to First Nations, Inuit and Métis, and for fulfilling the federal government&#x27;s constitutional responsibilities in the North. The department&#x27;s responsibilities are largely determined by numerous statutes, negotiated agreements and relevant legal decisions. Most of the department&#x27;s programs, representing a majority of its spending - are delivered through partnerships with Aboriginal communities and federal-provincial or federal-territorial agreements. CIRNAC also works with urban Indigenous people, Métis and Non-Status Indians (many of whom live in rural areas).

CIRNAC supports indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) and Northerners in their efforts to:
* improve social well-being and economic prosperity;
* develop healthier, more sustainable communities; and
* participate more fully in Canada&#x27;s political, social and economic development to the benefit of all Canadians.

CIRNAC also works with urban First Nations, Métis and Non-Status Indians (many of whom live in rural areas) through the Office of the Federal Interlocutor. CIRNAC also manages the resources of federal lands, including land and subsurface leases and resource royalties.

==History==
===Aboriginal Affairs===

In 1755, the British Crown established the Indian Department. The Governor General of Canada held control of Indian affairs, but usually delegated much of their responsibility to subordinate civil secretaries. In 1860, the responsibility for Indian affairs was transferred from the British government to the Province of Canada; the responsibility for Indian affairs was then delegated to the Crown Lands Department Commissions Responsible for Indian Affairs.

The federal government&#x27;s legislative responsibilities for First Nations and the Inuit derive from section 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; and responsibility was given to the Secretary of State for the Provinces Responsible for Indian Affairs. In 1876, the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, which remains the major expression of federal jurisdiction in this area, was passed and a series of treaties were concluded between Canada and the various Indian bands across the country.

The responsibility for Indian Affairs and Northern Development rested with various government departments between 1873 and 1966. The Minister of the Interior also held the position of Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs after the Indian Affairs Department was established in 1880. In 1939, federal jurisdiction for Indian peoples was interpreted by the courts to apply to the Inuit. A revised &quot;Indian Act&quot; was passed in 1951.

From 1950 to 1965, the Indian Affairs portfolio was carried by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. On October 1, 1966, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development was created as a result of the &quot;Government Organization Act, 1966&quot;. Effective June 13, 2011, the department began using the applied title Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada in addition to the legal name of the department.

====Northern Development====
The Northern Development part of the department has its origins in the Department of the Interior, a body created by then Prime Minister John A. Macdonald for the purpose of administering the &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; of 1872. When the Department of the Interior dissolved in 1936 (with the &quot;Natural Resources Act&quot;s transferring control over natural resources to the Prairie provinces), Indian Affairs fell under the purview of the Department of Mines and Resources. However, the need for social and health-care services in the North led to the establishment of the Northern Administration and Lands branch in 1951, which led to the creation of the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources in 1953. This became the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 1966. Under the Federal Identity Program, the department is known as Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada.

====Annual Arctic expeditions====
Beginning in the early 20th century, the Government of Canada sponsored annual expeditions to the Canadian North. These expeditions yielded extensive photographic documentation of the lives of northern indigenous peoples by participating explorers, engineers, scientists and medical staff.

Explorer, photographer, filmmaker, writer and lecturer Richard S. Finnie accompanied numerous expeditions to the North. His first voyage was aboard CGS &quot;Arctic&quot;, under the command of Captain Bernier in 1924. During the 1930–1931 expedition to the Western Arctic, Finnie served as filmmaker. Lachlan T. Burwash, an exploratory engineer with the Department of the Interior, made a survey of the east coasts of Hudson Bay and James Bay, and the Belcher Islands in the late 1920s.

Zoologist Joseph Dewey Soper travelled to the Baffin Island (Qikiqtaaluk) region in the late 1920s in order to document the landscape, as well as the plant and bird life. J.G. Wright, Superintendent of Eastern Arctic Patrol and National Film Board photographer, served on the 1945–1946 expedition sponsored by the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. As the Regional Director of Family Allowances for Yukon and the Northwest Territories, S.J. Bailey served as part of the Eastern Arctic Patrol beginning in the late 1940s.

=== Restructuring of the DIAND ===
In August 2017, the Trudeau ministry announced the dissolution of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) and announced that it would be replaced by the Department of Indigenous Services and the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada. This came into effect as of July 15, 2019. The transition was not instantaneous, with Orders-in-Council initially separating the portfolios, and formal legislation constituting the new departments being passed in July 2019.

According to Trudeau, the rationale behind the restructuring was that &quot;the structures in place at Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada were created at a time where the approach around the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, the approach around our engagement with indigenous peoples, was very much looked at in a paternalistic, colonial way&quot;. The new departments are consistent with the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples&#x27; recommendations to improve the delivery of services dramatically and fast-track self-government.

==Organization==
CIRNAC has offices in ten (10) regions, at headquarters and to deal with oil and gas leases. The offices are further divided into the broad divisions of treaties and aboriginal government; lands and economic development and education and social development. Northern Development is represented in only the Northwest Territories (NWT) and Nunavut (NU) regional offices and headquarters.

==&quot;The Nunavut Project&quot;==
The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement was implemented in 1993 between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and the Government of Canada subject to the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; of 1982. The territory of Nunavut was formed in 1999. CIRNAC has major responsibilities for managing the lands and resources of Nunavut.

With respect to the Inuit of Nunavut, the department and its Minister have the challenge of implementing the Conciliator&#x27;s Final Report, dated March 1, 2006 on the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Implementation Contract Negotiations for the Second Planning Period 2003-2013 &quot;The Nunavut Project&quot; authored by Thomas Berger. This report recommends an increase in Inuit participation in Nunavut&#x27;s federal and territorial public service.

<doc id="1193265" wikidata="Q923497" url="?curid=1193265" title="Walking with Cavemen">
<text>Walking with Cavemen is a 2003 four-part nature documentary television miniseries produced by the BBC Science Unit, the Discovery Channel and ProSieben. &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; explores human evolution, showcasing various extinct hominin species and their inferred behaviours and social dynamics. The original British version of the series is presented by the British researcher Robert Winston; in the American version Winston&#x27;s appearances and narration is replaced with narration by Alec Baldwin.

&quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; is the third instalment in the &quot;Walking with...&quot; series of documentaries, following on from &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; (1999) and &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot; (2001), and like its predecessors uses computer-generated imagery and animatronics, as well as live action footage shot at various locations, to reconstruct prehistoric life and environments. In order to ensure that &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; was consistent with scientific understanding of human evolution and that it portrayed the time periods and locations accurately, the production team employed a team of 111 scientists from various fields to advise on the series.

In addition to the techniques also used in previous series, &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; uses actors to portray extinct hominins since it was deemed impossible to evoke convincing human expressions and emotions using just computer graphics. The hominins in the series were portrayed by fourteen different actors wearing makeup and prosthetics. The series garnered a positive reception among both critics and scientists. Though there were concerns of conjecture being presented as fact, the series was praised for making the scientific theories concerning human evolution accessible to a wider audience. A companion book, &quot;Walking with Cavemen: Stand Eye-to-Eye with your Ancestors&quot;, was also released in 2003 and received positive reviews.

== Premise ==
&quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; follows the previous series &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; (1999) and &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot; (2001) in showcasing prehistoric life in a nature documentary style. Beginning in Ethiopia 3.2 million years ago, &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; follows the story of human evolution through exploring key developments on the path from &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; to modern humans. The programme often focuses on particular characters and their relationships to each other in order to be more accessible to viewers.

== Production ==
Partly due to some of the scientific criticism that had been levelled at previous instalments in the &quot;Walking with...&quot; franchise of documentaries, the production team of &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; recruited a large team of 111 scientists from various fields to advise on the series. The scientific team included experts on stone tools, geologists, primatologists, geneticists and climatologists, among others.

Like previous &quot;Walking with...&quot; series, &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; employed both computer graphics and animatronics to recreate prehistoric life. When possible, footage of actual live animals was used but other creatures, such as mammoths, had to be recreated through computer graphics. The visual effects were, as for previous series in the franchise, created by the visual effects company Framestore. &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; pioneered a new visual technique, the &quot;deep timelapse&quot;, in which scenes of climate, environmental and geological change spanning millions of years were put in a timelapse to only take a few moments.

The title &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; was settled upon during production. The title was chosen to appeal to the outdated stereotype of human ancestors being cave-dwellers (the programme does not portray hominins in caves until the last episode) in order to turn viewer&#x27;s expectations on their head and showcase that the past was not necessarily what they imagined it to be. It was determined to begin the series with &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;, at the time of production the best-documented early hominid. The behaviour of the &quot;Australopithecus&quot; portrayed in the series was modelled on chimpanzees and was particularly inspired by the chimpanzee research of Jane Goodall.

The BBC referred to &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; as one of its &quot;most ambitious TV science projects&quot;. In total, the series cost £4 million to make. It was the first instalment in the &quot;Walking with...&quot; franchise to not involve Tim Haines, the creator of the franchise. &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; was instead created by Richard Dale, who served as executive producer and director, and Peter Georgi, who served as series producer. Both Dale and Georgi had a background in documentary filmmaking and had, among other projects, previously worked together on the 2001 documentary film &quot;The Human Body&quot;.

=== Casting and hominin costumes ===

Although prehistoric animals had been created mostly through computer graphics in &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;Walking with Beasts&quot;, it was difficult to produce hominins through this method that were realistic in appearance, expression and movement. In particular no amount of computer graphics would have been able to convincingly portray emotions and allow audiences to determine how the hominins were feeling from looking in their eyes. Failure to convincingly portray human movement and expressions would have broken the &quot;magic&quot; &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; sought to create. As a result, the production team decided to use actors in makeup and prosthetics to portray human ancestors. Over 2,000 actors applied to join the series, out of which fourteen were selected. The fourteen actors had to spend five weeks with scientific experts as well as movement and voice coaches to recreate the early hominins. The complicated training programme was deemed to be necessary since an actor acting in the wrong way would easily have broken the illusion of the programme.

Using actors presented a challenge since special effects had to be employed to change the look of both their faces and their bodies to match the appearance of the hominins they were portraying. The costumes were created using the best available scientific evidence. A massive amount of prosthetics, well over 1,500 pieces, were created and used during filming alongside other components and animatronics. The makeup effects were created by David White and Sacha Carter (Altered States FX) and the prosthetics were created by numerous artists, including Nik Williams, Matthew Smith (Animated Extras) and Barrie Gower (BGFX). The makeup process for the actors took five hours every morning of filming and some of the costumes made it difficult to perform tasks unrelated to the programme; actors in &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot; costumes for instance found it difficult to eat their lunch and drinking was a problem in most of the costumes. Many actors used straws for all drinks.

During promotion of the series, the BBC did a publicity photoshoot with the actors David Rubin and Suzanne Cave, who among other roles portrayed elder male and female &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;, respectively.

Like &quot;The Giant Claw&quot; (2002) and &quot;Land of Giants&quot; (2003), special episodes of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; includes a presenter rather than simply a narrator. The series is presented by the British researcher Robert Winston, who had previously hosted other BBC series on humans, such as &quot;Your Life in Their Hands&quot; (1979–1987), &quot;The Human Body&quot; (1998) and &quot;Child of Our Time&quot; (2000–2020). The American version of the programme replaced Winston&#x27;s narration and appearances and was originally going to be hosted by Nigel Marven, who previously appeared in episodes of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; and in the series &quot;Sea Monsters&quot;, but the production team eventually instead created a version hosted by the actor Alec Baldwin. The Alec Baldwin-hosted edit is a two-part special, each part approximately 50 minutes in length. Another two-part edit of &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot;, available on some DVD releases, is narrated by British actor Andrew Sachs, who does not appear on camera.

=== Filming ===
Most of the footage of &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; was shot on location. The series was filmed over 41 days. The vast majority of the filming days, 29 days, were spent in South Africa; the other locations were Iceland (four days), Yorkshire (two days), Tunbridge Wells (one day) and the studio (five days). These locations in turn often included separate locations were up to four different units shot footage at the same time. In South Africa, &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; footage was filmed in the Southern Kalahari Desert, the Augrabies Falls National Park and the Orange River regions.

Filming in the Southern Kalahari Desert proved problematic for the actors, since temperatures could reach 30/40 °C (86/104 °F) and they wore full makeup and bodysuits. The team was as a result constantly accompanied by medical professionals who provided the actors with rehydrating solutions and salts.

=== Scientific and critical response ===
The British anthropologist Clive Gamble gave &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; a positive review in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;. Though finding several details questionable, such as Neanderthals being described as lacking imagination and not wearing boots, &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; not being black-skinned, and monogamy being showcased as a norm rather than a more recent concept, Gamble also felt that such criticisms missed the point of the programme. Gamble concluded that the point of the series was to introduce a wider audience to the scientific understanding of human evolution through keeping drama rather than scientific debate as the driving force and that the series had succeeded in this purpose. Gamble also enjoyed the inclusion of Robert Winston as presenter, referring to him as a &quot;Dr Who of human evolution&quot; who travelled through time and offered factoids and insight.

Writing for the Archaeological Institute of America, the British archaeologist Paul Bahn also gave the series a positive review, praising the workmanship that went into creating the costumes and calling the landscapes featured &quot;spectacular&quot;. Bahn noted that most of what is shown in the series is pure speculation but considered &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; to be &quot;well worth a look&quot; and particularly praised how it made humanity&#x27;s long dead ancestors feel &quot;more real and alive&quot;.

Lynne Heffley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also praised &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot;, calling it a &quot;fascinating exploration of human evolution&quot;. Heffley noted that the narrative at times grew &quot;a tad overheated&quot; and that &quot;stiftly moving mouths&quot; could detract from the otherwise excellent prosthetics but still considered the series an impressive effort &quot;well worth the trip&quot;. The Australia-based British broadcaster Alan Saunders criticized the series for various events throughout being referred to as milestones on the path to &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, which Saunders interpreted as veering close to suggesting that evolution was a process that would inevitably have led to modern humans.

=== Popular response ===
In 2003, BBC News hosted a debate section where viewers could share their views on &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot;, which attracted both positive and negative user responses. The negative user responses outweighed the positive ones, with some users being concerned that much of the programme appeared to be conjecture and that Robert Winston, or the programme as a whole, were dumbing down the science or &quot;patronising&quot; viewers. Some viewers found the hominin suits to be unconvincing and drew unfavourable comparisons to the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; films. Several users also criticized the programme for presenting evolution as fact instead of considering the (pseudoscientific) idea of intelligent design. In an interview, Robert Winston dismissed fears of dumbing down the science, stating that &quot;We are making it exciting, we are bringing science alive, and I absolutely disagree with the notion of dumbing down.&quot; Positive user responses mentioned that the programme made otherwise obscure science more accessible to the masses and praised the series combining a scientific and humanistic approach. Some users also praised the effects, including the hominin costumes, and the writing.

== In other media ==

=== Companion book ===
A companion book to the series, titled &quot;Walking with Cavemen: Stand Eye-to-Eye with your Ancestors&quot;, was co-authored by the photographer (and executive editor on the series) John Lynch and the professor of psychology and human evolution researcher Louise Barrett. The book is a coffee-table book which explores mankind&#x27;s origins in a similar vein as the series, mixing imagined anecdotes and scientific fact together and using stills from the series to bring the ancient hominins to life. The book was reviewed positively in the book review magazine &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, which considered the book to have been &quot;competently executed&quot;.

=== Interactive version ===
Using BBCi (BBC Interative Television), viewers could during the programme&#x27;s original airing watch &quot;Walking with Cavemen&quot; with additional layers of factual evidence, such as facts about fossils and comprehensive summaries of the science behind every episode. After every episode, the evidence shown would be drawn together into a 10-minute exclusive extra documentary.

=== Website ===
An accompanying website to the series was launched in 2003, intended to act as a &quot;stand-alone resource in its own right&quot;. The website included fact files on every hominin, family trees, summaries of the episodes, behind-the-scenes information and a flash game, &quot;Ape to Man&quot;, in which players played through seven tasks, each representing a milestone in human evolution.

<doc id="1193269" wikidata="Q7450478" url="?curid=1193269" title="Senegalese hip-hop">
<text>Senegalese hip hop is a form of hip hop that originated in Senegal in the early 1980s. When hip hop first hit the scene in Africa, it went from merely being a fad, to a more social and political movement. Amongst the most influential leaders of this movement were artists from the country of Senegal. With the modernization of the country, and the rise in media, the youth of Senegal were able to embrace a new form of expression.

One of the main reasons why hip hop has become preeminent in Senegal is due to its mixture of sound and culture. &quot;Senegal&#x27;s hip hop scene is distinctive and its artist extremely talented. The country has a history of strong musical traditions...&quot; Moreover, hip hop has not only become an aspect of life for the Senegalese people, but more importantly has translated to a way of life, gathering influence from the musical expression prior to its rise in Senegal, and understanding their past as it pertains heavily to its socially present state within music.

==Colonization of Senegal==

To understand Senegal&#x27;s popularity as a mixture of different sounds is understanding Senegal&#x27;s history of colonization. Modern Senegal is made up of an ethnically diverse group of people. &quot;The largest of the city include the Wolof (44% of the population), Fulani and Tukulor (24%), Serer (15%), Diola (5%) and, Mandinka (4%).&quot; During the 9th century the Tukulor settled in the Senegal River Valley and resided there until the 14th century. Within their rein, into the mid 11th century they converted to Islam. The Mali Empire expanded during the 14th century, and in the 15th century, the Wolf established the Jolof Empire in Senegal. The Portuguese settlers set up trading spaces for access to resources, but by the 17th century, the city was rid of the Portuguese by the Dutch and the French. The French resided there until 1895 when Senegal was established as a French colony.

In the early 1960s Senegal became an autonomous republic within the French community. Hence forward, the estate went through several forms of political oppression and reconstruction until finally Abdoulaye Wade was elected president in March 2000 and the Senegalese Democratic Party had finally won, bringing peace and improvement to the land. &quot;The development of modern music dates back to the musical traditions established by &#x27;griots&#x27; in the days of the Mali-Songhay empires.&quot; It can be noted that the first form of musical expression made in Senegal date back to the 14th century in the forms of griots.

==History of griots==
Prior to the wide spread of hip hop in Senegal, traditional music was transcended through pre-ordained griots. The term griot, also known as gewel, can be defined as, &quot;… traditional praise-singer, musician, social go-between, counselors, or dancer and acrobat,&quot; These individuals were born into, &quot;endogamous, professionally specialized group often referred to as a &#x27;caste&#x27;.&quot; Their position in Senegal society was that of much importance for griots were also known for their abilities as oral specialist who, &quot;…had to guarantee not only the survival of their people as a culturally and historically defined group, but also the social status of the nobles they were attached to.&quot;

Griots were culturally responsible for knowing their genealogies in speaking and in song, to recite for the nobles. Though they were not considered &quot;upper-class&quot;, they were given food, clothing, jewellery, land and slaves for their work.&quot; While they could attain high individual status through their work and their social behaviors, their social status as a group was low. They depended economically on the nobles who paid them for their services, they could not attain positions of political power, and they were not allowed to bear arms…&quot; Understanding their role in society is understanding the importance of expression in Senegal. As historians, entertainers, and musicians, griots were influential in many ceremonies, such as weddings, funerals, births, religious parades, and politics, for they used song and speech to recite important information with the usage of praise songs.

==Praise song==
These praise songs continue to be widely sung, and often express political and religious awareness. Below is an example of a praise song with both political and historical meaning song by a modern-day female artist, Khar M&#x27;Baye Maadiaga from the gewel background.
&lt;poem&gt;
Democracy, democracy,
yes, yes, democracy.
Yes, yes the country wonders
What did you go through, for the land to become meek?

Yes, you went the [right] way, Diouf;
he passed through deliberation,
and by speaking at the right moment. 
Yes. What makes a man is courage and seriousness.

Seventeen parties, all in a jumble.
They are shouting, but you keep your dignity.
They are shouting, but you keep your calmness.
It is by calmness that you can rule a country.
But those who came to you also have their merit.
They too hold their country in esteem.
As far as democracy is concerned, Senegal is a model country.

Mbagnik Yacine Baba
Massine Yancie Baba
Caroline Yacine Baba…
Oh Abdou… Madiatou Badara and Mawado
Ndiaye Diouf your father at Guet-Ndar.
So, Elisabeth, 
a good wife has to be like you: 

&lt;/poem&gt;

==Modern griots and modern music==
After World War II, there was a rise in the night club scene where more diverse forms of music began to be played by foreigners. Coincidentally enough, Senegal became very much interested in the new form of fashion. However, this allowed non-griots the opportunity to capture persons which was once the job of the griots. While there was much competition between the two, modern day griots used their positions as a way to incorporate modern day music.

While in modern-day Senegal, griots can be placed in three categories. &quot;Those who have decided to refrain from practicing their hereditary profession and have taken up some other occupation; those who continue to perform, without innovation, and those who have managed to find or create a new kind of occupation that still seems to fit the traditional griots&#x27; ethos adapting the art of their ancestors to modern requirements and possibilities.&quot; The griot&#x27;s position in society, most relevant to modern day music, are those who use their song and dance as a new kind of occupation while still practicing the traditional legacies of past griots. These individuals are still highly respected for their responsibilities, and have also become incorporated in popular music culture. &quot;Praise songs, far from being superseded, have instead become incorporated into popular music...&quot; Today, &quot;griots have found new meaning for old customs, and new functions for old skills,&quot; Although they originated from a caste which held no political power, modern griots still hold much power and status and are better off in life than modern families.

== Rappers as &quot;modern-day griots&quot; ==
As detailed in Patricia Tang&#x27;s article &quot;The Rapper as Modern Griot: Reclaiming Ancient Traditions&quot;, over the years, both Senegalese and American rappers have labeled themselves &quot;modern-day griots&quot;. Many disagree with this assertion because there is such a great contrast between griots and rappers, and the roles they play within society. Griots are musicians or entertainers hired by royalty, or the upper-class, to songs of praise. The subject matter of these songs usually consists of admiration for nobles, but can also include commentary on social issues. However, according to Tang, &quot;although these songs sometimes have moral or didactic messages regarding social behavior, they rarely speak out against specific individuals or institutions.&quot; Contrastingly, rappers do not sing praise songs for the upper-class, and they do not sing for money; though they are paid artists, rappers perform their music to convey an important message or because it is their passion. More significantly, rappers, especially those in Senegal, &quot;openly critique politicians and the government.&quot; Their songs address important societal issues, spread awareness, and &quot;demand and effect change.&quot;

Yet, aside from all these differences, there are specific reasons why rappers today call themselves &quot;modern-day griots&quot;. According to rapper, Awadi, this designation of &quot;modern-day griots&quot; is for one reason only: &quot;what we rappers have continued to do, what we have taken from the griots, is from the journalistic side. A journalist engaged in his society.&quot; But at the same time, being labeled a griot has other connotations, and it all boils down to musical &quot;authenticity&quot;. Griots come from long lineages of griots, the role of griot being passed down generation to generation. Griots thus have history, and this lineage, this great past, is connected with the idea of authenticity, therefore, when rappers assume the name &quot;modern-day griot&quot;, they are given part of that history, and their art forms then become more &quot;authentic&quot;. For U.S. rappers, it takes a step further because not only are they connecting themselves to the &quot;authenticity&quot; of griots, they are also becoming a part of the history of Africa, which has a much greater cultural history and thus an even greater form of authenticity. For rappers, history has become a legitimizing force, but such a focus on the past also has its consequences. Though giving historical prestige to rappers today, by romanticizing Africa in this way, giving so much emphasis on its history, has placed the continent in the past, almost ignoring its contemporary musical growth.

What sets aside the music of Senegal apart from many other place is its use of instruments. The most widely used instrument that the Senegalese use is the drum. Also, of importance is the language that these artists rap and sing in. Being that Senegal was colonized by the French is why we see some people develop their sound and rap entirely in French. Others choose to rap in Wolof, or English. &quot;Wolof is the most widely spoken language of northern Senegal and it has rich and ancient musical culture performed by hereditary musicians (gewel).&quot; Not to mention the fact that there sound is a collection from previous cultures and music styles infused in the Hip Hop culture. These are just some of the features you will only find in Senegalese Hip Hop.

===Underground hip hop===
Of relevance is the powerful underground hip hop that takes place in Senegal. &quot;While mainstream artist address important social and political issues, it is the underground rap artists in Senegal that go the furthest. Some have even addressed the taboo subject of the country&#x27;s marabouts* and the power and political influence they hold in the country.&quot; Now while it may take more time for this artist to be heard by everyone, their music still holds much influential power as these artist take political stances and addresses the issue they are facing. Discouraging enough, though Senegal can be praised for its ecstatic hip hop scene, sadly enough the solo female artist has no place in Hip Hop in Senegal. Though there are a number of female artists within the mbalax music scene, these women are generally a part of a group, and to this day there has not been a release of a solo female rap album. &quot;The only female rap artist to have made an impact on the Senegelese rap scene is ALIF, the country&#x27;s first all-female rap group.&quot; With the strides Senegal is making as a modernized country, only time will tell before the first female solo album is released and praised for its political context, and social advocating for change.

===Social change through music===
It was started by Baay Bia who spent more than 10 years using his talent to make people aware about protecting the Senegalese environment. Senegalese hip hop is all about education. Some Senegalese artists use their fame as ways to bring empowerment and social change to the continent of Africa. Senegalese singer-guitarist Baaba Maal is highly acclaimed for his music stardom on a global level, however his contributions as youth emissary for the United Nations has earned him more acclaim in the pursuit for social justice. &quot;For Maal, the solution isn&#x27;t throwing money at the crises, it is holding governments accountable.&quot; Maal knows the ample amount of resources and technology here in America and feels that if we could just spot light these areas, then maybe governments would straighten up.

There is a solo female artist who had released an album, her name is Sister Fa, but that album did not have so much effect in Senegalese Hip Hop market. She was also the wife of Studio Yes&#x27; owner. She is living now in Germany and is about to come back to release her second album.

<text>The Agron () was Saadia Gaon&#x27;s first work, completed in 913CE, when he was 20 years old. The book is also known by its Judeo-Arabic name &quot;The Rudiments of Hebrew Poetry&quot;. &quot;The Agron&quot; is not a Hebrew language dictionary; it does not define the different meanings of words or radicals. Instead, it is a lexicographical reference book for payṭanim, which includes in its first section words arranged alphabetically by first letter for use in making acrostics at the beginning of the poetic line; in the second section are words arranged alphabetically by last letter (syllable), for use in making rhymes at the end of the poetic line. The work consisted of two parts and was intended to be used in versification, in which acrostics and rhyme were the chief requisites. In a later edition, Saadia added the Arabic translation of each word, and also included passages concerning various &quot;memorable subjects of the poets,&quot; and named the work in its new form &quot;&quot;Kitab al-Shi&#x27;r&quot;.&quot; The Arabic introduction to the second edition and the Hebrew preface of the first have been in great part preserved. Saadia&#x27;s &quot;The Agron&quot; is considered a dictionary because in his preface he described himself and his work as the &quot;collector&quot; and collection of the Hebrew language.

The word &quot;agron&quot;, as entered Hebrew to refer to thesaurus texts which also define words for practical use. A 2006 lookup database which distributed personal details of millions of Israelis stolen from government records was also called .

<doc id="1193286" wikidata="Q57355" url="?curid=1193286" title="Georg Friedrich Prinz von Preussen">
<text>Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (born 10 June 1976, as &quot;Georg Friedrich Ferdinand Prinz von Preußen&quot;) is a German heir who is the current head of the Prussian branch of the House of Hohenzollern, the former ruling dynasty of the German Empire and of the Kingdom of Prussia. He is the great-great-grandson of Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor and King of Prussia, who abdicated and went into exile upon Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I in 1918. 

He is known to the German public mostly due to his claims against the German State to return former possessions to his family. 

==Education and career==
Georg Friedrich is the only son and eldest child of Louis Ferdinand Prinz von Preussen (1944–1977) and Countess Donata of Castell-Rüdenhausen (1950–2015). Born into a mediatised princely family, his mother later became Duchess Donata of Oldenburg when she married secondly Duke Friedrich August of Oldenburg, who had previously been married to her sister-in-law Princess Marie Cécile of Prussia. His only sister is Cornelie-Cécile (b. 1978).

He attended grammar schools in Bremen and Oldenburg and completed his education at Glenalmond College near Perth, Scotland, where he passed his A-levels. He then served for a two-year commission in the Alpine troops of the and was discharged after his term of service. Georg Friedrich earned his degree in business economics at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology.

Georg Friedrich works for a company specialising in helping universities to bring their innovations to market. He also administered the Princess Kira of Prussia Foundation, founded by his grandmother Grand Duchess Kira of Russia in 1952, now administered by his wife. In 2018 he moved from a house near Bremen, where he had also spent his childhood, to Babelsberg, a district of Potsdam, the capital city of the German state of Brandenburg.

He owns a two-thirds share of his family&#x27;s original seat, Hohenzollern Castle, while the other share is held by the head of the Swabian branch, Karl Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern. He also owns the Princes&#x27; Island in the Great Lake of . In 2017 he founded a beer trademark called (Royal Prussian Beer Manufactory) producing a Pilsner brand called .

Georg Friedrich continues to claim compensation for land and palaces in Berlin expropriated from his family, a claim begun in March 1991 by his grandfather Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia under the Compensation Act (EALG).

==House of Hohenzollern==

Georg Friedrich succeeded his grandfather, Louis Ferdinand, as Head of the Royal House of Prussia, a branch of the House of Hohenzollern, on 26 September 1994. He stated that he learned to appreciate the history and responsibility of his heritage during time spent with his paternal grandfather, who often recounted to him anecdotes from the life in exile of his own grandfather, the last German Kaiser, Wilhelm II.

His position as sole heir to the estate of his grandfather was challenged by his uncles, Friedrich Wilhelm and Michael, who filed a lawsuit claiming that, despite their renunciations as dynasts at the time of their marriages, the loss of their inheritance rights based on their selection of spouse was discriminatory and unconstitutional. His uncles were initially successful, the Regional Court of Hechingen and the higher Regional Court of Stuttgart ruling in their favour in 1997 on the grounds that the requirement to marry equally was &quot;immoral&quot;. However, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany overturned the original rulings in favour of Georg Friedrich&#x27;s uncles, the case being remanded to the courts at Hechingen and Stuttgart. This time both courts ruled in favour of Georg Friedrich. His uncles then took their case to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany which overruled the previous court rulings in Georg Friedrich&#x27;s favour, on 22 March 2004. On 19 October 2005, a German regional court ruled that Georg Friedrich was indeed the principal heir of his grandfather, Louis Ferdinand (who was the primary beneficiary of the trust set up for the estate of Wilhelm II), but also concluded that each of the children of Louis Ferdinand was entitled to a portion of the Prussian inheritance.

==Family==

In 2011, Georg Friedrich married Princess Sophie of Isenburg. The civil wedding took place in Potsdam on 25 August 2011, and the ecumenical religious wedding took place at the Church of Peace in Potsdam on 27 August 2011, in commemoration of the 950th anniversary of the founding of the House of Hohenzollern. The religious wedding was also broadcast live by local public television. 

On 20 January 2013, Georg Friedrich&#x27;s wife, Sophie, gave birth to twin sons in Bremen, Carl Friedrich Franz Alexander and Louis Ferdinand Christian Albrecht. Carl Friedrich, the elder of the two, is his father&#x27;s heir apparent. Their third child, Emma Marie Charlotte Sophie, was born on 2 April 2015. On 17 November 2016, Sophie gave birth to Heinrich Albert Johann Georg, their fourth child.

== Property claims ==
In mid-2019 it was revealed that, since 2014, Georg Friedrich had filed claims for permanent right of residency for his family in Cecilienhof, or one of two other former Hohenzollern palaces in Potsdam, as well as return of the family library, 266 paintings, an imperial crown and sceptre, and the letters of Empress Augusta Victoria. This sparked a public debate about the legitimacy of these claims and the role of the Hohenzollern during and before the Nazi regime in Germany, specifically Crown Prince Wilhelm&#x27;s involvement. On 9 March 2023, Georg Friedrich dropped the suit, hoping that doing so would &quot;open the way for an unencumbered historical debate on the role of my family in the 20th Century following the end of the monarchy.&quot;

In June 2019, a claim made by Georg Friedrich that Rheinfels Castle be returned to the Hohenzollern family was dismissed by a court. In 1924, the ruined castle had been given to the town of St Goar, under the &quot;proviso&quot; (the conditional provision to an agreement) it was not sold. In 1998 the town leased the ruins to a nearby hotel. His case made the claim that this constituted a breach of the bequest.

<text>Allan Guy Hamilton (born August 20, 1946) is a Canadian former ice hockey defenceman, most notably with the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association. He also played in the National Hockey League for the Oilers, as well as the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres.

==Playing career==
Signed by the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) as a teenager, Hamilton spent his junior career with the Edmonton Oil Kings. He met with great success in juniors, being one of the rare players to play in the Memorial Cup tournament for three consecutive years. His final season in 1966 with the Oil Kings saw the team win the Memorial Cup, led by Hamilton&#x27;s remarkable 82 points in 55 regular season and playoff games, drawing frequent comparisons with his junior contemporary Bobby Orr of the Oshawa Generals. In fact in Hamilton&#x27;s Memorial Cup-winning final junior year, Hamilton and Orr highlighted the championship game by trading end-to-end rushes.

Hamilton made a rather auspicious debut with the Rangers on a Wednesday night hockey broadcast. As Frank Mahovlich was skating down the boards, Hamilton entered the playing surface from the bench on a line change and knocked out the unsuspecting Mahovlich with a thundering shoulder check that required smelling salts to help him retain consciousness.. While he played a few games for the Rangers in 1966, he toiled for the next three seasons in the minors, winning all-star accolades for the Omaha Knights of the Central Hockey League in 1967 and spending the two years thereafter with the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League. Hamilton finally cracked the Rangers&#x27; lineup in 1969, playing in 59 games, but he had arrived at a time when the Ranger defence was stacked and a new kid named Brad Park was turning heads. Hamilton was left unprotected for the 1970 NHL Expansion Draft and was selected by the Buffalo Sabres as their third choice.

However, when the World Hockey Association began in 1972, Hamilton jumped over to the fledgling league, signing with the Alberta Oilers for their first season. Named the team&#x27;s captain at the age of 26, he immediately responded with a 61-point season, his best as a pro, A superb defender and leader, he captained the Oilers for four seasons and was chosen to represent Canada in the 1974 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. Overcoming injuries that frequently struck—and which cost him most of the 1975 season—Hamilton remained the leader of the Oilers&#x27; defence corps for the whole of the WHA&#x27;s history. When the Oilers joined the NHL for the 1979–80 NHL season, Hamilton had set the record for most games played (455) and most points scored (311) by any player while a WHA Oiler.

==Retirement==
Hamilton finished his career back in the NHL, playing 31 games with the Edmonton Oilers in 1979–80; however, beset by a lingering eye injury from the previous season, he retired at season&#x27;s end. His number &quot;3&quot; was the first retired by the franchise. As of 2024, Hamilton is the only Oiler not to be a member of the 1980s Stanley Cup teams to have his number retired.

For the WHA all-time, he is 13th in games played, 15th in assists, 40th in points, and 38th in penalty minutes. He was also the franchise leader for the WHA Oilers in games, assists, and points, and second in penalty minutes.

Hamilton remains active with the Oiler alumni and community affairs in the Edmonton area.

==Family==
His son, Steve Hamilton (born 1973) is the current head coach with the Everett Silvertips of the Western Hockey League.

At the age of 63 she returned to the same role when the play was revived at the West End&#x27;s Savoy Theatre in 2004.

==Career==
One of Cole&#x27;s most recognised and popular roles was of Dr Beatrice (Bea) Mason in the 1980s television series &quot;Tenko&quot;, a drama which chronicled the lives of British women in Singapore after the Japanese invasion and their consequent confinement in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. The starkly realistic series was explicit in its portrayal of the horrific conditions and brutality faced by the women during their imprisonment, and dealt with issues such as rape, stillbirth, lesbianism, suicide, abortion and euthanasia. Cole played the role of the stern, officious yet kindly doctor over three series and a one-off special between 1981 and 1985.

During this same period, Cole also played the elderly, paranoid and morose customer Mrs Delphine Featherstone, nicknamed &quot;The Black Widow&quot;, in the BBC comedy &quot;Open All Hours&quot;. Mrs Featherstone was the only rival to Nurse Gladys Emmanuel for the affections of shopkeeper Arkwright, played by Ronnie Barker (who had recommended her to play the part after seeing her in &quot;Tenko&quot;), although she was attracted to him only because she liked his stingy ways. Arkwright was scared of her advances and often hid when he saw her approaching the shop. Cole was actually only in her early forties when she took the role; playing characters much older than she actually was (notably in &quot;Waiting for God&quot;) became a hallmark of her career. She also appeared in a single episode of Fresh Fields as dog-trainer Mrs Robertson (1986).

In 1988, Cole joined actresses Thora Hird, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters and Patricia Routledge in the award-winning first series of &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, featuring dramatic monologues written for BBC Television by British playwright Alan Bennett. Cole performed the role of Muriel to great acclaim during the half-hour monologue &quot;Soldiering On&quot;. In later years, Cole would repeat her performance of this now famous monologue on both the London stage and for BBC Radio.

Cole played bad-tempered retired photojournalist Diana Trent in the sitcom &quot;Waiting for God&quot;, which ran from 1990 to 1994. Although Diana was supposed to be a pensioner, Cole was actually 48 years old when she took the role, for which she received the 1992 Best TV Comedy Actress award at the British Comedy Awards.

From 2004 to 2009, Cole appeared with Martin Clunes and Caroline Catz in the ITV comedy-drama, &quot;Doc Martin&quot; as Joan Norton, aunt of Clunes&#x27; character Dr Martin Ellingham. In 2006, Cole starred with Victoria Wood in the BAFTA award-winning World War II drama &quot;Housewife, 49&quot; as Mrs Waite, the local head of what was then the WVS. Cole also had a small role in the 2008 romantic comedy &quot;Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day&quot; as Miss Pettigrew&#x27;s grumpy boss, Miss Holt.

In April 2011, Cole joined the cast of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, playing Sylvia Goodwin, the mother of regular character Roy Cropper. In August 2012, she was cast in an adaptation of the 1938 thriller film &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; on the BBC.

In August 2013, it was announced that Cole had left &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, just episodes after her onscreen daughter-in-law had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. It was initially speculated that her sudden departure was due to illness but Cole later confirmed on Twitter that her already pending departure had been brought forward due to her brother&#x27;s death.

From 2013 to 2019, Cole reprised her role as Delphine Featherstone in &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;. She appeared with original actors David Jason, Lynda Baron and Maggie Ollerenshaw.

On Halloween 2018, Stephanie guest starred in the live episode of &quot;Inside No 9&quot; entitled &#x27;Dead Line&#x27;, she played the role of Moira O&#x27;Keefe. The episode received critical praise citing it as one of the best bits of television of 2018.

In 2019 Cole appeared in the BBC One comedy &quot;Scarborough&quot;.

===Stage===
Cole has also performed as a stage actress for more than fifty years. On the West End stage, she has featured in &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; in 1968 (Ambassadors Theatre) as Miss Casewell, &quot;Noises Off&quot; in 1983 (Savoy Theatre), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; in 1989 (Lyric Theatre) and &quot;Quartet&quot; in 1999 (Albery Theatre). Her most prominent stage role was as Betty in the hit comedy &quot;A Passionate Woman&quot; written by Kay Mellor. The play, directed by Ned Sherrin, opened at the Comedy Theatre in 1994 and had a nine-month extended run. On the West End&#x27;s production&#x27;s last curtain call, Cole was made the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. 

===Radio===
Cole has appeared in several radio series. She starred in the BBC Radio 4 comedy, &quot;Ed Reardon&#x27;s Week&quot; as Olive, a student in Ed&#x27;s writing class. Other work for BBC Radio 4 includes the role of Carolyn Knapp-Shappey, opposite Benedict Cumberbatch and Roger Allam in the successful airline sitcom &quot;Cabin Pressure&quot;, written by, and also featuring, John Finnemore. She also played opposite Hugh Bonneville in the Sci-fi comedy &quot;Married&quot;. and, in 2017, starred as Queen Victoria in an episode of &quot;John Finnemore&#x27;s Double Acts&quot; on Radio 4.

===Other===
In 1998, Cole&#x27;s career in comedy was commemorated in the BBC documentary series &quot;Funny Women&quot;. In the same year, Cole&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Passionate Life&quot; was published. The book&#x27;s foreword was written by British theatre director Ned Sherrin.

==Honours==
In 2002, Cole was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of Bristol. In 2005, she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List for her services to drama, the elderly and mental health charities.

Cole was voted Solihull&#x27;s favourite Silhillian in a competition run by Solihull Council in December 2006. She beat Lucy Davis, Martin Johnson and Richard Hammond to pick up the top crown in &quot;The S Factor&quot;.

==Charity work==
Cole is an Ambassador for the medical charity Overseas Plastic Surgery Appeal.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Cole married fight director Henry Marshall, who was one of the founders of the British Academy of Dramatic Combat and was a Master at Arms at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. They have a daughter, Emma Battcock (born 1973). They divorced in 1988. In 1998, Cole married fellow actor Peter Birrel after meeting him again, thirty years after they first appeared together in a production of &quot;Richard II&quot; at the Bristol Old Vic.

<doc id="1193292" wikidata="Q839205" url="?curid=1193292" title="National Labor Party">
<text>The National Labor Party was formed by Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes in 1916, following the 1916 Labor split on the issue of World War I conscription in Australia. Hughes had taken over as leader of the Australian Labor Party and Prime Minister of Australia when anti-conscriptionist Andrew Fisher resigned in 1915. He formed the new party for himself and his followers after he was expelled from the ALP a month after the 1916 plebiscite on conscription in Australia. Hughes held a pro-conscription stance in relation to World War I.

==Formation==
On 15 September 1916, the executive of the Political Labour League (the Labor Party organisation in New South Wales at the time) expelled Hughes from the Labor Party.

When the Federal Parliamentary Labor caucus met on 14 November 1916, lengthy discussions ensued until Hughes walked out with 24 other Labor members; the remaining 43 members of Caucus then passed their motion of no confidence in the leadership, effectively expelling Hughes and the other members.

Hughes and his followers, who included several early Labor leaders, formed a minority government supported by the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by another Labor dissident, Joseph Cook. Believing the Labor Party was no longer sufficiently nationalist, they began laying the groundwork for a new party that would be both socially radical and nationalist.

In 1917, Hughes and Cook turned their confidence-and-supply agreement into a formal party, the Nationalist Party of Australia. Hughes became the merged party&#x27;s leader, with Cook as his deputy. Although it was essentially an upper- and middle-class party dominated by former Liberals, the presence of several Labor men allowed the party to project an image of national unity.

The National Labor Party was never formally constituted itself as a party and had no organisational structure, although some trade union officials and Labor Party branches, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, supported it.

==Queensland==

The Labor Party avoided a split in Queensland due to the efforts of T. J. Ryan to minimise losses. Only one member of the state parliament, John Adamson, left the party and initially there was no attempt to create an alternate vehicle at the state level. However in October 1919, Adamson was part of the formation of a party for ex-Labor supporters that used the name. It had no electoral success and soon disappeared.

==Western Australia==
The National Labor movement in Western Australia started off as two separate groups—one known as the Labor Solidarity Committee based out of Trades Hall in Perth, and the other known as National Labor and based on the goldfields. The two merged in April–May 1917, with former premier John Scaddan as their leader. However, by July he was without a seat in Parliament, and the party turned to Federal Senators Patrick Lynch, Hugh de Largie and George Pearce for leadership and guidance. Unlike its federal counterpart, it maintained its own distinct identity and structure and worked with the Nationalists as coalition partners. A number of Western Australian unions disaffiliated from the Australian Labor Federation to support the National Labor movement—most notably those representing the engine-drivers, railway employees, boilermakers and carpenters which were powerful in the goldfields. Organisationally, however, the party was believed to be over-dependent on its Senate patrons and struggled to build a genuine extraparliamentary organisation.

The party scored six of 50 Legislative Assembly seats in each of the 1917 and 1921 elections, and held three of 30 Council seats during this period. However, in the 1924 elections, their representation was reduced to one in the Legislative Assembly and two in the Legislative Council — many through the defeat of sitting NLP members by Labor candidates. Later that year, what remained of the party was subsumed by the Nationalists.

<doc id="1193299" wikidata="Q2599903" url="?curid=1193299" title="Rocket jumping">
<text>In shooter games, rocket jumping is the technique of using the knockback of an explosive weapon, most often a rocket launcher, to launch the shooter into the air. The aim of this technique is to reach heights, distances and speed that standard character movement cannot achieve. Although the origin of rocket jumping is unclear, its usage was popularized by &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress 2.&quot;

Rocket jumping is used often in competitive play, where it can allow the player to gain quick bursts of speed, reach normally unobtainable heights, secure positional advantages, or in speedrunning. However, a potential consequence of rocket jumping is that it can injure the player, either from the blast or from fall damage. This effect makes the technique less useful in games where the damage from the blast and/or fall is high, or where health is difficult to replenish (such as in &quot;Half-Life&quot;, where rocket jumps leave the player with approximately 10 health).

==In the &quot;Quake&quot; series==
While using explosives to propel oneself was first seen in &quot;Doom&quot;, the modern technique became a core mechanic in &quot;Quake&quot;. By exploiting the physics of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, many advanced movement techniques were spawned such as circle jumping, strafing, bunny hopping, and explosive jumping. Rocket jumping was kept as an intentional mechanic for the leading games in the &quot;Quake series.&quot; In &quot;Quake III: Arena&quot; some of the computer-controlled opponents use rocket jumps.

==Forms==
Rocket jumping has appeared in several games in a variety of forms, sometimes as a form of emergent gameplay.

===Horizontal===
A horizontal form of rocket jumping appears in &quot;Doom&quot; (1993), where it is used to reach the secret exit in E3M6.

===Vertical===
The first games to feature vertical rocket jumping were Bungie&#x27;s &quot;Marathon&quot; and 3D Realms&#x27; &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, which were both released on the same day. It was featured the same year on The Outfoxies. Rocket jumping became very popular in the original &quot;Quake&quot; (1996), and was used as an advanced technique for deathmatch play as well as for the Quake done Quick series.

In the game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; (2007), the Soldier class can use his rockets to rocket jump. This is an intentional feature with several mechanics associated with it. The game features numerous unlockable weapons with attributes that only affect rocket jumping or only apply while rocket jumping. The Demoman class can achieve a similar effect using his own assortment of explosive weapons, such as the &quot;Stickybomb Launcher&quot;, or by crouching and jumping with his &quot;Ullapool Caber&quot; melee weapon. It is also possible to use knockback provided by enemy explosives to perform a similarly boosted jump as any class.

In &quot;Minecraft&quot; (2011), the player can activate TNT in order to propel themselves. While it is usually fatal when attempted, equipping armour can allow players to survive the blast damage, enabling it to be used as a form of transportation. It can also be attempted with creepers, in-game entities that explode upon close contact.

In &quot;Overwatch&quot; (2016), multiple characters have explosive projectiles that can be used to rocket jump.

===Other variations===
*A similar technique can often be performed with other explosives, such as grenades, remotely detonated bombs or explosive objects in the level; depending on the game, these might be more, equally or less viable alternatives to rocket jumps.
*Some games offer weapons that knock the user back with their recoil. In the &quot;Unreal&quot; series of games, in addition to traditional rocket jumps, the weapons can be charged up for a powerful melee attack that can be aimed at the ground to boost the player. In &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), the tau cannon can be charged for a stronger attack that pushes the user back; in the multiplayer mode of the game, the weapon charges up faster, and the knockback is increased to a point where it can also be directed vertically, allowing players to use this as a form of mobility. In the &quot;Halo&quot; game franchise, players often use guns such as the Concussion rifle or Frag grenades to launch the player faster or higher for speedrunning purposes, or to reach normally unreachable areas or easter eggs.
*In &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; it is possible to ride launched missiles to reach other places that are time-consuming, difficult or impossible to access on foot, provided that the rider safely disembarks at a nearby platform before the missile explodes. This technique, called rocket riding, does not follow the typical definition of rocket jumping (in that it does not leverage the force of a rocket explosion), but can be seen to be related to it in that it inherits its risks. Unlike the typical definition of rocket jumping, rocket riding does not rely on the use of knockback nor recoil. As a result, the argument can be made that rocket riding and rocket jumping are unrelated techniques from each other.

==Outside video games==
Rocket jumping has appeared in other media as well. 
*In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, a reference is made to being hoisted with his own petard, or being lifted by the explosion of one&#x27;s own bomb.
*In the live-action film &quot;Transformers&quot;, the character Ironhide performs a rocket jump over a screaming woman after transforming from his truck mode.
*In the film &quot;Planet Terror&quot;, lead character Cherry Darling uses her peg leg, a machine gun with underslung grenade launcher, to rocket jump over a tall wall.
*In the film &quot;Tokyo Gore Police&quot;, lead character Ruka uses a bazooka to rocket jump to a building&#x27;s rooftop.
*In Freddie Wong&#x27;s and Brandon Laatsch&#x27;s video &quot;The Rocket Jump&quot;, the rocket jump is featured as the main part of the YouTube short. This later influenced their channel and studio into being renamed &quot;RocketJump&quot;.
*In the episode &quot;The Librarians and the Point of Salvation&quot; of the second season of the TV series &quot;The Librarians&quot;, rocket jumping is specifically referred to but done using grenades.

<text>Marc Drogin (February 7, 1936 – February 6, 2017) was an American writer and illustrator.

==Biography==
Drogin began work as a technical secretary, first at New York University, and then at Columbia University in New York City. His first drawings appeared as line fillers in New York&#x27;s &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in the 1950s. He turned to journalism as a career in 1960, working as a reporter, editor, and features editor in newspapers from Colorado to Cape Cod. At one point a humorous columnist on &quot;The Chicago Daily News&quot;, he had columns syndicated in newspapers from Britain to Borneo. He was also a staffer on &quot;Look Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Insider&#x27;s Newsletter&quot; in New York.

In 1972, Drogin established his long standing graphic design business in New Hampshire. He became known for his whimsically illustrated business and appointment cards for dentists, physicians, banks, and other businesses in the US and UK.

Drogin became interested in the scripts of the Middle Ages in the 1970s, researched palaeography independently at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England, and wrote &quot;Medieval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique&quot;, which was published in 1980 by Allanheld, Osmun &amp; Co. Publishers, Inc. and Abner Schram, Ltd. It was re-published with corrections in 1989 by Dover Publications. This was followed by a children&#x27;s version titled &quot;Yours Truly, King Arthur&quot;. He then wrote the first-ever published volume on the history of book curses, &quot;Anathema!– Medieval Scribes and the History of Book Curses &quot; (Allanheld &amp; Schram, 1983), and a history of the discovery and destruction of ancient manuscripts called &quot;Biblioclasm&quot;. During this period, he taught calligraphic workshops and lectured across the United States, Canada, England, and Iceland. He is described on the back cover of the Dover edition of his calligraphy book as &quot;a professional calligrapher of medieval styles, as well as illuminator, writer, and teacher.&quot;

For decades, Drogin divided his time between homes in New Hampshire and England. He established an antiques business dealing in miniature decorative objects which he ran both as a brick and mortar business, as well as online. His work for Maggs Brothers as an appraiser and medieval calligraphy expert were often employed in pricing pieces for sale both in Europe and the United States.

Drogin died on February 6, 2017, aged 80.

<doc id="1193308" wikidata="Q5566834" url="?curid=1193308" title="Glasgow Green">
<text>Glasgow Green is a park in the east end of Glasgow, Scotland, on the north bank of the River Clyde. Established in the 15th century, it is the oldest park in the city. It connects to the south via the St Andrew&#x27;s Suspension Bridge.

==History==

In 1450, King James II granted the parkland to Bishop William Turnbull and the people of Glasgow. The Green then looked quite different from the Green today. It was an uneven, swampy area made up of several distinct &quot;greens&quot; (separated by the Camlachie and Molendinar Burns): the High Green; the Low Green; the Calton Green; and the Gallowgate Green. In the centuries that followed, the parkland was used for grazing, washing and bleaching linen, drying fishing nets, and recreational activities like swimming. In 1732, Glasgow&#x27;s first &quot;steamie&quot;, called &quot;the Washhouse&quot;, opened on the banks of the Camlachie Burn.

From 25 December 1745 to 3 January 1746, Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s army camped in &quot;Flesher&#x27;s Haugh&quot; (privately owned at the time, but would become part of Glasgow Green in 1792); Charlie demanded that the town supply his army with fresh clothing and footwear.

In 1765, the Green was the site where inventor James Watt was strolling, when he hit upon the idea of the separate condenser for the steam engine.

In 1792, Glasgow extended the parkland to the east by purchasing an additional stretch of land, known as &quot;Fleshers&#x27; Haugh&quot; from Patrick Bell of Cowcaddens.

===19th century===

In the 19th century, two projects were proposed that would have intruded upon the green. The steamship owner Henry Bell wanted a canal built from the Broomielaw to Glasgow Green with a quay terminal at the green. This proposal was unpopular and was never implemented. Then, in 1821 and 1822, exploratory boring underneath the green uncovered large coal deposits, after which the city&#x27;s Superintendent of Work recommended a mining operation to extract to coal. At the time, the Glasgow Town Council voted against the plan. It was re-introduced in 1858, and this time the town council approved it, because they were looking for ways to offset the cost of purchasing land to create parks in other areas of the town. But their decision was met with such large-scale public opposition that the plan was dropped. The proposal was reintroduced twice more, in 1869 and 1888, but was rejected both times.

When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, there was an economic depression, and many people were unemployed. In response, Glasgow Town Council hired 324 jobless workers to remodel Glasgow Green. In 1817 and 1826, efforts were made to improve the layout of the park. Culverts were built over the Calmachie and Molendinar Burns and the park was levelled out and drained.

Meanwhile, the green became the locus of much political activity. The Radical movement for parliamentary reform was growing, and in 1816, about 40,000 people attended a meeting on the green to support demands for a more representative government and an end to the Corn Laws that kept food prices high.

Then, in the spring of 1820, the green became one of the meeting places for conspirators in what was known as the &quot;Radical War&quot;. Strikers carried out military drills on the green before their brief rebellion was crushed. Later, James Wilson was convicted of treason for allegedly being a leader of the insurrection. He was hanged and beheaded on the green in front of a crowd of about 20,000 people.

When Parliament passed the Reform Act 1832, increasing the electorate from 4,329 (in 1820) to 65,000 (in 1832), over 70,000 people gathered on the green for a demonstration, and a band from the Bridgeton area of Glasgow les a procession lead around the green.

The Chartism movement that grew in response to the Reform Act 1832 eventually resulted in what is known as the &quot;Chartist Riot&quot; of 1848. William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Reform Act 1867, which increased the electorate to 230,606 (in 1868), inspired further demonstrations and meetings on the green.

In April 1872, the “women&#x27;s suffragette society,” that had formed two years earlier, held a large open-air meeting on the green. From then on, until the late 1910s, the women&#x27;s suffrage movement continued to use the green as a meeting place.

The green was also used for sport during the 19th century, notably by two of Scotland&#x27;s oldest sporting clubs: The Clydesdale Amateur Rowing Club was established in 1857 on the south side of the River Clyde (it moved to Glasgow Green in 1901); the Glasgow University Rowing Club (now known as the Glasgow University Boat Club) was established in 1867 at the Green, on the banks of the River Clyde. In May 1872, a group of members from the Clydesdale Amateur Rowing Club formed a football team and began playing against Callander Football Club, using Flesher&#x27;s Haugh on the green as their playing field. This team was later renamed Rangers Football Club.

Glasgow Green railway station opened on the Glasgow Central Railway line in 1895. (It was temporarily closed during World War I, and permanently closed in 1953.)

===20th century===
In the early years of the 20th century, the green continued to be a favored venue for political protests. During World War I, members of the anti-war movement held mass demonstrations on the Green. In September 1914, the revolutionary socialist leader John Maclean held his first anti-war rally there, under Nelson&#x27;s monument. The Military Service Act 1916 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. c. 104) inspired a rally on the green that led to its three lead speakers being imprisoned for 12 months for violations of the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. 29). On 29 June 1916, David Lloyd George was invited to receive the Freedom of the City honour, which sparked mass protests on the green. In May 1917, a number of workers marched through Glasgow to the green in support of Russia&#x27;s February Revolution. World War I also saw an influx of munitions workers into Glasgow. The growing population led to rent increases, which inspired protests on the green in 1920.

In more recent times, the green has been a favorite spot for many live music events. Michael Jackson performed there on 18 August 1992 during his &quot;Dangerous World Tour&quot; in front of 65,000 people; it was the only live show he did in Scotland. In 1990, the Stone Roses performed at the green. The band later split up, but came back together for a world tour, after which they returned to the green on 15 June 2013 and gave another live performance.

===21st century===
In 2004, the Green was host to the Download Festival Scotland, a live music festival featuring Metallica, Linkin Park, Korn, and Slipknot. In May 2014, the Green was the site of Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend, the biggest free ticketed music event in Europe. The event featured some of the biggest acts in the world, and they performed to a total of over 50,000 spectators in the course of the weekend.

As part of the legacy of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the Green became one of 27 sites in Glasgow to be protected by Fields in Trust through a legal &quot;Minute of Agreement&quot;. The agreement aims to ensure that the Green will be preserved as public recreation land for future generations to enjoy.

Since 2017, the Green has served as the venue for the music festival TRNSMT.

The Green is also currently the home of the World Pipe Band Championships.

The Green continues to host sporting events in addition to music events. The annual Great Scottish Run, which is generally held in early October, finishes up on the Green, with runners entering it through the historic McLennan Arch.

===Nelson&#x27;s Monument===
A tall monument to Admiral Horatio Nelson was erected in the Green in 1806, the year after his death. A Nelson monument had been erected in Taynuilt the previous year, privately funded by employees of the Bonawe Iron Foundry, which had made most of the cannonballs for the navy while it was under Nelson&#x27;s command. But the Nelson monument in Glasgow Green was the first civic monument in Britain commemorating Nelson&#x27;s military victories. It predated Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in Dublin by two years and Nelson&#x27;s column in London by three decades. Four years after its construction it was struck by lightning, causing the top 6 metres to collapse, but the damage was promptly repaired. In 1970, the monument became listed as a category A historic site.

Over the course of two centuries since the monument was erected, it accumulated some damage. In 2002, it was repaired and restored to its original condition, and floodlights were installed for nighttime viewing. The cost of the restoration programme was £900,000.

===St. Andrew&#x27;s Suspension Bridge===

The St. Andrew&#x27;s Suspension Bridge opened in 1855. It connects the park to the north with Hutchesontown to the south. It was meant to &quot;replace [the] busy ferry, [by] conveying workers from Bridgeton &amp; Calton to Hutchesontown&quot;. The bridge was repaired in 1871 and 1905. As it neared its 150th birthday, a programme to completely refurbish it was undertaken, partially funded by the European Union, and executed between 1996 and 1998. It is a category A listed structure.

===Glasgow Humane Society===
The Glasgow Humane Society (the oldest practical lifeboat and lifesaving organisation in the world) is based in the Green. The society&#x27;s Officer&#x27;s house and its boatyard are located next to the St. Andrew&#x27;s Suspension Bridge.

===Templeton Factory===

The Templeton Carpet Factory was completed in 1889. After repeated design proposals had been rejected by the city council, James Templeton &amp; Co employed the architect William Leiper, who designed a facade inspired by the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice.

On 1 November 1889, the factory facade collapsed due to insecure fixings; 29 women were killed in adjacent weaving sheds. (The story was carved into a section of stone beneath the base of Templeton Gate, installed during refurbishment work to the area in 2005.) In 1900, a fire in the factory resulted in more deaths.

The building was extended in the 1930s. In 1984 it became the Templeton Business Centre. In 2005, the 1930s extension was demolished to make way for 143 new flats as part of a £22 million regeneration project, and Scottish Enterprise, the center&#x27;s owners sold it for £6.7 million.

===Fountains===
In 1881 a fountain was erected in the park to commemorate Sir William Collins, a figure in the temperance movement who had served as Glasgow&#x27;s Lord Provost between 1877 and 1880. In 1992, the fountain was moved to stand behind the McLennan Arch.

, given by Sir Henry Doulton to Glasgow as part of the International Exhibition of 1888, was moved from Kelvingrove Park to the Green in 1890. Designed by architect Arthur E. Pearce, the -tall fountain was built by the Royal Doulton company to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign. It featured a basin, with a slightly larger than life-size statue of Queen Victoria, surrounded by four life-size statues of water-carriers representing Australasia, Canada, India and South Africa. A lightning strike in 1891 destroyed the statue of Victoria, and, rather than let the city replace the statue with an urn, Doulton paid for a second hand-made statue to be produced. In the 1960s the fountain&#x27;s water was turned off and it was allowed to fall into disrepair. However, in 2002, a £2 million programme began to restore the fountain to its original condition. , the fountain had been placed in a new location, in front of the People&#x27;s Palace. It is category A listed.

===People&#x27;s Palace===

The People&#x27;s Palace was opened in 1898 by the Earl of Rosebery. It was designed as a cultural centre for residents in the east end of the city. It originally had reading rooms on the ground floor, a museum on the first floor, and an art gallery on the second floor. Since the 1940s, it has been a museum dedicated to the history of Glasgow. It is category A listed.

===McLennan Arch===
In 1890, the Assembly Rooms building that had been designed by James and Robert Adam was demolished. However, the arch that had formed the centrepiece of the building was reconstructed, with funding provided by James McLennan, and in 1893 it was sited at the western end of Monteith Row. In 1922, it was moved to the western edge of the Green, facing Charlotte Street. In 1991, it was moved again to its present position in the Green — facing the Old High Court in the Saltmarket. It is known as &quot;The McLennan Arch&quot;.

===Tidal Weir===
 In 1901, the Glasgow Corporation built a tidal weir over the River Clyde, in an effort to maintain the river&#x27;s water level as it runs through the Green. The water is saltwater on the western side of the weir and fresh water on the eastern side, where it runs past the park. This has resulted in an unusual phenomenon: the development of two distinct ecosystems right next to each other. Because of its distinctive design, the weir has been made a listed building. A short distance downstream from the weir is the Albert Bridge, which connects the area to the Gorbals district south of the river.

===Fleshers&#x27; Haugh===
The Glasgow Green Football Centre, featuring 18 different football pitches of various sizes and qualities, opened in November 2000 on Fleshers&#x27; Haugh, the site where Scottish football club Rangers played their first ever match against Callander over a hundred years earlier. This area is also the location of the Glasgow National Hockey Centre, built for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

At the west side of this part of the Green is the King&#x27;s Bridge providing a road link to Hutchesontown. There was a pedestrian link to the Oatlands district on the south side of the river, namely Polmadie Bridge, but in 2015 this was declared unsafe and dismantled. Further upstream at the south-east edge of the Green is Rutherglen Bridge.

Glasgow Green also has within it part of National Cycle Route 75, which runs from Argyll to Edinburgh, as well as the Clyde walkway, which runs from the City Centre to New Lanark.

<doc id="1193311" wikidata="Q7399055" url="?curid=1193311" title="Yashwantrao Chavan Sagareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary">
<text>Yashwantrao Chavan Sagareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is located at the meeting of three Tehsils of Sangli district: Kadegaon, Walva and Palus. The wildlife sanctuary is man-made; it is an artificially cultivated forest without a perennial supply of water, and most of the wildlife species were artificially introduced. It has an area of 10.87 km2.

==Flora and fauna==

The sanctuary is forested, but with grassy hill slopes. The forests are southern dry mixed deciduous and southern thorn forest. Protection from grazing and forest fire has resulted in good regeneration of dry deciduous species. The forest department introduced many plants in the area, including Tamarind, Neem, Nilgiri, Acacia, Agave, and Khair.

Large animals found in the sanctuary include several types of deer (Sambar Deer, Blackbucks, Muntjac, Chital) as well as wild boar and peacocks. Small carnivores like fox and porcupines are also found in the area. A large number of insects, birds and reptiles such as pythons and other snakes are also present.

==Tourism==

The sanctuary is a popular tourist destination, with the peak tourism season being from August to February. The most popular tourist activity is hiking to the top of a hill in the sanctuary, from which one can see the Krishna River flowing through fields of sugarcane and grapevines. Also in the area are numerous shrines to Shiva which were built during the Chalukya dynasty, and the Krishna Valley Wine Park in Palus. Kundal, the region around Sangli, was the capital of the Chalukyas, a historical place.

== About Sagareshwar ==
The Sagareshwar sanctuary has much religious, cultural and archaeological significance. The sanctuary derives its name from an ancient famous Shiva temple that attracts a large number of devotees. It actually consists of one large temple and a complex of 51 small temples, all from the Satvahana period. You will find the Kamal Bhairao temple, partially hewn from hard basalt rock perched on the edge of a steep cliff. The entrance to the temple is through a narrow tunnel.

<text>Club Deportivo Veracruz, commonly known as Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz, was a Mexican professional football club based in the city of Veracruz. Founded in 1943, and played in the Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football.

In December 2019, the Mexican Football Federation announced the disaffiliation of Veracruz from Liga MX due to economic debts with first team players, its youth system, and the league.

==History==
The club was founded around April 1943 under the name of Club Deportivo Veracruz after two clubs from the city state of Veracruz, Iberia de Córdoba and Veracruz Sporting Club, merged in order to join the Mexican First Division. At the time, both clubs played in Liga Veracruzana, an amateur league in Veracruz. These two clubs had dominated the Liga Amateur de Veracruz, winning 21 titles combined. Each of these clubs had a short stay in the Primera Fuerza – a now defunct amateur football league in Mexico City – in the early 1920s but due to the distance, the clubs generally played in the local league which was less competitive. The club kept the Veracruz Sporting Club colors, red and black, which they used in the early part of its existence and a few years later would switch the black to white, keeping red as the club&#x27;s main shirt color. In their first year the club played in Parque Deportivo Veracruzano sharing the field with baseball club Rojos del Águila de Veracruz. The club&#x27;s nickname was given by Manuel Seyde who had also help merge the two clubs. The club had the honor of having been one of the first clubs to play in the professional league as well as having been the first club not from Mexico City to win the tournament. Among other records the club holds is most relegations (four times) including being relegated in 2008 by its hated rival Puebla who had just been promoted the year before. The club has played in the Liga de Ascenso ever since, coming close to promotion a couple of times but falling short each time.

The club played its first game in the 1943–44 Copa México tournament against Atlante who beat them 5–1. The club&#x27;s first goal was scored by Manuel Rodríguez Angues, nicknamed as Manolín.

In their 1945–46 league Veracruz played 18 games with a streak of 14 wins and 4 draws. Veracruz also won their first title in that year. In the season 1947–48 they won their first Mexican Cup by beating the Chivas 3–1. Soon Veracruz won their second title, in the 1949–50 season, with the most overwhelming victory in the history of Mexican football, beating Monterrey, 14–0.

Years later Veracruz acquired famous players such as René Higuita, Braulio Luna, Adolfo Ríos, Luis Hernández, Fernando Arce, Alfredo Tena and others. After being relegated to the Primera División A Veracruz came back in 2002 after being declared Primera División A champions and finished 11th place in the Summer of 2002. The Apertura 2004 season had been one of the best for Veracruz as they finished 1st place thanks to new signings such as Cuauhtémoc Blanco, Christian Giménez, Kléber Boas and others. Veracruz has had 59 managers so far, as of 2008. On the night of Friday April 25, 2008 at Luis &quot;Pirata&quot; Fuente stadium (Home of the Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz), UNAM defeated Veracruz with a final score of 4–2, sending Veracruz to the Primera A division league. Veracruz was officially relegated from the Mexican Primera División league on the night of Friday May 2, 2008 in the final match of the regular season against Tecos UAG ending in a 0–0 draw.

===First title===

In the club&#x27;s third year of existence in the 1945–46 tournament, the club went on to win 18 games with a record of 14 wins and 4 draws, managing to win 8 straight. The club scored 105 goals that year, leading the club in scoring was the Argentine Jorge Enrico followed by Raimundo Gonzalez with 24. Luis de la Fuente was considered the club&#x27;s best player because of his unique playing style.

It was on 2 June 1946, in the second to last round of the tournament in the &quot;Parque Asturias&quot; in Mexico City, home of Real Club España where the club won 2–3 and so were able to claim themselves champions for the first time. With goals scored by José Valdivia, Luis de la Fuente and Raimundo Gonzalez, they ended a 26-year streak of the tournament being won by a club from Mexico City. That same year the club went on to lose the Campeón de Campeones title against Atlas.

===First Copa México title===
In the 1947–48 Copa México tournament, with the departure of the club&#x27;s best players (the Argentine Jorge Enrico along with other good players such as Lazcano and Pachuco Durán, and maybe the club&#x27;s most important trainer, Palomini) the club still won its first Copa México. The final was played against Guadalajara with a final score of 3–1 under the management of the Spaniard Joaquin Urquiaga. That is the only cup to date the club has won, finishing runner-up 3 times: in 1949–50, 1967–68 and 1994–95.

===Second title===

In the 1949–50 tournament the club won its last Mexican Primera División title till date. The club started off that year with a rejuvenated squad led by Juan Luque de Serrallonga who had just come from a stay with the Mexico national football team the year before. This year is also remembered because the club had its first goal scoring champion: the Peruvian Julio Ayllon, also known as El Negro, black promotional football players in Mexico being uncommon at that time; Julio went on to score 30 goals that year.

===The end of a Golden Era===
The club welcomed the new decade with the start of the end of its golden age. The 1950–51 tournament became the first losing year due to economical problems the club faced under the ownership of Miguel Alemán Valdez and governor of the state Marco Antonio Muñoz.

The worst season came in the 1951–52 tournament after a long relegation fight that came down to the end against Club América; they lost and were relegated for the first time in history to the newly created Segunda División de México. That year the club finished with a record of 3 wins, 6 draws, and 13 losses allowing 54 goals and only scoring 22 for a total of 12 points, just 3 behind Club América (who kept the category and is one of two clubs that has never been relegated since the professionalization of the sport in Mexico).

In the 1952–53 tournament, playing in the Segunda División de México, the club finished the year just one point away from been promoted behind Toluca, who has played in the first division ever since. After that disappointing year almost all the players left the club following the 1953 cup tournament. As a result, the leagues decided to disband the club.

===Return 1960s–1970s===
In 1961, thanks to a group of supporters, they established a patronage in which José Lajud Kuri was named president and so revived the club in order to take part in the 1961–62 Segunda División de México tournament. The first couple of years were mediocre and they didn&#x27;t have any success.

In 1964 the club was presented with an opportunity to be promoted after the league decided to increase the number of clubs from 14 to 16. That year, the worst first division club, Nacional de Guadalajara, played a promotional playoff tournament against Segunda División de México Petroleros de Ciudad Madero. Poza Rica and Veracruz had finished 2nd, 3rd and 4th (not counting Cruz Azul who had earned an automatic promotion after winning the tournament). That tournament ended with Nacional de Guadalajara and Veracruz earning first and second with Petroleros de Ciudad Madero third and Poza Rica fourth. The club had returned to the first division after 12 years of bitter, bitter waiting.

In the 1964–65 first division tournament the club played their first game on June 7, 1964, against Atletico Morelia in the city of Morelia in a 3–3 draw. The club&#x27;s first goal since coming back was scored by Jesus Mercado. That year the club had a record of 10 wins, 8 draws, and 12 defeats; they scored 41 and allowed 44 for a total of 28 points and fishing 10 overall in the league. Their best game was played in the 8th round when they defeated Zacatepec 5–1. In 1978–79 the club was relegated for the second time after losing 22 games allowing 83 goals and finishing last in the competition. One thing to mention is that the club had five different trainers that year. One week before their last game in the first division the club secured their relegation after losing, 5–2, against Club Universidad de Guadalajara in the city of Guadalajara. The last game the club played in that tournament was against Tigres de la UANL one June 3, 1979, at home where they had a draw of 1–1 and so ended their second stay in the first division while ending another decade.

===1980s===
The club started the 1980s in the Segunda División de México . After the 1983–84 tournament the club was sold to the city of Yucatán where it became Venados de Yucatán. This club lasted a couple years before folding in 1998.

After several years of not having a football club representing the state of Veracruz, various attempts were made in order revive the club. One such was to buy the Ángeles de Puebla franchise which at the time was on sale due to the lack of supporters. The club had been in the same city as Puebla who had won two league titles and 2 Copa México titles in the 1980s. But in 1989, a group of local businessmen along with funding by the governor of the city of Veracruz bought the newly promoted club Potros Neza which at the time was affiliated with first division club Atlante. The club played their first tournament game that same year and lost to Puebla under the management of Héctor Sanabria. That year the club finished 5th in group 4 with a total of 34 - nonetheless the club won over supporters by playing with a lot of heart. Players such as Davidovich, José Luís Marroquín, Castañon, Salcedo, Pascual Ramírez, Jardon Eduardo Rergis, Eduardo Moses, Omar Palma, and Jorge Comas stood out. That year is remembered as La Tiburomania because no matter where the club played it always had a great deal of support no matter the distance. The club return started a euphoria in the city in the 1989–90 tournament when the club had 19 straight sell-outs. It all came to a climax when the club played top club Club América in the Estadio Azteca where 50,000 Veracruz supporters poured into a stadium with a capacity of 114,000 and they set a record for the most supports attending an away game. That game ended in a 3–5 win for the home team in a controversial match refereed by Javier Castellanos.

That same year there was a four-way special tournament inviting Brazilian club Botafogo, Spanish club Real Madrid and local club UNAM. Botafogo ended up taking home the cup but the fans remember this tournament because the club beat Real Madrid, 4–2, with a goal by the Argentine Omar Palma.

===1990s===

The 1990s began with a group of players and a fan base which became known as La Tiburomaniam who cheer own fan favorite players Jorge Comas Adolfo Ríos, Joaquín Del Olmo, Octavio Becerril, Pascual Ramírez, José Luís González China under management of the Brazilian Edu. The club failed to qualify to the play-offs after a long battle for 2nd place in group 3 against Cruz Azul.

In the 1991–92 tournament the club give its supporters something to cheer for after a bad start of the tournament which caused the existed of them club taker Angel Lopez who was replaced by Roberto Matosas. After the change of trainer the club had a much better tournament which qualified the club to a knockout play-off series against Correcaminos UAT which they won, 4–3, which they handed done since the club was reform in 1970. The club faced Necaxa in quarterfinals where they lost, 6–2.

In the 1993–94 the club celebrated its 50 anniversary with a special ceremony prior to the tournament where former club greats reunited to play a special match. That preseason the club signed former greats Carlos Poblete and Rubén Omar Romano. That year is also remembered for that great friendly match the club had against Atlético Madrid.

In the 1994–95 tournament under the management of Anibal Ruiz who with a peculiar defensive style of coaching made the fans lose interest in the club nonetheless the club qualified to play a knock-out match against its hated rival Puebla who advanced to the quarterfinals after a 1–1 draw moving on due to a better position in the league. The club came close that year to winning the 1994–95 Copa México title after beating Irapuato, Estudiantes Tecos and Santos Laguna in that order facing Necaxa in the final match that took place in neutral ground in the Estadio Cuauhtémoc in the city of Puebla where the club fell 2–0. In 1995 the club was sold to local TV network Televisa who brought in better playgoers to the club reviving once again the hopes of the supporters.

In the 1996–97 the new owners signed José Mari Bakero who had just finished a long career with Spanish giant Barcelona along with key players from the Colombia national team Leonel Álvarez, Iván Valenciano, Alexis Mendoza mating important players and fan favorite goalkeeper Adolfo Ríos. With the hype of the club&#x27;s new players many gave the club a chance of taking the league title but after a tournament field with injuries and with a divided locker-room the club gained only nine points and finished last leaving the club with relegation problems for the next campaign.

In the 1997–98 tournament the club let go most of the players bringing in the international known goalkeeper René Higuita along with players that were unknown in the league in order to avoid their third relegation. With lack of experience the players had the club ended that tournament with a record of 3 wins, 5 draws losing 9 games for a total of 14 points and so once selling their thirrd relegation in club history.

In the Invierno del 98 playing now in the Primera A the club started their journey to return once again to the top division hiring Juan Manuel Alvarez who had achieved this task before with Club Celaya a few years back. With the supports still hurt by the relegation at mid tournament Juan Manuel Alvarez was replaced by &quot;El Turco&quot; Aude coach who had much experience in the league and rallied the players reaching the semi-finals that year, losing the series to Venados de Yucatán.

In 1999 the club was sold to city of Veracruz along with local business owners. The club had one of the worst seasons in its history that inverno 99 with a club mostly formed by veteran players along with young experienced players. In that tournament the club failed to qualify for the play-offs and the promotion seemed impossible each day – and that is how the club ended that decade with some strong clubs in the early part of the decade and with the club&#x27;s third relation at the end of it.

===2000s===

In the 2000–01 tournament the club finally lived up to its expectation becoming a competitive club in the Primera A the first have under the management of Carlos Trucco and Roberto Saporiti in other half, these two managers went on to win several games that would qualify them to the playoff where they were eliminated but had revived interest in the locals. At the end of that tournament the first division expanded from 18 to 20 which promoted two clubs that year. La Piedad was promoted after winning the Verano 2001 Primera A tournament and going on to win the Promotion match against Toros Neza. A promotion series was played between Atlante who had the worst relegation percentage against the club that had gain the most points in the Primera A that been Veracruz. A second promotion match was played between those two clubs the first match was played in jam packed Estadio Luis de la Fuente in Veracruz in match that ended in a 0–0 draw. The second match was played in the Estadio Azteca where Atlante defeated the Veracruz, 4–1, and remained in the top division.

===2008 relegation===
In the 2007 Apertura the club finished second to last in the percentage table just above Puebla and below Tigres UANL with a percentage of 1.0706.

In the Primera División de México Clausura 2008 the club once again had a bad year with a record of 4 wins, 5 draws and losing 8 for a total of 17 points finishing 16 in the league. The club shed its relegation after losing at home against their direct rivals in the relegation fight Puebla with a score of 2–0. The club&#x27;s relegation was made official in the following match against UNAM at home losing 4–2 and setting a new league record for a relegation with 4.

The club played in the Liga de Ascenso since the Apertura 2008 and came close several times but always coming short.

===2011 Disaffiliation===
On June 3, 2011, the FMF disaffiliated the Tiburones Rojos because of a failure of payments to the FMF.

Their players became free agents, free to sign with any club, and their women&#x27;s team was also kicked out of the Liga MX Femenil.

<text>Toomas Hendrik Ilves (; born 26 December 1953) is an Estonian politician who served as the fourth president of Estonia from 2006 until 2016.

Ilves worked as a diplomat and journalist, and he was the leader of the Social Democratic Party in the 1990s. He served in the government as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1996 to 1998 and again from 1999 to 2002. Later, he was a Member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2006. He was elected as President of Estonia by an electoral college on 23 September 2006 and his term as President began on 9 October 2006. He was reelected by Parliament in 2011.

==Early life and education==
Ilves was born in Stockholm, Sweden; his parents Endel Ilves (1923–1991) and Irene Ilves (&quot;née&quot; Rebane; 1925–2018) fled Estonia after its occupation by the Soviet Union during World War II. His maternal grandmother was supposedly a Russian from Saint Petersburg, but Ilves denies this, stating that his maternal grandmother was an ethnic Karaim.

He grew up in the United States by residing in Leonia, New Jersey and graduated from Leonia High School in 1972 as valedictorian. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Columbia University in 1976 and a master&#x27;s degree in the same subject from the University of Pennsylvania in 1978. He also received an honorary degree from St. Olaf College in 2014 in recognition of his relationship with the college. In addition to his native Estonian, Ilves also speaks English, German, Spanish and Latvian. By Ilves&#x27;s own admission, he speaks Estonian with a comparatively strong American accent, on account of spending his formative and young adult years in America and Germany.

==Career==

Ilves worked as a research assistant in Columbia University Department of Psychology from 1973 to 1979. From 1979 to 1981 he served as assistant director and English teacher at the Open Education Center in Englewood, New Jersey. Ilves then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; from 1981 to 1983 he was director and administrator of arts at Vancouver Arts Centre and from 1983 to 1985, he taught Estonian literature and linguistics at Simon Fraser University.

From 1985 to 1993, Ilves worked in Munich, Germany as a journalist for Radio Free Europe, being the head of its Estonian desk since 1988. As Estonia had restored its independence in 1991, Ilves became Ambassador of Estonia to the United States in 1993, also serving as Ambassador to Canada and Mexico at the same time.

In December 1996, Ilves became Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving until he resigned in September 1998, when he became a member of a small opposition party (Peasants&#x27; Party, agrarian-conservative). Ilves was soon elected chairman of the People&#x27;s Party (reformed Peasants&#x27; Party), which formed an electoral cartel with the Moderates, a centrist party. After the March 1999 parliamentary election he became foreign minister again, serving until 2002, when the so-called Triple Alliance collapsed. He supported Estonian membership in the European Union and succeeded in starting the negotiations which led to Estonia joining the European Union on 1 May 2004. From 2001 to 2002 he was the leader of the People&#x27;s Party Moderates. He resigned from the position after the party&#x27;s defeat in the October 2002 municipal elections, in which the party received only 4.4% of the total votes nationwide. In early 2004, the Moderates party renamed itself the Estonian Social Democratic Party.

In 2003, Ilves became an observer member of the European Parliament and, on 1 May 2004, a full member. In the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, Ilves was elected MEP in a landslide victory for the Estonian Social Democratic Party. He sat with the Party of European Socialists group in the Parliament. Katrin Saks took over his MEP seat when Ilves became President of Estonia in 2006. In 2011, he was re-elected for a second five-year term.

In 2013, it was announced that Ilves had accepted a position on the Council on CyberSecurity&#x27;s Advisory Board. In 2015, it was announced that Ilves had agreed to join the group of advisers to the World Bank president Jim Yong Kim.

During his presidency, Ilves has been appointed to serve in several high positions in the field of ICT in the European Union. He served as chairman of the EU Task Force on eHealth from 2011 to 2012 and was chairman of the European Cloud Partnership Steering Board at the invitation of the European Commission from 2012 to 2014. In 2013 he chaired the High-Level Panel on Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms convened by ICANN. From 2014 to 2015 Ilves was the co-chair of the advisory panel of the World Bank&#x27;s World Development Report 2016 &quot;Digital Dividends&quot; and was also the chair of World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Agenda Council on Cyber Security beginning in June 2014.

Beginning in 2016, Ilves has been co-chairing The World Economic Forum working group &quot;The Global Futures Council on Blockchain Technology&quot;. In 2017 he joined Stanford University as a Bernard and Susan Liautaud Visiting Fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation in the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. From July 2017, Ilves has been a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.

Ilves belongs to the advisory council of the Alliance for Securing Democracy.

On 25 September 2020, Ilves was named as one of the 25 members of the &quot;Real Facebook Oversight Board&quot;, an independent monitoring group unaffiliated with, but created in response to, the Oversight Board, Facebook Inc.&#x27;s content moderation review board.

In 2024, Ilves was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Rebel with a Bow Tie&quot; (Estonian: &quot;Kikilipsuga Mässaja&quot;), directed by filmmaker Jaan Tootsen, who was formerly Ilves&#x27;s cultural advisor during his presidency. The film debuted at the 28th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival on 15 November 2024.

==Presidential elections==

Ilves was nominated by the Reform Party, Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica and his own Social Democratic Party on 23 March 2006, as a candidate for the 2006 presidential election.

On 29 August, Ilves was the only candidate in the second and the third round of the presidential election in Riigikogu, the Parliament of Estonia (he was supported by an electoral coalition consisting of the governing Reform Party plus the Social Democrats and the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica which form the parliamentary opposition). Ilves gathered 64 votes out of 65 ballots. Therefore, one deputy of the three party alliance supporting Ilves did not vote in favour of his candidacy. A two-thirds majority in the 101-seat Riigikogu was required, so he was not elected in Riigikogu. His candidacy was automatically transferred to the next round in the Electors&#x27; Assembly on 23 September.

On 13 September 2006, a broad spectrum of 80 well-known intellectuals published a declaration in support of Ilves&#x27; candidacy. Among those who signed were Neeme Järvi, Jaan Kross, Arvo Pärt and Jaan Kaplinski.

On 23 September 2006, he received 174 ballots in the first round of the presidential election in the Electors&#x27; Assembly, thus having been elected the next president of Estonia. His five-year term started on 9 October 2006.

On 29 August 2011, he was reelected by the 101-seat legislature to a second five-year term. His opponent was Indrek Tarand. He received support from 73 members of the legislature, and is the first candidate to be elected in the first round since Estonia regained independence in 1991.

==Personal life==

Ilves has been married three times. With his first wife, American psychologist Merry Bullock, he has two children. In 2004, Ilves married his longtime partner Evelin Int-Lambot, with whom he has one daughter. They divorced in April 2015. In January 2016 he married Ieva Kupče, the head of the Cybersecurity Division in the Defense Ministry of Latvia. They have a son. They divorced in December 2023.

He maintains a Twitter account, personally posting on a regular basis to comment on both current events and his own interests, usually in English.

Ilves has a brother, Andres Ilves, formerly head of the Persian and Pashto World Service of the BBC. Until the early 2000s, Andres Ilves was head of the Afghanistan bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty based in Prague, Czech Republic.

He is a member of the Estonian Students&#x27; Society.

<text>Bonshaw is a former rural municipality in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island within Queens County.

== History ==
The Municipality of Bonshaw was originally incorporated in 1977. It incorporated as a rural municipality on January 1, 2018. The Strathgartney Homestead in Bonshaw, the remnants of a former estate, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996 in recognition of the absentee landowner problem that persisted in Prince Edward Island until the passage of the &quot;Land Purchase Act&quot; of 1875. The province designated a rock in Bonshaw with etchings from the 1880s as a heritage site on February 2, 2015.

On September 1, 2020, the Rural Municipality of Bonshaw amalgamated with the rural municipalities of Afton, Meadowbank, New Haven-Riverdale, and West River. The amalgamated municipality was named the Rural Municipality of West River.

== Geography ==
Bonshaw is located near the province&#x27;s south shore on the Northumberland Strait. It is located in the valley of the Bonshaw River, also known as the Tjigaoegatig (Miꞌkmaq for &#x27;bass place&#x27;) River or West River and is surrounded by low rolling hills colloquially referred to as the Bonshaw Hills. The freshwater portion of the river at the tidehead offers trout fishing. Localities within Bonshaw include Bonshaw and Crosbys Mill.

== Attractions ==
Bonshaw has hiking and biking trails. Bonshaw Provincial Park is on the eastern edge of Bonshaw.

<doc id="1193334" wikidata="Q2125381" url="?curid=1193334" title="Radames Pera">
<text>Radames Pera (born September 14, 1960) is an American actor best known for his role as &quot;Grasshopper&quot;, the student Kwai Chang Caine in the 1972 to 1975 television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;.

==Early life and acting career==
Pera was born in New York City, the son of actress Lisa Pera and Spin Art&#x27;s inventor, Eugene R. Pera. The couple split shortly after moving to Hollywood with their son in 1963. Over the next five years Lisa reached some notable success as an actor in film and network TV.

In 1968, at age eight, Radames was discovered by classic film Director Daniel Mann to play the role of Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas&#x27; dying son in the feature &quot;A Dream of Kings&quot; (1969). The two met at a dinner party Radames&#x27; mother held and he got cast in the role of Stavros.

After numerous young character roles, between 1972 until 1975 Radames appeared as Young Caine (better known as &quot;Grasshopper&quot;) in the ABC television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Caine was an orphan from Hunan Province in China who had an American father and a Chinese mother. He appeared throughout the original 4-year run of the hit Warner Bros./ABC series and for many more years in worldwide re-runs. For the role, Radames had to have his head shaved in the Pilot and Second Season, opting for bald-cap makeup during the 1st and 3rd seasons.

In &quot;Kung Fu&quot; Radames mainly worked with veteran Asian-American actors Philip Ahn (Master Kan), Keye Luke (blind Master Po, who named him &quot;Grasshopper&quot;) and Richard Loo (Master Sun). His &quot;flashback&quot; scenes mostly took place in a Shaolin Monastery where he was taught by monks to be a Shaolin priest and kung-fu master. He is depicted as the first person to be welcomed into a Shaolin Monastery who was not of full Chinese birth. Kwai Chang Caine as an adult was played by David Carradine.

Radames also had a recurring role on &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; as John (Jr.), eldest adopted son of Mr. Edwards, and became Mary Ingalls&#x27; love interest during the show&#x27;s second and third seasons.

Pera&#x27;s other acting roles include a disturbed pre-teen in an episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Silent Snow, Secret Snow&quot;, narrated by Orson Welles; guest appearances on &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;; and as Don Ameche&#x27;s son in the telefilm &quot;Gidget Gets Married&quot;. Between 1969 and 1985 other guest-starring credits include &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Family Affair&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;The Waltons&quot; among many others.

Radames withdrew from the acting business entirely after 1987. His final television appearances were on &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s The New Mike Hammer&quot;, and &quot;Starman&quot;. His last film role of the 20th century was as a Soviet soldier, Sgt. Stepan Gorsky in John Milius&#x27; &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984).

He has been living in France since 2017.

==Post-acting career==
Pera developed other interests in video and electronics, forming his own company, &quot;All Systems Go!&quot; in L.A. in 1988, designing and installing home theaters and residential sound systems for clients like Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, Sharon Stone, Winona Ryder, Robert Downey,Jr., Ben Stiller, Chuck Norris and others. Six years later he successfully relocated his life and business to Portland, Oregon for the next ten years, then to Austin, Texas, for another eight years. He continued to specialize in eliminating remote control clutter and other AV and WiFi solutions at his San Diego–based company, Remotalize (2012–2015). After retiring from the AV business Radames moved to France in 2017, where he wrote his memoirs and is currently seeking a literary agent and publisher.

<doc id="1193337" wikidata="Q2739920" url="?curid=1193337" title="Arbiter (Halo)">
<text>In the &quot;Halo&quot; universe, an Arbiter is a ceremonial, religious, and political rank bestowed upon Covenant Elites. In the 2004 video game &quot;Halo 2&quot;, the rank is given to a disgraced commander named Thel &#x27;Vadam as a way to atone for his failures. Although the Arbiter is intended to die serving the Covenant leadership, the High Prophets, he survives his missions and the Prophets&#x27; subsequent betrayal of his kind. When he learns that the Prophets&#x27; plans would doom all sentient life in the galaxy, the Arbiter allies with the Covenant&#x27;s enemies (humans) and stops the ringworld Halo from being activated. The Arbiter is a playable character in &quot;Halo 2&quot; and its 2007 sequel &quot;Halo 3.&quot; The character also appears in &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot; and additional expanded universe material. A different Arbiter, Ripa &#x27;Moramee appears in the 2009 real-time strategy game &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, which takes place 20 years before the events of the main trilogy.

The appearance of the Arbiter in &quot;Halo 2&quot; and the change in perspective from the main human protagonist Master Chief to a former enemy was a plot twist &quot;Halo&quot; developer Bungie kept highly secret. The character&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Dervish&quot; after concerns that the name reinforced a perceived United States-versus-Islam allegory in the game&#x27;s plot. Actor Keith David lends his voice to the character in &quot;Halo 2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, and &quot;5&quot;, while David Sobolov voices the Arbiter of &quot;Halo Wars&quot;.

The Arbiter has appeared as action figures and other collectibles and marketing, in addition to appearances in the games. Bungie intended the sudden point of view switch to a member of the Covenant as a plot twist that no one would have seen coming, but the character in particular and the humanization of the Covenant in general was not evenly received by critics and fans. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; derided the Arbiter&#x27;s missions as some of the worst parts of &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Conversely, &quot;IGN&quot; lamented the loss of the Arbiter&#x27;s story in &quot;Halo 3&quot; and missed the added dimension the character provided to the story. Retrospective opinions have been more positive, with critics complimenting his distinction from Master Chief and his design. 

==Character design==
The concept of the Arbiter came from early story discussions for &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Bungie designer Jaime Griesemer and story director Joseph Staten discussed playing from the perspective of an alien soldier to see the other side of the war between the human United Nations Space Command and alien Covenant. &quot;What if you were the guy whose butt was on the line for protecting the most valuable religious object in the entire world, and you blew it?&quot; said Staten. &quot;That seems like a pretty interesting story, and one we should tell.&quot; &quot;Halo&quot; developer Bungie&#x27;s former content manager Frank O&#x27;Connor said that the inclusion of the Arbiter as a playable character in &quot;Halo 2&quot; was supposed to be a &quot;secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist&quot; which Bungie kept the public uninformed until the game&#x27;s release; O&#x27;Connor never included it in the weekly development updates posted at Bungie&#x27;s website, and insisted story details about the Arbiter&#x27;s past would remain mysterious. Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was &quot;to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn&#x27;t always clear-cut. We knew we had a trilogy on our hands, so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [to the events of &quot;Halo 3&quot;]&quot;. While there were those in Bungie who were against the Arbiter as a player character, Staten chalked its inclusion in the game to a combination of wearing down his opponents and the gameplay sandbox opportunities that came from having Covenant allies.

The Arbiter changed very little during development, as the overall appearance of the alien Covenant Elites (Sangheili) had been designed and developed for the previous game, 2001&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The only substantial difference between the Arbiter and other Elites was special ceremonial armor, which appeared in early concept sketches as part of the character&#x27;s final design. During &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s early developmental stages the character&#x27;s name was &quot;Dervish&quot;, a name from the Sufi sect of Islam. Bungie picked the name because of its evocation of an otherworldly holy warrior. Out of context, Microsoft Game Studios&#x27; &quot;geocultural review&quot; consultants found nothing wrong with the name. However, as Tom Edwards, a consultant who worked with Microsoft during the review noted, &quot;within the game&#x27;s context this Islamic-related name of &#x27;Dervish&#x27; set up a potentially problematic allegory related to &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s plot—the [United States]-like forces (Master Chief/Sarge) versus Islam (the religious Covenant, which already had a &#x27;Prophet of Truth&#x27; which is one title for Muhammad)&quot;. In the geopolitical reality after the September 11 attacks, sensitivity to the name remained high, and the character&#x27;s name was changed. The switch came so late that the game&#x27;s voice lines had to be re-recorded, and some game manuals were printed with the wrong name.

For &quot;Halo 5&quot;, the Arbiter&#x27;s armor was redesigned, explained in-universe as a tribute to previous Arbiters and as a symbol of transition for the Elites. 343 Industries designed the armor to look &quot;medieval&quot; and antiquated, and incorporated brass and leather accents instead of something more futuristic.

The Arbiter in the main video games is voiced by American actor Keith David. David noted that he enjoys voicing complicated characters who have a past. To make an impact with voice acting, he said, is difficult—&quot;it&#x27;s either good acting or it&#x27;s bad acting&quot;. David is not a frequent video game player, but stated in 2008 that he had become more known for his work as the Arbiter than for his other roles.

==Major appearances==
Presented in &quot;Halo 2&quot;, the rank of &quot;Arbiter&quot; is bestowed upon a Covenant Elite by the Covenant leadership—the High Prophets—during a time of crisis; the position is typically given to shamed Elites as an opportunity to regain their honour prior to their deaths via suicide missions of importance to the Covenant. The Arbiter in the main &quot;Halo&quot; games is named Thel &#x27;Vadamee. Previously a commander in the Covenant military, he is shamed for failing to stop the human soldier Master Chief from destroying the Forerunner ringworld Halo (as depicted during the events of &quot;&quot;); the Covenant revere the Forerunners as gods and believe the rings are the key to the salvation central to their religion. Thel &#x27;Vadamee is spared execution by the High Prophets and becomes the newest Arbiter. His first mission is to silence a renegade Elite who has been preaching that the Prophets have lied to the Covenant. The Arbiter is then sent to the newly discovered Delta Halo to retrieve the key necessary to activate the ring. Though he succeeds in his mission, the Arbiter is betrayed by the Brute Chieftan Tartarus; Tartarus reveals that the Prophets have ordered the replacement of the Elites with Brutes in the Covenant power structure. Though the Arbiter is believed dead, he and Master Chief are rescued by the parasitic Flood intelligence Gravemind. Gravemind reveals that the activation Halos are weapons of destruction, not salvation, and sends the Arbiter to stop Tartarus from activating the ring as the Covenant falls into civil war. In the process, the Arbiter and allied Elites forge an alliance with the humans Miranda Keyes and Avery Johnson. Together they kill Tartarus and stop the activation of Delta Halo, triggering a failsafe; the remaining Halo installations are put on standby from remote activation from a Forerunner installation known as the Ark. As a playable character, the Arbiter was identical to the Master Chief, save for the replacement of a flashlight with an active camouflage system.

While Thel &#x27;Vadam remains a playable character in &quot;Halo 3&quot; during cooperative gameplay (the second player in a game lobby controls him), the game&#x27;s story never switches to the point of view of the character as in &quot;Halo 2&quot;. For much of &quot;Halo 3&quot;, the Arbiter assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside Master Chief. They follow Covenant forces through a portal to the Ark, where the Arbiter kills the final surviving High Prophet. During the escape, the ship Arbiter and Master Chief are on is split in two; the Arbiter crashes safely to Earth while Master Chief is presumed lost. Novels and other works detail the Arbiter&#x27;s efforts in the subsequent civil war that breaks out among the Sangheili.

Thel &#x27;Vadam reappears in &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot;, where his forces, the Swords of Sangheilios, remain locked in combat with a faction of Covenant on Sanghelios. When a group of human soldiers travel to Sanghelios and rescues the Arbiter from attack, the Arbiter assists them in an assault on the final Covenant stronghold of Sunaion. After the human artificial intelligence Cortana begins subjugating the galaxy, the Arbiter and the Master Chief are reunited.

Taking place 20 years before the events of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, Ensemble Studio&#x27;s &quot;Halo Wars&quot; (2009) features a different Arbiter from the character seen in the trilogy. Lead designer David Pottinger described Ensemble&#x27;s Arbiter as a &quot;mean guy. He&#x27;s Darth Vader times ten.&quot; The characterization stemmed from a desire to make the Covenant more basically &quot;evil&quot; in order to provide a good-guy–bad-guy conflict. Parts of the Arbiter&#x27;s backstory before the game&#x27;s events are explained in a tie-in graphic novel, &quot;Halo Wars: Genesis&quot;. The Elite, Ripa &#x27;Moramee, was given the rank after he fought and lost a campaign against his own clan. The Arbiter acts as the primary enemy of the game, charged with the destruction of humanity by the Prophet of Regret. He is ultimately killed by human forces at the game&#x27;s climax.

===Other appearances===
An Arbiter is depicted in &quot;Halo Legends&quot;, a collection of anime short films developed between 343 Industries and numerous Japanese animation studios; &quot;The Duel&quot; shows how the position of Arbiter was stripped of its prestige and influence.

An Arbiter makes a non-canon appearance as a guest playable character in &quot;Killer Instinct: Season Three&quot;, voiced by Ray Chase. He uses several weapons from the &quot;Halo&quot; series in combat, and fights in the Arena of Judgment, a stage set in the midst of a battle on Sanghelios. According to franchise development director Frank O&#x27;Connor, this character is an &quot;amalgam&quot; of historical characters.

Thel &#x27;Vadam also appears in several &quot;Halo&quot; novels, including &quot;Halo: First Strike&quot; and &quot;The Cole Protocol&quot;, the latter of which his name is first mentioned, which details his career before and during the events of &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; and &quot;Halo 2&quot;, prior to being named the Arbiter.

An Arbiter named Var &#x27;Gatanai leads the Covenant&#x27;s war against humanity in season two of the &quot;Halo&quot; TV series. In the season finale, he was defeated by the Master Chief in a vicious duel and then killed with his own energy sword by the Spartan.

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
Following the release of &quot;Halo 2&quot;, Joyride Studios released an Arbiter action figure. This particular model was reviewed by Armchair Empire&#x27;s Aaron Simmer as a &quot;great translation of the source material into plastic&quot;. Several models of the Arbiter are featured in the &quot;Halo ActionClix&quot; collectible game, produced as promotional material prior to the release of &quot;Halo 3&quot;. McFarlane Toys was given the task of developing a &quot;Halo 3&quot; line of action figures, and a sculpt of the Arbiter was released in the second series of figures after the game&#x27;s release in July 2008. A large-scale, non-articulated Arbiter figure was produced by McFarlane as part of the &quot;Legendary Collection&quot;. Other Arbiter merchandise includes MegaConstrux toys and Funko Pops.

===Critical reception===
The initial reception of the Arbiter as a playable character in &quot;Halo 2&quot; was mixed from fans and critics alike. O&#x27;Connor described the Arbiter as the most controversial character Bungie had ever created. Several publications enjoyed the added dimension to the Covenant by having the Arbiter as a playable character, and praised the added stealth gameplay and new story afforded by the character twist. Critics from &quot;The Artifice&quot; and &quot;The Escapist&quot; argued it was the Arbiter, not the Master Chief, who had a realized character arc in the game, and whose active participation made the ending of the game richer.

Alternatively, publications like &quot;GameSpot&quot; thought that while the Arbiter and Covenant side added &quot;newfound complexity to the story&quot;, it distracted the player from Earth&#x27;s fate. Reviewer Jarno Kokko said that while he did not personally dislike playing as the character, the idea of &quot;people disliking the concept of playing on the other side in a game that is supposed to be the &#x27;Master Chief blows up some alien scum&#x27; show&quot; was a plausible complaint. Among some fans, the character was reviled. A panel of &quot;Halo 2&quot; reviewers argued that though the decision to humanize the Covenant by the introduction of the Arbiter was welcome, the execution in-game was lacking; critics highlighted the perceived poor quality of the Arbiter&#x27;s missions compared to those played as the Master Chief. Looking back at the game&#x27;s release ten years later, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described players as having a &quot;love–hate relationship&quot; with the character, and that the furor over the twist was only overshadowed because of the controversy of the game&#x27;s cliffhanger ending.

The reception of the Arbiter&#x27;s elimination as a main playable character in &quot;Halo 3&quot; was similarly mixed. Hilary Goldstein of &quot;IGN&quot; decided the change took away the &quot;intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites&quot;, in the process reducing the character&#x27;s role to that of &quot;a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword&quot;. Likewise, Steve West of Cinemablend stated that the one important event in the game for the Arbiter would be lost on anyone for whom &quot;Halo 3&quot; was their first game in the series. Goldstein took issue with the poor artificial intelligence of allies in the game and singled out the Arbiter in particular, describing the character as useless. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Charles Herold found that in comparison to &quot;Halo 2&quot;, where the character played a central role, the Arbiter in &quot;Halo 3&quot; was &quot;extraneous&quot;. On the opposite end of the spectrum were reviewers like G4tv, who argued that the Arbiter was more likeable, not to mention more useful, as an AI sidekick instead of the main player. MSNBC rated the Arbiter one of game&#x27;s top alien characters, and &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; described the Arbiter&#x27;s reception as a transition from divisive character to fan favorite.

&quot;Halo Wars&quot;″s cinematics and voice acting were widely lauded, although one reviewer wrote that the characters were stereotypical and unlikeable. Dakota Grabowski of PlanetXbox360 considered the Arbiter the most confusing character in the game&#x27;s story. Conversely, &quot;GamePro&quot; described the Arbiter as one of the best things about the game, saying that while it was a different character than the Arbiter seen in &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Halo 3&quot;, he was &quot;like an alien Jack Bauer amped up on drugs&quot;.

Despite the resistance to the character, Bungie staff defended the character&#x27;s introduction. &quot;I&#x27;d much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine,&quot; said &quot;Halo 2&quot; design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game&#x27;s marketing and the actual gameplay. &quot;I think, even more so than playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth&#x27;s under siege, we&#x27;re going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that.&quot; Referring to &quot;Halo 2&quot;″s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, &quot;I think if we&#x27;d been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated.&quot;

Retrospective reviews on The Arbiter since Halo 2&#x27;s release have been more positive. In 2021, a &quot;Polygon&quot; article stated &quot;the Arbiter gives Master Chief a run for his money as &quot;badass video game protagonist&quot;, and he does it in only six missions.&quot; A piece in The Escapist stated &quot;Thel &#x27;Vadam is the only character in the Halo games with a proper character arc&quot; and &quot;All told then, more than 15 years after his introduction, the Arbiter continues to hold an uneasy but influential place in the Halo franchise. When he was introduced, he expanded the series&#x27;s scope with grand narrative ambition but some frustrating gameplay choices. When he was mothballed, that ambition seemed to leave with him.&quot;

<doc id="1193338" wikidata="Q315659" url="?curid=1193338" title="Yohannes IV">
<text>Yohannes IV (Tigrinya: ዮሓንስ ፬ይ &quot;Rabaiy Yōḥānnes&quot;; horse name Abba Bezbiz also known as Kahśsai; born &quot;Lij&quot; Kahssai Mercha; 11 July 1837 – 10 March 1889) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1871 to his death in 1889 at the Battle of Gallabat, and king of Tigray from 1869 to 1871. During his reign he successfully defended Ethiopia against a large-scale Egyptian invasion.

In his earlier years, he rebelled against Tewodros II; having risen to power in the 1860s, he maintained the policy of Tewodros, that of continued unification and also implemented a policy of touring entire regions and meetings with governors. He assisted the British in their British expedition to Abyssinia which ended in Tewodros&#x27; suicide, from which Yohannes was rewarded in ammunition and artillery. He regarded Islam as a hindrance to the stability of the state and worked to strengthen Christian dominance in Ethiopia. Its estimated that he had converted 550,000 Oromos and Jebertis to Christianity. In foreign policy, he had disagreements and military conflicts with both Isma&#x27;il Pasha of the Khedivate of Egypt and Muhammad Ahmad during the latter&#x27;s Mahdist War.

== Origin and early life ==
On the side of his father, Mercha Wolde Kidan, Yohannes descended from the ruling family of Tembien where both his father and grandfather bore the traditional title of &quot;šum Tembien&quot;, while his mother, Silas Dimtsu, was a daughter of &quot;balgäda&quot; Demtsu of Enderta and Tabotu Woldu of Agame, hence a niece of Sabagadis Woldu. He thus descended from the ruling families of Tembien, Agame, and Enderta. Yohannes Solomonic lineage is through his paternal grandmother Woizero Workewoha KaleKristoss of Adwa, the granddaughter of Ras Mikael Sehul and his wife Aster Iyasu, daughter of Empress Mentewab and Melmal Iyasu, who was a Solomonic prince and nephew of Emperor Bakaffa. Therefore Yohannes is descendent from the Gondar-Branch of the Solomonic Dynasty.

The story of the first half of his life is poorly documented. Even the date of his birth is uncertain; various sources place it between 1831 and 1837. The available sources merely indicate that he was the youngest of his siblings, that he had a seriously ailing childhood, that he received some church education, and that he was initiated to manhood after killing some wild animals (lions and/or elephants) for trophies. The first mention of his appearance in the political arena comes up in connection with his visit to the imperial court of Tewodros II in 1864–1865 in the company of his brothers, Gugsa and Maru. Gugsa was given the title of &quot;däjazmač&quot;, and Maru that of &quot;fit’awrari&quot;. The lowest title, of &quot;balambaras&quot;, was bestowed upon Kaśa, who was subsequently assigned to administer a sub-district within the governorship of his elder brother, Gugsa.

Shortly after their return to Tigray, Kaśa rebelled against the rule of Tewodros. What prompted his rebellion is not well established. Often two explanations, which are not essentially contradictory, are forwarded by the sources: the first is related to his dissatisfaction with the rank and function given to him by the sovereign, while the second interprets his rebellion as a response to the appeal of &quot;abunä&quot; Salama who in 1867 wrote from prison to many notables condemning his perceived injustices of Tewodros. In any case, for some time he (together with his followers) retired to the eastern lowlands and found refuge among the Afar, from which ethnic group he married a Muslim after she had been baptized with the name Tebaba Sellasie.

Returning to the highlands, he raised more men and began his military campaign: in the years 1864–1867, he consecutively defeated &quot;šum seraye&quot; Gebre Mikael, &quot;däjazmač&quot; Barya&#x27;u Gebre Sadeq of Adwa and &quot;däjazmač&quot; Tekle Giyorgis Qalos of Shire. Barya&#x27;u transferred his allegiance to Kaśa whom he served faithfully until he was killed in a battle some ten years later. Tekle Giyorgis (who had killed Kaśa&#x27;s mother, Silass) fell in battle, and Kaśa subsequently assumed his title of &quot;däjazmač&quot;. Kaśa then formed an alliance with &quot;wag šum&quot; Gobez Gebre Medhin of Lasta against Tewodros and began to harass the imperial representatives on both sides of the Mareb River. He defeated the governors of Selewa and Kilte Awulaelo. In Hamasien, &quot;däjazmač&quot; Haylu Tewolde Medhen, who contemplated resistance, was confined and replaced with &quot;däjazmač&quot; (later &quot;ras&quot;) Woldemichael Solomon who had actively participated in Kaśa&#x27;s military campaign against the imperial officials in Tigray.

== Rise to power ==
The imperial ambitions of Behaile Selassie are consolidated towards the end of the reign of Tewodros II; as early as 1867, he presented himself, during a correspondence with the British, as ruler of Ethiopia. During the same year, a diplomatic dispute between Tewodros and the British government led the expedition to Abyssinia in order to free the European captives imprisoned there by Tewodros. From February 1868, Yohannes came into contact with British officers, including the commander of the expedition, Sir Robert Napier, who sends Major James Augustus Grant, a British explorer, to meet the ruler of Tigray. Yohannes is then perceived by James as a “weak and easily manipulated man, aspiring to become a great leader of Ethiopia.&quot; After three hearings, Yohannes officially agrees to help Napier. This then facilitates the provisioning of the troops by installing markets near the main camp sites. Yohannes assures the British that he will help them “with all [his] power.&quot;

Yohannes undertakes to protect the supply routes from the coast to Magdala and to repress those who disturb the telegraph. In return, Yohannes asked Napier during a meeting on February 28, 1868, for the participation of British forces in his fight against Wagshum Gobeze. Napier refused but maintained the possibility, after the campaign, of military assistance which Yohannes and his 10,000 men greatly needed. On April 10, 1868, the expeditionary force arrived at the foot of Magdala and, three days later, after refusing to surrender to the British, the Nəgusä nägäst Tewodros II committed suicide. Napier&#x27;s victory and the ease with which the expedition reached Magdala was made possible by Yohannes. The British officers themselves admit that they were &quot;lucky&quot; to have obtained the cooperation of the leader of Tigray. A report written by one of the British officers stating that: “The British army could not have reached Magdala during this season, without having received the help of the chiefs and the people of the country”.

In return for the help that Yohannes provided the British, he received military equipment, estimated at 500,000 Pounds sterling, including: six mortars, six howitzers, approximately 900 muskets and rifles, ammunition, powder and 585,480 primers percussion. This armament is added to the already important arsenal of Yohannes. After the Magdala expedition, the British disengaged completely and Yohannes&#x27; offers of cooperation were rejected or ignored. Even after his seizure of imperial power, he failed to arouse the interest of the British. Nevertheless, the Napier expedition had an impact on the struggle for power; in addition to military equipment, a British instructor, John C. Kirkham, agrees to stay in Ethiopia to train the troops of Yohannes. He is responsible for training the troops of Yohannes and preparing them for the use of modern weapons received from the British. According to the Historian Bahru Zewde, the combination of new weapons and the training provided by John Kirkham determined the fight against Tekle Giyorgis.

Following the death of Tewodros, Gobeze Gebre Medhin, had himself crowned as &quot;nəgusä nägäst&quot; Tekle Giyorgis II. He successfully suppressed rebellions of &quot;ras&quot; Wolde Maryam of Begemender and Fares Ali of Yejju. Yohannes however, refused to acknowledge the new metropolitan &quot;abunä&quot; Atnatyos sent from Alexandria in June 1869, and kept him in his dominion. However, Tekle Giyorgis is not fooled and he quickly understands Yohannes&#x27; intentions. Although having a much larger army in numbers, Tekle Giyorgis does not have the modern weapons which Yohannes have. In addition to that, his troops include many soldiers from Tigray and he fears their change of camp in favor of Yohannes. Thus, Tekle Giyorgis seeks the collaboration of Menelik in order to consolidate a purely numerical advantage. However, the Negus of Shewa refuses to join in the fight, preferring to see the two great Warlords confront each other and tire each other. Finally, on 11 July 1871, Tekle Giyorgis confronted Kaśa in the Battle of Adwa, but was defeated and confined to Enda Abba Selma, Tembien, where he would die two years later.

== Internal policy ==

The principle of Yohannes&#x27;s internal policy was to continue the legacy of Tewodros II by trying to unite Ethiopia. To ensure the realization of this policy, he toured each region and meeting appointed governors, usually from the local nobility, regardless of their former attitudes toward him, as long as they submitted and expressed to him their unflinching loyalty. He thus managed, as the contemporary English vice-consul put it, &quot;to hold the scales of justice with a firm and even hand&quot;; &quot;it was in 1884 the boast of King Yohannes that a child could pass through his dominions unharmed&quot;. In the first six years of his reign, he succeeded in achieving the unity of the predominantly Christian provinces, including Wag and Lasta, Semien and Begemder, Sayint, Gojjam, Wollo and Shewa. He crowned Menelik King of Shewa in 1878 and Tekle Haymanot King of Gojjam and Kaffa in 1881 and encouraged them to expand their empire to the south, east, and west. However, this advice created rivalry between the two regional kings, which came to a climax in the Battle of Embabo in June 1882. Yohannes reprimanded both of them for fighting without his permission, punished them by taking away a province from the jurisdiction of each of them and defined the direction of territories to be conquered by each of the two kings.
When Yohannes was crowned emperor he established his capital in Debre Tabor which was his seat for a decade before he shifted the capital in 1881 to Mekelle, but he still retained Debre Tabor as his primary residence.

=== Religious policy ===
Yohannes inherited the empire encumbered with three religious questions which provoked him to seek a solution: the internal dissensions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOC), Islam, and Christian foreign missionary activities. He regarded all of them as menaces to the unity and stability of the state.

By 1878, Yohannes was ready to tackle the problems by summoning a council at Boru Meda, Wollo. Most of the high dignitaries and notables of Ethiopia were present at the council. The leading theologians of the three major disputing groups of the EOC — &quot;Karra&quot; (predominant in the north), &quot;Sägga&quot; or &quot;Śost Lədät&quot; (prevalent in Begemeder and Shewa) and &quot;Qəbat&quot; (based in Gojjam and Lasta) — tried to defend their respective doctrines. Yohannes readily accepted corrections made by a notable on procedural matters. Apparently, he had a long-prepared plan for the council, as he had a letter from the patriarch of Alexandria read out at the end of the disputation which endorsed the imperial tenet. The policy transcended Yohannes&#x27;s reign, though there were indications that the suppressed tenets had by no means been eradicated. Any &quot;Śost Lədät&quot; supporters who protested the council had their tongues cut out.

Yohannes was known to harbor deep resentment towards Islam, a Sudanese official was reported stating &quot;Yohannes is the most hateful of the Abyssinians towards Islam. Someone who knew him told me that if he saw a Muslim in the morning it would depress him so that he would immediately take the cross which he worships and put it over his face.&quot; During the council at Boru Meda, he summoned the major Oromo chiefs of Wollo. According to an Ethiopian chronicler, Yohannes told them: 

It is estimated that by 1880 some 50,000 Jebertis (Tigrinya speaking Muslims) and 500,000 Oromos had been forced to convert to Christianity from Islam.

==Foreign policy ==
===War with Ottoman Egypt===
Throughout his reign, Yohannes was embroiled in military struggles on his northern frontiers. First was from Khedive Isma&#x27;il Pasha of Egypt, who sought to bring the entire Nile River basin under his rule. The Egyptians flirted with encouraging Menelik of Shewa against the King, but earned Menelik&#x27;s enmity by marching from the port of Zeila and occupying the city-state of Harar on 11 October 1875. Both Menelik and Yohannes had regarded Harar as a renegade province of Ethiopia, and Egyptian seizure of the Emirate was not welcomed to either of them. The Egyptians then marched into northern Ethiopia from their coastal possessions around the port of Massawa. Yohannes pleaded with the British to stop their Egyptian allies and even withdrew from his own territory in order to show the Europeans that he was the wronged party and that the Khedive was the aggressor. However, Yohannes soon realized that the Europeans would not stop the Khedive of Egypt and so he gathered up his armies and marched to meet the Egyptian force.

The two armies met at Gundet (also called Guda-gude) on the morning of 16 November 1875. The Egyptians were tricked into marching into a narrow and steep valley and were wiped out by Ethiopian gunners surrounding the valley from the surrounding mountains. Virtually the entire Egyptian force, along with its many officers of European and North American background, were killed. News of this huge defeat was suppressed in Egypt for fear that it would undermine the government of the Khedive. A new Egyptian force was assembled and sent to avenge the defeat at Gundet. The Egyptians were defeated again at the Battle of Gura (7–9 March 1876), where the Ethiopians were led again by the Emperor, and his loyal general, the capable (and future &quot;Ras&quot;) Alula Engida. This victory was followed by Menelik&#x27;s submission to Yohannes on 20 March 1878, and in return, Yohannes recognized Menelik&#x27;s hereditary right to the title of King (&quot;Negus&quot;) of Shewa, and re-crowned him on 26 March. Yohannes took this opportunity to tie the Shewan King more closely to him by arranging for Menelik&#x27;s daughter Zewditu (the future Empress of Ethiopia in her own right), to be married to his own son and heir, &quot;Ras&quot; Araya Selassie. Victor of the Egyptian-Ethiopian War and undisputed Neguse Negest, in 1878 Yohannes was at the high point of his reign. (See Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles).

Emperor Yohannes also convened a general council of the Ethiopian Church at Boru Meda later in 1878, which brought an end to the ongoing theological dispute in the local church; Christians, Muslims, and pagans were given respectively two, three and five years to conform to the council&#x27;s decisions. Non-Christians were forbidden from participating in the government unless they converted and were baptized; the Muslims were given three months, while the pagans had to become Christians immediately. &quot;Having concluded that Wollo was worth a mass,&quot; as Harold Marcus wryly puts it, his retainer &quot;Ras&quot; Mohammed of Wollo became disobedient of the tax rules, which he and the entire Wollo refused to pay tax to the government in which Emperor Yohannes had discovered, &quot;Ras&quot; Mohammed was conspiring with the Turks the Ottoman empire because of his Muslim affiliation. &quot;Ras&quot; Mohammed was brought to Emperor Yohannes and was confronted of his conspiracy in helping the Muslim colonizer and to bring down the Judeo Christian empire. &quot;Ras&quot; Mohammed was siding with Muslim Affiliates of Turkey. After meeting with King Yohannes and in learning that if he were to assist the Turks, in the end, he and the rest of Ethiopia would become a slave to the Arab/Muslim world. &quot;Ras Mohammed&quot; then chose to become a Christian to later inherit a Christian name (later &quot;Negus&quot;) Mikael of Wollo, the Emperor stood as his godfather at his baptism. The new convert was given Menelik of Shewa&#x27;s other daughter, Shewarega Menelik, as his wife. Yohannes went one step further and pressured Menelik to expel all of the Roman Catholic missionaries from Shewa. However this time, instead of a single Archbishop, he requested that Patriarch Cyril send four to serve the large number of Christians in Ethiopia, who arrived in 1881. They were led by &quot;Abuna&quot; Petros as Archbishop, &quot;Abuna&quot; Matewos for Shewa, &quot;Abuna&quot; Luqas for Gojjam and &quot;Abuna&quot; Markos for Gondar. &quot;Abuna&quot; Markos died shortly after arriving, so his diocese was included with that of &quot;Abuna&quot; Atnatewos. It was the first time that the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria had appointed four Bishops for Ethiopia.

===War with Sudan===
When Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed himself the Mahdi (a prophesied Islamic leader who would precede the Day of Judgement), and incited Turkish Sudan into a long and violent revolt, his followers successfully drove part of the Egyptian garrisons out of Sudan and isolated the rest at Suakin and at various posts in the south. Yohannes agreed to British requests to allow these Egyptian soldiers to evacuate through his lands, with the understanding that the British Empire would then support his claims on important ports like Massawa on the Red Sea to import weapons and ammunition in the event that Egypt was forced to withdraw from them. This was formalized in a treaty signed with the British at Adwa known as the Hewett Treaty. According to the treaty, the Ethiopians would allow the Egyptians to safely evacuate out of certain cities such as Kassala, which aggravated the Mahdists even more. &quot;Ras&quot; Alula Engida defeated an invading Mahdist army at the Battle of Kufit on 23 September 1885. About the same time, Italy took control of the port of Massawa, frustrating Ethiopian hopes and angering Yohannes.

Yohannes attempted to work out some kind of understanding with the Italians, so he could turn his attention to the more pressing problem of the Mahdists, although &quot;Ras&quot; Alula took it upon himself to attack Italian units that were on both sides of the ill-defined frontier between the two powers. Domestic problems increased when the Neguses of both Gojjam and Shewa rebelled against Yohannes, and the Emperor had to turn his attention from the encroaching Italians to deal with his rebellious vassals. Yohannes brutally crushed the Gojjame rebellion, but before he could turn his attention to Shewa news arrived that the Mahdist forces had sacked Gondar and burned its holy churches. He marched north from Gojjam to confront the armies of the Mahdi.

==Death==
Yohannes was killed by the Mahdists at the Battle of Gallabat that took place on 9–10 March 1889 in Metemma near the Sudanese border. Evidence suggests that Emperor Yohannes had acted rashly and had made himself vulnerable, going beyond enemy lines in a range of enemy shots as victory was going to his side. Mortally wounded from a gunshot. Reportedly, the Emperor sustained two gunshot wounds: the first, a rifle shot to his arm, and shortly thereafter, a severe gunshot to his chest. Subsequently, he was transported to his tent, where he revealed that his nephew, Ras Mengesha, was in fact his biological son and declared him as his heir (his elder son &quot;Ras&quot; Araya Selassie had died a few years earlier). He died hours later. Although the Ethiopian army had almost annihilated their opponents in this battle, hearing that their ruler had been slain shattered their morale and they were scattered by the nearly beaten Sudanese army.

Yohannes&#x27;s body was carried back to Tigray guarded by a small party, who were overtaken by the Mahdist troops of Zeki Tummal near the Atbara River, who captured the sovereign&#x27;s body. Augustus B. Wylde, who claimed to have heard the story from a priest who managed to escape the slaughter, wrote how Yohannes&#x27; uncle &quot;Ras&quot; Araya Dimtsu stood beside the body of his dead master with &quot;a few of his soldiers and the bravest of the king&#x27;s servants, who had lost their all, and had no more prospects to live for&quot;.
: &quot;Ras&quot; Araya was last seen standing alongside the box containing the king&#x27;s body, after having expended all his ammunition, with his shield and sword in his hands, defending himself, till at last he was speared by a Dervish from behind, and died fighting gamely, &quot;like the fine old warrior that he was&quot;.

According to Wylde, as he saw death come &quot;Ras&quot; Araya announced &quot;that he was now old and done for, that his time had come, and it was useless at his age to serve another master that he knew little about, and it was better to die like a man fighting unbelievers, than like a mule in a stable.&quot; The Mahdists brought the Emperor&#x27;s body back to their capital at Omdurman, where the head was put on a pike and paraded through the streets.

On 2 May of the same year 1889, Emperor Menelik signed then the Treaty of Wuchale with the Italians which later on led to the Battle of Adwa.

== Descendants ==
Although a group of Tigrean nobles led by &quot;Ras&quot; Alula attempted to promote the claim of &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha Yohannes (the &quot;natural&quot; son of Yohannes) as Emperor, many of the dead monarch&#x27;s other relatives on both the Enderta and Tembien sides of his family objected and went into open rebellion against Mengesha. Many refused to accept &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha as the son of Yohannes, having long known him as his nephew. Tigray was torn assunder by the rebellions of various members of the Emperor&#x27;s family against Mengesha and each other. Menelik of Shewa took advantage of Tigrean disorder, and after the Italians occupied Hamasien, (a district Yohannes IV had bestowed upon &quot;Ras&quot; Alula) he was proclaimed Emperor of Ethiopia as Menelik II. The death of Yohannes reduced the influence of Tigrayans in the Ethiopian government and opened the way for Italians to occupy more districts previously held by Tigrayan nobles. The seizures made by the Italians at this time ultimately resulted in the creation of the colony of Eritrea and the defeat of Italy at the Battle of Adwa at the hands of Emperor Menelik II. The Tigrean nobility retained influence at the Imperial court of Menelik and his successors, although not at the level they enjoyed under Yohannes IV. The descendants of Yohannes ruled Tigray as hereditary Princes until the Ethiopian Revolution and the fall of the monarchy in 1974 ended their rule.

===Araya Selassie Yohannes===
There are two lines of descent from Yohannes IV, one &quot;legitimate&quot; and one &quot;natural.&quot; The legitimate line is through his elder son, &quot;Ras&quot; Araya Selassie Yohannes. Araya Selassie Yohannes was born to his wife Wolete Selassie. The son of Araya Selassie Yohannes was &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Araya Selassie. His son was the infamous &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Haile Selassie Gugsa who governed eastern Tigray in the 1930s and was married to Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s daughter Princess Zenebework Haile Selassie. However, following the death of his wife, &quot;Dejazmatch&quot; Haile Selassie Gugsa&#x27;s relationship with Emperor Haile Selassie deteriorated, and in 1936, &quot;Dejazmatch&quot; Haile Selassie became the first high-ranking Ethiopian nobleman to defect to the Italians when the Fascist forces invaded Ethiopia. The people of Mekelle ransacked his house when this news was revealed. He was elevated to the title of &quot;Ras&quot; by the King of Italy. However, following the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, Haile Selassie Gugsa was placed under house arrest and regarded as a traitor. Emperor Haile Selassie refused to acknowledge the title of &quot;Ras&quot; granted to his former son-in-law by the King of Italy, and so he reverted to the title of &quot;Dejazmatch&quot;. He was freed by the Derg regime in 1974 following the fall of the monarchy. He died shortly thereafter. There are other descendants of Emperor Yohannes IV in this &quot;legitimate&quot; line, but because of the wartime actions of &quot;Dejazmatch&quot; Haile Selassie Gugsa, this branch of the family fell into disfavor at the Imperial court and lost its position and influence.

===Mengesha Yohannes===
The second, &quot;natural&quot; line is through &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha Yohannes and is the better-known line. Although &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha Yohannes ended his days under house arrest for his repeated rebelling against Emperor Menelik II. Ras Mengesha&#x27;s son &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum Mengesha first became governor of western Tigray, and following the treason of his cousin &quot;Dejazmatch&quot; Haile Selassie Gugsa, became Governor (&quot;Shum&quot;) of all of Tigray in 1936. He commanded troops against the Italians, but was forced to surrender and spent most of the Italian occupation under house arrest in Addis Ababa. Following the return of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1941, &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum was restored to his governorate of Tigray, recognized as the hereditary Prince of that province. &quot;Ras&quot; Seyoum Mengesha was killed during the abortive coup by the Imperial Bodyguard in 1960 and was succeeded by his son &quot;Ras&quot; Mengesha Seyoum who served as Governor and hereditary Prince of Tigray until the 1974 Revolution toppled the Ethiopian monarchy. Ras Mengesha Seyoum is married to Princess Aida Desta, a granddaughter of Emperor Haile Selassie and is the current head of the Tigrean branch of the Solomonic dynasty. Mengesha Seyum is the last person alive today who bears the title of &quot;Leul Ras&quot;.

==Legacy==

Yohannes undoubtedly had his weaknesses; they were not his own making, but rather imposed on him either by external pressure or inherited by his deep-seated values and traditional norms. During the eighteen years of his reign, he was preoccupied with defending his country against external aggressions perpetrated by the Egyptians, the Italians, and the Mahdists. Yohannes succeeded to a large extent in pacifying the country and expanding the empire by the device of power-sharing and accommodation. Guiding principles of his administration were patience, tolerance, and forgiveness, as well as a tendency to preserve the status quo. Above all, his concerns were focused on promoting peace rather than his own personal or dynastic gain.

The way he shared his authority with Menelik and Tekle Haymanot eventually resulted in undermining his own authority, but it contributed greatly to accelerating the process of reunification of the Ethiopian Empire. By preserving the status quo in the regional administration, the uncertainty and fear which were prevalent under previous reigns due to constant changes were reduced. The self-confidence and charitable attitude he displayed toward his vanquished enemies and rivals earned him the high esteem of his subjects.

Early in his career after he defeated and seized &quot;Dejazmatch&quot; Gabre Mikael of Seraye, who was responsible for the death of his own mother Woizero Silas Dimtsu, not only did he forgive him, but within a year, Gabre Mikael was reinstated as councilor and appeared as one of the important dignitaries during the mission of Major Grant to Adwa, in February 1868. Subsequently, Gabre Mikael&#x27;s son, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Birru, also held important posts. &quot;Ras&quot; Adal of Gojjam, after he killed his own cousin, &quot;Ras&quot; Desta Tedla Gualu, the newly appointed governor by Yohannes and submitted to Yohannes and asked for forgiveness, not only was he forgiven but he was given the command over Gojjam and eventually elevated as King of Gojjam and Keffa, under the name of Tekle Haymanot.

King Menelik&#x27;s ambition to seize the imperial crown was clearly evident since his escape from Mäqdalä and return to Shoa, in 1865. The submission of Menelik to Yohannes was not effected until 1878 after Yohannes gained substantial advantage over his rivals in terms of quality and quantity of firearms as a result of the booty gathered in his successive victories over the Egyptian army at Gundet and Gurae, in 1875 and 1876, respectively. This advantage remained on Yohannes&#x27;s side throughout his reign. Despite repeated pressure from his advisers on two occasions, in 1878, at the time of Menelik&#x27;s submission and in 1881, after his two vassal kings, Menelik and Teklé Haymanot fought against each other at Embabo, to remove Menelik and replace him if need be, by one of his cousins, such as Meshesha Seifu, Yohannes refused to yield on grounds that he was not going to destroy an effective power, which Menelik diligently built up for the sake of eliminating a possible threat to himself. Finally, Yohannes heard that both his vassal kings have defected and during his campaign in Gojjam, Tekle Haymant confessed that they had concluded an agreement to help one another and rebel against the authority of the Emperor. At this juncture, the temptation was great to cross the Abbay River (Blue Nile) to Showan territory and eliminate the internal threat. Yohannes&#x27;s priority, however, was to avert the external threat and he decided to face the Mahdists who had penetrated twice as far as Gonder and burnt the churches, pillaged the country, and enslaved people.

Throughout his reign, Yohannes demonstrated selfless devotion to the defense of the territorial integrity of Ethiopian Empire against successive waves of external aggression, by Egyptians, Italians, and Mahdists Sudan. He also strove within the parameters of what was possible in his day to promote the welfare of his people. His devotion to his country and people culminated in the supreme sacrifice of his life at the border of his empire, in the Battle of Metemma.

<text>Donna Marie Upson (born 1978) is a Canadian white supremacist who ran for the office of mayor of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in the 2003 municipal election.

In July 2000, Upson, known within the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) as &quot;Baby Hitler&quot;, with several previous convictions for hate-related offences, was sentenced to two years in prison for threatening the pastor of a predominantly black Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, congregation. The judge stated that Upson had come to Nova Scotia on a mission to rid churches of blacks, and she was described as a &quot;card-carrying member of the KKK, Aryan Nations, and the Nationalist Party&quot;.

She appealed her three convictions, and, in May 2001, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal reversed two of them, and she was then released from prison. She was re-arrested a few days later, on an Amherst warrant, to face assault charges stemming from incidents while she was incarcerated; she was then released on bail.

In July 2003, there was wide coverage in Canadian media that Upson had filed as a candidate for mayor of Ottawa. During the campaign, she received contributions from the KKK, and she voiced support for racial segregation. She had also set up a Canadian branch of the National Socialist Movement. A week after the original coverage, it was reported that there were three outstanding arrest warrants for Upson from Nova Scotia, two for assault and one for failure to appear.

Arrested in October for breach of probation, she remained on the ballot for the November 10, 2003 election and finished sixth, with 1,312 votes (0.71%), considered a &quot;startling number&quot;.

<doc id="1193348" wikidata="Q26450" url="?curid=1193348" title="Join Me in Death">
<text>&quot;Join Me in Death&quot; is a single by Finnish gothic rock band HIM, taken from their second studio album, &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; (2000). It was also released under the condensed title of &quot;Join Me&quot;. The song is the eighth-best-selling single of all time in Finland.

==Overview==
HIM performed this song for the first time in Ilosaarirock, Finland, on 11 July 1998, which featured an extra verse not included in the studio versions.

The song has been met with controversy regarding its subject matter. &quot;A couple of people blamed me for a suicide someone committed over here saying that &#x27;Join Me&#x27; is an invitation to kill yourself,&quot; HIM frontman Ville Valo told the European magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; in 2003. &quot;What I was trying to do was sort of rip-off &#x27;Don&#x27;t Fear the Reaper&#x27; by Blue Öyster Cult, making a rock track of &quot;Romeo And Juliet&quot;.&quot; Lyrics such as &quot;Would you die tonight for love?&quot; have contributed to the misconception that the song is about suicide, which Valo denies, claiming the lyrics refer to giving things up for the sake of love. &quot;It&#x27;s not about suicide, that song. It&#x27;s about giving it all away,&quot; Valo told the magazine &quot;Modern Fix&quot;.

Four versions of the song&#x27;s video exist: three &quot;lazer versions&quot;, two of which include different scenes from the movie The Thirteenth Floor, and the fourth being an &quot;ice version&quot;, with a vague &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; theme also attributed to the song.

&quot;Join Me In Death&quot; was included in the film &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot; (though not on its soundtrack) and on the &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; soundtrack in 2004. The band Gregorian covered &quot;Join Me&quot; with Sarah Brightman on their album &quot;Masters of Chant: Chapter III&quot; and on Brightman&#x27;s Limited Edition &quot;The Harem Tour&quot; album. Another Gregorian version exists with vocals performed by Amelia Brightman.

<doc id="1193350" wikidata="Q332927" url="?curid=1193350" title="Edward FitzRoy">
<text>Edward Algernon FitzRoy (24 July 1869 – 3 March 1943) was a British Conservative politician who served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1928 until his death in 1943.

==Early life==
FitzRoy was the second son of the 3rd Baron Southampton and his second wife, Ismania Catherine Nugent, a granddaughter of Sir Charles Jenkinson, 10th Baronet. He came from a family with a long line of public service and was a descendant of Charles II&#x27;s illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton. Through ancestor Anne Warren, the daughter of Admiral Peter Warren, he was a descendant of the Schuyler family, the Van Cortlandt family, and the Delancey family, all from British North America.

His mother was Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria and young FitzRoy was a Page of Honour to the Queen.

==Political career==
A member of Northamptonshire County Council from 1896 to 1921, FitzRoy first entered Parliament in 1900 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Northamptonshire South. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire in 1901. He was re-elected during the January 1910 general election for Northamptonshire South. He held the seat in the December 1910 general election.

During World War I, whilst still an MP, he served in the British Army as a captain of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards, was wounded at the First Battle of Ypres and commanded the mounted troops of the Guards Division from 1915–16.

In the 1918 general election, he was elected for the seat of Daventry. He held the seat in the 1922, 1923, 1924, 1929, 1931 and 1935 general elections.

He served as deputy chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, briefly during 1923 and from 1924 to 1928. He was made a Privy Councillor in February 1924. He was elected Speaker of the House of Commons on 20 June 1928. In 1931, he was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Cambridge and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford in 1934. In 1935, there was considerable controversy when the Labour Party decided to stand a candidate against him in the general election. According to &quot;The Times&quot;″ obituary, &quot;In addition to his former party Mr. Lloyd George and the Liberal leaders came out strongly in defence of his position. Even on the lowest ground of party interest Labour made a grave mistake, for Captain FitzRoy was returned by a resounding majority.&quot;

Fitzroy died in office, aged 73 in Westminster in 1943. He was succeeded by Douglas Clifton-Brown. In 1983, Labour MP and then Father of the House John Parker paid a humorous tribute to him: &quot;I remember the first Speaker in my time, Captain Fitzroy. He was definitely a bit of a tartar. He disliked new young Members. When he was in the Chair, if someone spoke for too long he banged his hand on the side of his Chair. The longer the Member continued to speak, the more vigorously he hit the Chair. Everyone saw that except, unfortunately, the Member who was speaking, who was not deterred. Captain Fitzroy took a firm revenge and did not call that Member for a long time.&quot; Parker also reported, &quot;Captain Fitzroy once told me that, as a descendant of Barbara Villiers and Charles II, the most embarrassing thing that he had had to do in the House was to announce the abdication of Edward VIII. He found that awkward and embarrassing&quot;.

==Personal life==
FitzRoy married Muriel Douglas-Pennant on 19 November 1891. She was appointed a CBE in 1918. Upon his death she was given a Viscountcy, the customary retirement honour for Speakers, as Viscountess Daventry.

Fitzroy and Lady Daventry had four children:

* Robert Oliver Fitzroy, 2nd Viscount Daventry (10 January 1893 – 1986)
* Hon. Nancy Jean Fitzroy (31 May 1894 – 23 November 1983)
* Captain Michael Algernon Fitzroy (27 June 1895 15 April 1915)
* Commander Hon. John Maurice FitzRoy Newdegate (20 March 1897 – 7 May 1976), father of Francis FitzRoy Newdegate, 3rd Viscount Daventry

==Arms==
Fitzroy&#x27;s arms, as displayed in Speaker&#x27;s House were the same as those of the Dukes of Grafton.

<text>Anders Sigurd Lange (5 September 1904 – 18 October 1974) was a Norwegian political organiser, speaker and editor who led his eponymously named political party Anders Lange&#x27;s Party into the Storting (Norwegian parliament) in 1973.

Educated as a forestry technician, Lange got involved in politics following his stay in Argentina in the late 1920s. He joined the right-wing Fatherland League organisation upon his return to Norway in 1929, and he became a popular speaker at public rallies. His provocative style however often led to controversies. Although his agitation was chiefly directed against the political left, he also rejected the efforts of the far-right. He left the organisation in 1938 to join &quot;Landsforeningen Norges Sjøforsvar&quot;, where he agitated for strengthening the Norwegian armed forces and warned against the future world war. He was initially blocked from entering the organised Norwegian resistance during the Second World War, but nonetheless did work to assist resistance members, and he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned twice.

After the war, Lange initially focused on his work as a kennel-owner, as well as to write and publish his own dog-owner&#x27;s paper. Although he had pledged to not enter politics again, he became increasingly politically active. He started touring the country to speak at his public rallies, and the paper he published became increasingly political. He was a charismatic right-wing public speaker who first and foremost objected to high taxes, state-regulations and public bureaucracy. He gained a considerable following among youth in the 1960s, and their activities included to counter-demonstrate against left-wing demonstrations. Increasingly called upon by his supporters to establish a new political party, it was not until 1973 that he finally agreed to do so. The new party, named Anders Lange&#x27;s Party (ALP) was founded by popular acclamation during a public meeting at &quot;Saga kino&quot;. He successfully entered the Norwegian Parliament after the election later the same year, but his new-found political career came to an abrupt end when he died the following year. Lange&#x27;s political party was reformed and renamed to the Progress Party after his death.

==Early life==

Anders Sigurd Lange was born in Nordstrand, Aker (now a part of Oslo) to doctor Alf Lange (1869–1929) and Anna Elisabeth Svensson (1873–1955). He had two older siblings, Alexander and Karen. Although he was born in Aker, the family moved to Foss in Bjelland when he was only six weeks old, owing to his father being appointed district physician for a region consisting of Bjelland, Grindheim and Åseral. The Lange family was originally from Holstein and Denmark, and included several prominent public officials, priests, doctors and businessmen. Lange lived in Foss for his first seven years. Lange&#x27;s parents were divorced in 1911, and Anna Elisabeth moved to Bergen with her three children. They lived in humble conditions in a guest house in Fjøsanger for the first two to three years. The family thereafter moved to Kristiania (now named Oslo), settling in Skillebekk.
Lange started his secondary education at Vestheim School in 1921, but failed to graduate examen artium. He subsequently moved to Kristiansand in 1923, and finished his education at Kristiansand Cathedral School in 1924. He was not interested in politics in his youth, spending his free time in outdoor recreation and sports. In Kristiania (Oslo), Lange had played football and ice hockey for the club Mercantile SFK, and he continued to play football for FK Donn in Kristiansand. He broke his nose several times during play, giving him his characteristic crooked nose. Lange held his first public speech (albeit a short one), the Kristiansand russ speech, on 17 May 1924 in honour of Henrik Wergeland. He thereafter served in the Royal Guards for his conscription service.

During his time in the military, Lange became interested in forestry after reading the 1923 book &quot;Skogen og folket&quot; by Christian Gierløff. He graduated as a forestry technician at the Oddernes forestry school in 1926. He had part of his practice in Andebu, and after graduating he continued working there for a local farmer. A cousin of his father later tipped him that he could get work at a forestry school in Argentina, and Lange set out for the country in 1927. He went to port in Buenos Aires, got in connection with Kristiansand-based Norwegians, and travelled north to Tartagal near the border to Paraguay. He became engaged with the Saco company, and headed a work team of 15 men. Lange had also brought with him football equipment to the country, and he became known by the locals as &quot;Don André&quot;. Lange lived in Argentina from November 1927 to June 1929, when he went home with his father&#x27;s casket, his father having died of a heart attack when visiting Lange at his office in Argentina.

== Political career ==

===Interwar period===
Lange began his political career in the Norwegian right-wing Fatherland League organisation, which had been founded in 1925 by prominent figures such as Christian Michelsen and Fridtjof Nansen. Lange received a letter from writer Olaf Benneche, supplemented with a letter from Nansen requesting him to come back to Norway and join the anti-communist movement, and he was invited to Nansen&#x27;s property Polhøiden. According to Lange himself, it was communism that shaped his views. He had read about communism since his youth, and concluded that it was a &quot;poison&quot; that would destroy humans, take away their liberties and relinquish the independence of nations. Lange had also noted the stark political conflicts in Argentina during his stay in the country. His experience as an emigrant had led him to debunk what he saw as the left&#x27;s negative view of patriotism (&quot;fedrelandskjærlighet&quot;). The growth of the left-wing labour movement at the same time caused a polarisation of Norwegian politics, and the Fatherland League&#x27;s stated aim was to unite the political right against left-wing revolutionaries. Lange became secretary of the Fatherland League&#x27;s Agder branch in 1929, and marked himself in the first year by writing op-eds in newspapers and speaking at public rallies.
In early 1933, when Vidkun Quisling was Defence Minister, Lange was scheduled to host him at a public rally that was endorsed by the Agrarian Party (of which Quisling was a member at the time). The event led Lange to get a complete distaste of him. Lange was set to drive Quisling to the rally, and already when they met Lange noted that Quisling seemed &quot;as distracted as a St. Bernard,&quot; and that his handshake was &quot;as limp as a sponge.&quot; Quisling did reportedly not say a single word during the five-mile drive to the rally, and his speech was a disaster due to his failure to speak audibly (he would not use a microphone). At the Fatherland League&#x27;s subsequent national convention in 1933, a faction sought to tie the organisation closer to Quisling&#x27;s then-newly founded party, but Lange loudly opposed the proposal and attacked Quisling as &quot;the worst Defence Minister this country has ever had.&quot; Quisling left the Fatherland League following the convention. Although accused by the left of fascism, Lange distanced himself from the ideology, and instead considered it to &quot;live on&quot; through socialism and trade unions.

Lange&#x27;s later activities consisted mainly of holding public rallies, and his provocative style often got him into physical altercations with left-wing labour activists. His most controversial stunt was in 1935, when he sought to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the Labour Party&#x27;s attitude towards the existing society. Inspired by an earlier stunt of the Labour Party&#x27;s youth organisation (AUF), Lange demonstratively stood above a volunteer soaked in pig&#x27;s blood, lying over a truck, and &quot;threatening&quot; him with a hammer. The stunt led to clashes with AUF activists (Lange eventually broke his jaw), and as Lange&#x27;s stunt had not been approved by neither the Fatherland League&#x27;s local branch nor its central leadership, Lange was transferred to Oslo. He then held the position as national leader of the Fatherland League&#x27;s youth organisation from 1935 to 1936. Lange was considered a great speaker, and his rhetoric changed between being largely gentle or more vulgar. During a 1935 speech, Lange warned against both socialism and Nazism, often alleging the &quot;dictatorial tendencies&quot; he saw in the Labour Party. He in turn criticised Norway for being &quot;ripe for dictatorship,&quot; owing to Norwegians having &quot;stopped thinking&quot; and uncritically accepted &quot;supervisory boards, editorials, propaganda and dozy parliamentarians.&quot; Lange travelled through most of the country to hold speeches, including Northern Norway.

Lange left the Fatherland League at the end of 1938, and joined &quot;Landsforeningen Norges Sjøforsvar&quot; (&quot;Country Confederation for the Naval Defense of Norway&quot;) as its general secretary. The organisation&#x27;s purpose was to inform about the importance for Norway of the sea, and thus of the Norwegian navy. Lange continued to travel around the country in order to show films and hold speeches. He agitated for strengthening the Norwegian Armed Forces, and increasingly warned against a possible world war, and how Norway could be pulled into it. Lange was dejected that the authorities did not take him seriously, and left-wing activists continued to disturb his meetings. He showed up at the last meeting of the organisation on 6 or 7 April 1940 with a Krag-Jørgensen rifle, telling the audience to &quot;get ready for war,&quot; and asking rhetorically when Norway would arm its forces. Lange travelled to the Norwegian Parliament on 8 April 1940, and begged Labour Party MP Torvald Haavardstad to mobilise the Norwegian army. Haavardstad in turn responded that Lange should quit &quot;this hysterical defence talk.&quot;

===Second World War===
On 9 April 1940, Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany. Part of the background for Lange&#x27;s predictions about the future war was the letters he sent to several foreign heads of state, including Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler. He asked in a letter what Hitler&#x27;s plans were with his &quot;Third Reich&quot;, and received response from German authorities that &quot;Nazi Germany will triumph on all fronts.&quot; Lange had several Jewish friends, and considered their situation to be under such threat in 1939/40 that he thought they should escape before a German invasion of Norway. He managed to reserve 100 seats on the Norwegian America Line for Jews to escape, but none of the seats were taken. Lange and several of his friends from the Fatherland League were eager to join the resistance forces of the Norwegian Campaign, and they set out to Nordmarka on skis on 10 April. Lange had with him a machine gun and 1,000 bullets, but was forced to turn his weapon in when they met other resistance members. He was considered to be &quot;not reliable&quot; on account of his time in the Fatherland League, and he was left to ski back to Oslo. Lange became dejected and bitter as a result of his treatment, and he was left to think that the Labour Party, which he had criticised for not arming the defence before the invasion, had now also taken over control of Nordmarka.

Lange was imprisoned at Møllergata 19 in September 1940 for getting into a fight at Theatercaféen with Eyvind Mehle, an associate of Vidkun Quisling. The incident happened the day after Mehle had attacked King Haakon VII in a speech. Lange refused to greet Mehle when he came past his table, responding that &quot;I don&#x27;t greet Norway&#x27;s greatest turd in another way than this,&quot; and then slapped Mehle in the face. Lange thereafter grabbed Mehle and threw him through a door twice. Lange refused to apologise to Mehle, and was captured by German police the following day. Lange was imprisoned for four months, and was released in early 1941. His house was searched several times by the Gestapo when he was in prison. On other occasions, Lange and his family also hid Norwegians who planned to escape to Sweden in their house. Following his release from prison, Lange assisted resistance members with information work. He thus came under investigation by the police, as he was &quot;known for being an opponent of NS.&quot; In 1942 he was captured and imprisoned once more at Møllergata 19 after his house was raided by German police. It was during his times in prison that Lange started thinking seriously about practical politics. He was according to himself not tortured or abused in prison, but to his satisfaction he was left alone to just read books and think.

===Postwar years===
For the 1945 parliamentary election, Lange was offered to run for election by the Conservative Party, the Agrarian Party and the Labour Party, but he turned the offers down. Lange instead started working as the secretary of &quot;Norsk Kennel Klubb&quot;, a Norwegian dog-owner&#x27;s club. He was also hired as a columnist in &quot;Morgenbladet&quot;, writing about the dog community every Monday. Lange moved to Svartskog, Oppegård with his family in late 1946, where he started working to establish a kennel. He thereafter quit his engagement for &quot;Morgenbladet&quot; as he started his own paper instead, &quot;Hundeavisen&quot; (lit. &quot;dog paper&quot;). At the time, there were no independent publications such as this for the dog community, and Lange went to great lengths to spread news about his paper. He (helped by his family) sent about 75,000 letters to dog owners, institutions and dog associations throughout the country, informing them about the new paper. The first issue was published in June 1948. He maintained that politics were to be &quot;banished&quot; from the paper, except for issues directly related to the dog community; he thus criticised the tax on dog-keeping, and the ban on dogs in Oslo tenements.

Although Lange had promised to quit politics after the war, he sought to restart the Country Confederation for the Naval Defense of Norway by late 1947. He thought that the Labour Party government had returned to the pre-war negligence of the Norwegian defence, and that it was a &quot;tactic&quot; by the &quot;communists&quot; in order to allow the Soviet Union to grow itself stronger. His attempt to start the organisation again did however not materialise. Instead of this, one of the main issues for Lange until the early 1950s was to agitate for animal rights. This in turn led him back to his earlier issues of criticising bureaucracy, state capitalism and socialism. He arranged a public meeting at Youngstorget for the first time in 1950, and was thereafter sponsored by an anonymous group to hold one hundred political speeches throughout the country. One time he gathered a crowd of 19,000 people on Youngstorget, who started chanting &quot;Anders Lange, Norway needs you, Norway needs you.&quot; Lange himself was rather startled by the event, as he thought it recollected pre-war personality cults. He stopped touring in 1953 due to financial problems. He also stopped publishing the paper &quot;Hundeavisen&quot; in September 1953, as one of his associates had embezzled from the paper&#x27;s funding. Although Lange got most of the money back, the paper was not published for seven years.

Lange had great oratory talents, and he liked to consider himself a &quot;demagogue&quot; in the ancient Greek sense of the word. Lange planned a massive campaign with public speeches after the 1953 parliamentary election, but he was not able to raise the necessary funding. He largely stopped his political activities until 1959, when he again planned speeches at Youngstorget. Lange was often encouraged to start a political party during the 1950s, but he did not endorse the idea then. Although Lange kept contacts with all kinds of people, it was his contacts with businessmen and ship-owners that provided him with funds to keep up his political activities. During the 1960s, Lange was an immensely popular lecturer at secondary schools. He gained a considerable following among youth, and his followers were popularly called &quot;hundeguttene&quot;, the &quot;dog boys.&quot; They were often from the right-wing of the Young Conservatives, and they joined Lange for counter-demonstrations against meetings of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, May Day demonstrations, and protests against the Vietnam War.

In February 1960 the first issue of &quot;Hundeavisen&quot; was published after seven years. The paper, which originally was about dogs and animals, soon took a radical turn. The name of the paper was changed to &quot;Anders Langes Avis&quot; (Anders Lange&#x27;s Newspaper) in 1962, and it gradually became increasingly political. In its last years it had turned into a solely political paper. In 1961 Lange founded the &quot;Independence Party&quot;, but he did not register it publicly. Some of the issues for the &quot;party&quot; was to abolish direct taxes, sell state-owned companies, drastic cuts in public expenses, delegate tasks away from municipalities to the state, abandon the welfare system and cover it over the state budget, and revoke public employees&#x27; right to vote and run for parliament. The party held a counter-demonstration against a demonstration against the Bay of Pigs Invasion in Oslo in November 1962, and they handed out flyers in support of US President John F. Kennedy. The party changed name several times, to the &quot;Independence Movement&quot; in 1963, to the &quot;Freedom Party&quot; in 1965, and a few months later to &quot;Anders Lange&#x27;s Freedom Movement.&quot;

=== Anders Lange&#x27;s Party ===

By the end of 1972 Lange felt a growing support for his views, and he was again asked to start a new political party. He nonetheless questioned if he had become too old, and he initially rejected the idea. Towards 1973 he however increasingly felt a revival of the time from the Fatherland League, and he became sufficiently inspired to start seriously discuss creating a new party. On 8 April 1973, Lange held a public meeting at the cinema &quot;Saga kino&quot;, which eventually turned into the founding meeting of a new party. Norwegian politics was in turmoil at the time, with voters disaffected six months after the Norwegian EC membership referendum and generally disgruntled with the mainstream centre-right as a viable alternative to the Labour Party. Lange held a two-hour speech at &quot;Saga kino&quot;, which resulted in the establishment of Anders Lange&#x27;s Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention; usually shortened to Anders Lange&#x27;s Party (ALP). The issues promoted before the meeting concerned taxes, regulations, alcohol policies, private property, reduction in foreign aid as well as the political leadership.

Lange thereafter again started touring and speaking at public rallies; he did not use a manuscript for his speeches. On 5 May, a crowd of 5,000 people turned up at Youngstorget to listen to Lange and his Danish counterpart Mogens Glistrup. On his first appearance in a political television debate, Lange showed up with a bottle of egg liqueur and a Viking sword he had received from Geirr Tveitt, and his appearance in the debate became a success. Lange was not a big drinker, but he used egg liqueur during speeches to clear his throat. His use of the drink nonetheless led sales of Advocaat to soar. Lange finally entered the Norwegian Parliament after the 1973 parliamentary election, together with three other representatives from his party. Lange set a record of speeches during his first year in parliament, speaking more than any other representative. He was elected into the Consumer and Administration Committee, which he dismissed as a redundant entity. During his time in parliament he came on good terms with politicians from all parties. Lange said he only felt hostility from Kåre Willoch, leader of the Conservative Party, whose presence he considered to &quot;fill the room with hate;&quot; Willoch had expressed little respect for Lange before the 1973 election, labeling him as a &quot;mad-man&quot; and agitator without visions.

Lange had originally intended to create a popular movement rather than a political party, and an internal conflict erupted over the nature of the party. Lange favoured the superiority of the parliamentary group instead of the party organisation. The wing led by Carl I. Hagen and Kristoffer Almås wanted a more effective party structure, and even wished to throw Lange as leader and change the party&#x27;s name. After increasing pressure, during the party&#x27;s first regular national convention in Hjelmeland in January 1974, Lange and his deputy Erik Gjems-Onstad were forced to give concessions that gave ALP the outlines of a regular party. Lange however continued voicing his opposition against the new development, while Hagen and Almås maintained their views on the leadership and naming issues. After initially indicating that he would grant Hagen his wish of being hired as party secretary, Lange later stated in &quot;Dagbladet&quot; that Hagen only would be hired &quot;over my dead body.&quot; The conflict led Hagen and Almås to leave ALP in July, and Almås went on to form the Reform Party with Hagen as a passive member. The conflict was not resolved until October 1974, when Anders Lange died of heart failure following a heart attack. As Hagen had been elected as Lange&#x27;s parliamentary deputy in 1973 he took over Lange&#x27;s place as member of parliament.

Hagen later became leader of the party and reformed it as the Progress Party. As the party had grown to become the second largest in Norway, an oil painting portraying Lange was in 2005 put up and unveiled in the big conference room in the Norwegian parliament by Hagen and future leader Siv Jensen.
==Political views==
Lange supported the economic policies of Milton Friedman. When questioned during the 1973 parliamentary election about who his &quot;political philosopher&quot; was, Lange responded succinctly &quot;Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman&quot;. He also said that his motto was &quot;stand on your own feet, and not on others&#x27;.&quot; Lange voted in favour of the European Economic Community (mostly for military reasons), but he was satisfied that Norway did not join it following the 1972 referendum. This was as he expressed concern that the EEC would likely develop into a massive bureaucracy, and that France in his mind probably would misuse it due to the French &quot;need to dominate.&quot;

Guttorm Hansen, who was the President of the Parliament of Norway when Lange was a Member of Parliament, once said that he believed Lange&#x27;s apparent goal was to &quot;make [Parliament] into a political circus with himself as the main clown.&quot; Lange said many unexpected things in Parliament. He once bragged about his own potency, and another time spoke about how much moonshine he had consumed in his lifetime, and how terrible it was. He was also censored for the use of unparliamentary language.

Anders Lange wrote in 1963: &quot;Everyone who claims black majority rule in South Africa are traitors of the white race. No vote rights for negroes; Stop mixed marriages, No humanitarian aid for blacks.&quot;

==African relations==
Starting in 1962, Lange began promoting South Africa and Rhodesia in his paper. One of his main motivations was fears that the countries would turn communist, and he was critical of what he considered to be a one-sided and biased presentation of the conditions in the countries. He also had several Norwegian friends in South Africa who traded and did business in the country, and who also considered information about the country in Norway to be naïve and one-sided. Lange said that he received his information about the countries from numerous Norwegian, American and African magazines.

Lange was on several occasions visited by South Africans in Norway, both friends of Norwegian ancestry and people with central positions in the country, including General Charles Edward More. Lange and his wife Karin visited the country in early 1972 for three weeks, the trip having been arranged by long-time family friend Major John M. Gray. Their flight was welcomed by government representatives at an airport 50 kilometers outside Pretoria, and he met with prominent figures such as head of the Department of Information Eschel Rhoodie. He also met the leader of the Progressive Party, a party Lange praised for being the purest capitalist party in the world. He was also impressed with what he saw in the country, including the Bantu chiefs he met. Lange also advocated that Norway should recognize Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesia, an internationally unrecognized state. He wrote to Smith that &quot;Anders Langes Avis&quot; was the only paper in Norway that consistently supported his regime and sent issues of his paper to the Rhodesian Department of External Services. In response his paper received greetings and thanks from Smith and Rhodesian government officials.

In March 1979 as part of the Muldergate Scandal, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Lange and ALP had received 180,000 NOK from a secret South African fund. In December 1981, Gordon Winther claimed that ALP and Lange had received about 400,000 NOK since 1972. People who had been close to Lange however rejected that he had received money from the South African government. In a letter from 1967, Lange however notes that he would be delighted if he would get funds from South Africa (which he in any event had not received by that time), while another anonymous person who had been close to Lange claimed that he did indeed receive money, even to the point that it saved him from financial ruin.

==Personal life==
Lange married Anne-Marie Bach-Evensen (1906–1967) in 1930. They had exchanged letters when Lange was in Argentina, and became a couple soon after his return to Kristiansand, where she lived. They had three children. Anne-Marie got diabetes right before the German invasion, and she became very ill. This left Lange with more responsibilities of keeping in charge of their house and children. Although the family was poorly off itself during the war, they regularly invited homeless people into their house for oatmeal soup. Lange and his family moved to a farm in Tomter, Østfold, where they rented a house from October 1941 to 1946. During the war, Lange was hired as forest manager for the Løvenskiold family, and worked at their estate for two years.

Frederik Macody Lund, who had died in 1943, had long considered Lange to be his &quot;adoptive son&quot; as he had no children himself. As his first wife Augusta died in 1946, Lange inherited Svartskog in Oppegård, an 80 decare forest property. There, he established a kennel which he named &quot;Macody Lunds Minde-Vildmark&quot;, in honour of his late patron. In 1949 Lange however started seeing his neighbours&#x27; 21-year-old nanny. He filed for divorce from his wife Anne-Marie at the end of 1950, and the divorce was finalised on 18 February 1952. Lange thus moved from Svartskog, leaving it to Anne-Marie, and planned to marry his new girlfriend. They were engaged in 1951, but the relationship fast broke apart. Lange thereafter met Karin Thurmann-Moe (1927–1978), and they married on 17 June 1952, just two months after they first met. They had one child. In late 1952 Lange bought a 22 decare farm with a kennel, Trollstein in Heggedal, Asker. He received financial support to buy the property from a circle around the libertarian organisation Libertas. In addition to dogs, they had geese, hens, cows and pigs at Trollstein, and they grew potatoes and vegetables for their own use.

In January 1972, Lange unsuccessfully sought appointment as the broadcast manager of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.

Anders Lange died of heart failure at Bærum Hospital on 18 October 1974, following a heart attack at Asker Station on 10 October.

==Pre-history==
Santa Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people. The village of Comicranga was established in the Santa Monica area. One of the village&#x27;s notable residents was Victoria Reid, who was the daughter of the chief of the village. During the Spanish period, she was taken to Mission San Gabriel from her parents at the age of six. The general area of Santa Monica was referred to as Kecheek.

==1760s==
The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portolà, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Crespí on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs, that were reminiscent of the tears that Saint Monica shed over her son&#x27;s early impiety. The Kuruvungna Springs (&quot;the place where we are in the sun&quot;) are sacred to the Tongva People.

Regarding the latter, Crespi did note in his diary that the group found a Tongva village at the springs (where the SE corner of the campus of University High School is today). As is also recorded in his diary, Crespí named the place &quot;San Gregorio&quot;, while the expedition soldiers called it &quot;El Berendo&quot; after a deer they wounded there. The springs were probably commonly called by the name Santa Monica by the turn of the 19th century. By the 1820s, the name &quot;Santa Monica&quot; was in use and the name&#x27;s first official mention occurred in 1827 in the form of a grazing permit, quickly followed by the grant filing for the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica in 1828.

==1870s==
Government sovereignty in California passed from Mexico to the US on February 2, 1848. The northern sections of the city of Santa Monica once belonged to Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica and Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. The Sepulveda family sold of Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica for $54,000 in 1872 to Colonel Robert S. Baker and his wife, Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker. Bandini was the daughter of Juan Bandini, a prominent and wealthy early Californian, and was the widow of Abel Stearns, once the richest man in Los Angeles. Baker also bought a half interest in Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. Nevada Senator John P. Jones bought a half interest in Baker&#x27;s property in 1874.

Jones and Baker subdivided part of their joint holdings in 1875 and created the town of Santa Monica. The town site fronted on the ocean and was bounded on the northwest by Montana Avenue, on the southeast by Colorado Avenue and on the northeast by 26th Street. The avenues were all named after the states of the West, the streets being simply numbered. The first lots in Santa Monica were sold on July 15, 1875.

Jones built the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad, which connected Santa Monica and Los Angeles, and a wharf out into the bay. The first town hall was a modest 1873 brick building, later a beer hall, and now part of the Santa Monica Hostel. It is Santa Monica&#x27;s oldest extant structure.

The southwestern section of the city originally belonged to the Rancho La Ballona of the Machado and Talamantes families. Mrs. Nancy A. Lucas purchased from the rancho in 1874 for $11,000. The property was farmed by her sons, and a parcel of was sold to Williamson Dunn Vawter for subdivision in 1884.
==1880s==
The town&#x27;s new business district was initially centered around the current Third Street Promenade. Early street names consisted of both numbers and the names of western states; however Utah eventually became Broadway and Oregon became Santa Monica Boulevard.

By 1885, the town&#x27;s first hotel, the Santa Monica Hotel, was constructed on Ocean Ave., between Colorado and Utah in 1885. The Hotel burned in 1887. The 125-room &quot;Arcadia Hotel&quot; opened on January 25, 1887. Named for Arcadia Bandini, it was one of the great hotels on the Pacific Coast of its era. The hotel was the site where Colonel Griffith J. Griffith shot his wife in 1903, which led to their divorce and his (short) imprisonment.

The residents voted to incorporate November 30, 1886, and chose the first board of trustees. The original townsite was bounded by Montana Avenue on the north, 26th Street on the east, Colorado Avenue on the south, &amp; the Pacific Ocean on the west.

Senator Jones built a mansion, &quot;Miramar&quot;, and his wife Georgina planted a Moreton Bay Fig tree in its front yard in 1889. (The tree is now in the courtyard of the Fairmont Miramar Hotel and is the second-largest such tree in California, the largest being the tree in Santa Barbara.)

==1890s==
When the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived at Los Angeles, a dispute erupted over where to locate the seaport. The SP preferred Santa Monica, while others advocated for San Pedro Bay. The Long Wharf was built in 1893 at the north end of Santa Monica to accommodate large ships and was dubbed Port Los Angeles. At the time it was constructed, it was the longest pier in the world at 4700 feet, and accommodated a train. The plan did not last: San Pedro Bay, now known as the Port of Los Angeles, was selected by the United States Congress in 1897. Still, the Long Wharf acted as the major port of call for Los Angeles until 1903. Though the final decision disappointed Jones and other property owners, the selection allowed Santa Monica to maintain its scenic charm. The rail line down to Santa Monica Canyon was sold to the Pacific Electric Railway, and was in use from 1891 to 1933.

Meanwhile, Abbot Kinney acquired deed to the coastal strip previously purchased by W.D. Vawter and named the area &quot;Ocean Park&quot; in 1895. It became his first amusement park and residential project. A race track and golf course were built on the &quot;Ocean Park Casino&quot;. After a falling out with his partners he focused on the south end of the property, which he made into Venice of America.

==1900s==
Amusement piers became enormously popular in the first decades of the 20th century. The extensive Pacific Electric Railroad easily transported to the beaches people from across the Greater Los Angeles Area. Competing pier owners commissioned ever larger roller coaster rides. Wooden piers turned out to be readily flammable, but even destroyed piers were soon replaced. There were five piers in Santa Monica alone, with several more down the coast. The earliest part of the current Santa Monica Pier, which is now the last remaining amusement pier, was built in 1909 on what was referred to as the North Bay. The second half, an amusement park pier, was built later and the two rival piers were merged.

Among the South Bay piers, the most notable in this period was Abbot Kinney&#x27;s Venice of America pier, started in 1904 and built to rival his former partner&#x27;s Ocean Park Pier. Located at the end of Windward Avenue in Venice, Kinney&#x27;s pier was 900 feet long, 30 feet wide and included an Auditorium, large replica Ship Cafe, Dance Hall, Dentzel carousel, a Japanese Tea House and an Ocean Inn Restaurant. Venice soon became considered its own neighborhood.

A new charter was adopted in 1906 that converted the city government to a Mayor – Council form of government. Under the new charter, the City Council was composed of one Mayor with veto power, and one Councilmember from each of its seven wards.

Around the start of the 20th century, a growing population of Asian Americans lived in or near Santa Monica and Venice. A Japanese fishing village was located near the Long Wharf while small numbers of Chinese lived or worked in both Santa Monica and Venice. The two ethnic minorities were often viewed differently by White Americans who were often well-disposed towards the Japanese but condescending towards the Chinese. The Japanese village fishermen were an integral economic part of the Santa Monica Bay community.

==1910s==
Fraser&#x27;s Million Dollar Pier claimed to be the largest in the world at 1250 feet long and 300 feet wide. The pier housed a spacious dance hall, two carousels, an exhibit of premature babies in incubators at Frederick House, the Crooked House fun house, the Grand Electric Railroad, the Starland Vaudeville Theater, Breaker&#x27;s Restaurant, and a Panama Canal model exhibit. It burned 15 months after it opened.

A new charter was adopted in 1914 that converted the city government to a commission form. This proved to be very weak, especially since the police commissioner was poorly paid and had no accountability.

Auto racing became popular. Drivers would race an 8.4-mile loop made up of city streets. The &quot;Free-For-All Race&quot; was conducted between 1910 and 1912. The United States Grand Prix was held in Santa Monica in 1914 and 1916, awarding the &quot;American Grand Prize&quot; and the &quot;Vanderbilt Cup&quot; trophies. By 1919, the events were attracting 100,000 people, at which point the city halted them.

==1920s==
Donald Wills Douglas, Sr. founded the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1921 with his first plant on Wilshire Boulevard. He built a plant in 1922 at Clover Field (Santa Monica Airport), which was in use for 46 years. In 1924, four Douglas-built planes took off from Clover Field to attempt the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. Two planes made it back, after having covered 27,553 miles in 175 days, and were greeted on their return September 23, 1924, by a crowd of 200,000 (generously estimated). The Douglas Company (later McDonnell Douglas) kept facilities in the city until 1975. The entire facility was demolished and removed by 1977.
In 1922, a local newspaper, discussing African Americans, stated &quot;We don&#x27;t want you here; now and forever, this is to be a white man&#x27;s town&quot;.

The nationwide prosperity of the 1920s was felt in Santa Monica. The population increased from 15,000 to 32,000 at the end of the decade. Downtown saw a construction boom with many important buildings going up such as &quot;Henshey&#x27;s Department Store&quot; (destroyed) and the &quot;Criterion Theater&quot;. Elegant resorts were opened, including the 1925 &quot;Miramar Hotel&quot; and the 1926 &quot;Club Casa del Mar&quot;. The Los Angeles firm of Walker &amp; Eisen designed the art deco &quot;Bay City Building&quot;, a 13-story skyscraper topped with a huge four-faced clock that was finished in 1930.

Beach volleyball is believed to have been developed in Santa Monica during this time. Duke Kahanamoku brought a form of the game with him from Hawaii when he took a job as athletic director at the &quot;Beach Club&quot;. Competition began in 1924 with six-person teams, and by 1930 the first game with two-person teams took place.
&quot;La Monica Ballroom&quot; opened in 1924 on the Santa Monica Pier. It was capable of holding 10,000 dancers in its over 15,000 square foot (1,400 m2) area. A major storm in 1926 almost destroyed the pier and the ballroom, necessitating major repairs. &quot;La Monica&quot; hosted many national radio and television broadcasts in the early days of networks, before it was finally torn down in 1962. From 1958 to 1962 the ballroom became one of the largest roller-skating rinks in the western U.S.

Comedian Will Rogers bought a substantial ranch in &quot;Santa Monica Canyon&quot; in 1922. Among his improvements was a polo field where he played with friends Spencer Tracy, Walt Disney and Robert Montgomery. Upon his untimely death it was discovered that he had generously deeded to the public the ranch now known as Will Rogers State Historic Park, Will Rogers State Park, and Will Rogers State Beach. More recent residents of Santa Monica Canyon have included Christopher Isherwood, Don Bachardy, Jane Fonda, and Tom Hayden (the last two who previously lived in Ocean Park). The southern rim of the canyon is the oldest residential part of Santa Monica, while most of the canyon is in the City of Los Angeles.
In 1928, Will Rogers sold a parcel with two large houses on the beach at the base of the bluffs to William Randolph Hearst, who then gave it to Marion Davies. Architect Julia Morgan oversaw the construction of what ultimately became the $7 million, 5-building, 118-room &quot;Ocean House&quot;. As with other lavish Hearst/Morgan projects it contained entire rooms removed from antique European buildings. Davies was a vivacious and popular hostess and &quot;Ocean House&quot; saw many grand parties of Hollywood celebrities. Davies sold the property in 1945 for just $600,000 to a failed attempt at a hotel. Most of the property was torn down in 1958, leaving only the &quot;North House&quot; with a marble pool and tennis courts. The remaining property was sold to the State of California and leased as the private &quot;Sand and Sea Club&quot;. Following the expiration of the 30-year lease in 1990, management of the property was turned over to the City of Santa Monica. For a short period of time until the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the City operated the site as a public beach facility. It was also used as a shooting location, most notably in the TV show &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, in which it was the &quot;Beverly Hills Beach Club&quot;. Redevelopment of the property has been a political issue in the city since the 1990s. In 2006, the City Council approved plans for the first ever public beach club, which included the rehabilitation of the property and construction of new facilities. The project, now under construction, is made possible by a generous gift from the Annenberg Foundation, at the recommendation of Wallis Annenberg, and in partnership with the City of Santa Monica and California State Parks. The Annenberg Community Beach House at Santa Monica State Beach opened to the public on April 25, 2009. The total construction costs were roughly $30 million. Local residents succeeded in forcing the city to significantly limit its hours of operation.

The area around the Davies mansion became known as the &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. Stretching along Pacific Coast Highway between Santa Monica Canyon and the Santa Monica Pier it became fashionable in the 1930s for beach homes of discrete celebrities. Following the lead of Rogers and Davies, other actors with homes there have included Norma Talmadge, Greta Garbo and Cary Grant. Douglas Fairbanks spent his last years living there. Peter Lawford had a house there in the 1960s.

Ed Kolpin, Jr., opened a small tobacco, pipe, and cigar store in Santa Monica, the &quot;Tinder Box&quot;, in 1928. Later it moved to its current location in 1948 where it began serving the many Hollywood celebrities living nearby. Part of the attraction were the famous pipes handmade by Kolpin himself. In 1959 Kolpin began a tobacco-store franchise, at first locally and then by the mid-1960s there were &quot;Tinder Box&quot; stores in malls across America. The franchise business was sold in the 1970s, but Kolpin still owns and operates the original store as of 2003.

==1930s==

The Great Depression hit Santa Monica deeply. One report gives citywide employment in 1933 of just 1,000. Hotels and office building owners went bankrupt. The pleasure piers were a cheap form of entertainment that got cheaper, attracting a coarser crowd. Muscle Beach, located just south of the Santa Monica Pier, started to attract gymnasts and body builders who put on free shows for the public, and continues till today.

In the 1930s, corruption infected Santa Monica (along with neighboring Los Angeles). This aspect of the city is depicted in various Raymond Chandler novels, where Santa Monica is thinly disguised as &quot;Bay City&quot;. A sequence in Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; was inspired by the true story of the &quot;S.S. Rex.&quot; Beginning in 1928, gambling ships started anchoring in Santa Monica Bay just beyond the 3-mile (5.6 km) limit. Water taxis ferried patrons from Santa Monica and Venice. The largest such ship was the &quot;S.S. Rex&quot;, launched in 1938 and capable of holding up to 3,000 gamblers at a time. The &quot;Rex&quot; was a red flag to anti-gambling interests. After state Attorney General Earl Warren got a court order to shut the ships down as a nuisance, the crew of the &quot;Rex&quot; initially fought off police by using water cannons and brandishing sub-machine guns. The engine-less ship surrendered after nine days in what newspapers called &quot;The Battle of Santa Monica Bay&quot;. Its owner, Anthony Cornero, went on to build the Stardust casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The greatest benefit to the city came from the Douglas Corporation when it built the DC-3 commercial aircraft. The DC-3, which first flew from Clover Field, was a terrifically successful airliner that transformed the air transportation business and brought needed jobs to the city. In a more modest show of entrepreneurship, Merle Norman founded Merle Norman Cosmetics in 1931 by making creams and cosmetics on her kitchen stove. Both her former house and her 1933 Streamline-styled business headquarters are well maintained.

The federal Works Project Administration helped build several buildings in the city, most notably &quot;City Hall&quot;. The 1938 Art Deco structure was designed by Donald Parkinson and features terrazzo mosaics by Stanton Macdonald-Wright. The main &quot;Post Office&quot; and &quot;Barnum Hall&quot; (Santa Monica High School auditorium) were among several other WPA projects.

==1940s==

Douglas&#x27;s business grew astronomically with the onset of World War II, employing as many as 44,000 people in 1943. To defend against air attack set designers from the Warner Brothers Studios prepared elaborate camouflage that disguised the factory and airfield.

In 1945, Santa Monica City College started the Community Radio Workshop (CRW) to teach returning GIs broadcasting and used the call letters &quot;KCRW&quot;. (Later KCRW became a popular and innovative NPR affiliate.)

The Sears building was built in 1947 at the south end of the retail district and has retained architect Rowland Crawford&#x27;s original late-Moderne styling.

The RAND Corporation began as a project of the Douglas Company in 1945, and spun off into an independent think tank on May 14, 1948. RAND eventually acquired a 15-acre (61,000 m2) campus centrally located between the Civic Center and the pier entrance.

As a response to the corruption and inefficiency that grew in the 1930s, the current charter was enacted in 1946. The city government adopted a council-manager government.

==1950s==

Papermate opened its Santa Monica factory in 1957. The plant produced 600 million ballpoint pens in 1971 and closed in 2005.

The 3,000-seat Santa Monica Civic Auditorium was built on the site of Santa Monica&#x27;s red-lined African American neighborhood, known as Belmar. Construction began soon after the removal of Belmar&#x27;s residents. The auditorium was designed in the International Style by Welton Becket, opened in 1958. From 1961 to 1968 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences held its annual &quot;Oscar&quot; awards ceremony there. Performers that have appeared over the decades include: Joan Baez, The Beach Boys, Tony Bennett, David Bowie, Dave Brubeck, Buzzcocks, The Carpenters, Ray Charles, The Clash, Bill Cosby, Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald, Allen Ginsberg, Arlo Guthrie, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Hope, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, André Previn, Public Enemy, Ramones, The Rolling Stones, Pete Seeger, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, T.Rex, Jonathan Winters, and countless others. Since the late 1980s the auditorium has been more popular for trade conventions than performances. The films &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot; and &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot; were shot there.

Pacific Ocean Park, the last of the great amusement piers, opened in 1958. While it temporarily eclipsed competitor Disneyland, attendance later plummeted and by 1967 the park was foreclosed for back taxes. It sat empty and rotting, an unattractive &quot;attractive nuisance&quot; until finally removed in 1974.

Adjacent to Pacific Ocean Park was the rock and roll club, The Cheetah, which featured early
performances by such acts as The Doors, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, Love, The Mothers of Invention, The Seeds, Buffalo Springfield and others. It closed in 1968.

The Synanon drug rehabilitation cult moved into the old National Guard building in 1959 and added their strange presence to the area. In 1967 it moved into the swank Del Mar Club until 1978. After that they held a small presence until shut down in 1991.

==1960s==

The completion of the Santa Monica Freeway in 1966 brought the promise of new prosperity for some, although it was at the cost of decimating Santa Monica&#x27;s red-lined African American enclave and Hispanic &quot;La Viente&quot; barrio running between Olympic and Pico.

Third Street in downtown was converted into the &quot;Santa Monica Mall&quot; in 1965, an innovative but ultimately unsuccessful development that turned the three block core of the retail district into an open-air pedestrian mall. Large parking structures were built, but rarely filled. Within a couple of decades it was in severe decline. (The &quot;Santa Monica Mall&quot;, just prior to its conversion to the &quot;Third Street Promenade&quot;, is a location for some scenes in the movie, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;).

The Douglas plant closed in 1968, depriving Santa Monica of its largest employer. A decade passed before the site was redeveloped into an office park. The Museum of Flying was opened on the same site another decades later, in 1989.

Bandleader Lawrence Welk built the &quot;Champagne Towers&quot; apartment building and the adjoining &quot;Lawrence Welk Plaza&quot; in 1969. The plaza is now known by its address, &quot;100 Wilshire&quot;, and it is still the tallest building in the city.

==1970s==
During the 1970s, a remarkable number of notable fitness- and health-related businesses started in the city. The Supergo bicycle shop (originally named Bikecology founded by Susan and Alan Goldsmith as a pro ten-speed bike shop opened in 1971, and was ranked the top grossing bike shop in America by the time it relocated from Wilshire Blvd to the corner of 5th and Broadway in 1995. And coincidentally work on the bicycle path along the beach was undertaken by the city. The &quot;Santa Monica Track Club&quot;, founded in 1972 by Joe Douglas, has helped the careers of many Olympians, such as Carl Lewis. Sensei James Field opened his dojo in 1974, which became one of the primary Shotokan karate schools in the US and is now called the &quot;Japan Karate Association (JKA) Santa Monica&quot;. Joe Gold, who had sold his chain of Gold&#x27;s Gyms years before, started the World Gym chain in 1977. Nathan Pritikin opened the &quot;Pritikin Longevity Center&quot; in the Casa Del Mar building in 1978 after prior owner Synanon tried to murder attorney Paul Morantz by placing rattlesnake in his mailbox. Ocean Park resident Jane Fonda opened a small aerobics studio on Main Street.

In the late 1970s, progressivism became the dominant political force in Santa Monica. Santa Monicans for Renters&#x27; Rights (SMRR) formed in 1978 and was led by Ruth Yannatta Goldway, Derek Shearer, Dennis Zane, and Reverend James Conn with support from Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda. Conn&#x27;s Ocean Park Community Organization (OPCO) was formed in 1979 as an adjunct to the Church in Ocean Park, partly in reaction to the rapid pace of change along Main Street. It was the first of what became nine community organizations that serve as neighborhood advocates. A strict rent control ordinance passed in 1979 and SMRR achieved a council majority in 1981. It has largely remained the controlling political organization since then.

By 1977, the large 1894 &quot;American Foursquare&quot;-style home of Roy Jones (son of founder John P. Jones) was threatened with destruction. It had been converted into rooming houses and was decrepit. It, along with an adjoining 19th century house, was saved by being relocated to Main Street in Ocean Park and renovated. The Jones house became the home of the Santa Monica Heritage Museum and the other house became a restaurant. The salvation of the buildings was representative of the changes taking place in the city.

The late-1970s/early-1980s situation comedy &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; was set in Santa Monica.

==1980s==

After the economic doldrums of the 1960s and early 1970s, the city&#x27;s economy began to recover in the 1980s. An early sign of that change was in the neighborhood of Ocean Park. Main Street, a quaint mile of sawdust bars and dilapidated stores selling old furniture, was upgraded by the concerted efforts of a new generation of owners. Soon it was attracting increasingly expensive boutiques and restaurants. At the northern end of Main Street adjacent to the still-declining Santa Monica Mall, a city block was levelled in 1980 to build a new mall, Santa Monica Place, designed by architect Frank Gehry. Further south on Main Street, the mixed-use museum, retail, and restaurant complex, Edgemar – also designed by Frank Gehry – opened in 1988.

While the Santa Monica Pier had been preserved from intentional destruction in 1973, it was nonetheless poorly maintained. By the 1980s it had become a blight. The area around the pier was filled with poorly built and maintained buildings that housed seedy biker bars and head shops. The pier itself had dilapidated bars, an odd plaster statue store, and creepy game arcades. The city put off repairing the breakwater that protected the pier and the so-called &quot;yacht harbor&quot; immediately north. Studies were made for rehabilitation of the pier and repair of the breakwater, but they were never acted upon. In 1983 major winter storms, part of the El Niño weather pattern, struck Santa Monica on January 27 and again on March 1. The storms destroyed more than a third of the pier, along with stores, bars, cars, and a large crane brought in to begin repairs. Rebuilding the pier was a contentious effort, costing $43 million. Ultimately the work was completed and the pier remains the city&#x27;s best-known landmark. Three interesting buildings owned by the city were abandoned and destroyed, including the &quot;Sinbad&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; that featured a large whale&#x27;s tail in the facade.

In the 1980s, the city put together the plan for turning the failed &quot;Santa Monica Mall&quot; into the &quot;Santa Monica Promenade&quot;. The project, completed in 1989 has proven to be a huge success and is a major regional shopping and entertainment center. Between 1988 and 1998, taxable sales in the city grew 440%, quadrupling city revenues. Retails rents in the development area also quadrupled. More than $500 million of private money has been invested into the Promenade and the adjacent streets in the Bayside District Corporation business association.

The city opened its &quot;Public Electronic Network (PEN)&quot; in 1989, providing citizens with a bulletin board system (BBS) to discuss local issues and access city services. PEN was the first municipally operated BBS in the world. While plagued by the ills common to BBSes, the site empowered residents. Due in part to the placement of publicly available terminals in libraries, homeless persons and their issues received considerable attention on PEN. The SWASHLOCK (Showers, WASHers, and LOCKers) plan was developed on PEN and implemented in 1993. PEN also served as a center to organize opposition to the 1990 proposal to redevelop &quot;415 PCH&quot;.

==1990s==
The 1990s saw continued development in Santa Monica. The Promenade caught on. &quot;Colorado Place&quot;, &quot;Water Garden&quot;, and other nearby office developments on the east side of town attracted MGM, Sony, Symantec, and other corporations. The &quot;Shutters Hotel&quot; was the first of several new hotels built between the pier and Pico Boulevard. One of them, the &quot;Loews&quot;, is on the site of the long forgotten Arcadia Hotel. The Casa Del Mar returned to its former glory as a luxury hotel in 1999 after a reported $60 million renovation by the owners of the Shutters Hotel. Even the comparatively dowdy Miramar Hotel found new prominence with the many visits of President Bill Clinton.

In 1994, an old rail station was transformed by the city into Bergamot Station, a collection of art galleries that has become a center of art exhibition and retailing.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake caused the loss of many residences and historic buildings, particularly on the north side of the city. Other notable damage: St. John&#x27;s hospital came close to collapsing; Honda of Santa Monica&#x27;s parking structure pancaked crushing numerous cars. In all, 100 buildings were condemned outright, including 3,100 apartment units, while far more suffered repairable damage.

The &quot;Evening Outlook&quot;, which had been purchased by the Copley Press newspaper chain in 1983, was closed in 1998 after 123 years of reporting. It reportedly had 20,000 paid subscription at the time of the closure.

MTBE, a major gasoline additive (10% by volume), was discovered in the city&#x27;s water wells in August 1995. The MTBE was found almost by accident since it was not on the list of known contaminants and acceptable level had not been set. The city waters engineers had to research the hazard and they raised the alarm. Within a year all five wells were closed, leading to the loss of 45% of the city&#x27;s water supply. One well had a concentration of 600 parts per billion, while another rose from 14 parts per billion to 490 parts per billion within a year. The California EPA guidelines now call for no more than 35 parts per billion. The city&#x27;s well field is in the &quot;Charnock Sub-Basin&quot;, a small aquifer in Mar Vista, Los Angeles that both Santa Monica and Culver City draw upon. To maintain supply to customers Santa Monica was forced to purchase water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) at a cost of over $1.1 million per year. Cleanup of the site is ongoing at a current cost of $3 million per year, paid for by the responsible parties, principally: Shell, Chevron and Exxon. Following this discovery other water districts began testing that revealed tens of thousands of MTBE pollution cases across the United States.

Santa Monica also was booming in business at the time. The state of California enacted a law, effective January 1, 1999, that overrode Santa Monica&#x27;s rent control ordinance by mandating vacancy decontrol. Landlords were reported to have raised rents so high that units remained vacant, requiring them to lower their rents to more marketable levels. Rent controls remained on inhabited units, leading to stories of landlords harassing existing tenants in order to make them leave so that higher rents could be charged.

==2000s==
On July 16, 2003, George Russell Weller drove his Buick at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour through the busy downtown Farmers Market, which was held on a city street that was closed to vehicular traffic by temporary signage at each end. The 86-year-old driver killed 10 that day and injured 63, stopping only due to the Buick&#x27;s engine and transmission being clogged with body parts. The city vigorously fought against accepting its responsibility in causing the death and injuries of market patrons through the lack of any barricade. In the wake of numerous civil lawsuits filed against the City of Santa Monica and the company organizing the Farmer&#x27;s Market, a new policy was adopted requiring portable concrete barricades to reliably block vehicle access for pedestrian street events.

Santa Monica passed a law in 2003 restricting the distribution of food to homeless people in the city. Some organizations have deliberately disobeyed these laws.

The increasingly upscale nature of the city – not just the northern part, which was always affluent, but the southern Ocean Park neighborhood as well which has become a favorite of those in the entertainment industry – has created some tensions between newcomers and longtime residents nostalgic for the more bohemian, countercultural past. Nevertheless, with the recent corporate additions of Yahoo! (2005) and Google (2006), gentrification continued.

During the 2000s, LA Metro developed plans to return rail transit to Santa Monica, which was gone after the dismantling of the Pacific Electric Railway during the 1960s. It developed two plans, including the Metro Expo Line and Metro Purple Line, both of which would extend into Santa Monica. The Purple Line was originally to be extended into Santa Monica, but was stopped due to legislative action. However, Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, one of those who opposed the Purple Line&#x27;s extension, eventually reconsidered extending the Purple Line into Santa Monica. The proposal to extend the Purple Line was described colloquially as the Subway to the Sea.

==2010s==
On June 7, 2013, a killing spree occurred in several locations at or near the campus of Santa Monica College. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old John Zawahri, fired shots from an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle, killing six people, including himself. The shootings started at Zawahri&#x27;s father&#x27;s house, where he fatally shot his father and brother after a domestic dispute, and afterwards, he set the home on fire. He then commandeered a passing vehicle and fired several shots at other vehicles, including a city bus and a police cruiser, killing two and wounding several others. Upon arriving at Santa Monica College, Zawahri shot and killed a woman outside and then fired 70 shots inside the college library, hitting no one. He was then shot by responding police officers after engaging them in a gunfight, later dying after being taken outside.

In 2016, construction of the LA Metro E line was completed and it began servicing Santa Monica.

== 2020s ==
Santa Monica experienced looting during the 2020 George Floyd protests. By 2024, homelessness increasingly affected local businesses via reduced sales and increased crime. Starting in the mid-2010s and continuing to the mid-2020s, the Third Street Promenade experienced vacancies due to high rents, the retail apocalypse, the COVID-19 pandemic, the homelessness crisis, rising inflation, and difficulty sub-dividing its large buildings. Third Street Promenade has also lost foot traffic and street performers.

<text>A gas laser is a laser in which an electric current is discharged through a gas to produce coherent light. The gas laser was the first continuous-light laser and the first laser to operate on the principle of converting electrical energy to a laser light output. The first gas laser, the Helium–neon laser (HeNe), was co-invented by Iranian engineer and scientist Ali Javan and American physicist William R. Bennett, Jr., in 1960. It produced a coherent light beam in the infrared region of the spectrum at 1.15 micrometres.

== Types of gas laser ==

Gas lasers using many gases have been built and used for many purposes.

Carbon dioxide lasers, or  lasers can emit hundreds of kilowatts at 9.6 μm and 10.6 μm, and are often used in industry for cutting and welding. The efficiency of a laser is over 10%.

Carbon monoxide or &quot;CO&quot; lasers have the potential for very large outputs, but the use of this type of laser is limited by the toxicity of carbon monoxide gas. Human operators must be protected from this deadly gas. Furthermore, it is extremely corrosive to many materials including seals, gaskets, etc.

Helium–neon (HeNe) lasers can be made to oscillate at over 160 different wavelengths by adjusting the cavity Q to peak at the desired wavelength. This can be done by adjusting the spectral response of the mirrors or by using a dispersive element (Littrow prism) in the cavity. Units operating at 633 nm are very common in schools and laboratories because of their low cost and near-perfect beam qualities.

Nitrogen lasers operate in the ultraviolet range, typically 337.1 nm, using molecular nitrogen as its gain medium, pumped by an electrical discharge.

TEA lasers are energized by a high voltage electrical discharge in a gas mixture generally at or above atmospheric pressure. The acronym &quot;TEA&quot; stands for Transversely Excited Atmospheric.

===Chemical lasers===

Chemical lasers are powered by a chemical reaction and can achieve high powers in continuous operation. For example, in the hydrogen fluoride laser (2.7–2.9 μm) and the deuterium fluoride laser (3.8 μm) the reaction is the combination of hydrogen or deuterium gas with combustion products of ethylene in nitrogen trifluoride. They were invented by George C. Pimentel.

Chemical lasers are powered by a chemical reaction permitting a large amount of energy to be released quickly. Such very high power lasers are especially of interest to the military. Further, continuous-wave chemical lasers at very high power levels, fed by streams of gasses, have been developed and have some industrial applications.

===Excimer lasers===

Excimer lasers are powered by a chemical reaction involving an &quot;excited dimer&quot;, or &quot;excimer&quot;, which is a short-lived dimeric or heterodimeric molecule formed from two species (atoms), at least one of which is in an excited electronic state. They typically produce ultraviolet light, and are used in semiconductor photolithography and in LASIK eye surgery. Commonly used excimer molecules include F2 (fluorine, emitting at 157 nm), and noble gas compounds (ArF [193 nm], KrCl [222 nm], KrF [248 nm], XeCl [308 nm], and XeF [351 nm]).

===Ion lasers===

Argon-ion lasers emit light in the range 351–528.7 nm. Depending on the optics and the laser tube a different number of lines is usable but the most commonly used lines are 458 nm, 488 nm and 514.5 nm.

===Metal-vapor lasers===
Metal-vapor lasers are gas lasers that typically generate ultraviolet wavelengths. Helium-silver (HeAg) 224 nm, neon-copper (NeCu) 248 nm and helium-cadmium (HeCd) 325 nm are three examples. These lasers have particularly narrow oscillation linewidths of less than 3 GHz (500 femtometers),
making them candidates for use in fluorescence suppressed Raman spectroscopy.

The Copper vapor laser, with two spectral lines of green (510.6 nm) and yellow (578.2 nm), is the most powerful laser with the highest efficiency in the visible spectrum.

== Advantages ==
* High volume of active material
* Active material is relatively inexpensive
* Almost impossible to damage the active material
* Heat can be removed quickly from the cavity

== Applications ==
* He-Ne laser is mainly used in making holograms.
* In laser printing He-Ne laser is used as a source for writing on the photosensitive material.
* He-Ne lasers were used in reading Bar Codes, which are imprinted on products in stores. They have been largely replaced by laser diodes.
* Nitrogen lasers and excimer laser are used in pulsed dye laser pumping.
* Ion lasers, mostly argon, are used in CW dye laser pumping.

<doc id="1193376" wikidata="Q7332012" url="?curid=1193376" title="Rickwood Field">
<text>Rickwood Field, located in Birmingham, Alabama, is the oldest existing professional baseball park in the United States. It was built for the Birmingham Barons in 1910 by industrialist and team-owner Rick Woodward and has served as the home park for the Birmingham Barons and the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro leagues.

Though the Barons moved their home games to Hoover Metropolitan Stadium after the 1988 season, Rickwood Field has been preserved and is undergoing gradual restoration as a &quot;working museum&quot; where baseball&#x27;s history can be experienced. The Barons also play one regular season game a year at Rickwood Field. 

Rickwood Field is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Birmingham chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research is named after the historic ballpark.

==Construction and opening==
The Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team began playing professionally in 1887, with their home games at an informal park called &quot;Slag Pile Field&quot; in West End. In 1901 they joined the Southern Association.

Allen Harvey &quot;Rick&quot; Woodward, chairman of Woodward Iron Company and grandson of pioneer Birmingham industrialist Stimpson Harvey Woodward, purchased a majority share of the Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team from J. William McQueen in 1909 while he was still in his 20s. Immediately he began planning a grand showplace for his new team. He contacted Connie Mack for advice on the details, including the field dimensions. He settled on Shibe Park in Philadelphia (which was controlled by Mack&#x27;s team and later renamed Connie Mack Stadium) and Forbes Field in Pittsburgh as the models for the new park. He purchased land in the West End neighborhood of Birmingham from the Alabama Central Railroad. 

The $75,000 structure was designed by Southeastern Engineering Company of Birmingham (a short-lived subsidiary of Pittsburgh&#x27;s General Fireproofing Company) and completed during the summer of 1910. The 12.7 acre (51,000 m2) park was flanked along the basepaths by concrete and steel stands. A tile-roofed cupola on the roof behind home plate provided space for the announcer and the press. Woodward named the field after himself, using his nickname and the first part of his last name. It was the first concrete-and-steel stadium in Minor League Baseball.

Woodward invited Alabama Governor Braxton Bragg Comer, Birmingham Mayor Culpepper Exum, civic leader, George B. Ward and Victor H. Hanson, publisher of &quot;The Birmingham News&quot;, for opening day on August 18, 1910. The day was celebrated by businesses closing all over town to allow fans to fill the park for the first pitch at 3:30 P.M. Over 10,000 people attended that first game in which the Barons defeated the visiting Montgomery Climbers, 3–2. 

The new ballpark attracted the Philadelphia Phillies to Birmingham for spring training in 1911. The &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported, &quot;The players were agreeably surprised to find Rickwood field, for such it is named, one of the most complete and commodious minor league parks in the country. It lacks nothing either for the convenience of the player or the comfort of the spectator.&quot; After a week of intrasquad games, the Phillies opened against the Barons on Saturday, March 11, 1911. 

In 1912, a spring tornado tore through the field, pulling up the outfield fence. Two years later, Woodward felt the need to have electric fans installed in the grandstands for the comfort of the crowd. The Pittsburgh Pirates also made Rickwood Field their spring training home in 1919.

==1910s–1940s==

The Alabama Crimson Tide played many home games at Rickwood Field between 1912 and 1927. The Tide had played home games on The Quad from 1893 to 1914, and built University Field in 1915. Rickwood&#x27;s larger capacity enabled the Tide to sell more tickets and play before bigger crowds until Denny Stadium opened in 1929.

In 1921, the outfield fence was damaged in a tornado and quickly rebuilt. During 1924 to 1927, the infield bleachers were covered with a steel-framed roof designed by Denham, VanKeuren &amp; Denham, Architects of Birmingham. Shortly after, in 1928, a new Mission style entry structure with offices was built to the designs of Paul Wright &amp; Co., Engineers of Birmingham. A new concrete outfield wall replaced the original fence.

In 1931, in the first game of the Dixie Series championship, Birmingham&#x27;s 43-year-old Ray Caldwell outpitched 22-year-old Dizzy Dean, who had guaranteed a win. The Barons won the series, 4 games to 3. In 1936, four monumental steel-frame light towers designed and fabricated by the Truscon Steel Company of Youngstown, Ohio, were erected, allowing for night games. 

In 1938, Woodward sold the park to Ed Norton, a local businessman. In 1940, Norton sold it to the Cincinnati Reds. At that time, new outfield fences were built inside the original walls to reduce the field dimensions. G. J. Jebeles of Birmingham purchased the park in 1944. A ladies&#x27; rest room was added and the outfield fence reduced again in 1948. In 1949, ownership changed hands again, going to a partnership of Al DeMent, Al Belcher, and Rufus Lackey. They added a small restaurant in the entrance building in 1950 and installed additional box seats, necessitating the relocations of the dugouts farther down the baselines. In 1958, Belcher gained a majority share and control of the park.

==1950s–1987==

In 1964, General Manager Glynn West purchased 1000 wooden seats from New York City&#x27;s Polo Grounds and installed them at the park. 

Major-league teams played preseason exhibition games at Rickwood as recently as the 1970s. The Phillies and Pirates played in front of 4,311 fans on April 10, 1965, and 6,109 fans the following day, April 11, 1965 who saw Roberto Clemente play right field for the Pirates, and get three hits in a 5-1 victory. 

Belcher sold Rickwood Field in 1966 to the City of Birmingham, but retained a lease for the remainder of that year.

In 1966, the lease was transferred to Charlie Finley, who brought the Kansas City Athletics Double-A farm team to Birmingham for the 1967 season. Many of the players on that team later became the backbone of the championship major-league A&#x27;s, including Reggie Jackson, Dave Duncan, and many of their pitchers. Among other things, that year is remembered for the day that 14,000 disappointed fans were sent home early when the Atlanta Braves vs. Southern League All-Stars exhibition game was called &quot;on account of tornado.&quot; During this period, following a trend which swept minor league baseball (and which has since been largely reversed), the team took the name of the parent major-league club and was known as the &quot;Birmingham A&#x27;s&quot;.

The Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles played a preseason exhibition game at Rickwood on April 2, 1974. On the verge of breaking Babe Ruth&#x27;s all time homerun record, the Braves&#x27; Hank Aaron was honored on the field prior to the game, receiving proclamations from Birmingham mayor George Seibels and governor George Wallace.

Between 1979 and 1980, the wooden seats were replaced with plastic seats in the box areas and metal bleachers under the grandstands.

In 1981, Art Clarkson brought minor league baseball back to Rickwood with the Detroit Tigers Double-A club, which resumed the Barons name. He had a new electronic scoreboard installed at the park. In 1986, the Barons became the Chicago White Sox Double-A club, an affiliation that continues today.

In 1987, the Barons moved to a new facility, Hoover Metropolitan Stadium, in the suburb of Hoover. They returned to Birmingham in 2013 with the opening of Regions Field, just south of downtown Birmingham.

==1990s–2023==
Since 1992, the ballpark has been under the care of the Friends of Rickwood who are restoring the facility to its former glory. They also host frequent amateur, police and semi-pro games and open the gates to visitors who can walk in and explore the grandstands or run the bases.

Since 1996, Rickwood Field has hosted the Barons for a throwback game in which both teams wear period uniforms. Each game honors a different era in Birmingham baseball history. Ballpark enthusiasts from across North America migrate to Rickwood to attend this Double-A regulation game, named the &quot;Rickwood Classic&quot;, every season. 

The ballpark was used by several film productions which contributed to the recreation of the scoreboard and press box and the addition of 1940s period-style advertisements on the outfield fence. Some of these retro-style ads have been sponsored by real Birmingham businesses, including a section sponsored by the descendants of Rick Woodward that advertises long-gone Woodward Iron Co. The outfield signs were designed by Ted Haigh, a Los Angeles–based graphic designer and executed by Skidmore Sign Company of Birmingham.

As of 2005, the Friends of Rickwood have spent around $2 million refurbishing the grandstands, press-box, locker rooms, roof and main entrance to the park. Future plans include establishing a Museum of Southern Baseball.

Since 2011, Play at the Plate Baseball has held an annual three-day adult baseball tournament with four teams from various regions of the country participating. The event is usually held in June.

ESPN Classic broadcast a re-enactment of a Negro league baseball game played at Rickwood on February 26, 2006. It featured teams wearing the uniforms of the fictitious &quot;Bristol Barnstormers&quot; (named for ESPN&#x27;s hometown of Bristol, Connecticut) and the Birmingham Black Barons.

In 2022 and 2023, Rickwood Field hosted Savannah Bananas &quot;bananaball&quot; games. 

==2023 renovations and 2024 MLB game==

On June 20, 2023, Major League Baseball announced that a regular season game between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants would be played at Rickwood Field on June 20, 2024, as part of a salute to the Negro leagues in observance of Juneteenth. The facility was scheduled to undergo further renovations in preparation for the game. Beginning October 2023, these renovations included &quot;upgrading the grass playing surface to modern big league standards, padding and moving the outfield walls, overhauling the dugouts, adding new lights&quot; as well as other items.

The ballpark underwent $5 million in renovations by 2024 which included a new playing surface, a new padded wall (which will be removed from the wall after the game) that is deeper than the original, and shifting the entire field to the left by to make the field more symmetrical. Other renovations include new dugouts, a modern batter&#x27;s eye in center field, a digital scoreboard, netting along the foul lines, and accessibility upgrades.

In addition to the June 20, 2024, game between the Giants and Cardinals, Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Montgomery Biscuits (Rays affiliate) and Birmingham Barons (White Sox affiliate) of Double-A played a game at Rickwood Field on June 18, 2024. The visiting Biscuits wore Montgomery Gray Sox road uniforms while the home Barons wore Birmingham Black Barons home uniforms. Amid the game, the public address announcer notified the crowd of the passing of Willie Mays, who grew up near Rickwood Field and started his pro baseball career with the Black Barons in 1948.

==Local use==

Miles College&#x27;s Division II Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference baseball team will play home games at Rickwood beginning with the 2025 season.

Birmingham City high schools play home games there as well.

==Popular culture==

The ballpark was used for scenes in the film biopics of Jackie Robinson (&quot;42&quot;) and Ty Cobb (&quot;Cobb&quot;). The 1995 movie &quot;Soul of the Game&quot; features the park. The field is mentioned in the Willie Mays documentary, &quot;Say Hey, Willie Mays!&quot;, while detailing Mays&#x27; earlier professional career with the Birmingham Black Barons.

<text>The Katholieke Universiteit Brussel (, &quot;Catholic University of Brussels&quot;) was a Flemish university located in Brussels, founded in 1969 as &quot;University Faculties St Aloysius&quot; (UFSAL), in many ways the equivalent of a liberal arts college. It split up from the primarily French-speaking Saint-Louis University, Brussels to become an independent Dutch-speaking institution. It became recognised as a university by the Flemish Community of Belgium in the early 1990s. It only ever awarded basic undergraduate degrees, which in the older Belgian system of a four-year licenciate meant students had to go on to other universities to complete their courses of study.

In the late 1990s, as a result of politically fuelled doubts about the university&#x27;s survival, student levels fell drastically, with a knock-on effect on government funding. In 2007 the university merged with a number of other tertiary institutions in Brussels (see Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel (HUB, European University College Brussels)), and then had a separate existence only as a legal fiction for accreditation and funding purposes.

In 2013, the academic degrees of the KUB were integrated in the Catholic University of Leuven.

<doc id="1193381" wikidata="Q265450" url="?curid=1193381" title="Brian Kilrea">
<text>Brian Blair &quot;Killer&quot; Kilrea (born October 21, 1934) is a Canadian former ice hockey head coach, general manager, and player. He played 26 games in the National Hockey League with the Detroit Red Wings and Los Angeles Kings between 1958 and 1967, with the rest of his playing career, which lasted from 1955 to 1970, spent in American Hockey League. Kilrea then became a coach and coached and managed the Ottawa 67&#x27;s of the Ontario Hockey League for 32 seasons between 1974 and 2015, after which he continued as general manager. He is a Hockey Hall of Fame member in the Builders category.

==Playing career==
Kilrea played his first major junior season with the Hamilton Tiger Cubs in 1954–55. In his playing career, he played only 26 NHL games, although he had great success in the minor leagues. Kilrea spent four seasons with the Troy Bruins of the IHL, where he was named a second-team All-Star in 1958–1959. Most of Kilrea&#x27;s career was spent with the AHL&#x27;s Springfield Indians, where he was a multiple All-Star and the franchise&#x27;s career leader in assists. He has been named to the Springfield Hockey Hall of Fame. Kilrea played under Eddie Shore and credits Shore with teaching him many things that he took into his coaching career.

Kilrea returned to the NHL briefly, with expansion in 1967. Kilrea has the distinction of scoring the first-ever goal for the NHL Los Angeles Kings. It was during his time with the team&#x27;s AHL franchise that the roots for what would become the National Hockey League Players Association would arise, as a direct result of the efforts of Kilrea and Alan Eagleson, then the agent for Bobby Orr.

==Coaching career==
After ending his playing career, Kilrea started coaching minor hockey in Ottawa. He first made a name for himself when his Ottawa West Midget AA team defeated a touring Soviet squad, the only loss by the Soviets on their tour. This caught the attention of the owners of the OHL major junior Ottawa 67&#x27;s and they soon offered him a coaching job, replacing Leo Boivin at the start of the 1974–75 season. He would continue coaching the 67&#x27;s until 1984, when he became an assistant coach with the defending Stanley Cup champions, New York Islanders of the NHL. However, after two seasons, he would return to coaching the 67&#x27;s. Head coach of the Sarnia Sting, Dave McQueen played for Kilrea and said that Kilrea had his players over to his house at Christmas but when you were in his &#x27;dog house&#x27; it was often tough to get out.

Except for a brief retirement for the 1994–95 season, Kilrea coached the 67&#x27;s until the end of the 2008–09 season, and was also the General Manager of the club. He won the Memorial Cup, emblematic of Canada&#x27;s major junior championship, twice with the 67&#x27;s (1984 and 1999) and is the winningest coach in junior hockey history – a task completed on January 17, 1997, with his 742nd win. On February 2, 2007, Brian Kilrea coached his 2000th game as head coach of the 67&#x27;s.

Kilrea also won the Matt Leyden Trophy as OHL Coach of the Year in 1980–81, 1981–82, 1995–96, 1996–97 and 2002–03. Kilrea was also honored with the Bill Long Award in 1994, for distinguished service to the OHL.

In 2003, Brian Kilrea was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the Builders category. The Brian Kilrea Coach of the Year Award, given annually to the top coach in the Canadian Hockey League, was renamed in his honor shortly after his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Kilrea won the award in 1996–97 when it was known as the CHL Coach of the Year Award.

In twenty-nine seasons with the 67&#x27;s he has only had six losing seasons – an extraordinary task in junior hockey, which due to age restrictions has a high turnover rate of players.

On September 3, 2008, Kilrea announced that 2008–09 would be his final season as coach of the 67&#x27;s, though he plans to continue serving as general manager of the club.

On March 15, 2009, Ottawa beat the Kingston Frontenacs 5–3 to give Kilrea a win in his final regular season game, giving him 1,193 wins all-time.

Kilera returned behind the bench on October 17, 2014, for the Ottawa 67&#x27;s to celebrate his 80th birthday. He became the oldest coach in hockey history, winning career game number 1,194 by a score of 6–3 against the Mississauga Steelheads.

Kilrea served as a recurring assistant coach to Don Cherry in the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game.

==Personal life==
Kilrea is a nephew of former NHL players Wally, Ken, and Hec Kilrea.

Since 1976, Kilrea has co-owned a restaurant with Nick Bouris called Chances R in Ottawa&#x27;s west end. He is an honorary member of the Rideau View Country Club, a golf club in Manotick, Ontario.

Kilrea had a heart attack on August 12, 2012, and subsequently underwent triple bypass surgery.

<text>The Hughes AIM-4 Falcon was the first operational guided air-to-air missile of the United States Air Force. Development began in 1946; the weapon was first tested in 1949. The missile entered service with the USAF in 1956.

Produced in both heat-seeking and radar-guided versions, the missile served during the Vietnam War with USAF McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II units. Designed to shoot down slow bombers with limited maneuverability, it was ineffective against maneuverable fighters over Vietnam. Lacking proximity fusing, the missile would detonate only if a direct hit was scored. Only five kills were recorded.

With the AIM-4&#x27;s poor kill record rendering the F-4D ineffective at air-to-air combat, the fighters were modified to carry the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile instead, which was already carried on USAF F-4Cs, USN and USMC F-4 Phantom II and F-8 Crusader jet fighters. The Sidewinder was more effective in the fighter vs fighter role on the F-4 platform, and improved versions continue to serve the armed forces of the United States and numerous allied nations to this day.

==Development==
===Defensive concept===
Development of a guided air-to-air missile began in 1946. Hughes Aircraft was awarded a contract for a subsonic missile under the project designation MX-798, which soon gave way to the supersonic MX-904 in 1947.

The original purpose of the weapon was as a self-defense weapon for bomber aircraft, which would carry a magazine of three missiles in the rear fuselage, and fire them through a long tube that led through the area that normally held the tail turret. In the case of the B-52, the missile contained a tuner for the bomber&#x27;s A-3 rear-facing radar, and would follow the signal being reflected off the target aircraft using a semi-active radar homing (SARH) system.

===Anti-bomber development===
At the same time that the original MX-798 had been released, a specification for a forward-firing missile for fighter aircraft had been released as MX-799. This had progressed to the point of testing prototype rounds, as the AAM-A-1 Firebird, when its subsonic speed and manual guidance were realized to be serious problems.

The project was cancelled, and the recently released MX-904 was redirected to replace Firebird in the anti-bomber role. At this stage the weapon was still designed to be fired out of a tube, now leading from a weapon bay behind the nose-mounted radar with the launch tube exiting below the radar antenna. Instead of a magazine with multiple missiles, three missiles were placed in the tube tip-to-tail.

Housing in a tube presented several problems, but primary among them was that there was no way for the missile&#x27;s seeker to lock-on before launch. The original concept would be firing against interceptor aircraft that were slowly approaching the B-52 and would be somewhere fairly close to directly behind the aircraft. In the case of a fighter, the target might not be so conveniently located, and with no way to know if it could see the target while inside the tube, this meant it might never lock-on properly.

Eventually, it was decided to abandon the tube-launched concept and mount the missile on the wings or in weapon bays that would point the missile at the target prior to launch. This change also allowed the seeker to use infrared homing as well as SARH. Interchangeable seekers were developed, allowing an aircraft to carry either type, or both. Additionally, freed from the tube, the missile&#x27;s wings were allowed to grow larger and took on the long delta form that it and its various descendants would carry into the 2000s.

===Testing and service===

The first test firings took place in 1949, at which time it was designated AAM-A-2 and given the popular name Falcon. A brief policy of assigning fighter and bomber designations to missiles led it to be redesignated F-98 in 1951. In 1955, the policy changed again, and the missile was again redesignated GAR-1.

The initial GAR-1 and GAR-2 models entered service in 1956. It armed the Northrop F-89 Scorpion, McDonnell F-101B Voodoo and Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart interceptors. The only other users were Canada, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, whose CF-101 Voodoo, Saab 35 Draken and Dassault Mirage IIIS carried the Falcon. Canada also hoped to use them on the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow interceptor; however, this was never realized because of the Arrow&#x27;s cancellation.

Fighters carrying the Falcon were often designed with internal weapons bays for carrying this missile. The Scorpion carried them on wingtip pods, while the Delta Dagger and Delta Dart had belly bays with a trapeze mechanism to move them into the airstream for launch. The F-101B had an unusual bay arrangement where two were stored externally, and then the bay door would rotate to expose two more missiles. It is likely the General Dynamics F-111&#x27;s internal bay would have accommodated the missile as well, but by the time of service the Air Force had already dropped the Falcon for use against fighters, as well as the idea of using the F-111 as an air combat fighter.

The GAR-1 had semi-active radar homing (SARH), giving a range of about . About 4,000 missiles were produced. It was replaced in production by the GAR-1D (later AIM-4A), with larger control surfaces. About 12,000 of this variant were produced, the major production version of the SARH Falcon.

The GAR-2 (later AIM-4B) was a heat-seeker, generally limited to rear-aspect engagements, but with the advantage of being a &#x27;fire and forget&#x27; weapon. As would also be Soviet practice, it was common to fire the weapon in salvos of both types to increase the chances of a hit (a heat-seeking missile fired first, followed moments later by a radar-guided missile). The GAR-2 was about 1.5 in (40 mm) longer and 16 lb (7 kg) heavier than its SARH counterpart. Its range was similar. It was replaced in production by the GAR-2A (later AIM-4C), with a more sensitive infrared seeker. A total of about 26,000 of the infrared-homing Falcons were built.

All of the early Falcons had a small 7.6 lb (3.4 kg) warhead, limiting their lethal radius. Also limiting them tactically was that Falcon lacked a proximity fuze: the fuzing for the missile was in the leading edges of the wings, requiring a direct hit to detonate.

In 1958, Hughes introduced a slightly enlarged version of the Falcon, initially dubbed Super Falcon, with a more powerful, longer-burning rocket engine, increasing speed and range. It had a larger warhead (28.7 lb / 13 kg) and better guidance systems. The SARH versions were GAR-3 (AIM-4E) and the improved GAR-3A (AIM-4F). The infrared version was the GAR-4A (AIM-4G). About 2,700 SARH missiles and 3,400 IR Super Falcons were produced, replacing most earlier versions of the weapon in service.

The Falcon was redesignated AIM-4 in September 1962.

The final version of the original Falcon was the GAR-2B (later AIM-4D), which entered service in 1963. This was intended as a fighter combat weapon, combining the lighter, smaller airframe of the earlier GAR-1/GAR-2 weapon with the improved IR seeker of the GAR-4A/AIM-4G.

An effort to address the limitations of AIM-4D led to the development in 1970 of the XAIM-4H, which had a laser proximity fuze, new warhead, and better maneuverability. It was cancelled the following year without entering service.

A larger version of the Falcon carrying a 0.25-kiloton nuclear warhead was developed as the GAR-11 (later designated the AIM-26 Falcon), while a long-range version was developed for the North American XF-108 Rapier and Lockheed YF-12 interceptors as the GAR-9 (later AIM-47 Falcon).

==Operational history==
The Air Force deployed AIM-4 in May 1967 during the Vietnam War on the new F-4D Phantom II, which carried it on the inner wing pylons and was not wired to carry the AIM-9 Sidewinder. The missile&#x27;s combat performance was very poor. The Falcon, already operational on Air Defense Command aircraft, was designed to be used against bombers, and its slow seeker cooling times (as much as six or seven seconds to obtain a lock on a target) rendered it largely ineffective against maneuvering fighters. Moreover, it could be cooled only once. Limited coolant supply meant that once cooled, the missile would expend its supply of liquid nitrogen in two minutes, rendering it useless on the rail. The missile also had a small warhead, and lacked proximity fusing. As a result, only five kills were scored, all with the AIM-4D version. (The Falcon was also experimentally fired by the F-102 Delta Dagger against ground targets at night using its infrared seeker.)


The weapon was unpopular with pilots from the onset and was supplemented or partially withdrawn in 1969, to be replaced in the F-4D by the Sidewinder after retrofitting the proper wiring. Colonel Robin Olds, USAF, commanding the F-4D-equipped 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, was an outspoken critic of the missile and said of it:
By the beginning of June, we all hated the new AIM-4 Falcon missiles. I loathed the damned useless things. I wanted my Sidewinders back. In two missions I had fired seven or eight of the bloody things and not one guided. They were worse than I had anticipated. Sometimes they refused to launch; sometimes they just cruised off into the blue without guiding. In the thick of an engagement with my head twisting and turning, trying to keep track of friend and foe, I&#x27;d forget which of the four I had (already) selected and couldn&#x27;t tell which of the remaining was perking and which head was already expiring on its launch rail. Twice upon returning to base I had the tech rep go over the switchology and firing sequences. We never discovered I was doing anything wrong.

Colonel Olds became exasperated with the Falcon&#x27;s poor combat performance. He ordered his entire fighter wing to rewire the F-4Ds to carry more reliable AIM-9 Sidewinders. Although it was an unauthorized field modification, the entire air force eventually followed his example.

===Vietnam War: U.S. AIM-4 Falcon Air to Air Victories===
Used from 1965 through 1972 in Vietnam, Falcons achieved their only kills during Operation Rolling Thunder (1965–68) , with only 5 successful hits scored after 54 launches in aerial combat.

The AIM-4 was also produced as the HM-55S (radar-guided) for the Swiss Air Force for use on the Dassault Mirage IIIS, and license-manufactured in Sweden for the Swedish Air Force (as the Rb 28) to equip the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen. The seeker of the missile was also redesigned.

The AIM-4F/AIM-4G Super Falcon remained in USAF and ANG service, primarily with Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart interceptors, until the final retirement of the F-106 in 1988. These aircraft had been designed to carry the weapon and could not be easily converted to carry larger weapons like the AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-7 Sparrow, which were much longer.

<text>The Underwood Typewriter Company was an American manufacturer of typewriters headquartered in New York City, with manufacturing facilities in Hartford, Connecticut. Underwood produced what is considered the first widely successful, modern typewriter. By 1939, Underwood had produced five million machines.

==History==

In 1874, the Underwood family made typewriter ribbon and carbon paper, and was among a number of firms that produced these goods for Remington. When Remington decided to start producing ribbons themselves, the Underwoods opted to manufacture typewriters.

The original Underwood typewriter was invented by German-American Franz Xaver Wagner, who showed it to entrepreneur John Thomas Underwood. Underwood supported Wagner and bought the company, recognizing the importance of the machine.

The Underwood Number 5 launched in 1900 has been described as &quot;the first truly modern typewriter.&quot; Two million of these typewriters had been sold by the early 1920s, and their sales “were equal in quantity to all of the other firms in the typewriter industry combined.” When the company was in its heyday as the world&#x27;s largest typewriter manufacturer, its factory in Hartford, Connecticut was turning out typewriters at the rate of one per minute and, along with Royal Typewriter Company, made Hartford the “Typewriter Capitol of the World”.

Philip Dakin Wagoner was appointed president of the Elliott-Fisher Company after World War I (1914-1918).
Elliott-Fisher became the parent company of the Underwood Typewriter Company and the Sundstrand Adding Machine Co.
In 1927 Wagoner reorganized the company into Underwood-Elliott-Fisher, which later became the Underwood Corporation. The reorganization was completed in December 1927. John Thomas Underwood was elected chairman and Wagoner president of Underwood Elliott-Fisher.

In the years before World War II, Underwood built the world&#x27;s largest typewriter in an attempt to promote itself. The typewriter was on display at Garden Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for several years and attracted large crowds. Often, Underwood would have a young woman sitting on each of the large keys. The enormous typewriter was scrapped for metal when the war started.

During World War II, Underwood produced M1 carbines. Approximately 540,000 M1 carbines were produced from late 1942 to May 1944. Underwood also produced M1 carbine barrels for the U.S. government. Under the Free Issue Barrel Program, barrels were sent to other prime manufacturers who did not possess the machines to make barrels.

In 1945 Wagoner was elected chairman of the board of Underwood, and Leon C. Stowell was elected president.
Wagoner remained chief executive.
Olivetti bought a controlling interest in Underwood in 1959, and completed the merger in October 1963, becoming known in the U.S. as Olivetti-Underwood with headquarters in New York City, and entering the electromechanical calculator business. 

By the 1970s and 1980s, the typewriter market had matured under the market dominance of large companies from Britain, Europe and the United States — but before the advent of daisy wheel and electronic machines — Underwood and the other major manufacturers faced strong competition from typewriters from Asia, including Brother Industries and Silver Seiko Ltd. of Japan. 

The Underwood brand appears in 2021 on some cash registers produced by Olivetti.

== Notable users ==
Some writers who had endorsed with Underwood typewriters such as William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Robert E. Howard.

== In popular media ==
The Underwood brand of typewriters is mentioned and seen in the TV Series &quot;House of Cards&quot;. In episode 25, main character and Vice President of the United States Frank Underwood uses an Underwood typewriter to write a letter to President Garrett Walker. In this letter, he implies his father as having been an heir to the Underwood typewriter fortune. Episode 27 reveals Frank&#x27;s father to have been named Calvin, and no Calvin Underwood ever held stake or sway over the typewriter company.

In the film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, an Underwood typewriter is used by a French police officer while being dictated to by his superior officer. In the scene the machine is filmed looking at the rear panel where the name Underwood is visible.

<text>The Order is a 2001 American action film directed by Sheldon Lettich, and written by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who also starred in the film. The film was released on direct-to-DVD in the United States on March 12, 2002.

==Plot==
The film opens in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade, depicting Christian Crusaders sacking Jerusalem and slaughtering the local population. A Flemish Christian knight named Charles Le Vaillant (Jean-Claude Van Damme) becomes demoralized by the horrors of war and decides to create a new religious order. This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-declared leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order. While traveling to Syria, his camp is attacked by the Christian knights, who kill Le Vaillant. The last chapter from their religious text, buried by Le Vaillant in a secret place, becomes lost in the desert after the attack.

In the modern day, Rudy Cafmeyer (Jean-Claude van Damme), a thief and smuggler of valuable historical artifacts, breaks into a high-security building and steals a precious Fabergé egg. He triggers an alarm in the process and is forced to fight his way out of the building, finding no car to meet him because the getaway driver, Yuri, was forced to leave by police. His problems are compounded when a potential buyer attempts to steal the egg and falls on it, destroying it.

It is revealed that Rudy&#x27;s father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar &quot;Ozzie&quot; Cafmeyer (Vernon Dobtcheff). Ozzie travels to Israel in search of a secret he has discovered and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who travels to Jerusalem to rescue him. Ozzie&#x27;s associate, Professor Walt Finley (Charlton Heston), gives Rudy the key to a safe-deposit box in East Jerusalem before being gunned down by unknown assailants. Rudy opens the safe-deposit box and finds an ancient map showing a series of tunnels and a treasure room beneath Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, a devout contingent of Le Vaillant&#x27;s followers known as the Order continues to practice his peaceful teachings in Israel. One of the disciples, Cyrus (Brian Thompson), enters into conflict with the Order&#x27;s leader Pierre Gaudet over Cyrus&#x27;s inflammatory rhetoric regarding an imminent holy war. Cyrus has Pierre Gaudet killed using a car bomb and assumes control of the Order.

Israeli Police Chief Ben Ner (Ben Cross) views Rudy&#x27;s arrival with hostility and takes steps to have Rudy deported, appointing Lt. Dalia Barr (Sofia Milos) to ensure that Rudy does not escape. Lt. Barr escorts Rudy to the airplane but Ben Ner calls and demands their return, claiming that Rudy is smuggling an artifact. Lt. Barr knows that Rudy has been searched and is not in possession of any artifacts so she unlocks Rudy&#x27;s handcuffs and lets him escape in a feigned struggle, meeting up with him again after he escapes from the airport in a stolen ramp-towing vehicle. Lt. Barr reveals that she was once a disciple of the Order but that she left when she was 18. Together they visit Yuri, who translates the map and explains that it leads to treasure, but thieves break in and steal the map, shooting and killing Yuri in the process. Rudy steals a motorcycle and pursues the thief who has the map. He catches up with him and shoots him, causing the thief to drop the map, but is also shot and injured.

Rudy hides from the police and is found by Lt. Barr, who drives him to be helped back to health by her old friend Avram, who is still a member of the Order. Lt. Barr gives Rudy papers left by his father in which Ozzie explains he had discovered the lost manuscripts of the Order, lost since the Crusades, and that the new sect within the Order does not wish for them to be revealed because they show the location of a mythical Jewish treasure. Rudy shows it to Avram, who insists that the &quot;treasure&quot; is merely a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages and says that its location in the Order&#x27;s monastery cannot be accessed by outsiders anyway. With Avram&#x27;s aid Rudy and Lt. Barr pose as foreign members of the Order visiting on a pilgrimage in order to gain access to the monastery during a massive assembly of the members, now led by Cyrus.

In the catacombs Rudy finds the remaining manuscripts as well as his imprisoned father and a large bomb. Ben Ner arrives and explains to Rudy and Lt. Barr that he joined the Order when he found out about the treasure. Cyrus arrives and forces Ozzie to lead him through the tunnels in order to detonate the bomb under the Temple Mount during Ramadan to maximize casualties and make martyrs of the Israeli Lt. Barr and American Rudy Cafmeyer in order to trigger World War III. Rudy saves Avram from falling into a pit trap before they reach a room loaded with treasure next to the chamber underneath the Well of Souls. Ben Ner attempts to delay the detonation in order to collect more treasure, leading to a standoff with Cyrus&#x27;s followers. Rudy, and Lt. Barr use the opportunity to escape but Ozzy is injured and Avram is killed. Lt. Barr shoots Ben Ner and helps Ozzie out of the catacombs. Rudy catches Cyrus in the treasure room and kills him with one of the swords found there. Rudy moves the bomb from under the Well of Souls and drops it into the pit trap. Ben Ner jumps at Rudy but only grabs his shirt and tears it off as he falls into the pit. Rudy races away from the pit as the bomb explodes. Worshipers above hear the explosion but continue praying.

Rudy is later shown visiting the office of his father, who has published a new book. In the office Rudy finds an ancient map that Ozzie claims shows the location of the Seven Cities of Gold. Rudy grabs the map and runs out of the office with Dalia. The film ends with a compilation of quick action cuts as well as a few outtakes.

==Production==
Director Sheldon Lettich later recalled:
Tonally we wanted to make a movie that was in the vein of &quot;fun&quot; action-adventure movies like the Indiana Jones films and Hitchcock movies like &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. One big mistake that we made with &quot;The Order&quot; was taking the tone in a more serious direction in the third act. Had we maintained the light-heartedness all the way to the end, I believe the film would have been far more successful. For me the highlight of that movie is the chase through the Old City of Jerusalem, with Van Damme disguised as a Hasidic Jew, running from and fighting with the Israeli police. It was utterly wacky and outrageous, and to this day I&#x27;m still amazed that I convinced Jean-Claude to do it.

==Box office==
In Spain the movie was seen by well over 100,000 people with a total gross of almost 600,000 euros. In Mexico the movie did just as well, grossing over $560,000. Though not issued in cinemas in the United States, the movie did well on rentals, netting over $18 million. &quot;The Order&quot; was also issued on Video and DVD in the United Kingdom and Germany.

<doc id="1193400" wikidata="Q4009809" url="?curid=1193400" title="Vera Katz">
<text>Vera Katz (née Pistrak; August 3, 1933 – December 11, 2017) was an American Democratic politician in the state of Oregon. She was the first woman to serve as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives and was the 49th mayor of Portland, Oregon&#x27;s most populous city. She grew up in New York City, moving to Portland in 1962, and was elected to the Oregon House in 1972. She served as mayor from 1993 to 2005.

==Early life==
Vera Katz was born on August 3, 1933, as Vera Pistrak in Düsseldorf, Germany. Her parents, Elizar (&quot;Lazar Michael Pistrak&quot;; 1896–1985) and Raissa (1896–1986), fled Moscow, Russia, after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, settling in Germany. As Jewish Mensheviks, the family, including Vera&#x27;s elder sister, Senaida (&quot;Zena&quot;; born March 5, 1925), fled for France when Vera was two months old as Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power.

Once World War II began and Hitler invaded France, the family of four fled over the Pyrenees Mountains to Spain on foot. After a time the family was able to emigrate to the United States, sailing on the ship &quot;Nea Hellas&quot; in 1940. They settled in Brooklyn. Vera&#x27;s parents later divorced when she was 12 years old, and her mother was known as Raissa Goodman for the remainder of her life.

===Education===

Katz earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Brooklyn College in 1955 and a Master of Arts degree in 1957. She worked as a camp counselor in upstate New York where she met her future husband, Mel Katz, a waiter and artist. They moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1962 after selecting Portland from a list that included Seattle, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.

After they moved, she gave birth to a son, Jesse. Jesse went on to graduate from Lincoln High School in 1981 and became a journalist in Los Angeles; his memoir, &quot;The Opposite Field&quot;, was published in October 2009.

==Early political activities==
Katz became involved in politics in the late 1960s while working on the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy had antagonized many in Portland through his aggressive pursuit of local corruption as United States Attorney General. Katz moved on to support the nationwide grape boycott organized in the late 1960s by Cesar Chavez to support migrant agricultural workers. She then protested and picketed the City Club of Portland over their male-only membership requirement in the early 1970s, leading to the end of the practice by the private club.

==Political career==

In 1972, Vera Katz was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat representing Portland and Multnomah County for the 1973 session. She won re-election to additional two-year terms through 1990.

In 1985, she became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the Oregon House, replacing Grattan Kerans. While in the Oregon House, she sponsored the Oregon Educational Act for the 21st Century, a landmark school reform bill. She also helped pass measures on gun control as well as legislation prohibiting discrimination based on gender in places of public accommodation and credit. Katz was the first person in Oregon history to hold the position of Speaker for three straight sessions.

===Mayor of Portland===
In 1992, Katz ran for mayor of Portland, promoting her candidacy by using public transportation to commute to her office. Running against then city commissioner Earl Blumenauer, she campaigned on a platform that included reducing crime rates. She won the election and served three terms, from January 1993 until January 2005, winning re-election in 1996 and 2000.

During her first term, Mayor Katz endorsed the Yellow Bike Project, which drew national attention to Portland&#x27;s artistic and bike-friendly civic engagement culture. In 2004, she did not run for re-election and Tom Potter was elected as mayor in November 2004, assuming office in January 2005. During her administration, Katz pursued a policy of revitalization of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods.

Katz fought off the early stages of breast cancer in early 2000, with surgery and radiation treatment. Katz was subsequently diagnosed with a rare form of uterine cancer called adenosarcoma in June 2004, following a hysterectomy. While her cancer was beaten, treatment of her uterine cancer damaged Katz&#x27;s kidneys and she subsequently was forced to undergo kidney dialysis three times a week for the rest of her life.

==Later years==
Vera and Mel Katz divorced in 1985; their son, Jesse, went on to a career in journalism.

In January 2005, the former mayor began an unpaid position as a Dean&#x27;s Visiting Fellow in the College of Urban and Public Affairs&#x27; Institute of Portland Metropolitan Studies at Portland State University. From 2008 until her death in 2017, she volunteered for the Start Making A Reader Today literacy program in the Portland area.

In her final job, which she began in 2008, Katz worked as a lobbyist for the public relations firm Gallatin Public Affairs. Despite limited mobility in her declining years, Katz would remain with the firm until her retirement in 2012.

==Death and legacy==

Katz died peacefully in her sleep around 4 am on December 11, 2017, in Portland one week after being diagnosed with leukemia. She was 84 years old at the time of her death. Katz was survived by her son, Jesse Katz, a Los Angeles journalist; her grandson Max Katz; her former husband, Mel Katz; and her elder sister, Zena Linden.

At the time of her death, Katz was eulogized in an editorial in the Portland &quot;Oregonian,&quot; which declared:
During her three terms as mayor from 1992 to 2004, Katz altered the shape, look and dynamism of the city, helping to put it right up there with Brooklyn as a magnet for young people. She worked night and day on Portland, as feverishly if she were touching up her personal masterpiece and, in many ways, she was.

Katz was remembered as a detail-oriented and energetic public servant. She was instrumental in the development of a multi-use pathway, now known as the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, a river walk 30 feet above the Willamette River which runs from the Hawthorne Bridge to the Steel Bridge and is part of the Portland Parks system. The Esplanade, construction of which was completed in May 2001, was named for Katz in November 2004 in honor of her civic achievement. A bronze statue of Katz by sculptor Bill Bane was added to the project in 2006.

<text>The foreign relations of [[Chinese Empire|Imperial China]] from the Qin dynasty until the Qing dynasty encompassed many situations as the fortunes of dynasties rose and fell. Chinese culture had influenced neighboring and distant countries, while being transformed by outside influences as well as being conquered. During the Western Han dynasty, the Silk Road trade routes were established and brought Hellenistic Central Asia, Persia under the Parthian Empire, and South Asia into contact with the Chinese empire. During the 2nd century BC, Zhang Qian became the first known Chinese diplomat to venture deep into Central Asia in search of allies against the Mongolic Xiongnu confederation. Han Chinese attempts were made at reaching the Roman Empire and although the mission led by Gan Ying in 97 AD was a failure, Chinese historical records nevertheless maintain that the Romans traveled to southern China and Vietnam via the Indian Ocean. Buddhism from India was introduced to China during the Eastern Han period and would spread to neighboring Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, all of which would adopt similar Confucian cultures based on the Chinese model.

Following the fall of Sasanian Persia to the Rashidun Caliphate, Chinese contacts with the Islamic world were initiated during the Tang dynasty. Foreign faiths entered China at this time, such as Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity and Islam, although Chinese Buddhism and Taoism remained prominent. The Song dynasty dealt on a basis of equality with the neighboring Liao and Jin dynasties until falling to the Mongol conquest. The Mongol Empire became the dominant state in Asia, and the Pax Mongolica encouraged trade of goods, ideas, and technologies from east to west during the early and mid-13th century. Marco Polo could safely travel back and forth, for instance. The Mongol-led Yuan dynasty founded by Kublai Khan ruled from the capital of Khanbaliq (modern Beijing). The Yuan dynasty&#x27;s failed diplomacy with the Kamakura Shogunate of Japan led to the Mongol invasions of Japan, which also ended in failure for the Yuan Empire.

Following the collapse of the Yuan dynasty and the formation of the Ming dynasty by the Hongwu Emperor in 1368, imperial Chinese power was projected abroad with the 15th-century Chinese treasure fleet of Admiral Zheng He. As representatives of the Yongle Emperor, Zheng&#x27;s fleet sailed throughout Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean and to East Africa exacting tribute, granting lavish gifts to vassal states, and even invaded Sri Lanka. However, the fleet was later dismantled and the Ming emperors thereafter fostered &quot;Haijin&quot; isolationist policies that limited international trade and foreign contacts to a handful of seaports and other locations. These policies saw a gradual reversal after the arrival of European explorers such as Jorge Álvares (the first foreigner to travel to China by sea) and Rafael Perestrello and, although a war was initially fought against the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese were granted a colonial settlement at Macau in the 16th century. Catholic Jesuit missions in China were also introduced, with Matteo Ricci being the first European allowed to enter the Forbidden City of the Ming emperors in Beijing. During the subsequent Qing dynasty Jesuits from Europe such as Giuseppe Castiglione gained favor at court until the Chinese Rites controversy and most missionaries were expelled in 1706.

The dissolution of the Mongol empire in the fourteenth century made Central Asian trade routes dangerous and forced Western European powers to explore ocean routes. European powers, including the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch began trading with China in the early 17th century. The Qing court moved to control this burgeoning trade with the Europeans by creating the Canton System in 1756, granting a monopoly of trade to the merchants of the Thirteen Factories and restricted it to Canton (as Guangzhou was then known) in the south. The British Macartney Embassy of 1793 failed to convince the Qianlong Emperor to open northern Chinese ports for foreign trade or establish direct relations. Britain&#x27;s growing importation of Chinese goods such as tea was offset by their illicit sale of opium to Chinese smugglers. However, the Qing unilateral banning of the sale of opium led to the Opium Wars and Chinese defeat. The 1842 Treaty of Nanking replaced the Canton system with a series of treaty ports, ending the tributary system as well.

== Background ==
In premodern times, the theory of foreign relations of China held that the Chinese Empire was the Celestial Dynasty, the center of world civilization, with the Emperor of China being the leader of the civilized world. This view saw China as equivalent to &quot;all under heaven&quot;. All other states were considered to be tributaries, under the suzerain rule of China. Some were direct vassals. Theoretically, the lands around the imperial capital were regarded as &quot;five zones of submission&quot;, - the circular areas differentiated according to the strength of the benevolent influence from the Son of Heaven.

There were several periods when Chinese foreign policy took on isolationist tones, because of the view that the rest of the world was poor and backward with little to offer.

Nevertheless, China was a center of trade from early on in its history. Many of China&#x27;s interactions with the outside world came via the Silk Road. This included, during the 2nd century AD, contact with representatives of the Roman Empire, and during the 13th century, the visits of Venetian traveler Marco Polo.

Chinese foreign policy was usually aimed at containing the threat of so-called &quot;barbarian&quot; invaders (such as the Xiongnu, Mongols, and Jurchen) from the north. This could be done by military means, such as an active offense (campaigns into the north) or a more passive defense (as exemplified by the Great Wall of China). The Chinese also arranged marriage alliances known as &quot;heqin&quot;, or &quot;peace marriages.&quot;

Chinese officers distinguished between &quot;matured/familiar barbarians&quot; (foreigners influenced by Chinese culture) and &quot;raw barbarians&quot;.

In many periods, Chinese foreign policy was especially assertive. One such case was exemplified by the treasure voyages of Admiral Zheng He during the Ming dynasty.

==Qin dynasty==

Although many kings of the Shang and Zhou dynasties ruled beforehand, in 221 BC, the ruler of the Qin state, Ying Zheng (Qin Shi Huang), was the first to conquer the different vassal states under the Zhou dynasty, as well as other non-sinicized states. He was able to transform these different states into a relatively unified and uniform empire, the Qin Empire. Under his leadership and a society modelled around strict adherence to legalist philosophy, his once backwater western frontier state conquered all of the rivaling Warring States in ancient China. The Chinese domain was also extended into Inner Mongolia and Manchuria to the north, and with naval expeditions sent to the south, the indigenous Baiyue of modern-day Guangdong and northern Vietnam (the latter called Jiaozhi, and then Annam during the Tang dynasty) were also quelled and brought under Chinese rule.

==Han dynasty==
The time of the Han dynasty (202 BC–AD 220) was a groundbreaking era in the history of Imperial China&#x27;s foreign relations, during the long reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC), the travels of the diplomat Zhang Qian opened up China&#x27;s relations with many different Asian territories for the first time. While traveling to the Western Regions in order to seek out an alliance with the Yuezhi against the Xiongnu, Zhang Qian was imprisoned by the Xiongnu for many years, but he brought back detailed reports of lands that had been previously unknown to the Chinese. This included details of his travels to the Greek-Hellenized kingdoms of Fergana (Dayuan) and the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (Daxia), as well as reports of Anxi (Persian Empire of Parthia), Tiaozhi (Mesopotamia), Shendu (India), and the Wusun Central Asian nomads. After his travels, the famous land trading route of the Silk Road leading from China to the Roman Empire was established. Emperor Wu was also known for his conquests and successful campaigns against the Xiongnu. He warred against the Kingdom of Wiman Joseon in order to establish the Four Commanderies of Han in Manchuria, one of which was established in northern Korea, the Lelang Commandery. The empire began expanding into southern China and northern Vietnam, then the territory of the Baiyue kingdoms. The Han Empire absorbed Minyue after defeating the state, and annexed the Dian in Yunnan. By 111 BC, Emperor Wu conquered the Nanyue kingdom in the Han–Nanyue War. Nanyue was ruled by the Triệu dynasty since the Qin naval officer Zhao Tuo had broken ties with mainland rule in the fall of Qin and establishment of Han.

Yet Chinese trading missions to follow were not limited to travelling across land and terrain. During the 2nd century BC, the Chinese had sailed past Southeast Asia and into the Indian Ocean, reaching India and Sri Lanka by sea before the Romans. This sea route became well traveled not only by merchants and diplomats, but also Chinese religious missionaries in search of further Indian Buddhist texts to translate from Sanskrit to Chinese. In AD 148, the Parthian prince known as An Shigao was the first to translate Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. There were many other Buddhist missionaries as well, including Yuezhi missionaries and Kushan Buddhist missionaries from northern India who introduced Buddhism to China. Emperor Ming establishing the White Horse Temple in the 1st century AD is demarcated by the 6th-century Chinese writer Yang Xuanzhi as the official introduction of Buddhism to China. Also by the 1st century AD, the Chinese made sea contacts with Yayoi Japan, inhabited by what the Chinese termed as the Wa people. By the 1st century, the Chinese also established relations with the Kingdom of Funan, centered in what is now Cambodia, but stretched partly into Burma, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The Han general Ban Chao (AD 32–102) reconquered the states in the Western Regions (the modern day Tarim Basin in Xinjiang) after pushing the Xiongnu out of the region. This included the kingdoms of Kashgar, Loulan, and Khotan, which were returned to Chinese control. He also sent his emissary Gan Ying even further in order to reach Rome (Daqin). Gan Ying made it as far as the Persian Gulf in the Parthian Empire, but was falsely convinced by Parthian hosts that Rome could only be reached by sailing around the Arabian peninsula. He did however bring back reports of the Roman Empire and its Mediterranean civilization to the Han royal court, and there is evidence that subsequent Roman embassies to China took place.

==Period of Disunity==

Although introduced during the Han dynasty, the chaotic, divisionary Period of Disunity (220–589) saw a flourishing of Buddhism and travels to foreign regions inspired by Buddhist missionaries. There were Indian monks such as Kumarajiva (344–413) from Kucha who traveled to China in order to translate Sanskrit texts into Chinese. There were also many Chinese who traveled abroad in order to obtain and translate Buddhist sutras into Chinese, such as the Chinese monk Faxian (337–422), who in his old age traveled to Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal. From China, Buddhism entered Korea by 372. It was first practiced in the northern state of Goguryeo, and would eventually develop into distinctive Korean Buddhism. As recorded in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Buddhism in Japan was introduced by 552 with a religious mission sent by Seong of Baekje, ruler of one of the three Korean kingdoms.

===Three Kingdoms===

The Three Kingdoms era (220–280) was a period of Chinese history consumed by incessant warfare amongst a triad of rival claimants to the Han legacy. The triple schism of China into three warring states made engaging in costly conflict a necessity, so they could not heavily commit themselves to issues and concerns of traveling abroad. The state of Shu Han in the west conquered the Hmong people to the southwest, then known as the Nanman. There was another recorded Roman embassy to China that visited the court of Cao Rui (226–239) in the northern state of Cao Wei, most likely sent by Alexander Severus. Another Roman embassy was recorded in 284, most likely sent by Carus; this was the last Sino-Roman contact recorded by the Chinese.

===Jin dynasty===

The Jin dynasty was established in 265 (after conquering Shu Han) by the noble Sima family that had once served the state of Cao Wei, and conquered the state of Eastern Wu in 280, thus ending the Three Kingdoms era. However, the state was weakened and left vulnerable with the War of the Eight Princes from 291 to 306. This allowed for sinicized Xiongnu nomads to capture both of China&#x27;s historical capitals at Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an, forcing the remnants of the Jin court to flee south to Jiankang (present-day Nanjing). The Xiongnu then established rule in the north under the Han-Zhao kingdom. The Jin dynasty period saw a continuing flourishing of Buddhism and Buddhist travel.

===Southern and Northern dynasties===

Like the Three Kingdoms period before it, the Southern and Northern dynasties period (420–589), but also saw the flourishing of Buddhist sites along the Silk Road. This includes Buddhist sites such as the Yungang Grottoes, the Longmen Grottoes, and the Mogao Caves.

==Sui dynasty==
Yang Jian (Emperor Wen) ruled in northern China from 581, and conquered the Chen dynasty in the south by 589, hence reunifying China under the Sui dynasty (581–618). He and his successor Emperor Yang initiated several military campaigns.

Northern Vietnam was retaken by conquest, while there was a temporary occupation of the Champa kingdom in southern Vietnam. They launched unsuccessful campaigns against the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo during the Three Kingdoms of Korea, depleting not only troops but ultimately much of the government&#x27;s revenue.

The Grand Canal was completed during the Sui dynasty, enhancing indigenous trade between northern and southern China by canal and river traffic.
One of the diplomatic highlights of this short-lived dynastic period was Prince Shōtoku&#x27;s Japanese embassy to China led by Ono no Imoko in AD 607.

Prince Shōtoku made his queen Suiko call herself Empress, and claimed an equal footing with the Chinese Emperor who regarded himself as the only Emperor in the world at that time. Thus Shōtoku broke with Chinese principle that a non-Chinese sovereign was only allowed to call himself king but not emperor.

Emperor Yang thought of this Japanese behavior as &#x27;insolent&#x27;, because it opposed his Sinocentric worldview, but finally, he had to accept it and send an embassy to Japan in the next year as he had to avoid conflict with Japan to prepare for the conquest of Goguryeo.

==Tang dynasty==

The Tang dynasty (618–907) represents another high point for China in terms of its military might, conquest and establishment of vassals and tributaries, foreign trade, and its central political position and preeminent cultural status in East Asia.

One of the most ambitious rulers of the dynasty was Emperor Taizong (r. 626–649). He initiated several significant war campaigns in Chinese history, most of them against powerful Turkic groups of Central Asia. This includes campaigns against Eastern Tujue, Tuyuhun, and the Xueyantuo. Armies were dispatched to invade the oasis states of the Tarim Basin. The kingdom of Karasahr was captured by Tang forces in 644 and the kingdom of Kucha was conquered in 649. The western expansion of the Tang Empire continued under Emperor Taizong&#x27;s successor, Emperor Gaozong, who conquered the Western Turks in 657, led by the Turkic qaghan Ashina Helu, with an army under the command of General Su Dingfang.

In a formidable alliance with the Korean kingdom Silla, a combined Tang-Silla fleet made a decisive victory over the Korean kingdom Baekje and her Yamato Japanese allies in the naval Battle of Baekgang in 663. Emperor Taizong also invaded Goguryeo in an effort to help their Unified Silla ally crush its rival, Goguryeo, to the north. Emperor Taizong&#x27;s other intention in invading northern Korea was to secure territory of Lelang Commandery, an old Chinese commandery in northern Korea that had been lost since Goguryeo captured it from the Jin dynasty in the 313. However, Goguryeo&#x27;s territory fell into the hands of Silla and Balhae instead of the Tang Empire.

Chinese trade relations during the Tang dynasty was extended further west to the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, and Egypt. Many contemporary writers from foreign countries described Chinese ships, Chinese goods brought to foreign ports, as well as Chinese seaports. Amongst the Chinese authors, the writer Duan Chengshi (died 863) described trade in Somalia and between 785 and 805 the Chinese geographer Jia Dan described lighthouses that were erected in the Persian Gulf, confirmed later by Muslim writers al-Mas&#x27;udi and al-Muqaddasi. The introduction of Islam in China began during the reign of Emperor Gaozong (r. 649–683), with missionaries such as Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, a maternal uncle of Muhammad. The seaport at Guangzhou in southern China became one of the largest seaports in the world, hosting foreign travelers throughout maritime Asia. At the time, Guangzhou was a major port along the maritime silk road and involved in heavy trade with Japan. The Tang capital city of Chang&#x27;an became well known as a multicultural metropolis filled with foreign travelers, dignitaries, merchants, emissaries, and missionaries. Chinese Buddhist monks such as Xuanzang (died 664) continued to travel abroad to places like India in order to gain wisdom, collect Buddhist relics, and translate additional sutras into Chinese.

Although the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–756) is seen as the zenith point of the Tang dynasty, it was during the last years of his reign that one of the most destructive rebellions in Chinese history occurred. The Tang Empire had recruited many Central Asian Turks into their armed forces. One of these was An Lushan (703–757), a Sogdian-Turk who became a military commander and personal favorite of Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s concubine Consort Yang. He instigated the An Lushan Rebellion, which caused the deaths of millions of people, cost the Tang dynasty their Central Asian possessions, and allowed the Tibetans to invade China and temporarily occupy the capital, Chang&#x27;an. The Tang dynasty recovered under Emperor Xianzong (805–820) but it never achieved its former martial and political strength. The unintended effect of the rebellion, however, was the loosening of government restrictions on trade. Although the 9th century was politically turbulent, the economy of China actually continued to thrive, bolstered still by foreign trade. The Japanese were sending embassies to the Tang Empire as late as 894, which was finally halted by Emperor Uda by the persuasion of Sugawara no Michizane.

==Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms==

The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907–960) period was an age of division and Chinese civil war between the unified Tang and Song dynasties. It is notable for the introduction of Greek Fire (or a formula similar to the original) from Chinese contacts in Arabia. Greek Fire was then applied to the new Chinese invention of the double-piston pump flamethrower, used in battle during the Five Dynasties era and Song dynasty.

==Song dynasty==

The Chinese political theory of China being the center of world diplomacy was largely accepted in East Asia, except in periods of Chinese weakness such as the Song dynasty (960–1279).

During the Northern Song dynasty (960–1279), the Chinese emperors were forced to accept the emperors of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, as their equals. After the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty toppled the Liao dynasty in a rebellion aided by the Song dynasty, they turned against Song and conquered northern China as far south as the Huai River in the Jin–Song Wars.

The imperial court of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) was then forced to acknowledge the Jurchen rulers of the Jin dynasty as their superiors. The Mongols conquered the Jin dynasty in 1234 with the aid of the Song dynasty, which itself was also conquered by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan by 1279.

With powerful dynasties to its north such as the Tangut-led Western Xia, the Song dynasty was forced to engage in skillful diplomacy. The famous statesmen and scientists Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) were both sent as Song ambassadors to the Liao dynasty in order to settle border disputes. Shen Kuo asserted the Song dynasty&#x27;s rightful borders in the north by dredging up old archived court documents and signed agreements between the Song and Liao dynasties. Su Song asserted the Song dynasty&#x27;s rightful borders in a similar way, only he used his extensive knowledge of cartography and maps to solve a heated border dispute.

Chinese maritime trade increased dramatically during the Song dynasty, with the bustling seaport at Quanzhou taking the lead. Maritime trade abroad was augmented by a booming shipbuilding industry in Fujian province. It was also enhanced by an economic revolution in Song China and the presence of many wealthy, willing investors of maritime trade missions. There were several notable diplomatic missions sent to China from foreign countries during the Song dynasty. This included the embassy of Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah of Fatimid Egypt to the court of Emperor Zhenzong in 1008, as well as the embassy of Emperor Kulothunga Chola I of the Imperial Indian Chola dynasty to the court of Emperor Shenzong in 1077.

Although the golden age of Chinese Buddhism ended during the Tang dynasty, there were still influential Chinese Buddhist monks. This included the Zen Buddhist monk Wuzhun Shifan (1178–1249), who taught Japanese disciples such as Enni Ben&#x27;en (1201–1280). After returning to Japan from China, the latter contributed to the spread of Zen teaching in Japan and aided in the establishment of Tōfuku-ji.

==Yuan dynasty==
The Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) of China was the easternmost part of the vast Mongol Empire (stretching from East Asia to Eastern Europe), which became politically separated into four khanates beginning with the succession war in 1260. The Mongol leaders Genghis Khan, Ögedei Khan, Möngke Khan, and Hulagu Khan were able to conquer the Tangut-led Western Xia dynasty and the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in northern China, as well as invading Korea under the Goryeo dynasty, turning it into a vassal state that was ruled indirectly. The Mongols withdrew after Korean monarchs agreed to move its capital back to the mainland from Ganghwa Island.

It was the Yuan founding emperor Kublai who finally conquered the Southern Song dynasty in 1279. Kublai was an ambitious leader who used ethnic Korean, Han, and Mongol troops to invade Japan on two separate occasions, yet both campaigns were ultimately failures.

The Yuan dynasty continued the maritime trading legacy of the Tang and Song dynasties. The Yuan ship captain known as Wang Dayuan (fl. 1328–1339) was the first from China to travel by sea through the Mediterranean upon his visit to Morocco in North Africa. One of the diplomatic highlights of this period was the Chinese embassy to the Khmer Empire under Indravarman III, led by the envoy Zhou Daguan (1266–1346) from the years 1296 to 1297. In his report to the Yuan court, Zhou Daguan described places such as Angkor Wat and everyday life of the Khmer Empire. It was during the early years of Kublai Khan&#x27;s reign that Marco Polo (1254–1324) visited China, presumably as far as the previous Song capital at Hangzhou, which he described with a great deal of admiration for its scenic beauty.

==Ming dynasty==

The Ming dynasty (1368–1644), after the Han and Tang dynasties, was another high point in Chinese power. The first Ming emperor, the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368–1398), was the head of the Red Turban Rebellion when he routed the rival rebel Chinese leaders and then forced the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty to flee north, back into the Mongolian steppe. The Ming dynasty made a string of conflicts with the Mongols thereafter, some of which were successful, and others of which were not. An example of the latter would be the Tumu Crisis in 1449, where the Zhengtong Emperor was captured by the Mongols and not released until a year later.

The Hongwu Emperor allowed foreign envoys to visit the capitals at Nanjing and Beijing, but enacted strict legal prohibitions of private maritime trade by Chinese merchants wishing to travel abroad. After the death of Timur, who intended to invade China, the relations between the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s China and Shakhrukh&#x27;s state in Persia and Transoxania state considerably improved. Both the Chinese envoy to Samarkand and Herat, Chen Cheng, and his opposite party, Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh, left detailed accounts of their visits to each other&#x27;s country.

The greatest diplomatic highlights of the Ming period were the enormous maritime tributary missions and expeditions of the admiral Zheng He (1371–1433), a favored court eunuch of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424). Zheng He&#x27;s missions docked at ports throughout much of the Asian world, including those in Borneo, the Malay state of the Malacca Sultanate, Sri Lanka, India, Persia, Arabia, and East Africa. Meanwhile, the Chinese under the Yongle Emperor invaded northern Vietnam in 1402, and remained there until 1428, when Lê Lợi led a successful native rebellion against the Chinese occupiers.
Large tributary missions such as these were halted after Zheng He, with periods of isolationism in the Ming dynasty, coupled with the need to defend China&#x27;s large eastern coastal areas against marauding &quot;wokou&quot; pirates. Although it was severely limited by the state, trade was overall not forbidden. After 1578, it was completely liberalized. Upon their arrival in the early 16th century, the Portuguese Empire traded with the Chinese at Tamão, despite some hostilities exchanged between both sides. The Chinese also traded avidly with the Spanish, sending numerous trade ships annually to the Philippines in order to sell them Chinese goods in exchange for mita-mined silver from the New World colonies of Spain. There was so much Spanish silver entering China that the Spanish minted silver currency became commonplace in Ming China. The Chinese attempted to convert the silver currency back to copper currency, but the economic damage was done.

In 1524, Beijing was visited by representatives of the Ottoman Empire.

Meanwhile, the Chinese under the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) became engaged in a somewhat costly war defending Joseon Korea against Japan. The Japanese regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598) and his predecessor Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582) brought about the prosperous Azuchi-Momoyama period in feudal Japan, putting an end to the turbulent era of the Sengoku period. However, the Japanese staged an enormous invasion of Korea from 1592 to 1598. The aim of the Japanese was to ultimately invade prosperous Ming China, but in order to do so it would need to use the Korean Peninsula as a staging ground. Throughout the war, though, the Ming forces suffered significant casualties, and had spent a great deal of revenue sending troops on land into Korea and bolstering the Korean navy in battles such as the Battle of Noryang Point. The Japanese were finally defeated and withdrew.

The decline of Ming China&#x27;s economy by inflation was made worse by crop failure, famine, sudden plague, and agrarian rebellion led by those such as Li Zicheng (1606–1644), and the Ming dynasty fell in 1644. The Ming general Wu Sangui (1612–1678) was going to side with the rebels under Li, but felt betrayed when his concubine Chen Yuanyuan was taken by Li, and so allowed the Manchus, led by Prince Dorgon, to enter a northern pass and invade northern China from their base in Manchuria.

The first Jesuit missionaries to visit China did so during the Ming dynasty. The most prominent one was the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552–1610). Matteo Ricci is famous in China and the West for many reasons. He was the first to translate the Chinese classic texts into a Western language (Latin), and the first to translate the name of the most prominent Chinese philosopher Kong Qiu as &quot;Confucius&quot;. Along with another Jesuit father, he was the first European to enter the Forbidden City of Beijing during the reign of the Wanli Emperor. Matteo Ricci and his baptized Chinese colleague, the mathematician, astronomer, and agronomist Xu Guangqi (1562–1633), were the first to translate the ancient Greek mathematical treatise of &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot; into Chinese.

==Early Qing dynasty to 1800==
The long-lasting Chinese Rites controversy of the 17th and 18th centuries led the pope in 1704 to reverse the Jesuit position and reject any recognition of traditional Chinese rituals regarding ancestors and Confucianism. The Emperor thereupon banished all missionaries who followed the pope&#x27;s policy. The pope&#x27;s decision was finally reversed in 1939.

One issue facing Western embassies to China was the act of prostration known as the kowtow. Western diplomats understood that kowtowing meant accepting the superiority of the Emperor of China over their own monarchs, an act which they found unacceptable. In 1665, Russian explorers met the Manchus in what is today northeastern China. Using the common language of Latin, which the Chinese had learned from Jesuit missionaries, the Kangxi Emperor of China and Tsar Peter I of the Russian Empire negotiated the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, which delineated the borders between Russia and China, some sections of which still exist today.

Russia was not dealt with through the Ministry of Tributary Affairs, but rather through the same ministry as the problematic Mongols, which served to acknowledge Russia&#x27;s status as a nontributary nation. From then on, the Chinese worldview of all other nations as tributaries began to unravel.
 
In 1793, the Qianlong Emperor rejected an offer of expanded trade and foreign relations by the British diplomat George Macartney. A Dutch embassy was the last occasion in which any European appeared before the Chinese imperial court within the context of traditional Chinese imperial foreign relations.

While maintaining foreign relations is crucial in safeguarding economic and political strength, the Imperial Court had little incentive to appease the European nations at the time. Evidenced in the book &quot;The Great Divergence&quot; by Professor Kenneth Pomeranz, the infrastructure surrounding China&#x27;s economy was far more durable than its European counterparts. The capability for multiple Chinese markets to satisfy domestic needs and compete globally enabled independent innovation and development outside the European sphere of influence. Given the high quality of life, adequate sanitation, and a strong internal agricultural sector, the Chinese government had no significant motivation to satisfy any demands imposed by western powers.

Representing Dutch and Dutch East India Company interests, Isaac Titsingh traveled to Beijing in 1794–96 for celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign. The Titsingh delegation also included the Dutch-American Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, whose detailed description of this embassy to the Chinese imperial court was soon after published in the United States and Europe. Titsingh&#x27;s French translator, Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes published his own account of the Titsingh mission in 1808. &quot;Voyage a Pékin, Manille et l&#x27;Ile de France&quot; provided an alternate perspective and a counterpoint to other reports which were then circulating. Titsingh himself died before he could publish his version of events.

The Chinese worldview changed very little during the Qing dynasty as China&#x27;s sinocentric perspectives continued to be informed and reinforced by deliberate policies and practices designed to minimize any evidence of its growing weakness and West&#x27;s evolving power. After the Titsingh mission, no further non-Asian ambassadors were allowed even to approach the Qing capital until the consequences of the First and Second Opium Wars changed everything.

<text>Robin Rhodes Millhouse, QC (9 December 1929 – 28 April 2017) was, at various times, the 39th Attorney-General of South Australia, the first Australian Democrats parliamentarian, and the Chief Justice of both Kiribati and Nauru and a judge of the High Court of Tuvalu.

==Early life and career==
Millhouse was born in Adelaide, to lawyer Vivian Rhodes Millhouse (1902–1963), and Grace Lily (often Lilly) Millhouse, née Ayliffe (1900–1990). Millhouse gained an LLB from the University of Adelaide in 1951 after attending St Peter&#x27;s College, Adelaide.

==Political career==
While practising as a barrister, Millhouse entered the South Australian House of Assembly on 7 May 1955 as the Liberal and Country League (LCL) member for Mitcham, a safe LCL seat in southeastern Adelaide. Millhouse rapidly gained a reputation as both the intellectual driving force behind the LCL and an outspoken spokesperson for the urban middle class faction of the LCL, a group under-represented within the party hierarchy.

Millhouse ran for the LCL leadership pre-selection after the leader Sir Thomas Playford&#x27;s retirement but lost to Steele Hall, another member of the LCL&#x27;s progressive faction. Instead, following the LCL&#x27;s return to power at the 1968 election, Millhouse was given the portfolios of Attorney-General, Aboriginal Affairs, Social Welfare, and Labour and Industry. In these roles, Millhouse gained a reputation as a crusader for progressive social change as he sought to position South Australia as a national leader on social issues. During 1969 Millhouse was the architect and the major proponent for abortion on health grounds in South Australia, a decision that he would come to regret decades later, when he claimed that it had become &quot;abortion on demand&quot;. In the wake of the LCL&#x27;s 1970 election loss, Millhouse was elected Deputy Leader of the Opposition on 2 June.

After the LCL also lost the 1973 state election, Millhouse resigned from the party on 18 March 1973 to form the Liberal Movement, along with former premier Steele Hall and a number of other senior LCL members, following growing dissatisfaction at the continuing conservatism of the LCL. He led the Liberal Movement at the 1975 state election, where the party received 18% of the vote, though only winning four seats.

In 1976, all Liberal Movement parliamentary members except for Millhouse returned to what by then had become the South Australia branch of the Liberal Party. Millhouse chose instead to form a new political party, the New LM, before it merged with the Australia Party, the Centre-Line Party and other like minded groups to form the Australian Democrats. As a sitting member, he became the first Australian Democrats Member of Parliament in 1977.

As a Democrat, Millhouse retained his seat of Mitcham at the 1977 and 1979 state elections. He continued to campaign for progressive social issues, including the introduction of a bill to legalise prostitution in South Australia.

==Judicial career==
===South Australia===
Millhouse was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1979. He resigned from parliament on 7 July 1982, sparking a by-election, upon accepting a position as a South Australian Supreme Court justice. He served on the Supreme Court until his retirement due to age in December 1999.

===Further judicial appointments===
At his retirement sitting, he announced his appointment as Chief Justice of the High Court of Kiribati, a position he held until January 2011. He was Chief Justice of Nauru from 3 April 2006 to late 2010.

Following his retirement as Chief Justice of Kiribati, he served as a judge of High Court of Tuvalu from February 2014 and March 2015.

==Personal life==
He married Ann (died 1992) in 1957 and had three daughters and two sons. Millhouse died on 28 April 2017, aged 87.

Sir Eric Millhouse (1891 – 24 February 1950), lawyer and champion of returned soldiers, was an uncle.

<text>The AIM-26 Falcon was a larger, more powerful version of the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile built by Hughes. It is the only guided American air-to-air missile with a nuclear warhead to be produced; the unguided AIR-2 Genie rocket was also nuclear-armed.

== Development ==
Starting in 1956 Hughes Electronics began the development of an enlarged version of the GAR-1D Falcon that would carry a nuclear warhead. It was intended to provide a sure kill in attacks on Soviet heavy bomber aircraft, at a time when guided missiles were not accurate enough to produce high-probability kills with small conventional warheads. The original development was for semi-active radar homing and heat-seeking versions based on the conventional GAR-1/GAR-2 weapons, under the designations GAR-5 and GAR-6, respectively. The original program was cancelled.
The program was revived in 1959, now under the name GAR-11. It entered service in 1961, carried by Air Defense Command F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors. It used a radar proximity fuze and semi-active radar homing. The GAR-11 used a sub-kiloton (250 ton) yield W54 warhead shared with the &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; M388 recoilless rifle projectile, rather than the larger W25 warhead of the AIR-2 Genie.

Out of concern for the problems inherent in using nuclear weapons over friendly territory, a conventional version, the GAR-11A, was developed, using a explosive warhead.

== Conventional warhead ==
As part of a wider Army/Navy/Air Force renaming project, in 1963 the weapon was redesignated AIM-26. The nuclear version became the AIM-26A, the conventional model the AIM-26B. From 1970 to 1972 the nuclear warheads of the AIM-26A weapons were rebuilt for the nuclear version of the AGM-62 Walleye TV guided bomb.

The AIM-26 saw little widespread use in American service, retiring in 1972. The conventional AIM-26B was exported to Switzerland as the HM-55, where it was used on Swiss Mirage IIIS fighters. The AIM-26B was produced under license (and modified) in Sweden as the Rb 27, arming Saab Draken J-35F and 35J fighters. It was retired in 1998. When Finland bought Drakens, the license-manufactured Swedish Falcons were included.

== Specifications (GAR-11/AIM-26A) ==
* Length: 
* Wingspan: 
* Diameter: 
* Weight: 
* Speed: Mach 2

<text>Andrew Jackson Hamilton (January 28, 1815 – April 11, 1875) was an American politician during the third quarter of the 19th century. He was a lawyer, state representative, military governor of Texas, as well as the 11th Governor of Texas during Reconstruction.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Huntsville, Alabama, on January 28, 1815. His education began in Alabama where he went to law school and was eventually admitted to the bar in Talladega, Alabama. In order to join his older brother Morgan, Hamilton moved to Texas late in 1846 and opened his own law practice in La Grange, Texas. Three years later he left the city, moving to Austin, Texas, to begin his political career.

==Political career==
In 1849 Hamilton was appointed as the acting state attorney general by Texas Governor Peter H. Bell.

In 1850 he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing Travis County as a Democrat. He would only serve one term, leaving office in 1853. During this time he joined the &quot;Opposition Clique&quot;, a faction of southern politicians in the Democratic Party who opposed secession and the reopening of the slave trade.

In 1858, Hamilton was elected to the United States House of Representatives as an Independent Democrat representing the western district of Texas. During this time he served on a House committee formed late in 1860 to solve the growing sectional feud between the North and South. He chose not to run for re-election in 1860, but, on his return to Texas in 1861, won a special election to the State Senate. Hamilton was later forced to resign this post after threats to his life for his pro-Union statements. He fled to Mexico in July 1862.

During the American Civil War, Hamilton sided with the Union. After fleeing to Mexico, he went on a tour of the Northeast, giving speeches in New York, Boston, and other northern cities. He spoke out in favor of the Union and criticized the &quot;slave power&quot; of the South. Because of this Hamilton was regarded as a hero by the North, though he was generally viewed as a traitor at home.

In late 1862 President Abraham Lincoln named Hamilton the Military Governor of Texas with the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. He spent the rest of the war holding this empty position in New Orleans after a Union attempt to capture South Texas failed in 1863.

==Governor of Texas==
On June 17, 1865, President Andrew Johnson named Hamilton as the provisional civilian governor of the state. Hamilton held office for 14 months during the early stages of Reconstruction. He was governor when the nation ratified the Thirteenth Amendment and granted economic freedom to the newly freed slaves, although Texas itself declined to ratify the amendment until 1870. Hamilton also faced problems such as Indian incursions, general lawlessness, and chaotic finances in the aftermath of the Civil War. When his plans at the Constitutional Convention of 1866 were not enacted, he rejected Johnson&#x27;s plan for Reconstruction and aligned himself with the Radical Republicans. He spoke out in favor of black suffrage and in September 1866 organized the Southern Loyalists&#x27; Convention in Philadelphia, where he criticized President Johnson. He resigned in 1867 and went to work as a bankruptcy judge in New Orleans. Later that year he accepted a position as a justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Hamilton tried to regain the governorship in the election of 1869 but was defeated by Edmund J. Davis.

==Post-governorship==
After leaving office, Hamilton switched to the regular Republican Party. He served on the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868–69 and on the Republican National Executive Committee. He reversed his views on black suffrage, withdrawing his support for it. After losing the Gubernatorial election in 1869, Hamilton served as the leader of Tax-Payers&#x27; Convention in 1871.

Andrew Jackson Hamilton died in Austin, Texas, on April 11, 1875, of tuberculosis. He is buried at Oakwood Cemetery.

<text>The Trans-Iranian Railway () was a major railway building project started in Pahlavi Iran in 1927 and completed in 1938, under the direction of the then-Iranian monarch Reza Shah. It was entirely built with indigenous capital, and links the capital Tehran with Bandar Shahpur (now: Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni) on the Persian Gulf in the south and Bandar Shah (now: Bandar Torkaman) on the Caspian Sea in the north, via Ahvaz and Ghom. In 1961, under Reza Shah&#x27;s son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, it was extended from Bandar Shah to a new terminus in Gorgan. During the land reforms of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1963, as part of the &quot;White Revolution&quot;, the Trans-Iranian railway was extended to link Tehran to Mashhad, Tabriz and Isfahan.

The original 1938 Bandar Shahpur-to-Bandar Shah route was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2021.

==Before World War I: the Russian scheme==
The idea of a railway connecting the Russian Empire and British India was proposed by several private Russian promoters in 1889, 1900, and 1905. However, the Russian government declined such proposals, fearing that it would jeopardize Russia&#x27;s geographically enabled commercial dominance in Iran as well as complicate relations with the British. In 1889, Russia and the Shah agreed that no railways would be built in Iran without the consent of the Russians. However, by 1910 the agreement was vetoed in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. Fears that Russian interests were no longer primary, alongside the surfacing of anti-Russian political forces in the country, and the emergence of a German threat, made it more important than ever for Iran to protect its commercial interests by building a railway.

To build the railway the problem of raising enough capital to fund the project was discussed. The Russo-Japanese War of 1905 was one of several factors leaving Russia on a tight budget, preventing Russia from providing funds. The British were solicited as well, but the request could not be granted, pushing back initiation of the railway&#x27;s construction further. Nikolay Khomyakov, President of the Duma, and I.A. Zveginstov, supporters of the Anglo-Russian Entente, promoted a private initiative for a railway connecting India and Europe, to counteract the economic threat Germany posed to the region. Germany&#x27;s influence over the region was enabled by the Baghdad Railway, which connected Germany and the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq), enabling Germany to begin plans for connecting the railway to Tehran to increase its commercial enterprise. Despite opposition from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance, there was also support for the project.

A Trans-Iranian Railway Consortium was formed by December 1910, consisting of twelve major Russian banks. Nine of these banks came to an agreement with major French banks in 1911, resulting in the crucial financial support needed to fund the railway. However, the final step needed to initiate the project was the support of the British, who wanted to restore financial stability in Iran but did not wish to be involved in the Trans-Iranian Railway Consortium through the proposed four to six million pound loan, proposed by Alexander Izvolsky, Imperial Foreign Minister 1906–10, and Sergey Sazonov, Foreign Minister 1910–16. Sazonov continued to urge for the loan, believing it to be the solution to prevent Persia from bankruptcy. Lord Curzon, British Viceroy of India, rejected the loan, suspicious that the Russians had an acquisitive eye on Britain&#x27;s precious Indian colony, provoking stark protest from Sazonov against the accusation. Finally, in 1912, the Russian, French, and British financiers formed a Société d&#x27;Etudes for the Trans-Iranian railway.

When Arthur von Gwinner, Chief Manager of Deutsche Bank and the Baghdad Railway, announced plans to build a section of the railway connecting Baghdad to Khanaqin by 1916, the Russians moved quickly to secure British support and French investments in the Société d&#x27;Etudes. The Russians were primarily concerned with the construction of the northern section of the line, extending from Astara to Tehran, while the British were more concerned with the southern section, since they already dominated the southern region and the Persian Gulf.

Meanwhile, the Balkan Wars in the Ottoman Empire (1912–13) created an unstable situation in the country, again putting off the initiation of the application. Such instability caused investors in the Société d&#x27;Etudes to hesitate in investing in a bankrupt Iran. Sazonov suggested that appointing a strong Iranian leader would aid the financial aspect of the railway project. Sa&#x27;d Dawla, former minister under former Muhammad Ali Shah, agreed to work with the two powers to use a grant from the Société d&#x27;Etudes and thus proceed with the construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway without the agreement of the newly formed parliament. However, Sir Edward Grey, Britain&#x27;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, refused to force the Iranians to accept Sa&#x27;d Dawla as Prime Minister, because of his aversion to the Constitutional movement in Iran.

The outcome of the Balkan Wars caused Russian and Britain to accept the probability of war with the Central Powers in the near future, suggesting the necessity of strong Anglo-Russian relations. Sazonov grew frustrated with Britain&#x27;s inability to compromise on a route incorporating India, and threatened to proceed with the northern route. Fearing the implications of the impending war, Grey at last found it in Britain&#x27;s best interest to concede at last, and agreed to initiate application of the railway under the Balmoral conditions. By this time Britain already had further consolidated its control over the Persian Gulf.

By June 1914 surveys for the Enzeli-Tehran section had begun, and by 1915 the results of the Astara-Tehran part of the railway were completed and published. Still, progress on the railway was slow. Then, a few days after the outbreak of World War I, Russia repudiated its obligation to build the Tehran-Khanaqin line under the Potsdam Agreement.

==After World War I==
After the substantial interruption of World War I, the project for constructing a standard-gauge railway across Iran was initiated by Reza Shah Pahlavi as part of numerous reforms contributing to the drastic modernization of Iran that occurred over the two decades between World War I and World War II. Although technically independent, Iran was still a financially devastated and weak country. Yet the decade of the thirties brought the emergence of an economic market, a drastic increase in modern industries, a rise in exports, and an increase in agricultural output.

Initially, British and Russian observers considered the implantation of railways as the ultimate solution to the immense transportation problems Iran faced due to sparsely settled population, the lack of rivers, high mountains, and inhospitable desert regions of the country. Many Americans and British opposed the Trans-Iranian Railway, suggesting more efficient and less expensive modes of transportation, such as the U.S. Army&#x27;s Motor Transport Service, which hauled about a fourth of the volume hauled by the railway to the Soviet border. Some British critics, including General Percy Sykes, opposed the railway because it ran north to south, rather than from west to east. The west to east route was preferred because it would allow the British direct access to their military bases in India and Mesopotamia, and at the same time, avoiding the threat of commercial loss of profit to Russia and any foreign rival.

There were also Iranians opposed to the building of the railway as well, believing that the money could instead be much more effectively used on roads. However, if a cabinet minister was caught criticizing the extensive tax burden the railway produced, he could be placed in prison on counts of being a British collaborator, decidedly attempting to keep Iran backwards for his own financial and strategic goals.

While it may seem logical to attribute the reduction in transportation prices to the Trans-Iranian Railway, in reality it contributed minimally. Although much opposition to the railway was politically and financially motivated, the railway was an expensive tax-burden, costing Iran 2,195,180,700 rials through 1938-1939. The majority of capital used to fund the railway was provided through taxes on goods such as sugar and tea, produced in plants set up by the industries ministry, as part of Reza Shah Pahlavi&#x27;s reform movement.

===Construction===
In 1924 the American company Ulen negotiated with Prime minister Reza Khan (the later Reza Shah) an agreement to do a feasibility study for a railway line Khorramshahr and the Caspian Sea.

In the following years Reza who became Shah in 1925 had legislation passed in parliament which secured internal Iranian funding for the railway project from taxes levied on consumption of sugar and other goods thus excluding a new round of external debts that had bogged down the rulers of Iran before World War I.

In further negotiations it was agreed first to construct 2 test lines starting from the northern and the southern end of the projected Transiranian Railroad in order to establish cost for an agreement on the whole line. Against competing interests from other countries the Americans decided to form a joint venture with German companies.

From 1927 an international syndicate called &quot;Syndicat du Chemin du Fer en Perse&quot; consisting of the American Ulen and Company and a German &quot;Konsortium für Bauausführungen in Persien&quot; (formed by 3 German companies Philipp Holzmann, Julius Berger and Siemens Bauunion) undertook the construction of the initial test lines. The Americans brought the line from Bandar Shahpur via Ahvaz up to Dezful. The German group started from the new harbour of Bandar Shah on the Caspian coast to the foothills of the Alborz mountains at Shahi (Qaem Shahr). The Americans terminated their contract in 1930 after delayed payments by the government resulting from a conflict with Reza Shah.

In April 1933 Iran concluded a contract with the Danish firm Kampsax. Kampsax at that time was active in railway construction in Turkey and the Shah followed the Turkish recommendation which had the additional advantage of bringing in a company from a small country which posed no political risk for Iranian independence. Kampsax subcontracted the project in 43 lots to companies from Europe, the USA and Iran. Kampsax engineers supervised the works on each lot, the works being coordinated from the head office in Tehran. The contract required Kampsax to complete the line by May 1939. Kampsax completed the project under-budget and ahead of schedule, with it being formally opened throughout on 26 August 1938.

The first official steam locomotive conductor to ride the line was an Iranian named Hossein Orang.
The first lines passed through formidable mountains. Long stretches have gradients of up to 1 in 36 and hillclimbing techniques such as railway spirals. The Three Golden Lines (&quot;Se Khat Tala&quot;) spiral is on the Mazandaran branch in the Sewatcow (Savadkuh) County of Mazanderan just a few kilometers south of Veresk Bridge. The line ascends or descends in a short distance by passing three times in the same area at different heights. Trains descend towards Sari or ascend in the opposite direction by going through the Dowgal twin tunnels. The line is 1,394 km long, has about 230 tunnels and 4100 bridges and its highest point is at Arak, 2,220 m above sea level. However, Kampsax&#x27; contractors laid relatively lightweight rails, ranging from 67 to 75 lbs per yard, that restricted the axle loads that the line could carry.

===Engineering and geological challenges===
Various geological problems were encountered, requiring abandonment of some tunnels and realignment of the route through different terrain:
* A tunnel through a salt dome was abandoned because the disrupted water table would erode away the salt.
* A tunnel started through apparently solid rock was abandoned after it encountered powdery gypsum that filled the excavation as quickly as it was dug out.
* A tunnel through pumice could not be blasted and could not be dug as the picks and shovels became stuck.
* A tunnel encountered a large &quot;void&quot; or cavern in the mountain that required a bridge within the tunnel.
* Poor fresh water supplies made mixing of long-lasting mortar and concrete problematic.
* Large bridges such as the Veresk Bridge were necessary to cross the Alborz mountains.

===Locomotives===
In 1936 Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company supplied Iran with four Garratt articulated locomotives (works numbers 6787–6890). In 1938 these became class 86.01. Until the British invasion of Iran in 1941 (see below, Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran) these Garratts seem to have been the only standard gauge British locomotives in Iran.

German manufacturers supplied 65 steam locomotives for the opening of the line in 1938. 49 were 2-8-0 Consolidations: 24 from Krupp forming class 41.11, 16 from Henschel &amp; Son forming class 41.35 and nine from Maschinenfabrik Esslingen forming class 41.51. The other 16 were Henschel 2-10-0 Decapods forming class 51.01.

The Trans-Iranian acquired 10 of the locomotives that Kampsax had used to build the line. These were Gölsdorf two-cylinder compound 0-10-0 freight locomotives built between 1909 and 1915 as Austrian State Railways class 80 by Wiener Neustädter Lokomotivfabrik, Lokomotivfabrik Floridsdorf and Lokomotivfabrik der StEG in Vienna and by Breitfeld-Daněk in Bohemia. When the Iranian railway introduced its new numbering system in 1938 the Gölsdorf 0-10-0s kept their original Austrian numbers.

==World War II==

===British and Soviet operation 1941–42===

The British and Russians initially stated their reason for invading Iran was the Iranian government&#x27;s failure to rid the country of Germans, who supposedly were planning an eventual coup d&#x27;etat. Yet there were other reasons for the invasion, and the Trans-Iranian Railways key location as part of the so-called &quot;Persian Corridor&quot; was one of the primary reasons for the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in World War II. Despite Reza Shah&#x27;s attempts to remain neutral, the allies decided it would be most effective to remove Reza Shah from the throne, using his young son, instead to assist in their use of the Trans-Iranian Railway to transport oil to Britain, and supplies to the Soviet Union.

In August 1941 Soviet, British and British Indian forces invaded Iran to protect their oil supply in Iran and to secure the Persian Corridor supply route from the Persian Gulf to the Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union. In September 1941 the Allies took over operation of the Trans-Iranian Railway: British and Empire Royal Engineers (RE) commanded by Brigadier Godfrey D. Rhodes operating the Southern Division between Tehran and the port of Bandar Shahpur on the Persian Gulf and the Soviet Army operating the Northern Division between Tehran and the port of Bandar Shah on the Caspian Sea.

The RE expanded freight capacity by building new railway yards at Bandar Shahpur, Ahvaz and Andimeshk and a junction at Ahvaz for a new line to Khorramshahr on the Shatt al-Arab. In order to increase the line&#x27;s locomotive fleet the RE built a yard at Abadan to transfer locomotives from merchant ships to barges to take them up the River Karun and a derrick on a jetty on the Karun at Ahwaz to unload them from the barges onto the railway. When the British first took over the southern part in 1941, the railway was only able to move one freight train per day. The railroad hauled a total volume of 978 tons a day in the first quarter of 1942. Yet by September 1943, they were able to move 5,400 tons per day, due to the import of new locomotives, wagons, and more skilled individuals.

===Locomotives===
The Southern Division locomotive depot at Ahvaz had two German 2-10-0s, seven German 2-8-0s, two class 41.01 2-8-0s built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1934, two class 80.14 0-10-0s from an Austrian locomotive builder and seven smaller locomotives. The RE found that all except the 2-10-0s were in poor condition, as was some of the freight rolling stock. In December dozens of LMS 2-8-0 steam locomotives and 840 20 ton freight wagons started to arrive from Britain. 27 coal-burning LMS 2-8-0s, designated class 41.100 in the Iranian State Railways numbering system, were in service by February 1942. Once enough LMS 2-8-0s were in service some of the German locomotives were released to increase the fleet on the Northern Division that the Soviets were operating. From February until August 1942 96 oil-burning LMS 2-8-0s, designated class 41.150, entered service on the Southern Division and by December 1942 another 19 class 41.100 coal-burners had joined them. In the same year Davenport Locomotive Works supplied 24 diesel-mechanical 0-4-0 switchers, designated class 20.01, that Iran had ordered before the Allied invasion.

===US and Soviet operation 1942–45===
In December 1942 the US Army Transportation Corps (USATC) replaced the British and Empire force operating the Southern Division. In 165 miles (266 km) the line has 144 tunnels, in which smoke and oil fumes created harsh working conditions for steam locomotive crews. A limited water supply throughout the route and the hot climate of the southern plains formed further difficulties for steam locomotive operation. The USATC therefore considered diesel-electric locomotives more suitable and requisitioned the 13 ALCO RS-1s built and had them converted to ALCO RSD-1 1,000 horsepower Co-Co locomotives. An additional 44 RSD-1s were built for use in Iran. These totalled only 57 locomotives so initially they were used to operate only the southern part of the Southern Division between Bandar Shahpur and Andimeshk.

For traffic between Andimeshk and Tehran the USATC brought 91 S200 Class steam locomotives, designated class 42.400 in the Iranian State Railways numbering system. The USATC also introduced another 3,000 freight cars. In April 1943 another 18 ALCO RSD-1&#x27;s entered service, enabling the USATC to return some LMS 2-8-0s to the British Middle East Command and extend diesel operation northwards, reaching Qom by September 1943 and regularly serving Tehran by May 1944. The USATC further increased freight traffic so that in 1944 it averaged 6,489 tons per day.

&quot;Aid to Russia&quot; traffic ceased by May 1945 and in June the USATC withdrew its RSD-1&#x27;s and returned control to the British authorities. Shortly afterwards the British restored the line to Iranian State Railways, the predecessor to the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways.

==After World War II==
The railway was extended from Bandar Shah to Gorgan in 1961.

In 2014, the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran railway link, part of the International North–South Transport Corridor, was completed and made operational, connecting Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan with Iran, with a new line connecting Gorgan to Etrek in Turkmenistan. The railways of former states of the Soviet Union use a Russian gauge, requiring the Iranian Railways to provide break-of-gauge services at the border with Turkmenistan.

<text>In phycology, a pneumatocyst is a floating structure that contains gas found on brown seaweed. A seaweed&#x27;s thallus may have more than one. They provide buoyancy to lift the blades toward the surface, allowing them to receive more sunlight for photosynthesis.

The proportion of gases in the pneumatocysts varies depending on the physiological status of the alga and the partial pressure of gases in the surrounding air or water. The pneumatocyst can hold O2, CO2, N2, and CO.

<doc id="1193458" wikidata="Q645857" url="?curid=1193458" title="Niall of the Nine Hostages">
<text>Niall Noígíallach (; Old Irish &quot;having nine hostages&quot;), or Niall of the Nine Hostages, was a legendary, semi-historical Irish king who was the ancestor of the Uí Néill dynasties that dominated Ireland from the 6th to the 10th centuries. Historical Irish annalistic and chronicle sources place his reign in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, although modern scholars date him about half a century later.

==Historicity and dates==
Niall is presumed, based on the importance of his sons and grandsons, to have been a historical person, but the early Irish annals say little about him. The &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot; date his death before 382, and the &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot; to 411. The later &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; dates his reign to 379–405, and the chronology of Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; to 368–395.

However, the early annals record the activities of his sons between 429 and 516, an implausibly long period for a single generation, leading scholars like Kathleen Hughes and Francis J. Byrne to conclude that the events of the later half of the 5th century have been extended backwards to accommodate as early a date as possible for the arrival of Saint Patrick, with the effect of pushing Niall back up to half a century. Hughes says &quot;Niall himself must have died not before the middle of the fifth century&quot;. Byrne, following James Carney, is a little more precise, dating his death to c. 452.

Niall is placed in the traditional list of High Kings of Ireland. However, the traditional roll of kings and its chronology is now recognised as artificial. The High Kingship did not become a reality until the 9th century, and Niall&#x27;s status has probably been inflated in line with the political importance of the dynasty he founded.

T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly argues that Niall and his sons were responsible for the breakup of the ancient kingdom of Ulster and the creation of the kingdoms of Tír Chonaill and Tír Eoghain, and the satellite kingdom of the Airgíalla. O&#x27;Rahilly and Byrne argue that the literary sources, though late and garbled, preserve genuine traditions that Niall led raids on Britain, and perhaps died on one.

Professor Dáithí Ó hÓgáin seems to indicate that Niall was probably a descendant of the Gaulish seafaring tribe of the Veneti, who originated in south-east Armorica (modern Brittany, France). Some of these sailors probably migrated to Cornwall, and later to south-eastern Ireland where they became known as the Venii and grew in power. They worshipped a ram god and sometimes called themselves Ghaisonli (&#x27;spear-men&#x27;), possibly to compete in propaganda with the Lagini (&#x27;lance-men&#x27;).

The southern Venii came to be known as the Eoghanacht, while another group of them migrated north and formed a new kingdom west of the River Shannon where they became known as the Connachta after a revered leader named Conn. These Connachta later extended their power eastward into the plain of Meath, and under the leader Teutovalos Teachtmhar overthrew the kingship of the Lagini at Tara around AD 300. As the Celtic language in Ireland transformed into Irish between AD 400–500, Venii became Féni, and were also known to have called themselves Gaídhil (from Common Celtic *wēdelos, Brythonic gwddel, Goidelic *wēdus to Old Irish Goídel—meaning savage woodsman, wild, raider). The Primitive Irish Vendo is a cognate with Finn, and the Fianna were landless, aristocratic young men and women who had not yet come into their inheritance of land. Niall, the son of Ivocatus Magumedonus (&#x27;Eochaidh the Slave-ruler&#x27;), came to lead the Connachta in the fifth century AD.

==Legendary biography==
A biography of Niall can be constructed from sources such as the &quot;Roll of Kings&quot; section of the 11th-century &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, compiled in the 17th-century, chronicles such as Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; (1634), and legendary tales like the 11th-century &quot;The Adventure of the Sons of Eochaid Mugmedon&quot; and &quot;The Death of Niall of the Nine Hostages&quot;. These sources date from long after Niall&#x27;s time and they have little to no value as history.

===Early life===
A legendary account of Niall&#x27;s birth and early life is given in the possibly 11th-century tale &quot;Echtra mac nEchach Muimedóin&quot; (&quot;The adventure of the sons of Eochaid Mugmedón&quot;). In it, Eochaid Mugmedón, the High King of Ireland, had five sons: four, Brión, Ailill, Fiachrae and Fergus, by his first wife Mongfind, sister of the king of Munster, Crimthann mac Fidaig; and a fifth, Niall, by his second wife Cairenn Chasdub, daughter of Sachell Balb, king of the Saxons. While Cairenn is pregnant with Niall, the jealous Mongfind forces her to do heavy work, hoping to make her miscarry. She gives birth as she is drawing water, but out of fear of Mongfind, she leaves the child on the ground, exposed to the birds. The baby is rescued and brought up by a poet called Torna. When Niall grows up he returns to Tara and rescues his mother from her labour.

Although it is anachronistic for Niall&#x27;s mother to have been a Saxon, O&#x27;Rahilly argues that the name &quot;Cairenn&quot; is derived from the Latin name Carina, and that it is plausible that she might have been a Romano-Briton. Keating describes her not as a Saxon but as the &quot;daughter of the king of Britain&quot;. Mongfind appears to have been a supernatural personage: the saga &quot;The Death of Crimthann mac Fidaig&quot; says the festival of Samhain was commonly called the &quot;Festival of Mongfind&quot;, and prayers were offered to her on Samhain eve.

===Accession===
Seeing Niall&#x27;s popularity among the nobles, Mongfind demands that Eochaid name a successor, hoping it will be one of her sons. Eochaid gives the task to a druid, Sithchenn, who devises a contest between the brothers, shutting them in a burning forge, telling them to save what they can, and judging them based on which objects they choose to save. Niall, who emerges carrying an anvil, is deemed greater than Brión, with a sledgehammer, Fiachrae with bellows and a pail of beer, Ailill with a chest of weapons, and Fergus with a bundle of wood. Mongfind refuses to accept the decision.

Sithchenn takes the brothers to the smith, who makes them weapons, and sends them out hunting. Each brother, in turn, goes looking for water, and finds a well guarded by a hideous hag who demands a kiss in return for water. Fergus and Ailill refuse and return empty-handed. Fiachrae gives her a quick peck, but not enough to satisfy her. Only Niall kisses her properly, and she is revealed as a beautiful maiden, the Sovereignty of Ireland. She grants Niall not only water but the kingship for many generations—twenty-six of his descendants will be High Kings of Ireland. Fiachrae is granted a minor royal line—two of his descendants, Nath Í and Ailill Molt, will be High Kings.

This &quot;loathly lady&quot; motif appears in myth and folklore throughout the world. Variations of this story are told of the earlier Irish high king Lugaid Loígde, in Arthurian legend—one of the most famous versions appears in both Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale and the related Gawain romance, &quot;The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle&quot;—and in John Gower&#x27;s Middle English poem &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;.

In another story, the succession is not settled when Eochaid dies, and Mongfind&#x27;s brother Crimthann takes the high kingship. But while he is away on a tour of his lands in Scotland, Mongfind&#x27;s sons seize Ireland. Crimthann returns to Ireland intending to give battle. Mongfind, purporting to make peace between her brother and her sons, holds a feast, at which she serves Crimthann a poisoned drink. Crimthann refuses to drink it unless she does too; they both drink, and both die. Niall succeeds to the High Kingship, and Brión becomes his second in command. Another version has Mongfind try to poison Niall, but she takes the poison herself by mistake.

While Niall is the high king, his brothers establish themselves as local kings. Brión rules the province of Connacht, but Fiachrae makes war against him. Brión defeats Fiachrae and hands him over as a prisoner to Niall, but Fiachrae&#x27;s son Nath Í continues the war and eventually kills Brión. Niall releases Fiachrae, who becomes king of Connacht and Niall&#x27;s right-hand man. Fiachrae and Ailill then make war against Crimthann&#x27;s son Eochaid, king of Munster. They defeat him and win great spoils, but Fiachrae is wounded in the battle and dies of his wounds shortly afterwards. The Munstermen renew the battle, capture Ailill and cut him to pieces, and war continues between Munster and Connacht for many years.

===Death===
The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; says there was war between Niall and Énnae Cennsalach, king of Leinster, over the &quot;bórama&quot; or cow-tribute first imposed on Leinster by Tuathal Techtmar. Énna&#x27;s son Eochaid is named as Niall&#x27;s killer in all sources, although the circumstances vary. All sources agree he died outside Ireland. The earliest version of the &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; says Eochaid killed him on the English Channel, later versions add that Niall was invading Brittany when this happened. Keating, quoting a Latin Life of Saint Patrick, says that Niall led Irish raids on Roman Britain, and in one of those raids Patrick and his sisters were abducted. Keating associates these raids with those mentioned by Gildas and Bede, and deduces that, since some Irish sources say Patrick was abducted from Brittany, that Niall&#x27;s raids must have extended to continental Europe as well.

In the saga &quot;The Death of Niall of the Nine Hostages&quot;, Eochaid&#x27;s enmity with Niall begins when he is refused hospitality by Niall&#x27;s poet, Laidcenn mac Bairchid. He makes war and destroys the poet&#x27;s stronghold, killing his son Leat (Keating has it that Laidchenn was a druid, and that Eochaid killed his son after he used defamatory language towards him). Laidchenn responds by satirising Leinster so that no corn, grass or leaves grow there for a year. Then Niall makes war against Leinster, and peace is concluded on the condition that Eochaid is handed over. Niall chains Eochaid to a standing stone, and sends nine warriors to execute him, but Eochaid breaks his chain and kills all nine of them with it. He then kills Laidchenn by throwing a stone which lodges in his forehead. Niall exiles him to Scotland. The story then becomes confusing. Niall makes war in Europe as far as the Alps, and the Romans send an ambassador to parlay with him. Abruptly, the tale then has Niall appearing before an assembly of Pictish bards in Scotland, where he is killed by an arrow shot by Eochaid from the other side of the valley. Keating has Eochaid shoot Niall from the opposite bank of the river Loire during his European campaign. His men carry his body home, fighting seven battles on the way, and his foster-father Torna dies of grief. His body is said to have been buried at Ochann, now known as Faughan Hill at Jordanstown, a few miles west of Navan in County Meath. He is succeeded by his nephew Nath Í.

Byrne suggests that Niall&#x27;s death took place during a raid on Roman Britain. Irish tradition had forgotten that the Romans once ruled Britain, and relocated his remembered confrontations with the Empire to continental Europe, with &quot;Alba&quot;, the ancient name for Britain, being confused with &quot;Elpa&quot;, the Alps, or being understood with its later meaning of Scotland. A poem by the 11th-century poet Cináed Ua hArtacáin in the Book of Leinster credits Niall with seven raids on Britain, on the last of which he was killed by Eochaid &quot;above the surf of the Ictian Sea&quot;; a poem attributed to the same poet in &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; credits him with going to the Alps seven times.

===Family and descendants===
Keating credits Niall with two wives: Inne, daughter of Lugaid, who bore him one son, Fiachu; and Rignach, who bore him seven sons, Lóegaire, Éndae, Maine, Eógan, Conall Gulban, Conall Cremthainne and Coirpre. These sons are the eponymous ancestors of the various Uí Néill dynasties: Eógan of the Cenél nEógain and Conall Gulban of the Cenél Conaill, making up the northern Uí Néill; Fiachu of the Cenél Fiachach dynasty, Lóegaire (the king who Saint Patrick is said to have converted) of the Cenél Lóegaire, Maine of the Uí Maine, Conall Cremthainne of the Clann Cholmáin and the Síl nÁedo Sláine, and Coirpre of the Cenél Coirpri, making up the southern Uí Néill. The O&#x27;Higgins family claims descent from the Southern branch of Uí Néill. Famous descendants include Niall&#x27;s great-great-grandson Saint Columba, Saint Máel Ruba, the Kings of Ailech, the Kings of Tir Eogain, and the Kings of Tír Conaill. The Scottish Clan Ewen of Otter, Gilchrist; Clan Lamont; the MacSorleys of Monydrain, (of Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg a branch of Clan Donald); Clan Maclachlan; Clan MacNeil, and the MacSweens all claim descent from an Irish prince of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty, Ánrothán Ua Néill/Anrothan O&#x27;Neill, son of Áed, son of Flaithbertach Ua Néill, King of Ailech and Cenél nEógain, who left Ireland for Kintyre in the 11th century and died 1036.

As next-generation sequencing has become available, various chief lines have been tested. Although these studies are not coordinated with each other and are ongoing, it is already apparent that not all of these lineages are related to each other within Niall&#x27;s timeframe. For instance, the chiefs of Clan Donald are now known to belong to a branch of Haplogroup R1a, which split from Niall&#x27;s hypothetical lineage over 20,000 years ago.

====Y Chromosome Analysis====
Following a 2006 hypothesis by Moore et al. suggesting that his Y chromosomal signature had been discovered, popular science journalists and genetic testing companies began promoting the theory that millions alive today have an unbroken descent from Niall.

Geneticists at Trinity College Dublin found that 21 per cent of men from north-western Ireland, 8 per cent from all of Ireland, a substantial percentage of men from western and central Scotland, and about 2 per cent of men from New York bore the same Y-chromosome haplotype. The geneticists estimated that about 2–3 million men bear this haplotype. Moore et al. concluded that these men descend from &quot;a single early-medieval progenitor&quot; and implied this was associated with Niall&#x27;s dynasty. While Moore et al. did not specifically state that Niall was the progenitor of M222, journalists quickly jumped to that conclusion. According to the PBS documentary series &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Stephen Colbert, Colin Quinn, Bill Maher, and the show&#x27;s host, Henry Louis Gates Jr. all display STR markers consistent with the Irish Modal Haplotype. The series suggested that Niall may have been the most fecund male in Irish history.

This suggestion is no longer plausible. Niall does not have verifiable remains that can be tested. Furthermore, the paper examined only 17 STR loci, which are not a reliable means of verifying descent, as SNPs, which define haplogroups and subclades, would be. Indeed, more recent estimates indicate that the R1b-M222 subclade marked by the Moore et al. haplotype probably originated in the 2nd millennium BC, long before Niall is claimed to have lived, so his descendants would only represent a minority of men in this group even if Niall had been a historical figure.

Perhaps even more problematic is the dearth of M222 lineages in Midlands samples. We would expect to find a large concentration of Niall&#x27;s descendants there, as the Southern Uí Néill were dominant in that region, but we do not. Because of that, the identification of M222 with Niall&#x27;s descendants is &quot;difficult to justify&quot;.

===Origin of his epithet===

There are various versions of how Niall gained his epithet &quot;Noígíallach&quot;. The saga &quot;The Death of Niall of the Nine Hostages&quot; says that he received five hostages from the five provinces of Ireland (Ulster, Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Meath), and one each from Scotland, the Saxons, the Britons and the Franks. Keating says that he received five from the five provinces of Ireland, and four from Scotland. O&#x27;Rahilly suggests that the nine hostages were from the kingdom of the Airgialla (literally &quot;hostage-givers&quot;), a satellite state founded by the Ui Néill&#x27;s conquests in Ulster, noting that the early Irish legal text &quot;Lebor na gCeart&quot; (&quot;The Book of Rights&quot;) says that the only duty of the Airgialla to the King of Ireland was to give him nine hostages.

<doc id="1193460" wikidata="Q17132684" url="?curid=1193460" title="Subsonic ammunition">
<text>Subsonic ammunition is ammunition designed to operate at velocities below the speed of sound (Mach 1), which at standard conditions is . This avoids the supersonic shockwave or &quot;crack&quot; of a supersonic bullet, which, particularly for suppressed firearms, influences the loudness of the shot.

Subsonic ammunition usually uses heavier bullets to retain as much kinetic energy as possible at the lower velocities. Some subsonic ammunition is used in non-suppressed firearms to gain the advantages of heavier bullet weights.

==Standard calibers==
===Subsonic versions of standard rounds===
In this instance, heavier bullets are loaded in standard ammunition, which reduces muzzle velocity below the speed of sound.

As an example, the very common 9×19mm Parabellum standard military round is a bullet at velocities typically around . Subsonic loads for 9×19mm Parabellum commonly use bullets at velocities of .

For these ammunition loads, balancing bullet weight and velocity are required to ensure that the ammunition will still reliably cycle semi-automatic firearms. Subsonic ammunition with normal bullet weights often fails to function properly in such firearms.

===Inherently subsonic calibers===
Some ammunition types were inherently designed with heavier, slower standard bullet weights and velocities. For example, the traditional American military standard .45 ACP ammunition load of a bullet at , is naturally subsonic.

==Specialized subsonic calibers==
Alternatively, specialized firearms and ammunition may be used to optimize total subsonic ammunition effectiveness. These are designed from the start as dedicated subsonic projectile systems. Some examples include .300 Whisper, 300 AAC Blackout, .338 Whisper, 8.6mm Blackout, 9×39mm, 12.7×55mm STs-130, .500 Whisper, and .510 Whisper.

==Use with suppressors==

Combined with firearm sound suppressors, subsonic ammunition may significantly reduce sound levels compared to normal ammunition. Specific reductions depend on the ammunition and suppressor.

The peak sound pressure levels of a Remington 700 .223 caliber bolt-action rifle firing high-velocity (supersonic) ammunition using a GEMTECH G5-5.56 suppressor.
The peak sound pressure levels of a Remington 700 .223 caliber bolt-action rifle firing low-velocity (subsonic) ammunition using a GEMTECH G5-5.56 suppressor.
Compared to the high-velocity (supersonic) unsuppressed condition, the combination of subsonic low-velocity ammunition and a firearm suppressor provided reductions of 45, 38, 40, and 48 dB, peak sound pressure level at the muzzle, left, right ears and behind the shooter, respectively.

<doc id="1193476" wikidata="Q1991889" url="?curid=1193476" title="Ron Rivera">
<text>Ronald Eugene Rivera (born January 7, 1962) is an American professional football coach who is an administrator for the California Golden Bears football team. He played nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a linebacker for the Chicago Bears and was a member of their 1985 team that won Super Bowl XX. He became a head coach and was twice named the NFL Coach of the Year with the Carolina Panthers.

Rivera played college football for the California Golden Bears, earning consensus All-American honors in 1983. He was selected by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft. His coaching career began in 1997 when he served as a quality control coach for the Bears. Rivera joined the Philadelphia Eagles as a linebackers coach two years later before rejoining the Bears as their defensive coordinator in 2004. The following year, he was named Assistant Coach of the Year by the PFWA and helped coach linebacker Brian Urlacher into being named Defensive Player of the Year. In 2006, the Bears made an appearance in Super Bowl XLI. In 2007, he joined the San Diego Chargers coaching linebackers before being promoted to defensive coordinator a year later.

After three years with the Chargers, Rivera was hired as head coach for Carolina. He led the Panthers to an appearance in Super Bowl 50 and became their all-time leader in wins. Rivera was fired near the end of the 2019 season due to new owner David Tepper wanting change and became Washington&#x27;s head coach in 2020. He was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma that same year but was considered cancer free by early 2021. Rivera is the only coach in NFL history to have led a team with a losing record to the playoffs more than once, doing so with Carolina in 2014 and Washington in 2020. He was fired by Washington after the 2023 season and worked as an analyst for &quot;ESPN&quot; before re-joining the Golden Bears in an administrative role in 2025.

==Early life==
Rivera was born in Fort Ord, California on January 7, 1962. His father, Eugenio Rivera, was a Puerto Rican commissioned officer in the US Army stationed in California. There, Eugenio met his future wife, Dolores, who is of Mexican and Filipino descent. The family moved often due to Eugenio&#x27;s military service, with Rivera being educated on bases in Germany, Panama, and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q/A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The family eventually settled in Marina, California, where he played football at Seaside High School before graduating in 1980.

==Playing career==
===College===
Rivera was granted a football scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley, where he led the Golden Bears in tackles as a linebacker during his three years there. For his final season in 1983, Rivera received several awards and honors for his performance, including being named a consensus All-American, Pac-10 Football Defensive Player of the Year along with Arizona linebacker Ricky Hunley, the Pop Warner Trophy, and being named MVP of the East–West Shrine Game.

===Professional===
Rivera was selected in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, playing for them as a rotational linebacker and special teamer. In 1985, Rivera became the first American of Puerto Rican descent to win a Super Bowl, as the Bears defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. He was named the team&#x27;s Man of the Year in 1988 and was named their Ed Block Courage Award recipient the following year.

Rivera played in nine seasons before retiring after the 1992 season, playing in 137 games with 62 starts, 392 tackles, 7.5 sacks, five forced fumbles, six fumble recoveries, and nine interceptions.

==Coaching career==
In 1993, Rivera went to work for WGN-TV and SportsChannel Chicago as a television analyst covering the Bears and college football. In 1997, he joined the Bears as a defensive quality control coach.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
In 1999, Rivera was named linebackers coach for the Philadelphia Eagles under newly hired head coach Andy Reid. During his tenure, the Eagles advanced to the NFC championship for three consecutive seasons. Rivera also was credited with developing linebacker Jeremiah Trotter into a two-time All-Pro.

===Chicago Bears===
Rivera was named defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears on January 23, 2004. In 2005, the Bears defense was rated second in the league by total yardage, with the team winning the NFC North division with a record of 11–5 before losing in the divisional round of the playoffs to the Carolina Panthers. For his efforts that year, Rivera was named Assistant Coach of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association. In 2006, the Bears had the league&#x27;s third-ranked defense in terms of points allowed, which helped them advance to Super Bowl XLI. Although the Bears lost to the Indianapolis Colts 29–17, the defense&#x27;s success earned Rivera recognition among franchises looking for new head coaches. In February 2007, it was announced that Rivera&#x27;s contract with the Bears would not be extended due to failed negotiations. Around the same time, he interviewed for several vacant head coaching positions around the league, including with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys.

===San Diego Chargers===
Rivera was hired by the San Diego Chargers to become their inside linebackers coach in February 2007 and was promoted to defensive coordinator after the team fired Ted Cottrell in October 2008.

===Carolina Panthers===

On January 11, 2011, Rivera was hired to become the fourth head coach of the Carolina Panthers. He was the third Latino in NFL history to become a head coach, following Tom Fears and Tom Flores. During his first year, the Panthers went 6–10 and finished third in the division.

In 2012, the Panthers finished 7–9 and finished second in the division. During his first two years with the Panthers, Rivera was known for his conservative decision-making, with journalists noting his record of 2–14 record in games decided by less than a touchdown.

Following a 1–3 start to the 2013 season, reports suggested that the Panthers were already contemplating getting a new head coach. As a result, Rivera began making more aggressive decisions. The Panthers then went 11–1 to finish the season, including a then-franchise record eight-game winning streak, to win the NFC South division and make the playoffs for the first time since 2008. For his efforts, Rivera was honored as the 2013 AP NFL Coach of the Year. During the early part of the 2013 season, Rivera was given the nickname of &quot;Riverboat Ron&quot; by fans and the media after taking several risky decisions, something previously not attributed to him. The name was inspired after 19th century frontier gamblers, with Rivera later embracing it for use on his social media profiles. Rivera was also known as &quot;Chico&quot; during his playing time with the Chicago Bears, a common practice that the team had under head coach Mike Ditka. Rivera received the nickname from defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, who reminded him of actor Freddie Prinze from the television series &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;.

In 2014, the Panthers recovered from a 3–8–1 start to win its final four regular-season games and clinch the NFC South for the second consecutive year. They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27–16 in the Wild Card Round for the team&#x27;s first playoff win since 2005 before falling to the eventual NFC champion Seattle Seahawks on the road 31–17 the following week.

The team&#x27;s momentum would continue in 2015, as the Panthers produced their best season in franchise history by finishing 15–1, with their only loss being against the Atlanta Falcons on the road in Week 16. Rivera was recognized as the 2015 AP NFL Coach of the Year, his second such honor. The team held the top seed in the NFC playoffs, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 31–24 in the Divisional Round and the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 during the NFC Championship Game, advancing to Super Bowl 50 against the Denver Broncos. It was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches, Rivera and the Broncos&#x27; Gary Kubiak, had previously played in a Super Bowl. The Panthers lost by a score of 24–10, in a game which both sides&#x27; defenses dominated.

The Panthers struggled in 2016, finishing 6–10 and did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time in four seasons.

The Panthers improved in 2017 and finished with an 11–5 record, entering the playoffs, but they lost in the Wild Card Round 31–26 to the New Orleans Saints.

Rivera signed a two-year contract extension worth 15.5 million in January 2018. The Panthers finished 7–9 in the 2018 season and missed the playoffs despite starting with a 6–2 record.

After a 5–7 start to the 2019 season, Rivera was fired on December 3, 2019, after nine seasons as head coach. Owner David Tepper, who bought the team in 2018, made the decision to move on from Rivera as he wanted to build his own approach for the team. Rivera finished his career with the Panthers with four playoff appearances and a total record of 79–67–1, both of which rank first all-time in team history.

===Washington Redskins / Football Team / Commanders===

On January 1, 2020, Rivera was hired to become the 30th head coach of the Washington Football Team, known as the Redskins at his time of hiring. At his introductory press conference, Rivera stated that he was convinced that the team was the right fit for him after having meetings with former Washington owner Daniel Snyder and former head coach Joe Gibbs, which started almost immediately after he was fired from the Panthers. Rivera hired several former assistant coaches that worked under him with the Panthers, assigning Scott Turner, the son of Norv Turner, as offensive coordinator and former Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio as defensive coordinator. Rivera was also granted considerable authority over roster personnel, with him acting as the team&#x27;s de facto general manager until the team hired Martin Mayhew for the role in 2021. However, Rivera retained the final say in football matters. For instance, Mayhew reported to him; most NFL head coaches report to the general manager.

Rivera&#x27;s first season with the team was met with many challenges, including implementing a new culture, assisting the process of changing the team&#x27;s name, dealing with a vastly altered season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and being diagnosed with cancer and undergoing treatment for it during the season. Rivera released quarterback Dwayne Haskins in December after on-field struggles and off-the-field controversies throughout the year. Despite all the adversities, Rivera led the team to a NFC East title with a record of 7–9, mirroring his 2014 Panthers team that also won the division with a losing record.

In the 2021 offseason, Rivera chose to bring in journeyman quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and made him the starting quarterback over Taylor Heinicke despite showing a lack of understanding of the offense during the preseason. Fitzpatrick was injured in the first game of regular season, which resulted in Heinicke being the starter for the rest of the season with a final record of 7–10.

During the 2022 offseason, Carson Wentz was traded to the team with Rivera publicly stating he was directly responsible for the move in order for Wentz to be his new starting quarterback. Following Week 6 and a 2–4 record, Rivera named Heinicke as his starter again due to Wentz being placed on injured reserve. Despite Heinicke managing to keep the Commanders in playoff contention with five wins, three losses and one tie, and needing to win the last two remaining games of the regular season in order to make the playoffs, Rivera benched him in favor of Wentz ahead of Week 17. The Commanders lost in Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, and Rivera was widely criticized for his post-game interview where he showed a lack of awareness that a Vikings loss to the Packers would result in the Commanders being eliminated from playoff contention. The Commanders finished the season with a 8–8–1 record.

Rivera replaced Scott Turner with former Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy in 2023, additionally giving him the title of assistant head coach. For the 2023 season, Rivera announced that Sam Howell would be the team&#x27;s starting quarterback. Rivera took over as interim defensive coordinator for the second half of the season after Jack Del Rio was fired following a 45–10 road loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving, with the team having allowed the most points in the NFL by that point in the season. The Commanders were eliminated from playoff contention following a Week 15 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. After the Commanders finished the 2023 season with a 4–13 record, Rivera was fired on January 8, 2024.

===California===
On February 5, 2025, Rivera announced a return to his alma mater, California, in a general manager-like administrative role managing their budget and football staff.

==Head coaching record==
==Analyst &amp; speaking career==
In March 2024, Rivera was hired by ESPN as an analyst for NFL Live and works select games as an analyst for Westwood One.

In April 2022, Rivera joined the Washington Speakers Bureau as an exclusive speaker, where he pulls from his years as a player, coaching career, and personal experiences to motivate and inspire audiences.

==Personal life==

Rivera is Catholic and has three brothers: Steven, Mickey, and John. He is married to Stephanie (), whom he met while at Cal in August 1983. They got married in 1984. Stephanie, a Filipino American, was a point guard for the Golden Bears women&#x27;s basketball team in the early 1980s and later served as a coach for the sport, most notably as an assistant for the Washington Mystics of the WNBA in 2000. The couple have two children: Christopher and Courtney. Courtney played for the UCLA Bruins softball team in the early 2010s and has worked as a social media producer under Rivera in Carolina and Washington. Rivera&#x27;s nephew, Vincent, was hired as a defensive quality control coach under him in Washington in 2020.

Rivera&#x27;s idol while growing up was Puerto Rican baseball player Roberto Clemente, who died in a plane crash while en route to deliver aid to victims of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake. Rivera was inducted into the California Athletics Hall of Fame in 1994. On January 5, 2015, his home in Charlotte, North Carolina caught fire and was partially damaged, but Rivera and his family escaped without injury. Rivera held a charity yard sale there after his hiring as Washington head coach in 2020, with various Panthers apparel and merchandise up for sale that raised more than 30,000 for the humane society of Charlotte.

In August 2020, Rivera was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in a lymph node of his neck. Rivera has a family history with cancer; his father Eugenio was diagnosed with it while his brother Mickey died from pancreatic cancer in 2015 and his mother Dolores from lung cancer in 2022. However, Rivera&#x27;s diagnosis was discovered in its early stage. He underwent a seven-week treatment regimen that included 35 proton therapy appointments and three cycles of chemotherapy. Although Rivera missed only a total of three practices, he lost over 30 pounds and had to receive intravenous therapy during halftime of some games to relieve fatigue. A campaign known as &quot;Rivera Strong&quot; was organized by the team to support him. Rivera was considered cancer free by late January 2021. In April 2021, he donated $100,000 to Rich Eisen&#x27;s Run Rich Run charity event for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. Rivera was later awarded the 2022 George Halas Award by the Pro Football Writers of America for the adversity he dealt with.

<text>Onehunga is a suburb of Auckland in New Zealand and the location of the Port of Onehunga, the city&#x27;s small port on the Manukau Harbour. It is south of the city centre, close to the volcanic cone of Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill.

Onehunga is a residential and light-industrial suburb. There are almost 1,000 commercial and industrial businesses in the area. Onehunga stretches south from Royal Oak to the northern shore of the Manukau Harbour. To the east are the areas of Oranga and Te Papapa; to the west, Hillsborough. On the southern shore of the Manukau Harbour, and linked to Onehunga by two bridges, is the suburb of Māngere Bridge.

== Geography ==
Onehunga lies on the Auckland isthmus, on the northern shore of Mangere Inlet, an arm of the Manukau Harbour, and just south of the volcanic cone of Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill. The Port of Onehunga, on Manukau Harbour, is now much smaller than Auckland&#x27;s east coast port on the Waitematā Harbour, but in the 19th century it was the larger. The wharves are located on reclaimed land bordering a low volcanic crater called Te Hopua, once occupied by a tidal lagoon opening to the southwest, but which has also been reclaimed.

Onehunga&#x27;s southwestern side, near the Manukau Harbour, lost its direct waterfront access when the Southwest Motorway was built there in the 1970s. Only a tidal lagoon remains on the city side, though in 2008, there were proposals that the motorway (which was to be widened) could be sunk into a trench to provide direct access to the harbour again. In 2013, a project was underway to restore the Onehunga foreshore, to be connected to the city-side park by a pedestrian and cycle bridge over State Highway 20.

A substantial aquifer flows underground beneath Onehunga, fed by rainwater soaking through the lava flows around Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill. Up to 21 million litres of potable water a day is pumped from the Onehunga aquifer and treated in a local plant before being supplied to Onehunga as part of the Auckland water supply network. While most of Auckland&#x27;s potable water comes from reservoirs in the Hunua and Waitākere Ranges, or from the Waikato River, the Onehunga aquifer provides around 5%. In contrast, while the isthmus&#x27;s other major aquifer, the Western Springs aquifer, is also fed by water seeping through lava fields, it is no longer used as a source of potable water.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Onehunga&quot; is from the Māori language and means a &quot;beach composed of mixed sand and mud&quot; or &quot;alluvial soil&quot;, according to Williams&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Maori Language&quot;.

Claims have been made for other names and meanings. Ethnographer George Graham was told by one Māori informant that the name was &quot;Ōnehunga&quot;, with the etymology of &quot;ō&quot; (the place of) &quot;nehunga&quot; (burial), but Graham said that was later contradicted. He said that the name was actually &quot;Oneunga&quot; (&quot;Oneūnga&quot; in modern orthography), meaning &quot;one&quot; (beach or sand) &quot;ūnga&quot; (landing), in reference to canoes being drawn up there. He also said that &quot;Onehunga&quot; meant &quot;friable&quot; or &quot;pulverous soil&quot; and that this was &quot;a very correct name&quot;.

The New Zealand Geographic Board approved &quot;Onehunga&quot; as the official name in 2019.

=== Māori origins ===

Onehunga was close to one of the richest areas of the Auckland isthmus, and saw many battles between Māori groups in pre-European times. In the late 1830s, before Europeans arrived in larger numbers in the area, it was the main settlement for Ngāti Whātua, who had moved back to the northern shore of the Manukau Harbour after retreating to the Waikato during the Musket Wars.

=== Early European town ===
The European village of Onehunga was founded as a Fencible settlement by Governor Grey. The Fencibles were former soldiers, many of them Irish, who were granted land to settle on, with the implied understanding that if Māori threatened the Auckland isthmus, they would defend it. Onehunga was the first village for Fencibles in New Zealand. Grey chose the site in 1846 and the Fencibles arrived in 1847.

European settlement of the Manukau Harbour area was begun from and long focused on Onehunga. When the New Zealand Wars later occurred, it was mostly fought with regular soldiers rather than Fencibles. Naval volunteers based at Onehunga raided Māori territories on the south side of the harbour during the wars.

During the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863 many women and children from small European settlements arrived in Onehunga as refugees. The Onehunga Ladies&#x27; Benevolent Society was formed to care for the refugees.
It was the oldest surviving women&#x27;s organisation in New Zealand at the time of its deregistration in 2017.

During the 19th century most shipping between New Zealand and Great Britain came to Onehunga, via South Africa and Australia. While some shipping entered the Waitematā Harbour and docked at Auckland, much of it entered the Manukau Heads and docked at Onehunga, thus saving several days sailing around North Cape. The Manukau Harbour was treacherous however (as evidenced by the sinking of HMS &quot;Orpheus&quot; in 1863, killing 180 people) but the coastal Steamship lines carried virtually all passenger and freight trade between Auckland and Wellington via Wanganui and Onehunga.

Onehunga was also the main route to and from the south, as most shipping routes were shorter via the western coast of the North Island than around the east coast to the Waitematā Harbour. Until 1908 a steamer from Onehunga was the fastest means of travel from Auckland to Wellington, the capital of the colony (initially the sea journey went all the way, then later it connected to the New Plymouth Express instead). In 1909 a typical coastal freight connection was a steamer from Onehunga to locations such as Raglan, Kawhia and Waitara. Onehunga was the Northern Steamship&#x27;s base for serving the west coast, including also Āwhitu, Hokianga and Waiuku.

By the First World War Onehunga was no longer an important commercial port, this was partly because of a general increase in the size of ships, which meant the Waitematā Harbour was favoured especially as it was wider and deeper. More significant however was the completion of the North Island Main Trunk railway in 1908 – this effectively made the coastal passenger and freight steamship trade on both coasts of the country largely unprofitable. The port does still serve coastal traders and some local fishing, there is also a cement and sand company which maintains facilities at Onehunga.

In 1874, the town of Onehunga had 2,044 inhabitants, compared with Wellington&#x27;s 10,547, reflecting the importance of the smaller port towns during an age when New Zealand was booming, but internal transport links were still rudimentary. In 1876, Onehunga was declared a borough with a mayor and 16 councillors.

From 1883, until around 1903 when it was partially demolished, the Onehunga Ironworks was situated in the town. It operated until around 1895. The ironworks was located opposite the original Onehunga railway station. Its chimney and some structures survived into the late 1960s.

From 1885, the town became known for its wool industry (several firms maintained factories here including one which produced blankets). This weaving industry saved the area from more serious decline when the shipping trade reduced after 1908. As the centre of the Auckland isthmus became covered by suburban developments the Onehunga foreshore became an attraction for families from Mount Eden, Epsom and One Tree Hill. The beach at Onehunga became popular after the electric tram route was completed in 1906 and the Tea Rooms situated at the tram terminus, overlooking the harbour were an attraction in their own right.

After the Municipal Abattoir was relocated from Freeman&#x27;s Bay to Westfield and Southdown, Onehunga started to suffer from the toxic discharges the freezing works pumped into the harbour. This effectively put an end to Onehunga&#x27;s emerging role as a seaside resort and also made it a less attractive place to live. By the late 1930s the water quality of the harbour was poor, with a discernible downturn in fish and wildlife numbers. It became unsafe to eat any shellfish for example and fish numbers dwindled. The installation of a large sewerage treatment plant in the harbour in the 1960s only made things worse. Since the decommissioning of the freezing works at Westfield and Southdown and a redesign of the Manukau Sewerage Treatment Works, the quality of the water has increased significantly.

In 1893, Elizabeth Yates became mayor of Onehunga. While she was defeated at the polls only one year later, she was the first woman in the British Empire to hold such a post.

===Merging with Auckland===
While in 1891 Onehunga was one of the &quot;25 most populous urban areas/towns of New Zealand&quot;, with about 5,000 inhabitants, by the First World War it had ceased to be a port of importance. It gained a new role as a shopping and service centre as it was engulfed by the suburban development of Auckland, and was amalgamated with Auckland City in 1989.

Onehunga had for a short time Auckland&#x27;s first zoo. However, the zoological garden that John James Boyd created near today&#x27;s Royal Oak did not meet with local approval – mainly due to concerns about the smells and crowds. Eleven years after its November 1911 opening, the animals were bought and transferred to the new Auckland Zoo at Western Springs.

Although the area was a predominantly working-class suburb for much of the 20th century, it has undergone some gentrification since the 1990s. In recent times, many of the bungalows of the 1920s (along with the earlier villas) have undergone restoration. Secondary schools located conveniently are Onehunga High School, One Tree Hill College and Marcellin College. Some boys also attend St Peter&#x27;s College.

== Local government ==
Onehunga had its own local government authority, Onehunga Borough Council, which started in 1877. It merged into Auckland City Council in 1989. All of Auckland&#x27;s councils amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

== Foreshore ==
Onehunga&#x27;s shore is heavily modified by human use. The old volcanic basin that used to link to the Manukau Harbour was filled in, with shorelines reclaimed and straightened for human use (Port of Onehunga, industrial uses and sports fields). The New Zealand State Highway 20 extension further disrupted Onehunga&#x27;s connection to the shore in the 1970s.

This loss of amenity and space was one of the major complaints of local groups during negotiations over further motorway widening connected to the Māngere Bridge duplication. Proponents of a restored beach eventually won a $18 million commitment from Transit New Zealand (now NZ Transport Agency), which was topped up by a further $10 million from Auckland City Council. The sum is to fund a large-scale new shoreline west of the motorway, connected to downtown Onehunga with new pedestrian/cyclebridges, and creating 11ha of new beach and headland landscape. Three designs out of seven initial competitors have been shortlisted for further work as of late 2009, and it is hoped to complete the restoration of the foreshore by mid-2014.

In mid-2011, the plans for the restoration works were clarified further, and provided for public comment, setting out a reclamation area with sanded beaches, new green open space and several new headlands. The area is to receive a new boat ramp, and walk and cycleways including a new walking and cycling bridge over the motorway to Onehunga. Construction has started on 19 November 2012.

The newly named Taumanu Reserve was officially opened to the public on 14 November 2015, in an event attended by over a thousand people.

== Transport ==

Onehunga Line rail services carry passengers between Onehunga railway station and central Auckland&#x27;s Britomart Transport Centre along the Onehunga Branch line to a junction with the main line at Penrose station. The Campaign for Better Transport campaigned to have the line extended south from Onehunga across the SH20 Manukau Harbour second crossing bridge to Auckland Airport. Former Auckland Mayor Len Brown also campaigned for this Auckland Airport Line, though it will likely only be developed after the City Rail Link is completed.

Electric services began running between Britomart and Onehunga on 28 April 2014.

Queen St, named after Queen Victoria, led onto the 1920s Māngere Bridge and thence to the suburb of the same name. This was one of the main land routes south out of Auckland and the usual route to the airport until the motorway and regional road system in the 1970s diverted the through traffic away from the Onehunga and Mangere Bridge.

In 1973, Queen St was closed to through traffic, and on 2 April 1973 was renamed Onehunga Mall and reopened as a pedestrian shopping precinct. In 1996, Onehunga Mall was reopened to traffic.

Until 1956, a tram line ran all the way from the Auckland CBD to Onehunga.

==Notable buildings==
=== Onehunga Post Office (Former) ===
The Onehunga Post Office was built in 1901-2, in an Edwardian Baroque post office style, during a boom in post office construction throughout New Zealand in the early 20th century. Designed by Government Architect John Campbell, it is one of the earliest examples of the work of this prolific architect. Construction was completed on 3 February 1902, opening officially on 14 February 1902 and attended by a number of members of Parliament including Sir Joseph Ward. The building hosted essential public services such as mail, banking, and telegraph facilities. The former Post Office is located on the corner of Princes Street &amp; Onehunga Mall Road (formerly Queen Street). By the 1990s the building was neglected and set for demolition, this was until the local community rallied and the building was refurbished in 1994-5. Since, it has hosted multiple hospitality businesses.

A new hotel designed by architect James Wrigley, opened in December 1879 on the same site. The building has seen significant alteration since its construction, both in 1892 by J. Huntley Allen and by Charles Arnold in 1906. It has been in continuous use as a hotel and public house since its reconstruction in 1879. It now operates as a restaurant and is widely recognised as a historical and social landmark of the area.

The Arch of Remembrance, is located in Jellicoe Park on Quadrant Road &amp; Grey Street. The park itself opened in 1923 by the Governor General, Lord Jellicoe, and is the site of Onehunga&#x27;s Public Swimming Pools which opened in 1956. The Arch of Remembrance was officially unveiled on 20 October 1929 as a memorial for WWI and WWII. It is made from locally sourced scoria and its initial construction was overseen by John Park. Since its inception it has served as a commemorative site for the local community.

<doc id="1193489" wikidata="Q1395089" url="?curid=1193489" title="Horseshoe curve">
<text>A horseshoe curve is a class of climbing curve in a roadbed that reverses turn direction (inflection) twice on either side of a single tight curve that varies through an angle of about 180 degrees or more.

Such curves are more commonly found in a railway line but are also used in roads. The characteristic U shape, or even slight balloon shape, of such a curve resembles a horseshoe. On roadways, particularly tight versions of such curves are typically called hairpin turns.

== Theory ==
A horseshoe curve is a means to lengthen an ascending or descending grade and thereby reduce the maximum gradient. Grade or gradient is defined as the rise divided by the run (length) or distance, so in principle such curves add to length for the same altitude gain, just as would a climbing spiral around one or more peaks, or a climbing traverse (cutting) wrapping around an end of a ridge.

If the straight route between two points is too steep to climb, a more circuitous route will increase the distance traveled, allowing the difference in altitude to be averaged over a longer track (or road) length. Unlike a spiral, a horseshoe curve does not involve the track crossing over itself, and the full horseshoe involves both relatively straight sections, curve deflections in both directions and tightly curved segment; while a spiral generally has a more uniform curvature. Obviously, a horseshoe also gives rise to a severe change in direction requiring another corrective curve to regain displacement in the overall direction of travel, while a spiral generally does not.

A horseshoe curve is sometimes used where the route bridges a deep gully. Deviating from a straight-line route along the edge of the gully may allow it to be crossed at a better location.

Horseshoe curves are common on railway lines in steeply graded or hilly country, where means must be found to achieve acceptable grades and minimize construction costs. As with spirals, the main limitation in laying out a horseshoe is keeping its radius as large as possible, as sharp curves limit train speed, and through increased friction, are harder on rails, requiring more frequent replacement of outer tracks.

==Examples==

===Europe===
====Germany====
* The Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn in Germany has a horseshoe curve in Neviges, Velbert on the route between Essen and Wuppertal, known as the Prince William railway.

====Norway====
* The Dovre Line, the main line of the Norwegian railway network, has a horseshoe within Grønbogen tunnel from Dombås at the steep hills to the Dovre plateau, standard gauge, single track.
* The Flåm Line, Norway, has a double horseshoe, one inside a tunnel, one in the open, few kilometres below top station, standard gauge, single track.
* The Rauma Line, Norway, has a double horseshoe through the steep and narrow valley at Verma, one inside a tunnel and one that includes the Kylling Bridge, standard gauge, single track.

====Poland====
* Grybów, Poland has a horseshoe curve 2,5 km west of the town.
* Kalisz, Poland has a double horseshoe curve leading the tracks from a flat plateau down to the valley of the Prosna river.
* Between Jelenia Góra and Szklarska Poręba in Poland there is a five-times, elongated horseshoe curve (50°51′19&quot;N, 15°34′17&quot;E). Map

====Slovakia====
*In Slovakia there is a significant number of horseshoe curves on the Banská Bystrica to Turčianske Teplice railway track and on the railway from Zvolen to Turčianske Teplice. More than 20 tunnels and couple of horseshoe curves were built to overcome rough terrain and elevation differences.

====United Kingdom====
* Newcastle Quayside branch, a goods-only railway from the main line to the river quayside, through a steeply descending horseshoe tunnel.
*The horseshoe curve on the West Highland Line in Scotland between Upper Tyndrum and Bridge of Orchy was built because the engineers of the railway couldn&#x27;t afford to build a viaduct crossing the remote valley.

===North America===
====United States====
Pennsylvania
* Coles Curve; Coles, Pennsylvania. Built by East Broad Top Railroad to gauge
* Horseshoe Curve, the four-track route built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) that starts its climb along Kittanning Run due west of Altoona, and crosses two runs and three mountain faces using three gaps of the Allegheny
* Mance Curve, between Meyersdale and Hyndman, Pennsylvania, along Sand Patch Grade. Long operated by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, it is today part of CSX Transportation&#x27;s Keystone Subdivision) used by freight trains and Amtrak&#x27;s Capitol Limited (Chicago-Washington, D.C.) passenger train
* Muleshoe Curve, a former PRR line near Duncansville
Alaska
* In the Loop District of the Alaska Railroad between mileposts 48 and 51 northeast of Seward, Alaska, there was a horseshoe and a spiral, both on an extensive range of timber trestles up to 106 feet high. In 1951, a new route removed the original horseshoe, the spiral and all the trestles but added a new horseshoe at milepost 48.

<doc id="1193502" wikidata="Q955727" url="?curid=1193502" title="Shimazu Yoshihisa">
<text>was a powerful &quot;daimyō&quot; and the 16th Chief of Shimazu clan of Satsuma Province, the eldest son of Shimazu Takahisa. He was renowned as a great general, who managed to subjugate Kyushu through the deft maneuvering of his three brothers. Eventually, in 1585, Yoshihisa seceded control of the entire Kyushu region.

==Early life and rise==
His mother was a daughter of &quot;Iriki&#x27;in Shigesato&quot; (入来院重聡), &quot;Sesshō&quot; (雪窓). Shimazu Yoshihiro, Shimazu Toshihisa and Shimazu Iehisa were his brothers. He is said to have been born in Izaku Castle in 1535. His childhood name was &quot;Torajumaru&quot; (虎寿丸) but he went by the name of &quot;Matasaburō&quot; (又三郎). On his coming-of-age (genpuku), he took the name of &quot;Tadayoshi&quot;(忠良) but after receiving a kanji from the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru, changed to &quot;Yoshitatsu&quot; (義辰). He later changed his name to &quot;Yoshihisa&quot;. He married his own aunt and after her death, married his relative, a daughter of Tanegashima Tokitaka. 

In 1566, he succeeded his father as the head of Shimazu clan, becoming the clan&#x27;s sixteenth leader.

==Unification of Kyushu==
Working together with his brothers Yoshihiro, Toshihisa, and Iehisa, he launched a campaign to unify Kyūshū.

Starting in 1572 with a victory against Itō clan at the battle of Kizaki and the Siege of Takabaru in 1576,
Yoshihisa continued to win battles.

In 1578, Yoshihisa defeated the Ōtomo clan at the battle of Mimigawa and pursuit the Ōtomo army to they homeland, though he did not take their territory; 

Later, in 1581, Yoshihisa forces took Minamata castle in Higo Province with a force of 115,000 men;

In early 1584, his forces was victorious in Battle of Okitanawate In Hizen Province against Ryūzōji clan and defeated the Aso clan.

In 1585, Yoshihisa forces attack Horikiri Castle at Chikugo Province and later took Otomo&#x27;s Iwaya castle resulted after the Shimazu invasion of Chikuzen Province.

By the middle of 1585, the Shimazu clan controlled; Chikugo, Chikuzen, Hizen, Higo, Hyūga, Osumi, and Satsuma, most of Kyūshū with the exception of Ōtomo&#x27;s domain and unification was a feasible goal.

==Conflict with Hideyoshi==
In 1585, during Shimazu&#x27;s attempt to unify Kyushu, other Kyushu clans appealed to Toyotomi Hideyoshi for help; the Otomo clan and Ryuzoji clan asked Hideyoshi for aid, and though he had been unable to help at that time, Hideyoshi interceded, requesting that Yoshihisa make peace with Otomo. In response, Yoshihisa derided his attempt to intervene, not seeing Hideyoshi as being in a position to invade Kyushu. 

In 1586, Shimazu Yoshihisa marched to attack Otomo&#x27;s Tachibana castle, when the commanders of the Shimazu army arrived near Tachibana castle. Tachibana Muneshige led the defense of the castle with his wife, the former clan leader Tachibana Ginchiyo. 
Later, the Otomo leaders travelled to Osaka itself, seeking to persuade Hideyoshi to help. Hideyoshi was impressed with this embassy, and presumably agreed to help. Yoshihisa, seeing that Hideyoshi was prepared to invade, sent a message to Hideyoshi, claiming that he had attacked the other clans in self-defence, but Hideyoshi refused and leads his forces to Kyushu.

===Kyushu campaign===

In late 1586, Kyushu Campaign by Toyotomi Hideyoshi begin.
The Ōtomo forces, were supported by Shikoku armies under Chōsokabe Motochika, Sengoku Hidehisa and Sogō Masayasu, they delayed Shimazu forces and weakened them in preparation for the arrival of Hideyoshi&#x27;s armies.
Hideyoshi mobilised a force of 200,000 soldiers and 20,000 pack animals, transporting supplies for an even larger army of 300,000 men. Toyotomi Hidenaga led the vanguard of 25,000 men and 3,000 horses. 

By April 1587 Hideyoshi had reached the straits at Shimonoseki, moving through Chikuzen and Chikugo to attack Yoshihisa in Higo. At this point Mōri forces under Kobayakawa Takakage joined Hidenaga&#x27;s force, as the Mōri had been recently suppressed. Hidenaga then drove back the Shimazu forces in Hyūga and Bungo. The Shimazu fought well, but had few firearms and lacked discipline and training; they were steadily overwhelmed through the superior quality &quot;and&quot; quantity. 

By the end of May 1587, the various island daimyos had turned to Hideyoshi&#x27;s side. In June, Shimazu was routed in Satsuma itself, and Hideyoshi laid Siege of Kagoshima castle. Yoshihisa sued for peace, and a truce was agreed. Hideyoshi offered generous terms for a lasting peace to son of Yoshihiro&#x27;s and Iehisa&#x27;s; though Yoshihisa initially refused the offer, Hideyoshi tried again and was this time successful.

==After surrender==

Most of the domains Yoshihisa had conquered were given by Hideyoshi to three of his senior generals - Kato, Konishi, and Kuroda - and the Shimazu clan managed to retain only Satsuma Province and Ōsumi Province, as well as half of Hyuga. The Mori were given fiefs in northern Kyushu, and Kobayakawa gained Chikuzen. Yoshihisa shaved his head to surrender, showing that he would become a Buddhist monk if his life was spared. His name as a monk was &quot;Ryūhaku&quot; (龍伯) but it is unclear whether he retired in order to allow Yoshihiro to rule. As a retainer under Hideyoshi, his younger brother Yoshihiro controlled troops, but it is believed that Yoshihisa still managed day-to-day affairs in the domain. Yoshihisa did not have a son to succeed him, so he had Yoshihiro&#x27;s son, Shimazu Tadatsune marry the third daughter &quot;Shimazu&quot; &quot;Kameju&quot; (亀寿) and adopted him as the successor.

Yoshihisa&#x27;s knowledge of culture is not known, but after Hideyoshi granted Hosokawa Fujitaka a retirement estate at Osumi Province in 1595, Fujitaka taught him classic literatures, and Kampaku Konoe Wakihisa, who was skilled in waka and renga, is believed to have frequented Yoshihisa&#x27;s house. He initially looked favourably on Christian missionaries such as Luís de Almeida.

After his domain was split up by Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu invited Yoshihisa to Fushimi Castle. Ieyasu and his retainers repeatedly asked Yoshihisa how he managed to unify Kyushu; eventually, Yoshihisa relented, saying that he won his victories through his retainers - &quot;[Because] my three younger brothers, led by Yoshihiro, as well as retainers like Uwai Satokane and Yamada Arinobu, fought so well united under the same goal, I never had a chance to show my bravery in a battle. I only had to wait in the castle for news brought by messengers of their victories&quot;. After Yoshihisa left, Ieyasu told his retainers that - &quot;[Yoshihisa had, as] a general let retainers under him work to the best of their abilities. This is how a great general should be&quot;.

==Death==

On January 21 in 1611, he died of illness in Kokubu Castle. Posthumously, he was named 貫明存忠庵主. He was buried at what had once been the site of Fukushoji in Kagoshima - his tombstone remains, along with those of the other leaders of his clan. There are also monuments built in his memory at Kokubun, &quot;Ima Kumano Kannonji&quot; (今熊野観音寺) in Kyoto, and Koyasan. Though there is no portrait of Yoshihisa remaining, there is a bronze figure of Yoshihisa at the Taiheiji, depicting his surrender to Hideyoshi. The statue was produced after he died.

<text>Pierre Varignon (; 1654 – 23 December 1722) was a French mathematician. He was educated at the Jesuit College and the University of Caen, where he received his M.A. in 1682. He took Holy Orders the following year.

Varignon gained his first exposure to mathematics by reading Euclid and then Descartes&#x27; &quot;La Géométrie&quot;. He became professor of mathematics at the Collège Mazarin in Paris in 1688 and was elected to the Académie Royale des Sciences in the same year. In 1704, he held the departmental chair at Collège Mazarin and also became professor of mathematics at the Collège Royal. He was elected to the Berlin Academy in 1713 and to the Royal Society in 1718. Many of his works were published in Paris in 1725, three years after his death. His lectures at Mazarin were published in &quot;Elements de mathematique&quot; in 1731.

Varignon was a friend of Newton, Leibniz, and the Bernoulli family. Varignon&#x27;s principal contributions were to graphic statics and mechanics. Except for l&#x27;Hôpital, Varignon was the earliest and strongest French advocate of infinitesimal calculus, and exposed the errors in Michel Rolle&#x27;s critique thereof. He recognized the importance of a test for the convergence of series, but analytical difficulties prevented his success. Nevertheless, he simplified the proofs of many propositions in mechanics, adapted Leibniz&#x27;s calculus to the inertial mechanics of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;, and treated mechanics in terms of the composition of forces in &quot;Projet d&#x27;une nouvelle mécanique&quot; in 1687. Among Varignon&#x27;s other works was a 1699 publication concerning the application of differential calculus to fluid flow and to water clocks. In 1690, he created a mechanical explanation of gravitation. In 1702, he applied calculus to spring-driven clocks. In 1704, he invented the U-tube manometer, a device capable of measuring rarefaction in gases.

<text>Lance Corporal John William Sayer (12 April 1879 – 18 April 1918) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 38 years old, and a Lance Corporal in the 8th Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey Regiment), British Army during the
First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 March 1918 at Le Verguier, France, Lance Corporal Sayer held the flank of a small isolated post for two hours. Owing to mist the enemy approached from both sides to within 30 yards before being discovered, but the lance corporal, on his own initiative without assistance, beat off a succession of attacks, inflicting heavy losses. During the whole time he was exposed to heavy fire but his contempt of danger and skill in the use of his fire-arms enabled the post to hold out until nearly all the garrison had been killed and he himself wounded and captured. He died as a result of wounds four weeks later.

<doc id="1193516" wikidata="Q870443" url="?curid=1193516" title="Die Weltwoche">
<text>Die Weltwoche (, &quot;The World Week&quot;) is a Swiss weekly magazine based in Zürich. Founded in 1933, it has been privately owned by Roger Köppel since 2006.

The magazine&#x27;s regular columnists include the former president of the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, Peter Bodenmann, as well as Christoph Mörgeli MP, a leading figure of the right wing Swiss People&#x27;s Party, and cultural and social commentator Alexander, Count von Schönburg-Glauchau.

The magazine&#x27;s editorial stance under Köppel is considered to range between economic liberalism and conservatism – regularly along the lines of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party, as critics allege.

==History==
Founded in 1933 as a weekly newspaper in the mold of French weeklies, it started off somewhat sympathetic to the Nazi government of Germany, but soon joined the other Swiss media in vigorously opposing it.

During the 1980s, the newspaper was led by Rudolf Bächtold and Jürg Ramspeck and owned by Jean Frey Verlag. &quot;Weltwoche&quot; remained a fixture of the intellectual environment in Switzerland, publishing articles, columns and interviews on a wide range of topics, including politics, the economy, culture and science, generally from a center-left perspective. In 1987, Jean Frey Verlag was bought up by notorious entrepreneur and fraudster Werner Rey. After the collapse of Rey&#x27;s holdings in 1991, the publisher was sold to Curti Medien Holding AG, which in 1996 passed to &quot;Basler Zeitung&quot;. The last editor in chief before the takeover by Köppel was Fredy Gsteiger (1997 to 2001), under whom the newspaper pursued a general political position of center-left liberalism.

Köppel became editor-in-chief in 2001, launching a complete redesign, replacing the broadsheet by a magazine format. Jean Frey AG was now bought by conservative-right investor Tito Tettamanti. Köppel replaced most of the editors and re-positioned the magazine as neoliberal and right-wing conservative. In 2003, the new &quot;Weltwoche&quot; began to openly support Christoph Blocher and his Swiss People&#x27;s Party. This resulted in a decline in sales, and Köppel was replaced by Simon Heusser, in 2005 followed by Jürg Wildberger.

In 2006, the &quot;Weltwoche&quot; was detached from Jean Frey AG, now published under its own label &quot;Weltwoche Verlag AG&quot;. 
The magazine was bought by Köppel, who now also returned as editor-in-chief, resulting in a renewed exodus of much of the editors. Since 2006, the paper has been run by Köppel directly and has acquired a thoroughly right-wing conservative focus.

In 2015, the editor-in-chief and owner Roger Köppel joined the strong right-wing Swiss People&#x27;s Party. Shortly after, he was elected for Councillor of the Swiss Parliament and now stands in for the interest of the Swiss People&#x27;s Party also in Parliament.

==Profile and positions==
Already distinguishing itself somewhat from the generally liberal, right-conservative, or center-left Swiss media by its general right-wing orientation, the magazine is now especially noted for its interviews with controversial public figures and for the diversity of opinion represented in its pages, with a dominant right-wing view however. For instance, virtually alone among Swiss publications, &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot; in 2003 and 2004 printed lengthy articles mainly arguing for the 2003 invasion of Iraq or the reelection of George W. Bush to the U.S. presidency. The accession of Switzerland to the European Union is rejected by the editorial staff, as was Swiss acceptance of the Schengen Agreement. The Weltwoche also represents the view that welfare and other state-administered assistance programs are inherently flawed.

Since 2006, &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot; has repeatedly actively created controversy and scandal. The magazine is somewhat anti-statist and against an expansion of the welfare state. It also rejects state-subsidized nurseries and childcare.

In keeping with its neo-conservative and anti-mainstream positions, the &quot;Weltwoche&quot; does not accept the scientific evidence for global warming and has denounced recent &quot;alarmism&quot; surrounding environmental issues. Internationally – outside of Europe – the &quot;Weltwoche&quot; often represents pro-American and pro-Israeli positions.
On 12 January 2006, &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot; was the first German-speaking publication to reprint some of the controversial cartoons of Muhammad originally published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten.

On 12 May 2010, the main title of the weekly edition of the &quot;Weltwoche&quot; was: &quot;Must Islam be Banned?&quot; (&quot;Muss der Islam verboten werden?&quot;), the article stating that Muslim religion is incompatible with the Swiss constitution. The front cover of the &quot;Weltwoche&quot; of 5 April 2012 published a photograph of a Roma child pointing a gun at a camera under the headline &quot;The Roma are coming&quot;. The controversy sparked by this choice of illustration was reported internationally.

On 26 June 2012, &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot; published an article which lamented the spread of the Irish gene pool and falsely claimed that the Irish Government requires pre-marital DNA testing in an effort to halt supposed widespread incest amongst the Irish who, it was further claimed, have rat-like anatomic features. The article was translated into English and caused controversy in the Irish media.

==Circulation==
In 1997, &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot; had a circulation of 91,142 copies. Between July 2004 and June 2005 the circulation of the magazine was 80,436 copies. It was 82,849 copies between July 2005 and June 2006 and 85,772 copies between July 2006 and June 2007. Its total circulation in 2006 was also 82,849 copies. It became 85,096 copies between July 2007 and June 2008, dropping to 45,519 copies in 2019.

<text>Global a Go-Go is the second album by Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros, released on 24 July 2001. As the title suggests, there are world music influences on the album, mostly on the title track and &quot;Bhindi Bhagee&quot;, a celebration of the &quot;humble&quot; but diverse and exciting ethnic and multi-cultural areas of London and other major cities. The album is heavy on acoustic instruments, especially in the instrumental &quot;Minstrel Boy&quot;, a nearly 18-minute-long arrangement of a traditional Irish song. Other topics covered include Strummer&#x27;s radio show, which was broadcast on the BBC World Service (&quot;Global a Go-Go&quot;) and left-wing political issues Strummer was well known for expounding as a member of The Clash. The album was well received by critics and fans, making much more of an impact than the group&#x27;s previous effort &quot;Rock Art and the X-Ray Style&quot;. The title track, &quot;Global A Go-Go&quot;, features backing vocals from longtime friend of Strummer, Roger Daltrey. Pete Townshend is also rumoured to be buried in the mix of &quot;Minstrel Boy&quot;, but this has never been positively confirmed. The cover-art for the album was designed by Josh Shoes and Strummer.

The lead track and album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot; was the opening theme to the HBO show &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot;. A music video for the song was also filmed. A different version of &quot;Minstrel Boy&quot; was used as the closing track on the Ridley Scott film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. This film version, which can also be found on the soundtrack, is significantly shorter and does feature the actual lyrics to the song. The &quot;Minstrel Boy&quot; track is also known as the &quot;Worldcom Dirge&quot; after being featured in a commercial by the soon-to be-bankrupt telecommunications company. Likewise, &quot;Mondo Bongo&quot; is featured in the Doug Liman film &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot;. In Orphan Black, lines from &quot;Bummed Out City&quot; are recited at Sarah Manning&#x27;s funeral as her eulogy.

A remastered version of the album along with Strummer&#x27;s other two Hellcat released albums was released as a special 57 song digital download titled &quot;Joe Strummer &amp; The Mescaleros: The Hellcat Years&quot; on 21 August 2012 to celebrate what would have been Strummer&#x27;s 60th birthday. Hellcat will also release each remastered album individually on CD and vinyl on 25 September 2012.

<text>Christian Ferdinand Schiess VC (7 April 1856 – 14 December 1884) was a Swiss recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He died in poverty at just 28.

==Biography==

Schiess was born in Burgdorf, Switzerland on 7 April 1856, and spent time in an orphanage after his parents died. In 1870 he joined the French Army and fought in the Franco-Prussian War. Schiess later served in the Armée de l&#x27;Est and thus was interned in his home country when it surrendered there. He went to South Africa in 1877 and volunteered for the last Xhosa War. When the Anglo-Zulu War began the 22-year-old veteran was made a corporal in the Natal Native Contingent of the British Army in South Africa.

On 22 January 1879, at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, Corporal Schiess, in spite of suffering from bad blisters on his foot caused by ill fitting boots, displayed great gallantry when the garrison had retired to the inner line of defence and the Zulus had occupied the wall of mealie bags which had been abandoned. He crept along the wall in order to dislodge one of the enemy and succeeded in killing him and two others before returning to the inner defences.
In 1880 he was awarded the Victoria Cross by General Sir Garnet Wolseley for his services at Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Schiess was the first man serving with a locally raised native unit to receive the Victoria Cross, the &quot;British-only&quot; rule being broken under political pressure, also being the first Swiss national to do so.

After the volunteer forces were disbanded he failed to find work, even from British authorities. He briefly went to India but eventually returned to South Africa. In 1884, he was found on the streets of Cape Town suffering from exposure and malnutrition. The Royal Navy found him, gave him food, and offered him a passage to England on board the &quot;Serapis&quot;. He accepted, but became ill during the voyage and died. His remains were buried at sea at approximately .

It is unknown if there was a portrait of Corporal Schiess. According to some, in Lady Butler&#x27;s painting &quot;The Defence of Rorke&#x27;s Drift&quot; he is shown lying at left against the mealie bags.

==Victoria Cross==
The citation for Schiess&#x27;s Victoria Cross was given as:

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea.

==Recognition in Switzerland==
For many years, Schiess&#x27;s story was almost unknown in his home country. However, in recent years he has been remembered by the Museum of the Swiss Abroad at the Château de Penthes in Geneva and by the Swiss branch of the Royal British Legion.

==Film portrayal==
In the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, Dickie Owen portrays Schiess as a much older soldier than he was during the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift.

<doc id="1193525" wikidata="Q548536" url="?curid=1193525" title="Normal order">
<text>In quantum field theory a product of quantum fields, or equivalently their creation and annihilation operators, is usually said to be normal ordered (also called Wick order) when all creation operators are to the left of all annihilation operators in the product. The process of putting a product into normal order is called normal ordering (also called Wick ordering). The terms antinormal order and antinormal ordering are analogously defined, where the annihilation operators are placed to the left of the creation operators.

Normal ordering of a product of quantum fields or creation and annihilation operators can also be defined in many other ways. Which definition is most appropriate depends on the expectation values needed for a given calculation. Most of this article uses the most common definition of normal ordering as given above, which is appropriate when taking expectation values using the vacuum state of the creation and annihilation operators.

The process of normal ordering is particularly important for a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. When quantizing a classical Hamiltonian there is some freedom when choosing the operator order, and these choices lead to differences in the ground state energy. That&#x27;s why the process can also be used to eliminate the infinite vacuum energy of a quantum field.

==Notation==
If formula_1 denotes an arbitrary product of creation and/or annihilation operators (or equivalently, quantum fields), then the normal ordered form of formula_1 is denoted by formula_3.

An alternative notation is formula_4.

Note that normal ordering is a concept that only makes sense for products of operators. Attempting to apply normal ordering to a sum of operators is not useful as normal ordering is not a linear operation.

==Bosons==

Bosons are particles which satisfy Bose–Einstein statistics. We will now examine the normal ordering of bosonic creation and annihilation operator products.

===Single bosons===
If we start with only one type of boson there are two operators of interest:

* formula_5: the boson&#x27;s creation operator.
* formula_6: the boson&#x27;s annihilation operator.

These satisfy the commutator relationship

:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9

where formula_10 denotes the commutator. We may rewrite the last one as: formula_11

====Examples====
1. We&#x27;ll consider the simplest case first. This is the normal ordering of formula_12:

:formula_13

The expression formula_14 has not been changed because it is &quot;already&quot; in normal order - the creation operator formula_15 is already to the left of the annihilation operator formula_16.

2. A more interesting example is the normal ordering of formula_17: 
:formula_18
Here the normal ordering operation has &quot;reordered&quot; the terms by placing formula_5 to the left of formula_6.

These two results can be combined with the commutation relation obeyed by formula_6 and formula_5 to get

:formula_23
or
:formula_24

This equation is used in defining the contractions used in Wick&#x27;s theorem.

3. An example with multiple operators is:

:formula_25

4. A simple example shows that normal ordering cannot be extended by linearity from the monomials to all operators in a self-consistent way. Assume that we can apply the commutation relations to obtain:

:formula_26

Then, by linearity,

: formula_27

a contradiction.

The implication is that normal ordering is not a linear function on operators, but on the free algebra generated by the operators, i.e. the operators do not satisfy the canonical commutation relations while inside the normal ordering (or any other ordering operator like time-ordering, etc).

===Multiple bosons===
If we now consider formula_28 different bosons there are formula_29 operators:
* formula_30: the formula_31 boson&#x27;s creation operator.
* formula_32: the formula_31 boson&#x27;s annihilation operator.
Here formula_34.

These satisfy the commutation relations:
:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37
where formula_38 and formula_39 denotes the Kronecker delta.

These may be rewritten as: 
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42

====Examples====
1. For two different bosons (formula_43) we have
:formula_44
:formula_45

2. For three different bosons (formula_46) we have
:formula_47
Notice that since (by the commutation relations) formula_48 the order in which we write the annihilation operators does not matter.

:formula_49
:formula_50

===Bosonic operator functions===
Normal ordering of bosonic operator functions formula_51, with occupation number operator formula_52, can be accomplished using (falling) factorial powers formula_53 and Newton series instead of Taylor series: 
It is easy to show 
that factorial powers formula_54 are equal to normal-ordered (raw) powers formula_55 and are therefore normal ordered by construction,

: formula_56

such that the Newton series expansion 

: formula_57

of an operator function formula_58, with formula_59-th forward difference formula_60 at formula_61, is always normal ordered. Here, the eigenvalue equation formula_62 relates formula_63 and formula_64.

As a consequence, the normal-ordered Taylor series of an arbitrary function formula_51 is equal to the Newton series of an associated function formula_58, fulfilling

: formula_67

if the series coefficients of the Taylor series of formula_68, with continuous formula_69, match the coefficients of the Newton series of formula_70, with integer formula_64,

: formula_72

with formula_59-th partial derivative formula_74 at formula_75.
The functions formula_76 and formula_77 are related through the so-called normal-order transform formula_78 according to

: formula_79

which can be expressed in terms of the Mellin transform formula_80, see for details.

==Fermions==

Fermions are particles which satisfy Fermi–Dirac statistics. We will now examine the normal ordering of fermionic creation and annihilation operator products.

===Single fermions===
For a single fermion there are two operators of interest:

* formula_81: the fermion&#x27;s creation operator.
* formula_82: the fermion&#x27;s annihilation operator.

These satisfy the anticommutator relationships
:formula_83
:formula_84
:formula_85

where formula_86 denotes the anticommutator. These may be rewritten as

:formula_87
:formula_88
:formula_89

To define the normal ordering of a product of fermionic creation and annihilation operators we must take into account the number of interchanges between neighbouring operators. We get a minus sign for each such interchange.

====Examples====
1. We again start with the simplest cases:
:formula_90
This expression is already in normal order so nothing is changed. In the reverse case, we introduce a minus sign because we have to change the order of two operators:

:formula_91

These can be combined, along with the anticommutation relations, to show
:formula_92
or
:formula_93

This equation, which is in the same form as the bosonic case above, is used in defining the contractions used in Wick&#x27;s theorem.

2. The normal order of any more complicated cases gives zero because there will be at least one creation or annihilation operator appearing twice. For example:
:formula_94

===Multiple fermions===
For formula_28 different fermions there are formula_29 operators:
* formula_97: the formula_31 fermion&#x27;s creation operator.
* formula_99: the formula_31 fermion&#x27;s annihilation operator.
Here formula_34.

These satisfy the anti-commutation relations:
:formula_102
:formula_103
:formula_104
where formula_38 and formula_39 denotes the Kronecker delta.

These may be rewritten as:
:formula_107
:formula_108
:formula_109

When calculating the normal order of products of fermion operators we must take into account the number of interchanges of neighbouring operators required to rearrange the expression. It is as if we pretend the creation and annihilation operators anticommute and then we reorder the expression to ensure the creation operators are on the left and the annihilation operators are on the right - all the time taking account of the anticommutation relations.

====Examples====
1. For two different fermions (formula_43) we have
:formula_111
Here the expression is already normal ordered so nothing changes.

:formula_112
Here we introduce a minus sign because we have interchanged the order of two operators.

:formula_113
Note that the order in which we write the operators here, unlike in the bosonic case, &quot;does matter&quot;.

2. For three different fermions (formula_46) we have
:formula_115
Notice that since (by the anticommutation relations) formula_116 the order in which we write the operators &quot;does matter&quot; in this case.

Similarly we have
:formula_117
:formula_118

== Uses in quantum field theory==

The vacuum expectation value of a normal ordered product of creation and annihilation operators is zero. This is because, denoting the vacuum state by formula_119, the creation and annihilation operators satisfy
:formula_120
(here formula_121 and formula_122 are creation and annihilation operators (either bosonic or fermionic)).

Let formula_1 denote a non-empty product of creation and annihilation operators. Although this may satisfy
:formula_124
we have
:formula_125

Normal ordered operators are particularly useful when defining a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian of a theory is in normal order then the ground state energy will be zero:
formula_126.

===Free fields===
With two free fields φ and χ,

:formula_127

where formula_119 is again the vacuum state. Each of the two terms on the right hand side typically blows up in the limit as y approaches x but the difference between them has a well-defined limit. This allows us to define :φ(x)χ(x):.

===Wick&#x27;s theorem===
Wick&#x27;s theorem states the relationship between the time ordered product of formula_64 fields and a sum of 
normal ordered products. This may be expressed for formula_64 even as

:formula_131

where the summation is over all the distinct ways in which one may pair up fields. The result for formula_64 odd looks the same
except for the last line which reads

:formula_133

This theorem provides a simple method for computing vacuum expectation values of time ordered products of operators and was the motivation behind the introduction of normal ordering.

==Alternative definitions==

The most general definition of normal ordering involves splitting all quantum fields into two parts (for example see Evans and Steer 1996)
formula_134. 
In a product of fields, the fields are split into the two parts and the formula_135 parts are moved so as to be always to the left of all the formula_136 parts. In the usual case considered in the rest of the article, the formula_135 contains only creation operators, while the formula_136 contains only annihilation operators. As this is a mathematical identity, one can split fields in any way one likes. However, for this to be a useful procedure one demands that the normal ordered product of &quot;any&quot; combination of fields has zero expectation value

:formula_139

It is also important for practical calculations that all the commutators (anti-commutator for fermionic fields) of all formula_140 and formula_141 are all c-numbers. These two properties means that we can apply Wick&#x27;s theorem in the usual way, turning expectation values of time-ordered products of fields into products of c-number pairs, the contractions. In this generalised setting, the contraction is defined to be the difference between the time-ordered product and the normal ordered product of a pair of fields.

The simplest example is found in the context of thermal quantum field theory (Evans and Steer 1996). In this case the expectation values of interest are statistical ensembles, traces over all states weighted by formula_142. For instance, for a single bosonic quantum harmonic oscillator we have that the thermal expectation value of the number operator is simply the Bose–Einstein distribution

:formula_143

So here the number operator formula_12 is normal ordered in the usual sense used in the rest of the article yet its thermal expectation values are non-zero. Applying Wick&#x27;s theorem and doing calculation with the usual normal ordering in this thermal context is possible but computationally impractical. The solution is to define a different ordering, such that the formula_140 and formula_141 are &quot;linear combinations&quot; of the original annihilation and creations operators. The combinations are chosen to ensure that the thermal expectation values of normal ordered products are always zero so the split chosen will depend on the temperature.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Norton Schofield, VC (29 January 1865 – 10 October 1931) was an English British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Schofield was commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 15 February 1884, and promoted to captain on 1 February 1893. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War he was posted to South Africa.

===Details===
Schofield was 34 years old, and a captain in the Royal Field Artillery during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 15 December 1899, at the Battle of Colenso, South Africa, Captain Schofield with several others tried to save the guns of the 14th and 66th Batteries, Royal Field Artillery, when the detachments serving the guns had all become casualties or been driven from their guns by infantry fire at close range. Captain Schofield went out with two other officers (Walter Congreve and Frederick Roberts) and a corporal (George Nurse) when the first attempt was made to extricate the guns and helped in withdrawing the two that were saved. Schofield was initially awarded the Distinguished Service Order, but this was cancelled when he was subsequently upgraded to the VC, his citation reads:

Schofield received the medal from King Edward VII during an investiture at St. James&#x27;s Palace on 29 October 1901.

He was promoted to major on 13 February 1900, and appointed Aide-de-camp to Sir Redvers Buller, General Officer Commanding the Aldershot district. He retired from the Army in December 1905.

==Later life==

During the First World War Schofield rejoined the Army and served in a number of staff positions. He retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. 

He died on 10 October 1931 and is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery.

<text>Mark Scholefield, VC (16 April 1828 – 15 February 1858) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Royal Navy career==
Scholefield was 26 years old, and a seaman in the Royal Navy, serving in the Naval Brigade, during the Crimean War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 5 November 1854 at the Battle of Inkerman, Crimea, the Right Lancaster Battery was attacked and many of the soldiers were wounded. Seaman Scholefield with two other seamen (James Gorman and Thomas Reeves) and two others who were killed during the action, mounted the defense work banquette and, under withering attack from the enemy, kept up a rapid, repulsing fire. The muskets were re-loaded for them by the wounded soldiers under the parapet and eventually the enemy fell back and gave no more trouble.

Scholefield later achieved the rank of quartermaster. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Major Andrew Scott VC (22 August 1840 – 5 September 1882) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Scott was 36 years old, and a captain in the Bengal Staff Corps, British Indian Army during the Balochistan Campaign when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 26 July 1877 at Quetta, British India, Captain Scott was on duty at the regimental parade ground in the evening when he heard that British officers were being killed and immediately rushed to the rescue. He found one lieutenant cut down and another hard pressed and wounded but being protected by a sepoy. Captain Scott bayoneted two of the assailants and closed with a third, who fell with him to the ground and was killed by the sepoys of the regiment. This action saved the life of the wounded lieutenant.

He was killed in action at Srinagar, Kashmir, on 5 September 1882.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of major.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Robert George Scott, VC, DSO (22 April 1857 – 3 October 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early military career==
Scott was born on 22 April 1857 at Whittlesey, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. He was the son of Fleet-Surgeon Robert Charles Scott (RN) and Mary Elizabeth Scott, and entered Epsom College in 1870 and joined Granville House. He was an active member of the College Corps. After leaving College in 1871 he went on to join the Cape Mountain Riflemen in 1876. He served in the Frontier Wars of 1877 and the Zulu War of 1878–9.

==Details of Victoria Cross==
Scott was 21 years old, and a sergeant in the Cape Mounted Riflemen, Cape Colonial Forces during the Morosi&#x27;s Mountain 1879 Campaign when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

:On 8 April 1879 during an attack on Morosi&#x27;s Mountain, South Africa, Sergeant Scott volunteered to throw time-fuse shells as hand grenades over a wall of stone barricades from behind which the enemy were bringing heavy fire to bear on the Colonial troops. Sergeant Scott made his men take cover in case the shells burst prematurely before making two attempts to throw shells over it. At the second attempt the shell exploded almost in his hands blowing his right hand to pieces and wounding him severely in the leg.

==Later career==
Scott later served in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where he was in command of the Scott&#x27;s Railway Guards, attached to the Kimberley Light Horse. The Railway Guards did work on the Orange River – Kimberley line, and was engaged by the enemy several times during the war. Following the end of hostilities, Scott left Cape Town for England in June 1902. He later served in the First World War. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

<doc id="1193562" wikidata="Q7060123" url="?curid=1193562" title="Northwest Missouri State University">
<text>Northwest Missouri State University (NW Missouri) is a public university in Maryville, Missouri, United States. It has an enrollment of 9,152 students. Founded in 1905 as a teachers college, its campus is based on the design for Forest Park at the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair and is the official Missouri State Arboretum. The school is governed by a state-appointed Board of Regents and headed by President Lance Tatum.

The Northwest Bearcats compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Division II) and Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports.

==History==

===Founding===

In 1905, the Missouri Legislature created five districts in the state to establish normal schools, comprising a state teacher college network.

Maryville won the competition for the Northwest district with an offer to donate (on coincidentally the northwest corner of town) and $58,000 on the site of a Methodist Seminary. The other districts in the network were to be at Kirksville (Northeast – now Truman State), Cape Girardeau (Southeast), Springfield (Southwest – now Missouri State), and Warrensburg (Central – now Central Missouri).

The original mission of the school, initially known as the Fifth District Normal School, was to teach elementary school teachers. Classes began on June 13, 1906, with a lab school teaching Maryville&#x27;s children (that was eventually named the Horace Mann school) in kindergarten through third grade. The school was later expanded to a full-fledged high school before dropping back to its current configuration of kindergarten through sixth grade.
In 1919 the school was renamed Northwest Missouri State Teacher&#x27;s College, and with that came the ability to grant baccalaureate degrees. In 1949 the name was shrunk to Northwest Missouri State College by the Board of Regents.

===World War II===
During World War II, Northwest Missouri State University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

===Rivalry with Missouri Western===
In 1969, Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes pushed for switching St. Joseph Junior College from a two-year school into a four-year state college, which became Missouri Western State University. At approximately the same time, authorities decided against a plan to continue routing Interstate 29 north of St. Joseph alongside U.S. Route 71 through Maryville and on to Clarinda, Iowa, instead picking a route to the Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area along the sparsely-populated Missouri River bottoms.

Opening a new four-year state school within of Maryville (along with a delay in widening U.S. Route 71 to Maryville) was perceived in Maryville as an attempt to kill the school and the town with which it is intertwined. Those fears came to the forefront in 1988 when Shalia Aery, commissioner of higher education under Governor John Ashcroft, announced a plan to close the school. The plan was ultimately withdrawn.

===Northwest Missouri State University===
On August 14, 1972, Northwest was elevated to university status so that it could offer master&#x27;s degrees. Its name changed to Northwest Missouri State University.

The university currently holds four Missouri Quality Awards, granted in 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2008. Northwest is the only educational institution to receive multiple Missouri Quality Awards.
In 1987, Northwest unveiled its Electronic Campus Program, the first such program among public U.S. colleges.

===Missouri State Arboretum===
The campus design was inspired by the Forest Park design for the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, which evolved into the campus for Washington University in St. Louis. In 1993 the state legislature designated Northwest the official Missouri State Arboretum.

===Presidents===
* Frank Deerwester (1906–1907)
* Homer Martien Cook (1907–1909)
* Henry Kirby Taylor (1909–1913)
* Ira Richardson (1913–1921)
* Uel W. Lamkin (1921–1945)
* J.W. Jones (1945–1964)
* Robert P. Foster (1964–1977)
* B.D. Owens (1977–1984)
* Dean L. Hubbard (1984–2009)
* John Jasinski (2009–2022)
* Clarence Green (interim, 2022-2023)
* Lance Tatum (2023-Present)

== Administration building ==
===Design===
The defining landmark of the campus is the Administration Building, very similar to Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis. Brookings Hall served as the Administration Building of the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. The master St. Louis design was created by Cope &amp; Stewardson, famed for designing schools throughout the country based on the Oxford University style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

The Collegiate Gothic structure with its central tower keep design evokes Tattershall Castle and lords over the campus with the motto, &quot;And the truth shall make you free,&quot; engraved in stone. Because of this design, the term &quot;Tower&quot; is used frequently throughout campus and is the name of the school yearbook. Work on the building began in 1906 and continued on and off until classes began in it on October 3, 1910. The architect of record for the Maryville building is John H. Felt. On March 15, 1919, a tornado ripped the roof off its auditorium and blew out most of its windows.

===1979 fire===
On July 24, 1979, a fire destroyed 60 percent of the building on the central and west wing as well as the north wing housing the auditorium and Little Theater. Many thought the building was going to be razed, However the east wing survived with relatively little damage.

A $13.8 million capital program repaired most of the building and made extensive changes to the campus layout. The building ceased to serve as classroom space, with the exception of 3rd floor, which houses the Family and Consumer Sciences Department. The theater and music departments moved out of the building to what is now the Ron Houston Center for the Performing Arts, located southeast of Bearcat Stadium. The north wing of the Administration Building was torn down and sealed, although the outline of the wing is still visible against the bricks on the north. The former Wells Library (now Wells Hall) was turned into a classroom area and home for the National Public Radio affiliate radio station KXCV-FM and the library was moved to its current location in the new B.D. Owens Library. All the academic files were burned and lost with no backups prior to the fire.

== Athletics ==
Northwest was a founding member of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association in 1912 and has remained in the conference ever since. From its founding until 1937 it competed in the Amateur Athletic Union. From 1937 to 1957 it competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In 1957 it joined NCAA Division II. Northwest has appeared in ten Division II football title games (winning six) since 1998. The men&#x27;s basketball team appeared in an AAU title game in 1930. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the Division II title for the 2016–17 season and 2018-19 season.

The Bearcats have won six NCAA Division II football national championships (1998, 1999, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2016) and finished four times as runner-up (2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008). The Northwest Bearcats cheerleading squad have won three (2010, 2012, and 2013) Universal Cheerleaders Association Division II National Champions. The Northwest Bearcat Men&#x27;s Basketball team has won four national championships (2017, 2019, 2021, 2022) in the span of five tournaments. With the 2016 football championship and the 2017 basketball championship, Northwest became the first Division II program to win titles in football and men’s basketball in the same school year. The titles were also the first by a Division I or II program since the Division I Florida Gators in 2006-07.

<text>Maaveerar Naal (Great Heroes&#x27; Day; &quot;Māvīrar Nāḷ&quot;) is a remembrance day observed by Sri Lankan Tamils to remember the deaths of militants who fought with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to achieve an independent Tamil homeland. It is held each year on 27 November, the date on which the first LTTE cadre, Lt. Shankar (Sathiyanathan alias Suresh), died in combat in 1982. Traditionally oil lamps are lit for the three days ending on 27 November and the Tamil Eelam flag is raised at ceremonies. The symbol for Maaveerar Naal is the &quot;Gloriosa superba&quot; which blooms during November.

==History==

The first Maaveerar Naal was held on 27 November 1989. The date was chosen as it was the anniversary of the first LTTE cadre to die in combat, Lt. Shankar (Sathiyanathan alias Suresh), who died on 27 November 1982. On 27 November 1989 around 600 LTTE cadres gathered secretly in the jungles near Nithikaikulam in Manal Aru, Mullaitivu District, to remember their fallen comrades who at that time numbered around 1,300. In his speech LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran told the gathering that if he ever betrayed Tamil Eelam they must kill him.

Following the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in 1990 the LTTE gained controlled of large areas of territory in the north and east of Sri Lanka. The LTTE started developing ways to commemorate its dead heroes. They built thuyilum illam (resting place) for their &quot;maaveerar&quot; (great heroes) in territory they controlled. In 1991 the week leading up to Maaveerar Naal was declared Great Heroes&#x27; Week. This resulted in Prabhakaran&#x27;s birthday, which falls on 26 November, being included in the commemorations. The celebration of Prabhakaran&#x27;s birthday began to overshadow the Maaveerar Naal commemorations to an extent that some even believed that Maaveerar Naal was a celebration of Prabhakaran&#x27;s birthday. This resulted in Prabhakaran banning any celebration of his birthday. Commemorations eventually started amongst the growing Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora.

Over the years the commemorations became more elaborate, involving meetings, religious rituals, processions and exhibitions with cut-outs, posters and handbills of the dead cadres being distributed widely. Every village and every school were expected commemorate their dead cadres. Families of the dead cadres would gather at thuyilum illam to mourn their dead relatives. The culmination of the commemorations was a great function at a special location at which the reclusive Prabhakaran gave a speech which started at 6.05pm, the precise time Lt. Shankar died. The highly anticipated speeches began to take on the form of an annual policy statement by the LTTE and were broadcast on LTTE affiliated radio and TV stations in LTTE controlled areas and abroad.

After the Sri Lankan military recaptured the Jaffna peninsula in 1995 they destroyed LTTE cemeteries, thuyilum illam, in the area including those at Chaadi, Ellangkulam, Kodikamam and Kopay. Following the start of the Norwegian mediated peace process in 2002 the LTTE started rebuilding their war cemeteries. Maaveerar Naal commemorations were allowed in government territory. In 2004 Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs were allowed to light oil lamps in front of the Parliament to commemorate Maaveerar Naal. However, after the peace process stalled the Sri Lankan military started imposing restrictions on &quot;Maaveerar Naal&quot; commemorations and destroying LTTE cemeteries.

=== Restrictions of celebrations ===
Following the end of the civil war in May 2009 the Sri Lankan government and its security forces have clamped down on any attempt at commemorating Maaveerar Naal and destroyed the remaining LTTE cemeteries. All Maaveerar Naal commemorations have been banned. Critics of the ban argue that the Sri Lankan government is denying the Tamil people the basic human right to mourn their dead. The ban on commemorations has been criticised by the TNA, the main political party representing Sri Lankan Tamils, who point out that the commemoration of the LTTE dead is banned but that of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna dead is allowed. The JVP waged two violent insurrections against the Sri Lankan government - in 1971 and 1987-89 - which resulted in the death of up to 70,000 people.

On 27 November 2012 an attempt by some University of Jaffna students to commemorate Maaveerar Naal by lighting oil lamps was broken by the Sri Lankan security forces who broke the lamps, threatened the students and pointing weapons at them. The following day students staged a peaceful protest against the actions of the security forces but they were met by riot police who attacked and beat the protesters, resulting in at least 20 students being injured and four arrested.

In 2016 the Government Minister Mano Ganesan claimed that Maaveerar Naal can be celebrated as it is a human right for people to celebrate their late loved ones but it was wrong to do it with a political motive. He cited that the marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) also celebrate il Maha Viru Samaruwa in the South to commemorate their dead. However due to the fact that the LTTE is still proscribed but JVP is no longer considered a terrorist organization the LTTE cannot be mentioned.

In 2020 according to Defence Secretary and retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne celebration would be allowed as long as they do not disrupt peace and avoid statements that instigate hatred among communities.

==Remembrance day==

Despite the security restrictions Tamils in Sri Lanka hold small events to commemorate Maaveerar Naal. Tamil politicians have started a tradition of planting trees on Maaveerar Naal.

In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a number of political parties, youth organisations, social movement groups etc. engage themselves in organising a number of events commemorating Maaveerar Naal across the state.

Amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora, where there are no restrictions on commemorating Maaveerar Naal, large public gatherings continue to be held. In cities such as Toronto, London, Paris, Oslo, New Jersey, and Sydney, thousands of supporters come to honour those who lost their lives fighting for Tamil Eelam. In November 2014 Canadian New Democratic Party MP Rathika Sitsabaiesan was criticised for comparing Maaveerar Naal with Remembrance Day, a holiday which commemorates soldiers from Commonwealth countries who died since the First World War during a speech in the House of Commons. However, in 2021, Brampton mayor Patrick Brown commemorated Maaveerar Naal on behalf of the city.

<text>The 1855 New Zealand general election was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s 2nd term. It was the second national election ever held in New Zealand, and the first one which elected a Parliament that had full authority to govern the colony.

==Background==
The first New Zealand elections had been held after the passage of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The 1st Parliament did not have the ability to appoint the executive branch (Cabinet) of the New Zealand government, however, and a major dispute arose between Parliament and the Governor. In the 2nd Parliament, Parliament gained the powers it sought — for this reason, some see the 1855 elections, not the 1853 elections, as the beginning of New Zealand democracy.

At the time of the 1855 elections, there were no political parties in New Zealand. As such, all candidates were independents. Governments were formed based on loose coalitions, with prospective Prime Ministers needing to seek support from enough individual MPs to command a majority. This means that nobody could truly be said to have &quot;won&quot; an election — a government usually rose or fell based on its ability to make deals with MPs, not on election results.

==The election==
In the 1855 elections, voting occurred on a different day for each individual seat. The first seat was elected on 26 October, and the final seat was elected on 28 December. An estimated 9,891 people were eligible to vote, although records are poor for some areas. The number of electoral districts was 24, with some districts electing multiple MPs. The total number of seats was 37. Some parts of the colony were not part of any district, and did not have representation in Parliament.

<text>The Hy-wire (Hydrogen drive-by-wire) is a concept car from General Motors originally introduced in January 2002. The car runs on hydrogen fuel cells and uses a drive-by-wire system, meaning that the car is controlled electronically. GM asked school children to name the car, and one of them suggested &quot;Hy-wire&quot;.

In 2003, General Motors stated that it was confident that it could produce a commercially viable model by 2010.

==Design ==
Due to hydrogen fuel cell drive system used by the Hy-wire, the conventional car layout has been revamped. Without the need for a conventional engine block and transmission system coupled to the steering column and pedals through mechanical linkage, the car&#x27;s power system and single electric motor are built into a flat skateboard configuration. This serves to lower the car&#x27;s center of gravity, but more importantly to standardize vehicle drive train systems. Because all propulsion and energy storage systems are housed in the skateboard, designers are free to arrange the passenger compartment however they see fit. This allows for highly flexible modular vehicle configurations such as a 4-door sedan, mini van, or even a small bus to be placed on the same drive system, with the only difference being the shape of the car&#x27;s upper body and the location of seats. The skateboard itself contains crumple zones similar to those in conventional automobiles.

===Driver interface ===
The car&#x27;s drive-by-wire system coupled with cameras instead of mirrors and multiple LCD displays for feedback to the driver theoretically allows the driver&#x27;s seat to be located anywhere; however, most current designs still favor the driver in front of or beside the other passengers for maximum visibility. The coupling of the controls to the drive system means neither the driver&#x27;s seat nor the steering and throttle controls must be fixed in place. For example, the 2003 concept model has a single control interface that can be operated from either the right or left front seats, and the 2004 concept design places the two front seats on a rotating platform which allows the driver and passenger seats to be swapped or the driver to sit in front of the passenger for greater flexibility.

===Powerplant===
The Hy-wire is powered by a fuel cell capable of producing 94 kilowatts of power continuously and up to 129 kilowatts for short periods. The fuel cell itself is supplied with hydrogen from 3 tanks of compressed hydrogen located in the chassis. With its three-phase electric motor the 1,814 kg (4,000 lb) vehicle has a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph).

<doc id="1193571" wikidata="Q7855753" url="?curid=1193571" title="Turn of the Tide (film)">
<text>Turn of the Tide is a 1935 British drama film directed by Norman Walker and starring John Garrick, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Wilfrid Lawson. It was the first feature film made by J. Arthur Rank. Lacking a distributor for his film, Rank set up his own distribution and production company which subsequently grew into his later empire.

The film contains many Whitby registered boats (WY) and contains much documentary-style footage of making and repairing lobster creels.

==Plot==
The film is set in the fictional Yorkshire fishing village of Bramblewick and relates the rivalry between two fishing families. It is filmed mainly around Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay (evidenced in the WY identity codes on the fishing boats).

The characters speak in the local Yorkshire accent and dialect. Rivalry between the lobster fishermen begins when one boat is fitted with a new diesel engine. Ropes are cut so the lobsters cannot be retrieved. The feuding comes to an end when a man from one family says he wants to marry a girl from the other family.

The work is based on the 1932 novel &quot;Three Fevers&quot; by Leo Walmsley.

==Cast==
* John Garrick as Marney Lunn 
* J. Fisher White as Isaac Fosdyck 
* Geraldine Fitzgerald as Ruth Fosdyck 
* Wilfrid Lawson as Luke Fosdyck 
* Moore Marriott as Tindal Fosdyck 
* Sam Livesey as Henry Lunn 
* Niall MacGinnis as John Lunn 
* Joan Maude as Amy Lunn 
* Derek Blomfield as Steve Lunn 
* Hilda Davies as Mrs. Lunn

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1935, Graham Greene remarked that the film was &quot;unpretentious and truthful&quot;, and &quot;one of the best English films [he] ha[d] yet seen&quot;. Rejecting contemporary critical comparison of the film to &quot;Man of Aran&quot;, Greene suggested that where &quot;Man of Aran&quot; had featured sentimentality, &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot;″s director &quot;Norman Walker is concerned with truth, [...] and the beauty his picture catches is that of exact statement&quot;.

Although the film was originally considered a box-office disappointment it was eventually voted the sixth best British movie of 1936.

&quot;Britmovie&quot; called it a &quot;refreshingly compassionate drama that benefits from being filmed on location at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay and Whitby&quot;.

<text>Francis Alexander Caron Scrimger, (February 10, 1880 – February 13, 1937), was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
Scrimger was born in Montreal, the son of the Reverend John Scrimger, Principal of The Presbyterian College, Montreal. He was educated at the High School of Montreal and McGill University, obtaining a BA in 1901 and an MD in 1905. He was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1912. His Attestation Paper for the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force states Scrimger was born 10th Feb 1881, however the 1881 Census of Canada lists Frank Scrimger as one year old in that year, hence the birth year of 1880 is correct.
==Victoria Cross==
During the Second Battle of Ypres on 25 April 1915 at Saint-Julien, Wieltje Salient, Belgium, Captain Scrimger, then serving as the medical officer of the 14th Battalion, Royal Montreal Regiment, was in charge of an advanced dressing station in a farmhouse near Wieltje on the St. Julien-Ypres Road. The advancing enemy were bombarding the area with an intense shelling. The German infantry were within sight. Scrimger directed the removal of the wounded under the heavy fire. Captain Scrimger and a badly wounded Captain Macdonald were the last men left at the station. Scrimger carried the wounded officer out of the farmhouse to the road. The bombardment of shell forced Scrimger to stop and place Macdonald on the road. Scrimger then protected him with his own body. During a lull in the gunfire Scrimger again carried Macdonald toward help. When he was unable to carry him any further, he remained with the wounded man until help could be obtained.

== Later life ==
After the war, Scrimger was appointed to the chair of Surgery at McGill and Chief Surgeon of the Royal Victoria Hospital. He died in Montreal in 1937. His only son, Captain Alexander Canon Scrimger, of the 29th Canadian Reconnaissance Regiment (South Alberta Regiment), Canadian Armoured Corps, was killed in action in Holland in 1944.

==Legacy==
In 1918, Mount Scrimger, a 9039-foot peak in the Canadian Rockies on the border between Alberta and British Columbia, was named after him. His medals are held at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa after being donated by his descendants in 2005.

<doc id="1193582" wikidata="Q1523538" url="?curid=1193582" title="Henry Kaiser (musician)">
<text>Henry Kaiser (born September 19, 1952) is an American guitarist and composer, known as an idiosyncratic soloist, a sideman, an ethnomusicologist, and a film score composer. Recording and performing prolifically in many styles of music, Kaiser is a fixture on the San Francisco Bay Area music scene. He is considered a member of the &quot;second generation&quot; of American free improvisers. He is married to Canadian artist Brandy Gale. He is the son of Henry J. Kaiser Jr. and the grandson of industrialist Henry J. Kaiser.

==Biography==
In 1977, Kaiser founded Metalanguage Records with Larry Ochs (Rova Saxophone Quartet) and Greg Goodman. In 1979 he recorded &quot;With Friends Like These&quot; with Fred Frith, a collaboration which continued over the next 20 years. In 1983 they recorded &quot;Who Needs Enemies&quot;, and in 1987 the compilation album &quot;With Enemies Like These, Who Needs Friend&quot;s? They joined with fellow experimental musicians John French, and English folk-rocker Richard Thompson to form French Frith Kaiser Thompson for two eclectic albums, &quot;Live, Love, Larf &amp; Loaf&quot; (1987) and &quot;Invisible Means&quot; (1990). In 1999 Frith and Kaiser released &quot;Friends &amp; Enemies&quot;, a compilation of their two Metalanguage albums along with additional material from 1984 and 1999.

In 1991, Kaiser went to Madagascar with guitarist David Lindley. They recorded roots music with Malagasy musicians and discovered music that, he says, &quot;changed us radically and permanently&quot;. Three volumes of this music were released by Shanachie under the title &quot;A World Out of Time&quot;. In 1994 he made a similar trip to Norway, again with Lindley, recording music that was released as &quot;Sweet Sunny North&quot; (2 volumes, 1994 and 1996).

Since 1998, Kaiser has been collaborating with trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith in the &quot;Yo Miles!&quot; project, releasing a series of tributes to Miles Davis&#x27;s 1970s electric music. This shifting aggregation has included musicians from the worlds of rock (guitarists Nels Cline, Mike Keneally and Chris Muir, drummer Steve Smith), jazz (saxophonists Greg Osby and John Tchicai), avant-garde (keyboardist John Medeski, guitarist Elliott Sharp), and Indian classical music (tabla player Zakir Hussain).

Kaiser has appeared on more than 300 albums and scored dozens of TV shows and films, including Werner Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot; (2007). He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on the &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; tribute to Stephen Foster.

In 2001, Kaiser spent two and a half months in Antarctica on a National Science Foundation Antarctic Artists and Writers Program grant. He has subsequently returned for nine more visits to work as a research diver. His underwater camera work was featured in two Herzog films, &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (2005) and &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot; (2007), which he also produced, and for which he and Lindley composed the score. Kaiser served as music producer for Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Grizzly Man&quot; (2005). He was nominated for an Academy Award for his work as a producer on &quot;Encounters at the End of the World&quot;.

==Instruments and effects==
Kaiser &quot;has amassed an immense collection of guitars, amplifiers, and effect pedals&quot; to achieve &quot;sonic diversity&quot;. A favorite of his is a Klein electric with Alembic pickups (his favorites), which he uses when traveling. He owns a Dumble handmade amplifier. He has been looping since at least 1984 (&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;), initially with an MXR digital delay, and later with Lexicon equipment—he sets modulation rates to &quot;either heart or breathing rate, because those are natural healing rhythm rates&quot;. He often uses two delays to provide three different voices. He is also an avid user of a large number of effects pedals including the Hall &amp; Collins Echo unit and a range of fuzzes.

Kaiser has listed his essential effects as the Old World 1960 Compressor, Barber Tone Press, Origin Effects Slide Rig, Tech 21 Comptortion, Burns Buzzaround Clones, Tanabe Zenkudo or Dumkudo, Crazy Tube Circuits Starlight, Eventide Pitchfactor, Eventide Eclipse Harmonizer, TC Flashback, Red Panda Particle, and Neunaber Wet Reverb.

<text>Sisterson! was a short-run comic book which ran for three or four issues around 1990 and was circulated among London comic shops. &quot;Sisterson!&quot; was a &quot;jam comic&quot;, i.e., a collection of comic strips each of which was an unplanned collaborative effort, with one creator drawing the first panel and then passing it on to another to be continued, usually resulting in a comic strip far more strange and unpredictable than any one artist would be likely to devise. Essentially, the comic was used as a method to teach sequential thinking and for studying the approach of other artists and creators.

Notable creators who contributed to &quot;Sisterson&quot; included Nick Abadzis, John McCrea, D&#x27;Israeli, Hunt Emerson, Woodrow Phoenix, 
Darryl Cunningham, Charlie Adlard, Roger Langridge, and Simon Fraser.

== History == 
&quot;Jam comics&quot; have many other origins: &quot;Sisterson&quot; was named after a particular example that took place in the Humour Comic Strip class at the London Cartoon Centre (LCC), a series of comics classes that took place at various venues in West London in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Taking an idea from then-student/future LCC course director Steve Marchant, one of the attendees, Dennis Sisterson, initiated a jam comic, and it became a regular feature of the class. Tutor Donald Rooum dubbed it &quot;The Sisterson Game&quot; and the name stuck; years later it re-emerged as a postal game. Among the participants at the original London Cartoon Centre class were comic artist/teacher Steve Marchant and writer Andrew Pilcher.

== Rules ==
Rules were developed over the years by various players, eventually distilling into this form: &quot;Sisterson&quot; is a game for three or more people. A cartoonist cannot draw a panel if one of his or her previous drawings appears within the two prior panels. Participants should follow the story through sequentially, panel by panel; they can not skip a panel or two because they cannot think what should go next. No &quot;unnecessary&quot; sex or violence.

One variety played at the LCC involved placing a panel at any unused point in the strip, not necessarily the panel following the one previously drawn, but this made things just a bit too difficult.

<text>Ernest Seaman VC, MM (16 August 1893 – 29 September 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 29 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive of the First World War.

==Early life==
Ernest Seaman was born on 16 August 1893, in the village of Heigham, near Norwich, to Henry and Sarah Seaman, who already had a daughter. His father died while Seaman was still a child but his mother was later remarried, to a publican. The family ran an inn near Scole. Educated at Scole Primary School, on finishing his schooling Seaman moved to Trimley to live with an aunt and work as a page boy in the Grand Hotel in Felixstowe. Emigrated to Canada in 1912.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Seaman returned to the United Kingdom and tried to enlist in the British Army. He was initially rejected, but he subsequently enlisted at Le Havre. However, he was classified as unfit for active frontline service and was posted to the catering division of the Army Service Corps in late 1915. As the war progressed, the high casualty rates in the British Expeditionary Force saw standards for frontline service lowered and Seaman was transferred to an infantry unit, the 2nd Battalion of The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. Serving in the Ypres salient, he was soon awarded the Military Medal (MM) for attending, while under fire, to fellow soldiers who had been wounded. The recommendation for his MM was made by his company commander.
As part of the 36th (Ulster) Division, Seaman&#x27;s battalion was engaged in the Fifth Battle of Ypres, a battle of the Hundred Days Offensive, on 29 September 1918. It was tasked with the capture of Terhand. After initial good progress, the battalion was held up by German machine-gun posts. Seaman, a lance corporal operating a Lewis gun, played a key role in getting the advance restarted although he was killed in the process. Afterwards, his bravery was recognised with a posthumous award of the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read:
Seaman has no known grave but is commemorated at the Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing near Ypres, the memorial to the 36th Division at the Ulster Tower near Thiepval on the Somme, Felixstowe War Memorial in Suffolk, and the Scole War Memorial in Norfolk. King George V presented Seaman&#x27;s VC to his mother in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 13 February 1919.

Seaman is the subject of a short story entitled &quot;Unfit for Active Service&quot; by Ruth Dugdall. The story was published in 2018 as part of an anthology to commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One. Entitled &quot;The Many Faces of 1918&quot;, the anthology is a collection of original stories from across Europe, chosen by the embassies of those countries. Unfit for Active Service was chosen by John Marshall, the British Ambassador to Luxembourg.

==Medal==
Seaman&#x27;s VC is held at the museum of the successor to the Army Service Corps, The Royal Logistic Corps. As well as the MM, he was also entitled to several campaign medals, including the 1914–1915 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal.
