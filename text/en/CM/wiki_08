<text>William Henry Harrison Seeley, VC (May 1, 1840 – October 1, 1914) was an American who fought with the British Royal Navy during the Taiping Rebellion, the Bombardment of Kagoshima and the Shimonoseki Campaign and was a recipient of the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Shimonoseki Campaign, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first American recipient of the Victoria Cross, the 28th member of the Royal Navy to earn the award and was, at the time, the only foreigner to have received it.

== Early life ==
Seeley was born on May 1, 1840, in Topsham, Maine, to Dayton A. Seeley and Lucy J. Seeley (maiden name Johnston). He became a dock labourer in the 1850s. A family squabble led to him running away at the age of 14, joining the complement of a British merchant ship – the &quot;Salem&quot; – which was docked in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time. When Seeley was asked how he came to join the Royal Navy during an interview with &quot;The Brunswick Record&quot; in 1904, he said;

During a voyage aboard the &quot;Salem&quot; he saved the ship&#x27;s carpenter, Bill Sharp, from drowning by diving overboard after him. He spoke of the incident during the interview, saying; &quot;You see, Bill was tinkering up the bow, and was washed overboard. He wasn&#x27;t much on swimming so I jumped in and they pulled us both out. That&#x27;s all.&quot;

== Royal Navy service ==
Seeley, then approximately 22, joined the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman on board the HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; in 1862, which was then operating under the East Indies and China Station. The &quot;Euryalus&quot; was a fourth-rate wooden-hulled screw frigate. The &quot;Euryalus&quot; had landed in Hong Kong that year to contribute sailors to the 570-strong naval brigade assisting the Great Qing&#x27;s Imperial Army during the Taiping Rebellion; this brigade often supported the Ever Victorious Army, commanded at the time by Charles George Gordon.

During the interview with &quot;The Brunswick Record&quot;, Seeley said of serving under Gordon &quot;I served in China under Chinese Gordon, and was with him at Ming Poo, when he drove Li Huang Chang out of camp at the point of a pistol. He was bound to be boss, was the general, and he wouldn&#x27;t stand for the pig-tailed heathen coming round to tell him how to run things.&quot;

==Background==

 Tensions were rising in Japan prior to 1863, with several incidents being perpetrated against foreigners relating to the sonnō jōi faction, a faction that wished to isolate Japan again. Some of these incidents included the attack on the British consulate in Tōzen-ji, Edo by warriors from the Mito Domain in July 1861, the killing of one and wounding of two other British merchants in September that year by warriors from the Satsuma Domain and the attack and burning of another British consulate that was under construction at the time in Shinagawa, Edo in January 1863 by warriors from the Chōshū Clan. 

Due to these incidents, the Emperor Kōmei issued the order to expel barbarians, an imperial edict which aimed to isolate Japan again. The Shōgun at the time, Tokugawa Iemochi, went to Kyoto to request an audience with the Emperor. The result of this audience was that the order to expel would be put into practice two months later on June 25 that year. Many of the Chōshū, including their &quot;daimyo&quot; Mōri Takachika, supported this, declaring that after the deadline all foreign ships traversing the Straits of Shimonoseki were to be attacked. These straits separate the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū, providing a passage between the Seto Inland Sea and the Sea of Japan. Following the deadline, several western ships were attacked, including a US merchant steamer, a French aviso and a 16-gun Dutch warship, resulting in the deaths of four Dutch sailors and the wounding of five Dutch and four French sailors.

The US and French navies retaliated, with the frigate USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; sailing into the straits on July 16 under the sanction of Minister Robert H. Pruyn, sinking two ships and inflicted some 40 casualties, suffering severe damage in the process. On July 20, Admiral Benjamin Jaurès sailed into the straits with his flagship, the screw frigate &quot;Sémiramis&quot;, and the aviso &quot;Tancrède&quot;. 250 marines came ashore and occupied the shore batteries with little resistance, tossing most of the guns and supplies left by the rebels into the sea; they occupied the emplacements until July 24, destroying nearby military camps and burning a local village. Despite the retaliatory attacks, the US steamer &quot;Monitor&quot; was attacked while awaiting refuelling from a nearby town later in July.

Diplomatic channels between all involved countries opened in attempts to reopen the straits, with the British Minister to Japan, Sir Rutherford Alcock, Dutch Minister Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek and Pruyn discussing the feasibility of a joint strike against Takachika and his forces. Takachika requested additional time to respond to the treaty partners&#x27; demands, which was deemed to be unacceptable.

== The Bombardment of Shimonoseki ==
On August 17, 1864, a squadron consisting of nine British (including the &quot;Euryalus&quot;), four Dutch (including the &quot;Medusa&quot;, the 16-gun warship that was attacked) and three French warships, crewed by 3,000 sailors and a further 2,000 mainly British soldiers, all under the command of Admiral Sir Augustus Leopold Kuper of the Royal Navy, steamed out of Yokohama to open the straits. Kuper took command from the deck of the &quot;Euryalus&quot;.

The only US warship in the area at the time was the sail-powered sloop-of-war USS &quot;Jamestown&quot;, which could not overcome the strong currents of the straits and thus could not join the expedition. As such, Minister Pruyn and then Captain Cicero Price chartered the steamer &quot;Ta-Kiang&quot; from Walsh, Hall and Company. Under the terms of the agreement, she was &quot;to carry a landing party, and in every way to assist in the common object, but not to be under fire of the forts.&quot; The &quot;Ta-Kiang&quot; would later assist the squadron by towing boats and receiving the wounded. The full squadron of 17 ships had 388 guns and 7,542 men between them.

The battle took place between September 5–6, 1864, with the bombardment taking place on September 5. Aimed at taking out the shore batteries, the fleet utilised their guns&#x27; range advantage, battering the shore batteries and fortifications. The bombardment lasted for approximately one and a half hours. Despite the bombardment, fire from the shores recommenced at approximately six o&#x27;clock the next morning. The allied fleet once again silenced the guns and prepared to begin landing soldiers on the coast in order to silence the batteries and destroy their ammunition stores. In the afternoon a landing party consisting of 1,350 British, 350 French, and 200 Dutch soldiers landed on the shore and began their assault. Seeley and his shipmates were assigned to the 3rd Company.

Seeley volunteered to reconnoitre the enemy&#x27;s positions, locating a stockade manned by the enemy. He was discovered by them, and, in the ensuing pursuit, he received an injury to his right arm by grape shot. Despite this injury, he would deliver a coherent report to his company commander, Second Lieutenant Frederick Edwards, and join his fellow soldiers in the assault on the stockade.

Seeing the British advance the rebels fell back to the stockade, which was manned by 300 men, seven light guns and protected by an palisade. At the head of the assault was the colour party. One of the colour sergeants was mortally wounded, while the second, petty officer Thomas Pride, was hit in the left side of his chest by a musket ball. When they returned to the rear, it was discovered that the colour that Duncan Gordon Boyes had carried was &quot;six times pierced by musket balls.&quot;

Captain J. H. J. Alexander was wounded in the ankle by a musket ball, falling to the ground. Upon seeing this, Seeley said he immediately rushed to get him out of range, walking about a quarter of a mile with Alexander on his back. Seeley later said of the incident;

== Aftermath and Victoria Crosses ==
&quot;The London Gazette&quot; would later report on dispatches received from Kuper, stating &quot;Since the conclusion of these operations I have satisfied myself, by personal examination, of the entire Straits, that no batteries remain in existence on the territory of the Prince of Choshiu, and thus the passage of the Straits may be considered cleared of all obstructions.&quot;

Also in these dispatches, Captain J. H. J. Alexander would report that &quot;2nd. Lieutenant Frederick Edwards, commanding the third company, has called my attention to the intelligence and daring exhibited by William Seeley, ordinary seaman, in ascertaining the enemy&#x27;s position, and afterwards, when wounded in the arm in the advance, continued to retain his position in the front.&quot;

Seeley would be taken to Portsmouth to recover from his injuries. Pride, Boyes and Seeley would all be awarded the Victoria Cross for their courageous actions during the battle. They were presented the awards under much fanfare on September 22, 1865, at Southsea by Admiral Michael Seymour. Seeley lost his Victoria Cross twice between then and 1889.

On the first occasion he had it stolen from him &quot;in the Lord Howe Tavern, London, soon after I quit the British service in &#x27;66, and was finding that the cross weren&#x27;t any help for getting a feller another berth. I hunted for it, but there was never a trace of it for three months. Then it was sent to Whitehall anonymous.&quot;

On the second occasion he had it stolen when he returned to Boston. It was discovered in a gutter by Mr. J. W. Grady, who at that time was just a young boy. At the time he had no idea what it was or what the significance of it was. He thought nothing of it for several years before learning what it was; as the owner could not be found, he kept hold of it despite several offers of $100 to buy it as he believed he had no right to sell it. Some 15 years after he found it, a friend of his showed him a copy of the &quot;Boston Evening News&quot; dated January 23 that had a page story about Seeley, titled &quot;Only American Citizen to Win Victoria Cross&quot;.

As the story had Seeley&#x27;s name in it, he sent a message to Seeley at once to tell him how he found his Victoria Cross. During the correspondence between them, Seeley described the cross in great detail. Satisfied he had found the rightful owner, Grady sent it back to Seeley. One of Seeley&#x27;s messages was printed in the paper, which read;

During his interview with &quot;The Brunswick Record&quot;, Seeley said of the Victoria Cross;

== Later life and death ==
Seeley later returned to Massachusetts, marrying Mary E. Moore on October 1, 1900, with whom he ran a small farm on the line between Sharon and Stoughton until his wife&#x27;s death at the farm. He then moved in with his son, George G. Seeley, in Dedham, Massachusetts. He would die here aged 74 on Thursday October 1, 1914. He was buried on October 4 that same year in Evergreen Cemetery, Stoughton, two burial plots behind that of his sister, Bessie. As Seeley&#x27;s name was not placed on his grave following his burial, the grave site went unrecognised until 2009 when funds were raised for the instalment of a memorial plaque.

His granddaughter was the last keeper of his Victoria Cross, with it going missing in 1943.

<text>The AeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye is a small reconnaissance miniature UAV developed by the Naval Research Laboratory and the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory for use by the United States Marine Corps. It was designed to provide reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) for the USMC company, platoon, and squad levels. It can provide this to around in its vicinity.

==Design and development==

It is a tailless design with a rectangular wing and twin props. It is designed to fit into a backpack, with a weight of and a span of . It can be launched by hand or using a store-bought bungee cord. It also uses a break-apart system to increase durability—parts of the plane break apart instead of shattering and can be reattached later or replaced with new parts. It has a GPS-INS-based waypoint navigation system.

The operator monitors Dragon Eye operation through &quot;video goggles&quot; connected to a laptop computer. The control system weighs about .

The Dragon Eye aircraft is used primarily for scouting urban areas, and is especially useful in urban assaults. Its camera, when used with a trained Marine, can be used to spot enemies without alerting them to the UAV&#x27;s presence.

The production contract for Dragon Eye was awarded to AeroVironment in 2003, and over 1000 aircraft were built before the Marines switched over to another UCAV of AeroVironment (RQ-11 Raven B) for the remainder of the Dragon Eye production contract.

The Dragon Eye has been used in Iraq, post-invasion, from 2003–present.

<doc id="1193609" wikidata="Q236163" url="?curid=1193609" title="Kielce pogrom">
<text>The Kielce pogrom was an outbreak of violence toward the Jewish community centre&#x27;s gathering of refugees in the city of Kielce, Poland, on 4 July 1946 by Polish soldiers, police officers, and civilians during which 42 Jews were killed and more than 40 were wounded. Polish courts later sentenced nine of the attackers to death in connection with the crimes.

As the deadliest pogrom against Polish Jews after the Second World War, the incident was a significant point in the post-war history of Jews in Poland. It took place only a year after the end of the Second World War and the Holocaust, shocking Jews in Poland, non-Jewish Poles, and the international community. It has been recognized as a symptom of the precarious condition of Eastern European Jewish communities in the aftermath of the Holocaust and as a catalyst for the flight from Poland of most remaining Polish Jews who had survived the war.

==Background==
Relations between Jewish and non-Jewish Poles were already strained before the war, as antisemitic propaganda was spread by members of parliament and clergy. According to Alina Skibińska and Joanna Tokarska-Bakir, during the 1930s &quot;the relations between the communities ... began to increasingly resemble apartheid.&quot;

During the German occupation of Poland, Kielce and the villages around it were completely ethnically cleansed by the Nazis of its pre-war Jewish community, most of whom perished in The Holocaust. By the summer of 1946, some 200 Jews, many of them former residents of Kielce, had returned from the Nazi concentration camps or refuge in the Soviet Union. About 150–160 of them were quartered in a single building administered by the Jewish Committee of Kielce Voivodeship at Planty, a small street in the centre of the town.

On 1 July 1946, an eight-year-old non-Jewish Polish boy, Henryk Błaszczyk, was reported missing by his father Walenty Błaszczyk. According to the father, upon his return two days later the boy claimed he had been kidnapped by an unknown man, allegedly a Jew or a gypsy. Two days later, the boy, his father and the neighbour went to a local Citizens&#x27; Militia (state police) station. While passing the &quot;Jewish house&quot; at 7 Planty Street, Henryk pointed at a man nearby who, he said, had allegedly imprisoned him in the house&#x27;s cellar. At the police station, Henryk repeated his story that he had been kidnapped and specified the Jews and their house as involved in his disappearance. A Civic Militia patrol of more than a dozen men was then dispatched on foot by the station commander Edmund Zagórski to search the house at 7 Planty Street for the place where Henryk had allegedly been kept.

Although the kidnapping claim was quickly withdrawn, Henryk Błaszczyk remained publicly silent about the events until 1998, when, in an interview to a Polish journalist he admitted he was never kidnapped but was living with an &quot;unknown family&quot; in a nearby village and was treated well. He perceived his disappearance as happening with his father&#x27;s awareness and concerted by the communist security service. After returning home he was categorically commanded by his father not to discuss anything that happened and reaffirm only the story of &quot;Jewish abduction&quot; if ever asked. He was threatened to keep quiet long after 1946, which he did out of fear until the end of communist rule in Poland.

Civic Militia publicised the rumours of the kidnapping and further announced that they were planning to search for the bodies of non-Jewish Polish children supposedly ritually murdered and kept in the house, resulting in the gathering of civilian spectators. A confrontation ensued between the militia forces and officers of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland (UBP), which had been called in on the suspicion that the incident was a Jewish &quot;provocation&quot; to stir up unrest.

During the morning, the case came to the attention of other local state and military organs, including the Polish People&#x27;s Army (LWP – communist controlled regular army), the Internal Security Corps (KBW, interior ministry paramilitary), and the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (GZI WP, military intelligence and counterintelligence). About 100 soldiers and five officers were dispatched to the location at about 10 am. The soldiers were unfamiliar with the circumstances, but soon picked up rumors from the people in the street, who at this time commenced pelting the building with stones.

==Outbreak of violence==
The Civic Militia and soldiers then forcibly broke into the building only to discover that it did not contain any abducted children as claimed. The inhabitants of the house, who had proper permits to bear arms for self defence, were ordered to surrender their weaponry and give up valuables. Someone (unclear who) started firing a weapon. Civic Militia and the KBW opened fire, killing and wounding a number of people in the building. In response, shots were fired from the Jewish side killing two or three non-Jewish Poles, including a Civic Militia officer. The head of the local Jewish Committee, Dr , was fatally wounded by a GZI WP officer while telephoning the Kielce office of Public Security for help. A number of local priests attempted to enter the building but were stopped by militia officers, who vowed to control the situation.

Following the initial murders inside the building, numerous Jews were driven outdoors by soldiers and later attacked with stones and clubs by civilians who crowded surrounding streets. By noon, the arrival of a large group of estimated about 600 to 1,000 workers from Ludwików steel mill, led by activists of Poland&#x27;s ruling Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR, communist party), opened the next stage of the pogrom. Approximately 20 Jews were battered to death by the workers armed with iron rods and clubs. Some of the workers were members of the ORMO (volunteer reserve militia) and at least one possessed a handgun. Neither the military or security heads, including a Soviet army advisor, nor the local civic leaders, sought to prevent the aggression. A unit of Civic Militia cadets which also arrived at the scene did not intervene, but some of its members joined in the looting and violence which continued inside and outside the building.

Among the slain Jews, nine had been shot dead, two were killed with bayonets, and the rest beaten or stoned to death. The dead included women and children. The mob also killed a Jewish nurse (Estera Proszowska), whom the attackers had mistaken for a Polish female attempting to aid the Jews. Two Jewish people not residing at Planty Street dwelling were also murdered on this day in separate incidents. Regina Fisz, her three-week old child, and a male companion were abducted at their home at 15 Leonarda Street by a group of four men led by Civic Militia corporal Stefan Mazur. They were robbed and driven out of the city, where Regina and her baby were shot while allegedly trying to escape, while her friend did manage to escape. Three non-Jewish Poles were among the dead. Two uniformed state servicemen were killed in gunfire exchange, most likely shot by Jews defending themselves. The cause of death of the third man remains unexplained.

==Cessation of violence==
The pogrom ended at roughly 3:00 p.m. with the arrival of new security units from a nearby Public Security Academy, advanced by Colonel Stanisław Kupsza, and additional troops from Warsaw. Following the discharge of warning shots, on the order of Major Kazimierz Konieczny, the new troops swiftly restored order, posted guards, and removed all the survivors as well as corpses from the dwelling and its proximity.

The violence, nevertheless, did not stop. Wounded Jews being taken to the local hospital were beaten and robbed by soldiers, and the injured were assaulted in the hospital by other patients. A civilian crowd approached one of the hospitals and demanded that the hurt Jews be handed over, but the hospital staff refused.

Trains passing through Kielce&#x27;s main railway station were scrutinized for Jews by civilians and SOK railway guards, resulting in at least two passengers being murdered. As many as 30 more may have been killed in this manner, as the train murders reportedly continued for several months after the pogrom. The large-scale disorder in Kielce ultimately ended some nine hours after it started. Polish-born Julia Pirotte, a well-known French photojournalist with the French Resistance, photographed the pogrom&#x27;s immediate aftermath.

==Aftermath==
Three days after the pogrom, surviving Jews and local residents buried the victims in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery. Government authorities ordered military units and local residents to attend the funeral as a sign of respect for the victims. The United States Memorial Museum states &quot;the mass violence of the Kielce pogrom drew on an entrenched local history of antisemitism—especially false allegations accusing Jews of using the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes (a charge known as a “blood libel”)—with the intent of discouraging the return of Jewish Holocaust survivors to Poland.&quot;

===Reaction of the Communist government===
One immediate reaction of the Communist government of Poland was to attempt to blame the pogrom on Polish independence underground, alleging that uniformed members of anti-communist formations backing the Polish government-in-exile were egging the mob on. At the funeral of the Jewish victims, the Minister of Public Security, Stanisław Radkiewicz, stated that the pogrom was &quot;a deed committed by the emissaries of the Polish government in the West and General Anders, with the approval of Home Army soldiers.&quot; Other early official statements at the time followed this line.

After these initial attempts to blame the pogrom on &quot;reactionary elements&quot; opposed to the Communist regime, the Communist Party changed its policy. Party memoranda and internal reports pointed out that the local population felt no sympathy for the victims and was unwilling to publicly condemn the perpetrators. The July 1946 report of the Radom Department of Information and Propaganda noted that &quot;the Jewish pogrom in Kielce met with the moral approval of many groups in our society&quot;. According to Gross, the Communist Party decided not to publicly condemn the pogrom because at the time it was &quot;deeply committed to the struggle for the hearts and minds of the Polish population&quot;. In July 1946, the Secretariat of the Central Committee did not place on the agenda the issue of the pogrom, and documents submitted by high party officials and other internal reports described the pogrom as an explosion of popular anger against the &quot;parasitic elements&quot; of society. Gross concludes that in post-war Poland, &quot;while Jews were literally running away from Communism&quot; and leaving for Israel, &quot;the Communists were politically running away from the Jews&quot;, in an effort to expand their consensus base in Polish society.

Additional investigation into the circumstances of the massacre was opposed by the communist regime until the era of Solidarity, when in December 1981 an article was published in the Solidarity newspaper &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot;. However, the return of repressive government meant that files could not be accessed for research until after the fall of Communism in 1989, by which time many eyewitnesses had died. It was then discovered that many of the documents relating to the pogrom had been allegedly destroyed by fire or deliberately by military authorities.

===Trials===
Between 9 and 11 July 1946, twelve civilians were tried by the Supreme Military Court for participating in the pogrom. Nine were sentenced to death and executed the following day by firing squad on the orders of Bolesław Bierut. The remaining three received prison terms of 7 years, 10 years, and life. Overall, 10 trials were held, resulting in 39 convictions. The trials of militiamen and UB officers suspected of participating in the riots took place in September and October. As a result, several defendants were sentenced to prison and several were demoted. On 18 November, 15 civilian were tried, of which nine were found guilty. One was sentenced to life in prison, while the others received prison terms ranging from two to 15 years. On 3 December, 7 more soldiers were tried and received prison terms. On 13 December, the trial of the UB commandant in Kielce, Władysław Spychaj-Sobczyński, and two militia commanders, Kuźnicki and Gwiazdowicz, started. Of them, only Kuźnicki (who died in 1947) was found guilty and sentenced to one year in prison.

Aside from Kielce Voivodeship&#x27;s Civic Militia commandant, Major Wiktor Kuźnicki, who was sentenced to one year for &quot;failing to stop the crowd&quot;, only one high-ranking militia officer was punished—for the theft of shoes from a dead body. Mazur&#x27;s explanation regarding his killing of the Fisz family was accepted. Meanwhile, the regional UBP chief, Colonel Władysław Sobczyński, and his men were cleared of any wrongdoing. The official reaction to the pogrom was described by Anita J. Prazmowska in &quot;Cold War History&quot;, Vol. 2, No. 2:

&quot;Clearly, during the period when the first investigations were launched and the trial, a most likely politically motivated decision had been made not to proceed with disciplinary action. This was in spite of very disturbing evidence that emerged during the pre-trial interviews. It is entirely feasible that instructions not to punish the MO and UBP commanders had been given because of the politically sensitive nature of the evidence. Evidence heard by the military prosecutor revealed major organisational and ideological weaknesses within these two security services.&quot;

The neighbour of the Błaszczyk family who had originally suggested to Henryk that he had been kidnapped by Jews was subsequently tried, but acquitted.

===Effects on Jewish emigration from Poland===

The ruthlessness of the murders put an end to the expectation of many Jews that they would be able to resettle in Poland after the end of the Nazi German occupation and precipitated a mass exodus of Polish Jewry. , a historian at Wrocław University estimated that from July 1945 until June 1946 about fifty thousand Jews crossed the Polish border illegally. In July 1946, almost twenty thousand decided to start a new life abroad. Polish Minister Marian Spychalski, motivated by political and humanitarian reasons, signed a decree allowing Jews to leave officially without visas or exit permits, and the Jewish emigration from Poland increased dramatically. In August 1946 the number of emigrants increased to thirty thousand. In September 1946, twelve thousand Jews left Poland. By the spring of 1947, wrote Bernhard and Szlajfer, the number of Jews in Poland—in large part arriving from the Soviet Union—declined from 240,000 to 90,000 due to mass migration. Britain demanded that Poland halt the Jewish exodus, but their pressure was largely unsuccessful.

===Reaction of the Catholic Church===
Six months before the Kielce pogrom, during the celebration of Hanukkah, a hand grenade had been thrown into the headquarters of the local Jewish community. The Jewish Community Council had approached the Bishop of Kielce, , requesting that he admonish the Polish people to refrain from attacking the Jews. The bishop refused, replying that &quot;as long as the Jews concentrated upon their private business Poland was interested in them, but at the point when Jews began to interfere in Polish politics and public life, they insulted the Poles&#x27; national sensibilities&quot;.

Similar remarks were delivered by the Bishop of Lublin, Stefan Wyszyński, when he was approached by a Jewish delegation. Wyszyński stated that the widespread hostility to Jews was provoked by Jewish backing of Communism (there was a widespread perception that Jews were supportive of Soviet-installed Communist administration in Poland; see &quot;Żydokomuna&quot;), which had also been the reason why &quot;the Germans murdered the Jewish nation&quot;. Wyszyński also gave some credence to blood libel stories, commenting that the issue of the use of Christian blood was never fully clarified.

The controversial stance of the Polish Roman Catholic Church towards anti-Jewish violence was criticised by the American, British and Italian ambassadors to Poland. Reports of the Kielce pogrom caused a major sensation in the United States, leading the American ambassador to Poland to insist that Cardinal August Hlond hold a press conference and explain the position of the church. In the conference held on 11 July 1946, Hlond condemned the violence, but attributed it not to racial causes but to rumours concerning the killing of Polish children by Jews. Hlond put the blame for the deterioration in Polish-Jewish relations on collaboration with the Soviet-backed Communist occupiers, Jews &quot;occupying leading positions in Poland in state life&quot;. This position was echoed by Polish rural clergy and Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha, who reportedly stated that the Jews had brought it upon themselves.

===Other reactions===
Historian Łukasz Krzyżanowski analyzed the reactions to the pogrom and concludes: &quot;Simply put, the Kielce pogrom met with approbation in many circles.&quot; He documents that some meetings held to commemorate the victims were interrupted by antisemitic shouting and groups of workers could not reach agreement to pass resolutions condemning the pogrom.

==Commemoration==
Following the fall of communism, several commemorative plaques were unveiled in Kielce. In 1990 the first plaque was unveiled following the involvement of then Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa. A monument by New York City-based artist Jack Sal entitled &quot;White/Wash II&quot; commemorating the victims was dedicated on 4 July 2006, in Kielce, on the 60th anniversary of the pogrom. At the dedication ceremony, a statement from the President of the Republic of Poland Lech Kaczyński condemned the events as a &quot;crime and a great shame for the Poles and tragedy for the Polish Jews&quot;. The presidential statement asserted that in today&#x27;s democratic Poland there is &quot;no room for antisemitism&quot; and brushed off any generalizations of the antisemitic image of the Polish nation as a stereotype. Another monument intended to be a representative grave for the victims, was unveiled in the city in 2010.

<text>HMCS &quot;Fortune&quot; was a built for the Royal Canadian Navy. Named for Fortune Bay, located in Newfoundland, the vessel served in the Royal Canadian Navy for ten years before being sold for commercial purposes. Renamed MV &quot;Edgewater Fortune&quot; she saw service as a commercial yacht.

==Design==
The Bay class were designed and ordered as replacements for the Second World War-era minesweepers that the Royal Canadian Navy operated at the time. Similar to the , they were constructed of wood planking and aluminum framing.

Displacing and at deep load, the minesweepers were long with a beam of and a draught of . They had a complement of 38 officers and ratings. The Bay-class minesweepers were powered by two GM 12-cylinder diesel engines driving two shafts creating . This gave the ships a maximum speed of . The ships were armed with one Bofors 40 mm gun and were equipped with minesweeping gear.

==Service==
Initially named &quot;Belle Isle&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; was laid down on 24 April 1952 by Victoria Machinery Depot at Victoria with the yard number 51 and launched on 14 April 1953. The minesweeper was commissioned on 3 November 1954 with the hull identification number 151.

&quot;Fortune&quot; joined the Second Canadian Minesweeping Squadron after commissioning. In November 1955, the Second Canadian Minesweeping Squadron was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California.

After nine years of naval service, including acting as the flagship of the Second Canadian Minesweeping Squadron during the Cuban Missile Crisis, &quot;Fortune&quot; was decommissioned on 28 February 1964. Put up for auction in 1965 by the Crown Assets Corporation, the ship was then sold into mercantile service. She was initially known as &quot;Greenpeace Two&quot; and used in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the Cannikin nuclear test in the Aleutians in November 1971. The vessel was then refitted as the charter yacht MV &quot;Edgewater Fortune&quot; and was used for short cruises along the coast of British Columbia. She was also occasionally used for fishing, and for school trips to learn about the wildlife on the coast and in the water. Subsequently, the ship was turned into a floating home in Vancouver.

<text>Suðuroy (pronounced [ˈsuːwʊrɔi] or [ˈsuːri] literally ‘South Island’, ) is the southernmost of the Faroe Islands. The island covers 163.7 square kilometres (63.2 sq mi). In 2018 the population was 4,601. Suðuroy region (sýsla) comprises this island and Lítla Dímun, the next isle northward in the Faroes, which is uninhabited.

== History ==
One ancient settlement, Víkarbyrgi was abandoned late in the 1990s. Another settlement, Akraberg was abandoned around 1350 because of the Black Death; the people who lived there at that time came from Friesland, and legend has it that people in Hørg (in Sumba) can trace their ancestry back to this settlement, which was situated on the southernmost point of the island. 

In the 17th century, Suðuroy was subjected to repeated attacks by North African pirates, who in the Faroe Islands were referred to as Turks when North Africa belonged to the Ottoman Empire. One well known such incident was the Slave raid of Suðuroy. They abducted several women and children. Famine ensued, and many of the island&#x27;s inhabitants died of starvation. In 1615, the pirate-plagued Hvalba was rescued by two Danish warships in the spring. The pirates, who used Hvalba as a kind of base port, had unfortunately sailed 14 days before the arrival of the Danish squadron.

The village of Sandvík was re-established in the 19th century. Fámara was re-settled in 2010 with the expansion of Vágur beyond its original town borders. Two more settlements were started in the early and mid-20th century: Botni, northwest of Vágur, and Tjaldavík, in a bay southeast of Øravík. Both sites have been abandoned again.

Suðuroy&#x27;s population has been falling gradually since the 1970s. In 1985, the island had 5,881 inhabitants, but by 2019 the population fell to a record low of 4,591.

== Geography ==
The highest point of Suðuroy is the mountain Gluggarnir (), but the most famous peak is definitely the mountain of Beinisvørð northwest of the village of Sumba. The Beinisvørð and its scenery have been praised by the local poet Poul F. Joensen (1898–1970), as well as other Faroese poets. Suðuroy is the island which has the most islets and skerries. Suðuroy and the islets and skerries near the island number 263, including the island itself.

The inhabited settlements on Suðuroy include, from north to south: Sandvík, Hvalba, Froðba, Tvøroyri, Trongisvágur, Øravík, Fámjin, Hov, Porkeri, Nes, Vágur, Fámara, Akrar, Lopra and Sumba.

Suðuroy is also the only island of the Faroes which has coalmines, one of which is still active. It is located in Hvalba, near the tunnel. Other coalmines were in Rangabotnur in Trongisvágur (on the south side of Trongisvágsfjørður), and in Fámjin. The bays of Øravík, Trongisvágur, Fámjin, Vágur and Hvalba are designated &quot;grind&quot; bays.

In contrast to the name Suðuroy (South Island, singular), the name Suðuroyggjar (Southern Islands, plural) refers to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. To refer to the islands south of Skopunarfjørður one can colloquially say (going) &quot;sunnanfjørðs&quot; or formally Suðurøkið.

=== Important Bird Area ===
The western side of the island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially northern fulmars (100,000 pairs), European storm petrels (2500 pairs), European shags (200 pairs), black-legged kittiwakes (39,000 pairs), Atlantic puffins (20,000 pairs), common guillemots (31,900 individuals) and black guillemots (400 pairs).

== Transport and infrastructure ==
MS &quot;Smyril&quot; operates two to three times daily between Tórshavn and Suðuroy, leaving from the new ferry port of Krambatangi on the south side of the fjord of Trongisvágsfjørður. The journey takes two hours. There are two national bus routes in Suðuroy, route 700 operates between Tvøroyri and Sumba (the southern line) and 701 between Fámjin and Sandvík (the northern line). There is a heliport at Froðba with flights to Tórshavn and Vágar Airport.

A road network runs the entire length of the island, including five road tunnels: the Sandvíkartunnilin (1969), the old and new Hvalbiartunnilin (1965 and 2021), Hovstunnilin (2007) and Sumbiartunnilin (1997). The Fámjinstunnilin will be started with in 2022. The proposed Suðuroyartunnilin would connect the island with Skúvoy and Sandoy, replacing the ferry &quot;Smyril.&quot;
The Suðuroy electricity grid depends on the Vágur 13 MW diesel, 6.3 MW wind turbines and the 3.3 MW hydro Botnur power plant. The island is not connected to other islands. A 250 kW solar park was installed at Sumba in 2019, and produces 2 MWh/day at best. Power supply agency SEV calculated that two 900 kW wind turbines could save DKK 6 million per year on diesel, and seven Enercon wind turbines at a combined 6.3 MW were installed at Porkeri Mountains in 2020. The wind turbines reduced the consumption of oil. A 6MW / 7.5MWh grid battery and a syncron compensator is planned to stabilize the grid.

== Sights and activities ==

=== Cliffs ===

Vágseiði is a place with cliffs towards south, but the road is down by the sea, the skerries are called Heltnarnar and a cliff on Vágseiði is called Múlatangi.

Eggjarvegur on the south side of the fjord, Vágsfjørður, leads up to Eggjarnar, on a vertical cliff with a view towards Beinisvørð in the south and to Vágseiði in the north. On Eggjarnar, visitors can find two concrete bunkers which were British observation points during World War II. There is also an abandoned former Loran-C radar station, as it closed down in the mid-1970s.

South of Eggjarnar is the isthmus of Lopra, Lopranseiði, which is around above sea level. An islet called Lopranshólmur is just a few metres from the cliffs of Lopranseiði. The cliff Beinisvørð is south of Lopranseiði, in between are some skerries, where the Dutch ship SS Westerbeek was shipwrecked in 1742. Eighty-four men were on board, three died when the ship ran aground, one fell down while trying to climb the cliff, but eighty men survived. They had to climb up the vertical cliff in order to survive, they found a place on the cliff where they could stand, they climbed from the ship to the cliff by the broken mast.

=== Fámjin ===

Fámjin is one of two villages which are located on the west coast of Suðuroy, Sumba is the other one. All the other villages are located on the east coast. Fámjin has a special reef in the middle of the bay, which close the bay at low tide, except for a sailing channel made by men in order for fishing boats to be able to go fishing. The small fishing harbour is inside this reef. There is a lake just above the village, called Kirkjuvatn, the path starts near the church. Another attraction in Fámjin are the cliffs and gorge west of the village, called Prestgjógv (Priest Gorge). The main attraction of Fámjin however is the original Faroese flag, Merkið, which is hanging inside of the church. It was made in 1919, by some Faroese students who studied in Copenhagen. One of them was Jens Oliver Lisberg from Fámjin. The flag was not recognized as the official flag of the Faroe Islands until World War II, when the Faroes were occupied by the British, and Denmark by Germany, and the islands needed their own flag. Since then, the Merkið has been the official flag of the Faroe Islands. Inside the church of Fámjin is also the Fámjin stone, a Runestone with runic inscriptions.

=== Hikes ===
Tvøroyri there is an attractive walk across the mountains to a valley called Hvannhagi. There is a view over the valley and to Lítla Dímun and Stóra Dímun and the sea from above the valley. No roads lead to this valley.

=== Jóansøka ===
Tvøroyri and Vágur take turns in hosting an annual civic Midsummer festival called Jóansøka. It can be described as a smaller version of the Ólavsøka held in Tórshavn. It runs in late June, in the last weekend of June, the rowing competition is always on Saturday of the Jóansøka weekend.

=== Theatres ===
In Øravíkarlíð near the ferry terminal the island&#x27;s main cultural venue SALT sits in a former salt silo. It was abandoned in 1980 and after repurposing opened as a theatre in 2017.

== Sports in Suðuroy ==

=== Football in Suðuroy ===
The oldest sports club in the Faroe Islands, the football club Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag (TB) was founded in Tvøroyri on May 13, 1892, and is thereby the 9th oldest football club in the Danish Kingdom. There were three other football clubs in Suðuroy: Vágs Bóltfelag, (VB), Royn from Hvalba and the football club from Sumba, but VB Vágur and Sumba merged in 2005 to VB/Sumba (a similar merger under the name Sumba/VB had been attempted in the 1995 season but it lasted only this one season). On January 1, 2010 a new football club has been founded in Suðuroy, it is called FC Suðuroy and currently consists of the prior VB/Sumba.

TB Tvøroyri currently (2013) competes in the best Faroese football division; FC Suðuroy plays in the second best division. Both TB Tvøroyri and VB Vágur have won the Faroese National Championship (TB seven times, the last being in 1987, and VB once in the year 2000); but since the success is lacking in recent years, there is a growing debate about merging the four teams into one, (VB and Sumba have, as mentioned above, already joined forces since 2005). Royn Hvalba is playing in 3rd division in 2013.

=== Swimming in Suðuroy ===
Suðuroy has recently had good results in international swimming competitions. The two swimming clubs in Suðuroy &quot;Vágs Svimjifelag&quot; and &quot;Tvøroyrar Svimjifelag&quot; joined forces 6 September 2007 and founded Susvim, which is for the whole island. A young man from Vágur has had the best results until now. Pál Joensen won triple gold in the 2008 European Junior Swimming Championships on the short course in the men&#x27;s 400 M, 800 M and 1500 M Freestyle. Two years later he won silver in the Men&#x27;s 1500 M Freestyle at the 2010 European Aquatics Championships. Other swimmers from Susvim have also had good results in Faroe Islands and in Denmark and other countries and at the Island Games competitions.

=== Rowing in Suðuroy ===
There are two active rowing clubs in Suðuroy, Vágs Kappróðrarfelag from Vágur and Froðbiar Sóknar Róðrarfelag from Tvøroyri and the villages around Trongisvágsfjørður (fjord). There are also rowing clubs in Sumba and in Hvalba. In Sumba they had a boat which was called &quot;Broddur&quot;, but they have not been active for some years now. In Hvalba they had a boat which was named &quot;Snopprikkur&quot; after a well-known man from the history of Suðuroy (Suðuroyar Sagnir). Vágs Kappróðrarfelag has these boats: &quot;Royndin Fríða&quot;, which is a so-called 5-mannafar, &quot;Smyril&quot;, which is a 6-mannafar, and &quot;Toftaregin&quot;, which is an 8-mannafar and Vágbingur, which is a 10-mannafar. Froðbiar Sóknar Róðrarfelag has the boats Firvaldur, which is a 5-mannafar (Firvaldur means Butterfly), Firildur and Hulda are also 5-mannafar, Tvørábáturin is a 6-mannafar, Suðringur and another Tvørábáturin are 10-mannafar (there are two boats which are called Tvørábáturin, which means the boat from Tvøroyri).

<doc id="1193618" wikidata="Q1156288" url="?curid=1193618" title="Shimazu Yoshihiro">
<text>was the second son of Shimazu Takahisa and the younger brother of Shimazu Yoshihisa. Traditionally believed to be the 17th head of the Shimazu clan, he was a skilled general during the Sengoku period who greatly contributed to the unification of Kyūshū.

== Early life and rise ==
He is said to have been born in Izaku Castle in 1535. He was the castle lord in command of Iino Castle.

Yoshihiro along with Niiro Tadamoto defeated the Itō clan at the Battle of Kizaki, in 1572, and defeated the Otomo clan with his brothers in the 1578 at Battle of Mimigawa. In 1587, facing Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s troops that sought to pacify Kyūshū, Yoshihiro pressed for war even after his brother and the head of clan Yoshihisa surrendered. After Yoshihisa repeatedly asked for the surrender, Yoshihiro finally accepted. After Yoshihisa became a Buddhist monk, it was believed that he became the head of the clan, though the real power remained in Yoshihisa&#x27;s hands.

==Service under Hideyoshi==
He had been a willing and skillful general under Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In both 1592 and 1597 of the Seven-Year War, Yoshihiro set his foot on the Korean peninsula and successfully carried out a series of battles. In 1597, working together with Tōdō Takatora, Katō Yoshiaki and Konishi Yukinaga, Yoshihiro defeated Won Kyun&#x27;s navy. At the Battle of Sacheon (泗川) in 1598, facing a Ming army counting 37,000, Yoshihiro defeated them with only 7,000 soldiers. On the final battle of the war in 1598, the Battle of Noryang, Yoshihiro&#x27;s objective was to cross the Noryang Strait, link up with Konishi and retreat to Japan. The Korean admiral Yi Sun-sin who had obstructed Yoshiaki died in this battle. Afterward, Yoshihiro rescued the Japanese commanders and returned to Japan.

== Battle of Sekigahara ==
After Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s death in 1598, the land became split between Toyotomi supporters backing Ishida Mitsunari and those that supported Tokugawa Ieyasu, eventually culminating in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. According to novels (Rakusuishū 『落穂集』) of the Edo Period, Yoshihiro was initially supposed to Ieyasu&#x27;s side. He was crushed by Ishida Mitsunari&#x27;s army upon his arrival for a rescue Torii Mototada during the siege of Fushimi Castle and, after being humiliated, he took the side of Ishida Mitsunari instead. However, recent research indicated that Yoshihiro had chosen to side with Mitsunari from the very start, before Mōri Terumoto announced the declaration of war against the Tokugawa in July 1600. Yoshihiro also played an important role as a member of Mitsunari&#x27;s core staff and was pivotal in persuading Uesugi Kagekatsu to ally with them.

On September 13, Shimazu Yoshihiro led his soldiers to besiege Sone Castle and bombarding Sone castle with their artilleries. Ii Naomasa and Honda Tadakatsu implored Mizuno Katsunari to repulse the Shimazu forces. In response, Katsunari went out with sallying force with his younger brother, Mizuno Tadatane, to defend Sone Castle. Katsunari ordered his artilleries to return fire at the turret of the Shimazu artilleries, then he led his army to storm the Shimazu position and manage to overcome the Shimazu clan&#x27;s army, causing Yoshihiro to retreat and abandon the siege against Sone castle. After he beat the Shimazu forces, returned to Ieyasu to ask permission to participate on the Sekigahara main battle which planned in the next day. However, Ieyasu instead ordered Katsunari to guard Sone castle and keep an eyes on Ogaki castle which located nearby and being controlled by Western army loyal to Mitsunari. In response, Katsunari then brought his troops at midnight to surround Ogaki castle, beating a Western army led by Fukuhara Nagataka, and burning the wall and outer citadels of the castle. As Katsunari burned the outer citadels of Ogaki castle, the Western army nearby that area, including the Shimazu clan who had just been beaten by Katsunari&#x27;s army, decided to abort their plan to go in as they thought the Ogaki castle could not be saved. Then Yoshihiro decided to retreat into Ise Province.

According to the scripts of Yoshihiro&#x27;s subordinate Kando Kutarō, Yoshihiro got along with Mitsunari from the start, but their relationship was distorted by the novelists of the Edo Period. It was said that Mitsunari did not listen to any of Yoshihiro&#x27;s plans, including a surprise night attack on the day before the actual battle of Sekigahara. On the day of the battle, Yoshihiro and his 1500 men held ground and did not fight at all. After the rest of Mitsunari&#x27;s side was wiped out, Yoshihiro was stranded among at least 30,000 of Ieyasu&#x27;s troops. Vastly outnumbered, Yoshihiro tried to make a charge against Ieyasu himself but after his nephew Shimazu Toyohisa demanded that he not kill himself over a meaningless battle, Yoshihiro instead chose to charge straight through Ieyasu&#x27;s troop to make an exit to the other side.

Yoshihiro had his troops make a fighting retreat called &quot;Sutegamari&quot; (捨て奸), where until a certain number of men died holding a position and repelling an attack, the main body of the army fought as well. Though Toyohisa and the bulk of the troops died, the charge and retreat were a success with a wound dealt to Ii Naomasa in the process. After beating back the chase, he picked up his wife at Sumiyoshi in Settsu Province and returned to Satsuma Province by ships. The Japanese historian Shiramine Jun studied why the Shimazu clan behaved torpidly and deduced it was because Yoshihiro had become involved in the power struggling between his brother Yoshihisa and Ijūin Tadamune. It led Yoshihiro losing the support of Yoshihisa, which trapped Yoshihiro due to the lack of support from the Shimazu clan.

== Death ==

In 1602, after recognizing why and how Yoshihiro behaved on the battlefield, Ieyasu had the Shimazu clan retain its domain and let Yoshihiro&#x27;s son Shimazu Tadatsune succeed him. Yoshihiro retired to Sakurajima and took up teaching younger generations. He died in 1619 and several of his retainers who had fought alongside him followed him by committing suicide.

On August 23, 1918, Yoshihiro was posthumously awarded the courtesy title of senior third rank (&quot;shō san-mi&quot;, 正三位) by Emperor Taishō.

== Family ==
It had traditionally been believed that he became the seventeenth head of the Shimazu clan after Yoshihisa, but it is currently believed that he let Yoshihisa keep his position. Yoshihiro was essential to the Shimazu clan and both Ieyasu and Hideyoshi tried to divide the clan by treating Yoshihiro well, but treating the elder brother Yoshihisa badly, which did not succeed. He was a devoted Buddhist, and built a monument for enemy troops during the Seven-Year War.

<doc id="1193629" wikidata="Q731969" url="?curid=1193629" title="Fardeen Khan">
<text>Fardeen Khan (; born 8 March 1974) is an Indian actor who mainly works in Hindi films. Born to actor and film producer Feroz Khan, he is part of the Khan family. He made his acting debut in the film &quot;Prem Aggan&quot; (1998), for which he won the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. 

Khan went onto star in the films &quot;Jungle&quot; (2000), &quot;Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya&quot; (2001), &quot;Bhoot&quot; (2003), &quot;Dev&quot; (2004), &quot;No Entry&quot; (2005), and &quot;All the Best&quot; (2009). After a career decline with several critical and commercial failures, he appeared in &quot;Dulha Mil Gaya&quot; (2010), following which, he took a break from acting. Khan marked his comeback with the period drama series &quot;Heeramandi&quot; in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Fardeen Khan was born on 8 March 1974 in Mumbai. He is the son of Bollywood actor, director, and producer Feroz Khan. Through his father, he is of mixed Pashtun and Persian descent, while his mother is a Sindhi Hindu. Khan is the nephew of actors Sanjay Khan and Akbar Khan and the cousin of fashion designer Suzanne Khan and actor Zayed Khan.

After graduating in business management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Khan returned to India to pursue a career in film and trained in acting at the Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Institute.

==Career==
===Early work (1998–2003)===
Khan made his acting debut in 1998 with a leading role in the romance film &quot;Prem Aggan&quot;, which garnered him the Filmfare Best Debut Award. He then starred in the survival thriller &quot;Jungle&quot;, in 2000. Rediff.com wrote, &quot;Fardeen redeems himself, after the disaster that was &quot;Prem Aggan&quot;.&quot;

His career marked a turning point after he received critical recognition for the 2001 romantic thriller &quot;Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya&quot;. &quot;Screen&quot; magazine noted, &quot;Fardeen Khan as the happy-go-lucky photographer, is pleasing on the eye, light footed and comfortable with the part.&quot; His other films of the year were the crime comedy &quot;Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega&quot; and the romantic drama &quot;Hum Ho Gaye Aapke&quot;, both box office failures.

Khan had three releases in 2002: The romance &quot;Kitne Door Kitne Paas&quot; was a failure, while the romance drama &quot;Kuch Tum Kaho Kuch Hum Kahein&quot; and the family drama &quot;Om Jai Jagadish&quot; received mixed responses. For the former, PlanetBollywood.com stated, &quot;Fardeen comes out a winner with a decent performance. He&#x27;s obviously put in some effort into his performance.&quot; For the latter, Rediff.com said, &quot;Fardeen looks good and smiles sweetly whenever the camera zooms onto his face. But he needs to learn there is more to playing a part than just looking good.&quot; Khan again had three releases in 2003. The romantic comedy &quot;Khushi&quot; and the romantic thriller &quot;Janasheen&quot; both failed at the box office. For &quot;Khushi&quot;, Bollywood Hungama praised his performance and noted, &quot;Fardeen Khan&#x27;s performance is a revelation. The actor not only looks smashing, but does an equally smashing job in emotional sequences mainly, which were his weak points earlier.&quot; The supernatural horror &quot;Bhoot&quot; was his only successful film that year. Film critic Taran Adarsh wrote, &quot;Fardeen Khan registers an impact in a small but significant role.&quot;

===Career progression (2004–2009)===
Khan received critical acclaim for both his films in 2004. In &quot;Dev&quot;, he played a misguided law graduate. Bollywood Hungama noted, &quot;Fardeen Khan springs a surprise by enacting a difficult role with flourish. His scenes with the two veterans are proof enough that the youngster has evolved into a fine actor.&quot; Rediff.com wrote, &quot;Fardeen portrays the transformation of the innocent but troubled youngster to jihadi sharpshooter with conviction.&quot; He next played a hacker and thief in &quot;Fida&quot;. Rediff.com stated, &quot;Fardeen is his usual suave self.&quot;

Khan had his career&#x27;s highest grosser in 2005, with &quot;No Entry&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film of 2005. &quot;Planet Bollywood&quot; noted, &quot;Fardeen Khan shows a great flair for comedy at his first attempt. He shares stellar situations with Anil Kapoor in the latter half of the film.&quot; He went on to appear in &quot;Heyy Babyy&quot; (2007), &quot;Life Partner&quot; (2009), and &quot;All the Best: Fun Begins&quot; (2009), among others.

===Hiatus and return to acting (2010–present)===
In 2010, after his last starring role, Khan took a hiatus from the movie business in order to focus on his family. In December 2020, speculation arose that he may be planning a comeback to acting after being spotted outside the office of film director Mukesh Chhabra. Chhabra later confirmed that the two were exploring opportunities and that they would begin working on a new project in 2021. Khan&#x27;s comeback was confirmed when he announced having joined the cast of Akshay Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Housefull 5&quot;, set to be released in 2025.

==Personal life==
Fardeen is married to Natasha Madhvani, daughter of actress Mumtaz. The couple has a daughter and a son.

In May 2001, Khan was arrested for attempting to buy cocaine.

<text>The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) was a research program at Princeton University that studied parapsychology. Established in 1979 by then Dean of Engineering Robert G. Jahn, PEAR conducted formal studies on two primary subject areas, psychokinesis (PK) and remote viewing. Owing to the controversial nature of the subject matter, the program had a strained relationship with Princeton and was considered by the administration and some faculty to be an embarrassment to the university. Critics suggested that it lacked scientific rigor, used poor methodology, and misused statistics, and characterized it as pseudoscience. PEAR closed in February 2007, being incorporated into the &quot;International Consciousness Research Laboratories (ICRL).

==Parapsychological experiments with random event generators==
PEAR employed electronic random event generators (REGs) to explore the ability of test subjects to use psychokinesis to influence the random output distribution of these devices to conform to their pre-recorded intentions to produce higher numbers, lower numbers, or nominal baselines. Most of these experiments utilized a microelectronic REG, but experiments were also conducted with &quot;a giant, wall-mounted pachinko-like machine with a cascade of bouncing balls&quot;.

In 1986 associates of PEAR published data collected over the course of seven years from a group of subjects attempting to influence random number generators across millions of trials. In all cases, the observed effects were very small (between one and about 0.1%), and although the statistical significance of the results at the P&lt;0.05 level is not generally disputed, detractors point to potential ethical violations and flaws in experiment procedures, as well as questioning the importance of large-sample studies that only marginally clear the p&lt;0.05 significance threshold. The baseline for chance behavior used did not vary as statistically appropriate (baseline bind). Two PEAR researchers attributed this baseline bind to the motivation of the operators to achieve a good baseline and indicates that the random number generator used was not random. It has been noted that a single test subject (presumed to be a member of PEAR&#x27;s staff) participated in 15% of PEAR&#x27;s trials, and was responsible for half of the total observed effect.

James Alcock in a review mentioned various problems with the PEAR experiments such as poor controls and documentation with the possibility of fraud, data selection and optional stopping not being ruled out. Alcock concluded there was no reason to believe the results were from paranormal origin.

The psychologist C. E. M. Hansel, who evaluated Jahn&#x27;s early psychokinesis experiments at the PEAR laboratory, wrote that a satisfactory control series had not been employed, that they had not been independently replicated, and that the reports lacked detail. Hansel noted that &quot;very little information is provided about the design of the experiment, the subjects, or the procedure adopted. Details are not given about the subjects, the times they were tested, or the precise conditions under which they were tested.&quot; Physicist professor Milton Rothman has noted that Jahn&#x27;s experiments at PEAR started from an idealistic assumption, ignored the laws of physics and had no basis in reality.

PEAR&#x27;s results have been criticized for deficient reproducibility. In one instance two German organizations failed to reproduce PEAR&#x27;s results, while PEAR similarly failed to reproduce their own results. An attempt by York University&#x27;s Stan Jeffers also failed to replicate PEAR&#x27;s results.

<text>Iris innominata, the Del Norte County iris, is a species of iris native to southern Oregon, and California along the north coast and Klamath Ranges in Del Norte County, California.

The leaves are dense and evergreen, up to 20 cm. The flower is typically deep golden yellow with darker veins, although colors may vary. The flower stems are about 12 cm and usually bear 1–2 flowers in spring.

It is on the California Native Plant Society &quot;Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California&quot; List 4, Limited distribution (Watch List).

==Cultivation==
&quot;Iris innominata&quot;, used in gardens, does best in locations with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers, in neutral or slightly acidic soil, with good drainage, and sun or partial shade. It is often used for hybridizing with other &quot;Iris&quot; species. Many plants sold under this name in nurseries are hybrids.

<text>Cecil Harold Sewell VC (27 January 1895 – 29 August 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

One of nine children, he was educated at Dulwich College between 1907 and 1912. He was 23 years old, and a lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, British Army, attached to 3rd (Light) Battalion, Tank Corps during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 August 1918 at Fremicourt, France, Lieutenant Sewell, who was in command of a section of Whippet Medium tanks, got out of his own tank and crossed open ground under heavy machine-gun fire to rescue the crew of another Whippet of his section which had side-slipped into a shell-hole, overturned and caught fire. The door of the tank had become jammed against the side of the shell-hole, but Lieutenant Sewell, unaided, dug away the entrance to the door and released the crew. Having done this, he saw one of his own crew lying wounded behind his tank. He crossed the open ground to go to his assistance. Although hit while doing so, he reached the tank. Only few minutes later he was hit, fatally this time, while dressing his wounded driver.

His Victoria Cross and his Whippet tank are displayed at The Tank Museum, Dorset, England.

Two of his brothers were also killed in action. His brother, Bert Sewell, a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, was killed in November 1916. He has no known grave and is commemorated on the Thiepval memorial. His story was featured on the Channel 4 documentary &#x27;The Last Heroes of the Somme&#x27;

<doc id="1193654" wikidata="Q3283154" url="?curid=1193654" title="Year of the Spider">
<text>Year of the Spider is the third studio album by American rock band Cold. It was released on May 13, 2003, through Geffen Records. The album was Cold&#x27;s most commercially successful, debuting at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, with over 101,000 copies sold in its first week. Early pressings of &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; were shipped with a DVD and a temporary tattoo of the Cold spider logo. The DVD included the making of the (as well as the actual) video for &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, fan testimonials, and some home video shot during the recording of the album. This is also the last album with guitarists Terry Balsamo and Kelly Hayes.

==Background==
A year prior to the album&#x27;s release, the mellow ballad &quot;Gone Away&quot; was released on the &quot;WWE Tough Enough 2&quot; soundtrack. Its music video, which met with considerable airplay upon release, listed it as from the album &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; despite the long wait for its release. &quot;Gone Away&quot; was subsequently used as a hidden track; the song begins at 16:06 after 13 minutes and 13 seconds of silence (a reference to the superstitious nature of the band&#x27;s previous effort &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot;). The song &quot;Came All The Way&quot; was a B-side, which was cut late from the album. It&#x27;s mentioned on the back cover of the album&#x27;s booklet. It was later released on the Psi Ops soundtrack.

The album was frequently postponed from its projected release date. As early as April 2002, &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; was scheduled by Geffen for an October 2002 release. Frontman Scooter Ward also expected Elias Soriano of Nonpoint to contribute, but this did not come to fruition.

==Composition and lyrics==
With producer Howard Benson on hand, &quot;Year of the Spider&quot; is significantly more commercial than its dark predecessor, &quot;13 Ways to Bleed on Stage&quot;. It features a variety of guitar styles, violin, viola, and cello, and digital effects as well as a number of power ballads. While still dwelling on topics like drug abuse and relationships, other topics are covered. &quot;Cure My Tragedy&quot; deals with the struggle with the cancer Scooter Ward&#x27;s sister was having during the album&#x27;s recording. &quot;The Day Seattle Died&quot; is about the deaths of grunge icons Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley. The band originally called the song &quot;Kurt&quot;, but decided to pay homage to Staley as well after contemplating the apathy of the media towards his death; &quot;[Staley] dies, and he doesn&#x27;t even get on the front page of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. I have to do somethin&#x27;- not that I matter at all, but it matters to me.&quot; The album&#x27;s final song, &quot;Kill the Music Industry&quot;, was not directly about any record label or individual, but the state of the music industry, according to Scooter Ward; &quot;I hate all the bullshit they try to cram down your throat. Every kind of music I hear has no emotion to it anymore- no feeling, no depth in the lyrics.&quot;

&quot;Stupid Girl&quot;, served as the album&#x27;s lead single and was the only Cold single to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number 87. Its music video garnered frequent airplay as well. Like &quot;Gone Away&quot;, the introductory song &quot;Remedy&quot; was used by WWE as the theme for the Backlash 2003 pay-per-view.

Following the release of the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Suffocate&quot;, to radio stations, plans were set-forth for a video to accompany the song. However, for reasons unknown, Geffen refused to make the video or promote the album any further. The stalemate with the label led to frustrations within the band, and in early 2004, Terry Balsamo departed, replacing Ben Moody as lead guitarist in Evanescence. Balsamo was later replaced by ex-Darwin&#x27;s Waiting Room guitarist Eddie Rendini. The band made efforts to release another single in &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, but Geffen stayed true to their earlier promise by not financing or promoting the album any further.

<doc id="1193660" wikidata="Q2250163" url="?curid=1193660" title="Flag of North Brabant">
<text>The flag of North Brabant () consists of a chequy pattern with 24 distinct fields in the colours red and white or gules and argent. The flag has been used since the Middle Ages, but fell into disuse in the 18th century. The flag is now back in use, and has been the official flag of North Brabant since 1959.

 The flag of the province of North Brabant was adopted by the Provincial Council on January 21, 1959. In addition, the following description was used: &quot;Rectangular, consisting of four horizontal stripes, divided into six adjacent surfaces of red and white and six vertical lines, divided into four adjacent sides of red and white.&quot;

The coat of arms of Croatia and the flag of the Belgian province of Antwerp make use of the same pattern, but the flag of Antwerp makes use of the colors red, white, blue and yellow.

==History==
The North Brabantian flag dates from the Middle Ages. The colours gules and argent are used in Brabant standards, flags, and pennants since the proclamation of the County of Louvain (942 CE) during the Lotharingian period. Later, the Duchy of Brabant took these colours on. During the Middle Ages and the centuries after, the red and white would often be used. Ships sailed under a red-white flag, especially in Antwerp.
At the end of the 18th century, the flag fell into disuse, only to make a comeback in the 20th century. Only since 1959 has the red and white chequered flag become the official flag of the province of North Brabant.

==Highest seniority==
North Brabant flag has the highest seniority among all Dutch province flags. For that reason, it hung until 2006 immediately to the right of the throne of the monarch in the Ridderzaal. On official occasions, the flag should always be on the very left side for the spectators. As of Prinsjesdag 2006, the flags in de Ridderzaal were replaced by tapestries bearing the provincial coat of arms.

<doc id="1193663" wikidata="Q1318001" url="?curid=1193663" title="Herbert Huncke">
<text>Herbert Edwin Huncke ( ; January 9, 1915 – August 8, 1996) was an American writer and poet, and an active participant in a number of emerging cultural, social and aesthetic movements of the 20th century in America. He was a member of the Beat Generation and is reputed to have coined the term.

==Early life==
Born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and raised in Chicago, Herbert Huncke was a street hustler, high school dropout, and drug user. He left Chicago as a teenager after his parents divorced and began living as a hobo, jumping trains throughout the United States and bonding with other vagrants through shared destitution and common experience. Although Huncke later came to regret his loss of family ties, in his autobiography, &quot;Guilty of Everything&quot;, he states that his lengthy jail sentences were a partial result of his lack of family support.

== New York City and Times Square ==
Huncke hitchhiked to New York City in 1939. He was dropped off at 103rd and Broadway, and he asked the driver how to find 42nd Street. &quot;You walk straight down Broadway,&quot; the man said, &quot;and you will find 42nd Street.&quot; Huncke, always a stylish dresser, bought a boutonnière for his jacket and headed for 42nd Street. For the next 10 years, Huncke was a 42nd Street regular and became known as the &quot;Mayor of 42nd Street.&quot;

At this point, Huncke&#x27;s regular haunts were 42nd Street and Times Square, where he associated with a variety of people, including prostitutes (male and female) and sailors. During World War II, Huncke shipped out to sea as a United States Merchant Marine to ports in South America, Africa, and Europe. He landed on the beach of Normandy three days after the invasion.

Aboard ships, Huncke would overcome his drug addiction or maintain it with morphine syrettes supplied by the ship medic. When he returned to New York, he returned to 42nd Street, and it was after one such trip where he met the then-unknown William S. Burroughs, who was selling a sub-machine gun and a box of syrettes. Their first meeting was not cordial: from Burroughs&#x27; appearance and manner, Huncke suspected that he was &quot;heat&quot; (undercover police or FBI). Assured that Burroughs was harmless, Huncke bought the morphine and, at Burroughs&#x27; request, immediately gave him an injection. Burroughs later wrote a fictionalized account of the meeting in his first novel, &quot;Junkie&quot;. Huncke also became a close friend of Joan Adams Vollmer Burroughs, William&#x27;s common-law wife, sharing with her a taste for amphetamines. In the late 1940s he was invited to Texas to grow marijuana on the Burroughs farm. It was here he renewed his acquaintance with the young Abe Green, a fellow train jumper and much later on in the early beatnik scene, a regular reciter of his own enigmatic brand of spontaneous poetry. Despite his comparative youth, Green was often referred to by Huncke as &quot;Old Faithful.&quot; Huncke valued loyalty and it is thought that Abe Green was of &quot;inestimable assistance&quot; to Lucien Carr and Jack Kerouac when it came to the concealment of the weapon used to kill David Kammerer some years later.

During the early 1940s, Huncke was recruited to be a subject in Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s research on the sexual habits of the American male. He was interviewed by Kinsey, and recruited fellow addicts and friends to participate. Huncke had been an unpublished writer since his days in Chicago, and gravitated toward literary types and musicians. In the music world, Huncke visited all the jazz clubs and associated with Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, and Dexter Gordon (with whom he was once busted on 42nd Street for breaking into a parked car). When he first met Allen Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Burroughs, they were interested in writing and also unpublished. They were inspired by his stories of 42nd Street life, criminal life, street slang, and his vast experience with drugs. Huncke was immortalized in Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; as the character Elmo Hassel.

In the late 1940&#x27;s, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Melody and Vickie Russell were apprehended after flipping a car in Queens, New York, trying to run-over a NYPD motorcycle cop. Huncke was picked up simultaneously as he was living with Allen Ginsberg. Herbert Huncke was sentenced to a five year term in the New York State Prison System. &quot;Someone had to do the bit,&quot; Huncke recalled. Allen Ginsberg, a student at Columbia University, was sent to a mental hospital for six months. Vickie Russell&#x27;s (a.k.a. Perscilla Arminger) father was a judge in a neighboring state and took custody of her, relieving her of jail time. Jack Melody&#x27;s mother was associated with the Brooklyn mafia and she took custody of Little Jack.

When Herbert Huncke was released from prison on parole Little Jack&#x27;s family set him up with a job in an ornamental glass company in Manhattan near 23rd Street. Allen, initially, refused to see Huncke upon release on the advice of Allen&#x27;s psychiatrist.

== Writing career ==

Huncke himself was a natural storyteller, a unique character with a paradoxically honest take on life. Later, after the formation of the so-called Beat Generation, members of the Beats encouraged Huncke to publish his notebook writings (&quot;Huncke&#x27;s Journal&quot;), which he did with limited success in 1965 with Diane DiPrima&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Press. Huncke used the word &quot;Beat&quot; to describe someone living with no money and few prospects. &quot;Beat to my socks,&quot; he said. Huncke coined the phrase in a conversation with Jack Kerouac, who was interested in how their generation would be remembered. &quot;I&#x27;m beat,&quot; was Huncke&#x27;s reply, meaning tired and beat to his socks. Kerouac used the term to describe an entire generation. Jack Kerouac later insisted that &quot;Beat&quot; was derived from beatification, to be supremely happy. However, it is thought that this definition was a defense of the beat way of life, which was frowned upon and offended many American sensibilities.

Huncke&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;Guilty of Everything&quot;, was recorded by sociolgist Michael Agar in the early 1970s in R&#x27;lene Dahlberg&#x27;s Third Avenue Apartment. The transcript of these recordings were edited by Roger Goodman, head of the English Department at Stuvesant High School and Paul Metcalf (grandson of Herman Melville). Portions of the manuscript was edited again by Raymond Foye&#x27;s Hanuman Books (1987) and Don Kennison for Paragon Press (1990). A complete transcript of the Huncke/Agar recordings has not been found. Several of the tapes still exist while others have been lost or misplaced.

In 1991, Herbert Huncke was crowned King of the Beaux Arts Ball. He presided with Queen Fay Wray.

Huncke died in 1996 at age 81. He had been living for several years in a basement apartment on East 7th Street near Avenue D in New York City, supported financially by his friends. In his last few years, he lived in the Chelsea Hotel, where his rent came from financial support from Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead, whom Huncke never met.

== Quotes on Huncke ==
Jack Kerouac described Huncke in his &quot;Now it&#x27;s Jazz&quot; reading from &quot;Desolation Angels&quot;, chapter 77:

Huck, whom you&#x27;ll see on Times Square, somnolent and alert, sad, sweet, dark, holy. Just out of jail. Martyred. Tortured by sidewalks, starved for sex and companionship, open to anything, ready to introduce a new world with a shrug.

John Clellon Holmes described Albert Ancke, his representation of Huncke in &quot;Go&quot; in Chapter 14 of part 2:

A sallow, wrinkled little hustler, hatless and occupying a crumpled sport shirt as though crouched in it to hide his withered body.

Admired by David Wojnarowicz in his personal diaries, &quot;In the Shadow of the American Dream&quot;, where their meetings/dates are documented.

Frank McCourt mentions knowing Huncke in Chapter 16 of &quot;Teacher Man&quot;:

Alcohol is not his habit but he&#x27;ll kindly allow you to buy him a drink at Montero&#x27;s. His voice is deep, gentle and musical. He never forgets his manners and you&#x27;d rarely think of him as Huncke the Junkie. He respects law and obeys none of it.

== Huncke in film ==

Huncke was featured in several documentaries about the Beat generation, including Janet Forman&#x27;s &quot;The Beat Generation: An American Dream,&quot; Richard Lerner and Lewis MacAdams&#x27; &quot;What Happened to Kerouac?&quot;, John Antonelli&#x27;s &quot;Kerouac, the Movie&quot;, and Howard Brookner&#x27;s documentary about William Burroughs, &quot;Burroughs&quot;. He also starred in his only acting role in &quot;The Burning Ghat&quot; by James Rasin and Jerome Poynton.

<text>Catherine Ann &quot;Cate&quot; Archer, codenamed The Fox, is a player character and the protagonist in the &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; video game series by Monolith Productions. Cate, a covert operative for British-based counter-terrorism organization UNITY, is the main character in &quot;The Operative: No One Lives Forever&quot; (2000) and &quot;No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.&#x27;s Way&quot; (2002), and is also featured in &quot;Contract J.A.C.K.&quot;, an official prequel to the second game.

==Conception and design==
The in-game model of Cate Archer was styled after model and actress Mitzi Martin. This was a marketing decision made by the publisher, Fox Interactive, which used its feature film casting department to look for an appropriate model internationally. Archer&#x27;s voice was provided by American voice actress Kit Harris, who also did the voice of the Inge Wagner character. Originally, Harris recorded the Scottish protagonist&#x27;s voice in a stronger Scottish accent. This was changed after a Scottish producer of the game felt that the particular accent used was too lower class, and an inappropriate choice; Harris re-recorded her lines with a &quot;British bent&quot; instead.

In the game&#x27;s sequel, Archer&#x27;s face was changed to more closely resemble English model and actress Jean Shrimpton. Voice acting was done by American actress Jen Taylor, who also voiced Isako and the ninjas.

==Appearances==
Archer is the only playable character in the series&#x27; main games, &quot;The Operative: No One Lives Forever&quot; and &quot;No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy In H.A.R.M.&#x27;s Way&quot;. In the latter, there is a cooperative multiplayer level in which the player is a UNITY agent rescuing Archer while she is unconscious. She also makes a short appearance (as a non-player character) and is a playable multiplayer character in &quot;Contract J.A.C.K.&quot;

Cate Archer was born in Scotland in late March 1942 to a privileged English-Scottish family. Her mother died soon after she was born and her father committed suicide in 1956. Prior to joining UNITY, Archer pursued a career as a professional thief to provide for herself and because she found it gratifying. She was discovered by agent Bruno Lawrie when Archer stole his watch that had an in-built tracking device. By the time she arrived at her flat, Lawrie was waiting there. Admiring her talent and bravery, he decided to give her a future as an operative for UNITY - an international agency charged with combating terrorism around the globe.

Before the First H.A.R.M Incident, Archer mainly dealt with minor assignments. She was not completely satisfied with her career at UNITY, since she thought that there was no real value in her daily work. Also, she was the first female operative of UNITY, so nobody (except Bruno) believed in her. In September 1967, seven active UNITY field operatives were killed by Dmitrij Volkov, a mysterious assassin, who always left a red lily upon his victim. All traces pointed to a terrorist organization called H.A.R.M. This emergency situation forced the organization to call upon Archer to undertake her first major assignment. She and Bruno Lawrie went to Morocco, thereby beginning the chain of events which unfold in the first game. Their missions were foiled one after another, as if someone knew about their plans, yet she survived all the time. Mr. Smith didn&#x27;t trust her, which was even furthered by his sexism. However, Mr. Jones gave her last chance. In the end of the first game Archer killed two primary antagonists: Baroness Dumas and Dmitrij Volkov (who would turn to be alive), and also exposed the traitors within UNITY. By the time the incident was resolved, she had gained the respect of her superiors and colleagues, and came to be regarded as one of UNITY&#x27;s top field agents.

==Reception==
In 2007, Cate was included by Tom&#x27;s Games on the list of the 50 greatest female characters in video game history (&quot;As a delightfully retro 1960s British agent, Archer is the female equivalent of James Bond. She&#x27;s irresistibly sexy, stubbornly headstrong and proficient with all sorts of Bond-like gadgets&quot;). That same year, Cate was ranked sixth in ActionTrip&#x27;s list of top &quot;video game chicks&quot;, and the site&#x27;s writer stated: &quot;Apart from being one of most attractive game heroines out there, she&#x27;s the female equivalent of James Bond and not many chicks can stand up to that. She&#x27;s sexy and there&#x27;s simply nothing she can&#x27;t handle.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Play&quot; listed her as one of their favorite female characters in their sixth &quot;Girls of Gaming&quot; issue, stating she&#x27;s &quot;as badass as Bourne and as suave as Bond,&quot; while noting their desire to see her return in another title. That same year, she was ranked as 25th on GameDaily&#x27;s list of &quot;hottest game babes&quot; list, cited as attractive despite her conservative attire compared to other female characters, and third in UGO.com&#x27;s list of &quot;girls of gaming&quot;, compared to Emma Peel and called a female counterpart to Bond in terms of appeal. She was one of the characters featured in UGO&#x27;s 2008 list of top 11 spies in all media, stating she &quot;perfectly captures the swinging spy style&quot;. In 2009, this &quot;smart, tough heroine&quot; was one of the 64 characters chosen for the GameSpot&#x27;s poll for the All Time Greatest Game Hero, but lost in the first round against Strider Hiryu. In 2011, GamesRadar named her &quot;Miss 2000&quot; in their article on the sexiest new characters of the decade. Tom&#x27;s Guide included this &quot;smooth operator&quot; on their 2013 list of the 20 &quot;hottest video game babes&quot; for making &quot;international espionage classy and sexy all at once.&quot; In a 2021 article Collider said Archer was &quot;a wonder of a character, with a razor-sharp wit and a wardrobe to match.&quot;

<doc id="1193665" wikidata="Q1149034" url="?curid=1193665" title="TOP Oss">
<text>TOP Oss (), is a professional association football club based in the town of Oss, North Brabant, Netherlands, that competes in the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of the Dutch football league system. Founded in 1928 as T.O.P., a Dutch abbreviation for Tot Ons Plezier (English translation: &quot;To our pleasure&quot;), the team plays its home matches at the Frans Heesen Stadion, where it has been based since 1946.

The club&#x27;s history includes numerous promotions and relegations, and some spells of sustained success. It has perhaps been most prominent since the early 1990s, where the club established itself in the second-tier of Dutch football. TOP Oss have a rivalry with nearby club FC Den Bosch.

==History==

===Early years (1928–1939)===
According to sources, Toon Steinhauser and the brothers Piet and Cor van Schijndel always played football in Oss on Jurgensplein, a central square, after school. On 9 April 1928, they decided to found a club named &quot;Klein Maar Dapper&quot; (K.M.D.; English: &quot;Small But Brave&quot;), but when it turned out that more clubs had that name, the choice fell on T.O.P. (&quot;To Our Pleasure&quot;). On 7 May 1930, T.O.P. played its first competition match, on a field on the Molenstraat, behind Hotel van Welten and next to the local cinema. The pitch was a bare, uneven surface, covered with sand with an occasional tuft of grass. During home games, the goal posts were picked up from bakery Toontje van Bergen, then located in the Nieuwe Brouwerstraat. T.O.P. had two teams in the 1930–31 season both competing in the local division &quot;1e Klas Maasbuurt&quot;. The first team reached promotion to the Derde Klasse of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), where it remained for the coming years.

T.O.P. won its first title in 1939, in the Derde Klasse E. Thereby, the club qualified for playoffs to promotion to the Tweede Klasse, where they had to face SV Nevelo from Oisterwijk and Hero from Breda. Both teams had already qualified and promotion became a fact.

===The dark 1940s===
With World War II looming, the Dutch army seized the then home ground of T.O.P., Gemeentelijk Sportpark Oss, in September 1939. At the end of August 1939, the threat of war in Europe became ever greater and on 28 August, the Dutch government announced the general mobilisation of army and fleet. Because many footballers between the ages of 20 and 35 were also mobilised and train connections were disrupted, the KNVB decided to postpone the competition matches scheduled for 3 and 10 September. The KNVB took the decision on 9 September 1939 to establish a &quot;Noodcompetitie&quot; (&quot;Emergency Competition&quot;) to replace the regular competition. In the &quot;Noodcompetitie&quot;, teams were classified by geography rather than strength, there was no promotion and relegation, and no protests over referees&#x27; decisions could be filed. The season started on 24 September, a week later than the regular season had been planned to start. T.O.P. was in the Tweede Klasse B, where they, among others, played SC Helmondia, VVV and RKVV Wilhelmina. The competition ended after only few games when the German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. The competition came to a standstill for several weeks, but was resumed at the end of May. Daily life was, however, disrupted, but under pressure from the German occupying forces, life had to appear as &#x27;normal&#x27; as possible.

After state of emergency was declared in the Netherlands by the German occupiers on Dolle Dinsdag on 5 September 1944, the KNVB decided to stop all competitions. The years 1940–45 also marked a tragic period for T.O.P., as two of their players, Pince van der Aa and Hugo Brinkman, were permanently disabled during acts of war.

An ambiguous situation emerged in the Netherlands in September 1944, as the southern provinces were liberated, including Oss on 27 September 1944. While the rest of the country was still at war, allied soldiers played a benefit match on 14 October 1944 against a combined association football team from Oss. The site of the memorable match is the Gemeentelijk Sportpark Oss on the Berghemseweg, which had been seized by German soldiers as part of the occupation in 1939. The Royal Air Force team consisted of: Spencer (goalkeeper), Dauber, Spiking, Percival, Waddell, Shepherd, Martin, Levy, Phillips, Conve and Taylor. The proceeds of the competition were approximately ƒ 3,300 and which went to war victims from Oss.

Another war became the centre of attention after the liberation in 1945. On 28 September 1947, T.O.P. play a benefit against the team &quot;De rest van Oss&quot; with the final result 2–2. The proceeds went to Dutch soldiers in the Dutch East Indies. The match was organized by the organisation &quot;Nederland-Indië en Katholiek Thuisfront M.O.O. Oss&quot;.

===Winning the Tweede Klasse (1949–1953)===
For many years, T.O.P. played at the top of the Tweede Klasse, competing for the championship. Spirits were therefore high in 1949, when the title was finally won in the Tweede Klasse A. The decisive match was played on 30 January 1949, where T.O.P. played a home match on the Heescheweg against its biggest rivals at the time, VV DESK from Kaatsheuvel. In front of a sold-out stadium, with an average of 2,500 spectators during that season, the T.O.P. team lived up to its high expectations and beat DESK 2–0 to secure the title. Head coach Janus Spijkers was, however, unable to repeat the feat in the play-offs for promotion that followed. The Tweede Klasse A championship did not result in promotion to the Eerste Klasse.

===First years of professionalism (1954–1957)===
In the 1950s, TOP finished most seasons in the top half of the table. The board had a positive outlook on the future, and when the KNVB started to choose clubs for a professional football competition, club management applied for a professional license as they did not want to lag begind other football clubs in the Brabant province. Therefore, as of the 1955–56 season, TOP took part in the professional competitions of the KNVB. In its first year as a semi-professional club, TOP competed in the Eerste Klasse C (first division). The stadium on the Heescheweg had uncovered stands with mostly terracing. Professional football in the Netherlands was randomly divided into four first divisions with about 80 clubs. In the debut 1955–56 season, TOP managed to win five out of thirty games, while they drew five and lost twenty, hauling in only fifteen points. VV Zwartemeer, however, did even worse and TOP ended in the penultimate spot. TOP suffered relegation in its first season in the new league, alongside UVS from Leiden and DHC from Delft. Despite local interest in the first season, with more than 5,000 spectators in average, the transition to professionalism was not an initial success.

Ahead of the 1956–57 season, KNVB competitions were divided into the one top-tier Eredivisie, one second-tier Eerste Divisie and two third-tier Tweede Divisie. TOP compete the 1956–57 season in the Tweede Divisie B group. Once again, the club had to fight a relegation battle, and only managed to win three out of 28 matches against VV ONA from Gouda, VV De Valk from Valkenswaard and NEC Nijmegen. TOP would draw the short straw, and finish last in the group, with a goal difference of 42–90. After two inglorious seasons of professionalism, the club finally decided voluntarily to return to the Tweede Klasse of amateur football. Thereby, TOP became the first of the initial eighty professional clubs to return its license to the KNVB. Jan Huinink, who was the centre-back of the team in the semi-professional years, later stated: &quot;It was not easy. TOP was a small club that had great difficulty in finding sponsors. In fact, this is still the case today.&quot;

===Return to professionalism (1991–1999)===
After decades of amateurism, ideas of a return to professionalism began brooding in Oss in the early 1990s. Market research showed, that there was sufficient public support for a professional setup. The KNVB also supported the transition to the professional Eerste Divisie because all conditions, both sporting and financial, could be met. The board was able to convince the club members that TOP wanted to make the step forward to professional football – again – and on a general assembly a vote confirmed TOP as a professional club once again.

The club&#x27;s official return to professionalism dates to 17 August 1991, where TOP played its first match away against SC Heerenveen. Piet Schrijvers was the first-team coach, and Peter Wubben entered the historical annals by scoring the first goal for the club in its return to league football. Under head coaches Schrijvers (1992–93), Hans Dorjee (1994–95) en Lex Schoenmaker (1997–98), TOP finished in the top half of the Eerste Divisie table. The club would go under the name &quot;TOP&quot; until 1994, when it was renamed TOP Oss to more clearly reflect its city of origin.

===Ups and downs in the Eerste Divisie (2000–2010)===
The first decade of the new millennium is marked by varying successes. The first season with Wim van Zwam at the helm ended in a respectable 10th-place finish. Stefan Jansen crowned himself as top goalscorer of the 2000–01 Eerste Divisie with 30 goals to his name. The following season evolves in dramatic fashion, as TOP Oss concede 100 goals and finish bottom of the table, and a major cleanup of the squad ensues. However, due to there being no relegation from the second-tier at the time, TOP Oss suffer no consequences of the embarrassing season. Harry van den Ham took over as the new head coach afterwards, and led the team to ninth place in the league table.

The glory years only really kick off as Hans de Koning is appointed as the clubs&#x27;s new head coach in 2005. The former goalkeeper leads TOP Oss to two &quot;period titles&quot; and the team qualifies for &quot;Nacompetitie&quot; (promotion play-offs) three times in five years. De Koning forged a successful team based on local talents from Oss, such as Bart van Hintum, Erik Quekel, Tony de Groot and Regilio Jacobs. In the club&#x27;s 25th anniversary of professional football, fans voted De Koning as TOP Oss&#x27; Best Coach since 1991.

In the summer of 2009, the club was renamed FC Oss in order to separate the professional branch of the club from its amateur section. Ten months later, the club experienced a historical low point. After an intense relegation battle with Telstar and Fortuna Sittard, FC Oss suffered relegation to the Topklasse by losing the final match 5–1 to MVV Maastricht. Thereby, they became the first club to relegate to the third level of Dutch football in more than forty years, after the KNVB had reformed the league structure to merge professional and amateur football leagues.

===Third division champions and a record year (2011–present)=== 
Following the disastrous relegation, Dirk Heesen is promoted from assistant to head coach and given the task of leading the club back to the Eerste Divisie. A strong 2010–11 season, with only one loss to JVC Cuijk (2–1), meant that the club won the 2010–11 Topklasse &quot;Sunday Group&quot;. In the decisive match, FC Oss beat Achilles&#x27;29 2–0 after goals from Jean Black and Geoffrey Galatà. Oss then lost the championship game for the entire Topklasse title against IJsselmeervogels from the &quot;Saturday Group&quot; 0–4 on aggregate. However, IJsselmeervogels had already decided to deny promotion due to financial reasons and a desire to continue as an amateur club, which meant that FC Oss had secured promotion prior to the championship game.

After the return to the Eerste Divisie, FC Oss alternate good seasons with bad season. Under head coach Dirk Heesen (2011–12) the team plays spectacular football, and score many goals. With Anton Janssen (2012–13) and Klaas Wels (2017–18) as head coaches, Oss compete for a place in the post-season play-offs for large parts of the season, but miss out in the end. With Wil Boessen at the helm, however, the team managed to qualify for promotion play-offs, because on 27 February 2015, they win the third period title. With key players such as Kevin van Veen, Johnatan Opoku, Luuk Koopmans, Justin Mathieu and Ryan Sanusi, Oss finishes the season in ninth place.

In November 2017, it was announced that the club would be renamed TOP Oss for the 2018–19 season. The season would also prove to become the best historical season in club history. Many club records were broken in the 2018–19 season. TOP Oss never finished as high in the league table (6th); never had the finished with as many points (62); and never had the team won as many games (18). Under head coach Wels, the TOP Oss team were, however, eliminated in the second round of the promotion play-offs by Sparta Rotterdam (5–0 on aggregate). The following season (2019–20 season) was unstable. In the KNVB Cup, the Round of 16 was reached via, among others, a local derby against third Derde Divisie side Oss &#x27;20. In the round of 16, AZ was the opponent at home in the Frans Heesen Stadion. In the league, results were mixed. However, the season was cut short due to the measures taken to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. TOP Oss finished in a creditable 10th place in the Eerste Divisie in the 2020–21 season. In the spring of 2021, the club announced that the expiring contract of head coach Wels would not be extended. He was succeeded by Belgian manager Bob Peeters, manager of Westerlo. In addition, Ruben Roosken and Philippe Rommens both moved to Eredivisie clubs. After a disappointing season, Peeters was dismissed and Kristof Aelbrecht was brought in as his replacement.

<text>Celina Jaitly (born 24 November 1981) is an Indian actress and beauty pageant titleholder. She mainly works in Hindi cinema. She won the title of Femina Miss India 2001 and became 4th runner-up at Miss Universe 2001. She made her acting debut with the 2003 thriller &quot;Janasheen&quot;.

== Early life ==
Celina Jaitly was born in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India to a Punjabi Hindu father, Colonel V. K. Jaitly and a third-generation Afghan Hindu mother, Meeta who was a nurse in the Indian Army. 

She wanted to grow up and join the army just like her father, either as a pilot or a doctor. Most of her childhood was spent in different locations due to her father being transferred in cities and towns all over India – as a result she ended up studying in over a dozen different schools. She attended City Montessori School, Station Road, Lucknow and Canossa Convent School, Ranikhet while her family was in respective cities. She graduated with a degree in Commerce with Accountancy (Hons.) from IGNOU (Khallikote College study centre) while her stay in Brahmapur, Odisha. Her mother taught in the DePaul School there. After graduation, Jaitly worked in a cell phone company in Kolkata, West Bengal briefly as a marketing executive. The family is now settled in Mhow.

== Career ==

=== 2001–04: Debut and setback ===
Jaitly started her career with a marketing job in a mobile phone company in Kolkata before she decided to participate in a local beauty contest. She won the title at Femina Miss India 2001. She also won the Miss Margo Beautiful Skin, Indiatimes Surfer&#x27;s Choice, and &quot;MTV&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; award. She was subsequently sent to the Miss Universe 2001 contest representing India where she finished 4th runner-up.

In 2001, she featured in Jazzy B&#x27;s music video of &quot;Oh Kehri&quot;, which was immensely popular. She also featured in music videos for Bombay Vikings.

In 2003, she made her film debut in Feroz Khan&#x27;s &quot;Janasheen&quot;. The movie was a moderate box office success in India. For her second release, she had a starring role opposite Sunny Deol in the romantic action &quot;Khel&quot;, but the feature was poorly received and earned little at the box office.

In 2004, Jaitly turned down the lead role in &quot;Julie&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Stardust&quot;, Jaitly commented: &quot;I turned down Julie because I didn&#x27;t agree with the reasoning of the protagonist in the story, who resorts to prostitution because her man ditches her. I didn&#x27;t see why any educated girl would take such a drastic step. I take up roles that I mentally agree with, and this was not such a role&quot;. The same years Celina appeared in the Telugu drama &quot;Suryam&quot; opposite Vishnu Manchu.

=== 2005–08: Professional expansion ===
By 2005, under the direction of Khalid Mohamed, Jaitly played the role of Preeti, an air hostess, in &quot;Silsiilay&quot;. The movie was well received by critics.

<text>ExoMars (Exobiology on Mars) is an astrobiology programme of the European Space Agency (ESA).

The goals of ExoMars are to search for signs of past life on Mars, investigate how the Martian water and geochemical environment varies, investigate atmospheric trace gases and their sources and, by doing so, demonstrate the technologies for a future Mars sample-return mission.

The first part of the programme is a mission launched in 2016 that placed the Trace Gas Orbiter into Mars orbit and released the &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM lander. The orbiter is operational but the lander crashed on the planet&#x27;s surface. The second part of the programme was planned to launch in July 2020, when the &quot;Kazachok&quot; lander would have delivered the &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover on the surface, supporting a science mission that was expected to last into 2022 or beyond. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that the second mission was being delayed to 2022 as a result of problems with the parachutes, which could not be resolved in time for the launch window.

The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and a test stationary lander called &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; were launched on 14 March 2016. TGO entered Mars orbit on 19 October 2016 and proceeded to map the sources of methane () and other trace gases present in the Martian atmosphere that could be evidence for possible biological or geological activity. The TGO features four instruments and will also act as a communications relay satellite. The &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; experimental lander separated from TGO on 16 October and was maneuvered to land in Meridiani Planum, but it crashed on the surface of Mars. The landing was designed to test new key technologies to safely deliver the subsequent rover mission.

In June 2023, a Roscosmos lander named &quot;Kazachok&quot; (&quot;little Cossack&quot;, referring to a folk dance), was due to deliver the ESA &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover to the Martian surface. The rover would also include some Roscosmos built instruments. The second mission operations and communications would have been led by ALTEC&#x27;s Rover Control Centre in Italy.

On 17 March 2022, ESA suspended the mission due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia. ESA expects that a restart of the mission, using a new non-Russian landing platform, is unlikely to launch before 2028. As of April 2024, the mission has received new funding to restart construction and delivery of the Rosalind Franklin rover and NASA has agreed to provide the launch, currently scheduled for late 2028.

== History ==
Since its inception, ExoMars has gone through several phases of planning with various proposals for landers, orbiters, launch vehicles, and international cooperation planning, such as the defunct 2009 Mars Exploration Joint Initiative (MEJI) with the United States.
Originally, the ExoMars concept consisted of a large robotic rover being part of ESA&#x27;s Aurora Programme as a &quot;Flagship mission&quot; and was approved by the European Space Agency ministers in December 2005. Originally conceived as a rover with a stationary ground station, ExoMars was planned to launch in 2011 aboard a Russian Soyuz Fregat rocket.

ExoMars began in 2001 as part of the ESA Aurora program for the human exploration of Mars. That initial vision called for rover in 2009 and later a Mars sample-return mission. Another mission intended to support the Aurora program is a Phobos sample return mission. In December 2005, the different nations composing the ESA gave approval to the Aurora program and to ExoMars. Aurora is an optional program and each state is allowed to decide which part of the program they want to be involved in and to what extent (e.g. how much funds they want to put into the program). The Aurora program was initiated in 2002 with support of twelve nations: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada

In 2007, Canadian-based technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) was selected for a one-million-euro contract with EADS Astrium of Britain to design and build a prototype Mars rover chassis for the European Space Agency. Astrium was also contracted to design the final rover.

In July 2009 NASA and ESA signed the Mars Exploration Joint Initiative, which proposed to utilise an Atlas rocket launcher instead of a Soyuz, which significantly altered the technical and financial setting of the ExoMars mission. On 19 June, when the rover was still planned to piggyback the Mars Trace Gas Orbiter, it was reported that a prospective agreement would require that ExoMars lose enough weight to fit aboard the Atlas launch vehicle with a NASA orbiter.

Then the mission was combined with other projects to a multi-spacecraft mission divided over two Atlas V-launches: the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) was merged into the project, piggybacking a stationary meteorological lander slated for launch in January 2016. It was also proposed to include a second rover, the MAX-C.

In August 2009 it was announced that the Russian Federal Space Agency (now Roscosmos) and ESA had signed a contract that included cooperation on two Mars exploration projects: Russia&#x27;s Fobos-Grunt project and ESA&#x27;s ExoMars. Specifically, ESA secured a Russian Proton rocket as a &quot;backup launcher&quot; for the ExoMars rover, which would include Russian-made parts.

On 17 December 2009, the ESA governments gave their final approval to a two-part Mars exploration mission to be conducted with NASA, confirming their commitment to spend €850 million ($1.23 billion) on missions in 2016 and 2018.

In April 2011, because of a budgeting crisis, a proposal was announced to cancel the accompanying MAX-C rover, and fly only one rover in 2018 that would be larger than either of the vehicles in the paired concept. One suggestion was that the new vehicle would be built in Europe and carry a mix of European and U.S. instruments. NASA would provide the rocket to deliver it to Mars and provide the sky crane landing system. Despite the proposed reorganisation, the goals of the 2018 mission opportunity would have stayed broadly the same.

Under the FY2013 Budget President Obama released on 13 February 2012, NASA terminated its participation in ExoMars due to budgetary cuts in order to pay for the cost overruns of the James Webb Space Telescope. With NASA&#x27;s funding for this project completely cancelled, most of these plans had to be restructured.

On 14 March 2013, representatives of the ESA and the Russian space agency (Roscosmos), signed a deal in which Russia became a full partner. Roscosmos would supply both missions with Proton launch vehicles with Briz-M upper stages and launch services, as well as an additional entry, descent and landing module for the rover mission in 2018. Under the agreement, Roscosmos was granted three asking conditions:
# Roscosmos would contribute two Proton launch vehicles as payment for the partnership.
# The Trace Gas Orbiter payload shall include two Russian instruments that were originally developed for Fobos-Grunt.
# All scientific results must be intellectual property of the European Space Agency and the Russian Academy of Sciences (i.e. Roscosmos would have been be part of all the project teams and would have had full access to research data).

ESA had originally cost-capped the ExoMars projects at €1 billion, (USD 1.3 billion) but the withdrawal of the U.S. space agency (NASA) and the consequent reorganisation of the venturesy added several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised. So in March 2012, member states instructed the agency&#x27;s executive to look at how this shortfall could be made up. One possibility was that other science activities within ESA may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority. In September 2012 it was announced that new ESA members, Poland and Romania, would be contributing up to €70 million to the ExoMars mission. ESA has not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.

Russia&#x27;s financing of ExoMars was to be partially covered by insurance payments of 1.2 billion roubles (US$40.7 million) for the loss of Fobos-Grunt, and reassigning funds for a possible coordination between the Mars-NET and ExoMars projects. On 25 January 2013, Roscosmos fully funded the development of the scientific instruments to be flown on the first launch, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).

By March 2014, the lead builder of the ExoMars rover, the British division of Airbus Defence and Space, had started procuring critical components, but the 2018 rover mission was still short by more than 100 million euros, or $138 million. The wheels and suspension system are paid by the Canadian Space Agency and are being manufactured by MDA Corporation in Canada.

=== 2016 first spacecraft launch ===
The spacecraft containing ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; launched on 14 March 2016 09:31 UTC (Livestream began at 08:30 GMT [03:30 AM EDT]). Four rocket burns occurred in the following 10 hours before the descent module and orbiter were released. Signals from the Orbiter were successfully received at 21:29 GMT of the same day, which confirmed that the launch was fully successful and that the spacecraft was on its way to Mars. Shortly after separation from the probes, the Briz-M upper booster stage possibly exploded a few kilometers away, however apparently without damaging the orbiter or lander. The spacecraft, which housed the Trace Gas Orbiter and the &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; lander, took its nominal orbit towards Mars and was seemingly in working order. Over the next two weeks, controllers continued to check and commission its systems, including the power, communications, startrackers, and guidance and navigation system.

=== Delays and suspension ===

In January 2016 it was announced that the financial situation of the 2018 mission &#x27;might&#x27; require a 2-year delay. Italy is the largest contributor to ExoMars, and the UK is the mission&#x27;s second-largest financial backer.

The rover was scheduled to launch in 2018 and land on Mars in early 2019, but in May 2016 ESA announced that the launch would occur in 2020 due to delays in European and Russian industrial activities and deliveries of the scientific payload.

On 12 March 2020, it was announced that the second mission was being delayed to launch in 2022 due to the vehicle not being ready for launch in 2020, with delays exacerbated by travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 28 February 2022, it was announced that the second mission launching in 2022 &quot;was very unlikely&quot; due to the sanctions on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

On 17 March 2022, the launch of ExoMars in the 2022 launch window was abandoned, with the permanent suspension of the partnership with Roscosmos. However, in November, the European Space Agency member states pledged 360 million euros towards the Rosalind Franklin rover, including covering the cost of replacing Russian components. Now planned to launch in 2028, the rover will carry a next-generation mass spectrometer, the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer, or MOMA.

In June 2024, a $567 million contract was awarded to Thales Alenia Space to complete the assembly, integration, and testing of the landing platform, with mechanical, thermal, and propulsion handled by Airbus Defense and Space, and ArianeGroup providing the heat shield. On 16 April 2024, ESA announced a memorandum of understanding with NASA to provide the launch service in late 2028, and that the next mission milestone is the preliminary design review in June 2024.
== Mission objectives ==
The scientific objectives, in order of priority, are:
* to search for possible biosignatures of past Martian life.
* to characterise the water and geochemical distribution as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface.
* to study the surface environment and identify hazards to future human missions to Mars.
* to investigate the planet&#x27;s subsurface and deep interior to better understand the evolution and habitability of Mars.
* achieve incremental steps ultimately culminating in a sample return flight.

The technological objectives to develop are:
* landing of large payloads on Mars.
* to exploit solar electric power on the surface of Mars.
* to access the subsurface with a drill able to collect samples down to a depth of 
* to develop surface exploration capability using a rover.

== Mission profile ==

ExoMars is a joint programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). According to current plans, the ExoMars project will comprise one orbiter (the Trace Gas Orbiter) and one rover.

The landing module and the rover will be cleaned and sterilised to prevent contaminating Mars with Earth life forms, and also to ensure that any biomolecules detected were not carried from Earth. Cleaning will require a combination of sterilising methods, including ionising radiation, UV radiation, and chemicals such as ethyl and isopropyl alcohol. (see Planetary protection).

=== First launch (2016) ===

==== Trace Gas Orbiter ====
The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars telecommunications orbiter and atmospheric gas analyzer mission that was launched on 14 March 2016 09:31 UTC. The spacecraft arrived in the Martian orbit in October 2016. It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of methane on Mars and other gases, and in doing so, will help select the landing site for the ExoMars rover to be launched in 2022. The presence of methane in Mars&#x27;s atmosphere is intriguing because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon the arrival of the rover in 2023, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the ExoMars rover with a telecommunication relay. NASA provided an &quot;Electra&quot; telecommunications relay and navigation instrument to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth. The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.

==== &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM lander ====

The Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module (EDM) called &quot;Schiaparelli&quot;, was intended to provide the European Space Agency (ESA) and Russia&#x27;s Roscosmos with the technology for landing on the surface of Mars. It was launched together with the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) on 14 March 2016, 09:31 UTC and was scheduled to land softly on 19 October 2016. No signal indicating a successful landing was received, and on 21 October 2016 NASA released a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter image showing what appears to be the lander crash site. The lander was equipped with a non-rechargeable electric battery with enough power for four sols. The soft landing should have taken place on Meridiani Planum during the dust storm season, which would have provided a unique chance to characterise a dust-laden atmosphere during entry and descent, and to conduct surface measurements associated with a dust-rich environment.

Once on the surface, it was to measure the wind speed and direction, humidity, pressure and surface temperature, and determine the transparency of the atmosphere. It carried a surface payload, based on the proposed meteorological DREAMS (Dust Characterisation, Risk Assessment, and Environment Analyser on the Martian Surface) package, consists of a suite of sensors to measure the wind speed and direction (MetWind), humidity (MetHumi), pressure (MetBaro), surface temperature (MarsTem), the transparency of the atmosphere (Optical Depth Sensor; ODS), and atmospheric electrification (Atmospheric Radiation and Electricity Sensor; MicroARES). The DREAMS payload was to function for 2 or 3 days as an environmental station for the duration of the EDM surface mission after landing.

=== Second launch (2028) ===

The ExoMars 2022 mission was planned for launch during a twelve-day launch window starting on 20 September 2022, and scheduled to land on Mars on 10 June 2023. It would have included a German-built cruise stage and Russian descent module. On 28 February 2022, the ESA announced that, as a result of sanctions related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a 2022 launch is &quot;very unlikely.&quot; On 28 March 2022, the ExoMars rover was confirmed to be technically ready for launch, but the 2022 launch window for the mission is no longer possible due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The launch of a revised version of the mission, using a new non-Russian landing platform, is expected to occur no earlier than 2028. In 2022, US announced participation and said to provide the lander and 40 Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs) are also kept reserved for this mission.

==== Cruise stage ====

The lander and Rosalind Franklin rover will be sent to Mars inside the descent module. The descent module will be attached to the carrier module, which will provide power, propulsion, and navigation. The carrier module has 16 hydrazine powered thrusters, 6 solar arrays that will provide electricity, Sun sensors and star trackers for navigation. It was developed and built by OHB System in Bremen, Germany. The carrier module will separate from the descent module right before the stacked spacecraft arrives at Mars.

==== Descent stage ====

Prior to the cancellation of ESA-Roscosmos cooperation on ExoMars, the original plan was to use the Russian&quot;-&quot;built &quot;Kazachok,&quot; which the ESA cooperated on. Originally, &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; would descent from the &quot;Kazachok&quot; lander via a ramp. The lander was expected to image the landing site, monitor the climate, investigate the atmosphere, analyse the radiation environment, study the distribution of any subsurface water at the landing site, and perform geophysical investigations of the internal structure of Mars. Following a March 2015 request for the contribution of scientific instruments for the landing system, there will be 13 instruments. Examples of the instruments on the lander include the HABIT (HabitAbility: Brine, Irradiation and Temperature) package, the METEO meteorological package, the MAIGRET magnetometer, and the LaRa (Lander Radioscience) experiment. The stationary lander was expected to operate for at least one Earth year, and its instruments would have been powered by solar arrays.

Following the July 2022 cancellation, ESA has begun work on their own lander, which is expected to take 3 to 4 years to build and qualify. Many components of the ESA lander are reused from the Russian Descent module. Unlike &quot;Kazachok&quot;, the European lander does not carry solar panels nor science instruments, and is expected to only operate for a few sols.

==== &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover ====

ExoMars&#x27;s &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover was due to land in June 2023 and to navigate autonomously across the Martian surface. However, the partnership with Russian scientists was cancelled in 2022 as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began that year. &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; is now projected to launch in 2028.

Instrumentation would consist of the exobiology laboratory suite, known as &quot;Pasteur analytical laboratory&quot; to look for signs of biomolecules and biosignatures from past life. Among other instruments, the rover will also carry a sub-surface core drill to pull up samples for its on-board laboratory. They will have a mass of about .

The &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; rover includes the Pasteur instrument suite, including the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA), MicrOmega-IR, and the Raman Laser Spectrometer (RLS). Examples of external instruments on the rover include:
*Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies
*Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars
*ADRON-RM

== Landing site selection ==
A primary goal when selecting the rover&#x27;s landing site is to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support —now or in the past— microbial life. The scientists prefer a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple hydrated minerals such as clay minerals is preferred, but it will come down to a balance between engineering constraints and scientific goals.

Engineering constraints call for a flat landing site in a latitude band straddling the equator that is only 30° latitude from top to bottom because the rover is solar-powered and will need best sunlight exposure. The landing module carrying the rover will have a landing ellipse that measures about 105 km by 15 km.
Scientific requirements include landing in an area with 3.6 billion years old sedimentary rocks that are a record of the past wet habitable environment. The year before launch, the European Space Agency will make the final decision. By March 2014, the long list was:

* Aram Dorsum
* Coogoon Valles
* Hypanis Vallis
* Mawrth Vallis
* Oxia Planum
* Simud Valles
* Southern Isidis

Following additional review by an ESA-appointed panel, four sites, all of which are located relatively near the equator, were formally recommended in October 2014 for further detailed analysis:

* Aram Dorsum
* Hypanis Vallis
* Mawrth Vallis
* Oxia Planum

On 21 October 2015, Oxia Planum was reported to be the preferred landing site for the ExoMars rover.

The delay of the rover mission to 2020 from 2018 meant that Oxia Planum was no longer the only favourable landing site due to changes in the possible landing ellipse. Both Mawrth Vallis and Aram Dorsum, surviving candidates from the previous selection, could be reconsidered. ESA convened further workshops to re-evaluate the three remaining options and in March 2017 selected two sites to study in detail.

* Mawrth Vallis
* Oxia Planum

On 9 November 2018, ESA announced that Oxia Planum was favoured by the Landing Site Selection Working Group. The favored Oxia Planum landing ellipse is situated at 18.20°N, 335.45°E. In 2019, Oxia Planum was confirmed by ESA as the landing site for the planned 2020 mission. Later that year, a flyover video of the landing site was released, created using high-accuracy 3D models of the terrain obtained from HiRISE.

As of July 2020, it has not been stated by ESA if the choice of landing site will be affected by the delay of the mission beyond 2022, similar to the re-evaluation prompted by the first delay in 2018.

<text>Mahima Chaudhry (born Ritu Chaudhry; 13 September 1973), is an Indian actress who primarily works in Hindi films. Chaudhry did a few modelling assignments and television commercials before venturing into films, with the 1997 romantic drama film &quot;Pardes&quot;, for which she received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.

She played the leading lady in several films, including &quot;Daag&quot; (1999), &quot;Dhadkan&quot; (2000), and &quot;Kurukshetra&quot; (2000), and received critical recognition for her performances in &quot;Dil Kya Kare&quot; (1999), &quot;Lajja&quot; (2001) and &quot;Dobara&quot; (2004), earning nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Dil Kya Kare&quot; and &quot;Dhadkan&quot;.

==Early life==
Mahima was born as Ritu Chaudhry to a Jat father from Baghpat District of Uttar Pradesh and a Nepalese-origin mother in Darjeeling, India. She attended Dow Hill in Kurseong until class 10 and later moved to Loreto Convent, Darjeeling. Having grown up in the Darjeeling Hills region, she is fluent in both Hindi and Nepalese languages. She won the ‘Miss Darjeeling’ title in a local beauty contest.

Prior to her first release &quot;Pardes&quot;, she changed her name to Mahima Chaudhry upon the recommendation by her director Subhash Ghai, who believed the letter &#x27;M&#x27; to be lucky for leading actresses in his films.

==Career==
Chaudhry started her career as a video jockey. She made her acting debut with &quot;Pardes&quot;, in 1997. Chaudhry played a village girl opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The film was a major commercial success worldwide. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut along with nomination for Best Actress.

Chaudhry&#x27;s other roles were in &quot;&quot; (1999), where she played a dual role; in &quot;Pyaar Koi Khel Nahin&quot; (1999) she played a widow forced to marry her brother-in-law; in &quot;Dhadkan&quot; (2000) she is a loving friend of a man who is madly in love with another woman: in &quot;Deewane&quot; she plays a singer in love with a thief: in &quot;Kurukshetra&quot; she plays the stubborn wife of a police officer: in &quot;Lajja&quot; she plays a young bride forced to fight dowry; in &quot;Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar&quot; (2001) she plays a stubborn tenant who will not give up her home at any cost; in &quot;Om Jai Jagadish&quot; she is the loving homemaker; in &quot;Dil Hai Tumhaara&quot; (2002) she is the sister who would do anything for her sister&#x27;s happiness; in &quot;Dobara&quot; she is the frustrated housewife; in &quot;The Film&quot; she is a desperate struggling screenwriter; in &quot;&quot; she is a paralytic dancer, in &quot;Film Star&quot; she is an uptight arrogant fading actress; in &quot;Home Delivery&quot; (2005) she is a South Indian superstar; and in &quot;&quot; (2006) she plays a desperate housewife who has an affair with her stepdaughter&#x27;s boyfriend.

In 2010, Chaudhry starred in a Knightsbridge Media Production film, &quot;Pusher&quot;, directed by Assad Raja. She also worked in the thriller &quot;Mumbhaii - The Gangster&quot;, co-starring Om Puri and Sanjay Kapoor.

==Political activities==
In the 2021 West Bengal elections, Chaudhry campaigned for some candidates from both Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Trinamool Congress. In 2023, there was speculation of her joining the BJP ahead of the Madhya Pradesh elections, as she met the state Minister, Vishvas Sarang, and hailed the BJP government.

In 2024, Chaudhry came out in support of Prime Minister Modi, calling him an inspirational figure under whom India&#x27;s respect has increased in the world.

==Personal life==
In 1999, while shooting for &quot;Dil Kya Kare&quot;, Chaudhry was involved in a car crash; her car rammed into a truck in Bangalore and multiple pieces of glass had to be removed from her face as a result of the accident.

Chaudhry married Bobby Mukherji in 2006. Their daughter was born in 2007, and the couple separated in 2013.

Chaudhry was diagnosed and successfully treated for breast cancer in 2022. She mentioned that comedy shows such as &quot;Kapil Sharma Show&quot; helped her during her recovery from illness.

<text>Binkp is a protocol for transferring FidoNet or WWIVNet mail over reliable connections. It is typically used to deliver mail over the internet, instead of point-to-point connections between modems.

==Application==
Historically, FidoNet traffic was transferred mainly over serial (RS-232) modem connections which might not have an error correction layer. These dial-up-oriented protocols for transferring FidoNet traffic like EMSI or ZMODEM had to implement error-recovery. When the members of FidoNet started to use TCP/IP to transfer FidoNet traffic, this error-recovery overhead became unnecessary. Assuming that the connection is reliable makes it possible to eliminate error-checking and unnecessary synchronization steps, achieving both ease of implementation and improved performance. The major advantage of binkp vs EMSI and ZMODEM is achieved over connections with large delays and low bandwidth.

IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has registered the port number 24554 for binkp when used over TCP/IP connections.

== History ==
*In 1996, Dima Maloff released the first draft of the protocol specification and the first mailer, binkd, that supported the new protocol.
*In 1997, Argus mailer began to support the binkp protocol.
*In 1999, Dima Maloff, Nick Soveiko and Maxim Masiutin submitted the protocol specification to the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee (FTSC), which published the document as Fidonet Standards Proposal (FSP-1011).
*In 2005, FTSC assigned the Fidonet Technical Standard (FTS) status to the binkp protocol, and split the specification into four separate documents: Binkp/1.0 Protocol specification (FTS-1026 ), Binkp/1.0 optional protocol extension CRAM (FTS-1027), Binkp protocol extension Non-reliable Mode (FTS-1028), and Binkp optional protocol extension Dataframe Compression (FTS-1029).
*On October 2, 2015, WWIV BBS&#x27;s WWIVnet implemented a binkp backbone for its network.

<doc id="1193690" wikidata="Q2432362" url="?curid=1193690" title="Florida State Road 9B">
<text>State Road 9B (SR 9B) is a state highway on the south side of Jacksonville, Florida. It is a freeway for its entire length. Its southern terminus is at County Road 2209 (CR 2209) in St. Johns County. Its northern terminus is at the southeast-most point on Interstate 295 (I-295). The highway is planned to be redesignated as Interstate 795 (I-795) when the designation is approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).

==Route description==
State Road 9B begins at an interchange with Saint Johns Parkway (County Road 2209) in St. Johns, heading north as a four-lane divided highway. The road heads through Peyton Parkway (Race Track Road Connector) and Interstate 95 before expanding as a six lane expressway. The road continues north for where it passes over Phillips Highway (US 1). The road then continues north for another where it terminates at an interchange with Interstate 295.

==History==

In May 2008 the project was suspended by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) but it was reinstated in 2010 when funding was acquired via stimulus funds.

===Phase 1===
Phase 1 of the SR 9B/I-795 project, consisting of a spur from the Eastern Beltway of I-295 to US 1, began in the middle of 2010 and was scheduled to be completed in early of 2013, at an estimated cost of $68.5 million. The winning contract went to Archer Western Contractors / GAI Consultants, who also reconstructed the I-10/I-95 interchange in downtown Jacksonville. The roadway was originally planned to open in the end of 2012, but was pushed back to 2013 to allow for the construction of a wider paved area to facilitate future expansion. In late July 2013, southbound I-295 was closed a few nights to install new overhead signs for the SR 9B interchange, one of the final construction projects of Phase 1. Phase 1 opened September 19, 2013.

===Phase 2===
Superior Construction and Arcadis US was awarded a $95 million design-build contract for the second phase of SR 9B, from US 1 to I-95. Construction began in April 2013 and was fully completed on June 13, 2016. Phase 2 includes a new four-lane road between US 1 and I-95. The Phase 1 interchange at US 1 is upgraded with additional exit ramps and an overpass over US 1 and Veveras Drive in addition to utility work along US 1. A cloverstack interchange at I-95 was constructed, along with noise walls in the northwest and southeast corners.

===Phase 3===
Phase 3 consisted of extending State Road 9B south of the Interstate 95 interchange. The third and final phase connected I-95 to County Road 2209 and Race Track Road via a connector road (named Peyton Parkway) in St. Johns County. Construction began on September 9, 2015 and opened to traffic on August 9, 2018.
==Exit list==

Although exit numbers on SR 9B increase from north to south, this table presents interchanges from south to north to follow FDOT milepost measurements starting at St. John’s Parkway.

Mettur can be divided into upper and lower Mettur based on whether the part of the town lies upstream or downstream of the river.

Mettur, meaning &quot;town with crests and troughs&quot;, obtained its name from the undulating rocky nature of the land that makes the town an ideal place for the dam on Cauvery river.

Mettur is located at border of the Erode, Salem, and Dharmapuri districts, and is approximately one and half hours travel-distance by road from the district headquarters.

Palamalai (&quot;malai&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot; in Tamil language) is an offshoot of the Eastern Ghats, geographically contiguous with the BR hills Biligiriranga Hills range as they reach out to merge with the Western Ghats at Nilgiris.

The town houses the Stanley Reservoir, which is a standing example of British stone masonry, and the dam. The reservoir capacity touches 120 feet when full, and can rise a few feet beyond its full capacity during surplus seasons.

The town is hemmed to a narrow strip of less than a kilometre in width by the Cauvery let out by the Dam on the east, and Eli Karadu (Mouse hill) on the west. This forms an interesting pattern of three similar peaks with identical longer shoulders to their left, increasing in height from the Dam&#x27;s crest level about a from sea level in the north to about peak in the Palamalai.

===Stanley Reservoir===
Mettur Dam, which forms Stanley Reservoir, is constructed across the Kaveri River in Tamil Nadu. It was constructed in 1934 and took 9 years to complete. Maximum height and width of the Dam are 214 and 171 feet respectively. Maximum storage height is 120 feet. Mettur Dam receives the water from both Kabini Dam and Krishna Raja Sagara Dam located in Karnataka. There are 2 hydroelectric power stations in Mettur Dam, the first constructed during British rule and the second during the Indian Republic. There is a park at the base of the dam called Ellis Park maintained by the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department.

===Electrical power===
Mettur is one of the sources of electricity for Tamil Nadu. It has thermal and hydroelectric power stations.

The 840-megawatt thermal power station acts as one of the base load power plants for Tamil Nadu each. A new power station has also been constructed with a capacity of 600 megawatts.

There are two hydroelectric power stations at Mettur, called Dam and Tunnel Power Houses, respectively. Dam Power House has a capacity of 40 MW, and Tunnel Power House has a capacity of 200 MW.

An important one is chemical manufacturing: Mettur Chemicals (now known as Chemplast), (not only that there are more) has four large plants manufacturing chemicals, soaps, and industrial gases. MALCO, one of the main aluminium producers, runs a famous matriculation and higher secondary school. SISCOL (Southern Iron and Steel Company Limited, now a part of Jindal groups (JSW Steel Ltd)) is a new addition to the region though it is located at Pottaneri, from Mettur and from Salem, the district headquarters. SAIL&#x27;s Salem Steel plant is nearby. High-grade granite is quarried in the Eli Karadu Hills.

Mettur is also called the &quot;Aluminium city of Tamil Nadu&quot;. Its aluminium plant, operated by MALCO, has its own bauxite mines at Yercaud (Salem district) and Kolli Hills (Namakkal district). The company is one of five integrated primary aluminium producers in India, with an alumina refinery capacity of 55,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) and an aluminium smelter capacity of 29,500 tpa.

=== Industrial pollution ===

Mettur&#x27;s industrial development has taken a heavy toll on many parts of its farming and fishing communities. However, despite protest from both international groups such as Greenpeace and local groups such as West Gonur Farmers&#x27; Association or SpeakOut Salem!, the local authorities have failed to bring the problems under control.

Recent tests undertaken by Dr. Ruth Stringer and Dr. Mark Chernaik of ELAW-US (an Oregon-based environmental laboratory) revealed high levels of contamination. From nine samples taken from around the plants run by Chemplast and MALCO, there were 17 chemicals were found to be at levels significantly above USEPA &#x27;safe&#x27; levels.

== Culture/Cityscape ==
Villagers in Mettur celebrate the Mariamman festival during the summer vacation time (May) and lasts for an entire week.

The Aadi Perukku festival is celebrated every year on 18th day of Tamil month Adi. 


== Transport ==
=== By Air ===

The nearest airport is Salem Airport, which has daily flights to Chennai.
=== By Rail ===

There is a railway station located near the upper part of Mettur Dam that connects to Salem. From the station there is also a daily express train to and from Salem

=== By Road ===
Mettur, being close to the transportation hubs of Erode and Salem, is well connected to both these cities as well as to Dharmapuri. Bus services operate from Erode and Salem at the high frequency, with bus services typically once every 5 minutes. There is a shortcut for Coimbatore from Dharmapuri via Thoppur, Mettur, Bhavani (which can save up to travel) without reaching Salem by NH47 due to the high volume of traffic between Coimbatore and Salem, especially between Coimbatore and Avinashi on NH47. There is also a route to Mysuru-Karnataka through Madeswaran Malai (madeswaran Betta) and Kollegal from Mettur.

<text>Atheist Rap is a Serbian punk rock band from Novi Sad, formed in 1989, which has released six studio albums, one compilation album and one live DVD. Their music is often characterized as &quot;fun punk&quot; due to its cheerful music and vocals. Their lyrics are usually critical of society and politics and are often humorous accounts of everyday events.

== History ==

=== 1980s ===
The idea of forming Atheist Rap came to vocalists Aleksandar Popov (also known as Dr. Pop) and Vladimir Kozbašić (also known as Pećinko) at the Rambo Amadeus concert, which took place on 29 November 1988, at the local club Mašinac. They merged with members of Fluorel Tatchkash, Vladimir Radusinović (also known as Radule) on guitar and Zoran Zarić (also known as Zare) on bass, and Stevan Gojkov (also knowns as Goja) (from Kapetan Leshi, Fear Of Dog, A Better Life Zine) took hold of the drums. The first live appearance was just a few days after the band was officially formed, at the Petrovaradin Fortress gate called &quot;Beogradska kapija&quot; on 22 May 1989, with several local acts. Before the appearance,with the repertoire consisting of two songs, the whole band wrote the song &quot;O.R.A.&quot;, which was performed by Popov on vocals, Kozbašić on backing vocals, with the band improvising to the lyrics. The performance provided the band a cult status, despite not having any recordings released. The band also got invitations to perform at several Novi Sad clubs, while writing new material. At the time, the band had rehearsals and partially lived at the &quot;Žuta Kuća&quot; in Novi Sad, until it was bulldozed by the local authorities.

=== 1990s ===
In January 1990, the band performed at the alternative music festival called Bolje uživo nego u mrtvo (&quot;Better Live Than Dead&quot;), and made first recordings in June 1990, but the beginning of the Yugoslav wars at the beginning of the 1990s stopped the band from releasing the first CD release in the region. It was a four-song EP, recorded at the &quot;Barba&quot; studio in Bukovac, entitled &quot;Compact Disc&quot;, consisting of the songs &quot;Gusti sok&quot;, &quot;Stomak eliminator&quot;, &quot;Novosadski vašar&quot; and &quot;Gril 13&quot;, that Croatian label Jugoton never put out of press, and, as a result, the material was never released in this format. One of the songs from the EP, &quot;Gusti sok&quot;, appeared on the various artists compilation &quot;Novi Sad Vol. 2&quot;. The EP was also to be released by the Novi Sad record label Start Today Records. Despite the EP not being released, the band promoted the recordings through radio and television broadcasts, which increased their popularity. At the end of 1990, Flourel Tatchkash and Elba drummer Aleksandar Milanov &quot;Atzke&quot; joined the group with Gojkov switching to guitar, and the new lineup had the first live appearance at the KUD Sonja Marinković.

It was at the insisting of Tetcha Morales (manager, guitar) and Voja Žugić (Scorned Records, Three Pals Zine) that the band recorded their debut album &quot;Maori i Crni Gonzales&quot; (&quot;Māori and Black Gonzales&quot;), recorded at the Do-Re-Mi Studio in Novi Sad by the end of 1992, and released it in 1993. Despite the humorous lyrics of the songs &quot;Ljubav&quot;, featuring the sampled speech of Josip Broz Tito, &quot;Wartburg limuzina&quot;, &quot;Blu Trabant&quot; and &quot;Plitka poezija&quot;, named after the first Pekinška patka album, and a mixture of cover versions by Pekinška Patka), the album had low official but pretty high pirate release sale. However, the band received the Album of the Year Award at the Brzi Bendovi Srbije festival. The band also occasionally performed under pseudonymous names Božidara Starog Park and Električni Jurica. &quot;Wartburg limuzina&quot; and &quot;Blu Trabant&quot; became hits in Serbia and Republic of Macedonia. The latter appeared on the American compilation &quot;Delite the Elite&quot;, featuring bands from the USA and Europe (MDC, Negu Gorriak, Credit to the Nation and Chumbawamba, Clawfinger...). &quot;Maori i Crni Gonzales&quot; was re-released by Take It Or Leave It Records in 1994, and again in 1996 by the same record label, featuring four bonus tracks from the never released EP &quot;Compact Disc&quot;. The album also featured live versions of &quot;Ljubav&quot;, &quot;ORA je pravi način da...&quot; (YWA Is the Real Way To...&quot;) and &quot;Ritam&quot;. Despite the political and economic situation in the country, the band presented the release at live performances in major cities and all around Serbia.

By the time the band released their second studio album &quot;Ja eventualno bih ako njega eliminišete&quot; (&quot;I Possibly Would if You Eliminate Him&quot;), released in 1995 through PGP-RTS, guitarist Gojkov had already left the band. The album was named by an acronym &quot;Jebanje&quot; (&quot;Fucking&quot;). The band&#x27;s lyrical style was based on the rap dialectics backed with heavy punk rock riffs crossed with rockabilly and ska elements. The lyrics for the songs featured quotations from acts such as Kićo Slabinac, KUD Idijoti, Ekatarina Velika, The Clash and Soundgarden. Between the songs, the band inserted recordings from the &quot;Nacionalna klasa&quot; movie and sampled speech sections. The album was produced by the band themselves with Vojislav Aralica.

A series of successful concerts in Serbia, Republic of Macedonia and Republika Srpska, which followed the release of the album, had been stopped by the illness of Zarić, who soon after died of lymfoma cancer on 14 February 1997. He was replaced by Zoran Lekić &quot;Leki&quot;, who previously worked with Ove Sezone Vedri Tonovi, Telegram Sam, Naučnici, Luna, La Strada, Obojeni Program, Love Hunters, Plavi Ptičić Prepeličić, and worked with the group after the release of &quot;Ja eventualno bih ako njega eliminišete&quot; in 1995. The band set off on a previously arranged tour of Slovenia and, having returned, started working a new album, entitled &quot;Druga liga zapad&quot;, released by Hi-Fi Centar. The album, produced by Marinko Vukmanović, featured cover versions of Paraf song &quot;Narodna pjesma&quot; and miniatures &quot;Atheist Rap II&quot; and &quot;Atheist hor&quot; (&quot;Atheist Choir&quot;), dedicated to the deceased bassist Zarić.

In the meantime, Hi-Fi Centar re-released the band&#x27;s second album on CD. The band also appeared on the various artists compilation &quot;Punk You All&quot; with a cover version of Paraf &quot;Narodna pjesma&quot; and Dead Kennedys &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot;, released by Hi-Fi Centar in 1998, and recorded live at KST in Belgrade on 26 October 1996. During 1998, the band performed at the Gitarijada festival in Zaječar with a new member, guitarist Slobodan Fekete &quot;Barbun&quot;, and in autumn, with KUD Idijoti, Goblini and Sikter, the band performed in Sarajevo at the ruined hall of the city train station.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000 the band took part in the campaign &quot;Vreme je... Izađi na crtu&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s Time... Get Out There&quot;) whose aim was to motivate the people to vote against Slobodan Milošević on the upcoming elections. On October of the same year band went on a Croatian tour, playing at Močvara (Zagreb), Uljanik (Pula) and Palah (Rijeka). The following year the band released the compilation &quot;Predsednici Predsedništva Predsednika&quot; (&quot;Presidents of the Presidency of the Presidents&quot;), which featured a newly recorded version of the song &quot;Sarajevo&quot;, and a new song &quot;Lopovi i žace&quot; (&quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;).

The compilation album release was followed by absence of concert activities as Kozbašić and Fekete left the band and Radusinović started playing bass in Bonebreaker. Fekete was replaced by Dušan Ječmenica &quot;Dulles&quot;, who played in bands KNO, Mitesers, Out Of Control, Bonebreaker, Generacija Bez Budućnosti and Boye. The new lineup of the band recorded their fifth album, &quot;Osveta Crnog Gonzalesa&quot; (&quot;Revenge of Black Gonzales&quot;), released through Multimedia Records in 2005. The album was recorded and produced by the band themselves. The album featured new songs &quot;Pritilend&quot;, &quot;Bluz južne pruge&quot;, &quot;Elit luk i voda&quot; and the previously released song &quot;Lopovi i žace&quot;. In the meantime, the band performed at several festivals, including Nisomnia in Niš, EXIT 03 in Novi Sad and Zagreb Open-Air.

By the end of March 2005, the band started touring, performing at about thirty concerts, including the performances at the Split Gripe arena and the concerts at NS Time club. In 2006, the band appeared in the Jovan Đerić documentary about Novi Sad punk rock scene, &quot;Bilo jednom...&quot;. During the same year, Atheist Rap appeared on the Pankrti tribute album &quot;Pankrti 06&quot; with the cover of the song &quot;Modro nebo&quot;, Ljubiša Georgijević tribute album, with the song &quot;Delfin&quot;, and the Novi Sad Student&#x27;s Cultural Center compilation &quot;Novosadska punk verzija 1978–2005&quot; (&quot;Novi Sad Punk Version 1978–2005&quot;) with the song &quot;Atheist Rap&quot; recorded at their first live act. The following year, the band performed at the Exit festival and released a DVD featuring a live performance the band held at KST in Belgrade and promotional videos for the tracks &quot;Pritilend&quot;, &quot;Igraš grubo&quot;, &quot;Dve žetve godišnje&quot; and &quot;Audio Pula Video Split&quot;. In 2007, the band performed at the Niš Beer Fest and the following year at the Belgrade Beer Fest and Alternative Rock festival in Belgrade.

In 2009, the band started a 20th anniversary tour, performing at various venues, including the 6 June performance in Novi Sad, where as guest appeared Canadian actor Rob Stewart. Stewart, having heard the about the popularity of his former TV show &quot;Tropical Heat&quot; had in Serbia and being a symbol of the students&#x27; protests in 1996 and 1997, came to Serbia. Stewart appeared as guest on the band&#x27;s song &quot;Slaughteru Nietzsche&quot; (from the album &quot;II liga zapad&quot;) dedicated to him.

The band released their fifth studio album &quot;Priče matorih pokvarenjaka&quot; on 30 November, in two formats, the MP3 version, available for free download at the band and the Serbian Converse official site, and a limited edition CD released by SKC Novi Sad, featuring four bonus tracks. During the first twenty four hours, the album was downloaded in 7500 copies.

In March 2013, the band members, together with the members of Dubioza Kolektiv and Hladno Pivo, recorded a cover of KUD Idijoti song &quot;Ja sjećam se&quot; (&quot;I Remember&quot;) as a tribute to deceased KUD Idijoti frontman, Brako Črnac &quot;Tusta&quot;. The song was released on Dubioza Kolektiv album &quot;Apsurdistan&quot;. In May, the band appeared on the tribute album to the band Brkovi entitled &quot;Brkati gosti&quot; with a cover of Brkovi song &quot;Usamljen-oženjen&quot;. At the end of 2013, the documentary &quot;Slaughter Nick for President&quot;, dealing with popularity of &quot;Tropical Heat&quot; in Serbia and featuring the band was released.

In autumn of 2014, the band participated in a tribute album to Novembar, entitled &quot;Tako mlad i tako čist&quot; (&quot;So Young and So Clean&quot;), with a cover of Novembar song &quot;Ko je sunce ubio?&quot; (&quot;Who Killed the Sun?&quot;).

<text>The A500 is a major primary A road in Staffordshire and Cheshire, England. It is dual carriageway for most of its length and connects Nantwich, junctions 16 and 15 of the M6 motorway with the city of Stoke-on-Trent. It is long.

The road was built to provide links between Stoke-on-Trent and the M6, before being extended to Nantwich. Construction has taken place over several stages, beginning in 1962, with the final section of the original route being completed similar to the original plans in 2006. As a trunk road, the section between junction 15 and 16 of the M6 is maintained by the Highways Agency whilst the section past junction 16 is maintained by Cheshire East council. In 2004, the road was stated as carrying 60,000 vehicles a day through Stoke.

It is known locally as the &quot;D-Road&quot; or &quot;Potteries D-Road&quot;, after its configuration. The originally planned route of the road joins junctions 15 and 16 of the M6 in a &#x27;D&#x27; shape, and was represented in the logo used by the Corporation of Stoke when promoting the road. D is also the Roman numeral representing the number 500, the number assigned to the completed road.

==History==
By the 1960s, traffic congestion was a major problem in Stoke-on-Trent, and journeys across the area sometimes took hours. There was no connection from the newly constructed M6 to the city. Businesses in the area wanted an easier route to get their goods out of the area.

As early as 1961 the route of the road scheme – already known as the &quot;Potteries D Road&quot; – was included in the Staffordshire Development Plan for planning purposes.

The A500 was initially built from the M6 at junction 16 to the A34 road at Talke as part of the motorway construction, opening in 1962. At the southern end, a dual carriageway was constructed from junction 15 of the M6 to the A34 near Trentham, given the number A5006, and opened at the same time. The northern section of the road was then subsequently extended from Talke to the A53 road. The final section from the A34 in the south to the A53 junction was built between 1974 and 1977. The two middle junctions were to be grade separated, but due to financial constraints they were built as roundabouts. Construction involved the destruction of streets and businesses within Stoke&#x27;s town centre, as well as the excavation of a mass grave of the victims of a 17th-century cholera epidemic. This final section was named Queensway, and on its completion the whole route became the A500.
The route remained unchanged until the 1980s when the Hanford Roundabout junction had a flyover built, as this was a major bottleneck for both the A500 and A34. The 1977 section east of this junction had been built with provision for the bridge, but the section built as the A5006 required realignment for the new interchange. In the late 1980s the road was extended from Junction 16 close to Weston with connections provided to existing roads to Keele and Crewe. The A52, which at that time ran to Nantwich, was renumbered from Newcastle to Weston as a B road and the section from Weston to Nantwich was incorporated into the A500. In 1989 a bypass to the east of Nantwich was opened, extending the A500 from the south of Nantwich to its current northerly terminus with the A51.

In 1993 a proposal was made to add the missing flyover and underpass close to Stoke-on-Trent railway station, after an alternative plan had been rejected because of its cost. A full review of the national roads programme resulted in the suspension of that scheme however. In 1997 the A50 was rerouted through Stoke-on-Trent to meet the A500 at Sideway, where a new grade separated roundabout was constructed.

On the approach to Hough was a narrow single lane bridge which was added to with a Bailey bridge in 1993. In September 2003, the Shavington bypass opened to reroute the road away from three villages on the former A52 section. This was built to dual carriageway standards with provision for further junctions to new development sites.

Traffic continued to rise to the point where major congestion was experienced on the central section. Work began on 16 February 2004 on the A500 Pathfinder Project to replace the final two roundabouts in Stoke with underpasses. The Highways Agency defined the pathfinder project as involving &quot;a new form of contract and co-operative working methods to deliver a better value project, faster.&quot; The project involved alterations to the path of the Trent and Mersey Canal and River Trent, along with new provisions for pedestrians. The work was carried out by Edmund Nuttall Limited and was planned to be completed in spring 2006. Following a number of delays for which it was rumoured the construction company was being fined up to £100,000 a day for not keeping to schedule, the road opened on Tuesday 26 September 2006, with the southbound traffic in the morning and northbound traffic in the afternoon. Several months of additional work was needed to finalise traffic light operations, gardens, and other miscellaneous tasks.

In February 2009, it was announced that the single carriageway Nantwich bypass would be re-numbered as the A51 in a bid to relieve the town centre of traffic.

In 2015, the final 500m of the eastbound single carriageway between Weston and Junction 16 of the M6 was upgraded. This included resignalling works on the roundabout in order to relieve congestion at the roundabout.

==Route==

The road is the primary access route for traffic to and from almost all areas of Stoke-on-Trent. Starting to the east of Nantwich on the Nantwich bypass the dual carriageway Shavington bypass running north of Hough and Shavington. Returning to the 1980s single carriageway extension route it continues east through a cutting to the M6 at Junction 16 where it becomes a dual carriageway. Continuing through open countryside it passes under the A34 at Talke Pits, turns south before meeting the Tunstall Western Bypass and enters the north of Stoke-on-Trent. Now continuing in an urban setting it runs between Newcastle and Burslem, passing through the middle of the former Wolstanton Colliery before running east of Stoke&#x27;s town centre. Passing through the newest section in a cutting it emerges south of Stoke alongside the site of the Victoria Ground. Turning west it passes the Bet365 Stadium before leaving the urban area at Hanford, south of Trent Vale. It then runs through a cutting before meeting the M6 at junction 15.

<text>George Ambrose Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd, (19 September 1879 – 4 February 1941) was a British Conservative politician and colonial administrator who was strongly associated with the &quot;Diehard&quot; wing of the party. From 1937 to 1941, he was chairman of the British Council in which capacity he sought to ensure support for Britain&#x27;s position during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Lloyd was born at Olton Hall, Warwickshire, the son of Sampson Samuel Lloyd (whose namesake father was also a Member of Parliament) and Jane Emilia, daughter of Thomas Lloyd. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He coxed the Cambridge crew in the 1899 and 1900 Boat Races. He left without taking a degree, wad unsettled by the deaths of both his parents in 1899 and made a tour of India.
In 1901, Lloyd joined the family firm Stewarts &amp; Lloyds as its youngest director. In 1903, he first became involved with the tariff reform movement of Joseph Chamberlain. In 1904, he fell in love with Lady Constance Knox, daughter of the 5th Earl of Ranfurly, who forbade the match with his daughter considering him unsuitable (she then married Evelyn Milnes Gaskell, son of the Right Honourable Charles Gaskell, in November 1905). In 1905, he turned down an offer by Stewarts &amp; Lloyds of a steady position in London and chose to embark on a study of the East in the British Empire.

===Foreign Office===
Through the efforts of his friends Samuel Pepys Cockerell, working in the commercial department of the Foreign Office, and Gertrude Bell, whom he had come to know, he started work as an unpaid honorary attaché in Constantinople. At &quot;Old Stamboul&quot;, as he came to remember the Embassy of Sir Nicholas O&#x27;Conor, he worked together with Laurence Oliphant, Percy Loraine and Alexander Cadogan. There also, he first met Mark Sykes and Aubrey Herbert. In April 1906, Herbert joined him on an exploration of the state of the Baghdad Railway. His confidential memorandum of November 1906 on the Hejaz Railway gave a detailed account of many economic problems. That and other papers on Ottoman finance, for example, led to his appointment in January 1907 as a special commissioner to investigate trading prospects around the Persian Gulf.

===Parliamentary candidate===
Lloyd had been strongly influenced by Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s call for tariff reform to link Britain and the dominions closer together, and the tariff issue now inspired Lloyd to enter politics. At the January 1910 general election, Lloyd was elected as a Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for West Staffordshire. He married Blanche Lascelles the following year. In February 1914, Lloyd was adopted as Unionist parliamentary candidate for Shrewsbury ahead of the next general election (expected no later than the end of 1915) when the sitting MP, the unrelated namesake George Butler Lloyd, intended to retire. Lloyd was completely opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage and wrote that to give women the right to vote would ensure that they would vote &quot;for the &quot;beaux yeux&quot; of the candidates&quot;.

The general election and his candidacy were both forestalled by the outbreak of the First World War, and the sitting member continued to hold his seat until 1922. He and another backbench colleague in Parliament, Leopold Amery, lobbied the Conservative leadership to press for an immediate declaration of war against Germany on 1 August 1914.

In conjunction with Edward Wood (later Earl of Halifax), Lloyd wrote &quot;The Great Opportunity&quot; in 1918. The book was meant to be a Conservative challenge to the Lloyd George coalition and stressed for devolution of power from Westminster and the importance of reviving English industry and agriculture.

===First World War===
As a lieutenant in the Warwickshire Yeomanry, Lloyd was called up three days after Britain had entered the war.

During the war, he served on the staff of Sir Ian Hamilton at Gallipoli and landed with the ANZACs on the first day of that campaign; took part in a special British mission to Petrograd to improve Anglo-Russian liaison; visited Basra to update his study of commerce in the Persian Gulf; and, after a time in Cairo, with T. E. Lawrence and the Arab Bureau in Hejaz, the Negev and the Sinai Desert. He reached the rank of captain in the Warwickshire Yeomanry in which regiment he continued to hold rank until 1925, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and made Companion of the Indian Empire in 1917. For services in the war, he also received the Russian Empire&#x27;s Order of St Anne, 3rd Class, and the Order of Al Nahda (2nd class) of the Kingdom of Hejaz.

==Colonial posts==
===Bombay===
In December 1918 he was appointed Governor of Bombay and made Knight Commander in the Order of the Indian Empire. His principal activities as governor were reclaiming land for housing in the Back Bay area of the city of Bombay and building the Lloyd Barrage (now Sukkur Barrage) an irrigation scheme, both of which were funded by loans raised in India, instead of in England. Lloyd&#x27;s administration was the first to raise such funds locally. His province was one of the centres of Indian nationalist unrest to deal with which he insisted in 1921 on the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi, who was subsequently imprisoned for six years for sedition.

Lloyd was very strongly opposed to Indian independence or even bringing a measure of democracy to the Raj and wrote of what he called &quot;the fundamental unsuitability of modern western democratic methods of government to any Oriental people&quot;. A strong believer in what he regarded as the greatness of the British Empire, Lloyd wrote from Bombay to a friend on 25 August 1920: &quot;The real truth is that we can&#x27;t withdraw the legions: every schoolboy knows what happened to Rome as the legions began to do so&quot;. The British historian Louise Atherton described Lloyd: &quot;Idealistically, almost mystically, devoted to the British Empire, he advocated the use of force, if necessary, to maintain British control&quot;. He completed his term as governor in 1923 and was made a Privy Counsellor and Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India.

He was instrumental in selecting and sending the first truly-Indian team of athletes to Olympics in 1920 to the 7th Olympic Games, held at Antwerp, Belgium. He helped form the ad hoc Indian Olympic Association under the chairmanship of the industrialist and philanthropist Sir Dorabji Tata. Lloyd made special arrangements for the preparations and training of the six-member team in England, arranged for their travel and stayed in military facilities both in London and then Antwerp. He negotiated the arrangements with Sir Winston Churchill and got the required permissions even when the Britain was broke from the First World War and struggling even to send its own teams to the Games. A patron of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, he also established an annual grant dedicated to its efforts in producing a critical edition of the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata.&quot;

===Egypt===
He returned to Parliament again for Eastbourne in 1924 and served until 1925, when he was made Baron Lloyd, of Dolobran in the County of Montgomery, named after his Welsh ancestral home. After his ennoblement, he was appointed High Commissioner to Egypt and served until his resignation was forced upon him by the Labour Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson in 1929. Lloyd&#x27;s views and experience formed the background of a self-justifying two-volume book, &quot;Egypt Since Cromer&quot; (published 1933–1934).

===Lobbying===
In 1930, Lloyd became president of the Navy League, which lobbied the government for to spend more money on the Royal Navy, and he was a member of the India Defence League, which lobbied the government not to grant home rule to India. During the 1930s, he was one of the most prominent opponents of proposals to grant Indian Home Rule, working alongside Winston Churchill against the National Government. From 1931 to 1935, Lloyd employed James Lees-Milne as one of his male secretaries.

Lloyd was suspicious of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement, which he saw as a threat to Britain. He agitated for rearmament against Germany as early as 1930, before Churchill did so.

==British Council==
From July 1937 onward, he was chairman of the British Council in which he oversaw an increase in lectureships and made cultural tours of neutral capitals to maintain sympathy for Britain&#x27;s cause during the early months of the Second World War.

The council was a purportedly-independent group meant to engage in cultural propaganda promoting the British way of life to the rest of the world that was in fact under the control of the Foreign Office. As head of the British Council, Lloyd ran his own private intelligence network that employed as one his spies the journalist Ian Colvin, who served as the Berlin correspondent of &quot;The News Chronicle&quot;. Unusually, Lloyd enjoyed a privileged access to the secret reports of MI6, the British intelligence service. The British historian D.C. Watt called Lloyd &quot;one of those uncontrollable &quot;lusi naturae&quot; the British elite throws up from time to time&quot;.

In November 1937, Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden instructed Lloyd that the British Council was to concentrate especially on improving Britain&#x27;s image in Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania and Poland. Regarding the Middle East, especially Egypt, as a crucial area of control for Britain, Lloyd regarded the approaches to the Near East as equally crucial, which led him to become obsessed with the Balkans, which called the &quot;eastern approaches&quot;, independently of Eden&#x27;s instructions. In April 1938, he suggested in a memo sent to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax that Britain needed to become more economically involved in the Balkans, which were rapidly falling into the German economic sphere of influence. After discussing the issue with King George II of Greece during a visit to Athens in May 1938, Lloyd submitted another memo calling for Britain to increase the import of staple goods from Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and Romania. In response, Britain granted Turkey a credit of £16 million that month, but Lloyd&#x27;s idea of an &quot;economic offensive&quot; in the Balkans was not taken up at the time.

===Czechoslovakia===
Lloyd was not in sympathy with the Chamberlain government&#x27;s policies towards Czechoslovakia in August–September 1938, and his advice that he gave to his old friend, Lord Halifax, who served as Foreign Secretary after Eden had resigned in February 1938 in protest against the Chamberlain&#x27;s government&#x27;s policies towards Fascist Italy, was not followed.

Lloyd passed on to the government on 3 August 1938 a report from Colvin that stated that Germany planned to invade Czechoslovakia on 28 September. In September, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain flew to Germany three times for summits with Hitler at Berchtesgaden, Bad Godesberg and Munich to discuss the Sudetenland crisis. In a letter of 20 October 1938 to Sir Percy Loraine, Lloyd sardonically wrote of those three summits: &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t concede, fly, fly again.&quot;

===United States===
In the tense atmosphere of 1938, Lloyd tried hard to increase British propaganda in the United States to an attempt to involve the America in the Sudetenland dispute and favored an approach of trying to appeal to the American elite, rather than the American people in general.

In June 1938, he argued that the British Council should arrange for British professors to serve as visiting lecturers at American universities to strengthen Anglo-American relations. The same month, the US Congress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which required all propaganda by foreign governments in the United States to be registered with the State Department and to be labelled as propaganda. US Representative Martin Dies Jr., the chairman of the House Committee for the Investigation of Un-American Activities (HUAC), announced his committee would be investigating British attempts to get the United States involved in European conflicts. He alleged that the only reason that the United States had declared war on Germany in 1917 was because of improper British propaganda, and he vowed his country would not be &quot;tricked&quot; again into declaring war on Germany. In response to the xenophobic mood in Congress, the British ambassador in Washington, Sir Ronald Lindsay, objected to Lloyd&#x27;s plans and wrote if the Foreign Office knew &quot;what they were at&quot;, it would know that any British Council propaganda in America would offend Congress. Even Lloyd&#x27;s plans to use the British Pavilion at the upcoming 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair to promote the British viewpoint drew objections from Lindsay that it would upset Congress. Lindsay regarded Dies as a particular problem as the congressman from Texas was known for his grandstanding style and his love of publicity, which led him to make fantastic and often-bizarre statements. As a result of Lindsay&#x27;s objections, Britain instituted a &quot;no propaganda&quot; policy in the United States, which lasted until 1940. Dies&#x27;s investigation into British propaganda in America failed to find any, which caused him to turn his attention to Hollywood, where he alleged that too many filmmakers had left-wing and therefore &quot;un-American&quot; views. Dies made headlines by announcing that he found evidence that wealthy Hollywood filmmakers (all of them Jewish) were secretly members of the US Communist Party and were smuggling in Spanish Republican soldiers disguised as illegal immigrants from Mexico with the aim of staging a communist coup, but the subsequent lack of evidence to back up those assertions discredited him.

Lloyd was forced to use a more informal approach to the United States and arranged for Americans with the power to influence American public opinion to visit Britain, where they were met by notable British personalities, who were instructed to impress them the importance of closer Anglo-American ties as a factor for world peace. The Britons recruited for this work were Sir George Schuster, the president of Lipton&#x27;s Tea; the American-born Conservative MP Ronald Tree; the Scottish aristocrat Lord Lothian, the secretary of the Rhodes Trust; the Labour MP Josiah Wedgewood; Angus Fletcher, the president of the British Library of Information; and Frank Darvall, the president of the English Speaking Union who had received his degree at Columbia University. In particular, American journalists were cultivated with the principle theme being that both countries were champions of freedom and democracy and should work together more closely for that reason. As those meetings took place in Britain with individuals who were ostensibly expressing their own personal views, and the American correspondents in their writings and broadcasts merely recorded their own experiences of Britain, that completely bypassed the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

===Balkans===
Accepting that Czechoslovakia was a lost cause after the Munich Agreement, in the autumn of 1938, Lloyd focused on convincing the government that greater British involvement was needed with the remaining two members of the Little Entente: Yugoslavia and Romania. Lloyd was especially involved with the latter, where his two principal collaborators were Grigore Gafencu and Virgil Tilea, both of whom he knew from his work with the British Council. In October 1938, Lloyd visited Bucharest to meet King Carol II.supposedly to encourage Anglo-Romanian cultural links but in fact to hear a plan from Carol for Britain to stop Romania from becoming an economic colony of Germany. Lloyd who rather liked Carol, sent a series of vigorously written telegrams from Bucharest urging for Britain to commit itself to spending £500,000 on buying Romanian oil, purchase 600,000 tons of Romanian wheat and assist Romania with building a naval base where the Danube River flowed into the Black Sea. In the cabinet meetings, Lord Halifax used Lloyd&#x27;s telegrams to argue that Britain should buy Romanian wheat and said that &quot;how urgent the matter is, and of what importance it is without delay to try and do something in the economic sphere for Romania&quot;. Chamberlain agreed with the idea, but he committed to buying only 200,000 tons of Romanian wheat after objections from the Treasury.

Lloyd, the most consistent advocate of more British support for Romania, argued to Lord Halifax that it was too dangerous to let that oil-rich kingdom fall into the German sphere of influence. Lloyd noted that Germany had no oil of its own and that there were only two places in Europe where oil could be obtained in massive quantities, the Soviet Union and Romania, and that since the latter was by far the weaker, he believed that Romania would be Hitler&#x27;s next target. In response, Halifax argued that the Germans saw Romania as being in their sphere of influence, and too great of British involvement in that kingdom would have been seen by Hitler as &quot;encirclement&quot;. When Carol visited London between 15 and 18 November 1938, Lloyd was present to argue on his behalf. Despite all of Lloyd&#x27;s advocacy of Carol&#x27;s case during his London visit, Britain agreed to buy only 200,000 tons of Romanian wheat at above world prices with an option to buy 400,000 tons but refused the king&#x27;s request for a £30 million pound loan. The Chamberlain government committed to spending £10 million in support of threatened nations in November 1938, but the bill authorising the spending was not passed until February 1939, of which the largest sum, £3 million, went to China, and in the Balkans £2 million went to Greece and £1 million to Romania.

In a letter on 24 November, he mentioned that he just returned from the Balkans &quot;to see what could be saved in the Balkans from the Nazis&quot;, an allusion to the recent tour of Balkans by German Economics Minister Dr Walther Funk, who pressed for greater economic integration of the region with the German Reich. Acting in his own capacity, Lloyd urged that the directors of the firm Spencer Limited to build grain silos in Romania, as Carol had mentioned during his visit to London that Romania&#x27;s ability to export wheat was hindered by the lack of grain silos. In January 1939, Lloyd advised Gafencu, who just been appointed Romanian Foreign Minister, to appoint someone of &quot;considerable energy and position&quot; to be the Romanian minister in London, which led to Tilea receiving the appointment. After King Carol, the Balkan leader to whom Lloyd was closest was Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia for the boy King Peter II.

Working with a fellow member of the board of the Navy League, Lord Sempill, who had served as the deputy chairman of the London Chamber of Commence in 1931–1934, Lloyd sought from January 1939 onward to encourage British businesses to buy many products from the Balkans as possible. Lord Semphill had once been an enthusiast for Nazi Germany and had joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, but he was described as being &quot;impressed by Lloyd&#x27;s propaganda efforts and wanted to back them with specific business arrangements&quot;. In February 1939, he visited Athens to meet the Greek dictator, General Ioannis Metaxas, in an effort to improve Anglo-Greek relations. In a bid to &quot;soften the dictatorship&quot;, Lloyd arranged for greater British Council involvement with the National Youth Organisation, which he believed would allow the British Council to win over Greek public opinion. During his visit to Athens, Lloyd also advised King George II to dismiss a Germanophile, Metaxas, as prime minister and to appoint an Anglophile as his successor, which the king refused. Lloyd made clear during his Greek visit his personal preference for Venizelism and met several Venizelist Greek politicians, which was also a way of expressing his distaste for the 4th of August Regime. Upon his return from Greece, Lloyd pressed very strongly for the government to force British tobacco companies to buy the Greek tobacco crop. During his visit to Greece, both King George and Mextaxas had told him that Germany had more to offer Greece economically than Britain, which led Lloyd to decide on a dramatic gesture to prove otherwise. Lloyd&#x27;s advocacy of buying the entire Greek tobacco crop for 1939 led to bureaucratic struggle, as objections were raised that it was unfair to force British smokers to use Greek tobacco, regarded as inferior, when they were used to American and Canadian tobacco, regarded as superior.

===Second World War===
On 27 January 1939, Lloyd passed on to the government a report he received from Colvin that Germany was planning to invade Poland in the spring of 1939. In March 1939, Lloyd played a major role in the &quot;Tilea affair&quot; when Tilea claimed that Romania was on the brink of a German invasion, a claim that he strongly endorsed despite the denials of Gafencu. Lloyd argued to Halifax that based upon his sources in Romania, Germany had indeed threatened an invasion, which the Romanians were denying for fear of enraging Hitler. In late March 1939, Lloyd received information from Colvin that Germany was planning on invading Poland that spring, and on 23 March, he told Colvin that he would arrange for him to meet Chamberlain and Lord Halifax. Colvin met Chamberlain and Lord Halifax on 29 March 1939, but it is not clear much credence Lloyd placed on his reports, as on 31 March, the same day that Chamberlain announced the guarantee of Poland in the House of Commons, Lloyd told Halifax that he still regarded Romania, rather than Poland, as Hitler&#x27;s probable next target.

Lloyd argued that Britain and France should co-ordinate their policies in the Balkans as the best way of deterring Germany and played a major role in ensuring the Anglo-French guarantees of Romania and Greece that were issued on 13 April 1939. After the Italians annexed Albania on 4 April 1939, there was a general consensus within the Chamberlain cabinet that Britain should guarantee Greece, but it was felt that the Romanians should commit to strengthening their alliance with Poland before Britain offered a guarantee of Romania. As the Danzig crisis was just beginning, Carol was reluctant to strengthen the Romanian alliance with Poland. When Tilea told Lloyd that Britain but not France was hesitant to guarantee Romania, Lloyd went to the French embassy. Lloyd was regarded as such an important personality that he barged in as French Ambassador Charles Corbin was on the telephone with Prime Minister Edouard Daladier. Lloyd, who was fluent in French, talked to Daladier and told him that if France held firm in ensuring the guarantees to Romania and Greece, Britain would have to follow suit. As the British government did not wish to be seen operating out of sync with the French, the news that Daladier would go ahead with the guarantee forced London&#x27;s hand. Atherton wrote about Lloyd&#x27;s actions in April 1939, &quot;The beneficiary was Romania, who received a guarantee unconditional on a closer defensive alliance with Poland, and which helped her to balance between the western powers, Germany, and Russia. In this instance, Lloyd had been working on behalf of Romania rather than Great Britain&quot;. However, Lloyd&#x27;s attempts to lobby Halifax to issue a guarantee for Yugoslavia fell flat.

Reflecting his special case in the Balkans, when Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, Lloyd had the pamphlet &quot;The British Case&quot; to explain why Britain had declared war translated into Greek, Bulgarian, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene and ensured that it was widely distributed all over the Balkans. A recurring theme of Lloyd&#x27;s letters to Halifax during the Phoney War was that the Treasury was not providing enough money for the British Council&#x27;s work in the Balkans. In September 1939, Tilea began to promote the idea of a &quot;Balkan bloc&quot;, consisting of all the Balkan state, that would be committed to upholding neutrality in the Second World War with the understanding that the Allies would come to their aid if their neutrality was violated. Lloyd, who was in close contact with Churchill who was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty on 3 September 1939, called together with Churchill for a &quot;Balkan league&quot;, which would form a line to block any German expansion into the Balkans. On 27 September 1939, Tilea asked Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Foreign Office&#x27;s Permanent Undersecretary, &quot;whether it would not be a good plan to send someone out to Bucharest, and he quoted as an example Lord Lloyd, who had the ear of the King and might be able to give good advice on the subject of Balkan reconciliation and consolidation&quot;. It is possible that Lloyd and Tilea had been working together on the same day that Tilea had asked for Lloyd to go to the Balkans. Lloyd had told Lord Halifax of his desire to go the Balkans saying &quot;the urgency of which at the present moment obviously cannot be exaggerated&quot;.

===Balkan tour===
By October 1939, it was agreed that Lloyd would visit Romania but all of the Balkan states to work for a &quot;Balkan pact&quot;. Sir Reginald Hoare, the British minister in Bucharest, was opposed to the plan to send Lloyd to the Balkans, but George William Rendel, the minister in Sofia, and Sir Michael Palairet, the minister in Athens, were supportive. In the interval, Lloyd had visited Spain to ask the Spanish dictator, General Francisco Franco, if he was willing to guarantee the proposed &quot;Balkan pact&quot;, an aspect of his visit to Madrid about which he neglected to tell the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office first learned of the plan from the Yugoslav Regent, Prince Paul, in November 1939. On 3 November 1939, Lord Halifax called a meeting to discuss the merits and demerits of the Balkan League plan, which Lloyd was allowed to attend by special permission of Halifax over the objections of Cadogan, who argued that an outsider like Lord Lloyd should be attending a Foreign Office meeting.

On 14 November 1939, Lloyd&#x27;s Balkan tour began with a visit to Bucharest. Gafencu suggested a &quot;machinery for common action&quot;, but negotiations broken down when King Carol learned that the British guarantee of Romania applied only against Germany, not the Soviet Union, as he wanted. As Carol had not seen Hoare for some time, the extended talks that Lord Lloyd had with the king was felt to provide &quot;useful information and impressions&quot;. In Belgrade and Sofia, Lloyd&#x27;s visit was hampered by inability of Britain to supply weapons on the scale that both Prince Paul of Yugoslavia and King Boris III of Bulgaria wanted. Moreover, the unwillingness of Boris to renounce Bulgarian territorial claims over Yugoslavia, Greece and Romania rendered the idea of a neutralist Balkan league impractical. After finishing his Balkan tour, Lloyd went to Syria to see Maxime Weygand, whose &quot;Armée de la Syrie&quot; had been intended by the French General Staff before the war to go to Thessaloniki.

Upon his return to Britain in December 1939, Lloyd backed French plans for a revival of the Salonika front strategy of World War II and urged at meetings of the Supreme War Council for British and French troops to land at Thessaloniki. In that, he was against the British government, which opposed the French plans for a &quot;second front&quot; in the Balkans under the grounds that it was unclear whether Italy intended to remain neutral or not. Lloyd enlisted the aid of Foreign Office officials such as Robert Bruce Lockhart who summarised his thesis: &quot;Lloyd says that the only argument in the Balkans is strength. If we do nothing we shall lose everything. If we are vigorous we have the support of the Balkans. Therefore, without too much consideration of Italy we must go ahead with the formation of the Near Eastern force&quot;. In response to objections from Sir Percy Loraine, the British ambassador in Rome, that he was not certain how long Italy would remain neutral, Lloyd argued that Britain should just ignore the possibility of Italy entering the war but start troops to Thessaloniki at once. At the same time, Lloyd advised Halifax that Britain should start shipping weapons to Yugoslavia at once to indicate that Britain was serious about defending the Balkans. In January 1940, Lloyd wrote to Loraine that Benito Mussolini respected only force and of his belief that if the Allies landed in the Balkans, that was likely to persuade Mussolini to continue Italian neutrality.

===Evaluation===
In January 1940, the attention of the Supreme War Council shifted towards Scandinavia, and the Balkan plan was abandoned. Lloyd&#x27;s major interest in February to March 1940 was in building a &quot;British Institute&quot; in Bucharest to promote British culture, who was supported by Lord Halifax against objections from the Treasury that it was a waste of money in wartime. In an assessment of Lloyd&#x27;s work in the Balkans, Atherton wrote: &quot;His position was an ambivalent one: neither a diplomat nor a politician, but a peer with a semi-official position and influential political contacts. It was also increasingly irregular, but despite his opposition to the Munich agreement and, after September 1938, to further appeasement of Germany, Chamberlain never sought his removal&quot;.

==In cabinet==
When Churchill became prime minister in May 1940, he appointed Lloyd as Secretary of State for the Colonies and in December, he conferred on Lloyd the additional job of Leader of the House of Lords.

=== London Central Mosque ===
Lord Lloyd was a leading proponent of the future London Central Mosque. As early as 1939 he worked with a Mosque Committee, comprising various prominent Muslims and ambassadors in London. After joining Churchill&#x27;s cabinet, he sent a memo to Churchill to point out that London contained &quot;more [Muslims] than any other European capital&quot; but that in the British Empire &quot;which actually contains more Moslems (&quot;sic&quot;) than Christians it was anomalous and inappropriate that there should be no central place of worship for Mussulmans [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot;. He believed the gift of a site for the mosque would serve as &quot;a tribute to the loyalty of the Moslems of the [British] Empire and would have a good effect on Arab countries of the Middle East&quot;.

==Other interests==
In commerce, Lloyd was also director of the British South Africa Company and Wagon Lit Holdings. In peacetime, he habitually travelled in tropical countries every two months.

In his fifties, he trained for and obtained a civil pilot&#x27;s certificate in 1934, and in 1937, he was appointed Honorary Air Commodore of No 600 (City of London) (Fighter) Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force with which he insisted on training himself to qualify as a military pilot.

==Personal life==
In 1911, Lloyd married Blanche Isabella Lascelles, DGStJ, daughter of the Honourable Frederick Canning Lascelles, a Royal Navy commander, and granddaughter of Henry Lascelles, 4th Earl of Harewood. Blanche was a lady-in-waiting to Alexandra of Denmark from 1905 to 1911 and to Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood (wife of Blanche&#x27;s first cousin, Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood) from 1941 to 1945.

Some in the Foreign Office had thought Lloyd was a homosexual and persisted in that view despite his marriage and the birth of his son.

==Death==
Lloyd died of myeloid leukaemia at a clinic in Marylebone, London, in February 1941, aged 61, and was buried at St Ippolyts, Hertfordshire. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Alexander. Lady Lloyd died in December 1969, aged 89.

==In popular culture==
He appears as the character &quot;Henry Fortescue&quot; in Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s novel &quot;Thin Ice&quot;.

<doc id="1193699" wikidata="Q1064438" url="?curid=1193699" title="Wallenberg family">
<text>The Wallenberg family is a prominent Swedish family renowned as bankers, industrialists, politicians, bureaucrats and diplomats, present in most large Swedish industrial groups, including EQT AB, Ericsson, Electrolux, ABB, SAS Group, SKF, Atlas Copco, Saab AB, and more. In the 1970s, the Wallenberg family businesses employed 40% of Sweden&#x27;s industrial workforce and represented 40% of the total worth of the Stockholm stock market.

The most famous of the Wallenberg family, Raoul Wallenberg, a diplomat, worked in Budapest, Hungary, during World War II to rescue Jews from the Holocaust. Between July and December 1944, he issued protective passports and housed Jews, saving tens of thousands of Jewish lives. Their flagship company, Investor AB, has a market capitalization of around $60 billion. The family is also heavily involved in philanthropy through the Wallenberg foundations, especially the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

==History==
The earliest known member of the Wallenberg family is Per Hansson (1670–1741) who, in 1692, married Kerstin Jacobsdotter Schuut (1671–1752). Their son, Jakob Persson Wallberg (1699–1758) married twice. The children of his first marriage called themselves Wallberg and those of his second called themselves Wallenberg. Jakob Persson Wallberg was the great-grandfather of André Oscar Wallenberg who, in 1856, founded Stockholms Enskilda Bank, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.

André Oscar Wallenberg&#x27;s son Knut Agathon Wallenberg took over as CEO of Stockholms Enskilda Bank in 1886.
Like many other Wallenberg relatives, Knut Agathon Wallenberg was also involved in Swedish politics and diplomacy becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs 1914–1917, and member of the Riksdags first chamber (Parliament of Sweden) 1907–1919. In 1916, new legislation made it more difficult for banks to own shares in industrial companies on a long-term basis. Investor was formed as an investment part of Stockholms Enskilda Bank.

Knut Agathon Wallenberg&#x27;s younger brother Marcus Wallenberg (senior) carried on the tradition and took over as the bank&#x27;s CEO in 1911, replacing his older brother who was appointed Stockholms Enskilda Bank chairman of the board.

Jacob Wallenberg, eldest son of Marcus Wallenberg (senior), became the bank&#x27;s CEO after Joseph Nachmanson sv died in 1927, joined by younger brother Marcus Wallenberg (junior) as the bank&#x27;s deputy CEO. In 1938, Knut Agathon Wallenberg died. He had no children. Marcus Wallenberg (senior) was appointed Stockholms Enskilda Bank chairman of the board.

During the War the Bank collaborated with the German government. The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. considered Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and the US subjected the Bank to a blockade that was only lifted in 1947.

The fourth generation of Wallenbergs joined the family business in 1953, including heir apparent Marc Wallenberg, eldest son of Marcus Wallenberg (junior), who became a deputy CEO at Stockholms Enskilda Bank in 1953, before taking over as CEO in 1958. After a power struggle between Jacob Wallenberg and his younger brother Marcus Wallenberg (junior), Jacob Wallenberg resigned from the board of directors in 1969.

The resignation opened a seat on the bank&#x27;s board of directors to Peter Wallenberg (senior), younger son of Marcus Wallenberg (junior). Marcus Wallenberg (junior) pushed through a merger agreement between Stockholms Enskilda Bank and rival Skandinaviska Banken in 1971. Soon after, tragedy struck when Marc Wallenberg committed suicide, observers suggested that the act came possibly because Marc Wallenberg felt himself inadequate to the task of leading what was to become the Scandinavia banking giant Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. The merger went through in 1972.

Marcus Wallenberg (junior), and younger son Peter Wallenberg (senior), focused their interests on the family&#x27;s investment companies, Investor and Providentia. Investor now became the family&#x27;s new flagship business, and, under Marcus Wallenberg (juniors) leadership began actively promoting the restructuring of most of the industrial companies under its control, replacing board members and promoting younger CEO and other management.

Peter Wallenberg (senior) took over after Marcus Wallenberg (junior&#x27;s) death in 1982. For many outsiders, the change in leadership marked a final moment in the family&#x27;s more than 100-year dominance of the Swedish banking and industrial sectors. Yet Peter Wallenberg (senior) rose to the challenge, guiding Investor and Sweden&#x27;s industry into a new era. In 1990, it was estimated that the family indirectly controlled one-third of the Swedish Gross National Product. Peter Wallenberg (senior) stepped down from leadership of Investor in 1997.

In 2006, the fifth generation took over the Wallenberg sphere. Marcus Wallenberg, son of Marc Wallenberg, Jacob Wallenberg and Peter Wallenberg (junior) both sons of Peter Wallenberg (senior).

==Modern business==
The Wallenbergs have a very low-key public profile, eschewing conspicuous displays of wealth. The family motto is &quot;Esse, non Videri&quot; (Latin for &quot;To be rather, than to seem). Wallenbergs business empire is often referred to as the Wallenberg sphere, the Wallenberg sphere is a large group of companies where their investment company, Investor AB, or foundation asset management company, Foundation Asset Management (FAM), have the controlling interest.

<text>was a &quot;tozama daimyō&quot; of Satsuma, the first to hold it as a formal fief (&quot;han&quot;) under the Tokugawa shogunate, and the first Japanese to rule over the Ryūkyū Kingdom. As lord of Satsuma, he was among the most powerful lords in Japan at the time, and formally submitted to Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1602, to prove his loyalty, being rewarded as a result with the name Matsudaira Iehisa; Matsudaira being a branch family of the Tokugawa, and &quot;Ie&quot; of &quot;Iehisa&quot; being taken from &quot;Ieyasu&quot;, this was a great honor. As of 1603, his holdings amounted to 605,000 &quot;koku&quot;.

==Biography==
Tadatsune was the third son of Shimazu Yoshihiro. Since Yoshihiro&#x27;s elder brother, Shimazu Yoshihisa, did not have a son and his other elder brother, &quot;Shimazu Hisakazu&quot;, had died of illness in Korea, he was deemed successor to their uncle and he later took the name of &quot;Iehisa&quot; (家久). Like his father and uncle, he was known for bravery on the battlefield. 

As head of the Shimazu clan, he sought to remove corrupt or disloyal counselors, and to reform the clan leadership. To this end, in 1599, he killed a long-time retainer and &quot;karō&quot;, Ijuin Tadamune, as well as his son, Ijuin Tadazane, when they tried to part with the Shimazu clan.

In 1602, he became the head of Shimazu clan but his father held real power until 1619. 

On April 5, 1609, Tadatsune led an expeditionary force to the Ryūkyū Kingdom, subjugating it and using it to affect trade with China. The Ryūkyūs were allowed to remain semi-independent, and would not be formally annexed by Japan until after the Meiji Restoration (1868); if China knew that the Ryūkyūs were controlled by the Japanese, trade would have come to an end. Thus, Tadatsune forced this unusual status upon the kingdom.

<doc id="1193709" wikidata="Q681554" url="?curid=1193709" title="Toron">
<text>Toron, now Tibnin or Tebnine in southern Lebanon, was a major Crusader castle, built in the Lebanon mountains on the road from Tyre to Damascus. The castle was the centre of the Lordship of Toron, a seigneury within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, actually a rear-vassalage of the Principality of Galilee.

== Lordship of Toron ==
The castle was built by Hugh of Fauquembergues, prince of Galilee, in 1106 AD to assist in capturing Tyre. After Hugh&#x27;s death, the surroundings of Tibnin were raided by &#x27;Izz al-Mulk, who killed the populace and made off with booty. Tibnin was made an independent seigneury, given to Humphrey I before 1109.

After Humphrey I of Toron, the castle and lordship of Toron successively passed to his descendants Humphrey II and Humphrey IV. Banias, which had been given to Baldwin II by the Assassins in 1128, was inherited by Toron in approximately 1148 when Humphrey II married the daughter of Renier Brus, lord of Banias and Assebebe. Humphrey II sold parts of Banias and Chastel Neuf to the Knights Hospitaller in 1157. Banias was merged with Toron until it fell to Nur ad-Din Zangi on 18 November 1164, and when it was recovered it became part of the Seigneury of Joscelin III of Edessa (see below).

Humphrey IV was also the prince of Oultrejourdain. Toron remained in Crusader possession until 1187, when it fell to the forces of Saladin after the Battle of Hattin in which Saladin all but destroyed the Crusader states. Ten years later, in November, 1197, Toron was besieged by the German contingent of the Crusade of 1197 and would have fallen. However, the Muslim garrison by the tribesmen of El-Seid and Fawaz held out until relief arrived from Egypt.

In 1219 Sultan al-Mu&#x27;azzam secretly had the defences of Toron, and of other castles, dismantled. This was done because the forces of the Fifth Crusade had captured the more crucial defences at Damietta on the Nile Delta and were now threatening Cairo. Sultan al-Mu&#x27;azzam was prepared to exchange the strongholds in Palestine for the ones in Egypt, but wished not to give strong defendable cities to the Crusaders if he could avoid it. Although the exchange proved unnecessary, the geographical position of the sites remained important for the Crusaders who were interested in recovering Jerusalem from Muslim control.

Indeed, despite their destruction, Toron, Safed and Hunin were recovered through a treaty in 1229, just two years after al-Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s death on November 11, 1227, by Frederick II from Sultan al-Kamil. As Toron was sold in 1220 to the Teutonic Knights together with the territories called the &quot;Seigneury de Joscelin&quot;, it came to a dispute between them and Alice of Armenia, the niece of Humphrey IV and heiress of the lordship of Toron. Alice successfully claimed her rights before the High Court and Frederick II assigned the lordship to her. But it seems the Franks were not able to take possession of the territories, In 1239, when the treaty ended, Toron fell back to the Ayyubids. Two years later, in 1241, it was restored to the Crusaders due to a treaty between Richard of Cornwall and Sultan as-Salih of Egypt.

In 1244, the castles held out against the Khwarezmian army and accomplished their objective of disrupting the Muslim attack on Jerusalem. Nonetheless, Jerusalem eventually fell to the overwhelming number of the Khwarezmian and the primary mission of the castles became obsolete. However, Toron tenuously remained in Crusader hands and was periodically under siege by the Mamluks until the jihad of Baibars further isolated it. Following a brief siege, Baibars in a rare display of mercy allowed the small Crusader contingent to evacuate in exchange for surrender, which they accepted.

The lords of Toron tended to be very influential in the kingdom; Humphrey II was constable of Jerusalem. Humphrey IV was married to Isabella, King Amalric I&#x27;s daughter (Toron passed into the &quot;royal domain&quot; during their marriage but its title was returned to Humphrey IV after their divorce). It was also one of the few to have a straight hereditary succession in the male line, at least for a few generations. The lords of Toron were also connected to the Lordship of Oultrejourdain by the marriage of Humphrey III and the maternal inheritance of Humphrey IV. Toron was later merged with the royal domain of Tyre, which went to a branch of Antioch, then their heirs from Montfort.

Toron had two vassals of its own, the Lordship of Chastel Neuf and the Lordship of Maron. Chastel Neuf was built by Hugh of Falkenberg around 1105 but was later given to the Hospitallers, until it fell to Nur ad-Din in 1167. Maron was given in 1229 to the Teutonic Knights in exchange for their claims on Toron.

==The castle==
The castle of Toron occupies a steep hill, in fact a Bronze Age tell, north to the village of Tibnin, at a height of above sea level. It is oval in shape with its outline following the contours of the tell. It once had twelve rectangular towers with one of them - to the south - having been the donjon. The castle, razed in 1266 by the Mamluks was rebuilt 500 years later in the mid-18th century by the Shiite sheikh Nasif al-Nassar during his struggle against the Ottoman rule. He used the ruins of the medieval walls as a basis for his rebuilding campaign and thus the castle today mainly appears as an Ottoman construction. The castle was then used as the home and base of the House of El-Assaad, the family of Nasif.

In 1881 it was noted that it was the residence of the local Governor, and that about twenty Muslims lived there.

The castle was damaged during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in late 2024, and one of the medieval walls collapsed.

<text>Lasalle College of the Arts, simply known as Lasalle, is a publicly-funded post-secondary arts institution in Singapore, and a constituent college of the University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) from 2024. 

Founded in 1984, Lasalle has eight art and design schools that offer more than 30 diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in contemporary arts and design education. Lasalle&#x27;s bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees are validated by Goldsmiths College, University of London.

Many leaders in the Singapore arts scene are linked to Lasalle, including Alan Oei as artistic director of The Substation and Eugene Tan as director of the National Gallery Singapore.

== History ==
=== 1984–1994 ===
Brother Joseph McNally, the founder of Lasalle College of the Arts, was known for his outstanding educational and artistic contributions in Singapore, which he made his home in 1946. He spent almost 40 years in Singapore teaching in various affiliated schools of the De La Salle Order including St Joseph&#x27;s Institution and St Patrick&#x27;s Secondary School. Upon retirement, McNally decided to follow through with his vision to elevate the arts culture in Singapore, holding the belief that the arts is instrumental to a nation.

In 1984, McNally founded Lasalle College of the Arts. Originally known as the St Patrick&#x27;s Arts Centre, the institution was funded largely through McNally&#x27;s own pocket, given the low priority, the Singapore government placed on the arts at that time. As an integrated arts college, the first cohort had a strength of 27 students who were offered diplomas in Painting, Ceramics, Sculpture, and Music.

In 1993, McNally&#x27;s effort in securing resources finally paid off when Singapore Airlines contributed S$15 million to enhance campus facilities. The college was subsequently renamed Lasalle-SIA College of the Arts. Other financial contributors to the college include the Khoo, Lee, Shaw and Hong Leong Foundations, and Airbus Industries. In the same year, an agreement was formalised with Australia&#x27;s RMIT University for its bachelor&#x27;s degree in Fine Arts to be awarded to graduates of Lasalle&#x27;s Fine Arts programme.

=== 1995–2009 ===
Following the government&#x27;s plans to rejuvenate Singapore&#x27;s art space, Lasalle began receiving financial support from the Ministry of Education. At Lasalle&#x27;s 10th anniversary celebration in 1995, then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong remarked that Lasalle played an important role in developing artists and their audience in Singapore, and announced that the Singapore government would be extending financial assistance to the college by providing an estimated sum of $4 million in grants. The college also started offering degrees, designed and developed in Singapore, to support the local and regional creative industries.

=== 2010–present ===
In 2010, Lasalle launched the MA Asian Art Histories programme, the first of its kind worldwide. Its focus is on Asian modern and contemporary art, where students are able to investigate recently emerged artists and movements within the geographical domain, and undertake research. In 2012, Lasalle established a partnership with Goldsmiths, University of London, to introduce 14 publicly-funded undergraduate arts degree programmes. A year later, the college introduced the MA Arts Pedagogy and Practice Programme. Its most recent programmes include MA Creative Writing and MA Design.

In March 2021, Minister for Education Lawrence Wong announced that Singapore&#x27;s first arts university will be established in an alliance between the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and Lasalle College of the Arts. The formation of the University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) will see both colleges under the umbrella university be given degree-awarding powers independent of their current foreign partners, where the current long-distance degrees are issued through foreign universities. Singaporeans and permanent residents enrolled in the approved degree programmes at the university of the arts will pay subsidised fees, comparable to the autonomous universities in Singapore.

==Facilities==

Lasalle moved to its new city campus at 1 McNally Street in 2007, and was re-branded as Lasalle College of the Arts. The Winstedt Campus opened in 2013, giving the college an additional 5,000 square metres of studio and workshop space.

It has 10 computer labs, 6 classrooms, 3 lecture theatres, and 56 studios.

=== Winstedt Campus ===
As Lasalle&#x27;s second campus, the Winstedt Campus is located near the Newton area. The campus was designed for students involved in studio-based modules, such as the visual arts, to develop and complete their semester projects. It is equipped with 14 Fine Arts, Media Arts &amp; Design Studios, 4 Fine Arts and Design technical workshops, 7 computer labs, and 5 classrooms. This campus used to be Madrasah Al-Irysad Al-Islamiah Secondary school before being added to Lasalle&#x27;s campuses.

The award involves participating in the mentoring and commissioning exhibition programme. A number of Lasalle alumni were recipients of the award, including filmmaker Boo Junfeng.
== Controversies ==
In February 2016, two items that were part of the group show &quot;Fault-lines: Disparate and desperate intimacies&quot; were removed from artist Loo Zihan&#x27;s installation &quot;Queer objects: An archive for the future&quot;. This action was agreed between the staff of Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) Singapore, part of Lasalle College of the Arts, curator Wong Binghao and Loo, and was due to the nature of the objects which could be potentially considered offensive to some members of the public. The items were a penis sheath and a butt plug. The ICA Singapore, curator and artist emphasised that the decision was taken to make the exhibition accessible to all, including students of the Lasalle College of the Arts, half of whom are under 18 years old.

<text>Alan Kennedy (born 31 August 1954) is an English former professional footballer who played the majority of his career as a left back for Newcastle United and then Liverpool. He was a stalwart member of the latter team that won many honours from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. At different times Kennedy was active as a professional in England, Denmark, Belgium and Wales, making over 500 appearances in a career that lasted for 22 years. He also represented England at senior international level.

==Club career==
Born in Sunderland, Kennedy started his professional career at the age of 18 for Newcastle United. After establishing his place in the side he played there for five years. He was a member of the team that lost the 1974 FA Cup Final to Liverpool. In 1978 he was transferred to Liverpool for £330,000, at the time a British record amount for a full-back.

Kennedy scored in the 1981 League Cup Final against West Ham, which ended 1–1 and was won by Liverpool in the replay. He scored the equalising goal with 15 minutes left in the game in the 1983 League Cup Final against Manchester United, a match Liverpool went on to win in extra time. Kennedy was a member of two other League Cup–winning Liverpool teams: in 1982 (against Tottenham Hotspur) and 1984 (against Everton).

In the 1981 European Cup Final against Real Madrid, Kennedy scored the only goal of the match late in the second half.

The 1984 European Cup Final between Liverpool and Roma was tied at 1–1 after extra time, so the winner was determined by penalty kicks. Kennedy scored the decisive penalty (the fifth taken by the team, the fourth that was successful) that clinched the victory for Liverpool.

Kennedy was a regular player in the Liverpool teams that won five league championship titles, in 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83 and 1983–84.

==International career==
He also earned two caps for the England national team in 1984.

==Personal life==
His elder brother is fellow footballer Keith Kennedy. His nephew is Tom Kennedy, Keith&#x27;s son.

In 2019 and 2020, Kennedy featured as a guest substitute player in both seasons of ITV show &quot;Harry&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting to return a squad of former England international footballers to sufficient fitness for a game against Germany legends.

<text>Shen Yinmo (; 1883June 1, 1971) was a Chinese poet and calligrapher.

== Early years ==
He was born in Hanyin County, Shaanxi. He made his name in Kyoto, Japan. He was one of the first to write in the new style and he published his poems in periodicals such as &quot;La Jeunesse&quot; (&quot;New Youth&quot;) and &quot;Xīncháo&quot; (新潮, &quot;The Renaissance&quot;). Two works that made him famous were &quot;Sānxián&quot; () and &quot;Qiūmíng Jí&quot; (). &quot;Sānxián&quot; (1918) was one of the earliest poems written in the new vernacular style. He also wrote poems in the classical style. In his poems, he used rhyme and alliteration similar to the usage in classical poetry. He was a professor in several universities, and later became president of Beiping University.

&quot;Photo: 1929 New Year party at Zhou Zuoren studio Shen Yinmo 2nd left, friend Zhang Fengju 1st left.&quot;

He resigned his post in 1932 due to dissatisfaction with government policies and moved to Shanghai. From that time Shen earned his livelihood from writings and calligraphy, accepting only occasional titular positions in government. When full-fledged Japanese invasion began, he went to Chongqing in 1939, and Chengdu in 1940 and returned again to Chongqing.

His first essay on calligraphy &quot;Five Word Brush Technique&quot; (执笔五字法) was published in 1943. It clarified the respective 5 word and 4-word brush techniques. Following the defeat of Japan, he returned to Shanghai and continued as a professional calligrapher and poet.

Shen Yinmo married his long-time companion Chu Baoquan ( on October 10, 1947. They went to Hangzhou for their honeymoon. She was also an accomplished calligrapher.

=== Poetry Example - &quot;Sānxián&quot; (三弦) ===
This short poem evokes vivid imagery, sound and emotion. It has no meter and no rhyme, all in vernacular. Yet it is undoubtedly a poem. A perfect example of the new style. 

=== Example of Literary Entertainment ===
Old friends celebrating meeting again in Shanghai, 1937. Composed poems and brush painting with toasts to produce this impromptu handscroll. The scroll was jointedly composed, jointly signed in several places, and all written by Shen Yinmo. The fish painting was by Shen Wangsi. 郭沫若 沈尹默 沈迈士 张凤举 民国廿六年(1937)作 鱼酒唱和手卷.

They were friends about a dozen years ago in Beijing and Tokyo and collaborated closely on many literary journals. Guo Moruo 郭沫若 just came back from his 2nd trip in Japan. Guo, Shen with his constant companion Zhubaoquan, Zhang Fengju 张凤举 with his new bride and Shen Wangsi 沈迈士 enjoyed a fish and wine fest to produce this joint handscroll in the Jingjiang Hotel. Soon Guo departed to join Mao Tse-dong to fight the Japanese invasion on the outskirts of Shanghai.

It was likely done at a similar occasion and presented to one of the guests.

== Post 1949 ==
Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic, he assumed a number of official and semi-official positions. These included Deputy Head of the Central Culture Bureau 中央文史馆副馆长 (appointed by Chou En Lai), Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Council Member上海市人委委员, member of the People&#x27;s Congress (national) and member of the People&#x27;s Consultative Committee 全国人大代表和政协委员. There were also numerous semi-official positions in cultural and calligraphy organizations. He personally established the Shanghai Chinese Calligraphy and Seal Research Institute上海市中国书法篆刻研究会.

Around 1950, his poems appeared prominently in the literature supplement of the newspapers &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, &quot;Wen Hui Bao&quot;, and &quot;Jiefang Daily&quot;. He published many articles, poems and calligraphy during the following dozen-plus years until the Cultural Revolution in 1966. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary for the People&#x27;s Republic in 1959, he presented 115 poems.

He was elected by Shanghai to be a Representative of the National People&#x27;s Congress in September 1964.

He is best known as a calligrapher. Shen Yinmo&#x27;s calligraphy stylistic range and techniques span to the Song dynasty masters. Most artists can only emulate to the Qing and few can achieve the Ming period. This is an assessment by Professor Lu 陆维钊 of the Zhejiang Academy of Arts. He was director of a research institute and published many historical studies on calligraphy drawing upon his personal mental and technical experiences when emulating famous earlier styles.

During the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) Shen, already in his 80s, was tortured by the Red Guards. They were against all non-communist forms of art and culture and declared Shen a &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;. He destroyed all his personal writings and his collection of old calligraphy and manuscripts. It was not enough. He was forced to write confessions and self-criticisms, posting them outside his house. These were eagerly taken by people who sought his calligraphy.

He eventually succumbed to the after effects of the repeated abuse at the age of 87.

=== Major Achievements. 书法大师 ===
Shen Yinmo was a unique and important figure in the 20th-century Chinese literary scene. His achievements were in 4 intersecting domains. 1) He was an accomplished poet both in classical and vernacular Chinese. 2) He was a great calligrapher who mastered a full range of styles going all the way back to the Song dynasty artists. He was prolific and left a huge body of works. 3) Shen Yinmo studied and analyzed the techniques of calligraphy brushwork publishing numerous works about brushwork. 4) He expanded the popularity of calligraphy as an art form by his numerous exhibitions and other activities as well as by cultivating younger talent.

<text>Richard Sandrak (born April 15, 1992, also known as Little Hercules) is an American former bodybuilder, martial artist and actor, known for his muscular physique at an extremely young age, and for his appearance in the documentary &quot;The World&#x27;s Strongest Boy&quot;.

==Early life==
Richard Sandrak was born 15 April 1992, in a small village in Ukraine, to Pavel Sandrak, a martial arts world champion, and Lena Sandrak, an aerobics competitor. In 1994, aged two, he moved with his family to Pennsylvania, where his parents believed he would have a better life. He began his training soon after they arrived. His father, who had trained in taekwondo, introduced him to various stretches and light weight training.

As young as 5 years old Richard would work out with his father seven hours a day doing 600 push-ups and 300 squats. He also had a very strict diet that did not allow junk food or sweets. Instead his diet consisted heavily of protein shakes and vegetables allowing him to have a &quot;claimed&quot; % body fat percentage, which many doctors urged is extremely dangerous. Doctors have said body fat this low can cause serious muscle and nerve damage among other health issues including heart failure.

The family subsequently moved to California, with the intention to break into show business. The family met trainer Frank Giardina, while touring one of Giardina&#x27;s gyms, and hired him to help gain publicity for their son.

During an interview Richard&#x27;s trainer admitted that there were no toys in the boys home, he had never visited a playground before and was rarely allowed outside. The fact he was homeschooled meant his parents were able to implement such strict exercise routines.

==Career==
Sandrak&#x27;s parents, Pavel and Lena, started him out with light exercises and martial arts techniques which soon progressed into more intense bodybuilding training. At the age of six, he could lift on standard bench-press, claiming his title as world&#x27;s strongest boy and the nickname &quot;little Hercules&quot;. By eight,sources claimed he was bench-pressing .

During his childhood, Sandrak worked out with his father, doing up to 600 push-ups and sit-ups a day, as well as 300 squats. Dedicating all of his time towards training, he never had time to play with friends and experience a typical childhood. Being on a strict diet enforced by his father, Sandrak was never able to eat junk food or any sweets. Sandrak recalls days when his father would eat pizza in front of him, while he was left to eat a head of lettuce. According to Giardina, Sandrak was made to repeat intense exercises as punishment if he got something wrong. Sandrak states his father never forced him into bodybuilding. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been forced to train or do anything against my will&quot;, he said. &quot;My parents used to train all the time and I wanted to join in. It was mostly my choice. It&#x27;s just what I grew up doing. I was never forced. It was never an issue.&quot;

Sandrak began travelling across the country to participate in competitions, promotions for nutrition products, and photo shoots for numerous magazines. He also appeared on several TV and radio shows, such as &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. As he got older his career gradually waned. His Hollywood debut was as the titular character in the 2009 film Little Hercules in 3D.

Giardina quit his functions as trainer and promotor after he came to feel that Pavel&#x27;s parenting was criminal, and Pavel threatened to kill Giardina. Not long afterwards Pavel was imprisoned for physically assaulting his wife, leaving her with a broken wrist and nose, an event during which Richard called the police. By September 2007, Pavel had been recently released from prison, though held under psychiatric guidance, and faced the possibility of deportation. Lena and Richard later left Pavel.

A year later, Sandrak was profiled in the documentary &quot;The World&#x27;s Strongest Boy&quot;, which detailed his ability to do splits and bench-press three times his own body weight, and claims that less than one percent of his body weight was fat, which can be lethally low. Though medical experts argued that such muscular development requires testosterone that is not found in children younger than ten, and speculated that steroids were involved, Lena Sandrak denied that her son used such substances.

By age 15, Sandrak continued to train five times a week, 90 minutes per session, and ate food more typical of other teens, like pizza. His live-in manager, Marco Garcia, helped to normalize his life and produced &quot;Little Hercules in 3-D&quot;. Sandrak continued to make more movies, and devoted his time to raising awareness of childhood obesity.

In an &quot;Inside Edition&quot; interview in 2015, Sandrak said he quit bodybuilding when he became bored with it after his father went to prison, and now does cardio exercises like chin-ups, stair climbing and skateboarding. He said he would like to become a “quantum scientist” and an engineer for NASA.

Dubbed &quot;Mayor-for-Life,&quot; he was re-elected to seven four-year terms, serving from 1982 to 2010. After leaving office, Reed faced charges on nearly 500 counts of theft, fraud and corruption. He pled guilty to 20 charges and was sentenced to probation. Reed died on January 25, 2020, in Harrisburg at the age of 70 from prostate cancer.

== Biography ==
Reed was born in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. After moving to Harrisburg in the 1950s, Reed attended Bishop McDevitt High School, where he graduated in 1967. He went on to attend Dickinson College and was named a Finnegan Fellow in 1970. He did not graduate from Dickinson and later served as an emergency medical technician in Harrisburg, while pursuing his early political career. Reed was openly gay.

=== Political life ===
Active in the Democratic Party as a teenager, Reed headed the Teenage Democrats of Pennsylvania, was Vice-President of the College Young Democrats of Pennsylvania, and was active in many civic activities. Among his early work experiences was a staff job for the Democratic Caucus in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

In the Democratic landslide victory year of 1974, when he was 25, Reed campaigned hard for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and upset four-term Republican incumbent George Gekas, who later became a Pennsylvania state senator and U.S. Congressman. He would go on to serve three terms as a member of the state&#x27;s House of Representatives until 1980.

=== As Mayor ===
Re-elected to the state house in 1976 and 1978, Reed was elected Dauphin County, Pennsylvania Commissioner in 1979 and Mayor of Harrisburg in 1981. He won re-election as mayor in 1985, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2005. During the 2000s, he was considered &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s most popular and successful mayor.&quot;

During Reed&#x27;s tenure, restaurants, museums, hotels, several large office buildings and new residences were constructed within the city limits. Reed was instrumental in the city getting its minor league baseball team, the Harrisburg Senators, and later led the city to purchase the team when it was sold to a buyer who intended to move it out of the region.

Harrisburg is also known worldwide for its use of land value taxation. Harrisburg has taxed land at a rate six times that on improvements since 1975, and this policy has been credited by Reed, as well as by the city&#x27;s former city manager during the 1980s, with helping reducing the number of vacant structures in downtown Harrisburg from about 4,200 in 1982 to less than 500.

Reed is credited with conceiving and developing Harrisburg&#x27;s City Island park, the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology, and the high school that accompanied it. He is the and driving force behind the construction of the $32 million National Civil War Museum in the city.

In 2000, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania placed Reed in charge of the failing Harrisburg School District, for which he imposed a massive reform and rehabilitation project. Most recently, in 2006 Reed was credited and recognized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for reducing the city&#x27;s flood risks.

Reed&#x27;s successes are balanced by setback: population loss, mounting debt, and continued poverty remain challenges as Harrisburg&#x27;s slow recovery continues. Those setbacks notwithstanding, in December 2006 the City Mayors organization recognized Reed&#x27;s achievements by awarding him the bronze third place in its annual World Mayor competition.

Reed continued to bear strong criticism for purchases of historical Civil War and &quot;American Old West&quot; artifacts with public funds. The artifact purchases were intended for use in a planned Old West Museum, part of a larger plan by Reed to develop a &quot;critical mass&quot; of national and historically focused museums in Harrisburg, centered on the National Civil War Museum. Plans for the Old West Museum met strong public opposition and Reed placed the plans on hold, commissioning a public study (funded by an auction of some of the artifacts) to review the feasibility of the museum.

Reed faced similar criticism when acquiring artifacts for the National Civil War Museum. Opponents and critics are most critical about the methods Reed used to fund the purchases without public oversight: &quot;Every time the independent Harrisburg Authority floats bonds for the Harrisburg school district and other government agencies, it collects a fee and deposits it into an account. The mayor can draw on that account for any capital expense as long as he has the signatures of two members of the authority (all appointed by the mayor).&quot;

Reed won reelection in 2005, unopposed, after winning the Democratic Primary against Jason N. Smith, a Harrisburg entrepreneur and outspoken critic of the Old West Museum and artifact purchases.

As late as January 2009, he was called &quot;Mayor-for-life.&quot; In the May 2009 Democratic Primary, Reed lost his re-election bid to Harrisburg City Council president Linda D. Thompson.

=== Corruption Indictment and conviction ===
On July 14, 2015, Kathleen Kane, the Attorney General of the State of Pennsylvania, announced 499 criminal charges against Reed for his activities involving the museums and the incinerator project. &quot;This is one of the most disturbing cases of public corruption this office has investigated&quot;, Kane said. &quot;Mayor Reed used taxpayer money to further his own interests. His conduct is at the root of the fiscal issues that continue to plague the city of Harrisburg today.&quot;

Reed was charged with diverting money from Harrisburg bond funds, including buying Wild West and Civil War memorabilia, some of which he hoarded in a private collection at his home, or sold for his own benefit. Noting his long tenure in office, Kane said as mayoral terms passed Reed came to disregard legal restraints on expenditures.

In response Reed said: &quot;I devoted my life to the city of Harrisburg, and I look forward to waging a vigorous fight against these charges. There is much more to this story. It&#x27;ll come out eventually. Just not today.&quot; Reed later said he had accidentally packed the items among his own when he left office.

The court dismissed 305 of the criminal charges for being beyond the statute of limitations. Reed pleaded guilty to 20 of the remaining felony and misdemeanor counts of receiving stolen property. He was given no jail time, instead sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and a fine.

<doc id="1193726" wikidata="Q2432392" url="?curid=1193726" title="Florida State Road 23">
<text>State Road 23 (SR 23), also known as the First Coast Expressway, is a controlled-access toll road serving as an outer bypass around the southwest quadrant of Jacksonville, Florida. , the first phase has been built, linking Interstate 10 (I-10) near Whitehouse with SR 21 (Blanding Boulevard) in the Middleburg area. The second phase to Green Cove Springs is currently under construction, and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025.

The ultimate plan is for a four-lane controlled-access, electronically-tolled highway between I-10 and I-95. The total investment for the entire highway is estimated at $2 billion. Construction of the final section began 2024 and is expected to be completed by 2032. It extends from near Green Cove Springs, crosses the St. Johns River, then continues east through fast-growing northern St. Johns County to a point approximately north of the World Golf Village interchange along I-95.

==Route description==
The First Coast Expressway begins at an interchange with US Highway 90 (US 90, Beaver Street). Shortly after, the expressway heads southbound towards a cloverstack interchange with I-10. Following the major interchange, the freeway widens to two lanes and continues south towards interchanges with POW-MIA Memorial Highway and SR 134 (103rd Street), providing access to the nearby Cecil Field. The highway continues through the suburban outskirts of Jacksonville before crossing into Clay County following the interchange with Argyle Forest Boulevard/Oakleaf Plantation Parkway. The expressway follows a pair of frontage roads from the second interchange with Oakleaf Plantation until the half-diamond interchange with Old Jennings Road. The highway continues for roughly , passing by St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, until it reaches its current southern terminus at SR 21 (Blanding Boulevard) near Middleburg.

==History==

The plans for connecting I-10 to SR 21 (Blanding Blvd) date back to 1979. SR 23 was originally planned as a toll road by Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise to meet those plans, but those plans fell through in 1997.

The Jacksonville Transportation Authority and Clay County worked together to connect Branan Field Road in Clay County and Chaffee Road in Duval County. By 2003, the Duval County section was open, and connected south to Branan Field Road in Clay County. By late 2004, the Clay County section was added. Currently the entire route stretches from I-10 in Jacksonville to SR 21 (Blanding Blvd) in Middleburg.

The project was formerly known as the First Coast Outer Beltway and the Branan Field-Chaffee Expressway, but its current name is the First Coast Expressway.

==Future==

The partial outer beltway when finished will contain 17 interchanges and a new bridge across the St. Johns River in place of the current two-lane Shands Bridge.

===Funding===
Funding for the $1.8 billion project will be competitively bid as a public-private partnership (PPP) opportunity for private sector businesses. By using a PPP and innovative contracting solutions, the project will be built years earlier than with traditional contracting methods. The awarded contractor(s) will serve as the concessionaire to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the beltway. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is currently engaging private contractors in a competitive bidding process. The I-595 Corridor Express PPP with I-595 Express LLC was the first of its kind in Florida, opening years ahead of schedule. The beltway is the one of largest public infrastructure projects to be undertaken in Northeast Florida.

In early 2011, FDOT abandoned the plan to find a private company to build the entire beltway and just focus on building the 15 mile section between I-10 and SR 21 (Blanding Boulevard). This section is partly built and would need flyovers built and widening done for the expressway to be complete. It is expected to cost around $291 million and would be a tollway.

In August 2011, FDOT announced that the Florida&#x27;s Turnpike Enterprise will be taking on the $291 million project of turning the stretch into a tollway. Construction started on September 10, 2012, and was completed in 2017.

Construction on the second phase of the expressway, from SR 21 (Blanding Boulevard) to Green Cove Springs started in October 2019 and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025. The third and final phase of the project, which includes replacement of the Shands Bridge, started in May 2023 and will be completed in 2031. Bridge construction will begin in 2024. Construction on the segment between County Road 16A (CR 16A) to St. Johns Parkway (CR 2209) is expected to start in early 2025, and from St. Johns Parkway to I-95 in late 2025.

===Tolling===
All tolls are electronic and compatible with SunPass used in other parts of the state with no toll booths. There is a free section between US 90 and New World Avenue which helps promote growth in the Cecil Commerce Center, and the future Shands Bridge crossing the St. Johns River will be free as well.

==Exit list==
Tolls are collected between each exit south of exit 42.

<text>Charles Richard Sharpe (2 April 1889 – 18 February 1963) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Charles Sharpe was a farmer&#x27;s boy from Pickworth, near Bourne, Lincolnshire, who ran away from home to join the army at the age of sixteen. He had served with the 2nd battalion in the Bermuda Garrison before the war, arriving on the Western Front with that battalion 6 November 1914.

He was an acting corporal in the 2nd Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, British Army and 26 years old when the following deed took place during the Battle of Aubers Ridge in First World War for which he was awarded the VC.

He later achieved the rank of company sergeant major. He left the army in 1928.

On return to civilian life, he worked at a number of jobs, notably as a physical training instructor to boys at the Hereward Camp approved school at Bourne. In World War II a number of bombs were dropped on the approved school, a row of wooden huts adjacent to Bourne Woods that may have been mistaken for a military camp; Sharpe was injured.

While staying in Workington with his daughter, Mrs Dorothy Foster, Sharpe died on 18 February 1963 of cerebral thrombosis after suffering a fall four days earlier and fracturing several of his ribs.

==The Medal==
His medal is held by South Kesteven District Council, Grantham.

<text>This article outlines the timeline of events before, during, and after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States.

==Prelude==
October 24, 1956: Lee Harvey Oswald drops out of high school and joins the U.S. Marine Corps, where he is trained as a sharpshooter.

October 31, 1959: Oswald defects to the Soviet Union and is sent to work at an electronics factory in Minsk.

November 8, 1960: John F. Kennedy wins the 1960 United States presidential election.

June 13, 1962: Oswald returns to the United States with the wife Marina and their child to live in Texas.

October 9, 1962: Oswald rents P.O. Box 2915 under his real name at the Dallas post office. He will maintain the rental until May 14, 1963.

November 6, 1962: Democrat John Connally is elected governor of Texas.

===1963: leading up to the day of the assassination===
January 15: Connally takes the oath as governor of Texas. As governor, he will assist with planning for President Kennedy&#x27;s trip to Texas and will serve as Kennedy&#x27;s host.

February 22: Ruth Paine meets the Oswalds at a party held at Everett Glover&#x27;s house.

March 13: Klein&#x27;s Sporting Goods of Chicago receives a mail order in the amount of $21.45 ($19.95 plus $1.50 for postage and handing) for item C20-750, a World War II-surplus Italian 1891 Carcano Model 1938 rifle equipped with a 4× scope that was advertised in the February 1963 issue of &quot;American Rifleman&quot;. The name on the order slip is A. Hidell, an alias used by Oswald, and the delivery address is Oswald&#x27;s Dallas post-office box. The rifle sent to Oswald bears serial number C2766.

March 17: Marina Oswald sends a letter to the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., asking to be granted an entrance visa to the USSR.

Oswald is given notice in the latter part of March that he will be terminated from his job.

April 6: Oswald works his last day at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall.

April 10: Oswald fires a bullet that narrowly misses retired general Edwin Walker, a strongly anticommunist right-wing advocate. The police determine that the shot was fired from a distance of less than 40 yards. The case remained unsolved until two weeks after Oswald&#x27;s death when Marina Oswald informed the FBI that it may have been her husband who had fired the shot.

April 23: Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Texas native, tells reporters in Dallas that President Kennedy may visit Texas sometime that summer. Johnson hopes that Kennedy&#x27;s schedule would allow him to have a breakfast in Fort Worth, a luncheon in Dallas, an afternoon tea in San Antonio and dinner in Houston.

April 24: In the late evening, Oswald leaves Dallas by bus for his hometown of New Orleans, seeking better employment opportunities.

June 5: President Kennedy, Johnson and Connally are together in a meeting in El Paso when they agree to a second presidential visit to Texas later that year.

June 6: Kennedy decides to embark on the Texas trip with three basic goals in mind: to raise more Democratic Party presidential campaign fund contributions, to begin his quest for reelection in November 1964 and, because the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had barely won Texas in 1960 (and had even lost in Dallas), to mend political fences among several leading Texas Democratic Party members who appear to be fighting politically against themselves.

June 24: Oswald applies for a U.S. passport in New Orleans, Louisiana, stating that he intends to depart from New Orleans during the period from October to December 1963 for proposed travel as a tourist for a duration of between three months and one year. The next day, he is issued U.S. Passport DO 92526, which will be valid for three years to all countries except Albania, Cuba and those portions of China, Korea and Vietnam that are under communist control.

September 17: Jack Valenti sends an invitation to the White House asking whether President Kennedy would attend a dinner in Houston on November 21 honoring congressman Albert Thomas for his decision not to retire from Congress. The invitation is received at the White House on September 19, 1963.

Oswald is issued a 15-day Mexican tourist card using the name &quot;LEE, Harvey Oswald.&quot;

September 23: Ruth Paine drives Marina Oswald from New Orleans back to her home in Irving, Texas. Late that night, Lee Oswald also leaves New Orleans to travel to Mexico City hoping to somehow gain entrance to Cuba, a country to which travel has been banned by the United States.

September 24: At a press conference in Austin, Governor Connally announces that he will visit Washington, D.C., from October 2–4, 1963 and that he hopes to see President Kennedy. Connally says that has no plans to invite Kennedy to visit Texas but would be delighted if the president would agree to a visit.

The White House accepts the invitation to the Albert Thomas dinner in Houston and turns it into a two-day political trip encompassing the major cities of Texas. Although Kennedy had wanted to visit Texas at some point, he had not originally planned to go there in November.

September 25: White House sources, in an exclusive to the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, announce that the president will visit Texas November 21–22, 1963 and that the tour will include Dallas.

September 26: The &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; is the first newspaper to announce the Texas visit in an article covering the president&#x27;s conservation tour in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

September 27: Lee Oswald arrives in Mexico City and registers at the Hotel del Comercio. He visits the Cuban consulate three times in an attempt to secure a visa to Cuba, as well as the Soviet embassy to obtain a visa, but is denied at both places.

September 30: Lee Oswald purchases a bus ticket using the alias &quot;Mr. H. O. Lee.&quot; The bus leaves Mexico City for Laredo, Texas at 8:30 a.m. on October 2.

October 3: Oswald arrives in Dallas and spends the night at the YMCA.

October 4: Governor Connally meets with President Kennedy at the White House.

Oswald applies for a job at Padgett Printing but is not hired because of a poor recommendation provided by Robert Stovall, president of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall.

Oswald returns to stay at the Paines&#x27; residence in Irving for the weekend.

October 11: Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell sends a reply to Jack Valenti formally accepting his invitation for the president to speak at the dinner honoring Rep. Thomas.

October 15: Ruth Paine calls the Texas School Book Depository and arranges for a job interview for Oswald with building superintendent Roy Truly. Truly interviews Oswald later that day and hires him for $1.25 per hour as a temporary clerk filling customer book orders. Oswald starts work the following day. At about the same time, Paine had separated from her husband Michael.

October 20: Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell, special assistant and appointments secretary to President Kennedy, calls Jerry Bruno, the advance man for the Kennedy trips, and asks him to come to the White House to discuss the trip to Texas.

October 21: Bruno meets with O&#x27;Donnell and is told to contact Walter Jenkins, one of Vice President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s top administrative assistants, to solicit his input for the trip.

October 24: Bruno meets with Jenkins, who tells Bruno about the stops that Governor Connally has suggested. The first stop would be to fly to San Antonio on November 21 and drive in a motorcade to Brooks Air Force Base, then fly to Houston and drive in a motorcade to the Rice Hotel, where the Albert Thomas dinner was originally scheduled to take place, and stay overnight at the hotel. Then on the morning of November 22, the president would fly to Fort Worth to receive an honorary degree at Texas Christian University at 9:30 a.m. and then ride in a motorcade for the short distance to Dallas, where he would attend a luncheon at the annual meeting of the Dallas Citizens Council at the Statler Hilton Hotel. Finally, the president would attend a fundraising dinner in Austin before returning to Washington. Jenkins suggests that Bruno visit Texas, meet with Governor Connally and evaluate the sites himself, and also meet with Democratic Texas senator Ralph Yarborough, a bitter political enemy of Connally and Johnson, to avoid any trouble between the two parties on the trip.

United States ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson II delivers a contentious speech on United Nations Day at the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, where he is booed and heckled. After the speech, he is struck on the head with a picket sign and spit upon. Dallas police would later fear that similar demonstrations might occur when Kennedy visited Dallas. Several people, including Stevenson, warned Kennedy against coming to Dallas, but Kennedy ignored their advice.

October 28: Bruno flies to Austin to begin his evaluation of the stops being considered for the Kennedy visit on November 21–22.

October 29: Bruno meets with Henry Brown, president of the Texas AFL–CIO and a friend of Senator Ralph Yarborough, to obtain his input from labor leaders. He then has lunch with Governor Connally to review his itinerary, which includes an honorary degree from Texas Christian University; because Kennedy is Catholic, Bruno considers this event among the highlights of the trip. Connally informs Bruno that he has assigned different members of his staff to each stop on the itinerary and that they would be in charge of the visit. Bruno tells Connally that he welcomes his input and suggestions, but that the final decisions on the itinerary will be made by the White House.

Governor Connally announces that a &quot;Texas welcome dinner&quot; for Kennedy will be held in Austin on November 22. The governor says that the dinner will be a $100-per-plate event held at 7:30 p.m. at the Austin Municipal Auditorium as a climax to the president&#x27;s Texas trip. It is sponsored by the state Democratic executive committee. No other plans have been completed except those for the November 21 Albert Thomas appreciation dinner in Houston.

October 30: Bruno and Johnson aide Clifton Carter visit the Texas cities that the president will visit. The San Antonio and Houston sites are checked and confirmed as acceptable, but when visiting Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Bruno is informed by school officials that the university does not intend to confer an honorary degree to the president and that they have only approved the use of their campus as the location for a speech. Bruno informs Connally of this development, and Connally says that he will meet with the university&#x27;s board of regents the next night. Bruno travels to Dallas to evaluate the ballroom at the Statler Hilton Hotel where the luncheon is planned to take place on November 22. He is met there by J. Erik Jonsson, chairman of the Dallas Citizens Council (and an owner of Texas Instruments) and Robert B. Cullum, chairman of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce and owner of the Tom Thumb Food Stores. Cullum informs Bruno that the ballroom at the Statler Hilton is now unavailable because organizers of a bottlers&#x27; convention had reserved it and would not surrender it. Jonsson and Cullum suggest the Dallas Trade Mart, but after visiting the site, Bruno dislikes the many catwalks that would be above the president, which, in light of the Stevenson incident that had just occurred a few days earlier, could present a security problem. He asks to be shown other available sites in Dallas.

October 31: Bruno visits two other potential luncheon sites, the Dallas Memorial Auditorium, which he deems too large, and the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest, which he believes would be too far out of town and thus impractical. He is also informed that Governor Connally is unhappy with the decision not to use the Trade Mart for the luncheon because of the catwalk issue. Bruno agrees to visit the Trade Mart again but retains his misgivings. Connally telephones that he has met with the TCU board of regents and that they will not confer an honorary degree on the president. Bruno is now faced with two holes in the schedule, Fort Worth and Dallas. One last place is suggested as a luncheon possibility, the Women&#x27;s Building (now known as the Women&#x27;s Museum) at the fairgrounds at Fair Park.

President Kennedy is asked at a press conference about rumors that Johnson will not be selected as his running mate in the 1964 election, which Kennedy denies.

November 1: Bruno returns to Washington, D.C., with the Dallas luncheon site location still undecided. The Fort Worth visit is eventually resolved when the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce agrees to sponsor a breakfast for the president. Because of this, the president&#x27;s overnight stay is changed from Houston to Fort Worth so that he will have time to attend the breakfast.

November 4: Gerald Behn, the Secret Service Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) for the White House detail, telephones Forrest Sorrels, Secret Service SAIC of the Dallas district. He instructs Sorrels to survey the buildings that the president is planning to visit during the Dallas leg of the trip. The two leading contenders to host the Dallas luncheon are the Trade Mart (strongly favored by Governor Connally) and the Women&#x27;s Building at the state fairgrounds, which Bruno favors and Connally bitterly opposes. Later that day, Sorrels reports back to Behn that the Women&#x27;s Building appears to be preferable from a security standpoint, but that it is not a suitable place to take the president. He reports that the Trade Mart has about 60 entrances as well as six catwalks over the area where the luncheon would be held, which could pose a problem in adequately staffing the site with security personnel.

White House Secret Service agent Winston Lawson is informed that he has been assigned to the Dallas visit.

November 5: Bruno visits the White House and has separate meetings with Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell, Gerald Behn and Walter Jenkins. It is decided that the Trade Mart poses too great a security risk, and the Women&#x27;s Building is chosen as the Dallas luncheon site.

November 6: White House press secretary Pierre Salinger announces that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy will accompany the president on his Texas trip.

November 7: The Albert Thomas appreciation dinner to be held on November 21 sells out a second time. Organizers of the dinner had already moved the venue from the Rice Hotel, where the event had sold out, to the larger Sam Houston Coliseum because of increased demand for tickets once it became known that Kennedy would attend. After it was announced that the First Lady would also attend, tickets to the dinner at the larger venue sold out as well.

Bruno composes a proposed schedule for the Texas trip, which includes the Women&#x27;s Building as the site for the Dallas luncheon.

November 8: It is announced that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy will begin resuming her official White House duties on November 20, more than a month earlier than expected. She had previously announced the cancellation of all her events for the rest of the year following the premature birth and death of her third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, the past August.

November 9: Oswald is driven by Ruth Paine to take his driver&#x27;s license permit test, but because there is a special election that day, the office is closed.

Around 2 p.m., Oswald test-drives a new red Mercury Comet Caliente two-door hardtop at a dealership at 118 East Commerce in Dallas. He tells salesman Albert Bogard that he will be back to buy it in two or three weeks when he will have the $300 down payment.

November 12: A special flight carrying all the advance groups that are to work on the preparation for the trip to Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth and Dallas departs Andrews Air Force Base at 8:20 a.m.

November 13: Jack Puterbaugh and White House Secret Service agent Winston Lawson, along with Dallas Secret Service agents Forrest Sorrels and Robert Steuart, visit the office of Robert B. Cullum, president of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce, to discuss plans for the Kennedy visit. They reexamine the Trade Mart and the Women&#x27;s Building and meet with representatives of the Trade Mart.

November 14: Acquiescing to the wishes of Governor Connally, Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell reverses his prior decision to hold the Dallas luncheon at the Women&#x27;s Building and changes the location to the Dallas Trade Mart. According to both O&#x27;Donnell and Bruno, this change in the luncheon site, although seemingly insignificant at the time, dramatically alters the motorcade route taken through Dallas.

Oswald appears at the Allright Parking Garage at 1208 Commerce Street to inquire about job openings.

November 15: President Kennedy delivers a speech in New York City at the AFL–CIO convention and then flies to West Palm Beach, Florida to spend his last weekend.

The White House announces that the Dallas Trade Mart will be the site of President Kennedy&#x27;s luncheon address and that a motorcade will proceed through downtown Dallas. Until that point, there had been speculation in the news media that Kennedy&#x27;s tight schedule in Texas would not allow enough time for a motorcade through Dallas.

November 16: Dallas civic leaders issue statements urging against demonstrations or incidents that may occur during President Kennedy&#x27;s visit. Dallas County judge W. L. Sterrett says: &quot;I am hoping we won&#x27;t have any kind of demonstration here. I have confidence that there won&#x27;t be anything of that sort. That kind of thing can give a city and county a black eye.&quot;

November 18: Kennedy confides to his good friend senator George Smathers of Florida that Vice President Johnson wants First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy to ride in the car with him during the upcoming tour of Texas. The exact motorcade route is finalized.

Dallas police chief Jesse Curry increased the level of security during Kennedy&#x27;s visit; he put into effect the most stringent security precautions in the city&#x27;s history. Curry even deputized citizens to take action for any suspicious acts that could endanger the president.

November 19: The White House formally announces the timetable of events for the president&#x27;s visit, including a planned arrival time of 12:30 p.m. CST at the Trade Mart.

November 21: At 11:07 p.m., Air Force One lands at Carswell Air Force Base on the outskirts of Fort Worth, Texas. The president and his wife are met by Raymond Buck, president of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, and his wife. Air Force Two also lands at Carswell with the vice president Lyndon Johnson, Texas governor John Connally and Senator Ralph Yarborough. Connally and Yarborough dislike each other so much Yarborough is unwilling to travel in the same car with Johnson, who is an ally of Connally. The following day, the president instructs him to ride with Johnson.

At 11:35 p.m., the Kennedys arrive at the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth, after being cheered by well-wishers lined on the route toward the West Freeway. The president and Mrs. Kennedy shake hands with admirers gathered outside the hotel before retiring to their assigned suite (Room 850) for the night.

==Friday, November 22, 1963==
All in Central Standard Time (CST) unless otherwise stated.

7:23 a.m.: Oswald goes to work at the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, with Buell Wesley Frazier, a young worker there. Frazier asks about the long, paper-wrapped package in Oswald’s arms, to which Oswald says: “Oh, just some curtains.”

8:45 a.m.: The president speaks before breakfast in a square across Eighth Street. The attendees, members of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce, are largely conservative Republicans.

9:10 a.m.: Kennedy takes his place in the Hotel Texas&#x27; grand ballroom for a scheduled speech. Afterwards, presidential adviser Kenny O&#x27;Donnell informs Roy Kellerman, the Secret Service agent in charge of the trip, that the presidential limousine should not be equipped with its bubbletop if the weather is clear in Dallas. Later, assistant (now-ranking), press secretary Malcolm Kilduff shows the Kennedys a negative advertisement published in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; with the headline &quot;Welcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas.&quot; Kennedy tells his wife: &quot;We&#x27;re heading into nut country today.&quot;

10:40 a.m.: Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade departs Hotel Texas for Carswell Air Force Base.

11:20 a.m.: Air Force One departs Carswell Air Force Base for Dallas, Texas.

11:35 a.m.: Air Force Two arrives at Love Field in Dallas.

11:38 a.m.: Air Force One arrives at Love Field in Dallas.

11:44 a.m.: The Kennedys and Connallys disembark Air Force One and are greeted by the Johnsons. The motorcade cars had been lined up in order earlier that morning.
11:55 a.m.: The motorcade departs Love Field about 15 minutes after the party had arrived, after the president and his wife take time to shake hands with many of the enthusiastic supporters. The motorcade leaves Love Field for its 10-mile trip through downtown Dallas. The motorcade route took a left turn from the south end of Love Field to West Mockingbird Lane and continued through to central Dallas. It progressed down Main Street

12:29 p.m.: Motorcade turned right (westbound) into Houston Street, entering Dealey Plaza. The motorcade approached the Texas School Book Depository.

12:30 p.m.: Motorcade made a sharp 135-degree left turn onto Elm Street, a downward-sloping road. The giant Hertz Rent-a-Car clock on top of the Depository building was seen to change from 12:29 to 12:30 as the limousine turned onto Elm Street.

Witnesses recalled the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. Onlookers recalled hearing three shots. The Zapruder film shows the president reemerging after being temporarily hidden from view by the Stemmons Freeway sign at film frames 215–223, and his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression by frame 225. He has already been impacted by a bullet that struck him in the back and exited his throat, his hands clenched into fists. He then raises his fists in front of his face and throat as he turns to the left toward his wife. Connally is also hit. Secret Service Agent Clint Hill testified he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind Kennedy, at the equivalent of frame 308; about a quarter of a second before the president&#x27;s head exploded at frame 313. Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo. The three shots were fired in a timespan estimated to be from 4.8 to 7.9 seconds.

The Warren Commission report states that seconds after the shooting Roy Kellerman consulted his watch and said &quot;12:30&quot; to William Greer, before he radioed to Police Chief Jesse Curry that the President had been shot. Curry then communicated an order for Parkland Hospital to stand by – the Dallas police radio log reflects that this communication was made at 12:30.

As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream and she climbed onto the rear of the limo. At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. The Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, &quot;I have his brains in my hand!&quot; The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at an estimated to Parkland Hospital, along Stemmons Freeway and Harry Hines Boulevard, approximately four miles away.

12:33 p.m.: Oswald left the building through its front door. He had been confronted by patrolman Marion Baker and Depository superintendent Roy Truly in the second-floor lunchroom. Baker let Oswald pass after Truly identified Oswald as an employee. Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office. He left the building through its front door at approximately 12:33 p.m. Initially, Truly and Occhus Campbell, the Depository&#x27;s vice president, said that they had seen Oswald in the first-floor storage room. When asked during his interrogations about his whereabouts, Oswald claimed that he &quot;went outside to watch P. Parade&quot; (referring to the presidential motorcade), was &quot;out with [William Shelley, a foreman at the depository] in front&quot; and that he was at the &quot;front entrance to the first floor&quot; when he encountered a policeman.

12:34 p.m.: United Press International reporter Merriman Smith reported from a press car with a radiotelephone while travelling with the motorcade: &quot;Three shots were fired today at the president&#x27;s motorcade in downtown Dallas.&quot; Smith stayed on the phone as Jack Bell, an Associated Press reporter in the car, started punching Smith and yelling at him to hand over the phone. Smith would win the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the assassination.

12:36 p.m.: President Kennedy&#x27;s limousine arrives at Parkland Memorial Hospital. Parkland Hospital admitted Kennedy and Connally and immediately began treatment. Malcolm Perry, assistant professor of surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and a vascular surgeon, was the first to treat Kennedy. Perry performed a tracheotomy followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed with another surgeon. Other doctors and surgeons worked frantically to save the president&#x27;s life, but the wounds were too severe.

12:40 p.m.: Viewers of the live soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; receive the first national television report of the shooting from CBS News anchorman, Walter Cronkite.

12:45 p.m.: Dan Rather of CBS calls Parkland Memorial Hospital; a doctor there tells him he believes Kennedy is dead.

12:33 to 12:50 p.m.: Estimates of when the depository building was sealed off by police range from 12:33 to 12:50 p.m. The streets in and around Dealey Plaza were not immediately closed, and photos taken nine minutes after the assassination show vehicles still driving on Elm Street in front of Depository.

12:50 p.m.: Kennedy&#x27;s top military aide General Godfrey McHugh calls Air Force One from Parkland to state that they will soon be leaving for Andrews Air Force Base.

1:00 p.m.: President Kennedy is officially pronounced dead. Those who had treated Kennedy observed the president&#x27;s condition was &quot;moribund,&quot; meaning he had no chance of survival upon arrival at the hospital. &quot;I am absolutely sure he never knew what hit him,&quot; said Tom Shires, Parkland&#x27;s chief of surgery. Father Oscar Huber of Holy Trinity Catholic Church of Dallas administered the last rites to the president. Huber had needed to temporarily remove a sheet covering Kennedy&#x27;s face so the last rites could be performed. Connally was taken to emergency surgery, where he underwent two operations.

After receiving word of the president&#x27;s death, acting White House press secretary Malcolm Kilduff entered the hospital room where new president Johnson and his wife were sitting. Kilduff said, &quot;Mr. President, I have to announce the death of President Kennedy. Is it OK with you that the announcement be made now?&quot; Johnson ordered the announcement be made only after he left the hospital. When asking that the announcement be delayed, Johnson told Kilduff: &quot;I think I had better get out of here...before you announce it. We don&#x27;t know whether this is a worldwide conspiracy, whether they are after me as well as they were after President Kennedy, or whether they are after Speaker [John W.] McCormack or Senator [Carl] Hayden. We just don&#x27;t know.&quot; He later recounted to Merle Miller: &quot;I asked that the announcement be made after we had left the room...so that if it were an international conspiracy and they were out to destroy our form of government and the leaders in that government, that we would minimize the opportunity for doing so.&quot;

After leaving the depository, Oswald walked seven blocks before boarding a bus. When the bus became ensnarled in traffic, he exited the bus, walked to a nearby bus station, and hired a taxi. He asked the driver to stop several blocks past his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley Avenue, and he then walked back to the house. He arrived there at around 1:00 p.m.

1:04 p.m.: According to housekeeper Earlene Roberts, Oswald departed three or four minutes after arriving at the rooming house. She last saw him standing at a bus stop outside the house.

1:15 p.m.: Oswald shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit near the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, 0.86 miles from the rooming house. Thirteen people witnessed Oswald shooting Tippit or fleeing the immediate scene. By that evening, five witnesses had identified Oswald in police lineups.

1:16 p.m.: The first report that Police Officer Tippit has been shot.

1:26 p.m.: Lyndon Johnson departs Parkland Memorial Hospital for Love Field.

1:30 p.m.: Johnson, protected by Rufus Youngblood in a car driven by Jesse Curry, along with passengers Congressmen Albert Thomas and Homer Thornberry, arrives at Air Force One. Lady Bird Johnson, Congressman Jack Brooks, and three members of the Secret Service also arrive in a second car, and Jack Valenti, Lem Johns, Cliff Carter, and Cecil Stoughton arrive in a third. They are followed by additional cars containing officials and aides for both Kennedy and Johnson.

1:33 p.m.: White House Assistant Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff announces at Parkland Memorial Hospital that Kennedy is dead.
1:35 p.m.: After killing Tippit, Oswald was seen traveling on foot toward the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson Boulevard. At about 1:35 p.m. Johnny Calvin Brewer, the manager of Hardy&#x27;s Shoe Store, saw Oswald turning his face away from the street and ducking into the entranceway of Brewer&#x27;s store as Dallas police cars approached with sirens audible. When Oswald left the store, Brewer followed him and watched him enter the Texas Theatre without paying while ticket attendant Julie Postal was distracted.

1:38 p.m.: Anchorman Cronkite reports the official word that Kennedy is dead and Johnson will be sworn in as president.

1:40 p.m.: Johnson phones Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to express his condolences and ask where he should take the oath of office of the president of the United States.

Johnny Brewer notifies Julie Postal that Oswald is in the theatre. Postal in turn informs the Dallas police at 1:40 p.m.

1:45 p.m.: 15 police officers surround the movie theater where Oswald is hiding.

1:50 p.m.: Johnson telephones his friend Irving Goldberg, an attorney. The two decide to ask Sarah T. Hughes to administer the oath.

When an arrest attempt was made on Oswald inside the theater, Oswald resisted arrest and punched and attempted to shoot a patrolman after yelling, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s all over now!&quot;

1:51 p.m.: Police report Oswald in custody.

2:00 p.m.: Kennedy&#x27;s body was removed from Parkland Hospital and driven to Air Force One at Love Field. The removal occurred after an angry confrontation between Kennedy&#x27;s special assistant Ken O&#x27;Donnell backed by Kennedy&#x27;s Secret Service agents and doctors including medical examiner Earl Rose, along with a justice of the peace. The removal of Kennedy&#x27;s body may have been illegal according to Texas state law because it occurred before a forensic examination could be performed by the Dallas coroner.

Police’s paraffin tests confirm Oswald recently fired a gun.

2:10 p.m.: Abraham Zapruder arrives at WFAA-TV in Dallas and is interviewed about his film.

2:13 p.m.: Police find the weapon used to kill the president on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book depository.

2:30 p.m.: Interrogated for almost 12 hours, Oswald states he had nothing to do with the assassination. Shown photos of him holding a rifle Oswald &quot;sneered, saying that they were fake photographs … [taken] by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and revolver.&quot; He eventually stops answering all questions.

2:38 p.m.: Johnson is sworn in as president by federal judge Sarah Hughes on Air Force One.

2:47 p.m.: Air Force One departs Love Field for Washington, D.C.

7:05 p.m.: Oswald was charged with &quot;murder with malice&quot; in the killing of police officer J.D. Tippit.

11:26 p.m.: Oswald was then charged with the murder of President Kennedy.

==Days following the assassination==

Saturday, November 23, 1963

November 23: Military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where he lay in repose for 24 hours. The new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, issued , declaring Monday to be a national day of mourning, and only essential emergency workers to be at their posts. He read the proclamation over a nationwide radio and television broadcast at 4:45 p.m. from the Fish Room (currently known as the Roosevelt Room) at the White House.

Sunday, November 24, 1963

November 24: 11:21 a.m. before live television cameras, Oswald was shot and mortally wounded in the basement of Dallas Police headquarters by a local nightclub owner with alleged Mafia ties, Jack Ruby. Unconscious, Oswald was put into an ambulance and rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, the same hospital where doctors tried to save Kennedy two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07 pm.

Kennedy&#x27;s coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket, with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state.

Monday, November 25, 1963

November 25: Kennedy&#x27;s funeral service was held at St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral. The Requiem Mass was led by Cardinal Richard Cushing. About 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries, attended. After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

==Investigations and other developments==

March 14, 1964: Ruby was convicted of murder with malice and sentenced to death.

September 24, 1964: The Warren Commission&#x27;s 888-page final report was presented to President Johnson and made public three days later, saying one shot wounded President Kennedy and Governor Connally, and a subsequent shot hit Kennedy in the head, killing him. The Commission concluded a third shot was fired, but made no conclusion as to whether it was the first, second or third shot fired. The Commission concluded Oswald fired all three shots.

October 5, 1966: Appellate court ruled Ruby&#x27;s motion for a change of venue before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby&#x27;s conviction and death sentence are overturned. Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967.

January 3, 1967: Jack Ruby dies in prison from cancer.

March 1, 1967: New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others. 

January 29, 1969: Clay Shaw was brought to trial in Orleans Parish Criminal Court.

March 1, 1969: A jury took less than an hour to find Clay Shaw not guilty. It remains the only trial to be brought for the assassination of President Kennedy.

March 6, 1975: Assassination researchers Robert Groden and Dick Gregory present the first-ever US network television showing of the Zapruder film on the ABC late-night television show &quot;Good Night America&quot; (hosted by Geraldo Rivera).

March 29, 1979: The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated the assassination and based on incorrect acoustic evidence states Kennedy was &quot;probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy&quot;.

<text>Around the world, there were shocked reactions to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the President of the United States, on Friday, November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.

There was great confusion in the hour between Kennedy&#x27;s shooting and the announcement of his death. Taking place during the Cold War, it was at first unclear whether the shooting might be part of a larger attack upon the U.S., and whether Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had been riding two cars behind in the motorcade, was safe.

The news shocked the nation. Many people wept openly. Crowds gathered in public places to watch the television coverage. Traffic in some areas came to a halt as the news spread from car to car, even gathering around cars to listen to radio reports. Schools across the U.S. dismissed their students early. Misplaced anger against Texas and Texans was reported from some individuals. Various Cleveland Browns fans, for example, carried signs at the next Sunday&#x27;s home game against the Dallas Cowboys decrying the city of Dallas as having &quot;killed the president.&quot; There were also instances of Kennedy&#x27;s opponents cheering the assassination. A journalist reported rejoicing in the streets of Amarillo, with a woman crying out, &quot;Hey, great, JFK&#x27;s croaked!&quot;

The event left a lasting impression on many worldwide. As with the preceding attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941, and the subsequent September 11 attacks, asking &quot;Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination?&quot; would become a common topic of discussion.

==Reaction==
In the United States, Kennedy&#x27;s assassination dissolved differences among many people as they were brought together in one common theme: shock and sorrow after the assassination. It was seen in statements by the former presidents and members of Congress, etc. Barry Goldwater, the eventual Republican nominee in the 1964 presidential election, considered abandoning his planned campaign after the assassination because of his admiration for Kennedy. The news was so shocking and hit with such impact, according to the Nielsen Audimeter Service, within 40 minutes of the first reporting of the assassination, the television audience doubled, by early evening, 70% were at their television sets.

All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.

CBS Washington correspondent Roger Mudd summed it up: &quot;It was a death that touched everyone instantly and directly; rare was the person who did not cry that long weekend. In our home, as my wife (E.J.) watched the television, her tears caused our five-year-old son, Daniel, to go quietly and switch off what he thought was the cause of his mother&#x27;s weeping.&quot;

=== Financial ===
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been up 3.31 points (0.5%) for the day, at the moment shots were fired at Kennedy. Forty minutes later, as news of Kennedy&#x27;s death was breaking, it had already plunged 21.16 points (-2.8%), on very heavy trading volume. With the stock exchange already running 20 minutes behind floor transactions, the Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange announced that they had closed orders for the day. AMEX and commodities exchanges quickly followed. The new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, telephoned NYSE President G. Keith Funston and commended him for closing the exchange upon hearing the news of the assassination. Funston told LBJ in the phone conversation: &quot;Thanks, Mr. President. Nobody has complimented the stock exchange for anything in a long time.&quot;

The first trading day after the assassination, November 26, market averages rebounded sharply, recording the largest gains for any single day in history, and the fourth highest single day trading volume in NYSE history to that point.

===Foreign===
After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, many world leaders expressed shock and sorrow, some going on television and radio to address their nations. In countries around the world, state premiers and governors and mayors also issued messages expressing shock over the assassination. Many of them wondered if Johnson would carry on many of Kennedy&#x27;s policies. LBJ and the world would sympathize from the &quot;concern etched on Mr. Johnson&#x27;s face.&quot;

In many countries, radio and television networks, after breaking the news, either went off the air except for funeral music or broke schedules to carry uninterrupted news of the assassination, and if Kennedy had made a visit to that country, recalled that visit in detail. For example, in London, the BBC Television Service and the Independent Television Authority in London suspended their regular programs upon breaking the news. In several nations, monarchs ordered the royal family into days of mourning.

Fidel Castro announced Cuba mourned Kennedy. An FBI memorandum written by J. Edgar Hoover in 1966 and declassified in 2017 suggests that the government of the Soviet Union was shocked by the assassination and blamed it on a right-wing conspiracy to overthrow the government, invade Cuba, and start World War III. The KGB began investigating the new President Johnson, who it believed was responsible for the assassination. 

First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev and Chairman Leonid Brezhnev sent letters of condolence to Johnson stating, &quot;The villainous assassination of Head of the American State John F. Kennedy is a grievous, indeed a very grievous loss for your country. I want to say frankly that the gravity of this loss is felt by the whole world, including ourselves, the Soviet people&quot; and called the assassination &quot;a heavy blow to all people who hold dear the cause of peace and Soviet-American cooperation.&quot;

At U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, switchboards lit up and were flooded with phone calls. At many of them, shocked personnel let telephones go unanswered. They later opened up condolence books for people to sign. In Europe, the assassination tempered Cold War sentiment, as people on both sides expressed shock and sorrow. In Latin America, Brazilian president João Goulart decreed 3 days of mourning. 

News of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination reached Asia during the early morning hours of November 23, 1963, because of the time difference. In Japan, the news became the first television broadcast from the United States to Japan via the Relay 1 satellite, instead of a prerecorded message from Kennedy to the Japanese people. (Back in the U.S. where it was still November 22, the cancelled broadcast of Kennedy&#x27;s message was shown on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;).

=== Hostile ===
Hostile reactions to the late President Kennedy were registered from far-right elements.

In the South, where Kennedy was not popular because of his position on civil rights, some isolated incidents occurred, where some expressed joy to the death of Kennedy: schools in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and suburbs of Dallas itself.

President of the Memphis Citizens Council Richard Ely told the Nashville White Citizens Council that &quot;I firmly believe Mr. Kennedy died a tyrant&#x27;s death. He did not set back communism. He encouraged integration, which has the support of communism. He was a tyrant&quot;, causing half of the room, some of whom were Peabody College professors, to leave after they unsuccessfully demanded Ely to provide evidence for his claims. In Biloxi, Mississippi, student Thomas Hansen was thrown across a front glass door, after protesting against banners of celebration of the local section of the John Birch Society, before being hit with ultimately abandoned charges of vandalism.

As written by William Manchester in &quot;Death of a President&quot;:
An Oklahoma City physician beamed at a grief-stricken visitor and said, &quot;Good, I hope they got Jackie.&quot; In a small Connecticut city a doctor called ecstatically across Main Streetto an internist who worshiped Kennedy&quot;The joy ride&#x27;s over. This is one deal Papa Joe can&#x27;t fix.&quot; A woman visiting Amarillo, the second most radical city in Texas, was lunching in the restaurant adjacent to her motel when a score of rejoicing students burst in from a high school directly across the street. &quot;Hey, great, JFK&#x27;s croaked!&quot; one shouted with flagrant delight, and the woman, leaving as rapidly as she could, noticed that several diners were smiling back at the boy. In Dallas itself, a man whooped and tossed his expensive Stetson in the air, and it was in a wealthy Dallas suburb that the pupils of a fourth-grade class, told that the President of the United States had been murdered in their city, burst into spontaneous applause.

On December 1, after Malcolm X made a speech, reporters asked him for a comment about the assassination of President Kennedy. The spokesman for the Nation of Islam said that it was a case of &quot;&quot;, and added that &quot;chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they&#x27;ve always made me glad.&quot; 

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of Patrice Lumumba, Congo leader, of Medgar Evers, civil rights leader, and of the Negro girls bombed earlier this year in a Birmingham church. These, he said, were instances of other &#x27;chickens coming home to roost&#x27;.&quot; The newspaper noted that his comments were greeted by &quot;loud applause and laughter&quot; from the all-black audience. It quoted an unnamed audience member, who told a reporter he applauded Malcolm X&#x27;s remarks &quot;more for the fact that he had the nerve to say it than that I really approved of it&quot;.

==Unofficial mourning==
Hastily organized memorial services for Kennedy were held throughout the world, allowing many to express their grief. Governments ordered flags to half-staff and days of mourning. A day of national mourning and sorrow was declared in the U.S. for Monday, November 25, the day of the state funeral. Several other countries such as Ireland did the same. Throughout the United States, many states declared the day of the funeral a legal holiday.

Not all recreational and sporting events scheduled for November 22 and during the weekend after were canceled. Those that went on shared the sentiment NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle expressed in deciding to play NFL games that weekend: &quot;It has been traditional... to perform in times of great personal tragedy.&quot; After their win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia, players for the Washington Redskins asked Coach Bill McPeak to send the game ball to the White House, thanking Rozelle for allowing the games to be played that weekend, saying that they were &quot;playing... for President Kennedy and in his memory.&quot;

One notable sporting response came from Texas A&amp;M University who traditionally burned a bonfire called the &quot;Aggie Bonfire&quot; (Texas A&amp;M students are known as &quot;Aggies&quot;) the day before a College football game against their rivals, the University of Texas at Austin (UT). The Bonfire is meant to represent Aggie students&#x27; &quot;burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u.&quot;, a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas. The game and Bonfire took place around Thanksgiving every year and the 1963 game was due to take place on November 28 with the bonfire on November 27, just days after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. When Texas A&amp;M heard that the President Kennedy was shot and killed, as a mark of respect, for the first time ever, they called off that year&#x27;s Bonfire and dismantled the stack that was due to burn. One person involved Head Yell Leader Mike Marlowe said that &quot;It is the most we have and the least we can give.&quot; The game went ahead and UT beat A&amp;M 15-13. This was one of the two times ever that the Aggie Bonfire was called off before it was burned. The only other time was in 1999 when the Bonfire collapsed during construction and killed 12 people, a tragedy that led to the end of the Aggie Bonfire altogether.

==Mourning during the funeral==
On the day of Kennedy&#x27;s funeral, November 25, 1963, people around the world attended memorial services. This was a day of national mourning in the United States and in many countries around the world. Events were called off because of the mourning. Town streets were deserted while services were held. Everyone who could followed the proceedings on television. Others heeded the call for the day of national mourning by going to their place of worship for a memorial service. 

Around the world, footage of the funeral procession was sent abroad via satellite. Many schools, offices, stores, and factories in the U.S. were closed. Those that were open scheduled a minute of silence. Others permitted employees time off to attend memorial services. During memorial services, church bells tolled. In some cities police officers attached black mourning bands to their badges.

In many states, governors declared the day of national mourning a legal holiday, allowing banks to close. There was silence across the United States at 12:00 EST (17:00 UTC) for five minutes to mark the start of the funeral.

===Early example of breaking news===
The somber mood across the U.S. during the weekend following Kennedy&#x27;s death was evident on the broadcast airwaves. The assassination of President Kennedy was the longest uninterrupted news event in the history of American television until the September 11 attacks. By 3 p.m. (EST) on November 22, nearly every television station canceled their commercial schedules to stay with around-the-clock news coverage provided by the three U.S. television networks in 1963: ABC, CBS, and NBC. From 3 p.m. that day until November 26, all network entertainment and commercial programming ceased on U.S. television. This coverage was one of the earliest examples of what modern television viewers commonly known as a &quot;breaking news&quot; event. 

Overnights included taped footage of earlier news mixed with a few breaking news items. On Sunday night, NBC broadcast continuous live coverage of mourners passing the flag-draped bier in the Capitol rotunda as an estimated 250,000 people filed by. On November 24, a concert performance of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 2&quot;, with Leonard Bernstein conducting, was telecast by CBS. Near the end of NBC&#x27;s coverage of the assassination and funeral, which ended past 1:00 a.m. ET, November 26, the network broadcast a live special post-midnight concert by the National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the director, Dr. Howard Mitchell, at Constitution Hall.

Many radio stations – even many Top 40 rock and roll outlets – also went commercial-free, with many non-network stations playing nothing but classical and/or easy listening instrumental selections interspersed with news bulletins. (It has been reported, though, that some stations, such as WAPE in Jacksonville, Florida, and other stations in parts of the country where Kennedy was unpopular carried on with their normal programming as usual.) Most stations did return to normal programming on the day after the funeral.

==Tributes==
Tributes to Kennedy abounded in the months following his assassination, particularly in the world of recordings. Many individual radio stations released album compilations of their news coverage of the president&#x27;s murder; ABC News released a two-LP set of its radio news coverage. Major record labels also released tribute albums; at one point there were at least six Kennedy tribute albums available for purchase in record stores, with the most popular being Dickie Goodman&#x27;s &quot;John Fitzgerald Kennedy: The Presidential Years 1960–1963&quot; (20th Century 3127), which climbed to number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and stood as the biggest-selling tribute album of all time until the double-CD tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales thirty-four years later.

Two days after the assassination, and one day before the funeral, a special live television program titled &quot;A Tribute to John F. Kennedy from the Arts&quot; was broadcast by ABC on network television. The program featured dramatic readings from such actors as Christopher Plummer, Sidney Blackmer, Florence Eldridge, Albert Finney, and Charlton Heston, as well as musical selections performed by such artists as Marian Anderson. Actor Fredric March, Eldridge&#x27;s real-life husband, hosted the program. Plummer and Finney performed Hamlet&#x27;s dying speech (&quot;I am dead, Horatio&quot;) with Finney taking the role of Horatio. The program has never been repeated, nor has it ever been released on video in any form.

Perhaps the most successful Kennedy tribute song released in the months after his assassination (although later hit songs such as &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot; and &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot; also referenced the tragedy) was the controversial &quot;In the Summer of His Years&quot;, introduced by British singer Millicent Martin on a special edition of the BBC-TV comedy series &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, conceived as a somber and respectful tribute to Kennedy. Martin recorded the song soon afterward, and though it was not deemed suitable for single release in the UK, it was released in the U.S. and &quot;Bubbled Under&quot; the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart at No. 104. A cover version by Connie Francis climbed the Hot 100 chart to number 46 in early 1964 despite being banned by a number of major-market radio stations who felt that capitalizing on a national tragedy was in poor taste. Other versions of the song were recorded by Toni Arden, Kate Smith, Bobby Rydell, and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson.

Phil Spector&#x27;s Christmas album, &quot;A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector&quot;, was pulled from store shelves at Spector&#x27;s request, having sold terribly since the public was not in the mood for cheery holiday music; it was put back for sale for the 1964 season but did not chart until 1972.

The highly successful 1962 comedy album &quot;The First Family&quot; that parodied the Kennedys was quickly pulled from circulation which remained that way for many years.

Also in Britain, where the publishers of &quot;In the Summer of His Years&quot; refused to allow the song a single release by any British artist, Joe Meek, composer of The Tornado(e)s&#x27; hit &quot;Telstar&quot;, released an instrumental titled &quot;The Kennedy March&quot; on Decca Records, with royalties marked to be sent to Jacqueline Kennedy for her to donate to charity. The Briarwood Singers &quot;Bubbled Under&quot; the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart in December 1963 with a recording of the traditional folk song &quot;He Was a Friend of Mine&quot;, which was later recorded, with new lyrics written specially by Jim McGuinn, in 1965 by the popular American band, The Byrds, on their second album, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;. 

In 1964, songwriter William Spivery penned &quot;Mr. John,&quot; which became popular in the midwestern United States. Topical folksinger Phil Ochs paid tribute to Kennedy in his song, &quot;That Was the President&quot;, written shortly after the assassination, and again two years later in his masterpiece &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, connecting Kennedy and Christ.

<text>A Dictabelt recording from a motorcycle police officer&#x27;s radio microphone stuck in the open position became a key piece of evidence cited by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in their conclusion that there was a conspiracy behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Made on a common Dictaphone-brand dictation machine that recorded sound in grooves pressed into a thin vinyl-plastic belt, the recording gained prominence among Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists following the HSCA&#x27;s 1978 conclusion, based in part on this evidence, that there was a &quot;high probability&quot; that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and that the Kennedy assassination was the result of a conspiracy.

The recording was made from Dallas Police Radio Channel 1, which carried routine police radio traffic; Channel 2 was reserved for special events, such as the presidential motorcade. The open-microphone portion of the recording lasts 5.5 minutes, and begins at about 12:29 p.m. local time, a minute before the assassination. Verbal time stamps were made periodically by the police radio dispatcher and can be heard on the recording.

==House Select Committee on Assassinations==
In December 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had prepared a draft of its final report, concluding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in the assassination. However, after evidence from the Dictabelt recording was made available, the HSCA quickly reversed its conclusion and declared that a second gunman had fired the third of four shots heard. In a January 5, 1980, interview with journalist Earl Golz, HSCA chief counsel G. Robert Blakey later said: &quot;If the acoustics come out that we made a mistake somewhere, I think that would end it [the multiple-shooter theory].&quot; Despite serious criticism of the scientific evidence and the HSCA&#x27;s conclusions, speculation regarding both the Dictabelt and the possibility of a second gunman persisted.

Investigators compared &quot;impulse patterns&quot; (suspected gunshots and associated echos) on the Dictabelt to 1978 test recordings of Carcano rifles fired in Dealey Plaza from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and from a stockade fence on the grassy knoll forward and to the right of the location of the presidential limousine. On this basis, the acoustics firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) concluded that impulse patterns 1, 2, and 4 were shots fired from the Depository, and that there was a 50% chance that impulse pattern 3 was a shot fired from the grassy knoll. Acoustics analysts Mark Weiss and Ernest Aschkenasy of Queens College reviewed the BBN data and concluded that &quot;with the probability of 95% or better, there was indeed a shot fired from the grassy knoll.&quot;

Dr. James E. Barger of BBN testified to the HSCA that his statistical analysis of the impulse patterns captured on the Dallas police recordings showed that the motorcycle with the open microphone was about &quot;120 to 138 feet&quot; behind the presidential limousine at the time the first shot was fired. When the HSCA asked Weiss about the location of the motorcycle with the open microphone—&quot;Would you consider that to be an essential ingredient in the ultimate conclusion of your analysis?&quot;— Weiss answered, &quot;It is an essential component of it, because, if you do not put the motorcycle in the place that it is —the initial point of where it was receiving the [sound of the gunfire]—, and if you do not move it at the velocity at which it is being moved on paper in this re-creation, you do not get a good, tight pattern that compares very well with the observed impulses on the police tape recording.&quot;

Using an amateur film shot of the motorcade, the HSCA concluded that the recording originated from the motorcycle of police officer H. B. McLain, who later testified before the committee that his microphone was usually stuck in the open position. McLain did not hear the actual recording until after his testimony, and upon hearing it, he adamantly denied that the recording came from his motorcycle. He said that the other sounds on the recording did not match any of his movements.

Sirens are not heard on the recording until over two minutes after what is supposed to be the sound of the shooting, even though McLain accompanied the motorcade to Parkland Hospital immediately after the shooting with sirens blaring the whole time. When the sirens are heard on the Dictabelt recording, they rise and recede in pitch (i.e., the Doppler effect) and volume, as if they are passing by. McLain also said that the engine sound was clearly from a three-wheeled motorcycle, not the two-wheeler that he drove. &quot;There&#x27;s no comparison to the two sounds,&quot; he said.

Other audio discrepancies also exist. Crowd noise is not heard on the Dictabelt recording, despite the sounds generated from the many onlookers along Dallas&#x27;s Main Street and in Dealey Plaza (crowd noises can be heard on at least ten channel-2 transmissions from the motorcade). Someone is heard whistling a tune about a minute after the assassination. No one actually heard gunshots on the recording.

The only evidence that HSCA had for a second shooter was the Dictabelt sound recording. Four of the twelve HSCA members dissented to the HSCA&#x27;s conclusion of conspiracy based on the acoustic findings, and a fifth thought a further study of the acoustic evidence was &quot;necessary&quot;. Dissenting members of the committee included Congressmen Samuel L. Devine, Robert W. Edgar, and Harold S. Sawyer. Responding to a question asking how he would handle the Committee&#x27;s report if he were at the Justice Department, Sawyer replied: &quot;I&#x27;d file it in a circular file.&quot;
== Criticism ==
Richard E. Sprague, an expert on photographic evidence of the assassination and a consultant to the HSCA, noted that the amateur film the HSCA relied on showed that there was no motorcycle between those riding alongside the rear of the presidential limousine and H.B. McLain&#x27;s motorcycle, and that other films showed McLain&#x27;s motorcycle was actually 250 feet behind the presidential limousine when the first shot was fired, not 120 to 138 feet. There was also no motorcycle anywhere near the target area.

Adult magazine &quot;Gallery&quot; published a pull-out laminated cardboard recording, like those on the back of Cereal boxes, of the Dictabelt recording in its July 1979 issue. Assassination researcher Steve Barber repeatedly listened to that recording and heard the words &quot;Hold everything secure until the homicide and other investigators can get there&quot; at the point where the HSCA had concluded the assassination shots were recorded. However, those words were spoken by Sheriff Bill Decker about 90 seconds after the assassination, so the shots could not be when the HSCA claimed.

The FBI&#x27;s Technical Services Division studied the acoustical data and issued a report on December 1, 1980 (dated November 19, 1980). The FBI report concluded that the HSCA failed to prove that there were gunshots on the recording and also failed to prove that the recording was made in Dealey Plaza. In fact, using the techniques of the previous investigators, the FBI matched a gunshot recorded in Greensboro, NC in 1979 with the sound that was supposedly a shot from the grassy knoll – purportedly suggesting that the initial investigation&#x27;s methods were invalid.

==National Academy of Sciences==
After the FBI disputed the validity of the acoustic evidence, the Justice Department paid for a review by the National Academy of Sciences, an organization operating with a Title 36 congressional charter.

On May 14, 1982, the panel of experts chaired by Harvard University&#x27;s Norman Ramsey, released the results of their study. The NAS panel unanimously concluded that:
The acoustic analyses do not demonstrate that there was a grassy knoll shot, and in particular there is no acoustic basis for the claim of 95% probability of such a shot.The acoustic impulses attributed to gunshots were recorded about one minute after the President had been shot and the motorcade had been instructed to go to the hospital.Therefore, reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman.&quot;

According to Ramsey, noises on the Dictabelt were &quot;probably static&quot;. Louis Stokes, a member of the United States House of Representatives who chaired the HSCA, commented that the report &quot;raised new and serious questions about our conclusions that need to be resolved.&quot;

Dr. Barger, the HSCA&#x27;s acoustics expert, when asked about this discovery and the NAS analysis, replied,Barber discovered a very weak spoken phrase on the DPD Dictabelt recording that is heard at about the time of the sound impulses we concluded were probably caused by the fourth shot. The NAS Committee has shown to our satisfaction that this phrase has the same origin as the same phrase heard also on the Audograph recording. The Audograph recording was originally made from the channel 2 radio. The common phrase is heard on channel 2 about a minute after the assassination would appear, from the context, to have taken place. Therefore, it would seem . . . that the sounds that we connected with gunfire were made about a minute after the assassination shots were fired. Upon reading the NAS report, we did a brief analysis of the Audograph dub that was made by the NAS Committee and loaned to us by them. We found some enigmatic features of this recording that occur at about the time that individuals react to the assassination. Therefore, we have doubt about the time synchronization of events on that recording, and so we doubt that the Barber hypothesis is proven. The NAS Committee did not examine the several items of evidence that corroborated our original findings, so that we still agree with the House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion that our findings were corroborated

An analysis published in the March 2001 issue of &quot;Science &amp; Justice&quot; by Dr. Donald B. Thomas used a different radio transmission synchronization to put forth the claim that the National Academy of Sciences panel was in error. Thomas&#x27; conclusion, very similar to the HSCA conclusion, was that the gunshot impulses were real to a 96.3% certainty. Thomas presented additional details and support in the November 2001 and September and November 2002 issues. Commenting on Thomas&#x27;s study, G. Robert Blakey said: &quot;This is an honest, careful scientific examination of everything we did, with all the appropriate statistical checks.&quot; 

In 2005, Thomas&#x27; conclusions were rebutted in the same journal. Ralph Linsker and several members of the original NAS team, (Richard Garwin, Herman Chernoff, Paul Horowitz, and Ramsey) reanalyzed the timings of the recordings and reaffirmed in an article in &quot;Science &amp; Justice&quot; the earlier conclusion of the NAS report that the alleged shot sounds were recorded approximately one minute after the assassination.

== Further analysis ==
The United States Department of Justice reviewed the HSCA report and the National Academy of Science&#x27;s study of the sound evidence. It reported to the Judiciary Committee on March 28, 1988, and rebuked the HSCA&#x27;s conclusion of a probable conspiracy.

In 2003, an independent researcher named Michael O&#x27;Dell reported that both the National Academy and Dr. Thomas had used incorrect timelines because they subtracted time for repeated sections when the playback needle got stuck, but didn&#x27;t realize that there were also forward skips. When corrected, these showed the impulses happened too late to be the real shots even with Thomas&#x27;s alternative synchronization. He pointed out that the claim of a 95% or higher probability of a shot from the grassy knoll was logically incorrect. It was a 5% chance of finding a match in random noise and did not consider other possible causes.

A November 2003 analysis paid for by the cable television channel Court TV concluded that the putative gunshot impulses did not match test gunshot recordings fired in Dealey Plaza any better than random noise. In December 2003, Thomas responded by pointing out what he claimed were errors in the November 2003 Court TV analysis.
In 2005, five acoustic experts (Linsker, Garwin, Chernoff, Horowitz, and Ramsey) reinvestigated the acoustic recordings and noted several errors made by Thomas.

In 2013, Professor Larry J. Sabato, Ph.D. commissioned a study on the Dictabelt recording using more modern analytical techniques. The report concluded that the recording did not contain sounds of the assassination gunfire and that it would be of &quot;doubtful utility&quot; as evidence to prove or disprove a conspiracy.

In addition to this, approximately 90% of the witnesses present in Dealey Plaza during the shooting who were cited by the HSCA reported hearing 3 shots or less, while &quot;only a total of four witnesses, out of 178 tabulated, reported shots coming from more than one direction.&quot;

== Digital restoration ==

In 2003, ABC News aired the results of its investigation on a program called &quot;Peter Jennings Reporting: The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy.&quot; Based on computer diagrams and recreations done by Dale K. Myers, it concluded that the sound recordings on the Dictabelt could not have come from Dealey Plaza, and that Dallas Police Officer H.B. McLain was correct in his assertions that he had not yet entered Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination.

In the March 2005 issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, it was reported that Carl Haber and Vitaliy Fadeyev were assigned with the task of digitally restoring Dictabelt 10 by Leslie Waffen from the National Archives. Their method consisted of using sensors to map the microscopic contours of the tracks of old sound recordings without having to play them using a stylus, which would further degrade the sound. Dictabelt 10 was worn from countless playings and cracked due to improper storage.

==Possible origins==
Left unanswered by the professional analyses was the question of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the Dictabelt, if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas Trade Mart, the original destination of President Kennedy&#x27;s motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account for the sound of sirens rushing by.

McLain believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the Trade Mart, who was known for his whistling. When interviewed by author Vincent Bugliosi, the officer acknowledged that his microphone could have been stuck in the open position (he did not recall hearing any transmissions for several minutes), and could later have become unstuck after he followed the motorcade to Parkland Hospital.

<text>Lucy Burns (July 28, 1879 – December 22, 1966) was an American suffragist and women&#x27;s rights advocate. She was a passionate activist in the United States and the United Kingdom, who joined the militant suffragettes. Burns was a close friend of Alice Paul, and together they ultimately formed the National Woman&#x27;s Party.

==Early life and education==

Burns was born in New York to an Irish Catholic family. She was described by fellow National Woman&#x27;s Party member Inez Haynes Irwin as &quot;a woman of twofold ability. She speaks and writes with equal eloquence and elegance. [...] Mentally and emotionally, she is quick and warm. [...] She has intellectuality of a high order; but she overruns with a winning Irishness which supplements that intellectuality with grace and charm; a social mobility of extreme sensitiveness and swiftness.&quot; 

She was a gifted student and first attended Packer Collegiate Institute, or what was originally known as the Brooklyn Female Academy, for second preparatory school in 1890. Packer Collegiate Institute prided itself on &quot;teaching girls to be ladies&quot;, and they emphasized religious education while advocating more liberal ideals such as educating &quot;the mind to habits of thinking with clearness and force.&quot; 

Burns also met one of her lifelong role models, Laura Wylie, while attending Packer Collegiate Institute. Wylie was one of the first women to go to Yale University Graduate School. Burns also attended Columbia University, Vassar College, and Yale University before becoming an English teacher.

Burns taught at Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the educational field, she generally found the experience to be frustrating and wanted to continue her own studies. In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language. 

In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909. Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at Oxford University to study English. Burns was fortunate enough to have a very extensive educational background as her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.

==Early activism==

Burns&#x27;s first major experiences with activism were with the Pankhursts in the United Kingdom from 1909 to 1912. While attending graduate school in Germany, Lucy Burns traveled to England where she met Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. She was so inspired by their activism and charisma that she dropped her graduate studies to stay with them and work in the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, an organization dedicated to fighting for women&#x27;s rights in the United Kingdom. She started selling their newsletter &quot;Votes for Women,&quot; and joined a protest on June 29, 1909, where she was arrested.

Burns was later employed by the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union as a salaried organizer from 1910 to 1912. While working with the Pankhursts in the United Kingdom, Lucy Burns became increasingly passionate about activism and participated in numerous campaigns with the WSPU. She amazed a young Grace Roe, for coming from America to support the movement, even saying she had come to London to be arrested and that it &quot;was a very grave honour.&quot; One of her first major contributions was organizing a parade in Edinburgh as part of the campaign in Scotland in 1909. She was the WSPU Edinburgh organiser for two years.

Burns was an active supporter of the campaign to boycott the 1911 census; she invited suffragettes from residents and non-residents of Edinburgh to a large gathering in the city&#x27;s Cafe Vegetaria on the night of the census, so that they could not be officially registered.

== Prison in Britain ==

Burns was with Jennie Baines, Mary Leigh, Alice Paul, Emily Davison and Mabel Capper trying to stop a Limehouse meeting on the Budget by Lloyd George. In a fracas with a senior police officer led to Burns being described by the magistrate as &quot;setting an extremely bad example&quot; and getting a harsher sentence. While Burns is not a widely known speaker from the woman&#x27;s rights movement, she did make a variety of speeches in marketplaces and on street corners while in Europe. Her activism resulted in numerous court appearances and reports of &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; in the newspapers. In August 1909, she hid with Adela Pankhurst, Alice Paul and Margaret Smith on the roof of the St Andrew&#x27;s Hall in Glasgow she planned to break through the roof and disrupt a political speech by the Earl of Crewe in front of an all-male audience. Burns was again with Alice Paul and Edith New and other suffragettes in Dundee trying to enter a political meeting of Herbert Samuel, MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, unable to gain access Burns then broke police station windows and got a ten-day sentence, where she and others went on hunger strike, damaged the cells and refused to do prison work. Burns and Paul were involved in a stunt at the London Lord Mayor&#x27;s Ball, mingling with guests then approaching Winston Churchill with a hidden banner shouting &quot;How can you dine here while women are starving in prison?&quot; Again this resulted in prison, self-starving and force feeding.

Burns had been given a Hunger Strike Medal &#x27;for Valour&#x27; by WSPU.

== Relationship with Alice Paul ==
While working with the WSPU, Burns first met Alice Paul at a London police station. Both women had been arrested for demonstrating, and Paul introduced herself when she noticed that Burns was wearing an American flag pin on her lapel. The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women&#x27;s movement. 

Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with what they considered the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by Anna Howard Shaw. Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends. Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.

Suffrage historian Eleanor Clift compares the partnership of Paul and Burns to that of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. She notes that they &quot;were opposites in appearance and temperament... [w]hereas Paul appeared fragile, Burns was tall and curvaceous, the picture of vigorous health...unlike Paul, who was uncompromising and hard to get along with, Burns was pliable and willing to negotiate. Paul was the militant; Burns, the diplomat.&quot; 

Despite their stark differences, Paul and Burns worked together so effectively that followers would often describe them as having &quot;one mind and spirit.&quot;. However Paul described Burns as &quot;always more valiant than I was, about a thousand times more valiant by nature.&quot;

==National American Women Suffrage Association==
Upon returning to the United States, Paul and Burns joined the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) as leaders of its Congressional Committee. Both women felt it was critical to hold the political party in power responsible for a federal suffrage amendment. By holding an entire party accountable, Paul and Burns believed that congressmen would be forced to take action or risk losing their seats. This militant tactic was presented by Paul and Burns at the 1912 NAWSA convention in Philadelphia to Anna Howard Shaw and other NAWSA leaders. NAWSA leaders rejected their proposal because they felt any action against the Democratic Party, which had just won the presidential election, was premature at that point. Not willing to back down without a fight, Burns and Paul enlisted the help of Jane Addams, a well-respected and more unorthodox NAWSA leader, to petition their cause to her fellow NAWSA leaders. While the women were forced to tone down their proposal NAWSA leaders did authorize a suffrage parade, which Burns, Paul, and other activists organized as the Woman Suffrage Procession of 1913, occurring the day before Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s first inauguration. NAWSA&#x27;s one stipulation was that Paul and Burns&#x27; Congressional Committee would receive no further funding from NAWSA. While Burns and Paul readily agreed to this stipulation, this event marked the beginning of their divide with NAWSA.

==Congressional Union==

Because of the arguments over tactics and funding, Burns and Paul felt it would be best if they added to NAWSA&#x27;s Congressional Committee and formed a group still associated with NAWSA, but one with its own governing body. This new committee was called the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association. Burns was elected unanimously as an executive member of the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association. In April 1913, NAWSA decided they wanted to distance themselves from the more radical group and no longer allowed their name to be used in the title, so the Congressional Union of the National American Women Suffrage Association was renamed just the Congressional Union. Despite this, Burns and Paul still wanted the Congressional Union to be associated with NAWSA, so they applied for it to be considered a NAWSA auxiliary. The Congressional Union was granted auxiliary membership, but the relationship remained tenuous.

Adding to the growing tensions between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted to give them an ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will make sure you don&#x27;t get reelected. Burns stated &quot;Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.&quot; She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.

NAWSA felt they could no longer tolerate the radical tactics employed and advocated by the Congressional Union, and they wanted to officially sever their ties. Paul and Burns did not want to start a completely separate organization that could potentially rival NAWSA and hinder progress in the movement, so they tried on numerous occasions to initiate negotiations with NAWSA leaders. Despite their efforts, the Congressional Union officially split from NAWSA on February 12, 1914.

Many predicted that this split would do irreparable harm to women&#x27;s campaign for suffrage; the cynics did not discourage Paul and Burns, and they began planning their campaign against the Democrats in the summer of 1914. In addition to confronting the Democratic Party, Burns and Paul had to address displeased members within their own organization; some women were complaining that the Congressional Union was elitist, authoritarian, and undemocratic. Paul believed centralized authority was critical to accomplishing their goals and operating effectively, so they did not make any drastic changes; to appease their members they solicited suggestions and stated &quot;We would be most grateful for any constructive plan which you can lay before us.&quot;

While trying to address both internal and external attacks, the Congressional Union worked to keep the Anthony amendment afloat in 1914. The Anthony amendment, or Mondell Resolution, was a federal amendment for woman&#x27;s suffrage and what would ultimately become the nineteenth amendment. Since their split from NAWSA, Ruth Hanna McCormick had become the chairwoman of NAWSA&#x27;s Congressional Committee. Without consulting the NAWSA Board, she had endorsed the alternative Shafroth-Palmer amendment on their behalf. This posed a huge threat to the work of Burns and Paul because the Shafroth amendment, if passed, would make suffrage a states&#x27; rights only issue. While Burns, Paul, and other women from both the Congressional Union and NAWSA met to address this issue, NAWSA ultimately remained in support of the Shafroth amendment, and the Congressional Union continued its campaign for federal suffrage.

Burns was the first woman to speak before the Congressional delegates in 1914, when the Anthony amendment finally made it out of committee and into the House. While her speech was primarily intended to set the stage for Alice Paul, she also outlined the accomplishments of the Congressional Union. The fact that she was the first to speak at such a critical time for federal suffrage shows not only her courage in the face of opposition, but how well respected she was by her fellow leaders and suffragists. The speeches of Burns and Paul were incredibly important at that time in the movement because they showed politicians that women would unite as a voting bloc.

Following this, the Congressional Union sent two organizers to each of the nine states where women had the right to vote. Burns went to San Francisco, California with suffragist Rose Winslow. Organizing women in these states was not an easy task, and raising adequate funds was found to be particularly troublesome; Burns is quoted as saying &quot;If the women here, however, would only give me the money they are willing to spend on luncheons and dinners I will get along admirably.&quot; Burns spread the message about suffrage in theaters, on the streets, by going door-to-door, and by circulating cartoons and pamphlets. By election time in 1914 the Democratic Party had become an extremely vocal critic of the Congressional Union, and ultimately the Congressional Union claimed responsibility for five Democratic losses.

In 1915 the Congressional Union decided to put its efforts into organizing in every state that did not already have a branch. The goal of this plan was to continue what their 1914 state-by-state campaign had started and make suffrage a national issue with demand in every state. In 1915 Burns also became the editor of the Congressional Union&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Suffragist&quot;. During this time period, NAWSA was experiencing a lot of internal strife. After their convention in 1915, Anna Howard Shaw stepped down as president, and many believed this would be a time for potential reconciliation between the Congressional Union and NAWSA.

Burns and Paul met with NAWSA officials and other women from the Congressional Union at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., on December 17, 1915. NAWSA wanted the Congressional Union to become an affiliate but they had numerous demands—the Congressional Union was to end its anti-Democratic Party campaign and never wage any political campaigns in the future. These demands were viewed as completely unreasonable, and the meeting ended without any reconciliation or possibility of future attempts.

==National Woman&#x27;s Party==

After all of the turmoil of the past few years, Alice Paul announced a radical new plan for 1916—she wanted to organize a woman&#x27;s political party. Burns adamantly supported this plan and on June 5, 6 and 7, 1916 at the Blackstone Theater in Chicago, delegates and female voters met to organize the National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP). Burns and Paul were committed to direct action in fighting for women&#x27;s rights and particularly their right to vote. They were opposed by more conservative suffragists who advocated less militant tactics. NAWSA leaders thought the tactics of the National Woman&#x27;s Party were futile and would alienate Democrats that were sympathetic to suffrage. Membership in the NWP was limited to only enfranchised women, and their sole goal was promoting a federal amendment for woman&#x27;s suffrage.

Burns played a large role in the National Woman&#x27;s Party. She worked in virtually every aspect of the organization at one time or another. Specifically, she was a chief organizer, lobby head, newspaper editor, suffrage educator, teacher, orator, architect of the banner campaign, rallying force, and symbol of the NWP. In Burns &#x27;suffrage schools&#x27;, she taught women how to conduct automobile campaigns, lobby, and work with the press, which they continued during the war. She was savvy with working with the media and supplied two hundred news correspondents with frequent news bulletins.

The National Woman&#x27;s Party led dozens of women to picket the White House in Washington, D.C., as Silent Sentinels beginning in January 1917. A bi-partisan organization, it directed its attacks at the office of the President of the United States, in this case, Woodrow Wilson. Burns also opposed World War I, seeing it as a war led by powerful men that resulted in young men being drafted and giving their lives with little free will. Throughout her career with the National Woman&#x27;s Party, Burns was known to have a bitter sense of injustice and become angry because of the actions of the President or apathetic Americans.

==Life in American jail==
Burns was arrested in 1917 while picketing the White House and was sent to Occoquan Workhouse. In jail, Burns joined Alice Paul and many other women in hunger strikes to demonstrate their commitment to their cause, asserting that they were political prisoners. Burns was prepared for the hunger strikes since she had previously participated in this and been force-fed in prison in Britain with the WSPU. Being imprisoned did not stop Burns&#x27; activism. From within the workhouse she organized protests with other prisoners.

Burns also helped organize and circulate one of the first documents that defined the status of political prisoners. This document described the rights of political prisoners and listed their demands for an attorney, family visits, reading and writing materials, and food from outside the prison. It was circulated through holes in the walls until every suffrage prisoner had signed it. Once prison officials realized what Burns was doing, they had her transferred to a district jail and put in solitary confinement.

After Burns was released, she was quickly rearrested for continuing protests, picketing, and marching at the White House. Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed to make an example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence. Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the &quot;Night of Terror.&quot; The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention. To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards. When they realized Lucy Burns&#x27;s spirit was not going to be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left her that way for the entire night. Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell across from her held their hands above their head and stood in the same position. Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, &quot;I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward I ought to be a village seamstress, instead of a Woman&#x27;s Party organizer.&quot;

After enduring the torture of the &quot;Night of Terror,&quot; the women refused to eat for three days. The guards tried to tempt the women with fried chicken, but this was only viewed as an insult; Burns told the other women &quot;I think this riotous feast which has just passed our doors is the last effort of the institution to dislodge all of us who can be dislodged. They think there is nothing in our souls above fried chicken.&quot;

Realizing something urgent needed to be done or he would potentially have dead prisoners on his hands, the warden moved Burns to another jail and told the remaining women that the strike was over. He also ordered Burns to be force fed. Historian Eleanor Clift recounts that the force feeding of Lucy Burns required &quot;five people to hold her down, and when she refused to open her mouth, they shoved the feeding tube up her nostril.&quot; This treatment was extremely painful and dangerous, causing Burns to have severe nosebleeds. Of the well-known suffragists of the era, Burns spent the most time in jail.

==Final push for American Suffrage==

Burns and other suffragists had been told by the chairman of the House Committee on Suffrage that the House would not pass a suffrage amendment before 1920. To their surprise, it was announced in late 1917 that the House would make a decision on January 10, 1918. The amendment passed in the House by a vote of 274 to 136, and the women of the NWP, including Burns, began working on the 11 additional votes they would need for the amendment to pass in the Senate. Unfortunately on June 27, 1918, the Senate narrowly failed to pass the amendment.

Burns and Paul were utterly enraged, but after coming so close there was no chance that they were going to give up now. They resumed their protests at the White House on August 6, 1918. Once again the women were jailed, exposed to horrendous conditions, and released shortly thereafter. Their focus then was moved to helping pro-suffrage candidates get elected in November. For the first time, the NWP did not give allegiance to one party over another; they supported anyone who was willing to support suffrage, and this cost the Democrats their majority in Congress.

As tensions grew between the suffragists and President Wilson, he realized something had to be done quickly to end the highly publicized protests and clashes between the police and suffragists. He requested that Congress convene for a special session in May 1919. On May 21 the House of Representatives passed the Susan B. Anthony amendment 304 to 89, and on June 4, the Senate passed it 66 to 30. Surprisingly, the suffragists were very subdued at the announcement of this victory. The suffragists battle was not yet over; they still had to make sure three quarters supermajority of the states – which then numbered 48 – ratified the amendment. Finally, on August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the thirty-sixth state to ratify the Anthony amendment, and Burns&#x27; quest for federal suffrage was finally over.
At this point Burns was completely exhausted and quoted as saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do anything more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, and now let them fight for it now. I am not going to fight anymore.&quot; All of her time spent in jail and experiences as a suffragist had left her bitter towards married women and others who didn&#x27;t take action during the suffrage movement. After the women of the United States gained the right to vote, Burns retired from political life and devoted herself to the Catholic Church and her orphaned niece. She died on December 22, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==

Burns was posthumously named an honoree by the National Women&#x27;s History Alliance in 2020.

===&quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;===

In 2004, HBO Films broadcast &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;, chronicling the voting rights movement of Lucy Burns, Alice Paul, and other suffragists. Burns was portrayed by Australian actress Frances O&#x27;Connor.

===&quot;Suffs&quot;===
Burns is featured as a character in the musical &quot;Suffs&quot; with book, music, and lyrics by Shaina Taub, which focuses on the activism of Alice Paul and Burns. Suffs premiered off-Broadway at The Public Theatre in March 2022 and has since begun an open-ended run on Broadway in March 2024. The musical is produced in-part by Hillary Clinton and Malala Yousafzai.

===Lucy Burns Institute===
The Lucy Burns Institute, a nonprofit educational organization located in Madison, Wisconsin, is named after Burns.

===Lucy Burns Museum===
The Lucy Burns Museum opened to the public on January 25, 2020, with a gala opening on May 9, 2020, in Lorton, Virginia, on the former site of the Occoquan Workhouse, also called the Lorton Reformatory, where the &quot;Night of Terror&quot; took place. The exhibits commemorate the activism and sacrifices of suffragists and the 1910s protests by the Silent Sentinels.

<text>Robert Haydon Shebbeare VC (13 January 1827 – 16 September 1860) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
He was educated at King&#x27;s College School, then the junior part of King&#x27;s College London. Philip Salkeld, Shebbeare&#x27;s fellow schoolboy at King&#x27;s College School, was also awarded the Victoria Cross for action on the same day, for his role in the attack on Delhi&#x27;s Kashmir Gate.

==India==
Robert Shebbeare left his middle-class suburban home near London in 1844 at the age of seventeen as a subaltern cadet in the 60th Bengal Native Infantry to make his future in India. After 12 years of ordinary regimental duties, he was eventually caught up in the extraordinary events of the Indian Mutiny where he could achieve something himself. With fellow officers he managed to escape to Delhi, where he was attached to the Guides and took part in most of the action during the long hot summer of 1857, during which he was wounded six times.

In a letter to his mother he wrote: &quot;I was wounded by three bullets on 14 July and again by one on 14 September... In addition to these wounds, two musket balls went through my hat. The first slightly grazed my scalp, giving me a severe headache and making me feel very sick. The second cut through a very thick turban and knocked me down on my face, but without doing me any injury. On the same day and shortly afterwards a ball hit me on the (right) jawbone but glanced off with no worse effect than making me bleed violently and giving me a very mumpish appearance for some days.&quot;

===VC award===
Shebbeare was 30 years old, and a lieutenant in the 60th Bengal Native Infantry, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:
==China==
He raised a new regiment of Mazhabi Sikhs, the 15th Punjab Pioneers, which volunteered for service in China and took part in the advance on Peking in 1860. At the age of 33, after 16 years away from England, having risen from subaltern cadet to captain, having fought in two wars, and having won the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy, he sailed back home from China on the SS Emau to see his family again. When the ship arrived, his family were all waiting at the quayside to welcome the hero home; only to be told that he had died en route from an illness, probably malaria, and had been buried at sea in the East China Sea.

Robert Shebbeare&#x27;s descendants include Lieutenant Colonel Robert A Shebbeare, and his great great nephew Sir Tom Shebbeare, KCVO.

<doc id="1193763" wikidata="Q804330" url="?curid=1193763" title="Cordillera Blanca">
<text>The Cordillera Blanca (Spanish for &quot;white range&quot;) is a mountain range in Peru that is part of the larger Andes range and extends for between 8°08&#x27; and 9°58&#x27;S and 77°00&#x27; and 77°52&#x27;W, in a northwesterly direction. It includes several peaks over high and 722 individual glaciers. The highest mountain in Peru, Huascarán, at high, is located there.

The Cordillera Blanca lies in the Ancash region and runs parallel to the Santa River valley (also called Callejón de Huaylas in its upper and midsections) on the west. Huascarán National Park, established in 1975, encompasses almost the entire range of the Cordillera Blanca.

Snowmelt from the Cordillera Blanca provides part of northern Peru with its year-round water supply, while 5% of Peru&#x27;s power comes from a hydro-electrical plant located in the Santa River valley. The area of permanent ice cover shrank by about a third between the 1970s and 2006.

== Geography ==
The Cordillera Blanca is the most extensive tropical ice-covered mountain range in the world and has the largest concentration of ice in Peru. It is part of the Cordillera Occidental (the westernmost part of the Peruvian Andes), and trends in a northwesterly direction for 200 km between 8°08&#x27; and 9°58&#x27;S of latitude and 77°00&#x27; and 77°52&#x27; W of longitude. It has five of the most spectacular peaks above 6,000 m in the Peruvian Andes; the highest peak, Huascarán, rises to an elevation of 6,768 m above sea level. The Cordillera Blanca also acts as a continental divide: the Santa River on the west drains into the Pacific Ocean, whereas the Marañón River on the east drains into the Atlantic Ocean.

=== Glaciers ===

Until the 1990s a total of 722 individual glaciers were recognized in this mountain range, covering an area of 723.4 km2. Most were on the western side of the range, where 530 glaciers covered an area of 507.5 km2, while on the eastern side 192 glaciers covered an area of 215.9 km2. Most of the glaciers, 91% of the total, were classified as mountain glaciers (they are generally short and have extremely steep slopes); the rest were classified as valley glaciers, except for one ice cap.

Like all Andean glaciers, the Cordillera Blanca has witnessed a major retreat of its glaciers during the 20th century due to global climate change. Studies have shown a retreat of over 15% since the 1970s. Based on analysis of satellite imagery, in 2003 there were 485 glaciers left, covering an area of 569.6 km2.

=== Lakes ===
Among the most important lakes in the range are the Llanganuco Lakes, which are located on the northern side of Huascarán, and are accessible from the town of Yungay; the deep-turquoise Lake Parón (the biggest lake in the Cordillera Blanca), located just north of Huandoy, accessible from the town of Caraz; Lakes Ichiccocha and Jatuncocha, which are near Artesonraju and Alpamayo and are accessible only by trekking or on horseback from Caraz.

Some other notable lakes are Lake 69, Lake Allicocha, Lake Auquiscocha, Lake Palcacocha, Lake Querococha, and Lake Conococha.

=== Peaks ===
There are several 6,000 m peaks in the Cordillera Blanca with a 400 m topographic prominence, and several other peaks over 5,500 m. Huascarán Sur, the highest, has two commonly quoted heights: 6,746 m from the Peruvian National Geographic Institute (IGN) map and 6,768 m from the Austrian Alpine Club (OeAV) survey map.

=== Hot springs ===
Among the most important hot springs in the area are Monterrey and Chancos, which have been transformed into thermal bath facilities. They are 7 and 27 km respectively from the regional capital, Huaraz.

== Climate ==
The dry season extends from May through September, June and July having the least rain and more stable weather. The data on the chart correspond to the village of Musho (elevation: 3084 m), located at the foot of Huascarán.

== Ecology ==

Flora and fauna in the range have adapted to the climate and elevational range of mountainous areas. Almost all of the Cordillera Blanca is protected by Huascarán National Park.

=== Flora ===
The main types of plant communities present in the area are the vegetation of inter-Andean valleys (xerophytic plants in the lower elevations and shrubs and grassland at the higher elevations) and high-altitude vegetation (Puna grasslands and patches of high Andean forest).

Plants in the range have adapted to the intense solar radiation, low temperatures, and water availability. Most plant species have pubescent leaves, an adaptation that protects the plants from water loss due to the intense solar radiation and low nighttime temperatures of the mountain climate.

Examples of typical vegetation of this area include &quot;Polylepis racemosa, Escallonia resinosa, Alnus acuminata, Senna birostris, Vallea stipularis, Lupinus&quot; spp&quot;., Vaccinium floribundum, Puya raimondii, Calamagrostis vicunarum, Festuca dolichophylla, Jarava ichu,&quot; &quot;Azorella&quot; spp., and &quot;Ranunculus macropetalus&quot;.

=== Fauna ===
More than 120 bird species have been reported in Huascarán National Park. The most notable include the Andean condor, the torrent duck, the puna tinamou, the brown pintail, the Andean crested duck, the white-tufted grebe, the giant coot, and the Andean gull.

Among the mammals reported in the same area are the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the hog-nosed skunk, and the Andean fox.

<text>Radostin Prodanov Kishishev (; born 30 July 1974) is a Bulgarian former professional footballer who works as director of youth/U19 coach of Chernomorets 1919.

Kishishev earned 88 caps for Bulgaria, representing them at Euro 96 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
Kishishev, born in the Bulgarian city of Burgas, began his career with local sides Chernomorets Burgas and Neftochimic Burgas. He then played as a central midfielder in Turkish side Bursaspor between 1997–98 with another Bulgarian footballer, Kostadin Vidolov. He returned to Bulgaria with Litex Lovech, and won the Bulgarian league title with them in 1998 and 1999. During the 1997-98 A PFG season, he was found to have been ineligible for two of Litex&#x27;s games - an away fixture against PFC Velbazhd Kyustendil and a home one vs. Levski Sofia - due to not being properly registered following his transfer from Bursaspor, but despite suffering 3-0 default losses, the team from Lovech won their first title.

===Charlton Athletic===
In the summer of 2000 Kishishev was purchased by newly promoted English Premier League side Charlton Athletic. Initially utilised as a right back, manager Alan Curbishley moved him into the midfield position where Kishishev would establish himself in the team. An almost constant presence throughout most of Charlton&#x27;s seven-year spell in the Premier League, he had a reputation as a hard worker, a warrior and often topped the team on the distance he ran during games, as shown by the Pro Zone statistics system. Kishishev scored two goals during his time at Charlton, with both coming in the 2002/03 season. He netted in games against West Ham, which made him a local hero, and Everton.

===Leeds United loan spell===
After Curbishley left The Valley in 2006, Kishishev&#x27;s appearances in the first team began to wane. He made his last appearance for Charlton in January 2007, after which he was loaned out to struggling Championship side Leeds United. Kishishev impressed many in his short time at Leeds, and got man of the match on his debut which was a 3–2 defeat against Sheffield Wednesday. His arrival at Elland Road coincided with Leeds&#x27; best run of results in the season, but it was too late to save the club from relegation to League One. Leeds wanted to sign Kishishev permanently in the summer but after they were placed into administration a transfer embargo was placed upon them meaning Kishishev had to look elsewhere.

===Leicester City===
Out of contract, Kishishev joined Leicester City of the Championship in June 2007 on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract. A succession of managerial changes, however, meant he was considered surplus to requirements at the Walkers Stadium. 
In all, he made seven league appearances for Leicester as they were relegated at the end of the season. Kishishev was retained by incoming manager Nigel Pearson for the first half of the 2008–09 season, acting as a translator for teammate and fellow countryman Aleksandar Tunchev, and inheriting the number 7 shirt worn by outgoing Iain Hume. On 19 December 2008, Kishishev&#x27;s contract was cancelled by mutual consent having only played one game.

===Return to Leeds===
He was loaned out again to Leeds, Kishishev got an injury very early in his loan, so missed several games, and when he played he struggled for fitness and did not impress like he did in his first loan spell. Manager Dennis Wise&#x27;s departure in early 2008 ended his second spell at Elland Road with Leeds deciding not to renew his loan spell.

===Litex Lovech===

After returning to the Bulgarian team from Lovech, Kishishev quickly established himself as a first choice defender at his former club and captained the team on a number of occasions. On 25 November 2009, he was sent off in the 2–2 away draw against Levski Sofia after an altercation with Brazilian midfielder Zé Soares.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
On 16 July 2010, it was announced that Kishishev had signed a one-year contract with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Kishishev then made his Brighton debut in Brighton&#x27;s opening day of the season 2–1 win over Swindon Town.

In May 2011 the club announced that he would be released at the end of the season following the ending of his current contract, along with five other players.

===Chernomorets Burgas===
In July 2011 Kishishev announced that he wanted to end his career in his hometown club Chernomorets Burgas. He decided to retire at the end of the season. From 20 November 2012 until May 2014 he was director of football in Chernomorets Burgas.

==International career==
Kishishev was part of the Bulgaria national team that qualified for Euro 96 and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

On 5 September 2009, he scored his first international goal in a World Cup qualifier against Montenegro, tying the scoring in the 4–1 home win.

<doc id="1193766" wikidata="Q3141816" url="?curid=1193766" title="Israeli–Palestinian peace process">
<text>Intermittent discussions are held by various parties and proposals put forward in an attempt to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through a peace process. Since the 1970s, there has been a parallel effort made to find terms upon which peace can be agreed to in both this conflict and the wider Arab–Israeli conflict. Notably, the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel included discussions on plans for &quot;Palestinian autonomy&quot;, but did not include any Palestinian representatives. The autonomy plan would later not be implemented, but its stipulations would to a large extent be represented in the Oslo Accords.

Despite the failure of the peace process to produce a final agreement, the international consensus has for decades supported a two-state solution to the conflict, based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and 338. This includes the establishment of an independent Palestinian state under the pre-1967 borders including East Jerusalem and a just resolution to the refugee question based on the Palestinian right of return (in accordance with United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194). This is in contrast to the current situation under the interim agreement of the Oslo Accords in which the Palestinian territories are fragmented under Israeli military control and the Palestinian National Authority has only partial self-rule in Area A of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. A final settlement as stipulated by the Oslo Accords has yet to be reached.

==Background==
For the United States and Israel, the PLO&#x27;s participation in diplomatic negotiations was dependent on its complete disavowal of political violence and full recognition of Israel&#x27;s &quot;right to exist.&quot; This stipulation required the PLO to abandon its objective of reclaiming all of historic Palestine and instead focus on the 22 percent which came under Israeli military control in 1967. By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement. In 1981, Saudi Arabia put forward a plan based on a two-state settlement to the conflict with support from the Arab League. Israeli analyst Avner Yaniv describes Arafat as ready to make a historic compromise at this time, while the Israeli cabinet continued to oppose the existence of a Palestinian state. Yaniv described Arafat&#x27;s willingness to compromise as a &quot;peace offensive&quot; which Israel responded to by planning to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner in order to evade international diplomatic pressure. Israel would invade Lebanon the following year in an attempt to undermine the PLO as a political organization, weakening Palestinian nationalism and facilitating the annexation of the West Bank into Greater Israel.

While the PLO had adopted a program of pursuing a Palestinian state alongside Israel since the mid-1970s, the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence formally consecrated this objective. This declaration, which was based on resolutions from the Palestine National Council sessions in the late 1970s and 1980s, advocated for the creation of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, within the borders set by the 1949 armistice lines prior to June 5, 1967. Following the declaration, Arafat explicitly denounced all forms of terrorism and affirmed the PLO&#x27;s acceptance of UN Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the recognition of Israel&#x27;s right to exist. All the conditions defined by Henry Kissinger for US negotiations with the PLO had now been met.

Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir stood behind the stance that the PLO was a terrorist organization and would not accept it as a negotiating partner. He maintained a strict stance against any concessions, including withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories, recognition of or negotiations with the PLO, and especially the establishment of a Palestinian state. Shamir viewed the U.S. decision to engage in dialogue with the PLO as a mistake that threatened the existing territorial status quo. He argued that negotiating with the PLO meant accepting the existence of a Palestinian state and hence was unacceptable.

The term &quot;peace-process&quot; refers to the step-by-step approach to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Having originally entered into usage to describe the US mediated negotiations between Israel and surrounding Arab countries, notably Egypt, the term &quot;peace-process&quot; has grown to be associated with an emphasis on the negotiation process rather than on presenting a comprehensive solution to the conflict. As part of this process, fundamental issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict such as borders, access to resources, and the Palestinian right of return, have been left to &quot;final status&quot; talks. Such &quot;final status&quot; negotiations along the lines discussed in Madrid in 1991 have never taken place.

===Peace efforts with confrontation states===

There were parallel efforts for peace treaties between Israel and other &quot;confrontation states&quot;: Egypt, Jordan and Syria after the Six-Day war, and Lebanon afterwards. UN resolution 242 was accepted by Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, but rejected by Syria until 1972–1973.

In 1970, US Secretary of State William P. Rogers proposed the Rogers Plan, which called for a 90-day cease-fire, a military standstill zone on each side of the Suez Canal, and an effort to reach agreement in the framework of UN Resolution 242. Israel rejected the plan on 10 December 1969, calling it &quot;an attempt to appease [the Arabs] at the expense of Israel.&quot; The Soviets dismissed it as &quot;one-sided&quot; and &quot;pro-Israeli.&quot; President Nasser rejected it because it was a separate deal with Israel even if Egypt recovered all of Sinai.

No breakthrough occurred even after President Sadat in 1972 surprised most observers by suddenly expelling Soviet military advisers from Egypt and again signaled to the United States government his willingness to negotiate based on the Rogers plan.

==Timeline==
===1949 Armistice Agreements===

The 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine followed by the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War all ended with the February–July 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Those Arab countries insisted explicitly in the agreement texts that the agreed Armistice Demarcation Lines (&#x27;Green Lines&#x27;) should not be construed as political or territorial boundaries, thus aiming to safeguard the right of return of those Palestinians that had fled their homes during the war, and the illegitimacy of Israel&#x27;s use or appropriation of abandoned Palestinian property.

After the 1967 Six-Day War though, in which Israel had conquered, among more, the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza Strip in a pre-emptive surprise-strike against overtly hostile Arab neighbouring countries, top Israeli leaders like Golda Meir, Menachem Begin and Abba Eban have emphasized that returning to the pre-1967 borders would be extremely dangerous for Israel, bordering on &quot;national suicide&quot;.

===Geneva, December 1973===

After the ceasefire on 25 October 1973 ending the Yom Kippur War (surprise attack on Israel on 6 October by Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq assisted by more countries), the U.S. and U.S.S.R. gathered the foreign ministers of Israel, Egypt and Jordan in Geneva in December 1973 to pursue &quot;peace&quot;, firstly disengagement of armed forces, towards fulfilling UNSC Resolution 242 dating from 1967 (&quot;…the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security&quot;). Syria had refused to show up, because Israel and the US refused to also invite the PLO. The short conference facilitated a reconciliation between Israel, Egypt and Syria, but achieved nothing for the Palestinians.

===Camp David, 1978===

A political agreement was signed between Israel and Egypt (notably excluding representatives from the PLO) in 1978, aiming at the establishment of a self-governing authority in the West Bank and Gaza and autonomy for the inhabitants of those lands, as attempt towards &quot;Peace in the Middle East&quot;. &quot;Autonomy&quot; in this case would not mean &quot;self-determination&quot;; Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin however specifically insisted that &quot;on no condition will there be a Palestinian state&quot;.

Meanwhile, Egypt&#x27;s status as the strongest Arab nation capable of challenging Israel militarily meant that its parallel withdrawal from the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Egypt–Israel peace treaty (March 1979) significantly weakened the collective military and diplomatic power of the other Arab countries. It has been argued that this shift essentially eliminated Israel&#x27;s motivation to make concessions in the West Bank, Gaza, or other areas.

===Madrid (1991–93)===

Delegations of Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan accepted the invitation from U.S. President George H. W. Bush and Soviet Union&#x27;s President Mikhail Gorbachev to attend the peace conference in Madrid, late 1991, after the First Gulf War; a team of Palestinians from West Bank and Gaza was also invited and present. Their team included no overt PLO representatives because Israel had vetoed the presence of PLO associates or Palestinians from outside West Bank or Gaza Strip; nevertheless, PLO figures backstage instructed the Palestinian delegation. The agenda was stated as: achieve &quot;peace throughout the region&quot; through direct negotiations between Israel and the Arab states and between Israel and the Palestinians, all along the UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338. More specifically: &quot;interim self-government arrangements&quot; for the Palestinians. This was the first peace effort with all these countries and also &#x27;Palestinians&#x27; gathered face-to-face.

===Oslo (1993-2001)===
While the slow moving Madrid talks were taking place, a series of secret meetings between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were taking place in Oslo, Norway, which resulted in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords between Palestinians and Israel, a plan discussing the necessary elements and conditions for a future Palestinian state &quot;on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338&quot;. The agreement, officially titled the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements (DOP), was signed on the White House lawn on 13 September 1993. The stipulations of the Oslo agreements ran contrary to the international consensus for resolving the conflict; the agreements did not uphold Palestinian self-determination or statehood and repealed the internationally accepted interpretation of UN Resolution 242 that land cannot be acquired by war. With respect to access to land and resources, Noam Chomsky described the Oslo agreements as allowing &quot;Israel to do virtually what it likes.&quot;

Various &quot;transfers of power and responsibilities&quot; in the Gaza Strip and West Bank from Israel to the Palestinians took place in the mid-1990s. The Palestinians achieved self-governance of major cities in the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip. Israel maintained and continues to maintain a presence in the West Bank for what it describes as security reasons. In 2013 Israel still had control of 61% of the West Bank, while the Palestinians had control of civic functions for most of the Palestinian population. Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described the Oslo Accords as legitimizing &quot;the transformation of the West Bank into what has been called a &#x27;cartographic cheeseboard&#x27;.&quot; Indeed, Oslo legitimated the fragmentation of Palestinian population centers by Jewish-only settlements and bypass roads, Israeli checkpoints and military installations. Core to the Oslo Accords was the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the security cooperation it would enter into with the Israeli military authorities in what has been described as the &quot;outsourcing&quot; of the occupation to the PA. Ben-Ami, who participated in the Camp David 2000 talks, described this process: &quot;One of the meanings of Oslo was that the PLO was eventually Israel’s collaborator in the task of stifling the Intifada and cutting short what was clearly an authentically democratic struggle for Palestinian independence.&quot;

After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, the peace process eventually ground to a halt. The settlements&#x27; population almost doubled in the West Bank. Later suicide bombing attacks from Palestinian militant groups and the subsequent retaliatory actions from the Israeli military made conditions for peace negotiations untenable.

===1996–99 agreements===
Newly elected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a new policy following the many suicide attacks by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad since 1993, including a wave of suicide attacks prior to the Israeli elections of May 1996. Netanyahu declared a tit-for-tat policy which he termed &quot;reciprocity,&quot; whereby Israel would not engage in the peace process if Arafat continued with what Netanyahu defined as the Palestinian revolving door policy, i.e., incitement and direct or indirect support of terrorism. The Hebron and Wye Agreements were signed during this period, after Israel considered that its conditions were partially met.

Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron, also known as the Hebron Protocol or Hebron Agreement, began 7 January and was concluded from 15 to 17 January 1997 between Israel and the PLO. The agreement dealt with the redeployment of Israeli military forces in Hebron in accordance with the Oslo Accords, security issues and other concerns.

The Wye River Memorandum was a political agreement negotiated to implement the Oslo Accords, completed on 23 October 1998. It was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. It was negotiated at Wye River, Maryland (at the Wye River Conference Center) and signed at the White House with President Bill Clinton as the official witness. On 17 November 1998, Israel&#x27;s 120-member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Memorandum by a vote of 75–19. The agreement dealt with further redeployments in the West Bank, security issues and other concerns. The memorandum was criticized by major international human rights organizations for its &quot;encouragement&quot; of human rights abuses.

===Camp David 2000 Summit, Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Parameters,&quot; and the Taba talks===

In 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. In May of that year, according to Nathan Thrall, Israel had offered Palestinians 66% of the West Bank, with 17% annexed to Israel, and a further 17% not annexed but under Israeli control, and no compensating swap of Israeli territory. The Israeli prime minister offered the Palestinian leader between 91% and 95% (sources differ on the exact percentage) of the West Bank and the entire Gaza Strip if 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank&#x27;s Jewish settlers) be ceded to Israel. East Jerusalem would have fallen for the most part under Israeli sovereignty, with the exception of most suburbs with heavy non-Jewish populations surrounded by areas annexed to Israel. The issue of the Palestinian right of return would be solved through significant monetary reparations.

Arafat rejected this offer and did not propose a counter-offer. No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and Palestinian demands, even under intense U.S. pressure. Clinton blamed Arafat for the failure of the Camp David Summit. In the months following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J. Mitchell to lead a fact-finding committee that later published the Mitchell Report.

Proposed in the fall of 2000 following the collapse of the Camp David talks, The Clinton Parameters included a plan on which the Palestinian State was to include 94-96% of the West Bank, and around 80% of the settlers were to become under Israeli sovereignty, and in exchange for that, Israel would concede some territory (so called &#x27;Territory Exchange&#x27; or &#x27;Land Swap&#x27;) within the Green Line (1967 borders). The swap would consist of 1–3% of Israeli territory, such that the final borders of the West Bank part of the Palestinian state would include 97% of the land of the original borders.

At the Taba summit (at Taba) in January 2001 talks continued based on the Clinton Parameters. The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map. The proposition removed the &quot;temporarily Israeli controlled&quot; areas from the West Bank and offered a few thousand more refugees than they offered at Camp David to settle into Israel and hoped that this would be considered &quot;implementation&quot; of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194. The Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. However, Barak did not conduct further negotiations at that time; the talks ended without an agreement and the following month the right-wing Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon was elected Israeli prime minister in February 2001.

===The Arab peace initiative and the Roadmap (2002/3)===

The Beirut summit of Arab government leaders took place in March 2002 under the aegis of the Arab League. The summit concluded by presenting a plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres welcomed it and said, &quot;... the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya&quot;, referring to the Netanya suicide attack perpetrated on the previous evening which the Beirut Summit failed to address. Israel was not prepared to enter negotiations as called for by the Arab League plan on the grounds that it did not wish for &quot;full withdrawal to 1967 borders and the right of return for the Palestinian refugees&quot;.
In July 2002, the &quot;quartet&quot; of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia, outlined the principles of a &quot;road map&quot; for peace, including an independent Palestinian state. The road map was released in April 2003 after the appointment of Mahmoud Abbas (AKA Abu Mazen) as the first-ever Palestinian Authority Prime Minister. Both the US and Israel called for a new Prime Minister position, as both refused to work with Arafat anymore.

The plan called for independent actions by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with disputed issues put off until a rapport can be established. In the first step, the Palestinian Authority must &quot;undertake visible efforts on the ground to arrest, disrupt, and restrain individuals and groups conducting and planning violent attacks on Israelis anywhere&quot; and a &quot;rebuilt and refocused Palestinian Authority security apparatus&quot; must &quot;begin sustained, targeted, and effective operations aimed at confronting all those engaged in terror and dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure.&quot; Israel was then required to dismantle settlements established after March 2001, freeze all settlement activity, remove its army from Palestinian areas occupied after 28 September 2000, end curfews and ease restrictions on movement of persons and goods.

===Israeli–Palestinian talks in 2007 and 2008===

From December 2006 to mid-September 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority met 36 times; there were also lower-level talks. In 2007 Olmert welcomed the Arab League&#x27;s re-endorsement of the Arab Peace Initiative. In his bid to negotiate a peace accord and establish a Palestinian state, Olmert proposed a plan to the Palestinians. The centerpiece of Olmert&#x27;s detailed proposal is the suggested permanent border, which would be based on an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank. Olmert proposed annexing at least 6.3% of Palestinian territory, in exchange for 5.8% of Israeli land, with Palestinians receiving alternative land in the Negev, adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as well as territorial link, under Israeli sovereignty, for free passage between Gaza and the West Bank. Israel insisted on retaining an armed presence in the future Palestinian state. Under Abbas&#x27;s offer, more than 60 percent of settlers would stay in place. Olmert, for his part, was presenting a plan in which the most sparsely populated settlements would be evacuated. Olmert and Abbas both acknowledged that reciprocal relations would be necessary, not hermetic separation. They also acknowledged the need to share a single business ecosystem, while cooperating intensively on water, security, bandwidth, banking, tourism and much more. Regarding Jerusalem the leaders agreed that Jewish neighborhoods should remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Arab neighborhoods would revert to Palestinian sovereignty. The Palestinians asked for clarifications of the territorial land swap since they were unable to ascertain what land his percentages affected, since Israeli and Palestinian calculations of the West Bank differ by several hundred square kilometres. For them, in lieu of such clarifications, Olmert&#x27;s 6.3–6.8% annexation might work out closer to 8.5%, 4 times the 1.9% limit the Palestinians argued a swap should not exceed. The talks ended with both sides claiming the other side dropped follow-up contacts.

Following the conflict that erupted between the two main Palestinian parties, Fatah and Hamas, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip, splintering the Palestinian Authority into two polities, each claiming to be the true representatives of the Palestinian people. Fatah controlled the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank and Hamas governed in Gaza. Hostilities between Gaza and Israel increased. Egypt brokered the 2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire, which lasted half a year beginning on 19 June 2008 and lasted until 19 December 2008. The collapse of the ceasefire led to the Gaza War on 27 December 2008.

===2010 direct talks===

In June 2009, reacting to US President Barack Obama&#x27;s Cairo Address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared for the first time conditional support for a future Palestinian state but insisted that the Palestinians would need to make reciprocal gestures and accept several principles: recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people; demilitarization of a future Palestinian state, along with additional security guarantees, including defensible borders for Israel; Palestinians would also have to accept that Jerusalem would remain the united capital of Israel, and renounce their claim to a right of return. He also claimed that Israeli settlements retain a right to growth and expansion in the West Bank. Palestinians rejected the proposals immediately. In September 2010, the Obama administration pushed to revive the stalled peace process by getting the parties involved to agree to direct talks for the first time in about two years. While U.S. President Barack Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went through months of cajoling just to get the parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. The aim of the talks was to forge the framework of a final agreement within one year, although general expectations of a success were fairly low. The talks aimed to put the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to an official end by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish and Palestinian peoples, promoting the idea of everlasting peace and putting an official halt to any further land claims, as well as accepting the rejection of any forceful retribution if violence should reoccur. Hamas and Hezbollah, however threatened violence, especially if either side seemed likely to compromise in order to reach an agreement. As a result, the Israeli government publicly stated that peace couldn&#x27;t exist even if both sides signed the agreement, due to the stance taken by Hamas and Hezbollah. The US was therefore compelled to re-focus on eliminating the threat posed by the stance of Hamas and Hezbollah as part of the direct talk progress. Israel for its part, was skeptical that a final agreement was reached that the situation would change, as Hamas and Hezbollah would still get support to fuel new violence. In addition, the Israeli government rejected any possible agreement with Palestine as long as it refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.

This is in accordance with the principle of the two-state solution, first proposed in the 1980s. The mainstream within the PLO have taken the concept of territorial and diplomatic compromise seriously and have showed serious interest in this. During the 2010 talks, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that the Palestinians and Israel have agreed on the principle of a land swap, but Israel has yet to confirm. The issue of the ratio of land Israel would give to the Palestinians in exchange for keeping settlement blocs is an issue of dispute, with the Palestinians demanding that the ratio be 1:1, and Israel offering less. In April 2012, Mahmoud Abbas sent a letter to Benjamin Netanyahu reiterating that for peace talks to resume, Israel must stop settlement building in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and accept the 1967 borders as a basis for a two-state solution. In May 2012, Abbas reiterated his readiness to engage with the Israelis if they propose &quot;anything promising or positive&quot;. Netanyahu replied to Abbas&#x27; April letter less than a week later and, for the first time, officially recognised the right for Palestinians to have their own state, though as before he declared it would have to be demilitarised, and said his new national unity government furnished a new opportunity to renew negotiations and move forward.

===2013–14 talks===

Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians began on 29 July 2013 following an attempt by United States Secretary of State John Kerry to restart the peace process.

Martin Indyk of the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. was appointed by the US to oversee the negotiations. Indyk served as U.S. ambassador to Israel and assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs during the Clinton administration. Hamas, the Palestinian government in Gaza, rejected Kerry&#x27;s announcement, stating that Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has no legitimacy to negotiate in the name of the Palestinian people.

The negotiations were scheduled to last up to nine months to reach a final status to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by mid-2014. The Israeli negotiating team was led by veteran negotiator Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, while the Palestinian delegation was led by Saeb Erekat, also a former negotiator. Negotiations started in Washington, DC and were slated to move to the King David Hotel in Jerusalem and finally to Hebron. A deadline was set for establishing a broad outline for an agreement by 29 April 2014. On the expiry of the deadline, negotiations collapsed, with the US Special Envoy Indyk reportedly assigning blame mainly to Israel, while the US State Department insisting no one side was to blame but that &quot;both sides did things that were incredibly unhelpful.&quot;

Israel reacted angrily to the Fatah–Hamas Gaza Agreement of 23 April 2014 whose main purpose was reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, the formation of a Palestinian unity government and the holding of new elections. Israel halted peace talks with the Palestinians, saying it &quot;will not negotiate with a Palestinian government backed by Hamas, a terrorist organization that calls for Israel&#x27;s destruction&quot;, and threatened sanctions against the Palestinian Authority, including a previously announced Israeli plan to unilaterally deduct Palestinian debts to Israeli companies from the tax revenue Israel collects for the PA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Abbas of sabotaging peace efforts. He said that Abbas cannot have peace with both Hamas and Israel and has to choose. Abbas said the deal did not contradict their commitment to peace with Israel on the basis of a two-state solution and assured reporters that any unity government would recognize Israel, be non-violent, and bound to previous PLO agreements. Shortly after, Israel began implementing economic sanctions against Palestinians and canceled plans to build housing for Palestinians in Area C of the West Bank. Abbas also threatened to dissolve the PA, leaving Israel fully responsible for both the West Bank and Gaza, a threat that the PA has not put into effect.

Notwithstanding Israeli objections and actions, the new Palestinian Unity Government was formed on 2 June 2014.

===Abbas&#x27; 2014 peace plan===
On 3 September 2014, Abbas presented a new proposal for the peace process to John Kerry. The plan called for nine months of direct talks followed by a three-year plan for Israel to withdraw to the 1967 lines, leaving East Jerusalem as Palestine&#x27;s capital. The resumption of talks was contingent on an Israeli freeze on construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as the release of the final batch of prisoners from the previous talks. The first three months of the plan would revolve around the borders and potential land swaps for the 1967 lines. The following six months would focus on issues including refugees, Jerusalem, settlements, security and water. The US administration rejected the initiative, saying it was opposed to any unilateral move that could negatively impact the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.

Abbas stated that if Israel rejected the claim he would push for charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court over the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. Additionally, if rejected, Abbas stated he would turn to the UN Security Council for a unilateral measure for a Palestinian State. On 1 October 2014, Abbas stated he would be presenting his plan to the UNSC within two to three weeks, with an application to the ICC to follow if it failed to pass the UNSC. In December 2014, Jordan submitted the proposal to the UNSC, which failed when voted on later that month. Later that month as previously threatened, Abbas signed the treaty to join the ICC. Israel responded by freezing NIS 500 million (US$127 million) in Palestinian tax revenues, in response to which, the PA banned the sale in the Palestinian territories of products of six major Israeli companies.

===Trump plan===
Following the inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January 2017, a period of uncertainty regarding a new peace initiative began. In early 2018, some media sources reported the new administration was preparing a new peace initiative for an Israeli-Palestinian deal. The White House unveiled the economic part of the Trump initiative, titled &quot;Peace to Prosperity: The Economic Plan&quot;, in June 2019, and the political portion of the plan in January 2020. Palestinian leaders boycotted and condemned the Bahrain conference in late June 2019 at which the economic plan was unveiled.

In December 2017, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas cut ties with the Trump administration after United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel. The Trump administration further raised Palestinians&#x27; ire when it moved the US embassy to Jerusalem in May 2018, and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid to the Palestinians, citing the PA&#x27;s refusal to take part in the administration&#x27;s peace initiative.

===Munich group===
In February 2020, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the foreign ministers of Egypt, France, Germany and Jordan, the Munich Group, together discussed peace efforts. In July, the same quartet issued a statement declaring that &quot;any annexation of Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 would be a violation of international law&quot; and &quot;would have serious consequences for the security and stability of the region and would constitute a major obstacle to efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive and just peace&quot;. The foreign ministers said they &quot;discussed how to restart a fruitful engagement between the Israeli and the Palestinian side, and offer our support in facilitating a path to negotiations&quot;.

Meeting in Jordan on 24 September the four again called for a resumption of negotiations between the two sides. There will be &quot;no comprehensive and lasting peace without solving the conflict on the basis of the two-state solution&quot;, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi told reporters following the meeting. The four also praised recent deals establishing ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Egypt&#x27;s Sameh Shoukry said the deals are an &quot;important development that would lead to more support and interaction in order to reach a comprehensive peace&quot;. However Palestinians see the two accords as a betrayal.

On 11 January 2021, the group met in Cairo to discuss &quot;possible steps to advance the peace process in the Middle East and create an environment conducive to the resumption of dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israelis.&quot; A joint statement of the quartet confirmed its intention to work with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden. A further meeting is set to be held in Paris.

The four met in Paris on 11 March 2021, with United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland and the European Union Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process, Susanna Terstal. Their statement emphasized the importance of confidence-building measures to promote dialogue, support for the two-state solution and stated that settlement activities violate international law.

On 19 February 2021, at the Munich Security Conference, as well as reaffirming support for a two state solution, the group condemned the expansion of Israeli settlements and the ongoing Palestinian displacement in East Jerusalem, in particular in Sheikh Jarrah.

On 22 September 2022, the group met with Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, and in a statement said &quot;with a view to advancing the Middle East Peace Process towards a just, comprehensive and lasting peace on the basis of the two-state solution&quot;.

===Quartet developments===
In July 2016, the Quartet reported:The continuing policy of settlement construction and expansion in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, designation of land for exclusive Israeli use, and denial of Palestinian development, including the recent high rate of demolitions, is steadily eroding the viability of the two-state solution. This raises legitimate questions about Israel&#x27;s long-term intentions, which are compounded by the statements of some Israeli ministers that there should never be a Palestinian state. In fact, the transfer of greater powers and responsibilities to Palestinian civil authority...has effectively been stopped. It was within this context that the United Nations passed Security Council Resolution 2334 in December 2016 in another bid to address the settlement question. The report was significantly altered to appease Israel and as well as urging Israel to stop its settlement policy, urged Palestine to end incitement to violence.

In a speech to the UN General Assembly in September, 2018, Mahmoud Abbas called Donald Trump&#x27;s policies towards Palestinians an &quot;assault on international law&quot;. He said the US is &quot;too biased towards Israel&quot; indicating that others could broker talks and that the US could participate as a member of the Middle East peace Quartet. Abbas reiterated this position at a UN Security Council meeting on 11 February 2020.

As of 16 September 2020, the UN has not been able to gather the consensus necessary for the Quartet or a group of countries linked to the Quartet to meet. On 25 September 2020, at the UN, Abbas called for an international conference early in 2021 to &quot;launch a genuine peace process.&quot;

On 15 February 2021, the quartet envoys met virtually and agreed to meet on a regular basis to continue their engagement. On 23 March 2021, the Quartet discussed the reviving of &quot;meaningful negotiations&quot; between Israel and the Palestinians who both need &quot;to refrain from unilateral actions that make a two-state solution more difficult to achieve.&quot;

==Views of the peace process==
===Palestinian views on the peace process===

By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement. Israeli historian Ilan Pappe&#x27;s perspective of the Palestinian point of view is that the conflict dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel, and that the conflict has been a fight to uphold the Palestinian right of return as recognized by the UN. Pappe depicts the American and Israeli point of view on the conflict as starting in 1967 with the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip; this point of view considers peace contingent only on a (possibly partial) withdrawal from these areas. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. Slater says acceptance of a two-state solution by the PLO and its leadership developed as early as the 1960s following from a more &quot;maximalist&quot; view which he describes as the &quot;destruction&quot; of Israel and the &quot;liberation&quot; of Palestine. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for a right of return by the Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.

The Palestinians point out to the extensive and continuing Israeli settlement effort in the West Bank restricting the area available to the Palestinian state.

===Israeli views on the peace process===

There are several Israeli views of the peace process. Israel&#x27;s position is that the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, ought to be the negotiating partner in the peace talks, and not Hamas, which has at times engaged with Israel in escalations of the conflict and attacks Israel&#x27;s civilian population.

The violence of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas had convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and that a two-state system is not the answer. Since the break down of negotiations, security has played a less important role in Israeli concerns, trailing behind employment, corruption, housing and other pressing issues. Israeli policy had reoriented to focus on managing the conflict and the associated occupation of Palestinian territory, rather than reaching a negotiated solution. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. According to Slater, during the time when Yitzhak Rabin was in office, the Palestinian Authority largely fulfilled its commitment to combat terrorism. Palestinian security forces, led by Yasser Arafat, collaborated closely with Israeli security forces. This cooperation included joint patrols and efforts to identify and detain extremists and suspected terrorists, often based on lists provided by the Israelis. Pedahzur describes suicide terrorism as influencing the Israeli public&#x27;s view of the value of maintaining forces on the ground in the occupied Gaza Strip. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.

Some Israelis believe that the Gaza Strip is fully controlled by the Hamas who do not want peace with Israel. According to the Israeli view, this limits the ability of the Palestinians to make peace with Israel and enforce it over the long term. Furthermore, in the Israeli view, a violent overtake of the West Bank by the Hamas as a result of the creation of an unstable new state is likely. Lastly, rhetoric from high-ranking Fatah officials promising a full, literal Palestinian right of return into Israel (a position no Israeli government can accept without destroying the Jewish character of Israel) makes peace negotiations more difficult.

===US views on the peace process===

US officials, citizens and lobbying groups hold divergent views on the peace process. All recent US Presidents have maintained a policy that Israel must give up some of the land that it conquered in the 1967 War in order to achieve peace; that the Palestinians must actively prevent terrorism; and that Israel has an unconditional right to exist. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush publicly supported the creation of a new Palestinian state out of most of the current Palestinian territories, based on the idea of self-determination for the Palestinian people, and President Obama continued that policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thought that peace can only be achieved through direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Obama outlined the pursuit of the two-state solution as American policy for achieving Palestinian aspirations, Israeli security, and a measure of stability in the Middle East.

According to the sociologist Mervin Verbit, American Jews are &quot;more right than left&quot; on peace process issues. Verbit found that surveys of American Jews often reflect the view of the poll&#x27;s sponsors. Often it is the wording of the survey questions that bias the outcome (a headline illustrating this point reads &quot;ADL poll shows higher support for Israel than did survey by dovish J Street&quot;). Using survey data from the American Jewish Committee where findings could not be attributed to wording biases, Verbit found American Jews took a rightward shift following the collapse of the Camp David talks in 2000, and the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

The Jordanian-American journalist Rami George Khouri opines that United States is not willing to mediate a just Israeli-Palestinian peace, Instead, to protect Israel, it sends military equipment to the country, which prevents any attempt to address the root causes of tension in the region. This has generated popular resistance groups across the Middle East that routinely attack both US and Israeli targets.

==Major current issues between the two sides==
The core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of settlements in the West Bank, the status of east Jerusalem, the Palestinian refugee right of return, and security. With the PLO&#x27;s recognition of Israel&#x27;s right to exist in 1982, the international community with the main exception of the United States and Israel has been in consensus on a framework for resolving the conflict on the basis of international law. Various UN bodies and the ICJ have supported this position; every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost unanimously in favor of a resolution titled &quot;Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine.&quot; This resolution consistently affirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements, the annexation of East Jerusalem, and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. It also emphasizes the need for an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 and the need for a just resolution to the refugee question on the basis of UN resolution 194.

There remain some activists on the Palestinian side who claim that there are still some positive signs on the Palestinian side, and that Israel should use these to cultivate some positive interactions with the Palestinians, even in spite of Hamas&#x27;s basic opposition to the existence of the Jewish State. Since mid-June 2007, Israel has cooperated with Palestinian security forces in the West Bank at unprecedented levels, thanks in part to United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian National Security Forces and Presidential Guard.

A further concern is whether, as a result of this security argument, Israel will in fact allow the Palestinian community to emerge as a viable and sovereign political unit, a viable and contiguous state. There are also various economic and political restrictions placed on Palestinian people, activities, and institutions which have had a detrimental effect on the Palestinian economy and quality of life. Israel has said repeatedly that these restrictions are necessary due to security concerns, and in order to counteract ongoing efforts which promote terrorism which incite opposition to Israel&#x27;s existence and rights as a country. The key obstacle therefore remains the Israeli demand for security versus Palestinian claims for rights and statehood.

Furthermore, the identification of &#x27;Palestinian&#x27; with &#x27;terrorist&#x27; can be construed as problematic, and Sayigh argues that this association is used as a rationale for maintaining the status quo, and that only by recognising the status of Jewish immigrants as &#x27;settlers&#x27; can we conceptually move forwards.
Nevertheless, there is a range of ulterior motives for Israel&#x27;s denial of Palestinian statehood. If Palestine were declared a state, then immediately, Israel, by its present occupation of the West Bank, will be in breach of the United Nations Charter. Palestine, as a state, could legitimately call upon the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter to remove Israel from the occupied territories. Palestine, as a state, would be able to accede to international conventions and bring legal action against Israel on various matters. Palestine could accede to various international human rights instruments, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It could even join the International Criminal Court and file cases against Israel for war crimes. It would be a tinderbox of a situation that is highly likely to precipitate conflict in the Middle East.

There is a lively debate around the shape that a lasting peace settlement would take (see for example the One-state solution and Two-state solution). Authors like Cook have argued that the one-state solution is opposed by Israel because the very nature of Zionism and Jewish nationalism calls for a Jewish majority state, whilst the two-state solution would require the difficult relocation of half a million Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Palestinian leaders such as Salam Fayyad have rejected calls for a binational state or unilateral declaration of statehood. As of 2010, only a minority of Palestinians and Israelis support the one-state solution. Interest in a one-state solution is growing, however, as the two-state approach fails to accomplish a final agreement.

==Alternative peace proposals==
Another approach was taken by a team of negotiators led by former Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, and former Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo following two and a half years of secret negotiations. On 1 December 2003, the two parties signed an unofficial suggested plan for peace in Geneva (dubbed the Geneva Accord). In sharp contrast to the road map, it is not a plan for a temporary ceasefire but a comprehensive and detailed solution aiming at all the issues at stake, in particular, Jerusalem, the settlements and the refugee problem. It was met with bitter denunciation by the Israeli government and many Palestinians, with the Palestinian Authority staying non-committal, but it was warmly welcomed by many European governments and some significant elements of the Bush Administration, including Secretary of State Colin Powell.

Yet another approach was proposed by a number of parties inside and outside Israel: a &quot;binational solution&quot; whereby Israel would formally annex the Palestinian territories but would make the Palestinian Arabs citizens in a unitary secular state. Championed by Edward Said and New York University professor Tony Judt, the suggestion aroused both interest and condemnation. It was not actually a new idea, dating back as far as the 1920s, but it was given extra prominence by the growing demographic issues raised by a rapidly expanding Arab population in Israel and the territories.

The Elon Peace Plan is a solution for the Arab-Israeli conflict proposed in 2002 by former minister Binyamin Elon. The plan advocates the formal annexation of West Bank and Gaza by Israel and that Palestinians will become either Jordanian citizens or permanent residents in Israel so long as they remained peaceful and law-abiding residents. All these actions should be done in agreement with Jordan and the Palestinian population. This solution is tied to the demographics of Jordan where it is claimed that Jordan is essentially already the Palestinian state, as it has so many Palestinian refugees and their descendants.

An attempt to change the rules was made by Condoleezza Rice and Tzipi Livni when they brought forth the concept of a shelf agreement. The idea was to disengage the linkage between negotiations and actions on the ground. In theory this would allow negotiations until a &quot;shelf agreement&quot; defining peace would be obtained. Such an agreement would not entail implementation. It would just describe what peace is. It would stay on the shelf but eventually will guide the implementation. The difficulty with this notion is that it creates a dis-incentive for Israel to reach such an agreement. The lack of clarity about what happens after agreement is reached will result in insurmountable pressures on Abbas to demand immediate implementation. However, from the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians are not ready to create a stable state, such an implementation process will almost guarantee instability in the Palestinian areas with a possible Hamas takeover as happened in Gaza.

As things stand now this brings the process to another impasse. To avoid it some definition of what happens after a shelf agreement is needed. One possible idea by this essay is to agree ahead of time that following attainment of a final status agreement there will be a negotiated detailed and staged implementation agreement which would define a process which would allow the creation of a stable functional Palestinian state in stages and over time. In August 2013, an indication that such an idea can be acceptable to the Palestinians was given by Mahmud Abbas in a meeting with Meretz MK-s. In the meeting Abbas stated &quot;that there cannot be an interim agreement but only a final status deal that can be implemented in stages&quot;.

==Joint economic effort and development==
Despite the long history of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, a number of peace initiatives that respect the rights of both peoples have been undertaken by people on both sides.

In March 2007, Japan proposed a plan for peace based on common economic development and effort, rather than on continuous wrangling over land. Both sides stated their support. This became the Peace Valley plan, a joint effort of the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments to promote economic cooperation, and new business initiatives which can help both sides work together, and create a better diplomatic atmosphere and better economic conditions. It is mainly designed to foster efforts in the private sector, once governments provide the initial investment and facilities.

<text>Woodside Energy Group Ltd (formerly Woodside Petroleum Ltd) is an Australian petroleum exploration and production company. Woodside is the operator of oil and gas production in Australia and also Australia&#x27;s largest independent dedicated oil and gas company. It is a public company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and has its headquarters in Perth, Western Australia. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Woodside was ranked as the 1328th-largest public company in the world.

==History==
Woodside was incorporated on 26 July 1954. It was originally established as Woodside (Lakes Entrance) Oil Co NL, a no liability company (NL), and named after the small town of Woodside, Victoria. The company was floated by accountant Rees Withers, whose firm serviced a number of small exploration companies in Gippsland where Australia&#x27;s first oil field had been discovered. The company initially struggled to raise funds after a lack of initial success. In 1956, stockbroker Geoff Donaldson, who had underwritten the initial share offer, joined Woodside as chairman. He played a key role in keeping the company afloat in its early years.

Woodside initially focused its exploration activities on Victoria&#x27;s Gippsland Basin. In 1962 the company recruited Nicholas Boutakoff as chief geologist, who turned the company&#x27;s activities towards Western Australia. He correctly hypothesised that the North West Shelf contained petroleum reserves, and in 1962 Woodside applied for exploration licences over a large offshore area. Woodside subsequently joined up with Shell and Burmah Oil to form the original North West Shelf Venture. BHP later replaced Burmah, and with Shell, each became a 40% shareholder in Woodside in 1985. BHP reduced its shareholding to 10% in July 1990. In October 1994, BHP sold its remaining shares while Shell sold down to 34%. In 1995, Woodside moved its head office from Melbourne to Perth.

In 2001 Shell sought to buy out the remaining portion of the company that it did not already own at the time; however, the takeover move was blocked by Treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello, on national interest grounds. In November 2010, Shell reduced its 34% stake to 24%. In November 2017, Shell sold its remaining shares.

In August 2021, Woodside entered into an agreement with BHP to merge the latter&#x27;s oil and gas assets with Woodside. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and has been described by environmentalists as &#x27;a disastrous outcome for Woodside shareholders and [the] climate&#x27;.

In May 2022, the merger with the BHP oil and gas assets was approved by approximately 98% of Woodside shareholders. As of June 2022, the merger was completed and the combined entity was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.

Woodside agreed to buy American natural gas company, Tellurian Inc., for a total enterprise value of US$1.2 billion in July 2024. The following month, Woodside announced it would acquire a &quot;blue ammonia&quot; project in Texas from OCI Global for US$2.35 billion.

==Business overview==
Woodside has exploration, development and operating activities in Australia and a number of international regions including Canada, United States, Senegal, South Korea, New Zealand, Myanmar, Cameroon, Gabon, Morocco and Ireland. Within Australia Woodside operates or is developing a number of liquefied natural gas projects. The company also operates the Enfield, Vincent and Pyrenees oil fields offshore from Exmouth in Western Australia.

===Scarborough project===

Scarborough is the name of the gas field, off the Pilbara coast. The project includes a floating production unit, the drilling of 13 wells, and a pipeline to transport the gas to the onshore Pluto LNG processing facility near Karratha, which will be expanded.

A 2021 study found estimated that the full Scarborough-Pluto project will emit almost 1.4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases over its lifetime. That&#x27;s over three times Australia&#x27;s current annual emissions, and around 14 times WA&#x27;s annual emissions.

Production is expected to begin in 2026. The project has received environmental approval.

===Sunrise LNG development===
The Greater Sunrise gas development lies in the Timor Sea north of Australia and includes the Sunrise and Troubadour fields, which were discovered in 1974. Greater Sunrise is located about north-west of Darwin and south-east of East Timor. Approximately 80% of the fields lie within Australian waters, with the remainder in jointly administered waters. The Greater Sunrise fields have a total contingent dry gas resource of and of condensate. The Sunrise JV participants are Woodside (operator) (33.4%), ConocoPhillips (30%), Shell (26.6%) and Osaka Gas (10%).

In April 2010 Shell&#x27;s floating liquefied natural gas technology was selected by the Sunrise Joint Venture for developing the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea. The Woodside-operated JV is now seeking to engage regulators on the concept selection process.

===Australia Oil===
Woodside owns and operates a number of oil developments offshore Western Australia, including the Ngujima-Yin FPSO, the Pyrenees FPSO, and the Okha FPSO.

===Burrup Hub===
Woodside Energy Group also has Burrup Hub, the largest fossil fuel project currently proposed in Australia, involving the extraction of six untapped gas fields and the drilling of 84 wells off the Western Australian coast.

==Criticism==
In February 2006, the Mauritanian military junta led by Col. Ely Ould Mohamed Vall denounced amendments to an oil contract made by former President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya with Woodside Petroleum. In 2004, Woodside had agreed to invest US$600 million in developing Mauritania&#x27;s Chinguetti offshore oil project. The &quot;controversial&quot; amendments, which Mauritanian authorities declared had been signed &quot;outside the legal framework of normal practice, to the great detriment of our country&quot;, could cost Mauritania up to $200 million a year. In June 2006, the Australian Federal Police were investigating Woodside for allegations of bribery and corruption in Mauritania.

In 2006–2007, as part of the Pluto LNG project, Woodside faced opposition over plans to build an onshore processing plant on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia, as the site is home to significant petroglyphs up to 30,000 years old.

It has been suggested that intense lobbying by Woodside Petroleum contributed to the coalition Howard government&#x27;s initial decision against emissions trading in August 2000. The company also opposed the Rudd Labor government&#x27;s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in 2009.

Woodside is among six companies accused of making deceptive public statements in an attempt to get free carbon permits. The Australian Conservation Foundation says the companies exaggerated in public, but told a different story to their shareholders and investors. In June 2009, the ACF lodged an official complaint with the Federal consumer affairs watchdog asking that the matter be investigated. The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission took no action against the companies.

In April 2011 Australia&#x27;s Fair Work Ombudsman began an investigation into claims that foreign workers were underpaid on two North West Shelf oil rigs operated by Woodside Petroleum. In April 2013, the Federal Court in WA heard allegations that the workers were paid less than $3 an hour to work on the oil rigs. Documents tendered to the court claimed that the four men worked as painters on Woodside rigs on the North West Shelf off northern WA from July 2009 until early 2011.

In the corporation&#x27;s annual offshore performance report, published in mid-2013, the failure of an oil mist detector at Woodside Petroleum&#x27;s Vincent oilfield in Western Australia was caused by faulty wiring and inadequately designed equipment. The issue was identified during a visit by a third party at Woodside&#x27;s largest single source of oil production.

In April 2016, Woodside concealed a 10 500 litre oil spill off the coast of Western Australia, which went on for two months without anyone from the company noticing. Woodside&#x27;s responsibility only came to light after intense public pressure.
In March 2019, Woodside led a lobbying effort to force the Western Australia EPA to abandon new guidelines to protect the climate. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility described the affair as a ‘week of shame.’

In mid-2020, Woodside tried to avoid decommissioning costs by convincing regulators that dumping all the equipment from its Echo-Yodel field, including 400 tonnes of plastic, under the pretence of the waste being an &#x27;artificial reef&#x27;. The same year, after calls to pay over $200 million to clean up an old gas processing facility they had decommissioned, Woodside convinced the government to instead grant them millions of taxpayer dollars, through a shadowy limited tender process, to ‘consult’ on the clean up. Woodside have attracted condemnation for their role in the wiretapping of the East Timor government in order to &quot;force East Timor, one of the poorest countries in the world, to surrender most of the revenues&quot; to Woodside.

===James Price Point gas industrial complex===
The &quot;Save The Kimberley&quot; campaign was an organised protest against Woodside&#x27;s involvement with a proposal to construct the James Price Point gas industrial complex in Western Australia&#x27;s Kimberley region. A protest concert was held at Federation Square in October 2012, followed by a second event in early 2013 at Esplanade Park, Fremantle that featured Bob Brown, former leader of the Australian Greens political party. A march to protest the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the Fremantle concert, and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards. Community blockades of preliminary construction work at the site, as well as mass submissions and actions in the courts, delayed the project&#x27;s progress.

The proposal was eventually abandoned in April 2013 because of protestors and political resistance, including from some local Aboriginal people, but the $1.5 billion social benefits package that had been brokered between the Kimberley Land Council and Woodside, together with its joint-venture partners and the Barnett government, remained an ongoing issue.

Former head of the Kimberley Land Council Wayne Bergmann, who brokered the deal prior to his resignation, controversially demanded in the media: &quot;[We have] no legal right to that deal; it was broached politically and now they [Woodside, the joint-venture partners and the state government] need to honour the bargain.&quot;

As of 15 April 2013, Woodside had paid AU$3.7 million to Aboriginal organisations in accordance with the agreement and a Woodside spokesperson stated that the corporation would &quot;continue to support a range of voluntary social investment activities in the West Kimberley&quot;.

Some shareholders have argued that the directors of Woodside have breached their duties under the Corporations Act by authorizing any payments because the project did not proceed and the local Aboriginal leaders were just being gifted free money that would never be appropriately accounted for, and would not assist any truly disadvantaged person to change their lives for the better.

===Scarborough project===
The Scarborough-Pluto project has been criticised as not being compatible with Australia&#x27;s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 °C this century under the Paris Agreement.

In November 2021, around 50 local people rallied at Karratha to protest against one of the biggest oil and gas developments ever undertaken in Australia, by Woodside and BHP, known as the Scarborough project; The Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation has no role in approving such industrial projects, but there is research being undertaken as to whether increased emissions would affect the ancient rock art of the Dampier Rock Art Precinct on Murujuga.

In June 2022, the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) sought an injunction against Woodside&#x27;s Scarborough gas project due to its potential climate impacts on the Great Barrier Reef. As of August 2024, Woodside now has all primary environmental approvals in place after the ACF agreed to dismiss its legal challenge.

===Additional protests===
Woodside has faced additional opposition from environmental groups.

In 2023, iconic Australian artworks were vandalised with the Woodside logo as a protest against the company&#x27;s &quot;ongoing desecration of Murujuga rock art&quot; in the Burrup area. Other actions have been staged at the company headquarters, including further vandalism and the use of stink bombs. The aim of campaigning, including such actions, was described by a member of Disrupt Burrup Hub as &#x27;to brand Woodside’s Burrup Hub as the most toxic fossil fuel project in the country, and develop messaging around that to create public awareness of the Burrup Hub and its impacts, and to convert that into political pressure to prevent its further expansion.Some of the actions taken by these groups have faced significant backlash, such as a protest staged at CEO Meg O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s private residence, which was widely condemned by academic, political and business leaders as &quot;unacceptable&quot; conduct.

Further media coverage covered Woodside&#x27;s strong support for the 2023 Indigenous Voice referendum, while also not committing to follow its advice.

=== Pride protest ===
Woodside Energy&#x27;s involvement in Pride events has been a subject of controversy within the LGBTQ+ community. In 2019, the company became a major sponsor of Perth&#x27;s PrideFEST, a decision that drew criticism from activists who argued that corporate sponsorship undermines the radical spirit of the Pride movement.

The Rainbow Rebellion group staged a protest in Perth&#x27;s city centre in 2019, criticising Pride WA for prioritising corporate partnerships over political activism. They argued that corporations like Woodside Energy were using Pride events to distract from their harmful environmental practices.

The Western Australian Greens party has also expressed concerns about Woodside&#x27;s involvement in Pride events. In a letter to Pride WA, party leader Brad Pettitt called on the organisation to reconsider its association with the fossil fuel company. Pettit emphasised the devastating impact of climate change on marginalised communities and urged Pride WA to prioritise sponsors who are actively working to address these issues.

<doc id="1193776" wikidata="Q3247321" url="?curid=1193776" title="Nottingham Urban Area">
<text>The Nottingham Built-up Area (BUA), Nottingham Urban Area, or Greater Nottingham is an area of land defined by the Office for National Statistics as built-up land
with a minimum area of 20 hectares (200,000 m2), while settlements within 200 metres of each other are linked. It consists of the city of Nottingham and the adjoining urban areas of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, in the East Midlands of England. It had a total population of 729,977 at the time of the 2011 census. This was an increase of almost 10% since the 2001 census recorded population of 666,358, due to population increases, reductions and several new sub-divisions.

== Geography ==

Greater Nottingham is largely within the three districts of Rushcliffe, Broxtowe and Gedling surrounding the city, though the area spills into the Nottinghamshire district of Ashfield, and also to the Amber Valley and Erewash districts of Derbyshire. The Nottingham Urban Area is, by the ONS&#x27; figures, the 8th largest in England (9th in the UK), with a population size between that of the Tyneside and Sheffield built-up areas, and a total area of .

The Nottingham Urban Area is bounded to the west by a narrow gap between Draycott (to the west of the Breaston urban area sub-division) and Borrowash (to the east of the Derby Urban Area). The Heanor/Ripley and West Hallam north-western extensions have a somewhat tenuous linkage through to the core of Nottingham City largely due to ribbon development, and are in close proximity to other nearby urban areas which together, almost link to Derby from the north.

Sub-divisions do not always match administrative geographic boundaries; the subdivision of Clifton for example is within the Nottingham Unitary Authority city area but is subdivided by the River Trent. The Nottingham subdivision oversteps the city&#x27;s borders at several locations. Together, these two subdivisions exceed the official city population (305,680 in 2011) as a result, even though West Bridgford includes the counts of city suburbs Silverdale and Wilford.

In the 1991 census, Ilkeston was considered outside of the Nottingham Urban Area, and its addition gave the BUA an 8% increase in 2001. This was due to improvements in mapping methodology by the ONS, and is chiefly responsible for the increase in sub-divisions over censuses rather than any large scale &#x27;bricks and mortar&#x27; building, as much of the area between the cities is protected green belt and wedges, restricting actual development.

==Greater Nottingham Partnership/D2N2==
The local authorities collaborate in some ways. The Greater Nottingham Partnership considered &quot;Greater Nottingham&quot; to consist of the City of Nottingham plus the entirety of the Rushcliffe, Broxtowe and Gedling boroughs, along with Hucknall from Ashfield, but no part of Derbyshire, as no Derbyshire council was a member of the Partnership. They together worked as an advisory and lobbying body for projects and decisions involving the region. However it was axed due to funding in 2011 and the D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership is instead assuming those functions with cross-county political and local business support.

==Nottingham-Derby metropolitan area==

The conurbation forms a large part of the Nottingham-Derby metropolitan area, which has an estimated population of 1.5 million.
The urban areas of both Derby and Nottingham are almost continuous with Draycott (part of the Breaston Urban sub-division) being almost continuous with the Borrowash part of the Derby Urban Area.
The Mansfield Urban Area also forms part of this metropolitan area, although it is not continuous with the Nottingham Urban Area. However, it is almost continuous with the Alfreton/South Normanton Built-up area, which had a population of 41,289 according to the last census, with the South Normanton/Pinxton Urban sub-division of the Alfreton Urban Area being almost continuous with the Sutton-in-Ashfield Urban sub-division of the Mansfield Urban Area. The Alfreton Urban Area is also nearly continuous with Ripley part of the Nottingham Urban Area. Other minor urban areas to the west of the Ripley, Heanor and West Hallam sub divisions daisy-chain towards Derby from the north, notably Belper, Kilburn and Crich/Heage. See the maps above for a demonstration of these BUAs in close proximity.

<text>Joe Cortez (born October 13, 1945) is an American former boxing referee who has officiated in many important world title bouts. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Biography==

Cortez is of Puerto Rican descent. He had a successful amateur boxing career, winning various Golden Gloves tournaments from 1960 to 1962. In 1963, Joe turned pro at the age of eighteen. He had a record of ten wins and one defeat as a professional boxer, and the loss was to Georgie Foster from Ohio. He retired from boxing after only eleven professional fights. Cortez moved to Puerto Rico in 1969, working at The El Conquistador Hotel there; he worked his way up to Executive Assistant manager. Living there, he became fluent in Spanish. In 1977, he moved back to New York where he started work as a Casino Operations Manager for the El San Juan Hotel, one of the three properties in Puerto Rico.

Beginning in the 1977, Cortez started working as a referee. During the 1980s, he took on the responsibility to referee some major Championship fights. During this time he was the third man in the ring in several professional Mike Tyson and Roberto Durán fights.

As eminent referees Richard Steele and Mills Lane retired at the dawn of the 21st century, Cortez became one of Nevada and New York&#x27;s preferred boxing referees for world title fights. He has refereed over 170 world title bouts, among which figure the first Oscar De La Hoya-Julio César Chávez meeting, Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe&#x27;s first title fight and the match that saw 45-year-old George Foreman become the oldest World Heavyweight Champion in history. Asked by Telemundo personnel to give a prediction about the first de la Hoya-Chávez meeting prior to the fight taking place, he simply answered &quot;I can&#x27;t make any predictions&quot;, as referees are not allowed to do that before a fight (doing so might indicate favouritism towards one of the combatants).

Cortez still refereed major boxing events, and his catchphrase during pre-fight instructions, &quot;(I am) fair but firm!&quot; (also said as &quot;I&#x27;m fair but I&#x27;m firm!&quot;) is now a registered trademark. Cortez also gives boxing classes and has a website &quot;www.Fairbutfirm.com&quot;, which teaches someone how to become a referee and talk show host.

He appears in the film &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; as the referee in the exhibition bout between Balboa and the fictional champion Mason &quot;The Line&quot; Dixon played by the professional boxer Antonio Tarver, as well as in I Spy with Eddie Murphy and in Play It To The Bone with Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson.

The last &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; that he refereed was Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana in 2010. He called it &quot;one of the most outstanding, skillful and exciting&quot; championship fights that he refereed in his career.

Cortez was inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame in November 1998 and into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2011. He retired from refereeing in September 2012 after Canelo Alvarez vs Josesito Lopez fight, and is currently a boxing analyst for ESPN Sports.

In 2017, Cortez assisted Conor McGregor with his transition to boxing for his super fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. Cortez was acting as the referee during Conor&#x27;s sparring sessions while training for the bout.

In 2020, at the age of 75, Cortez was hospitalized after contracting COVID-19 and pneumonia but said &quot;...I assure my people in Puerto Rico that I will return.”

<doc id="1193780" wikidata="Q668412" url="?curid=1193780" title="Pala Empire">
<text>The Pāla Empire (r. 750–1161 CE) was a medieval Indian empire which originated in the region of Bengal. It is named after its ruling dynasty, whose rulers bore names ending with the suffix &quot;Pāla&quot; (&quot;protector&quot; in Sanskrit). The empire was founded with the election of Gopāla as the emperor of Gauda in late eighth century CE. The Pala stronghold was located in Bengal and eastern Bihar, which included the major cities of Gauḍa, Vikramapura, Pāṭaliputra, Monghyr, Somapura, Ramavati (Varendra), Tāmralipta and Jagaddala.

The Pālas were astute diplomats and military conquerors. Their army was noted for its vast war elephant corps. Their navy performed both mercantile and defensive roles in the Bay of Bengal. At its zenith under emperors Dharmapala and Devapala in the early ninth century, Pala empire was the dominant power in the northern Indian subcontinent, with its territory stretching across the Gangetic plain to include some parts northeastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Dharmapala also exerted a strong cultural influence through Buddhist scholar Atis Dipankar in Tibet, as well as in Southeast Asia. Pala control of North India was ultimately ephemeral, as they struggled with the Gurjara-Pratiharas and the Rashtrakutas for the control of Kannauj and were defeated. After a short-lived decline, Emperor Mahipala I defended imperial bastions in Bengal and Bihar against South Indian Chola invasions. Emperor Ramapala was the last strong Pala ruler, who gained control of Kamarupa and Kalinga. The empire was considerably weakened with many areas engulfed and their heavy dependence on Samantas being exposed through 11th century rebellion. It finally led to the rise of resurgent Hindu Senas as sovereign power in the 12th century and final expulsion of the Palas from Bengal by their hands marking the end of last major Buddhist imperial power in the subcontinent.

The Pala period is considered one of the golden eras of Bengali history. The Palas brought stability and prosperity to Bengal after centuries of civil war between warring divisions. They advanced the achievements of previous Bengali civilisations and created outstanding works of arts and architecture. The Charyapada in Proto-Bengali language was written by Buddhist Mahasiddhas of tantric tradition, which laid the basis of several eastern Indian languages in their rule. Palas built grand Buddhist temples and monasteries (Viharas), including the Somapura Mahavihara and Odantapuri, and patronised the great universities of Nalanda and Vikramashila. The Pala empire enjoyed relations with the Srivijaya Empire, the Tibetan Empire and the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. Islam first arrived in Bengal during this period as a result of flourishing mercantile and intellectual contacts with Middle-East. The Pala legacy is still reflected in Tibetan Buddhism.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
There is no clear evidence for their origin or early history of the Palas. Historians rely on indirect evidence to understand their reign, leading to controversies about their ancestry. A eulogy on the Khalimpur copper plate of Gopala describes his father Vapyata as a &quot;Khanditarati&quot; or &quot;killer of enemies&quot;, and his grandfather Dayitavishnu as &quot;Sarva-vidyavadata&quot; (&quot;all-knowing&quot; in the sense &quot;highly educated&quot;). Whereas as per a contemporary source, Gopala was born in a family of menials or &quot;Dasajivinah&quot;. Tibetan Lama Taranatha in his &quot;History of Buddhism in India&quot; described that Gopala was born of the seed of a certain tree-god from the womb of a kshatriya woman. Niharranjan Ray mentions that this story is connected with totemic lore, and it is a reflection of the society outside of Puranic Brahmanism.

The &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; attests that Varendra (North Bengal) was the fatherland (&quot;Janakabhu&quot;) of the Palas. In Ramacaritam Dharmapala is hailed as the glory of the Samudra Dynasty; Taranatha too suggested a close connection between Dharmapala and the Samudras (Seas), and in the Dharmamangal of Ghanaram there ls the suggestion of a relationship between Dharmapala&#x27;s queen and the Samudras. Niharranjan Ray suggested some possible relationship between the Pala kings and the ocean-going men of Gauda. The &quot;Ballala-Carita&quot; states that the Palas were low Kshatriyas, as well as Ghanaram Chakrabarty in his &quot;Dharmamangala&quot; (both written in the 16th century CE). The &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; also attests the fifteenth Pala emperor, Ramapala, as a Kshatriya. In the story Udayasundari of the poet Sodhdhala, the Pala kings are said to be Kshatriya of the Solar dynasty. According to Nitish Sengupta, such claims of belonging to the legendary Solar dynasty seems to be unreliable and appear to be an attempt to cover up the humble origins of the dynasty. The Pala dynasty has also been branded as Shudra in some sources such as &quot;Manjushri-Mulakalpa&quot;. A medieval writer Abul Fazl going by this tradition described these kings as Kayasthas. According to K. N. Sahay, &quot;we can claim Palas also as Kayasthas&quot;. But modern scholars believe Palas were staunch Buddhists, as their court became a stronghold and their copper plates emphasised Buddhist affiliation.

André Wink mentions that the founder, Gopala was elected, and &quot;definitely not of royal blood but probably of a line of brahmans which transformed itself into kshatriyas&quot;. Wink further describes that as per an Arabic source Pāla was &#x27;not a king of noble origin&#x27;.

=== Establishment ===
After the fall of Shashanka&#x27;s kingdom, the Bengal region was in a state of anarchy. There was no central authority, and there was constant struggle between petty chieftains. The contemporary writings describe this situation as &quot;matsya nyaya&quot; (&quot;fish justice&quot; i.e. a situation where the big fish eat the small fish). Gopala ascended the throne as the first Pala king during these times. The Khalimpur copper plate suggests that the &quot;prakriti&quot; (people) of the region made him the king. Taranatha, writing nearly 800 years later, also writes that he was democratically elected by the people of Bengal. However, his account is in form of a legend, and is considered historically unreliable. The legend mentions that after a period of anarchy, the people elected several kings in succession, all of whom were consumed by the Naga queen of an earlier king on the night following their election. Gopal, however managed to kill the queen and remained on the throne. The historical evidence indicates that Gopala was not elected directly by his citizens, but by a group of feudal chieftains. Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region.

Gopala&#x27;s ascension in 750 CE was a significant political event as several independent chiefs recognised his political authority without any struggle, consolidating his power over the whole of Bengal including Gaur, Varendra and Banga, also extending his rule over parts of Magadha. According to R. C. Majumdar, Gopala ruled till 770 CE.

===Imperial expansion and consolidation===

Gopala&#x27;s empire was greatly expanded by his son Dharmapala and his grandson Devapala. Dharmapala was initially defeated by the Pratihara ruler Vatsaraja. Later, the Rashtrakuta king Dhruva defeated both Dharmapala and Vatsaraja. After Dhruva left for the Deccan region, Dharmapala built a mighty empire in the northern India. He defeated Indrayudha of Kannauj, and installed his own nominee Chakrayudha on the throne of Kannauj. Several other smaller states in North India also acknowledged his suzerainty, as far as Jalandhara. Soon, his expansion was checked by Vatsaraja&#x27;s son Nagabhata II, who conquered Kannauj and drove away Chakrayudha. Nagabhata II then advanced up to Munger and defeated Dharmapala in a pitched battle. Dharmapala was forced to surrender and to seek alliance with the Rashtrakuta emperor Govinda III, who then intervened by invading northern India and defeating Nagabhata II. The Rashtrakuta records show that both Chakrayudha and Dharmapala recognised the Rashtrakuta suzerainty. In practice, Dharmapala gained control over North India after Govinda III left for the Deccan. He adopted the title &quot;Paramesvara Paramabhattaraka Maharajadhiraja&quot;.

Dharmapala was succeeded by his son Devapala, who is regarded as the most powerful Pala Emperor. His expeditions resulted in the invasion of Pragjyotisha (present-day Assam) where the king submitted without giving a fight and the Utkala (present-day Northern Odisha) whose king fled from his capital city. The inscriptions of his successors also claim several other territorial conquests by him, but these are possibly exaggerated (see the Geography section below).

His oldest son, Rajyapala predeceased him, and as so Mahendrapala, his next older son succeeded him. He possibly maintained his father&#x27;s vast territories and carried out further campaigns against the Utkalas and the Hunas. He passed his empire intact to his younger brother Shurapala I, who held sway over a considerably large territory encompassing Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, proven by his Mirzapur copperplate.
What happened in Gopala II&#x27;s rule, the son of Surapala I, is still unknown. After Gopala II, Dharmapala&#x27;s line came to an end for reasons which are not known yet. Dharmapala&#x27;s descendants, if any, were passed over as Dharmapala&#x27;s younger brother, Vakapala&#x27;s lineage assumed the throne.

=== First period of decline ===
Shortly afterwards, the empire gradually started disintegrating. Vakapala&#x27;s grandson and Jayapala&#x27;s son, Vigrahapala I abdicated the throne after a brief rule, and became an ascetic. Vigrahapala&#x27;s son and successor Narayanapala proved to be a weak ruler. During his 54-year long reign, Mihira Bhoja defeated the Palas. Encouraged by the Pala decline, the King Harjara of Assam assumed imperial titles.

Naryanapala&#x27;s son Rajyapala ruled for at least 32 years, and constructed several public utilities and lofty temples. Earlier it was thought that his son Gopala III lost Bengal after a few years of rule, and then ruled only Bihar. However, it has been debunked by his Bhagalpur inscription, in which he granted a Brahmin two villages in &quot;Pundrabardhanabhukti &quot; in Northern Bengal, signalling his control over it. His son and the next king, Vigrahapala II, had to bear the invasions from the Chandelas and the Kalachuris. During his reign, the Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms like Gauda, Radha, Anga and Vanga. Kantideva of Harikela (eastern and southern Bengal) also assumed the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;, and established a separate kingdom, later ruled by the Chandra dynasty. The Gauda state (West and North Bengal) was ruled by the Kamboja Pala dynasty. The rulers of this dynasty also bore names ending in the suffix -pala (e.g. Rajyapala, Narayanapala and Nayapala). However, their origin is uncertain, and the most plausible view is that they originated from a Pala official who usurped a major part of the Pala kingdom along with its capital.

=== Revival under Mahipala I ===

Mahipala I recovered northern and eastern Bengal within three years of ascending the throne in 978 CE. He also recovered his capital, Gauda, which had been lost to he Kambojas. He also recovered the northern part of the present-day Burdwan division. During his reign, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire frequently invaded Bengal from 1021 to 1023 CE to get Ganges water and in the process, succeeded to humble the rulers, acquiring considerable booty. The rulers of Bengal who were defeated by Rajendra Chola were Dharmapal, Ranasur and Govindachandra, who might have been feudatories under Mahipala I of the Pala Dynasty. Rajendra Chola I also defeated Mahipala, and obtained from the Pala king &quot;elephants of rare strength, women and treasure&quot;. Mahipala also gained control of north and south Bihar, probably aided by the invasions of Mahmud of Ghazni, which exhausted the strength of other rulers of North India. He may have also conquered Varanasi and surrounding area, as his brothers Sthirapala and Vasantapala undertook construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Varanasi. Later, the Kalachuri king Gangeyadeva annexed Varanasi after defeating the ruler of Anga, which was probably Mahipala&#x27;s son Nayapala.

=== Second period of decline ===

Nayapala, the son of Mahipala I, defeated the Kalachuri king Karna (son of Ganggeyadeva) after a long struggle. The two later signed a peace treaty at the mediation of the Buddhist scholar Atiśa. During the reign of Nayapala&#x27;s son Vigrahapala III, Karna once again invaded Bengal but was defeated. The conflict ended with a peace treaty, and Vigrahapala III married Karna&#x27;s daughter Yauvanasri. Vigrahapala III was later defeated by the invading Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI. Vigrahapala III also faced another invasion led by the Somavamsi king Mahasivagupta Yayati of Orissa. Subsequently, a series of invasions considerably reduced the power of the Palas. The Varmans occupied eastern Bengal during his reign.

The successor and older son of Vighrahapala III by his wife Yauvanashri, Mahipala II&#x27;s reign is well-documented by Sandhyakar Nandi in &quot;Ramacharitam&quot;. Mahipala II imprisoned his brothers Ramapala and Surapala II, on the suspicion that they were conspiring against him. Soon afterwards, he faced a rebellion of Samantas led by Kaivarta vassal Divya. Divya (or, Dibyak) killed him and occupied the Varendra region. The region remained under the control of his successors Rudak and Bhima. Surapala II escaped to Magadha and died after a short reign. He was succeeded by his brother Ramapala, who launched a major offensive against Divya&#x27;s nephew Bhima. He was supported by his maternal uncle Mathana and cousin Sivarajadeva of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, as well as several feudatory chiefs of south Bihar and south-west Bengal. Ramapala conclusively defeated Bhima, killing him and his family in a cruel manner. Historian Ryosuke Furui noted that Kaivarta rebellion decisively weakened Pala&#x27;s control over subordinate rulers. It also paved the way for their fall in the hands of another power, the Senas, who rose after the event.

=== Revival under Ramapala ===

After gaining control of Varendra, Ramapala tried to revive the Pala empire with some success. He ruled from a new capital at Ramavati, which remained the Pala capital until the dynasty&#x27;s end. He reduced taxation, promoted cultivation and constructed public utilities. He brought Kamarupa and Rar under his control, and forced the Varman king of east Bengal to accept his suzerainty. He also struggled with the Ganga king for control of present-day Orissa; the Gangas managed to annexe the region only after his death. Ramapala maintained friendly relations with the Chola king Kulottunga to secure support against the common enemies: the Ganas and the Chalukyas. He kept the Senas in check but lost Mithila to a Karnat chief named Nanyadeva who formed his own kingdom based out of Mithila. He also held back the aggressive design of the Gahadavala ruler Govindacharndra through a matrimonial alliance, by marrying off his cousin Kumaradevi to the king.

In the region of Magadha, Vallabharāja, an adventurer from Ratanpur led a campaign against the Ramapala with his base of operations in Bodh Gaya. It has been speculated that he was aided in his campaign by Govindachandra of the Gahadavala dynasty. After gaining control of Bodh Gaya he converted to Buddhism and took on the new name, Devaraksita. At this point, he made peace with the Palas by marrying the daughter of Mahana Pala (uncle of Ramapala). His dynasty became known as the Pithipatis.

=== Final decline ===

Ramapala was the final strong Pala Emperor, although his son Kumarapala managed to keep most of his territories. After his death, a rebellion broke out in Kamarupa during his son Kumarapala&#x27;s reign. The rebellion was crushed by Vaidyadeva, minister of Kumarapala. Vaidyadeva also won a naval war in southern Bengal for his liege. but after Kumarapala&#x27;s death, Vaidyadeva practically created a separate kingdom. Kumarapala&#x27;s son, Gopala IV ascended the throne as a child, and according to the Rajibpur copperplate inscription, his uncle Madanpala acted as his regent. Gopala IV either died in battle or was murdered by Madanapala. During Madanapala&#x27;s rule, the Varmans in east Bengal declared independence, and the Eastern Gangas renewed the conflict in Orissa. Madanapala captured Munger from the Gahadavalas, but was defeated by Vijayasena, who gained control of southern and eastern Bengal. Two rulers, named Govindapala and Palapala ruled over the Gaya district from around 1162 CE to 1200 CE, but there is no concrete evidence about their relationship to the imperial Palas. The Pala dynasty was replaced by the Sena dynasty. The descendants of the Palas, who claimed the status of Kshatriya, &quot;almost imperceptibly merged&quot; with the Kayastha caste.

== Geography ==

The borders of the Pala Empire kept fluctuating throughout its existence. Though the Palas conquered a vast region in North India at one time, they could not retain it for long due to constant hostility from the Gurjara-Pratiharas, the Rashtrakutas and other less powerful kings.

No records are available about the exact boundaries of original kingdom established by Gopala, but it might have included almost all of the Bengal region. The Pala empire extended substantially under Dharmapala&#x27;s rule. Apart from Bengal, he directly ruled the present-day Bihar. The kingdom of Kannauj (present-day Uttar Pradesh) was a Pala dependency at times, ruled by his nominee Chakrayudha. While installing his nominee on the Kannauj throne, Dharmapala organised an imperial court. According to the Khalimpur copper plate issued by Dharmapala, this court was attended by the rulers of Bhoja (possibly Vidarbha), Matsya (Jaipur region), Madra (East Punjab), Kuru (Delhi region), Yadu (possibly Mathura, Dwarka or Simhapura in the Punjab), Yavana, Avanti, Gandhara and Kira (Kangra Valley). These kings accepted the installation of Chakrayudha on the Kannauj throne, while &quot;bowing down respectfully with their diadems trembling&quot;. This indicates that his position as a sovereign was accepted by most rulers, although this was a loose arrangement unlike the empire of the Mauryas or the Guptas. The other rulers acknowledged the military and political supremacy of Dharmapala, but maintained their own territories. The poet Soddhala of Gujarat calls Dharmapala an &quot;Uttarapathasvamin&quot; (&quot;Lord of the North&quot;) for his suzerainty over North India.
In Devapala&#x27;s own inscription and in the inscription referring to his reign, he is credited with the subjugation of the Gurjaras, Dravidas, Utkalas, Pragjyotisas, Hunas and the Kambhojas:
* Gurjaras mentioned were no doubt the Pratiharas and it is inferred that the Pratihara king was Mihir Bhoja.
* The dravida king mentioned in the inscriptions was the Pandya King, Sri-Mara Sri-Vallabha.
* Subjugation of Utkalas (Bhauma-Kara dynasty) naturally brought Devapala into geographical contact with the southern peninsula and it wasn&#x27;t unnatural that hostilities developed between the contemporary Pala and Pandya rulers.
* Pragjyotisa or Assam accepted the suzerainty of Devapala and it has been inferred that the king of Assam was either Pralambha or Harjara.
* Majumdar points that Hunas were a principality in Uttarapatha (near Himalayas) and were subjugated by Devapala.
* While these claims may be exaggerated, they cannot be dismissed entirely because the neighboring Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas were weak at the time, and may have been subdued by Devapala.
=== Devapala&#x27;s Territorial Succession ===
His sons and grandson probably managed to keep the core area of the empire intact. However, the empire started disintegrating shortly after. Narayanapala lost control of Assam and Orissa. It was thought he also briefly lost control over Magadha and north Bengal, although it has now been debunked. Gopala III suffered serious reverses at the hands of the Chandra king, and ruled only from a part of northern Bengal. The Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms during the reign of Vigrahapala II. Mahipala recovered parts of Bengal, Bihar and up to Varansi. His successors lost east and south Bengal again. The last strong Pala ruler, Ramapala, gained control of Bengal, Bihar, Assam and parts of Orissa. By the time of Madanapala&#x27;s death, the Pala kingdom was confined to parts of central and east Bihar along with northern Bengal.

== Administration ==

The Pala rule was monarchial. The king was the centre of all power. Pala kings would adopt imperial titles like &quot;Parameshwara&quot;, &quot;Paramvattaraka&quot;, &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. Pala kings appointed Prime Ministers. The Line of Garga served as the Prime Ministers of the Palas for 100 years.
* Garga
* Darvapani (or Darbhapani)
* Someshwar
* Kedarmisra
* Bhatta Guravmisra

Pala Empire was divided into separate &quot;Bhukti&quot;s (Provinces). Bhuktis were divided into &quot;Vishaya&quot;s (Divisions) and &quot;Mandala&quot;s (Districts). Smaller units were &quot;Khandala&quot;, &quot;Bhaga&quot;, &quot;Avritti&quot;, &quot;Chaturaka&quot;, and Pattaka. Administration covered widespread area from the grass root level to the imperial court.

The Pala copperplates mention following administrative posts:

== Culture ==

=== Religion ===

==== Buddhism ====
The Palas were patrons of Mahayana Buddhism. A few sources written much after Gopala&#x27;s death mention him as a Buddhist, but it is not known if this is true. The subsequent Pala kings were definitely Buddhists. Dharmapala made the Buddhist philosopher Haribhadra his spiritual preceptor. He established the Vikramashila monastery and the Somapura Mahavihara. Taranatha also credits him with establishing 50 religious institutions and patronising the Buddhist author Haribhadra. Devapala restored and enlarged the structures at Somapura Mahavihara, which also features several themes from the epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Mahipala I also ordered construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Saranath, Nalanda and Bodh Gaya. The &quot;Mahipala geet&quot; (&quot;songs of Mahipala&quot;), a set of folk songs about him, are still popular in the rural areas of Bengal.

The Palas developed the Buddhist centres of learnings, such as the Vikramashila and the Nalanda universities. Nalanda, considered one of the first great universities in recorded history, reached its height under the patronage of the Palas. Noted Buddhist scholars from the Pala period include Atisha, Santaraksita, Saraha, Tilopa, Bimalamitra, Dansheel, Dansree, Jinamitra, Jnanasrimitra, Manjughosh, Muktimitra, Padmanava, Sambhogabajra, Shantarakshit, Silabhadra, Sugatasree and Virachan.

As the rulers of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s land, the Palas acquired great reputation in the Buddhist world. Balaputradeva, the Sailendra king of Java, sent an ambassador to him, asking for a grant of five villages for the construction of a monastery at Nalanda. The request was granted by Devapala. He appointed the Brahmin Viradeva (of Nagarahara, present-day Jalalabad) as the head of the Nalanda monastery. The Buddhist poet Vajradatta (the author of Lokesvarashataka), was in his court. The Buddhist scholars from the Pala empire travelled from Bengal to other regions to propagate Buddhism. Atisha, for example, preached in Tibet and Sumatra, and is seen as one of the major figures in the spread of 11th-century Mahayana Buddhism.

==== Shaivism ====

The Palas continued to patronise Shaivism, and epigraphic evidence suggests that Mahipala I and Nayapala were initiated as Shaivites by their royal preceptors. Vigrahapala III&#x27;s Amagachi inscription describes him as &quot;devoted to Śiva worship&quot;, and this tradition continued under his successor Ramapala. Poet Sandhyakar Nandi describes Ramapala&#x27;s son Madanapala as a devotee of Shiva.

The Palas supported the Saiva ascetics, typically the ones associated with the Golagi-Math. Besides the images of the Buddhist deities, the images of Vishnu, Siva and Sarasvati were also constructed during the Pala dynasty rule.

Devapala built a temple dedicated to Shiva&#x27;s consort, and Mahipala patronised a Shaivite monastery. A 1026 CE inscription recording renovations of Buddhist structures at Sarnath by Pala princes states that Mahipala I had them built &quot;hundreds&quot; of temples of Shiva, Chitraghanta, and other deities in Varanasi.

Narayanapala&#x27;s Bhagalpur inscription suggests that he built several Shiva temples, and records his grant of a village to Pashupatas. Narayanapala also attended a sacrifice by his Brahmin minister. Nayapala&#x27;s Siyan inscription suggests that he built several temples dedicated to Shiva and his various aspects (such as Bhairava), plus temples dedicated to the Nine Durgas, the Mother Goddess, Vishnu, and Lakshmi. Despite this, it is unlikely that Nayapala had rejected Buddhist teachings, since Taranatha states that he had a Buddhist preceptor.

Madanapala&#x27;s queen Chitramatika, gifted land to a brahmana named Vateshvara-svami Sharma as his remuneration for reciting the Mahabharata.

=== Literature ===
The Palas patronised several Sanskrit scholars, some of whom were their officials. The &quot;Gauda riti&quot; style of composition was developed during the Pala rule. Many Buddhist Tantric works were authored and translated during the Pala rule. Besides the Buddhist scholars mentioned in the Religion section above, Jimutavahana, Sandhyakar Nandi, Madhava-kara, Suresvara and Chakrapani Datta are some of the other notable scholars from the Pala period.

The notable Pala texts on philosophy include &quot;Agama Shastra&quot; by Gaudapada, &quot;Nyaya Kundali&quot; by Sridhar Bhatta and &quot;Karmanushthan Paddhati&quot; by Bhatta Bhavadeva. The texts on medicine include
* &quot;Chikitsa Samgraha&quot;, &quot;Ayurveda Dipika&quot;, &quot;Bhanumati&quot;, &quot;Shabda Chandrika&quot; and &quot;Dravya Gunasangraha&quot; by Chakrapani Datta
* &quot;Shabda-Pradipa&quot;, &quot;Vrikkhayurveda&quot; and &quot;Lohpaddhati&quot; by Sureshwara
* &quot;Chikitsa Sarsamgraha&quot; by Vangasena
* &quot;Sushrata&quot; by Gadadhara Vaidya
* &quot;Dayabhaga&quot;, &quot;Vyavohara Matrika&quot; and &quot;Kalaviveka&quot; by Jimutavahana

Sandhyakar Nandi&#x27;s semi-fictional epic &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; (12th century) is an important source of Pala history.

A form of the proto-Bengali language can be seen in the &quot;Charyapada&quot;s composed during the Pala rule.

=== Art and architecture ===

The Pala school of sculptural art is recognised as a distinct phase of the Indian art, and is noted for the artistic genius of the Bengal sculptors. It is influenced by the Gupta art.

The Pala style was inherited and continued to develop under the Sena Empire. During this time, the style of sculpture changed from &quot;Post-Gupta&quot; to a distinctive style that was widely influential in other areas and later centuries. Deity figures became more rigid in posture, very often standing with straight legs close together, and figures were often heavily loaded with jewellery; they very often have multiple arms, a convention allowing them to hold many attributes and display mudras. The typical form for temple images is a slab with a main figure, rather over half life-size, in very high relief, surrounded by smaller attendant figures, who might have freer tribhanga poses. Critics have found the style tending towards over-elaboration. The quality of the carving is generally very high, with crisp, precise detail. In east India, facial features tend to become sharp.

Much larger numbers of smaller bronze groups of similar composition have survived than from previous periods. Probably the numbers produced were increasing. These were mostly made for domestic shrines of the well-off, and from monasteries. Gradually, Hindu figures come to outnumber Buddhist ones, reflecting the terminal decline of Indian Buddhism, even in east India, its last stronghold.

As noted earlier, the Palas built a number of monasteries and other sacred structures. The Somapura Mahavihara in present-day Bangladesh is a World Heritage Site. It is a monastery with a complex with 177 cells, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings. The gigantic structures of other Viharas, including Vikramashila, Odantapuri, and Jagaddala are the other masterpieces of the Palas. The art of Bengal and Bihar during the Pala dynasty influenced the art of Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Java.

== List of Pala rulers ==

Most of the Pala inscriptions mention only the regnal year as the date of issue, without any well-known calendar era. Because of this, the chronology of the Pala kings is hard to determine. Based on their different interpretations of the various epigraphs and historical records, different historians estimate the Pala chronology as follows:

== Family tree ==





















Note:
* Earlier historians believed that Vigrahapala I and Shurapala I were the two names of the same person. Now, it is known that these two were cousins; they either ruled simultaneously (perhaps over different territories) or in rapid succession.
* AM Chowdhury rejects Govindapala and his successor Palapala as the members of the imperial Pala dynasty.
* According to BP Sinha, the Gaya inscription can be read as either the &quot;14th year of Govindapala&#x27;s reign&quot; or &quot;14th year after Govindapala&#x27;s reign&quot;. Thus, two sets of dates are possible.
* D.K. Ganguly mentions another ruler named Indradumnyapala, who is solely known from local tradition. There is no source of his existence yet.
* A king, Bhimapala also finds a mention in the &quot;Sabdapradipa&quot;. Rajat Sanyal argues that if Govindapala and Palapala are indeed accepted as Pala kings, Bhimapala also should be, provided that he was chronologically close to Ramapala according to the wording of the text. However, both need more historical evidence.
* A king named Gomindrapala finds mention in a manuscript, dated his fourth regnal year. R.C. Majumdar identifies him with Govindapala, while S.K. Saraswati suggests he is a later Pala king.

== Military ==

The highest military officer in the Pala empire was the &quot;Mahasenapati&quot; (commander-in-chief). The Palas recruited mercenary soldiers from a number of kingdoms, including Malava, Khasa, Huna, Kulika, Mithila, Kanrata, Lata, Odra and Manahali. According to the contemporary accounts, the Rashtrakutas had the best infantry, the Gurjara-Pratiharas had the finest cavalry and the Palas had the largest elephant force. The Arab merchant Sulaiman states that the Palas had an army bigger than those of the Balhara (possibly the Rashtrakutas) and the king of Jurz (possibly the Gurjara-Pratiharas). He also states that the Pala army employed 10,000–15,000 men for fuelling and washing clothes. He further claims that during the battles, the Pala king would lead 50,000 war elephants. Sulaiman&#x27;s accounts seem to be based on exaggerated reports; Ibn Khaldun mentions the number of elephants as 5,000.

Since Bengal did not have a good native breed of horses, the Palas imported their cavalry horses from the foreigners, including the Kambojas. They also had a navy, used for both mercantile and defence purposes.

<doc id="1193781" wikidata="Q995884" url="?curid=1193781" title="China–India relations">
<text>China and India have historically maintained peaceful relations for thousands of years of recorded history, but the harmony of their relationship has varied in modern times, after the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, and especially post the Annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The two nations have sought economic cooperation with each other, while frequent border disputes and economic nationalism in both countries are major points of contention.

Cultural and economic relations within China and India date back to ancient times. The Silk Road not only served as a major trade route between India and China, but is also credited for facilitating the spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia. During the 19th century, China was involved in a growing opium trade with the East India Company, which exported opium grown in India. During World War II, both British India and the Republic of China (ROC) played a crucial role in halting the progress of Imperial Japan. After India became independent in 1947, it established relations with the ROC. The modern Sino-Indian diplomatic relationship began in 1950, when India was among the first noncommunist countries to end formal relations with the Republic of China and recognise the PRC as the legitimate government of both Mainland China and Taiwan. China and India are two of the major regional powers in Asia, and are the two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies in the world.

Growth in diplomatic and economic influence has increased the significance of their bilateral relationship. Between 2008 and 2021, China has been India&#x27;s largest trading partner, and the two countries have also extended their strategic and military relations. However, conflict of interest leads to hostility. India has a large trade deficit that is favoured towards China. The two countries failed to resolve their border dispute and Indian media outlets have repeatedly reported Chinese military incursions into Indian territory. And relations between contemporary China and India have been characterised by border disputes, resulting in three military conflicts – the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the border clashes in Nathu La and Cho La in 1967, and the 1987 Sumdorong Chu standoff. Since the late 1980s, both countries have successfully rebuilt diplomatic and economic ties. Since 2013, border disputes have reemerged to take centre stage in the two countries&#x27; mutual relations. In early 2018, the two armies got engaged in a standoff at the Doklam plateau along the disputed Bhutan-China border. Since summer 2020, armed standoffs and skirmishes at multiple locations along the entire Sino-Indian border escalated. A serious clash occurred in the Galwan Valley, resulting in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and many Chinese soldiers. Both countries have steadily established military infrastructure along border areas, including amidst the 2020 China–India skirmishes. Additionally, India remains wary about China&#x27;s strong strategic bilateral relations with Pakistan, and China&#x27;s relations to separatist groups in Northeast India, while China has expressed concerns about Indian military and economic activities in the disputed South China Sea as well as hosting of anti-China activity from Tibetan exiles. Today, the South Asian region is the premier site of intensified great power competition between China and India.

== Geopolitical overview ==
The China–India border straddles the Himalayas, with Nepal and Bhutan acting as buffer states. Parts of the disputed Kashmir region claimed by India (J&amp;K and Ladakh) are claimed and administered by either Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan) or by the PRC (Aksai Chin). The Government of Pakistan, on its maps, shows the Aksai Chin area as mostly within China and labels the boundary &quot;Frontier Undefined&quot;, while India holds that Aksai Chin is illegally occupied by the PRC. China and India also dispute most of Arunachal Pradesh.

Not only is China&#x27;s India policy shaped by greater competition with the United States, but there are also real structural issues in India-China relations that exacerbate discord. These stem largely from China&#x27;s attempts to keep India at arm&#x27;s length in the Indo-Pacific region. There are clear differences in the regional order in Asia that the two countries desire—India seeks a multipolar order, of which India is one of the main poles, while China seeks a single pole, of which India is not a pole at all.

As India strengthens its security ties with the United States and takes a leading role in organizing the Global South, tensions with China persist. China&#x27;s engagement with India&#x27;s neighbors and growing military cooperation with Pakistan further strain India&#x27;s geopolitical landscape. In this volatile landscape, Sino-Indian relations seek a delicate balance between pragmatic economic interests and escalating geopolitical tensions.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Etched carnelian beads of Indus valley origin have been excavated from various archaeological sites in China dating from the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn period (early half of 1st millennium BCE) to the Han and Jin dynasties, indicating early cultural exchanges.

China and India have also had some contact before the transmission of Buddhism. References to a people called the &quot;Chinas&quot;, are found in ancient Indian literature. The Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (c. 5th century BCE) contains references to &quot;China&quot;, which may have been referring to the Qin state which later became the Qin dynasty. Chanakya (c. 350–283 BCE), the prime minister of the Maurya Empire, refers to Chinese silk as &quot;cinamsuka&quot; (Chinese silk dress) and &quot;cinapatta&quot; (Chinese silk bundle) in his &quot;Arthashastra&quot;.

The first records of contact between China and India were written during the 2nd century BCE, especially following the expedition of Zhang Qian to Central Asia (138–114 BCE). Buddhism was transmitted from India to China in the 1st century CE. Trade relations via the Silk Road acted as economic contact between the two regions. In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Zhang Qian (d. 113 BCE) and Sima Qian (145–90 BCE) make references to &quot;Shendu&quot;, which may have been referring to the Indus Valley (the Sindh province in modern Pakistan), originally known as &quot;Sindhu&quot; in Sanskrit. When Yunnan was annexed by the Han dynasty in the 1st century, Chinese authorities reported an Indian &quot;Shendu&quot; community living there.

A Greco-Roman text Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid 1st century AD) describes the annual fair in present-day Northeast India, on the border with China.

From the 1st century onwards, many Indian scholars and monks traveled to China, such as Batuo (fl. 464–495 CE)—first abbot of the Shaolin Monastery—and Bodhidharma—founder of Chan/Zen Buddhism—while many Chinese scholars and monks also traveled to India, such as Xuanzang (b. 604) and I Ching (635–713), both of whom were students at Nalanda University in Bihar. Xuanzang wrote the &quot;Great Tang Records on the Western Regions&quot;, an account of his journey to India, which later inspired Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s Ming dynasty novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. According to some, St. Thomas the Apostle travelled from India to China and back (see Perumalil, A.C. &quot;The Apostle in India&quot;. Patna, 1971: 5–54.)

====Tamil dynasties====


The Cholas maintained a good relationship with the Chinese. Arrays of ancient Chinese coins have been found in the Cholas homeland (i.e. Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, and Pudukkottai districts of Tamil Nadu, India).

Under Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas had strong trading links with the Chinese Song dynasty. The Chola dynasty had strong influence over present-day Indonesia (Sri Vijaya Empire )

Many sources describe Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen school of Buddhism in China, as a prince of the Pallava dynasty.

====Tang and Harsha dynasties====

During the 7th century, Tang dynasty China gained control over large portions of the Silk Road and Central Asia. In 649, the Chinese general Wang Xuance, along with thousands of recruited Tibetan and Nepalese troops, briefly invaded North India and won the battle.

During the 8th century, the astronomical table of sines by the Indian astronomer and mathematician, Aryabhatta (476–550), were translated into the Chinese astronomical and mathematical book of the &quot;Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era&quot; (&quot;Kaiyuan Zhanjing&quot;), compiled in 718 CE during the Tang dynasty. The &quot;Kaiyuan Zhanjing&quot; was compiled by Gautama Siddha, an astronomer and astrologer born in Chang&#x27;an, and whose family was originally from India. He was also notable for his translation of the Navagraha calendar into Chinese.

====Yuan dynasty====
A rich merchant from the Ma&#x27;bar Sultanate, Abu Ali (P&#x27;aehali) 孛哈里 (or 布哈爾 Buhaer), was associated closely with the Ma&#x27;bar royal family. After a fallout with the Ma&#x27;bar family, he moved to Yuan dynasty China and received a Korean woman as his wife and a job from the Emperor. The woman was formerly Sangha&#x27;s wife and her father was 蔡仁揆 Ch&#x27;ae In&#x27;gyu during the reign of 忠烈 Chungnyeol of Goryeo, recorded in the Dongguk Tonggam, Goryeosa and Liu Mengyan&#x27;s 中俺集 Zhong&#x27;anji. Sangha was a Tibetan. Tamil Hindu Indian merchants traded in Quanzhou during the Yuan dynasty. Hindu statues were found in Quanzhou dating to this period.

According to Badauni and Ferishta, the Delhi Sultanate under Muhammad bin Tughluq had ambitions to invade China. There existed a direct trade relationship between China and the Delhi Sultanate. Ibn Battuta mentions that the Yuan Emperor had sent an embassy to Muhammad for reconstruction of a sacked temple at Sambhal.

===Ming dynasty===

Between 1405 and 1433, Ming dynasty China sponsored a series of seven naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He. Zheng He visited numerous Indian kingdoms and ports, including the Malabar coast, Bengal, and Ceylon, the Persian Gulf, Arabia, and later expeditions ventured down as far as Malindi in what is now Kenya. Throughout his travels, Zheng He liberally dispensed Chinese gifts of silk, porcelain, and other goods. In return, he received rich and unusual presents, including African zebras and giraffes. Zheng He and his company paid respect to local deities and customs, and in Ceylon, they erected a monument (Galle Trilingual Inscription) honouring Buddha, Allah, and Vishnu. Bengal sent twelve diplomatic missions to Nanjing between 1405 and 1439.

After the Ming treasure voyages, private Chinese traders continued operating in the eastern Indian Ocean. Chinese junks could frequently be seen in the ports of the Vijayanagara Empire, carrying silks and other products. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam were important, for they provided secure harbors for traders from China. On the other hand, Vijayanagara exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes.

The Mughals may have attempted to reach the Chinese market. According to East India Company official William Hawkins, Emperor Jahangir&#x27;s wardrobe master was ordered to replace a valuable porcelain. To fulfill the task, the wardrobe master traveled to China but found nothing of equivalent value.

=== Qing dynasty ===
The Bhois of Orissa maintained minor maritime trade links with China. This is noted from the Manchu language memorials and edicts depicting contacts under the reign of the Qing dynasty in China, when the Qianlong Emperor received a gift from the Brahmin (Ch. Polomen 婆羅門, Ma. Bolomen) envoy of a ruler whose Manchu name was Birakišora han of Utg’ali (Ch. Wutegali bilaqishila han 烏特噶里畢拉奇碩拉汗), who is described as a ruler in Eastern India. Hence, referring to Birakisore Deva I of Khurda (1736–1793) who styled himself as Gajapati, the ruler of Utkala. Many of the gosains entering Tibet from China passed through his territory when visiting the Jagannath temple at Puri.

The reign of Tipu Sultan in Mysore saw Chinese technology used for sugar production, and sandalwood was exported to China. Tipu&#x27;s and Mysore&#x27;s tryst with silk began in the early 1780s when he received an ambassador from the Qing dynasty-ruled China at his court. The ambassador presented him with a silk cloth. Tipu was said to be enchanted by the item to such an extent that he resolved to introduce its production in his kingdom. He sent a return journey to China, which returned after twelve years.

After the Qing expansion into the Himalayas, there was increased contact with South Asia, which often manifested in the form of tributary relations. The Qing were obliged to defend their subservient state, Badakhshan, against the Afghans and Marathas, though no major clash with the Marathas ever took place. The Afghans gained the initiative and defeated the Marathas at Panipat in 1761. The battle&#x27;s outcome was used by the Afghans to intimidate the Qing.

==== Sino-Sikh War ====
In the 18th to 19th centuries, the Sikh Empire expanded into neighbouring lands. It had annexed Ladakh into the state of Jammu in 1834. In 1841, they invaded Tibet and overran parts of western Tibet. Chinese forces defeated the Sikh army in December 1841, forcing the Sikh army to withdraw, and in turn, entered Ladakh and besieged Leh, where they were, in turn, defeated by the Sikh Army. At this point, neither side wished to continue the conflict, as the Sikhs were embroiled in tensions with the British that would lead up to the First Anglo-Sikh War, while the Chinese were in the midst of the First Opium War. The Sikhs claimed victory. The two parties signed a treaty in September 1842, which stipulated no transgressions or interference in the other country&#x27;s frontiers.

==== British Raj ====

Indian soldiers, known as &quot;sepoys&quot;, who were in British service participated in the First and Second Opium Wars against Qing China. Indian sepoys were also involved in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, in addition to serving as guards in the British colony of Hong Kong and foreign concessions such as the Shanghai International Settlement. The Chinese slur &quot;&quot;Yindu A San&quot; &quot; (印度阿三 - Indian number three) was used to describe Indian soldiers in British service, with some of the popular sentiment rejecting the possibility for Sino-Indian fraternity.

=== Republic of China ===

Hu Shih, the Chinese ambassador to the United States from 1938 to 1942, commented, albeit critically, on India&#x27;s Buddhism almost completely subsuming Chinese society upon its introduction.

ASIA is one. The Himalayas divide, only to accentuate, two mighty civilizations, the Chinese with its communism of Confucius, and the Indian with its individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy barriers can interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the Ultimate and Universal, which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, enabling them to produce all the great religions of the world and distinguishing them from those maritime peoples of the Mediterranean and the Baltic, who love to dwell on the Particular, and to search out the means, not the end, of life.
While never having actually visited India in his lifetime, Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, occasionally spoke and wrote of India as a fellow Asian nation that was likewise subject to harsh Western exploitation, and frequently called for a Pan-Asian united front against all unjust imperialism. In a 1921 speech, Sun stated: &quot;The Indians have long been oppressed by the British. They have now reacted with a change in their revolutionary thinking...There is progress in their revolutionary spirit, they will not be cowed down by Britain.&quot; To this day, there is a prominent street named Sun Yat-sen street in an old Chinatown in Calcutta, now known as Kolkata.

In 1924, on his major tour of several major Chinese cities, giving lectures about using their shared Asian values and traditional spirituality to help together promote world peace, Rabindranath Tagore was invited to Canton by Sun Yat-sen, an invitation which he declined. There was considerably mixed reception to Tagore from the Chinese students and intellectuals. For example, a major Buddhist association in Shanghai stated that for seven hundred years, they had &quot;waited for a message from India&quot;, while others, mostly modernizers and communists, outright rejected his ideals, stating that they did not &quot;want philosophy, we want materialism&quot; and &quot;not wisdom, but power&quot;.

Believing that then-Republican China and British India were &quot;sister nations from the dawn of history&quot; who needed to transform their &quot;ancient friendship into a new camaraderie of two freedom-loving nations&quot;, Jawaharlal Nehru visited China in 1939 as an honored guest of the government. Highly praising both Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Song Meiling, Nehru referred to Chiang as &quot;not only a great Chinese, but a great Asiatic and world figure...one of the top most leaders of the world...a successful general and captain in war&quot;, and Song as &quot;full of vitality and charm...a star hope for the Chinese people...a symbol of China&#x27;s invincibility&quot;. During his visit, Chiang and Nehru shared a bunker one night when Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing in late August, with Chiang recording a favorable impression of Nehru in his diary; the Chiangs also regularly wrote Nehru during his time in prison and even after their 1942 visit to India.

Partially to enlist India&#x27;s aid against both Japanese and Western imperialism in exchange for China&#x27;s support for Indian independence, the Chiangs visited British India in 1942 and met with Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The Chiangs also sought to present their nation as a potential third option for the Indian people to ally themselves with, with public sympathies at the time sharply split between the British and the Japanese, who actively tried to sway India&#x27;s population with pledges to liberate Asia if they would help their efforts against the British. Despite pledges of mutual friendship and future cooperation between the two peoples, Chiang argued that, while Gandhi&#x27;s non-violent resistance was not necessarily invalid for the Indian people, it was an unrealistic worldview on a global context. Gandhi, who had at the time insisted on India refraining from participating in any war unless India was first given complete independence, in turn, later noted that, although &quot;fun was had by all...I would not say that I had learnt anything, and there was nothing that we could teach him.&quot; In their meeting in Calcutta, Jinnah tried to persuade Chiang, who had pressed Britain to relinquish India as soon as possible, of the necessity of establishing a separate nation for Muslims in the subcontinent, to which Chiang, who apparently recognized the Indian National Congress as the sole nationalist force in the country, replied that if ten crores of Muslims could live peacefully with other communities in China, then there was no true necessity as he saw it of a separate state for a smaller population of nine crores of Muslims living in India. While the public reception to the Chiangs was mostly positive, some reacted less favorably to the Chiangs&#x27; presence in India, with Jinnah believing that Chiang Kai-shek lacked proper understanding of Indian society and feeling he was biased in favor of Nehru and Gandhi while neglecting the demands of other religious communities, with his newspaper &quot;Dawn&quot; calling him a &quot;meddlesome marshal&quot;, while other Indian Muslims, such as Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, expressed mistrust for the couple&#x27;s motives, believing that their government wanted to eventually expand its influence to Indochina and the subcontinent after the British departure.

For his part, Chiang apparently believed none of the major Indian leaders could help his government meaningfully. As an ardent nationalist who lived through China&#x27;s internally turbulent years, he felt that Jinnah was &quot;dishonest&quot; and was being used by the British to divide the peoples of India and, by extension, Asia, with he and his wife Song believing that cooperation between Indian religious communities was difficult but possible. At the same time, he also felt genuinely disappointed by Gandhi, with whom he initially had high expectations, and noted afterwards that &quot;he knows and loves only India, and doesn&#x27;t care about other places and peoples&quot;. Having been unable to make Gandhi change his views about satyagraha, even after arguing that some of their enemies, such as the Japanese, would make the preaching of non-violence impossible, Chiang, himself raised a Buddhist, blamed &quot;traditional Indian philosophy&quot; for his sole focus on endurance of suffering rather than revolutionary zeal necessary to rally and unite the Asian peoples. Nevertheless, the Chiangs continued to commit themselves to supporting the Indian independence movement from afar, mostly via diplomacy, with Song Meiling writing to Nehru encouragingly: &quot;We shall leave nothing undone in assisting you to gain freedom and independence. Our hearts are drawn to you, and...the bond of affection between you and us has been strengthened by our visit...When you are discouraged and weary...remember that you are not alone in your struggle, for at all times we are with you in spirit.&quot;

Although their meetings had ended on a positive note, with Gandhi offering to adopt Song as a &quot;daughter&quot; in his ashram if Chiang left her there as his ambassador to India after she asked to be taught about his non-violent principles, and giving her his spinning wheel as a farewell gift, both sides were met with considerable obstacles in the aftermath. After the Chiangs tried to seek U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s help in persuading Winston Churchill to give India independence during the war, Roosevelt suggested splitting India&#x27;s territory in two in the hopes of resolving tensions, to which Song replied that both she and Chiang felt that &quot;India was as indivisible as China&quot;. Gandhi wrote to Chiang shortly afterwards, seeking to clarify his stance: &quot;I need hardly give you my assurance that, as the author of the new move in India, I shall take no hasty action. And whatever action I may recommend will be governed by the consideration that it should not injure China, or encourage Japanese aggression. I am trying to enlist world opinion in favor of a proposition which to me appears self-proved and which must lead to the strengthening of India and China&#x27;s defence.&quot; Chiang sent a cable to Washington upon reading Gandhi&#x27;s letter, and advised Roosevelt that the best course of action would be to &quot;restore complete freedom&quot; to India, but Churchill reportedly threatened to end Britain&#x27;s alliance with China should the Chiangs continue to try to interfere with Indian affairs.

In 1942, a division of the Kuomintang&#x27;s armies entered India as the Chinese Army in India in their struggle against Japanese expansion in Southeast Asia. Dwarkanath Kotnis and four other Indian physicians traveled to war-torn China to provide medical assistance against the Imperial Japanese Army.

==Post independence==
On 15 August 1947, India gained independence from the British. The newly independent India established diplomatic relations with the ROC. On 1 October 1949, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang (the ROC&#x27;s ruling Nationalist Party) and took over Mainland China, establishing the PRC. Soon afterwards, India became a federal, democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950.

===1950s===
India established diplomatic relations with the PRC on 1 April 1950, the first non-communist/socialist nation in Asia to do so. Pakistan continued to recognize the ROC until 1951.

The relationship between India and a newly communist China started out on an optimistic note. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, and Chinese premier Zhou Enlai articulated a vision of an internationalist foreign policy governed by the ethics of the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence). However, there was notable skepticism on the Indian side from the very beginning about Chinese intentions. For example, Bhimrao Ambedkar was surprised that Nehru took Panchsheel seriously, while Acharya Kriplani said that Panchsheel was &quot;born in sin&quot;. Nehru himself was disappointed when it became clear that the two countries had a conflict of interest in Tibet, which had traditionally served as a buffer zone. From the Chinese side, strategists were concerned about the possibility of India continuing to spread its dominance in Asia and the Indian Ocean in the manner of British India.

China viewed Tibet as a part of its territory. The preceding government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek also claimed Tibet as Chinese territory. However, he was unable to re-assert control. Mao saw Indian concern over Tibet as a manifestation of interference in the internal affairs of the PRC. The PRC reasserted control over Tibet and to end Tibetan Buddhism and feudalism, which it did by force of arms in 1950. To avoid antagonizing the PRC, Nehru informed Chinese leaders that India had no political ambitions or territorial ambitions and did not seek special privileges in Tibet, but that traditional trading rights must continue. With Indian support, Tibetan delegates signed an agreement in May 1951 recognizing PRC sovereignty but guaranteeing that the existing political and social system of Tibet would continue.

In October 1954, China and India signed an agreement regarding Tibet, whereby India recognised Tibet as part of China, with China accepting the continuance of the previous trade arrangements. Observers noted the agreement heavily favored China.

It is the popular perception that the catchphrase of India&#x27;s diplomacy with China in the 1950s was &quot;Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai&quot;, which means, in Hindi, &quot;Indians and Chinese are brothers&quot;. Nehru sought to initiate a more direct dialogue between the peoples of China and India in culture and literature. Around then, the Indian artist (painter) Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, who had earlier decorated the pages of the original Constitution of India, was sent to China in 1957 on a Government of India fellowship to establish a direct cross-cultural and inter-civilization bridge. Noted Indian scholar Rahul Sankrityayan and diplomat Natwar Singh were also there, and Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan paid a visit to the PRC.

After signing the 1954 agreement, India published new maps showing defined borders, as it became apprehensive that China might make claims on Indian territory. Two major territorial disputes existed between China and India, which remained dormant until 1959. In the northeast, Indian territory included the Assam Himalayan region up to the McMahon Line, which China did not recognise as a legal boundary. In the western sector, Indian territory inherited from the British Raj included the Aksai Chin plateau, which Chinese maps started showing as Chinese territory in the 1940s, if not earlier. When India discovered that China built a road through the region, border clashes and Indian protests became more frequent. In January 1959, PRC premier Zhou Enlai wrote to Nehru, pointing out that no government in China had accepted as legal the McMahon Line, which the 1914 Simla Convention defined as the eastern section of the border between India and Tibet.

In March 1959, the Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal head of the Tibet, sought sanctuary in Dharmsala, Himachal Pradesh, where he established the Tibetan government-in-exile. Thousands of Tibetan refugees settled in northwestern India. Relations between India and China deteriorated after India provided the Dalai Lama sanctuary.

===1960s===
Border disputes resulted in a short border war between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and India on 20 October 1962. The border clash resulted in an overall defeat of India as the PRC pushed the Indian forces to within 48 km of the Assam plains in the northeast. It also occupied strategic points in the Aksai Chin and Demchok regions of Ladakh, before declaring a unilateral ceasefire on 21 November. It claimed that it withdrew to 20 km behind its contended line of control. India disagreed with the claim.

During the Sino-Indian border conflict, India&#x27;s Communist Party was accused by the Indian government of being pro-PRC, and many of its political leaders were jailed. Subsequently, the Communist Party of India (CPI) split with the leftist section, forming the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 1964.

Relations between the PRC and India deteriorated during the rest of the 1960s and the early 1970s, while China–Pakistan relations improved and Sino-Soviet relations worsened. The PRC backed Pakistan in its 1965 war with India, and issued &quot;ultimatums&quot; threatening military action at its own border. The threats only served to damage Pakistan&#x27;s relations with the western powers. In late 1967, there were two more conflicts between Indian and Chinese forces at their contested border, in Sikkim, known as the Nathu La and Cho La clashes. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, but India came out in a better position than the PRC.The PRC continued an active propaganda campaign against India and supplied ideological, financial, and other assistance to dissident groups, especially to tribes in northeastern India. The PRC accused India of assisting the Khampa rebels in Tibet. Sri Lanka played the role of chief negotiator for the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the Indian territory. Both countries agreed to Colombo&#x27;s proposals.

===1970s===
In August 1971, India signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Co-operation with the Soviet Union. The PRC sided with Pakistan in its December 1971 war with India. Although China strongly condemned India, it did not carry out its veiled threat to intervene on Pakistan&#x27;s behalf. By this time, the PRC had replaced the Republic of China in the UN, where its representatives denounced India as being a &quot;tool of Soviet expansionism.&quot;

India and the PRC renewed efforts to improve relations after Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Congress party lost the 1977 elections to Morarji Desai&#x27;s Janata Party. In 1978, the Indian Minister of External Affairs Atal Bihari Vajpayee made a landmark visit to Beijing, an impetus to both countries to officially re-establish diplomatic relations in 1979. The PRC modified its pro-Pakistan stand on Kashmir and appeared willing to remain silent on India&#x27;s absorption of Sikkim and its special advisory relationship with Bhutan. The PRC&#x27;s leaders agreed to discuss the boundary issue, India&#x27;s priority, as the first step to a broadening of relations. The two countries hosted each other&#x27;s news agencies, and Mount Kailash and Mansarowar Lake in Tibet, the home of the Hindu pantheon, were opened to annual pilgrimages.

===1980s===
In 1981, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Huang Hua, made a landmark visit to New Delhi. PRC Premier Zhao Ziyang concurrently toured Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.

In 1980, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi approved a plan to upgrade the deployment of forces around the Line of Actual Control. India also undertook infrastructural development in disputed areas. In 1984, squads of Indian soldiers began actively patrolling the Sumdorong Chu Valley in Arunachal Pradesh. In the winter of 1986, the Chinese deployed their troops to the Sumdorong Chu before the Indian team could arrive and built a helipad at Wandung. Surprised by the Chinese occupation, India&#x27;s then Chief of Army Staff, General K.Sundarji, airlifted a brigade to the region. Chinese troops could not move any further into the valley and were forced to move away from the valley. By 1987, Beijing&#x27;s reaction was similar to that in 1962 and this prompted many Western diplomats to predict war. However, Indian foreign minister N.D. Tiwari and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi travelled to Beijing to negotiate a mutual de-escalation.

India and the PRC held eight rounds of border negotiations between December 1981 and November 1987. In 1985, the PRC insisted on mutual concessions without defining the exact terms of its &quot;package proposal&quot; or where the actual line of control lay. In 1986 and 1987, the negotiations achieved nothing, given the charges exchanged between the two countries of military encroachment in the Sumdorung Chu Valley. China&#x27;s construction of a military post and helicopter pad in the area in 1986 and India&#x27;s grant of statehood to Arunachal Pradesh (formerly the North-East Frontier Agency) in February 1987 caused both sides to deploy troops to the area. The PRC relayed warnings that it would &quot;teach India a lesson&quot; if it did not cease &quot;nibbling&quot; at Chinese territory. By the summer of 1987, however, both sides had backed away from conflict and denied military clashes had taken place.

A warming trend in relations was facilitated by Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s visit to China in December 1988. The two sides issued a joint communiqué that stressed the need to restore friendly relations on the basis of the Panchsheel. India and the People&#x27;s Republic of China agreed to achieve a &quot;fair and reasonable settlement while seeking a mutually acceptable solution&quot; to the border dispute. The communiqué also expressed China&#x27;s concern about agitation by Tibetan separatists in India and reiterated that anti-China political activities by expatriate Tibetans would not be tolerated. Rajiv Gandhi signed bilateral agreements on science and technology co-operation, established direct air links, and on cultural exchanges. The two sides also agreed to hold annual diplomatic consultations between foreign ministers, set up a joint committee on economic and scientific co-operation, and a joint working group on the boundary issue. The latter group was to be led by the Indian foreign secretary and the Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs.

===1990s===
Top-level dialogue continued with the December 1991 visit of PRC premier Li Peng to India and the May 1992 visit to China of Indian president R. Venkataraman. Six rounds of talks of the Indian-Chinese Joint Working Group on the Border Issue were held between December 1988 and June 1993. Progress was also made in reducing tensions on the border via mutual troop reductions, regular meetings of local military commanders, and advance notification about military exercises. In July 1992, Sharad Pawar visited Beijing, the first Indian Minister of Defence to do so. Consulates reopened in Bombay (Mumbai) and Shanghai in December 1992.

In 1993, the sixth-round of the joint working group talks was held in New Delhi but resulted in only minor developments. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Premier Li Peng signed a border agreement dealing with cross-border trade, cooperation on environmental issues (e.g. Pollution, Animal extinction, Global warming, etc.), and radio and television broadcasting. A senior-level Chinese military delegation made a goodwill visit to India in December 1993 aimed at &quot;fostering confidence-building measures between the defence forces of the two countries.&quot; The visit, however, came at a time when China was providing greater military support to Burma. The presence of Chinese radar technicians in Burma&#x27;s Coco Islands, which border India&#x27;s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, caused concern in India.

In January 1994, Beijing announced that it not only favored a negotiated solution on Kashmir, but also opposed any form of independence for the region. Talks were held in New Delhi in February aimed at confirming established &quot;confidence-building measures&quot;, discussing clarification of the &quot;line of actual control&quot;, reduction of armed forces along the line, and prior information about forthcoming military exercises. China&#x27;s hope for settlement of the boundary issue was reiterated.

In 1995, talks by the India-China Expert Group led to an agreement to set up two additional points of contact along the 4,000 km border to facilitate meetings between military personnel. The two sides were reportedly &quot;seriously engaged&quot; in defining the McMahon Line and the line of actual control vis-à-vis military exercises and prevention of air intrusion. Talks were held in Beijing in July and in New Delhi in August to improve border security, combat cross-border crimes, and on additional troop withdrawals from the border. These talks further reduced tensions.

There was little notice taken in Beijing of the April 1995 announcement of the opening of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre in New Delhi. The centre serves as the representative office of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and is the counterpart of the India-Taipei Association located in Taiwan. Both institutions share the goal of improving India-ROC relations, which have been strained since New Delhi&#x27;s recognition of Beijing in 1950.

China-Indian relations hit a low point in 1998 following India&#x27;s nuclear tests. Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes declared that &quot;“in my perception of national security, China is enemy No 1...and any person who is concerned about India&#x27;s security must agree with that fact&quot;, hinting that India developed nuclear weapons in defence against China&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. During the 1999 Kargil War, China voiced support for Pakistan, but also counseled Pakistan to withdraw its forces.

===2000s===

In a major embarrassment for China, the 17th Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, who was proclaimed by China, made a dramatic escape from Tibet to the Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue as any protest to India on the issue would mean an explicit endorsement on India&#x27;s governance of Sikkim, which the Chinese still hadn&#x27;t recognised. In 2003, China officially recognised Indian sovereignty over Sikkim as the two countries moved towards resolving their border disputes.

In 2004, the two countries proposed opening up the Nathula and Jelepla Passes in Sikkim. 2004 was a milestone in China-Indian bilateral trade, surpassing the US$10  billion mark for the first time. In April 2005, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Bangalore to push for increased China-Indian cooperation in high-tech industries. Wen stated that the 21st century will be &quot;the Asian century of the IT industry.&quot; Regarding the issue of India gaining a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, Wen Jiabao initially seemed to support the idea, but had returned to a neutral position.

In the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Summit in 2005, China was granted observer status. While other countries in the region are ready to consider China for permanent membership in the SAARC, India seemed reluctant.

In 2005, China and India signed the &#x27;Strategic and Cooperative Partnership for Peace and Prosperity&#x27;. However, there has been very little, if any, strategic convergence between the two countries.

Issues surrounding energy have risen in significance. Both countries have growing energy demand to support economic growth. Both countries signed an agreement in 2006 to envisage ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) and the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) placing joint bids for promising projects.

In 2006, China and India re-opened the Nathula pass for trading; Nathula had been closed for 44 years prior to 2006. The re-opening of border trade helps to ease the economic isolation of the region. In November 2006, China and India had a verbal spat over the claim of the north-east Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. India claimed that China was occupying 38,000 square kilometres of its territory in Kashmir, while China claimed the whole of Arunachal Pradesh as its own.

In 2007, China denied the application for visa from an Indian Administrative Service officer in Arunachal Pradesh. According to China, since Arunachal Pradesh is a territory of China, he would not need a visa to visit his own country. Later in December 2007, China reversed its policy by granting a visa to Marpe Sora, an Arunachal-born professor in computer science.
In January 2008, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited China to discuss trade, commerce, defence, military, and various other issues.
Until 2008, the British Government&#x27;s position remained the same as it had been since the Simla Accord of 1913: that China held suzerainty over Tibet but not sovereignty. Britain revised this view on 29 October 2008, when it recognized Chinese sovereignty over Tibet through its website. The Economist stated that although the British Foreign Office&#x27;s website does not use the word sovereignty, officials at the Foreign Office said &quot;it means that, as far as Britain is concerned, &#x27;Tibet is part of China. Full stop.&#x27;&quot; This change in Britain&#x27;s position affects India&#x27;s claim to its North Eastern territories, which rely on the same Simla Accord that Britain&#x27;s prior position on Tibet&#x27;s sovereignty was based upon.

In October 2009, the Asian Development Bank formally acknowledged Arunachal Pradesh as part of India and approved a loan to India for a development project there. Earlier, China had exercised pressure on the bank to cease the loan. However, India succeeded in securing the loan with the help of the United States and Japan. China expressed displeasure at the ADB.

===2010s===

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao paid an official visit to India from 15 to 17 December 2010, at the invitation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He was accompanied by 400 Chinese business leaders, who wished to sign business deals with Indian companies. During this visit, Premier Wen Jiabao said &quot;India and China are two very populous countries with ancient civilisations, friendship between the two countries has a time-honoured history, which can be dated back 2,000 years&quot;.

In April 2011, during the BRICS summit in Sanya, Hainan, China, the two countries agreed to restore defence cooperation and China had hinted that it may reverse its policy of administering stapled visas to residents of Jammu and Kashmir. This practice was later stopped, and as a result, defence ties were resumed between the two countries and joint military drills were expected.

In the March 2012 BRICS summit in New Delhi, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese President Hu Jintao told Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that &quot;it is China&#x27;s unswerving policy to develop China-Indian friendship, deepen strategic cooperation, and seek common development&quot;. Other topics were discussed, including border dispute problems and a unified BRICS central bank. In April 2012, in response to India&#x27;s test of an Agni-V missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to Beijing, the PRC called for the two countries to &quot;cherish the hard-earned momentum of co-operation&quot;.

The 2013 Depsang standoff lasted for three weeks, before being defused on 5 May 2013. Days before a trip by Indian Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid to China, Khurshid said that both countries had a shared interest in not having the border issue exacerbate or &quot;destroy&quot; long-term progress in relations. The Chinese agreed to withdraw their troops in exchange for an Indian agreement to demolish several &quot;live-in bunkers&quot; 250 km to the south, in the disputed Chumar sector. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang made his first foreign visit to India on 18 May 2013. Indian President Pranab Mukherjee&#x27;s visit to Arunachal Pradesh in late November 2013 and mentioning in his speech that the area was an &quot;integral and important part of India&quot; angered Beijing, and retaliatory statements followed.

Xi Jinping was one of the top world leaders to visit New Delhi after Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister of India in 2014. India&#x27;s insistence to raise the South China Sea in various multilateral forums subsequently did not help that beginning once again, the relationship facing suspicion from Indian administration and media alike. In September 2014, the relationship took a sting as troops of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army reportedly entered two kilometres inside the Line of Actual Control in the Chumar sector. The next month, V. K. Singh said that China and India had come to a &quot;convergence of views&quot; on the threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan.
China and India have been working together to produce films together, such as &quot;Kung Fu Yoga&quot; starring Jackie Chan. However, disruptions have risen again due to China building trade routes, the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, with Pakistan on disputed Kashmir territory. On 16 June 2017, Chinese troops with construction vehicles and road-building equipment began extending an existing road southward in Doklam, a territory which is claimed by both China as well as India&#x27;s ally Bhutan. On 18 June 2017, around 270 Indian troops, with weapons and two bulldozers, entered Doklam to stop the Chinese troops from constructing the road. Among other charges, China accused India of illegal intrusion into its territory—what it called the mutually agreed China-India boundary, and violation of its territorial sovereignty and UN Charter. India accused China of changing the status quo in violation of a 2012 understanding between the two governments regarding the tri-junction boundary points and causing &quot;security concerns&quot;, which were widely understood as its concerns with the strategic Siliguri Corridor. India media reported that on June 28, Bhutan issued a &quot;demarche,&quot; demanding that China cease road-building in Doklam and leave the area as is. The Minister of External Affairs of India at the time, Sushma Swaraj, asserted that if China unilaterally altered the status-quo of the tri-junction point between China-India and Bhutan, the nation would be posing a challenge to India&#x27;s security. China repeatedly stated that India&#x27;s withdrawal was a prerequisite for meaningful dialogue. On 21 July 2017, the Minister of External Affairs of India Sushma Swaraj said that for dialogue, both India and China must withdraw their troops. On 2 August 2017, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China published a document claiming that Indian border forces had illegally crossed the border between China and India and detailed China&#x27;s position on the matter. The document said that China notified India regarding its plan to construct a road in advance, &quot;in full reflection of China&#x27;s goodwill&quot;. The Indian Foreign Ministry replied by referring towards their earlier press release on this matter, as opposed to a point-by-point rebuttal. On 28 August 2017, China and India reached a consensus to end the border stand-off.

In May 2018, the two countries agreed to coordinate their development programmes in Afghanistan in the areas of health, education, and food security. In 2019, India reiterated that it would not join China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative, stating that it cannot accept a project that ignores concerns about its territorial integrity. On 11 October 2019, President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu, India, for a second informal meeting between India and China. Modi and Xi Jinping met 18 times between 2014 and 2019.

China offered public health and economic assistance to India in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, although India refused per the United States&#x27; request.

=== 2020s ===
On 10 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops clashed in Nathu La, Sikkim, leaving 11 soldiers injured. Following the skirmishes in Sikkim, tensions between the two countries grew in Ladakh, with a buildup of troops at multiple locations. There were 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of PLA soldiers killed on the night of 15/16 June. China reinforced troops near the Indian border with Tibet, Chinese state media reported. Bilateral agreements between India and China prevent the use of guns along the line of actual control. However, these skirmishes saw the first shots, warning shots, being fired in decades.

Following the deaths, Prime Minister Modi addressed the nation about the incident, saying that &quot;the sacrifice made by our soldiers will not go in vain&quot;, while the Indian foreign minister told the Chinese foreign minister that Chinese actions in Galwan were &quot;pre-meditated&quot;. Following the Galwan Valley clash on 15 June 2020, there were renewed calls across India to boycott Chinese goods. However, numerous Indian government officials said that border tensions would have little impact on trade.

On 29 June 2020, the Indian government banned 59 widely used Chinese mobile phone and desktop applications in response to rising tensions and escalating diplomatic dispute between the two nations. On 19 August, The Times of India reported that the ministry of external affairs of India has been told that visas for Chinese businessmen, academics, industry experts, and advocacy groups will need prior security clearance, and the measures are similar to those that have long been employed with Pakistan. On 19 September, India police arrested a freelance journalist for passing sensitive information to Chinese intelligence.

On 27 October 2020, the United States and India signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement, enabling greater information-sharing and further defense cooperation, to counter China&#x27;s growing military power in the region.

After the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of India responded, &quot;Like many other countries, India, too, is concerned at recent developments. We urge the exercise of restraint, avoidance of unilateral actions to change status quo, de-escalation of tensions, and efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region.&quot; India stopped reiterating the so-called &quot;One China&quot; policy as early as 2010.

In September 2022, India and China pulled back soldiers from a friction point along the line of actual control. However, according to India&#x27;s Ministry for External Affairs, the situation on the Line of Actual Control is &quot;still not normal&quot;. &quot;The Diplomat&quot; has reported that normalcy around the border between the countries seems unlikely and may not develop further.
On October 6th 2022, India abstained on a draft resolution in the UNHRC on &quot;holding a debate on the situation of human rights in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China&quot; 

In June 2023, China placed a technical hold on a proposal moved by the U.S. and co-designated by India to sanction accused Pakistani terrorist Sajid Mir under the 12/67 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council. Mir had previously orchestrated bombings in Mumbai, killing some 175 people. India heavily criticized the Chinese decision.

On 25 August 2023 during the 15th BRICS summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, Modi and Xi spoke on the summit&#x27;s sidelines where they agreed to deescalate tensions at the border. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said both leaders &quot;had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on current China-India relations” and Xi stated that &quot;improving China-India relations serves the common interests of the two countries and peoples”, while the Ministry of External Affairs of India stated that during the meeting Modi &quot;underlined that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas, and observing and respecting the LAC are essential for the normalization of the India-China relationship.&quot; The meeting was seen as a step toward mending the bilateral relations between the two countries. 

In October 2024, India announced that it had reached an agreement over patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border area, which would lead to disengagement and resolution of the long-running conflict that began in 2020.

In January 2025, China and India agreed to resume direct flights between the two countries after nearly 5 years.

== Triangular relations ==
The United States and Russia (previously Soviet Union) have been a consistent part of developments in Chinese and Indian relations.

As a major power, Japan has also been part of China–India relations, with initiatives such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Pakistan and China share warm relations that drive Chinese infrastructure projects in the disputed territory of northern Kashmir. The Middle East, Latin America, and Africa are places where both India and China engage and compete. The Middle East is important to both countries in terms of their energy security. In Africa, China and India seem most engaged across a wide variety of issues, from development to peacekeeping. In South Asia and South-East Asia, a power balance struggle between China and India is seen in triangular relations.

=== Nepal ===
Nepal&#x27;s geostrategic situation during periods of heightened tensions between China and India, such as during the 1962 war, resulted in varying shades of cautionary neutrality when making statements. Nepal&#x27;s Permanent Representative stated, &quot;we do not want to pass judgement on the merits of Sino-Indian border dispute. As a country friendly to both...&quot;. Tulsi Giri, then the Nepalese foreign minister, stated, &quot;Nepal&#x27;s relations with India will remain close [...] Yet, Nepal has a 600-mile boundary with China, China has now emerged as a great power. Friendly relations with our northern neighbour (China) should be the natural aim of the country&#x27;s foreign policy.&quot; During the time Tibet was independent, Nepal played the role as an important buffer state and was central to influence between the regions.

The China-Nepal-India Economic Corridor (CNIEC) was proposed by China in April 2018. It is an extension of the agreed upon China-Nepal Trans-Himalayan Multi-dimensional Connectivity Network into India. While China and Nepal have shown favourable reactions towards CNIEC, India is &quot;indifferent&quot;. This indifference is postulated to stem from CNIEC being a part of BRI, China&#x27;s growing influence over Nepal, and an end to &quot;India&#x27;s monopoly over Nepal&#x27;s transit points and Nepal&#x27;s attempt to end its dependency on India&quot;.

=== United States ===
On 11 November 1950, Sri Aurobindo wrote in &quot;Mother India,&quot;

On 28 March 1963, Sudhir Ghosh recorded the President of the United States John F Kennedy&#x27;s reaction on reading Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s words, &quot;One great Indian, Nehru, showed you the path of non-alignment between China and America, and another great Indian Aurobindo, showed you another way of survival. The choice is up to the people of India.&quot; Earlier in the meeting, Ghosh recorded Kennedy&#x27;s reaction to a letter from Nehru, &quot;He indignantly said that only a few months earlier when Mr Nehru was overwhelmed by the power of Communist China, he made desperate appeal to him for air protection, and non-alignment or no non-alignment, the President had to respond. He added sarcastically that Mr Nehru&#x27;s conversion lasted only a few days&quot;.

Unlike the left-wing diplomatic leanings of the Indian Congress Party, the BJP administration has strengthened its strategic partnership with the United States. China faces combined challenges to its influence with its neighbors, and because it sees a growing threat from India and the United States&#x27; cooperation, it has exaggerated the discord between the two countries to divide and conquer its rivals.

India participated in the restart of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and has strengthened the military, diplomatic, and economic cooperation with the United States, Japan, and Australia. More recently, after the deadly Chinese-initiated clash at Galwan Valley in June 2020, preceded by the 2017 Doklam standoff, the U.S.-based think tank, the Center for Foreign Relations, explained that there was a significant ramp-up in QUAD activity. The group cites how, since 2020, the group has looked beyond regional cooperation and have focused on checking Chinese regional behavior, with the four navies performing their first joint exercise in over a decade in November 2020. This was specifically initiated by India in response to the border skirmishes.

=== Indo-Pacific ===

Pakistan, and more importantly, Myanmar, other than India itself, are potential land routes into the Indian Ocean. Pan Qi, Vice Minister for Communications, wrote in 1985 that China would need to find an outlet for its landlocked provinces. At the time, he suggested routes to the Indian Ocean through Myanmar.

In the same vein of invigorating relationships with geopolitical allies, India has also strengthened their Look East Policy, transforming it into the Act East Policy under the Modi administration. The rebranded Act East Policy has an increased focus on infrastructure projects, such as the Agartala-Akhaura Rail Project and the Asian Trilateral Highway. Such geopolitical connectivity measures improved India&#x27;s alliances with the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam to check Chinese dominance. These soft power measures also enhance Indian border security.

=== Western Indian Ocean ===
The Western Indian Ocean has been characterised as an emerging &quot;geopolitical theatre&quot; marked by interstate conflict between India, China and the US. The regions holds key geostrategic importance to all three states. Roughly 40 percent of world trade passes through the region as well as two thirds of global oil and gas supplies. It is a main gateway for global energy supply and two of the world&#x27;s most important maritime chokepoints, the Bab-el Mandeb and Hormuz strait, are both located in the Western Indian Ocean region. India and China are both dependent on access and free passage in the Western Indian Ocean as it is crucial to secure the increasing energy demand by the two growing economies/ The US is also dependent on the free passage of oil from the Middle East to the trans-Atlantic world through the region.

India and China are both motivated by defensive interests in securing their supplies of energy and trade in the region. Beyond this both states are attempting to increase their relative power positions, economically as well as militarily and naval. This is commonly understood through the terms String of Pearls regarding China and India&#x27;s Act East Policy. This could potentially align the two countries against the US, but this does not seem to be the case. India and China continue to strive for similar power positions and power rivalry between the two states continue.

Beijing is refusing to see India as a regional power and from an Indian perspective the Indian Ocean is largely seen as “India’s Ocean”. Any Chinese encroachment on India&#x27;s sphere of interest is seen as a potential threat. To counter increased Chinese naval and economic presence India has joined the Quad-alliance between the US, Japan and Australia and is carrying out naval missions with the US, China&#x27;s core strategic rival. As such Sino-Indian relations in the Western Indian Ocean can be understood in terms of a triangular relationship of continuous counterbalancing between the three states.

Both India and China have interests in containing the influence of the other, yet none of them has the capacity to fully do this. India&#x27;s aspirations to become a great regional power are constrained for several reasons. New Delhi&#x27;s focus has traditionally been directed towards the continent and its naval development is lagging behind both China and the US. Scholars also point towards the lack of a coherent maritime strategy despite increased political attention to the issue, for example through its Act East policy. Political protectionist tendencies have allowed China to increase its relative economic influence overtaking India&#x27;s position as main trading partner in various countries in the region. In 2005 China surpassed India and became Bangladesh&#x27;s main trading partner. Despite these constraints China does not have the capacity to fully contain India. India continues to hold a special position in the region due to its dominating geographical position, history and interstate relations. Furthermore, it is in US interests to counterbalance China&#x27;s increased naval strength through cooperation with India.

As such geopolitical rivalry and strategic counterbalancing remains unsettled in the Western Indian Ocean and intensified rivalry between India and China seems to be the most likely trajectory some time to come. This has substantial security implications as the increased militarisation decreases trust between the states and thus complicates cooperation over persisting security problems such as piracy. A potential risk of militarisation at sea is that offence-defence tactics are often difficult to distinguish. Even if India and China followed solely defensive strategies, as it has been claimed, it might be perceived as offensive tactics within the maritime domain. Furthermore, both states are deploying military and naval means beyond what is commonly seen as necessary to defend global shipping routes. This includes nuclear-powered submarines send by China to fight piracy in the region.

== Military relations==
=== Border clashes ===
Since the 1950s, during the term of India&#x27;s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, India and China have repeatedly encountered border disputes at the Line of Actual Control, delineating the border between the two nations. The first Sino-India border war broke out in 1962 at the Aksai Chin region, escalating into a month-long military conflict. Initiating the conflict, China took advantage of global concern about the ongoing Cuban missile crisis to time their regional invasion in hopes of building a military road in India&#x27;s Ladakh region.

During the Narendra Modi administration, bloody clashes erupted again on the Sino-Indian border. The strategic alliance between China and Pakistan, and the vigorous arming of the Pakistani forces, make India face the threat of a two-front war. Indian officials said the huge differences between the two sides on the border issue &quot;eroded the entire basis&quot; of their relationship.

===Military exercises===

China and India conduct a joint military exercise called &#x27;Exercise Hand–in–Hand&#x27;. The exercise began in 2007, with the second edition taking place in 2008. The third, fifth, and seventh editions of Hand-in-Hand were conducted in China in 2013, 2015, and 2018, respectively, while the fourth edition and sixth editions were held in India in 2014 and 2016. The eighth edition was held in India in 2019. While bilateral military exercises between India and China have ceased over the past few years, India is still accepting invitations from Russia for multilateral armed forces exercises that also happen to host Chinese soldiers.

== Water sharing and hydro–politics ==

A total of seven rivers that start in Tibet flow through India — Indus, Satlej, Karnali (Ghaghara), Subansiri, Brahmaputra, and Lohit (and its tributary Dulai).

Brahma Chellaney has written that &quot;India&#x27;s formal recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet constitutes the single biggest security blunder with lasting consequences for Indian territorial and river-water interests&quot;.

India has concern with China&#x27;s water–diversion, dam–building, and inter–river plans. More so, in a conflict, India fears that China can use the rivers as leverage. China has already constructed ten dams on the Bhramaputra and its tributaries, such as the Zangmu Dam, and there has been talk of China building a mega–dam at the &quot;great bend&quot; called the Motuo Dam. India&#x27;s concerns also stem from the fact that China does not cooperate with regard to timely sharing of information related to projects which would impact water sharing, nor does China allow Indian experts to visit dam sites. There are a number of memoranda of understanding on hydrological data sharing between the two countries with regard to the Brahmaputra, including emergency management.

An alternate view is also presented in relation to &quot;misinformation spread by some (Indian) newspapers&quot; and the waters of Brahmaputra — &quot;80 percent of the waters of the Brahmaputra emanate from the north side of the Himalayas in China and that that country cannot be the sole arbiter of its international waters. This is not right. Eighty percent of the waters of the mighty Brahmaputra are picked up after it enters India&quot; and that Chinese activities have helped India by reducing annual flood intensity in the north-east.

==Economic relations==
India-China economic relations have been institutionalized through the Joint Economic Group and Business Council, as well as more focused efforts such as the &quot;Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation&quot;.

China and India have developed their own complementary skills following a period in which they had cut themselves off from each other. By 2007, while China excelled at cost-effective manufacturing, India was skilled in cost effective designing and development. In 2007, Tarun Khanna wrote in Harvard Business Review that &quot;The simplest, and most powerful, way of combining China and India is to focus on hardware in China and on software in India.&quot; In the 2009 book &quot;Getting China and India Right&quot;, the authors suggest a China plus India strategy so as to strategically benefit from both India&#x27;s and China&#x27;s scale, complementary strengths, and reducing the risk of being unilaterally present.

There are cases when Indian companies have gone to China and done well, such as Mahindra and Mahindra, while Chinese companies such as Huawei have done well in India. Huawei set up its Indian unit in 1999 and by 2007, had 1500 engineers. Huawei&#x27;s Bangalore unit, already one of Huawei&#x27;s most important research and development centres, was Capability Maturity Model Level 5 certified in 2003.

In the oil sector, there is competition and engagement — China&#x27;s Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corporation and India&#x27;s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation fight over oil assets in some regions, while winning bids as joint ventures in others such as Syria, Colombia, Angola, and Venezuela.

Since the deterioration of relations between the two countries in the 2010s, India has banned a large number of Chinese technology companies and software, including Huawei, TikTok, WeChat, etc., from entering the Indian market. In order to reduce Western countries&#x27; previous dependence on Chinese products, India plays an integral role in boosting supply chain resilience through friendshoring.

On 18 January 2024, at the World Economic Forum 2024 in Davos, Switzerland, top Indian industrial policy bureaucrat Rajesh Kumar Singh told &quot;Reuters&quot; that due to easing of border tensions between India and China in 2023, India could reduce its heightened scrutiny of Chinese investments in India although timeframe for it was not given.

===Bilateral trade===
China is India&#x27;s 2nd largest trading partner. In June 2012, China asserted that &quot;Sino-Indian ties&quot; could be the most &quot;important bilateral partnership of the century&quot;, seemingly substantiated by current Prime Minister Narenda Modi&#x27;s historic visit to China in May 2015. At that pivotal visit, Wen Jiabao, the Premier of China, and Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of India set a goal to increase Indo-Chinese bilateral trade to US$100 billion by 2015. At the India-China Business Forum in Shanghai, Modi claimed that China and India would pool together their manufacturing capabilities, citing initiative examples, such as building “50 million houses by 2022”, &quot;develop[ing] smart cities and mega industrial corridors”, and refining FDI policy and modernizing railway systems together.

Following that conference, bilateral trade between China and India touched US$89.6 billion in 2017–18, with the trade deficit widening to US$62.9 billion in China&#x27;s favor. In 2017, the volume of bilateral trade between India &amp; China stood at US$84.5 billion. This figure excludes bilateral trade between India and Hong Kong, which stands at another US$34 billion. Chinese imports from India amounted to $16.4 billion, or 0.8% of its overall imports, and 4.2% of India&#x27;s overall exports in 2014. Major commodities exported from India to China were: cotton; gems, precious metals, coins; copper; ores, slag, ash; organic chemicals; salt, sulphur, stone, cement; machines, engines, and pumps. Chinese exports to India amounted to $58.4 billion or 2.3% of its overall exports, which made up approximately 12.6% of India&#x27;s overall imports in 2014. Major commodities exported from China to India were: electronic equipment; machines, engines, pumps; organic chemicals; fertilizers; iron and steel; plastics; iron or steel products; gems, precious metals, coins; ships, boats; medical, and technical equipment.

In 2018, a Standing Committee on Commerce chaired by Naresh Gujral submitted a report on the &#x27;Impact of Chinese Goods on Indian Industry.&#x27; The report pointed out insufficient implementation of existing anti-dumping laws, reliance on Chinese raw materials in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, reliance on Chinese imports in India&#x27;s National Solar Mission, Goods and Services Tax on certain products resulting in increased imports from China, and Indian smart city administrations preferring Chinese bicycles over Indian ones. 
India imported $65.3 billion worth of goods from China in the fiscal year ended March 2020, and exported $16.6 billion, according to the commerce ministry.

In 2020, in a departure from the previous pledges of collaboration, Modi instituted bans on Chinese products, including both intangible apps (TikTok) and tangible goods (toys and furniture). Furthermore, the Modi administration created the Phased Manufacturing Program to encourage India-based cellphone assembly and manufacturing. Under guidance from this legislation and the accompanying task force to reduce import dependence, India raised import duties on electronic items produced in China, as well as a laundry list of ancillary goods.

According to a 2021 survey published in &quot;ThePrint&quot;, 43% of Indians did not buy ‘Made in China’ products since the Galwan clash the previous year. Modi also took notice of Swadeshi Jagran Manch&#x27;s (SJM) campaigns, launching or reviving 220 out of 370 anti-dumping suits against Chinese items ranging from steels, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals.

Due to the international sanctions against Russia following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Indian oil refiners started using Chinese yuan for payments of Russian oil imports as an alternative to the US dollar. The Indian government also does not welcome the use of yuan for payments by its companies.

== Cultural relations ==

=== Cinema ===
Aamir Khan has had significant success in China, with his movies yielding some of the highest foreign revenues of any from India.

=== Cuisine ===
== Public opinion ==

According to a 2014 BBC World Service Poll, 23% of Indians viewed China positively, with 47% expressing a negative view, whereas 27% of Chinese people viewed India positively, with 35% expressing a negative view. A 2014 survey conducted by Pew Research Center had 39% of Indian respondents holding an unfavourable view of China compared to 31% holding a favourable view; 72% of the respondents were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict.

An Observer Research Foundation survey released in August 2021 of Indian youth found that 77% of respondents distrusted China, which was higher than any other country, including Pakistan. 86% also supported the government&#x27;s decision to ban Chinese mobile apps. An August 2023 survey by Pew Research Center found that 67% of Indian respondents had an unfavorable view of China.

A 2008 poll from the Pew Research Center found that in China, views about India were mixed – 25% said India was a partner, while 24% said it was an enemy. In 2011, Vikas Bajaj of The New York Times found Chinese media rarely reported about India and general populace lacks awareness and expertise on Indian matters. A 2023 Tsinghua University survey found that 8% of Chinese respondents had a favorable view of India, 50.6% had an unfavorable view, and 41.5% had a neutral view.

<doc id="1193783" wikidata="Q7270063" url="?curid=1193783" title="Queen's Park, Glasgow">
<text>Queen&#x27;s Park (, ) is a park situated on the south side of the city of Glasgow, Scotland, between Strathbungo, Shawlands, Battlefield, Mount Florida, and Crosshill. The park lies about south of the city centre, and gives its name to a nearby railway station and several other local businesses and institutions, including the football team Queen&#x27;s Park FC.

== History ==

The lands of the park were part of the lands of Langside, belonging to the Maxwells of Pollok. During the 17th Century, the western part was sold to form Camphill Farm. This was sold again in 1799 to Glasgow manufacturer Robert Thomson who built , which still stands at the edge of the park grounds. His son purchased the adjacent Pathhead Farm in 1834, and the merged land was sold by grandson Neale Thomson to Glasgow Corporation in 1857 for the purpose of developing Glasgow&#x27;s third park.

The park was developed in the late 19th century in response to the increasing population density of Glasgow in general, and the South Side in particular, with the growth of tenement housing supplying the increased demand for middle-class homes. Victorian Glasgow took the provision of open spaces extremely seriously, with the result that parks such as Queen&#x27;s Park sprang up across the city. It is surrounded by several residential city districts, mostly consisting primarily of tenements, namely Battlefield, Crosshill, Crossmyloof, Govanhill, Langside, Shawlands and Strathbungo. The buildings of the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary hospital (both the 19th and 21st century facilities) are also nearby.
The park was designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, also responsible for noted public parks in London, Liverpool, Birkenhead and the grounds of the Spa Buildings at Scarborough. The original plans for the park included a winter garden and an artificial loch, but these were considered too extravagant and were removed in amended plans developed by the city architect, John Carrick. The park was dedicated to the memory of Mary, Queen of Scots - Mary lost the Battle of Langside near the park, and the park given its present name in place of the original &#x27;South Side Park&#x27;.

In 2008 local resident Moira Jones was abducted outside her home and killed in the park, and this crime and the hunt for the killer were given considerable media coverage In 2014, several thousand women marched through the park and surrounding streets at night to highlight and protest against several sexual assaults which had occurred in the area over the preceding months during hours of darkness. However, further rare but serious incidents of a similar nature occurred following that event.

== Current usage ==
Today the park is used by many thousands of people annually, and remains a focal point for the people of the South Side of Glasgow and beyond. The park holds the regular farmers markets and a wide range of family events, many of these in the redeveloped bandstand which is now known as Queen&#x27;s Park Arena. The park also contains a wide range of leisure and sports areas and facilities. Since 2019, &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Parkrun&#x27;, a weekly free 5 km event, has taken place in the park every Saturday morning at 9.30am.

There are three lawn bowls clubs, a tennis centre, a five-a-side football facility and a pitch and putt course within the park, as well as (a former mansion built 1806, now private apartments), and , a former bank office which was originally in Glasgow city centre before being moved to its current location in 1889; it is now a community centre. Both buildings are Category A listed.

The tennis courts are managed by Queens Park Community Tennis Club and Glasgow City Council who funded the refurbished tennis courts in 2015.
The park is popular in snowy weather, when the public make use of the park&#x27;s steep hills for sledging.

From various points of the park, it is possible to view the full expanse of Glasgow in a given direction. The most comprehensive viewpoint is marked by a flagpole, and affords views of tens of miles to the north, east and south. In good visibility this view encompasses the Campsie Fells. Although the current viewfinder indicates that Ben Lomond is visible, this is incorrect. What is actually visible are the twin summits of Stob Binnein and Ben More by Crianlarich. Ben Lomond is further west, and would be completely obscured behind the Kilpatrick Hills, if they themselves were not hidden behind nearby trees.

==Archaeology==
An earthwork runs over the top of the hill in the park enclosing an area approximately . Excavations in 1951 revealed 14th century pottery. By comparison with similar archaeological sites in the area, it is suggested by Eric J Talbot, then of Glasgow University, that this was a Norman ringwork earth and timber castle.

<text>John Sheppard (sometimes spelled Shepherd or Shepheard) (22 September 1817 – 17 December 1884) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Royal Navy career==
Sheppard was 37 years old, and a boatswain&#x27;s mate in the Royal Navy, serving with the Naval Brigade during the Crimean War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 15 July 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimean Peninsula, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Sheppard went into the harbour at night, in a punt, which he had especially constructed for the purpose, with an explosive device with which he intended to blow up one of the Russian warships. He managed to get past the enemy&#x27;s steamboats at the entrance of Careening Bay, but was prevented from getting further by a long string of boats carrying enemy troops. He made a second attempt on 16 August but although both these actions were unsuccessful, they were boldly conceived and carried out in the face of great danger.

Sheppard was only the fourth person to be awarded the Victoria Cross, and the first from Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire. He later achieved the rank of boatswain first class. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, England.

<text>The Cairo Electric Railways &amp; Heliopolis Oases Company () was formed in Cairo, Egypt in 1906 to develop a 25 square kilometer plot of land into the Heliopolis suburb. It was nationalised in 1960, and remained a state-owned enterprise until it was listed on the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange (now the Egyptian Exchange, or EGX) in 1995 and renamed the Heliopolis Company for Housing and Development ().

== History ==
On May 20, 1905, the Egyptian government signed a concession to develop a large desert plot of 25 square kilometres north-east of Cairo, with Belgian industrialist Édouard Empain and Boghos Nubar Pasha, son of the former Egyptian Prime Minister Nubar Pasha.

The Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oases Company itself was established by the two entrepreneurs and 22 other investors and companies on February 14, 1906 as a property development company to build the Heliopolis Oasis near where the ancient city of Heliopolis once stood.

The new suburb was planned with rail and tramway links to the centre of Cairo, and consisted of plots for villas, Heliopolis style apartment blocks, workers&#x27; housing, the Heliopolis Palace Hotel (converted later into a presidential palace), restaurants, shops, churches, mosques, a synagogue, and hospitals. 

In 1955, the company was instructed by the government according to Law 123/1955, to prepare 1,500 400m2 plots of land in five new neighbourhoods on its desert concession to be sold at LE1.45 per square meter primarily to government employees or members of housing cooperatives approved by the Cairo municipality. 

The post-independence socialist government of Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the company in 1961, turning it into the public Masr al-Gadida Suburb Organisation (Arabic:مؤسسة ضاحية مصر الجديدة) and affiliated to the Ministry of Municipal and Village Affairs, taking on the real estate development business. By 1964 the company was renamed as the Heliopolis Company for Housing and Development (). 

As part of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank&#x27;s Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Programme, or ERSAP, the company was part of a privatisation programme and was listed in 1996 on the Egyptian Exchange and has the Reuters code of HELI.CA. As of 2021, the government of Egypt was still the majority shareholder, with its Holding Company for Construction and Development owning 72% of the company, while the second-largest shareholder by far was the government of Norway, whose Norges Bank owned 1.19%. 

==Heliopolis Palace Hotel ==
=== History ===
On September 23, 1905, the world celebrated the official date of this new hotel. Conceived by Belgian architect Ernest Jaspar, his birth boasted 400 shows including 55 private shows. 
Its banquet halls were amongst the biggest anywhere. The utilities were the state of the art technology of the time. All had been constructed and put together by the contracting firms Leon Rolin &amp; Co. and Padova, Dentamaro &amp; Ferro, the biggest two civil contractors in Egypt. Siemens-Schuckert of Berlin fitted the hotel&#x27;s web of electric cables and installations.

=== Design ===
As though intentional, its severe, almost forbidding exterior contrasted sharply with the extravagance of the interior. A 1912 visitor recounts: &quot;Beyond the reception offices are two lavishly decorated rooms, in the Louis XIV and Louis XV styles respectively and then comes the central hall, which is a dream of beauty and symmetry. Here the architecture, which is responsible for so many wonderful effects in Heliopolis, reaches its artistic zenith. Damascus-made Oriental lamps hung from every corner and cranny hang.&quot; 
King Albert I (King of Belgium), who stayed in the hotel with his wife Queen Elisabeth for a month, said &quot;C&#x27;est une merveille!&quot; upon entering the main hall. 
The main hall, which was almost 589 meters2, had a 55-meter-wide dome, designed by Alexander Marcel of the French Institute and decorated by Georges Claude, was carpeted with the finest oriental rugs and fitted with large floor-to-ceiling mirrors, draperies and a large marble fireplace. Twenty-two Italian marble columns connected the parquet to the ceiling. To one side of the hall there was the dining room, which seated 150 guests, and to the other was the billiard hall with two full-sized Thurston tables, as well as a priceless French one. The hotel&#x27;s mahogany furniture were supplied by Maple&#x27;s Furniture (London). 
The hotel&#x27;s area was so large, that a railway system was installed, running through the hotel; passing by offices, kitchens, refrigerators, storerooms and the staff housing.

=== World Wars and after ===
During World War I and II, the hotel was transformed into a military hospital for British soldiers. 
After World War II, air travel reduced the average tourist stay to a few days. As tourism became a mega-industry, massive hotels emerged in Egypt with interiors calculated on the basis of return per square meter. Unable to compete, the hotel became less popular.

=== Becoming a Presidential palace ===
In the 1980s, which marks the beginning of the Mubarak regime, the Heliopolis Palace Hotel was declared the headquarters of the new presidential administration, after becoming the location of various government departments for over 10 years.

== Heliopark plot ==
In October 2003, a presidential decree allocated the Heliopolis Company for Housing and Development a plot of land in the satellite city of New Cairo, as a compensation for the land that was taken to build the Cairo International Airport. In 2021, and agreement was made for its development as the Heliopark project.

<doc id="1193793" wikidata="Q1219658" url="?curid=1193793" title="Lucius Neratius Marcellus">
<text>Lucius Neratius Marcellus (&quot;fl&quot;. 1st century – 2nd century AD) was an imperial Roman military officer and senator who held a number of posts in the Emperor&#x27;s service. Marcellus was elected consul twice, first under Domitian in 95AD and again under Hadrian in 129. His life provides several examples of how patronage operated in early Imperial Rome.

He was a consul in 95AD, succeeding the Emperor Domitian, and again in 129. He served as a military tribune with the Legio XII Fulminata. He is the first person attested to have held the position of recorder of the minutes of the Senate. He was Governor of Britannia from 101 to 104. This was a period when the under-garrisoned province was under pressure from restless tribes. Marcellus supervised a stabilization of the situation which included a withdrawal from the future site of Antonine Wall to what was later to become the line of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

== Early life ==
The origins of the gens Neratia lie in the Italian town of Saepinum, located in Samnium. Olli Salomies, in his study of Imperial Roman nomenclature, has established that while Marcellus was the brother of the jurist Lucius Neratius Priscus, and thus the natural child of Lucius Neratius Priscus, he had been adopted by his uncle Marcus Hirrius Fronto Neratius Pansa, consul in 73 or 74, who was childless.

It has been argued that Marcellus was married twice. One wife is attested for Marcellus on inscriptions recovered from Saepinum she erected in his honor, Domitia Vettilla, the daughter of Lucius Domitius Apollinaris, suffect consul in AD 97. However, it has been argued that Marcellus had married Corellia Hispulla, based on the existence of a son Lucius Corellius Neratius Pansa, consul of AD 122; Hispulla was the daughter of Pliny the Younger’s elderly friend Quintus Corellius Rufus, suffect consul in AD 78. Ronald Syme notes that Marcellus &quot;need not have ... only one wife&quot;, and argues he was married first to Hispulla, then to Vettilla.

== Career until governor of Britain ==
An inscription recovered from Saepinum provides details of Marcellus&#x27; career. In his teens he was one of the &quot;tresviri monetalis&quot;, the most prestigious of the four boards that comprise the &quot;vigintiviri&quot;. Assignment to this board was usually the prerogative of patricians or favored individuals. An inscription found in Xanthos is understood by experts to indicate that he accompanied his adoptive father to the Roman province of Lycia while the older man governed it as &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;, or imperial governor. On returning to Rome both were adlected (promoted) into the patrician class, most likely during the Roman census of 73–74. This promotion in status offered many opportunities, including being excused from holding some of the republican magistracies otherwise required to become consul.

Marcellus was then given the position of &quot;curator acta senatorum&quot;, or recorder of the minutes of the Senate. He is the first person attested to have held this position. At the age of 25 he held the republican magistracy of quaestor, being selected as one of the pair allocated to attend to the Emperor. The duties of these quaestors included reading the Emperor&#x27;s speeches to the Senate. This was followed by his admission to the &quot;collegia&quot; of the &quot;Salius Palatinus&quot;, a priestly order tracing its roots back to the Roman Kingdom. Marcellus&#x27; service to the Emperor resumed with a commission as a &quot;tribunus laticlavius&quot; with the Legio XII Fulminata which was part of an expeditionary force led by his adoptive father Neratius Pansa in Cappadocia. This expedition is thought to have taken place in 75 and 76.

Due to his promotion to the patrician class, Marcellus was excused from holding any commands or offices between the praetorship and his appointment as suffect consul in AD 95, replacing the emperor Domitian on the Ides of January. Ronald Syme describes being the suffect to replace the emperor as a &quot;high distinction, and close to being consul ordinarius&quot;. Marcellus served as &quot;curator aquarum urbis&quot; (supervisor of the city&#x27;s aqueducts) between his consulship and his appointment as the &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; of Roman Britain. He certainly held the office before 103, when his governorship is attested by a military diploma.

== Britain and after ==

Marcellus was Governor of Britannia from 101 to 104. At about this time the Roman army was hard pressed to hold the territory Agricola had conquered a generation before. Legio II Adiutrix had been withdrawn to the Danube in AD 92 with three cohorts of Batavian auxiliaries. Emperor Trajan, needing reinforcements for his First Dacian War, had called for vexillations (detachments) from the army in Britain. The natives took advantage of the understrength garrison: excavations at Newstead and elsewhere show signs of destruction by fire. Although the Romans often burnt what was not worth salvaging when they evacuated a fort, excavations also revealed human remains and immense quantities of equipment, including damaged armour, at Newstead. This has been taken as clear evidence of hostile action. The frontier was withdrawn from the Antonine Wall to the line of the Stanegate, the future Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Marcellus certainly managed at least a portion of this major reorganization.

Neratius Marcellus was a friend of Pliny the Younger. Although none of Pliny&#x27;s letters to Marcellus have survived, one of his extant letters does mention him. Pliny had requested that Marcellus make Suetonius a tribune in Britain. When he succeeded in obtaining this favor for Suetonius, the latter eventually declined the post, which Pliny then transferred to a relative of Suetonius&#x27; in his place. This story indicates that Marcellus was able to make military appointments easily through the network of patronage, apparently without consulting the army.

Another illustration of Marcellus&#x27; role in the network of patronage of his time is a draft of a letter recovered from the Roman fort at Vindolanda. The commander of the Ninth Cohort of Batavians stationed there, Flavius Cerialis, writes to his friend Crispinus about meeting with governor Marcellus. The text is damaged at this point, and there have been several theories proposed by modern historians as to the purpose of this communication. Anthony Birley suggested Cerialis was asking Crispinus to intercede on his behalf for a promotion or transfer; M. P. Speidel and R. Seider suggest this was an example of &quot;litterae commendaticiae&quot;, or a letter introducing himself to Crispinus; in their edition of the letter, Alan K. Bowman and J. David Thomas offer a more prosaic interpretation: &quot;The writer is asking Crispinus to... make his military service pleasant by putting him on good terms with as many influential people as possible.&quot;

The next record of Neratius Marcellus comes decades after he returned from Britain, when he was elected &quot;consul ordinarius&quot; in AD 129, serving alongside Publius Juventius Celsus Titus Aufidius Hoenius Severianus. Observing that the emperor Hadrian relied on his brother for advice, Birley believes that Marcellus was &quot;on familiar terms&quot; with Hadrian, which may be the reason for the signal honour of a second consulship. However, Birley then notes that &quot;it may be that he came to a sad end soon afterwards, for among Hadrian&#x27;s close friends... the author of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; lists a Marcellus, forced to suicide by the emperor.&quot;

<text>Mondo Thingo was an Australian pop culture television show which aired for 37 episodes on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 2004.

The show was presented by Amanda Keller, with regular appearances by Steve Cannane and Robbie Buck (from the ABC&#x27;s Triple J radio station). The series irreverently covered elements of popular culture, including movies, music, internet, fashion and marketing – or in Keller&#x27;s words, &quot;the soft underbelly of pop culture&quot;.

The program was generally well received by viewers, but critical opinion was somewhat polarised: a &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; team compiling the newspaper&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Couch Potato&quot; Awards was divided between those who found the program annoying, and those who found it well-written and entertaining. Some critics also decried that several of the ABC&#x27;s arts programs were axed to make way for broader, more populist material such as &quot;Mondo Thingo&quot;.

<text>Amanda Rose Keller (born 25 February 1962) is an Australian television and radio presenter, comedian, writer, actress, journalist and media personality, best known as the hostess of the popular Australian lifestyle program &quot;The Living Room&quot;. Keller also co-hosts Jonesy &amp; Amanda with Brendan Jones on Gold 101.7 and &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with Grant Denyer on Network 10.

==Education==

Keller attended Carlingford High School and Mitchell College of Advanced Education (now Charles Sturt University), where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications in 1982. At university, she was a contemporary of Andrew Denton among others, and was a student of Peter Temple. She was a broadcaster with on-campus community radio station 2MCE-FM.

==Career==
Keller’s first professional media job was in 1983 as a researcher for the popular children&#x27;s television show, &quot;Simon Townsend&#x27;s Wonder World!&quot;. She was later a researcher and producer for &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; when Gordon Elliott and Kerri-Anne Kennerley were hosts. By 1985, she was a researcher and producer for Ray Martin&#x27;s &quot;Midday&quot; show, where she first began to appear regularly on camera.

In 1987, she left &quot;Midday&quot; to appear in the pilot for Richard Neville&#x27;s counter-culture programme &quot;Extra Dimensions&quot;, which was produced by the same team that made &quot;Beyond 2000&quot;. &quot;Extra Dimensions&quot; folded after the first season. Keller&#x27;s luck changed when she was signed to &quot;Beyond 2000&quot;, the internationally popular science programme, where she won numerous media awards including the United Nations Association of Australia&#x27;s Media Peace Award in 1989, and the Michael Daley Award for Science Journalism.

In 1994, she joined Andrew Denton as a regular guest on his show &quot;Denton&quot;, where she combined her scientific knowledge with her love of popular culture and kitsch—subsequently publishing a book, &quot;Amanda&#x27;s Handy Home Hints&quot;. When the series finished in 1995, she joined Denton at Sydney radio station Triple M where they co-presented the breakfast show. At the same time, she hosted her own contemporary culture show on cable television called &quot;The Hub&quot;.

She hosted her own pop culture-centric program &quot;Mondo Thingo&quot; in 2004. In 2006, Keller appeared in Series Five of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; where she progressed to the fifth round before being eliminated.

In 2008, she starred in the SBS TV series &quot;Swift and Shift Couriers&quot; as Amanda Doyle, the Regional Manager, and returned to this role for season two in 2011. Also, in 2011, she had a small role in another sitcom, &quot;Housos&quot;, also on SBS TV.

In 2009 for the duration of the show Keller was the Baby Boomers team leader on Network Ten&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Your Generation&quot;. The show began airing in 2009 and finished its fourth season in 2012.

In 2017 she became one of the highest paid women in Australian radio. Also in that same year, she made a cameo appearance as a news reporter in episode 7547 of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; alongside Brendan Jones and Ita Buttrose.

She was inducted into the Australian Commercial Radio Hall of Fame in 2017.

In 2019, Keller started co-hosting &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with Grant Denyer.

She has also made appearances on shows such as &quot;Good News Week&quot;, &quot;Rove Live&quot;, &quot;The Glass House&quot;, &quot;20 to 1&quot;, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, &quot;All Star Family Feud&quot;, &quot;The Project&quot;, &quot;Studio 10&quot;, &quot;Show Me the Movie!&quot;, &quot;Have You Been Paying Attention?&quot; and &quot;Hughesy, We Have a Problem&quot;.

On 18 July 2024, Keller was named for ABC factual series &quot;The Role of a Lifetime.&quot;

==Personal life==
Keller supports the Sydney Roosters rugby league team in the Australian National Rugby League.

She has two adult sons with her husband Harley Oliver, and lives in the Sydney seaside suburb of Coogee. 

In October 2023 Keller revealed that her husband Harley has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.

==Other==
Keller is the patron of The Sydney Kids Committee, a volunteer organisation which raises funds for the Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital.

She holds the world record for the longest underwater radio broadcast which took place on 28 October 2010 when she and fellow WSFM breakfast show host Brendan Jones spent over three hours underwater at Sydney Aquarium.

In 2016 she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the Queens Birthday Honours
