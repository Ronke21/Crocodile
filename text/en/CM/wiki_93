<text>A dolphinarium is an aquarium for dolphins. The dolphins are usually kept in a pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or public performances. Some dolphinariums (sometimes called dolphinaria in plural) consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.

While cetaceans have been held in captivity since the 1860s, the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in 1938. Their popularity increased rapidly until the 1960s. Since the 1970s, increasing concern for animal welfare led to stricter regulation, which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums. Despite this trend, dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe, Japan and North America. The most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the bottlenose dolphin, as it is relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.

==History==

Though cetaceans have been held in captivity in both North America and Europe by 1860—Boston Aquarial Gardens in 1859 and pairs of beluga whales in Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York City museum— dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine, Florida. It was here that it was discovered that dolphins could be trained to perform tricks. Recognizing the success of Marine Studios, more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment. In the 1960s, keeping dolphins in zoos and aquariums for entertainment purposes increased in popularity after the 1963 &quot;Flipper&quot; movie and subsequent &quot;Flipper&quot; television series. In 1966, the first dolphin was exported to Europe. In these early days, dolphinariums could grow quickly due to a lack of legislation and lack of organised animal welfare.

New legislation, most notably the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States, combined with a more critical view on animal welfare, forced many dolphinariums around the world to close. A prominent example is the United Kingdom; in the early 1970s there were at least 36 dolphinariums and traveling dolphin shows, however, the last dolphinarium closed its doors in 1993. The last dolphinarium in Hungary was closed in 1992. In 2005 both Chile and Costa Rica prohibited keeping cetaceans captive. However, around 60 dolphinariums currently exist across Europe, of which 34 are within the EU. Japan, Mexico and the United States are also home to a relatively large number of dolphinariums.

==Design==

The water in the pools has to be constantly filtered to keep it clean for the dolphins and the temperature and composition of the water has to be controlled to match the conditions dolphins experience in the wild. In the absence of a common international regulation, guidelines regarding the minimum size of the pools vary between countries. To give an indication of pool sizes, the &quot;European Association for Aquatic Mammals&quot; recommends that a pool for five dolphins should have a surface area of plus an additional for every additional animal, have a depth of and have a water volume of at least with an additional for every additional animal. If two of these three conditions are met, and the third is not more than 10% below standard, the EAAM considers the pool size to be acceptable.

==Animals==
===Species===
Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity as well as several other small whale species such as harbour porpoises, finless porpoises and belugas, though in those cases the word dolphinarium may not be fitting as these are not true dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphins kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Orcas are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captive orcas being held in aquaria as of 2012.

The majority of orcas are located in the various SeaWorld parks in the United States. Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, gray whales, false killer whales, pilot whales and common dolphins, Commerson&#x27;s dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are fewer than ten Amazon river dolphins, Risso&#x27;s dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity. Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins (wolphins, a cross between the bottlenose dolphin and the false killer whale) are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. Also two common/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at Discovery Cove and the other SeaWorld San Diego.

===Trade and capture===

In the early days, many bottlenose dolphins were wild-caught off the coast of Florida. Though the Marine Mammal Protection Act, established in 1972, allows an exception for the collection of dolphins for public display and research purposes when a permit is obtained, bottlenose dolphins have not been captured in American waters since 1989. In most Western countries, breeding programs have been set up to provide the dolphinariums with new animals. To achieve a sufficient birth rate and to prevent inbreeding, artificial insemination (AI) is occasionally used. The use of AI also allows dolphinariums to increase the genetic diversity of their population without having to bring in any dolphins from other facilities.

The trade of dolphins is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (also known as the Washington Convention or CITES). Endangered dolphin species are included in CITES&#x27; Appendix I, in which case trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Species considered not to be threatened with extinction are included in Appendix II, in which case trade &quot;must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival&quot;. Most cetacean species traded for display in captivity to the public or for use in swimming with dolphins and other interaction programs are listed on Appendix II.

However, the dolphin trade still continues. A live bottlenose dolphin is estimated to be worth between a few thousand to several tens of thousands of US dollars, depending on age, condition and prior training. Captures are reported to be on the rise in the South Pacific and the Caribbean, Cuba has also been an exporter of dolphins in recent years, this being organized by the &quot;Acuario Nacional de Cuba&quot;. In recent years, the Solomon Islands have also allowed the collection and export of dolphins for public display facilities. A 2005 law banned the export of dolphins, however, this ban was seemingly overturned in 2007 when some 28 dolphins were shipped to Dubai.

==Criticism and legal bans==

===Animal welfare===
Many animal welfare groups such as the World Animal Protection consider keeping dolphins in captivity to be a form of animal abuse. The main arguments are that dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement in pools, regardless of pool size, (in the wild, dolphins swim hundreds of miles every day) and do not get enough stimulation. Dolphins often show repetitive behavior in captivity and sometimes become aggressive towards other animals or people. In some cases, the behavior of dolphins in captivity also results in their own death.

The lifespan of dolphins in captivity is another subject of debate. Research has shown that there is no significant difference between wild and captive survival rates for bottlenose dolphins. This does not, however, reflect a global state of affairs: for example, bottlenose dolphins in captive facilities in Jamaica suffer from extremely high mortality rates.

Some scientists suggest that the &quot;unusually high&quot; intelligence of dolphins means that they should be recognized as &quot;non-human persons&quot;. In 2013, the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests prohibited the captivity of dolphins on these grounds, finding it &quot;morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose&quot;.

===Legal bans or restrictions relating to keeping cetaceans in captivity===
According to animal rights organizations that monitor the subject, the following jurisdictions have full or partial bans on keeping dolphins in captivity: Bolivia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, India, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the American states California, New York, and South Carolina. Other countries have laws so restrictive that is virtually impossible to keep cetaceans in captivity: Brazil, Luxembourg, Nicaragua, Norway, and the United Kingdom. France tried to ban keeping or breeding cetaceans in captivity in 2017, but the ban was overturned on technical grounds by the Conseil d&#x27;État in 2018. On 29 September 2020, Environment Minister Barbara Pompili announced that France&#x27;s three remaining dolphinariums would be closed within the next 7 to 10 years, and no new dolphinariums could be opened, and no new marine mammals could be bred or imported.

* Belgium: On 31 August 2020, the Brussels Capital Region (which has no dolphinaria) announced it was working on a ban on any future creation of dolphinariums to safeguard the welfare of any marine mammals that might end up being kept within its territory. In November 2024, following earlier bans in Brussels and Wallonia, the Flanders region (home to the country&#x27;s last remaining dolphinarium: Boudewijn Seapark in Bruges) followed suit, meaning that a country-wide prohibition on dolphinariums was to be implemented by 2037 at the latest, but possibly sooner. Reportedly, this made Belgium the 7th country in the world, alongside &quot;India, Costa Rica, Chile, Croatia, Slovenia, and Cyprus, which have already implemented strict bans on the captivity of dolphins.&quot;
* Canada: In June 2019, the &quot;Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act&quot; became law in Canada. Two facilities would be affected, Marineland of Canada and the Vancouver Aquarium. When passed in June 2019, Marineland was reported to have 61 cetaceans, while the Vancouver Aquarium had just one dolphin remaining. The law has a grandfather clause, permitting those cetaceans already in captivity to remain where they are, but breeding and further acquisition of cetaceans is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions.
* France: Since September 2020, a phaseout of dolphinariums has been in progress in France (to be completed by 2027/30).
* Mexico: The Chamber of Deputies amended the General Wildlife Law in October 2022 to prohibit the use of marine mammals in commercial shows or for subsistence. Animals currently kept in captivity could be kept for the rest of their lives, but using them in shows was no longer permitted. The Mexican Senate confirmed the ban in 2023, but as of February 2024, several theme parks and aquariums were refusing to comply, using legal means to delay the law&#x27;s implementation, and seeking to overturn the ban.
* Switzerland: Dolphinariums are not technically prohibited, but there have been no dolphinariums in Switzerland since 2013, and it is practically impossible to set up and run a new one. The Animal Protection Act was amended in May 2012, stipulating: &quot;It is forbidden to import dolphins and other cetaceans (Cetacea).&quot; Therefore, the last facility that still kept cetaceans in Switzerland decided to close its dolphinarium by the end of 2013.

<doc id="1224764" wikidata="Q282385" url="?curid=1224764" title="Olive ridley sea turtle">
<text>The olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), also known commonly as the Pacific ridley sea turtle, is a species of turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is the second-smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles found in the world. &quot;L. olivacea&quot; is found in warm and tropical waters, primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but also in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean.

This turtle and the related Kemp&#x27;s ridley sea turtle are best known for their unique synchronised mass nestings called &quot;arribadas&quot;, where thousands of females come together on the same beach to lay eggs.

==Taxonomy==
The olive ridley sea turtle may have been first described as &quot;Testudo mydas minor&quot; by Georg Adolf Suckow in 1798. It was later described and named &quot;Chelonia multiscutata&quot; by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. Still later, it was described and named &quot;Chelonia olivacea&quot; by Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz in 1829. The species was placed in the subgenus &quot;Lepidochelys&quot; by Leopold Fitzinger in 1843. After &quot;Lepidochelys&quot; was elevated to full genus status, the species was called &quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot; by Charles Frédéric Girard in 1858. Because Eschscholtz was the first to propose the specific epithet &quot;olivacea&quot;, he is credited as the binomial authority or taxon author in the valid name &quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot; (Eschscholtz, 1829). The parentheses indicate that the species was originally described in a different genus.

The generic name, &quot;Lepidochelys&quot;, is derived from the Greek words &quot;lepidos&quot;, meaning scale, and &quot;chelys&quot;, which translates to turtle. This could possibly be a reference to the supernumerary costal scutes characteristic of this genus. The etymology of the English vernacular name &quot;olive&quot; is somewhat easier to resolve, as its carapace is olive green in color. However, the origin of &quot;ridley&quot; is unknown, perhaps derived from &quot;riddle&quot;. &quot;Lepidochelys&quot; is the only genus of sea turtles containing more than one extant species: &quot;L. olivacea&quot; and the closely related &quot;L. kempii&quot; (Kemp&#x27;s ridley).

==Description==
Growing to about in carapace length (measured along the curve), the olive ridley sea turtle gets its common name from its olive-colored carapace, which is heart-shaped and rounded. Males and females grow to the same size, but females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to males. The heart-shaped carapace is characterized by four pairs of pore-bearing inframarginal scutes on the bridge, two pairs of prefrontals, and up to nine lateral scutes per side. &quot;L. olivacea&quot; is unique in that it can have variable and asymmetrical lateral scute counts, ranging from five to nine plates on each side, with six to eight being most commonly observed. Each side of the carapace has 12–14 marginal scutes.

The carapace is flattened dorsally and highest anterior to the bridge. it has a medium-sized, broad head that appears triangular from above. The head&#x27;s concave sides are most obvious on the upper part of the short snout. It has paddle-like fore limbs, each having two anterior claws. The upper parts are grayish-green to olive in color, but sometimes appear reddish due to algae growing on the carapace. The bridge and hingeless plastron of an adult vary from greenish white in younger individuals to a creamy yellow in older specimens (maximum age is up to 50 years).

Hatchlings are dark gray with a pale yolk scar, but appear all black when wet. Carapace length of hatchlings ranges from . A thin, white line borders the carapace, as well as the trailing edge of the fore and hind flippers. Both hatchlings and juveniles have serrated posterior marginal scutes, which become smooth with age. Juveniles also have three dorsal keels; the central longitudinal keel gives younger turtles a serrated profile, which remains until sexual maturity is reached.

The olive ridley sea turtle rarely weighs over 50 kg (110 lb). Adults studied in Oaxaca, Mexico, ranged from ; adult females weighed an average of (n=58), while adult males weighed significantly less, averaging (n=17). Hatchlings usually weigh between .

Adults are sexually dimorphic. The mature male has a longer and thicker tail, which is used for copulation, and the presence of enlarged and hooked claws on the male&#x27;s front flippers allows him to grasp the female&#x27;s carapace during copulation. The male also has a longer, more tapered carapace than the female, which has a rounded, dome-like carapace. The male also has a more concave plastron, believed to be another adaptation for mating. The plastron of the male may also be softer than that of the female.

==Distribution==
The olive ridley turtle has a circumtropical distribution, living in tropical and warm waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans from India, Arabia, Japan, and Micronesia south to southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been observed off the western coast of Africa and the coasts of northern Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Venezuela. Additionally, the olive ridley has been recorded in the Caribbean Sea as far north as Puerto Rico. A female was found alive on an Irish Sea beach on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales, in November 2016, giving this species its northernmost appearance. It was taken in by the nearby Anglesey Sea Zoo, while its health was assessed. A juvenile female was found off the coast of Sussex in 2020. The olive ridley is also found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Galápagos Islands and Chile north to the Gulf of California, and along the Pacific coast to at least Oregon. Migratory movements have been studied less intensely in olive ridleys than other species of marine turtles, but they are believed to use the coastal waters of over 80 countries. Historically, this species has been widely regarded as the most abundant sea turtle in the world. More than one million olive ridleys were commercially harvested off the coasts of Mexico in 1968 alone.

The population of Pacific Mexico was estimated to be at least 10 million prior to the era of mass exploitation. More recently, the global population of annual nesting females has been reduced to about two million by 2004, and was further reduced to 852,550 by 2008. This indicated a dramatic decrease of 28 to 32% in the global population within only one generation (i.e., 20 years).

Olive ridley sea turtles are considered the most abundant, yet globally they have declined by more than 30% from historic levels. These turtles are considered endangered because of their few remaining nesting sites in the world. The eastern Pacific turtles have been found to range from Baja California, Mexico, to Chile. Pacific olive ridleys nest around Costa Rica, Mexico, Nicaragua, and the northern Indian Ocean; the breeding colony in Mexico was listed as endangered in the US on July 28, 1978.

===Nesting grounds===
Olive ridley turtles exhibit two different nesting behaviours: solitary nesting (the most prevalent) and synchronized mass nesting, termed &quot;arribadas&quot;. They are unique among sea turtle species in the latter behaviour, for which they are best known. Females return to the same beach from where they hatched, to lay their eggs. They lay their eggs in conical nests about 1.5 ft deep, which they laboriously dig with their hind flippers. In the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea near Honavar in  Karnataka , the majority of Olive Ridleys nest in two or three large assemblies near Gahirmatha in Odisha. The coast of Odisha in India is one of the largest mass nesting sites for the Olive Ridley, along with the coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica. In 1991, over 600,000 turtles nested along the coast of Odisha in one week. Solitary nesting also occurs in Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary in West Bengal &amp; along the Coromandel Coast and Sri Lanka, but in scattered locations. However, olive ridleys are considered a rarity in most areas of the Indian Ocean. Some nesting populations exist in islands of Bangladesh near Cox&#x27;s Bazar.

They are also rare in the western and central Pacific, with known &quot;arribadas&quot; occurring only within the tropical eastern Pacific, in Central America and Mexico. In Costa Rica, they occur at Nancite and Ostional beach, and a third &quot;arribada&quot; beach seems to be emerging at Corozalito. Two active &quot;arribada&quot; beaches are located in Nicaragua, Chacocente and La Flor, with a smaller &quot;arribada&quot; beach of unknown status on the Pacific coast of Panama. Historically, &quot;arribadas&quot; happened at several beaches in Mexico, but in the present &quot;arribadas&quot; are only observed at Playa Escobilla and Morro Ayuda in Oaxaca, and Ixtapilla in Michoacan.

Although olive ridleys are famed for their &quot;arribadas&quot;, most of the known nesting beaches are only frequented by solitarily nesting females and support a relatively small quantity of nests (100 to 3,000 nests). The overall contribution and importance of solitary nesting females to the population may be underestimated by the scientific community as the hatching success rate of nests at arribada beaches is generally low, but high at solitary nesting beaches.

Isolated, irregular nesting events also sporadically occur within the species&#x27; range.

===Foraging grounds===
Some of the olive ridley&#x27;s foraging grounds near Southern California are contaminated due to sewage, agricultural runoff, pesticides, solvents, and industrial discharges. These contaminants have been shown to decrease the productivity of the benthic community, which negatively affects these turtles, which feed from these communities. The increasing demand to build marinas and docks near Baja California and Southern California are also negatively affecting the olive ridleys in these areas, where more oil and gasoline will be released into these sensitive habitats. Another threat to these turtles is power plants, which have documented juvenile and subadult turtles becoming entrained and entrapped within the saltwater cooling intake systems.

==Ecology and behavior==
===Reproduction===
Mating is often assumed to occur in the vicinity of nesting beaches, but copulating pairs have been reported over 1,000 km from the nearest beach. Research from Costa Rica revealed the number of copulating pairs observed near the beach could not be responsible for the fertilization of the tens of thousands of gravid females, so a significant amount of mating is believed to have occurred elsewhere at other times of the year.

The Gahirmatha Beach in Kendrapara district of Odisha (India), which is now a part of the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, is the largest breeding ground for these turtles. The Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, which bounds the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary to the east, was created in September 1997, and encompasses Gahirmatha Beach and an adjacent portion of the Bay of Bengal. Bhitarkanika mangroves were designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2002. It is the world&#x27;s largest known rookery of olive ridley sea turtles. Apart from Gahirmatha rookery, two other mass nesting beaches have been located, which are on the mouth of rivers Rushikulya and Devi. The spectacular site of mass congregation of olive ridley sea turtles for mating and nesting enthralls both the scientists and the nature lovers throughout the world.

Olive ridley sea turtles migrate in huge numbers from the beginning of November, every year, for mating and nesting along the coast of Orissa. Gahirmatha coast has the annual nesting figure between 100,000 and 500,000 each year. A decline in the population of these turtles has occurred in the recent past due to mass mortality. The olive ridley sea turtle has been listed on Schedule – I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (amended 1991). The species is listed as vulnerable under IUCN. The sea turtles are protected under the &#x27;Migratory Species Convention&#x27; and Convention of International Trade on Wildlife Flora and Fauna (CITES). India is a signatory nation to all these conventions. The homing characteristics of the ridley sea turtles make them more prone to mass casualty. The voyage to the natal nesting beaches is the dooming factor for them. Since Gahirmatha coast serves as the natal nesting beach for millions of turtles, it has immense importance on turtle conservation.

Olive ridleys generally begin to aggregate near nesting beaches about two months before nesting season, although this may vary throughout their range. In the eastern Pacific, nesting occurs throughout the year, with peak nesting events (&quot;arribadas&quot;) occurring between September and December. Nesting beaches can be characterized as relatively flat, midbeach zone, and free of debris. Beach fidelity is common, but not absolute. Nesting events are usually nocturnal, but diurnal nesting has been reported, especially during large &quot;arribadas&quot;. Exact age of sexual maturity is unknown, but this can be somewhat inferred from data on minimum breeding size. For example, the average carapace length of nesting females (n = 251) at Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, was determined to be 63.3 cm, with the smallest recorded at 54.0 cm. Females can lay up to three clutches per season, but most only lay one or two clutches. The female remains near shore for the internesting period, which is about one month. Mean clutch size varies throughout its range and decreases with each nesting attempt.

A mean clutch size of 116 (30–168 eggs) was observed in Suriname, while nesting females from the eastern Pacific were found to have an average of 105 (74–126 eggs). The incubation period is usually between 45 and 51 days under natural conditions, but may extend to 70 days in poor weather conditions. Eggs incubated at temperatures of 31 to 32 °C produce only females; eggs incubated at 28 °C or less produce solely males; and incubation temperatures of 29 to 30 °C produce a mixed-sex clutch. Hatching success can vary by beach and year, due to changing environmental conditions and rates of nest predation.

===Habitat===
Most observations are typically within 15 km of mainland shores in protected, relatively shallow marine waters (22–55 m deep). Olive ridleys are occasionally found in open waters. The multiple habitats and geographical localities used by this species vary throughout its lifecycle. 

===Feeding===
The olive ridley is predominantly carnivorous. Common prey items include tunicates (salps and sea squirts), starfish, sea urchins, bryozoans, squid, bivalves, snails, barnacles, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and sipunculid worms. Additionally, consumption of jellyfish and both adult fish (e.g. &quot;Sphoeroides&quot;) and fish eggs may be indicative of pelagic (open ocean) feeding. The olive ridley is also known to feed on filamentous algae in areas devoid of other food sources. Captive studies have indicated some level of cannibalistic behavior in this species.

===Threats===
Known predators of olive ridley eggs include raccoons, coyotes, feral dogs and pigs, opossums, coatimundi, caimans, ghost crabs, and the sunbeam snake. Hatchlings are preyed upon as they travel across the beach to the water by vultures, frigate birds, crabs, raccoons, coyotes, iguanas, and snakes. In the water, hatchling predators most likely include oceanic fishes, sharks, and crocodiles. Adults have relatively few known predators, other than sharks and crocodiles, and killer whales are responsible for occasional attacks. On land, nesting females may be attacked by jaguars. Notably, the jaguar is the only cat with a strong enough bite to penetrate a sea turtle&#x27;s shell, thought to be an evolutionary adaption from the Holocene extinction event. In observations of jaguar attacks, the cats consumed the neck muscles of the turtle and occasionally the flippers, but left the remainder of the turtle carcass for scavengers as most likely, despite the strength of its jaws, a jaguar still cannot easily penetrate an adult turtle&#x27;s shell to reach the internal organs or other muscles. In recent years, increased predation on turtles by jaguars has been noted, perhaps due to habitat loss and fewer alternative food sources. Sea turtles are comparatively defenseless in this situation, as they cannot pull their heads into their shells like freshwater and terrestrial turtles. Females are often plagued by mosquitos during nesting. Humans are still listed as the leading threat to &quot;L. olivacea&quot;, responsible for unsustainable egg collection, slaughtering nesting females on the beach, and direct harvesting adults at sea for commercial sale of both the meat and hides.

Other major threats include mortality associated with boat collisions, and incidental takes in fisheries. Trawling, gill nets, ghost nests, longline fishing, and pot fishing have significantly affected olive ridley populations, as well as other species of marine turtles. Between 1993 and 2003, more than 100,000 olive ridley turtles were reported dead in Odisha, India from fishery-related practices. In addition, entanglement and ingestion of marine debris is listed as a major threat for this species. Coastal development, natural disasters, climate change, and other sources of beach erosion have also been cited as potential threats to nesting grounds. Additionally, coastal development also threatens newly hatched turtles through the effects of light pollution. Hatchlings which use light cues to orient themselves to the sea are now misled into moving towards land, and die from dehydration or exhaustion, or are killed on roads.

The greatest single cause of olive ridley egg loss, though, results from &quot;arribadas&quot;, in which the density of nesting females is so high, previously laid nests are inadvertently dug up and destroyed by other nesting females. In some cases, nests become cross-contaminated by bacteria or pathogens of rotting nests. For example, in Playa Nancite, Costa Rica, only 0.2% of the 11.5 million eggs produced in a single &quot;arribada&quot; successfully hatched. Although some of this loss resulted from predation and high tides, the majority was attributed to conspecifics unintentionally destroying existing nests. The extent to which &quot;arribadas&quot; contribute to the population status of olive ridleys has created debate among scientists. Many believe the massive reproductive output of these nesting events is critical to maintaining populations, while others maintain the traditional &quot;arribada&quot; beaches fall far short of their reproductive potential and are most likely not sustaining population levels. In some areas, this debate eventually led to legalizing egg collection.

==Economic importance==
Historically, the olive ridley has been exploited for food, bait, oil, leather, and fertilizer. The meat is not considered a delicacy; the egg, however, is esteemed everywhere. Egg collection is illegal in most of the countries where olive ridleys nest, but these laws are rarely enforced. Harvesting eggs has the potential to contribute to local economies, so the unique practice of allowing a sustainable (legal) egg harvest has been attempted in several localities. Numerous case studies have been conducted in regions of &quot;arribadas&quot; beaches to investigate and understand the socioeconomic, cultural, and political issues of egg collection. Of these, the legal egg harvest at Ostional, Costa Rica, has been viewed by many as both biologically sustainable and economically viable. Since egg collection became legal in 1987, local villagers have been able to harvest and sell around three million eggs annually. They are permitted to collect eggs during the first 36 hours of the nesting period, as many of these eggs would be destroyed by later nesting females. Over 27 million eggs are left unharvested, and villagers have played a large role in protecting these nests from predators, thereby increasing hatching success.

Most participating households reported egg harvesting as their most important activity, and profits earned were superior to other forms of available employment, other than tourism. The price of Ostional eggs was intentionally kept low to discourage illegal collection of eggs from other beaches. The Ostional project retained more local profits than similar egg-collection projects in Nicaragua, but evaluating egg-harvesting projects such as this suffers from the short timeline and site specificity of findings. In most regions, illegal poaching of eggs is considered a major threat to olive ridley populations, thus the practice of allowing legal egg harvests continues to attract criticism from conservationists and sea turtle biologists. Plotkin&#x27;s &quot;Biology and Conservation of Ridley Sea Turtles&quot;, particularly the chapter by Lisa Campbell titled &quot;Understanding Human Use of Olive Ridleys&quot;, provides further research on the Ostional harvest (as well as other harvesting projects). Scott Drucker&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Between the Harvest&quot;, offers a glimpse into this world and the debate surrounding it.

==Conservation status==
The olive ridley is classified as vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, and is listed in Appendix I of CITES. These listings were largely responsible for halting the large-scale commercial exploitation and trade of olive ridley skins. The Convention on Migratory Species and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles have also provided olive ridleys with protection, leading to increased conservation and management for this marine turtle. National listings for this species range from endangered to threatened, yet enforcing these sanctions on a global scale has been unsuccessful for the most part. Conservation successes for the olive ridley have relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local communities and nongovernment organizations, which focused primarily on public outreach and education. &quot;Arribada&quot; management has also played a critical role in conserving olive ridleys. Lastly, enforcing the use of turtle excluder devices in the shrimp-trawling industry has also proved effective in some areas. Globally, the olive ridley continues to receive less conservation attention than its close relative, Kemp&#x27;s ridley (&quot;L. kempii&quot;). Also, many schools arrange trips for students to carry out the conservation project, especially in India.

Another major project in India involved in preserving the olive ridley sea turtle population was carried out in Chennai, where the Chennai wildlife team collected close to 10,000 eggs along the Marina coast, of which 8,834 hatchlings were successfully released into the sea in a phased manner.

In March 2023, in Honnavar, India, local fishers sighted 86 sea turtle nests, with over 5,000 eggs in them, along a 3-km stretch of beach between Apsarakonda and Pavinkorava. The highest number of nests previously recorded in the area, 34, was in 2008.

<doc id="1224766" wikidata="Q1191063" url="?curid=1224766" title="Linguistic purism in English">
<text>Purism in the linguistic field is the historical trend of languages to conserve intact their lexical structure of word families, in opposition to foreign influences which are considered &#x27;impure&#x27;. Historically, linguistic purism in English is a reaction to the great number of borrowings in the English language from other languages, especially Old French, since the Norman conquest of England, and some of its native vocabulary and grammar have been supplanted by features of Latinate and Greek origin. Efforts to remove or consider the removal of foreign terms in English are often known as Anglish, a term coined by author and humorist Paul Jennings in 1966.

English linguistic purism has persisted in diverse forms since the inkhorn term controversy of the early modern period. In its mildest form, purism stipulates the use of native terms instead of loanwords. In stronger forms, new words are coined from Germanic roots (such as &quot;&quot; for &quot;vocabulary&quot;) or revived from older stages of English (such as &quot;&quot; for &quot;proceed&quot;). Noted purists of Early Modern English include John Cheke, Thomas Wilson, Ralph Lever, Richard Rowlands, and Nathaniel Fairfax. Modern linguistic purists include William Barnes, Charles Dickens, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Elias Molee, Percy Grainger, and George Orwell.

==History==

===Middle English===

English words gave way to borrowings from Anglo-Norman following the Norman Conquest as English lost ground as a language of prestige. Anglo-Norman was used in schools and dominated literature, nobility and higher life, leading a wealth of French loanwords to enter English over the course of several centuries—English only returned to courts of law in 1362, and to government in the following century.

Notwithstanding, some texts of early Middle English engaged in linguistic purism, deliberately avoiding excessive Anglo-Norman influence. Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, composed in the late 12th or early 13th century, espoused several features of Old English poetic style and used a predominantly Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot;, of the same era, allowed for French and Old Norse loans but maintained conservative spelling and syntax to keep with Old English. &quot;Ayenbite of Inwyt&quot;, a Kentish translation of a French treatise on morality written about a century earlier, used calques to avoid borrowing from French.

===Early Modern English===
Controversy over inkhorn terms—foreign loanwords perceived to be needless—persisted in the 16th and 17th centuries. Among others, Thomas Elyot, a neologiser, borrowed extensively from abroad in support of &quot;the necessary augmentation&quot; of English. Linguistic purists such as John Cheke opposed this borrowing in favour of keeping English &quot;unmixt and unmangled&quot;. Thomas Wilson, a contemporary of Cheke, criticised borrowing from foreign languages as seeking an &quot;outlandish English&quot;.

===Modern English===

With the influx of new industrial and scientific terms from Greek and Latin, linguistic purism saw renewed interest in the 19th century. American statesman Thomas Jefferson observed in an 1825 letter that &quot;a taste is reviving in England for the recovery of the Anglo-Saxon dialect&quot;. Dorset poet, minister, and philologist William Barnes coined several words to promote &quot;strong old Anglo-Saxon speech&quot;, including &quot;&quot; for &quot;grammar&quot;, &quot;&quot; for &quot;ornithology&quot;, and &quot;&quot; for &quot;flexible&quot;. Poet Gerard Manley Hopkins discussed Barnes in an 1882 letter to Robert Bridges, lamenting the &quot;utter hopelessness&quot; of Barnes&#x27;s purism but nonetheless writing in support of it, claiming that &quot;no beauty in a language can make up for want of purity&quot;. Charles Dickens emphasised the importance of Germanic elements of English during this period, stressing that a writer should not &quot;seek abroad&quot; for new words.

The fifth rule of vocabulary in &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot;, published in 1917, suggests that writers should &quot;prefer the Saxon word to the Romance&quot;. In his 1946 essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;, George Orwell criticised the extensive use of &quot;foreign&quot; words in English. Australian composer Percy Grainger, a contemporary of Orwell, invented a &quot;blue-eyed English&quot; that he perceived to be linguistically pure and preferred the use of English words in the place of traditional Italian music terms. One year after Grainger&#x27;s death, philologist Lee Hollander emphasised in his 1962 translation of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;—a collection of Old Norse poems—that &quot;Germanic material must be drawn upon to the utmost extent ... because of the tang and flavor still residing in the homelier indigenous speech material&quot;.

Paul Jennings coined the term &quot;Anglish&quot; in a three-part series in &quot;Punch&quot; commemorating the 900th anniversary of the Norman conquest of England. Jennings&#x27;s articles, entitled &quot;1066 and All Saxon&quot; and published in June 1966, envisioned an England in which the conquest had failed and included linguistically pure English passages; Jennings gave &quot;a bow to William Barnes&quot; as an inspiration. In 1989, science fiction writer Poul Anderson released a similarly-written text about basic atomic theory called &quot;Uncleftish Beholding&quot; composed almost fully of Germanic-rooted words. In 1997, Douglas Hofstadter jokingly entitled the style &quot;Ander-Saxon&quot;.

The September 2009 publication &quot;How We&#x27;d Talk if the English had Won in 1066&quot; by David Cowley updates Old English words to today&#x27;s English spelling, seeking mainstream appeal by covering words in five grades ranging from &quot;easy&quot; to &quot;weird and wonderful&quot; and giving many examples of use with drawings and tests. Paul Kingsnorth&#x27;s 2014 &quot;The Wake&quot; is written in a hybrid of Old English and Modern English to account for its 1066 milieu, and Edmund Fairfax&#x27;s 2017 satiric literary novel &quot;Outlaws&quot; is similarly written in a &quot;constructed&quot; form of English consisting almost exclusively of words of Germanic origin. An online newsletter called &quot;The Anglish Times&quot; has regularly reported on current events without non-Germanic borrowed words since January 2021.

<text>Robert George Taylor (7 December 1932 – 18 June 1981) was a British Conservative politician.

==Background==
Taylor was born in 1932, and attended Cranleigh School. He worked in architectural ironmongery, becoming an executive with the G and S Allgood company. He served as a parachutist in the Territorial Army.

In 1964, he married Rosemary Box, and they had two children.

==Parliamentary career==
Taylor fought Battersea North in 1959 and 1964, but was defeated each time by Labour&#x27;s Douglas Jay.

He was Member of Parliament for Croydon North West from 1970 until he died from a heart attack at his home in Surrey on 18 June 1981, aged 48, 11 years to the day after his election to parliament. In the subsequent by-election, the Conservatives lost the seat to Liberal Bill Pitt.

<doc id="1224786" wikidata="Q4391031" url="?curid=1224786" title="1985 (SR-71 song)">
<text>&quot;1985&quot; is a song that was written and recorded by American pop-punk band SR-71 for their album &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;. Mitch Allan, SR-71&#x27;s frontman, gave the song to pop-punk band Bowling for Soup, who recorded a cover version that reached number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was included on the band&#x27;s album &quot;A Hangover You Don&#x27;t Deserve&quot;.

The song is about a middle-aged woman who is longing for her past and dwelling on her current mundane lifestyle while reflecting on how things have changed since the 1980s, specifically in music and pop culture.

==Background==
The song was originally written by SR-71 frontman Mitch Allan and drummer John Allen for the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Here We Go Again.&quot; The album was initially only made available in Japan.

==Bowling for Soup version==
There are conflicting stories on how Bowling for Soup came to record a cover version of the track. According to SR-71&#x27;s website, Bowling for Soup&#x27;s Jaret Reddick heard the song and asked for permission to record a cover. However, according to Bowling for Soup&#x27;s website, it was Allan that called Reddick to suggest the possible cover. In a 2010 interview with &quot;Songfacts&quot;, Reddick said that the cover materialized through the two bands’ association with producer Butch Walker. 

Bowling for Soup made some changes to the lyrics of the original song. In the second verse, the reference to the film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; is replaced by &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;. The line &quot;Never knew George was gay/hoped they&#x27;d hook up one day&quot; is changed to &quot;Thought she&#x27;d get a hand/on a member of Duran Duran.&quot; 

The ending lines &quot;Where&#x27;s her fairytale? Where&#x27;s her dream? / Where&#x27;s the quarterback from her high school football team? / How many times will she ask herself &#x27;What happened to me?&#x27;&quot; are changed to &quot;Where&#x27;s the mini-skirt made of snakeskin? / And who&#x27;s the other guy that&#x27;s singing in Van Halen? / When did reality become TV? / Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows (on the radio)?&quot;. The line &quot;(The rubber broke!)&quot; after &quot;&#x27;What happened?&#x27;&quot; is omitted. 

Bowling for Soup added the line &quot;And when did Ozzy become an actor?&quot; to the bridge, referencing rock singer Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s appearance in the reality TV show &quot;The Osbournes&quot;. 

===Release===
Released on July 26, 2004, the song climbed to number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Digital Tracks chart, with 15,500 paid downloads.

===Music video===
The music video is directed by Smith n&#x27; Borin (Ryan Smith and Frank Borin). It takes place on a neighborhood street where the character of Debbie (Joey House) tidies the lawn of her house but gets distracted by Bowling for Soup performing in their garage across the street. The band parodies the music videos for Robert Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; and George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;, as well as the acts Run-DMC and Mötley Crüe. At the end of the video, Debbie walks across the street to the band, lets her hair down, and in a nod to Whitesnake&#x27;s video for &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, writhes on top of a Jaguar. She continues to do this even after the song ends, until her husband calls out to ask her what she’s doing. Mitch Allan from SR-71 appears in the video as a passerby who gives the band a look of contempt.

==Cover versions and parodies==
Christian parody band ApologetiX released a parody titled &quot;None Too Ladylike&quot; on the group&#x27;s &quot;Wordplay&quot; album, about Jezebel from the Bible.

The Bowling for Soup version has been covered by Richard Thompson on the live album &quot;1000 Years of Popular Music&quot;.

On July 9, 2022, Thomas Ian Nicholas released a parody cover of &quot;1985&quot; titled &quot;1999&quot;.

In 2013, Jaret Reddick re-covered the song for Munch&#x27;s Make Believe Band, the band featured in Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s restaurants. In the segment, one of the characters references the voice of Chuck E. Cheese being the same as Bowling for Soup&#x27;s front man.

On January 27, 2023, Davvn released a parody cover entitled &quot;2002&quot;. The song was initially a 35-second YouTube Short posted on September 25, 2021, but was re-uploaded to TikTok the following year where it gained traction after Jaret Reddick saw it and subsequently collaborated with Davvn. The song was officially released featuring Bowling for Soup.

In 2024, Kelly Clarkson covered &quot;1985&quot; on the &#x27;Kellyoke&#x27; section of The Kelly Clarkson Show.

<text>Jody Vanessa Watley (born January 30, 1959) is an American singer, songwriter and producer whose music crosses genres including pop, R&amp;B, jazz, dance and electronic soul. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, she was a member of the R&amp;B/funk band Shalamar, who scored many hits, notably in the UK. In 1988, she won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist (as a solo artist) and has been nominated for three Grammy awards.

In 2008, she was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, and was also prominently featured in the historic black issue of &quot;Vogue Italia&quot; in 2008.

In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as the 21st-most-successful dance artist of all time, and in 2017 Black Music Honors TV special recognized Watley as Crossover Music Icon Honoree for her groundbreaking achievements and influence.

In August 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Jody Watley as one of the top female artists of all time, at number 53.

In March 2021, Jody Watley was named the First Ambassador of the National Museum of African American Music.

In 2022, Jody Watley received an honorary doctorate in business and Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award from Joe Biden at Jody Watley Day at Georgia State Capitol, and was inducted into Women Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In 2023, Sirius XM Satellite Radio launched &quot;The Jody Watley Show&quot;, a monthly life, music and culture show featuring celebrity guests and classic R&amp;B hits.

== Youth and early career ==
=== 1977–1983: &quot;Soul Train&quot; and Shalamar ===

Watley was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Watley made her first stage appearance at eight years old with family friend and godfather Jackie Wilson. She got her start on the TV dance show &quot;Soul Train&quot; at the age of 14. At Dorsey High School she was voted &#x27;best dancer&#x27; in her senior class poll. Documented by &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1977 as a part of &quot;The New Generation,&quot; Jody Watley was one of the most popular dancers on the show and recognized as a trendsetter for her style and dance moves.
As standouts on the television show, Watley and fellow &quot;Soul Train&quot; dancer Jeffrey Daniel were selected to join Gary Mumford and become original members of the R&amp;B group Shalamar by show creator Don Cornelius. (Mumford was shortly replaced by Gerald Brown, and Brown himself was soon replaced by Howard Hewett as lead vocalist.) The lineup of Hewett, Watley and Daniel would be the most successful. Watley remained with Shalamar from 1977 to 1983. The trio released several albums and scored several hits on both the pop and R&amp;B charts including &quot;Take That to the Bank&quot;, &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, &quot;Make That Move&quot;, &quot;For the Lover In You&quot;, &quot;Dead Giveaway&quot; and &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;. Because of conflicts within the group, disagreements about the artistic direction of Shalamar with Dick Griffey, and lack of payment from Solar Records, she finally left the group in 1983, prior to the release of &quot;The Look&quot; album.

After leaving Shalamar in 1984, Watley moved to England, and while there she recorded a guest vocal with British Jamaican roots reggae group Musical Youth for their album, &quot;Different Style!&quot;. She also recorded with Gary Langan, Anne Dudley and J. J. Jeczalik (who later became Art of Noise). She had a brief stint with Phonogram Records where two singles were released (in the UK, Europe and Australia—though crucially not America) under the mononym &#x27;Jody&#x27;: &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot; and &quot;Girls Night Out&quot;. Also during this era, and after departing the group, she took part in Bob Geldof&#x27;s Band Aid recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, which included Bono, Boy George, Sting, George Michael, Phil Collins, Status Quo, Paul Weller, Bananarama and other prominent Irish and British artists.

== Solo career ==
=== 1987–1988: &quot;Jody Watley&quot; and commercial breakthrough ===

After two-and-a-half years in England, Watley returned to America and secured a recording deal with MCA Records, eager to establish her own identity. Her debut solo studio album, titled &quot;Jody Watley&quot;, was released in March 1987, and she co-wrote six of the album&#x27;s nine songs with partner André Cymone, who also produced her first four albums. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Watley would say that she wanted to showcase her voice against &quot;really funky hard dance tracks&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Looking for a New Love&quot;, became a hit and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album peaked at number ten on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and sold two million copies in the United States and a total of four million copies worldwide. It produced five uptempo dance and R&amp;B singles that charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with three peaking within the top ten: &quot;Looking for a New Love&quot; (#2), &quot;Still a Thrill&quot; (#56), &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; (#6), &quot;Some Kind of Lover&quot; (#10) and &quot;Most of All&quot; (#60) Also included on her debut album was a duet with George Michael, &quot;Learn to Say No&quot;, produced by Bernard Edwards of Chic fame.

At the 30th Annual Grammy Awards of 1988, Watley won the award for Best New Artist, and was nominated for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. That same year, she also received nominations for two MTV Video Music Awards and three Soul Train Awards. After Shalamar she had two singles released under the name of &#x27;Jody&#x27;, without her last name even though adverts in UK pop magazine &quot;Smash Hits&quot; mentioned that she was &quot;formerly of Shalamar&quot;. This &quot;technicality&quot; (no second name), allowed her controversially to be considered a &quot;New Artist&quot; at the Grammys, beating Breakfast Club, Cutting Crew, Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby and Swing Out Sister. Shortly after winning the Grammy, Watley would be featured in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine photographed by Francesco Scavullo.

=== 1989–1990: &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; and continued success ===

In the spring of 1989, Watley released her second studio album, &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;, co-writing eleven of the album&#x27;s twelve songs. The album sold over four million copies worldwide, reaching number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and produced four singles: &quot;Real Love&quot; Certified Gold by RIAA (US #2, #1 R&amp;B, #2 Dance, UK #31), a Gold-certificated single and her first Top 40 UK single since &quot;Looking for a New Love&quot; in 1987; &quot;Friends&quot; featuring Eric B. &amp; Rakim (US #9, #3 R&amp;B, #7 Dance, UK #21) was the first R&amp;B, Pop, Rap, Dance collaboration to cross over Top 10 on multiple charts; and &quot;Everything&quot; (US #4, #3 R&amp;B), her first ballad released as a single. The album&#x27;s fourth and final single, &quot;Precious Love&quot;, was a minor hit, peaking at number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Friends&quot; is notable for being the first multi-format hit single to include the formula of a pop star featuring a guest rapper with the custom full 16-bar verses and bridge concept, and distinguishable from the rap &quot;Intro&quot; by Melle Mel on Chaka Khan&#x27;s notable cover of Prince&#x27;s song &quot;I Feel for You&quot;. The successful &quot;Friends&quot; formula would become a mainstay formula in commercial pop music and was added as a category at the Grammys under Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2002.

During the summer of 1989, the &quot;Real Love&quot; video, directed by Hollywood director David Fincher, was nominated for seven MTV Video Music Awards including Breakthrough Video, Best Art Direction, Best Dance Video and Best Female Video at the 1989 ceremony. That record was held until Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson&#x27;s video &quot;Scream&quot; received 11 VMA nominations in 1995. The next year, she was nominated for two Soul Train Awards, an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Female Artist, and a Narm Award for Best Selling R&amp;B Female Album. While riding high on her &quot;Larger Than Life World Tour&quot;, a remix album, titled &quot;You Wanna Dance with Me?&quot;, was released in October 1989 and achieved Gold status in America. 1989 also saw Watley featured in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; &quot;Ten Most Beautiful Women&quot; issue, photographed by Matthew Rolston. That same year Watley appeared on the cover of the Japanese high-fashion magazine &quot;SPUR&quot; for its debut issue.
Watley released the million-selling &quot;Dance to Fitness&quot;—a first for an African-American woman and artist.

=== 1991–1992: &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot; and change in style ===

Watley would state that she was eager to change her musical range and image, and no longer wanted to be seen as just a dance diva.
She was inspired toward a more introspective approach for &quot;Affairs Of The Heart&quot;, wanting to address social concerns. In December 1991, Watley released her third album, &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot;, described by Justin Kantor in &quot;Guide to Soul&quot; as an overlooked standout of her 1980s and 1990s output. The album peaked at No. 124 on the U.S. chart, and #21 on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart.

The lead single, &quot;I Want You,&quot; failed to crack the top 40, peaking at No. 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, though peaking at No. 5 on the U.S. R&amp;B singles chart, and #17 Dance. The second single, &quot;I&#x27;m the One You Need&quot;, reached No. 3 Dance and peaked at No. 19 on the U.S. Hot 100. The final single was the ballad &quot;It All Begins with You&quot;, her first single to miss the U.S. Hot 100. Watley earned an invitation by President George H. W. Bush in 1992 to perform this song at the White House. Watley used the opportunity to encourage the government to provide more support and funding for public schools. Watley recorded &quot;It&#x27;s All There&quot; for the movie &quot;Switch&quot; with the composer Henry Mancini.

=== 1993–1994: &quot;Intimacy&quot; ===

Apparently undeterred by disappointing sales, Watley stated she was more concerned with broadening her creative boundaries than in having huge record sales.
In November 1993, MCA released her fourth solo album, the introspective relationship-themed &quot;Intimacy&quot;. Noting that new jack swing was the emerging popular subgenre of R&amp;B at the time, Amy Linden wrote in &quot;People&quot; magazine that &quot;Intimacy&quot; continued the process of Watley&#x27;s move toward more refreshingly adult themes and that Watley was deserving of serious attention. Watley herself said that the songs she wrote were always personal statements.

&quot;Intimacy&quot; with its songs of &quot;romance and angst&quot; reached No. 164 on the U.S. Top 200 Album Chart and No. 38 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. The first single was &quot;Your Love Keeps Working On Me&quot;, barely scraped onto the Hot 100 at No. 100 and also peaked at No. 2 Dance and No. 26 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop. Watley added video director to her résumé for the next single, the spoken-word tune &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;. &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; reached No. 11 Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop and U.S. No. 8 Dance. Although not a pop hit in the U.S. or UK as well, the BBG remix of this song topped the Dance charts in the UK. The album also contained the song &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, produced by David Morales, which became an underground hit and later appeared on her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection. Like its predecessor, &quot;Intimacy&quot; would not be a strong seller, but would continue to give Watley better critical success.

=== 1995: &quot;Affection&quot; ===
Having parted ways with MCA Records, Watley took an independent path and started her own label, Avitone Records, and released her fifth studio album, &quot;Affection&quot;, in July 1995. The album was engineered and produced by the Booker T. Jones and Angelo Earl. She aligned Avitone with the independent Bellmark Records for distribution. According to a review of the album &quot;Affection&quot; by Jose Promis of &quot;AllMusic&quot;, the release lacked the urgency and immediency of her dance-era hits, but was an engaging collection of slow burners, mid-tempo and jazzy R&amp;B. The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Affection&quot;, didn&#x27;t crack the Hot 100 but became a moderate R&amp;B hit, peaking at No. 28 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart.

=== 1996: &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album ===
 In 1996, Watley played Rizzo in the musical &quot;Grease&quot; on Broadway theater in New York City, the first African-American woman to play the role. Watley was photographed by Victor Skrebneski for the Saks Fifth Avenue Defining Style Fall Catalog, where she appeared in a 15-page high-fashion layout. That fall, Watley appeared on the platinum-selling single &quot;This Is For The Lover In You&quot; by Babyface. The single also featured LL Cool J and Watley&#x27;s former Shalamar bandmates Howard Hewett and Jeffrey Daniel, essentially reforming the group for the single. It was a remake of Shalamar&#x27;s R&amp;B hit &quot;For the Lover In You&quot;. As the year wound to a close, Watley took a hiatus from her own Avitone label, and signed with Big Beat/Atlantic Records. The same year MCA Records released her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album with Watley&#x27;s recordings for MCA.

=== 1997–1998: &quot;Flower&quot; ===
After spending most of 1997 in the recording studio crafting her sixth studio album, &quot;Flower&quot;, Watley was back in early 1998 with its lead singles &quot;Off the Hook&quot; and &quot;If I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot;. &quot;Off The Hook&quot; peaked at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Singles Chart and No. 73 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but fared much better on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Propelled by remixes from Masters at Work and Soul Solution, the track reached No. 1 on the dance chart, making it her first No. 1 Hot Dance Music/Club Play hit in nine years. Later the same year, a single of &quot;If I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot; was released, with promo mixes by Sal Dano (credited as BK Dano), Lenny Bertoldo and 95 North (Richard Payton and Doug Smith) and that song reached No. 2 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Big Beat Records was absorbed into its parent label, Atlantic Records, which then shelved the album from a U.S. release, and left Watley in legal limbo for two years. &quot;Flower&quot; was, however, released in Canada, the UK and Japan. The critically acclaimed release was championed by many British magazines, including &quot;Blues and Soul&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; among others.
A previously unreleased song featuring Watley with George Duke titled &quot;Baby Love&quot; was included as a bonus track on &quot;The Best of George Duke: The Electra Years&quot; in 1997.

=== 1999: &quot;The Saturday Night Experience Volume 1&quot; ===
It was during the time she was unable to record, that Watley says she was inspired by 4Hero, whose 1998 album &quot;Two Pages&quot; exposed her to the underground electronic dance music outside of the mainstream; she credits this inspiration for not retiring after the disappointment of how &quot;Flower&quot; was handled.

In November 1999, Jody reactivated her independent label, Avitone, and released her seventh studio album via Universal Japan &quot;The Saturday Night Experience featuring Jody Watley Vol. 1&quot;, a collection of organic club music tracks, inspired by her newfound love of electronic music. It was released exclusively in Japan along with a single, &quot;Another Chapter,&quot; with remixes by DJ Soma. Also included on the project was the drum and bass title song &quot;Saturday Night Experience&quot;. As Watley told music historian David Nathan, &quot;&quot;The Saturday Night Experience&quot; was intended to be a concept album, aimed at people looking for something different.&quot; Watley stated she had no desire to release the project in the U.S. The title song of the same name was licensed to Giant Step and included on their compilation &quot;Giant Sessions, Volume 1 Mixed by Ron Trent&quot;. The following year, MCA released &quot;20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: The Best of Jody Watley&quot;.

=== 2001–2005: &quot;Midnight Lounge&quot; ===

In 2001, Jody released her eighth studio album, &quot;Midnight Lounge&quot; in Europe and Japan. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Watley would say, &quot;An artist should always explore new frontiers.&quot; &quot;Midnight Lounge&quot; was a collection of tracks that combined a blend of soul, jazz, R&amp;B and electronic club music.

After achieving moderate success in its original release, Watley arranged for it to be released in the U.S. through her Avitone imprint in a short-term license deal with Shanachie Records on March 11, 2003. &quot;Midnight Lounge&quot; was Watley&#x27;s first studio album released in the U.S. in eight years, reaching Top 20 status on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart. Roy Ayers appeared on the Masters at Work-produced &quot;I Love to Love&quot;, and Junior Vasquez and several other producers contributed remixes to the single release of &quot;Whenever&quot;, bringing the track to No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance/Club Play Chart. One of the album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;Photographs&quot;, became notable in the underground club scene with mixes by Phil Asher and East West Connection. The music and growth of Watley would achieve critical acclaim for the project and Watley, noting she had successfully updated her sound over the years and evolved successfully into a soulful chanteuse.

In 2005, Watley made history on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play Chart when she re-released her 1987 hit &quot;Looking For a New Love&quot; on Curvve Recordings. The 2005 remix reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Club Play chart, making her the first artist ever to take the same song to No. 1 in two different decades. Jody Watley now has the distinction of being among the few artists who have been to No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in all of the past three decades (the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s). The same year, Watley was invited to participate in the Force of Nature Relief Concert to aid the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. During the trip Watley and others (including the Black Eyed Peas, Lauryn Hill and Jackie Chan) were invited to the Royal Palace to meet the King and Queen of Malaysia for a special tea reception in showing their gratitude for all involved with Force of Nature.

=== 2006–2014: &quot;The Makeover&quot; ===
The Makeover would bring Watley together with 4Hero and King Britt among others in an electronic musical style. Understanding the shifting paradigms in the music industry and the changing business models, Watley&#x27;s Avitone Recordings arranged for &quot;The Makeover&quot; to be released exclusively to the Virgin Megastore chain in its first ever CD exclusive. It debuted at No. 1 for the retailer, and was accompanied by a Virgin mini-tour where she performed for customers and signed copies of the CD. The first single was a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Borderline&quot;. The single reached No. 2 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in January 2007. The second single, a cover of Chic&#x27;s &quot;I Want Your Love,&quot; reached No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play in June 2007.
In 2007, Watley was listed as No. 5 in the Year-end &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Play Artists. Her single &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; was No. 15 and &quot;Borderline&quot; No. 19 according to &quot;Billboard&quot; Year End Chart Review for 2007. In January 2008, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; topped the UK Dance Charts in January, giving her first UK mainstream dance hit in two decades. In 2008, she launched an online music store, while scoring another Top Five &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Single, &quot;A Beautiful Life,&quot; bringing the total of Top Five Singles for &quot;The Makeover&quot; to three. In May 2008, continuing over a decade of support for various charities dedicated to raising funds and awareness for HIV and AIDS, Watley performed at Life Ball, Europe&#x27;s largest gala for the cause held in Vienna, Austria. In May 2009, Watley&#x27;s Avitone signed a distribution deal with London-based Alternative Distribution Alliance Global.

In October 2009, an &quot;International&quot; version of &quot;The Makeover&#x27; was released in the UK to positive reviews. Pete Lewis from &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot; noted her evolution as an artist and performer as being showcased on the album. Further stating Watley being hailed by some, as exemplifying the 21st-century recording artist continuing to exercise her own creative path. Distinguishable from the original release, The Makeover &quot;International Edition&quot; featured new cover art and track listing. New inclusions featured the bossa-soul rendering of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot;, a sparsely arranged version of Carole King&#x27;s 1960s ballad &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, Erasure&#x27;s anthem &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, and a reworking of the Diana Ross dance classic &quot;Love Hangover&quot;. Replacing the downtempo ambient version found on the 2006 &quot;The Makeover&quot;, Watley recorded the new arrangement originally suggested by songwriter Pam Sawyer, for Ross.
Reg Dancy from Basic Soul would write that Watley was able to handpick songs and make them seem as if they had been written for her.
Added to the lineup of producers which included King Britt, Mark de Clive-Lowe, 4Hero, DJ Spinna and longtime co-collaborator Rodney Lee, are remixer/producers Marco Zappala from Brazil and Craig C. from the UK.

In February 2010, Jody Watley joined Jamie Foxx onstage at a post-Grammy event for a duet performance of her signature hit &quot;Looking For a New Love&quot; and also appeared in the VH1 documentary &quot;Soul Train: The Hippest Trip In America&quot;. On October 27, 2012, Watley starred in the one time international humanitarian musical event &quot;Loving the Silent Tears&quot; with performers from 16 countries and cultures, created by Al Kasha, directed by Vincent Paterson and choreographed by Bonnie Story at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles

<text>Claude Charles Bloch (July 12, 1878 – October 4, 1967) was a United States Navy admiral who served as Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Fleet (COMBATFOR) from 1937 to 1938; and Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet (CINCUS) from 1938 to 1940.

==Early years==
Claude C. Bloch was born on July 12, 1878, in Woodbury, Kentucky, to a Jewish family. He went to Ogden College. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1895 from the Third Congressional District in Kentucky.

While he was still a cadet, Bloch served aboard battleship during the battle of Santiago de Cuba. Bloch assisted in the rescue of Spanish sailors from the burning enemy ships and was subsequently awarded with the Specially Meritorious Service Medal.

He graduated from the Naval Academy on January 28, 1899, with the rank of passed midshipman.

He commanded during World War I and the from 1927 to 1929.

===Navy Cross citation===
The official U.S. Navy citation for Bloch&#x27;s Navy Cross reads:

:Name: Claude Charles Bloch
:Service: Navy
:Rank: Captain
:Company: Commanding Officer
:Division: U.S.S. Plattsburg 
:Citation: &quot;The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Captain Claude Charles Bloch, United States Navy, for distinguished service in the line of his profession as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. PLATTSBURG, engaged in the important, exacting and hazardous duty of transporting and escorting troops and supplies to European ports through waters infested with enemy submarines and mines during World War I.&quot;

==World War II==
He served as the Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet from 1938 to January 6, 1940, as was customary holding the temporary grade of admiral. Following this assignment, he reverted to his permanent grade, rear admiral, and commanded the Fourteenth Naval District at Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack. Shortly before the attack, he and Admiral Husband E. Kimmel discussed the possibly sighting and sinking of a submarine by the . The two ordered that another ship be sent to investigate. Bloch was cleared of any responsibility for the unpreparedness of the US forces during the attack which was blamed on Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter Short and Bloch remained as commandant until April 1942.

He later served on the General Board of the Navy from 1942, retiring from the Navy later that year with the rank of admiral. He remained as chairman of the Navy Board for productions awards until the end of World War II and retired in 1946. Bloch was decorated with a Legion of Merit for his World War II service.

He died in Washington, D.C., on October 4, 1967, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Bloch was the highest ranking Jewish officer in the armed forces until well after World War II.

The Guardian hailed it as &quot;the most life-enhancing production of Shakespeare&#x27;s play since Peter Brook&#x27;s.&quot;

In 2008 Supple started work on a new theatrical adaptation of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; with the celebrated Lebanese author Hanan al Shaykh. Commissioned by Luminato Festival, Toronto, and produced by Dash Arts, the production was developed over two years of research and rehearsal in North Africa and the Middle East. Created with a cast and creative team drawn from the Arabic speaking world and performed in three languages over six hours, One Thousand and One Nights opened in June 2011 in Toronto and had its European premier at Edinburgh International Festival in August where the Independent hailed it as &quot;an instant classic of engaged storytelling… a rediscovered literary masterpiece&quot;.

<doc id="1224837" wikidata="Q542406" url="?curid=1224837" title="Piero Fassino">
<text>Piero Franco Rodolfo Fassino (born 7 October 1949) is an Italian politician. He was Mayor of Turin from 2011 until 2016.

==Early life and education==
Fassino was born in Avigliana, Piedmont (province of Turin), in a traditional socialist family. His father Eugenio was a partisan, commander of the 41st Garibaldi Brigade, and his paternal grandfather Piero was beaten to death by the Italian Fascists in 1944 because he did not want to reveal his son&#x27;s hideout, while his maternal grandfather Cesare Grisa was one of the founders of the Italian Socialist Party. He graduated in Political Sciences.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Fassino registered with the Italian Communist Youth Federation of Turin in 1968. In 1975, he was elected as a Member of the City Council of the Piedmont regional capital, a position he remained in for ten years. From 1985 to 1990 he was Provincial Councillor, also in Turin. He was also secretary of the provincial Italian Communist Party (PCI) federation of Turin from 1983 to 1987, when he was elected as a member of the National Secretary&#x27;s Office of the party, first as the Secretary&#x27;s Office Coordinator, then as Responsible of Organization, during the period where the party was transformed from the PCI into the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS).

From 1991 to 1996, Fassino was International Secretary of the new party; in 1994 he was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies. Re-elected in 1996, he was appointed in 1998 as Minister for Foreign Commerce in the government headed by Massimo D&#x27;Alema. Between 2000 and 2001 he was Minister of Justice in the Giuliano Amato government. Candidate as vice-premier of The Olive Tree coalition in a ticket with former Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli for the 2001 general elections in Italy won by the House of Freedoms rival coalition, he was still re-elected as a Member of Parliament.

In addition to his role in Parliament, Fassino was a member of Italian delegation to the Assembly of the Western European Union from 2006 until 2011, where he served as chairman of the Committee on Political Affairs and as rapporteur for the Western Balkans.

From 2007 until 2010, Fassino served as the European Union&#x27;s special envoy for Myanmar, appointed by the Union’s High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana.

=== Secretary of Democrats of the Left ===
In 2001, during the National Party Congress of the Democrats of the Left, Fassino was elected as secretary (a position of leader in Italian political parties). He was then re-elected in February 2005, during the party congress.

In 2003, Fassino and other high-ranking party members – including Romano Prodi, Lamberto Dini and Walter Veltroni – were accused of taking millions of pounds in backhanders when state-run Telecom Italia bought a 29% stake in Telekom Serbia in 1997. During his time in office, Fassino asserted that &quot;Il Giornale&quot;, a right-wing newspaper, published confidential wiretap transcripts shortly before the 2006 election to create the impression that he had exercised improper pressure in the attempted takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by insurer Unipol in 2005. In 2013, a court awarded 80,000 euros in damages to Fassino for the incident.

=== Mayor of Turin ===
Fassino served as Mayor of Turin from 2011 until 2016. In the 2016 elections, he was defeated by Chiara Appendino, who overturned an 11-point gap after the first round to win 55 per cent of the vote.

=== Back to the Parliament ===
Fassino has been serving as a member of the Italian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe since 2018. As member of the Democratic Party, he is part of the Socialists, Democrats and Greens Group. In the Assembly, he serves on the Committee on the Honouring of Obligations and Commitments by Member States of the Council of Europe (since 2018); the Committee on Political Affairs and Democracy (since 2018); and the Sub-Committee on the Middle East and the Arab World (since 2019). He also serves as the Assembly&#x27;s co-rapporteur on Serbia (alongside Ian Liddell-Grainger) and Libya.

==Recognition==
Fassino received the &quot;America Award&quot; from the Italy-USA Foundation in 2010.

==Other activities==
* European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), Member of the Council
* Italy-USA Foundation, Member (since 2018)

==Personal life==
Fassino is married to Anna Maria Serafini, who was elected to the Italian Senate in 2006. He considers himself Roman Catholic.

<doc id="1224838" wikidata="Q3716270" url="?curid=1224838" title="Dungur">
<text>Dungur (or Dungur &#x27;Addi Kilte) is the ruins of a substantial mansion in Aksum, Ethiopia, the former capital city of the Kingdom of Aksum. The ruins are in the western part of Aksum, across the road from the Gudit stelae field.

==Description==

The remains of the mansion and its associated building are limited to the lowest levels and the podium, covering about 3,250 square meters. During its prime, a double staircase led into the entrance of the complex, which opened into one of the courtyards surrounding the central structure.

In the associated buildings a number of stone piers were recovered, &quot;presumably for supporting wooden columns or floors&quot;, and brickwork which might be evidence of a hypocaust. However, the purpose of these buildings is unclear. Stuart Munro-Hay notes, &quot;The &#x27;rooms&#x27; with stone piers have no doorways, and the piers presumably supported floors, but occasional divisions on the same level do have doorways, implying that not all the lower level was merely a podium for a higher floor level. Possibly some rooms were entered from within by ladders.&quot;

==Archaeology==

S. Puglisi performed the first archaeological excavation in this area, excavating a 3 x 5 meter sondage with the intent of revealing its stratification. The next excavations in this area were conducted in 1966–1968 by Francis Anfray, who uncovered a dwelling 250 meters west of Puglisi&#x27;s trench that he described as a &quot;château&quot;, inhabited by one of the city&#x27;s elite. Based on the evidence from these excavations, Butzer dated Anfray&#x27;s dwelling to the seventh century; he pointed out that the masonry was similar to the base of St Mary of Zion church (which is part of the original structure that dated from Axumite times), while the floor plan was similar to the layout of the central block of the Ta&#x27;akha Maryam palace.

On records, the band was sometimes billed under alternate names such as Fred Wesley and the JBs, The James Brown Soul Train, Maceo and the Macks, A.A.B.B., Fred Wesley and the New JBs, The First Family, and The Last Word. In addition to backing Brown, the J.B.&#x27;s played behind Bobby Byrd, Lyn Collins, and other singers associated with the James Brown Revue, and performed and recorded as a self-contained group. In 2015, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but failed to be inducted and can be considered for Musical Excellence in the future. They have been eligible since 1995.

==Career==
===The &quot;original&quot; J.B.&#x27;s===
The J.B.&#x27;s were formed in March 1970 after most of the members of Brown&#x27;s previous band walked out on him over a pay dispute. (Brown&#x27;s previous bands of the 1950s and 1960s had been known as The James Brown Band and The James Brown Orchestra.) The J.B.&#x27;s initial lineup included bassist William &quot;Bootsy&quot; Collins and his brother, guitarist Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins, formerly of the obscure funk band The Pacemakers; Bobby Byrd (founder of the original Famous Flames singing group) (organ), and John &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks (drums), both holdovers from Brown&#x27;s 1960s band; three inexperienced horn players, Clayton &quot;Chicken&quot; Gunnells, Darryl &quot;Hasaan&quot; Jamison, and Robert McCollough; and conga player Johnny Griggs. This version of the J.B.&#x27;s played on some of Brown&#x27;s most intense funk recordings, including &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot;, &quot;Super Bad&quot;, &quot;Soul Power&quot;, and &quot;Talkin&#x27; Loud and Sayin&#x27; Nothing&quot;. They also accompanied Brown on a European tour (during which they recorded the long-delayed live album &quot;Love Power Peace&quot;), performed on the &quot;Sex Machine&quot; double LP, and released two instrumental singles, the much-sampled &quot;The Grunt&quot; and &quot;These Are the J.B.&#x27;s&quot;.

===Later configurations===
In December 1970, trombonist Fred Wesley rejoined James Brown&#x27;s organization to lead the J.B.&#x27;s. Other former Brown sidemen, including Maceo Parker and St. Clair Pinckney, eventually followed his lead, while the Collins brothers and most of the rest of the &quot;original&quot; J.B.&#x27;s left Brown to join George Clinton&#x27;s Parliament-Funkadelic collective. Wesley and Parker left in 1975. Brown continued to bill his backing band as the J.B.&#x27;s into the mid-1980s, when he changed their name to the Soul Generals, or Soul G&#x27;s.

===Recordings===
In addition to backing Brown on stage and on record during this era, the J.B.&#x27;s also recorded albums and singles on their own, sometimes with Brown performing on organ or synthesizer. Their albums were generally a mixture of heavy funk tracks and some more jazz-oriented pieces. Nearly all of the J.B.&#x27;s recordings were produced by Brown, and most were released on his own label, People Records. The band scored a number of chart hits in the early 1970s, including &quot;Pass the Peas&quot;, &quot;Gimme Some More&quot;, and the #1 R&amp;B hit, &quot;Doing It to Death&quot;. Credited to &quot;Fred Wesley &amp; the J.B.&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Doing It to Death&quot; sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in July 1973.

Some of the J.B.&#x27;s releases have unusual characteristics. The 1974 album &quot;Breakin&#x27; Bread&quot; is unique in that most of the songs have a Fred Wesley spoken reminiscence dubbed onto the beginning of the song, each time over a canned backing track. It is in sharp contrast to James Brown&#x27;s real-time dominance of the proceedings on the classic &quot;Doing It to Death&quot; LP. A similar oddity is encountered on the other 1974 album, &quot;Damn Right I Am Somebody&quot;, where that album have been spliced onto the beginnings of most of the other songs. Under the name A.A.B.B., the group released a single, &quot;Pick up the Pieces One by One&quot;, which reached #108 on the U.S. chart in 1975. Both the song and the name—which stood for &quot;Above Average Black Band&quot;—were a tribute to and tongue-in-cheek reply to the then-popular Scottish funk group the Average White Band (also known as AWB) and its #1 hit single &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot;. The J.B.&#x27;s final single for Brown&#x27;s People label, 1976&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Wanna Get Funky One More Time&quot;, features a rare hornless arrangement.

As funk music gave way in popularity to disco in the 1970s, the group&#x27;s material and arrangements changed accordingly, but their chart success declined along with Brown&#x27;s own.

Like most of James Brown&#x27;s music, the recorded output of the J.B.&#x27;s has been heavily mined for samples by hip hop DJs and record producers.

===The JB Horns===
During the 1980s and 1990s, Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley intermittently toured under the name The JB Horns, sometimes with other former Brown sidemen such as Alfred &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis. The JB Horns recorded several albums for the Gramavision label, which were later reissued by Rhino Records. They also recorded an album under this name with producer Richard Mazda called &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;.

The JB Horns are also associated with The Horny Horns, staple members of P-Funk and Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, which was led by Fred Wesley and included Maceo, as well as Rick Gardner and Richard &quot;Kush&quot; Griffith on trumpets.

===Reunion===
A version of the J.B.&#x27;s including Fred Wesley, Bootsy Collins, Pee Wee Ellis, Bobby Byrd, and Clyde Stubblefield assembled to record the 1999 &quot;reunion&quot; album &quot;Bring the Funk on Down&quot;, dedicated to the memory of St. Clair Pinckney. The album was released in Japan by P-Vine Records, and in 2002 it was reissued in the U.S. by Instinct Records.

A reunion of the original J.B.&#x27;s rhythm section, with Bootsy and Phelps Collins, Clyde Stubblefield, and Jabo Starks, and supplemented by Bernie Worrell, recorded the &quot;Superbad&quot; movie soundtrack. They went on to perform the first tribute concert remembering James Brown.

<text>Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo &quot;Vopiscus&quot; (c. 131 – 87 BC) was the younger son of Lucius Julius Caesar and his wife Popillia, and younger brother of Lucius Julius Caesar, consul in 90 BC. His cognomen &#x27;Strabo&#x27; indicates he was possibly cross-eyed, and the nickname &#x27;Vopiscus&#x27; suggests he was a surviving member of a set of twins.

In 103 BC, he was on a committee to supervise the implementation of the &quot;Lex frumentaria&quot;, an agrarian bill, proposed by tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus. Strabo became a pontifex in 99 BC; a quaestor in 96 BC and an aedile in 90 BC.

In the midst of the Social War, Strabo stood for the consulship even though he had not yet been praetor. His candidacy was rejected by tribunes Publius Sulpicius Rufus and Publius Antistius, which led to street clashes in December 89 BC. After Strabo was dismissed Sulla and Quintus Pompeius Rufus were elected consuls for 88 BC. 

Along with his brother he was killed in the streets by partisans of Marius following the civil war in 87 BC. According to Livy, their heads were exposed on the speaker&#x27;s platform.

Caesar Strabo Vopiscus wrote at least three tragedies with Greek themes. These plays were &quot;Adrastus&quot;, &quot;Tecmesa&quot; and &quot;Teutras&quot;. Only fragments of the plays survive. According to Cicero, he was an orator known for his wit and humour. Cicero published a dialogue called &quot;De Oratore&quot;, in which Strabo explains why humour is important in speech.

He was an uncle to Lucius Julius Caesar (consul in 64 BC), Julia, and a great-uncle to Mark Antony.

<text>Online help is topic-oriented, procedural or reference information delivered through computer software. It is a form of user assistance. The purpose of most online help is to assist in using a software application, web application or operating system. However, it can also present information on a broad range of subjects. Online help linked to the application&#x27;s state (what the user is doing) is called Context-sensitive help.

==Benefits==
Online help has largely replaced live customer support. Before its availability, support could only be given through printed documentation, postal mail, telephone, or in person

==Platforms==

Online help is created using help authoring tools or component content management systems. It is delivered in a wide variety of formats, some proprietary and some open-standard, including:
*Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which includes HTML Help, HTML-based Help, JavaHelp, and Oracle Help
*Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)

Online help is also provided via live chat systems, one step removed from telephone calls. This allows the support person to conduct several support sessions simultaneously, thus reducing costs. The transcript is immediately available and can be sent to the customer after the session ends.

===Microsoft help platforms===
Microsoft develops the platforms for delivering help systems in the Microsoft Windows operating system.

<doc id="1224860" wikidata="Q18618" url="?curid=1224860" title="Deliverance (Opeth album)">
<text>Deliverance is the sixth studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. It was released on 12 November 2002. It was recorded between 22 July and 4 September 2002, at the same time as &quot;Damnation&quot;, which was released five months after this album. The two albums contrast starkly with one another, purposely dividing the band&#x27;s two most prevalent styles, as &quot;Deliverance&quot; is considered to be one of the band&#x27;s heaviest albums, taking on a heavier and more brutal death metal-inspired sound, whereas &quot;Damnation&quot; experiments with a much mellower progressive rock-influenced sound.

==Background==

The band originally intended for &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; to be released as a double album, but the record company eventually decided against this and released them separately, approximately five months apart from one another in order to promote them properly. The recording sessions also became a writing session of two albums worth of material, causing the recordings to be long as there were no songs written prior to that point. Åkerfeldt wrote the songs in the night and recorded them with the band during the days.

The track &quot;Master&#x27;s Apprentices&quot; was named after the Australian hard/progressive rock group The Masters Apprentices. &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; was named after a song on the album &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; by progressive rock group Genesis.

At the end of &quot;By the Pain I See in Others&quot;, the final note fades slowly and ends at 10:40. Silence follows until 12:00, followed by two backmasked verses from &quot;Master&#x27;s Apprentices&quot; at 12:00 and 13:15.

==Production==

The recording for &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; was fraught with troubles. The band had originally started recording the album in Nacksving Studio, but the recording process was plagued, not just by a variety of technical issues ranging from equipment breaking down to drum mics changing positions or disappearing, but also internal band issues. Eventually, the band would return to Studio Fredman (upon which they would be joined by producer Steven Wilson) to finish off the record.

During the recording process, Mikael Åkerfeldt&#x27;s grandmother was killed in a car accident. He would later dedicate both &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Damnation&quot; to her.

==Reception==
&quot;Deliverance&quot; peaked on Top Heatseekers at No. 16 and the Top Independent Albums chart at No. 19, making it the first Opeth release ever to chart. Opeth also won a Grammis Award for Best Hard Rock Performance after releasing the album.

The album appeared on several lists of the best albums of 2002, including that of &quot;Kerrang!,&quot; &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; and &quot;Terrorizer&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked &quot;Deliverance&quot; as the third best album of 2002. In March 2023, Rolling Stone ranked the title track number fifty-two on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot;

<doc id="1224878" wikidata="Q7893515" url="?curid=1224878" title="United States v. Washington">
<text>United States v. Washington, 384 F. Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), aff&#x27;d, 520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1975), commonly known as the Boldt Decision (from the name of the trial court judge, George Hugo Boldt), was a legal case in 1974 heard in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The case re-affirmed the rights of American Indian tribes in the state of Washington to co-manage and continue to harvest salmon and other fish under the terms of various treaties with the U.S. government. The tribes ceded their land to the United States but reserved the right to fish as they always had. This included their traditional locations off the designated reservations.

As the time went by, the State of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the tribes despite losing a series of court cases on the issue. Those cases provided the Indian tribal members a right of access through private property to their fishing locations, and said that the state could neither charge the Indians a fee to fish nor discriminate against the tribes in the method of fishing allowed. Those cases also provided for the Indian tribes rights to a fair and equitable share of the harvest. The Boldt decision further defined that reserved right, holding that the tribes were entitled to half the fish harvest each year.

In 1975, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge Boldt&#x27;s ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. After the state refused to enforce the court order, Judge Boldt ordered the United States Coast Guard and federal law enforcement agencies to enforce his rulings. On July 2, 1979, the Supreme Court rejected a collateral attack on the case, largely endorsing Judge Boldt&#x27;s ruling and the opinion of the Ninth Circuit. In &quot;Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass&#x27;n&quot;, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that &quot;[b]oth sides have a right, secured by treaty, to take a fair share of the available fish.&quot; The Supreme Court also endorsed Boldt&#x27;s orders to enforce his rulings using federal law enforcement assets and the Coast Guard.

==Background==

===History of tribal fishing===
The American Indians of the Pacific Northwest had long depended on the salmon harvest, a resource that allowed them to become among the wealthiest North American tribes. The salmon harvest for the Columbia River basin was estimated at annually, which provided sufficient salmon not only for the tribes&#x27; needs but also to trade with others. By the 1840s, tribes were trading salmon to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which shipped the fish to New York, Great Britain, and other locations around the world.

===Treaties===

In the 1850s, the US government entered into a series of treaties with the American Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest. In the Treaty of Olympia, Territorial Governor Isaac I. Stevens agreed that the tribes had rights, including:

Other agreements with area tribes included the treaties of Medicine Creek, Point Elliott, Neah Bay, and Point No Point. All of them had similar language on the rights of the tribes to fish outside the reservation. While the tribes agreed to part with their land, they insisted on protecting their fishing rights throughout the Washington Territory.

===Post-treaty history===
Initially, the federal government honored its treaties with the tribes, but with increasing numbers of white settlers moving into the area, the settlers began to infringe upon the fishing rights of the native tribes. By 1883, whites had established more than forty salmon canneries. In 1894, there were three canneries in the Puget Sound area; by 1905, there were twenty-four. The whites also began to use new techniques, which prevented a significant portion of the salmon from reaching the tribal fishing areas. When Washington Territory became a state in 1889, the legislature passed &quot;laws to curtail tribal fishing in the name of &#x27;conservation&#x27; but what some scholars described as being designed to protect white fisheries.&quot; The state legislature, by 1897, had banned the use of weirs, which were customarily used by Indians fishermen. The tribes turned to the courts for enforcement of their rights under the treaties.

====&quot;United States v. Taylor&quot;====
In one of the earliest of the enforcement cases, decided in 1887, the United States Indian agent and several members of the Yakama tribe filed suit in territorial court to enforce their right of access to off-reservation fishing locations. Frank Taylor, a non-Indian settler, had obtained land from the United States and had fenced off the land, preventing access by the Yakama to their traditional fishing locations. 
Although the trial court ruled in Taylor&#x27;s favor, the Supreme Court of the Territory of Washington reversed and held that the tribe had reserved its own rights to fish, thereby creating an easement or an equitable servitude of the land that was not extinguished when Taylor obtained title.

====&quot;United States v. Winans&quot;====
Within ten years, another case arose, which dealt with fishing rights at Celilo Falls, a traditional Indian fishing location. Two brothers, Lineas and Audubon Winans, owned property on both sides of the Columbia River and obtained licenses from the State of Washington to operate four fish wheels. The wheels prevented a significant number of salmon from passing the location. Additionally, the Winans prohibited anyone, whether an Indian with treaty rights or otherwise, from crossing their land to get to the falls.

The United States Attorney for Washington then filed a suit to enforce the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial court held that the property rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision by holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.

====&quot;Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States&quot;====
In 1914, the United States sued again, this time against the Seufert Brothers Company, which had prevented Yakama Indians including Sam Williams from fishing on the Oregon side of the Columbia River near the Celilo Falls. After the United States sued on behalf of Williams, the United States District Court in Oregon issued an injunction which the Supreme Court affirmed, again holding that the treaties created a servitude that ran with the land. The decision was significant in that it expanded the hunting and fishing rights outside the territory ceded by the tribes when it was shown that the tribe had used the area for hunting and fishing.

===State attempts to regulate Indian tribes fishing===

====&quot;Tulee v. Washington&quot;====

In &quot;Tulee v. Washington&quot;, the United States Supreme Court once again ruled on the treaty rights of the Yakama tribe. In 1939, Sampson Tulee, a Yakama, was arrested for fishing without a state fishing license. The United States government immediately filed for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; on Tulee&#x27;s behalf, which was denied on procedural grounds because he had not yet been tried in state court and had not exhausted his appeals. Tulee was convicted in state court, which was upheld by the Washington Supreme Court on the grounds that the state&#x27;s sovereignty allowed it to impose a fee on Indians who were fishing outside the reservation. The United States Supreme Court reversed, stating &quot;we are of the opinion that the state is without power to charge the Yakamas a fee for fishing&quot;.

====Puyallup cases====
Following the &quot;Tulee&quot; decision, there were three United States Supreme Court decisions involving the Puyallup tribe. The first was &quot;Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Washington,&quot; (&quot;Puyallup I&quot;) which involved a state ban on the use of nets to catch steelhead trout and salmon. Despite the ban, the tribes continued to use nets based on their treaty rights. Justice William Douglas delivered the opinion of the court which said that the treaty did not prevent state regulations that were reasonable and necessary under a fish conservation scheme, provided the regulation was not discriminatory.

After being remanded to determine if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe&quot; (&quot;Puyallyp II&quot;). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the tribes, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-tribal people. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.

The third case, &quot;Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington&quot; (&quot;Puyallup III&quot;), was decided in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing for a majority of the court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe&#x27;s sovereign immunity, the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as the state could base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.

====The Belloni decision====
One year after the &quot;Puyallup I&quot; decision, Judge Robert C. Belloni issued an order in &quot;Sohappy v. Smith&quot;, a treaty fishing case involving the Yakama tribe and the state of Oregon. In this case, Oregon had discriminated against the Indian peoples in favor of sports and commercial fishermen, allocating almost nothing to the tribes at the headwaters of the river. Oregon argued that the treaties only gave the Indians the same rights as every other citizen, and Belloni noted that &quot;[s]uch a reading would not seem unreasonable if all history, anthropology, biology, prior case law and the intention of the parties to the treaty were to be ignored&quot;. Belloni also found that:

Belloni issued a final ruling that the tribes were entitled to a fair and equitable portion of the fish harvest. The court retained continuing jurisdiction, and his order was not appealed.

==U.S. District Court (Boldt decision)==
===Issue===
Although the Belloni decision established the rights of the Indian tribes to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the States of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest tribal members for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakama tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the State of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.

===Trial===
The first phase of the case took three years, mainly in preparation for trial. During the trial, Boldt heard testimony from about 50 witnesses and admitted 350 exhibits. The evidence showed that the state had shut down many sites used by Indians for net fishing but allowed commercial net fishing elsewhere on the same run. At most, the tribes took only about 2% of the total harvest. There was no evidence presented by the state that showed any detrimental actions by the tribes toward the harvest. Both expert testimony and cultural testimony was presented, with tribal members relating the oral history dealing with the treaties and fishing rights. Additionally, Boldt found that the tribe&#x27;s witnesses were more credible than those of the state and that the tribe&#x27;s expert witnesses were &quot;exceptionally well researched.&quot;

===Holding===

The court held that when the tribes conveyed millions of acres of land in Washington State through a series of treaties signed in 1854 and 1855, they reserved the right to continue fishing. The court looked at the minutes of the treaty negotiations to interpret the meaning of the treaty language &quot;in common with&quot; as the United States described it to the tribes, holding that the United States intended for there to be an equal sharing of the fish resource between the tribes and the settlers. As the court stated, the phrase means &quot;sharing equally the opportunity to take fish... therefore, nontreaty fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to 50% of the harvestable number of fish... and treaty right fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to the same percentage.&quot; The formula used by Boldt gave the tribes 43% of the Puget Sound harvest, which was equivalent to 18% of the statewide harvest. The order required the state to limit the amount of fish taken by non-Indian commercial fishermen, causing a drop in their income from about $15,000–20,000 to $500–2000.

Furthermore, the court also held the state could regulate the Indian tribes&#x27; exercise of their treaty rights but only to ensure the &quot;perpetuation of a run or of a species of fish.&quot; To regulate the tribes, the state must be able to show that conservation could not be achieved by regulating only the non-Indians, must not discriminate against the tribes, and must use appropriate due process.

==Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals==

===Opinion of the court===
After the District Court issued its ruling, both sides submitted appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Washington argued that the district court had no power to invalidate state fishing regulations, but the tribes argued that &quot;the state may not regulate their fishing activities at treaty locations for any reason.&quot; Writing for a majority of the court, Circuit Court Judge Herbert Choy affirmed Judge Boldt&#x27;s opinion &quot;in all respects&quot; but clarified that Judge Boldt&#x27;s &quot;equitable apportionment&quot; of harvestable fish did not apply to &quot;fish caught by non-Washington citizens outside the state&#x27;s jurisdiction.&quot;

In his majority opinion, Judge Choy emphasized that states may not enact regulations that are &quot;in conflict with treaties in force between the United States and the Indian nations.&quot; Consequently, he concluded that the treaties signed in the 1850s expressly preempted Washington&#x27;s regulations and that non-Indian people had &quot;only a limited right to fish at treaty places.&quot; Judge Choy also emphasized that the tribes were &quot;entitled to an equitable apportionment of the opportunity to fish in order to safeguard their federal treaty rights&quot; and that the Ninth Circuit should grant the district court a &quot;great amount of discretion as a court of equity&quot; when apportioning rights to fisheries. He held that the district court&#x27;s apportionment &quot;was well within its discretion&quot; but clarified that tribes were not entitled to compensation for &quot;unanticipated heavy fishing&quot; that occurred off Washington&#x27;s coast. Judge Choy also clarified that the district court&#x27;s equitable remedy should attempt to minimize hardships for white reef net fishermen.

===Concurrence===
District court judge James M. Burns, sitting by designation, wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he criticized the &quot;recalcitrance of Washington State officials&quot; in their management of the state&#x27;s fisheries. Judge Burns argued that Washington&#x27;s recalcitrance forced Judge Boldt to act as &quot;perpetual fishmaster&quot; and noted that he &quot;deplore[d]&quot; situations in which district court judges are forced to act as &quot;enduring managers of the fisheries, forests, and highways.&quot; In his concluding remarks, Judge Burns argued that Washington&#x27;s responsibility to manage its natural resources &quot;should neither escape notice nor be forgotten.&quot;

===Certiorari denied===
After the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling in the direct appeal, the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. Washington submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied the state&#x27;s petition for certiorari and subsequent petition for rehearing. Despite the rulings, the parties in the original case continued to litigate issues relating to apportionment of the fisheries and subsequent rulings have been issued as recently as May 2015.

==Subsequent developments==

===Legal===

====Collateral attacks====
After Boldt&#x27;s decision, the Washington Department of Fisheries issued new regulations in compliance with the decision. The Puget Sound Gillnetters Association and the Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association both filed lawsuits in state court to block the new regulations. These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington Supreme Court. Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the State of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States Supreme Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot; and vacated the decision of the Washington Supreme Court.

Justice John Paul Stevens announced the decision of the court, which upheld Judge Boldt&#x27;s order and overturned the rulings of the state courts. Stevens explicitly stated that Boldt could issue the orders that he did: &quot;[t]he federal court unquestionably has the power to enter the various orders that state official and private parties have chosen to ignore, and even to displace local enforcement of those orders if necessary to remedy the violations of federal law found by the court.&quot;

====Court supervision====
When the state would not enforce his order to reduce the catch of non-Indian commercial fishermen, Boldt took direct action by placing the matter under federal supervision. The United States Coast Guard and the National Marine Fisheries Service were ordered to enforce the ruling and soon had boats in the water confronting violators. Some of the protesters rammed Coast Guard boats, and at least one member of the Coast Guard was shot. Those whom the officers caught breaking the court&#x27;s orders were taken before federal magistrates and fined for contempt, and the illegal fishing as a protest stopped. The United States District Court continued to exercise continuing jurisdiction over the matter, determining traditional fishing locations and compiling major orders of the court.

====Phase II====
The case continued to have issues brought up before the district court. In what became known as &quot;Phase II&quot;, District Judge William H. Orrick, Jr. heard the issues presented by the United States on behalf of the tribes. Following the hearing, Orrick enjoined the State of Washington from damaging the fish&#x27;s habitat and included hatchery-raised fish in the allocation to the Indian tribes. The state appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed in part and reversed in part, allowing the hatchery fish to remain in the allocation but leaving the habitat issue open.

====Culvert case subproceeding====
In 2001, 21 northwestern Washington tribes, joined by the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court to find that the state has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a &quot;moderate living&quot; and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding anadromous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction, ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of anadromous fish by 2030.

The State of Washington appealed the district court&#x27;s decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 27, 2016, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court&#x27;s decision and upheld the injunction. Washington State has estimated it will need to fix an average of 30 to 40 culverts a year to comply with the injunction.

===Public response===
Scholars consider the Boldt decision to be a landmark case in American Indian law, in the area of co-operative management of resources, for Indian treaty rights, internationally for aboriginal treaty rights, and tribal civil rights.

The decision caused an immediate negative reaction from some citizens of Washington. Bumper stickers reading &quot;Can Judge Boldt, Not Salmon&quot; appeared, and Boldt was hanged in effigy at the federal courthouse. Non-Indian commercial fishermen ignored the ruling, and the state was reluctant or at times refused to enforce the law. By 1978, Representative John E. Cunningham tried to get a bill passed to abrogate the treaties, to break up Indian tribal holdings, and stop giving the tribes &quot;special consideration&quot;, but the effort failed. In 1984, Washington voters passed an initiative ending &quot;special rights&quot; for Indians, but the state refused to enforce it as being pre-empted by federal law.

&quot;United States v. Washington&quot; was a landmark case in terms of Native American civil rights and evoked strong emotions. According to former U.S. Representative Lloyd Meeds of Everett, &quot;the fishing issue was to Washington state what busing was to the East&quot; for African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement.

===Tribal developments===
The tribes involved benefited greatly from the decision. Prior to Boldt&#x27;s ruling, Indian tribes collected less than 5% of the harvest, but by 1984, they were collecting 49%. Tribal members became successful commercial fishermen, even expanding to marine fishing as far away as Alaska. The tribes became co-managers of the fisheries along with the state, hiring fish biologists and staff to carry out those duties. The Makah tribe, based on the terms of the Neah Bay Treaty and the Boldt decision, took their first California gray whale in over 70 years in 1999. Following a lawsuit by various animal rights activists, the tribe was allocated the right to take up to five whales a year for the 2001 and 2002 seasons.

<text>Alcide &quot;Blind Uncle&quot; Gaspard was a partially blind vocalist and guitarist from Louisiana who alternated between string-band music (in a band with his brothers) and traditional Cajun balladry on his recordings for Vocalion. Born in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana in 1878 of Acadian descent, he became partially blinded when he was seven. It is unknown how Gaspard became blinded in one eye. 

Very little is known about Gaspard and his life as a musician; even among big-time Cajun musicians and fans. A brilliant, dexterous guitarist and songwriter, he is often regarded in Cajun and Americana music circles as a very mysterious and unacclaimed figure. His influences remain unknown, although his family is believed to have brought him into music. Gaspard formed his first band with his brothers Victor and Amade. When he began recording in the late 1920s it was mainly as a backing guitarist for fiddler Delma Lachney (1896) also from Avoyelles Parish of French-Canadian descent. It was then that he also recorded some solo selections of his own during these sessions. None of Gaspard&#x27;s original recordings are believed to have sold over 100 copies within his lifetime. 

Gaspard suffered from deep depression and isolation throughout his life, and it is believed he remained a bachelor until his untimely death. Gaspard reportedly died untimely and alone in 1937. He was believed to be in good-health during the time of his premature passing. His sudden cause of death remains unknown. Gaspard is buried at Mater Dolorosa Catholic Cemetery, in Plaucheville, Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana.
Many of Gaspard&#x27;s rare recordings were re-released on Cajun compilations into the millennium. He has since recently retained a small cult-following. One of Gaspard&#x27;s select songs &quot;Sur Le Borde De L&#x27;eau&quot; was recently featured on the 2014 soundtrack of the HBO television series &quot;True Detective&quot;, bringing Gaspard&#x27;s musical endeavors into the mainstream public for the first time. Music journalist Amanda Petrusich discusses the song in her book about collecting 78 rpm records, &quot;Do Not Sell At Any Price&quot;. The song was among those featured in a 2015 interview with Petrusich on the NPR program, &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. Interest in Gaspard and his unsung music career have grown in significant popularity since the recent rediscovery of his music.

<doc id="1224896" wikidata="Q2059559" url="?curid=1224896" title="Mary Kornman">
<text>Mary Kornman (born Mary Agnes Evans, December 27, 1915 – June 1, 1973) was an American child actress who was the leading female star of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series during the Pathé silent era.

==&quot;Our Gang&quot;==
She was born as Mary Agnes Evans, and was the daughter of Verna Comer, who appeared in several films, and David Lionel Evans. Her stepfather, Hal Roach′s still-photo cameraman Eugene Kornman, adopted Mary after he and Mary&#x27;s mother were married in 1921. After Peggy Cartwright, who appeared in only four or five &quot;Our Gang&quot; episodes, Mary became the leading lady of the series, appearing in more than 40 episodes. Kornman was one of the series′ biggest stars during its early years between 1922 and 1926. After outgrowing the Our Gang series, she and fellow Our Gang alumnus Scooter Lowry spent a couple of years performing as a vaudeville duo. They were later joined by Johnny Downs, who played Kornman&#x27;s love interest.

==Mildred Kornman==
Her younger sister, Mildred, was also a child actress. When asked in 1960 what she thought of being part of &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Mildred Kornman replied &quot;It was fun being a gang member. It was play. I have no regrets...We didn&#x27;t have to be talented, which is natural for kids ... I think we had a privileged childhood working in those films.&quot;

==Later years and death==
Mary continued working with &quot;Our Gang&quot; co-star Mickey Daniels into adulthood, as evidenced by some publicity shots from the era. She appeared with Mickey in the teen version of Our Gang, &quot;The Boy Friends&quot;. In 1934, she married Leo Tover, a cameraman, but divorced approximately five years later. 

Throughout the 1930s, she continued to appear in many features such as the serial &quot;Queen of the Jungle&quot; (1935), and &quot;The Desert Trail&quot; (1935) starring John Wayne. She retired from the screen in 1940.

She later married Ralph B. McCutcheon, a horse trainer on some of her Western films. Mary spent the rest of her life devoted to him. They had no children. They both spent their remaining years on their ranch with the horses. She kept close with her Hollywood acquaintances and friends. When asked if Mary was as kind and genuine a person as she appeared to be onscreen, her sister Mildred replied, &quot;She was all of that and more.&quot; 

Mary became gravely ill in the early 1970s and was eventually diagnosed with cancer. She died on June 1, 1973, aged 57. Her widower died two years later. They are interred at Linn Grove Cemetery, Greeley, Colorado.

<text>Takapuna is a suburb located on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand. The suburb is an isthmus between Shoal Bay, arm of the Waitematā Harbour, and the Hauraki Gulf. Lake Pupuke, a volcanic maar and one of the oldest features of the Auckland volcanic field, is a freshwater lake located in the suburb.

Takapuna was settled by Tāmaki Māori in the 13th or 14th centuries, who utilised the resources of Lake Pupuke, and a pōhutukawa grove called . The grove still exists to this day and was an important location for funeral ceremonies. In 1847, the first European farmers settled at Takapuna, and the Crown gifted land at Takapuna to Ngāpuhi chief Eruera Maihi Patuone in order to create a protective barrier for Auckland. Jean-Baptiste Pompallier established St Mary&#x27;s College at Takapuna in 1849.

The area became a popular tourist destination for wealthy families of Auckland in the 1880s, when many large summer residences were being constructed on the shores of Lake Pupuke. By the early 20th century, Takapuna Beach had grown in importance for tourists. The suburb developed in the 1910s due to a private tramway, and by the 1930s gradually became a commercial centre for the North Shore. Takapuna grew in importance after the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959, becoming the administrative centre for the North Shore.

==Etymology==
The name Takapuna refers to a spring at Maungauika / North Head, located north of Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Devonport. The name was given by Hoturoa of the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka. When the waka stopped at Torpedo Bay, Hoturoa and the crew of the &quot;Tainui&quot; met the residents of the area and drank from the spring. Hoturoa named the spring in remembrance of a spring in his homeland of Hawaiki (Mangaia). While the word in Māori refers to natural springs, the meaning of in this context is unknown, and the name has variously been interpreted to mean &quot;Knoll Spring&quot;, &quot;Rock Spring&quot;, &quot;Cliff Spring&quot; or &quot;Falling Spring&quot;.

Over time, Tāmaki Māori began to refer to the wider area around Maungauika / North Head and the North Shore as Takapuna. Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, an early explorer, was the first European to adopt the name to describe the area north of North Head in 1833. During the early colonial era of Auckland, the name was used for the Parish of Takapuna, and modern Lake Pupuke was referred to as Lake Takapuna from the 1860s until the 1940s.

The area was known as the Lake District from 1866 until 1882, when the name Takapuna was formally adopted. The name Takapuna was gradually adopted to mean the settlement focused on the southern shores of Lake Pupuke over the 19th century. The areas to the south were known as Devonport, meaning Takapuna had become geographically separated from its namesake.

==Geology==


The North Shore is primarily uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone, that was deposited on the sea floor during the Early Miocene, between 22 and 16 million years ago. The Takapuna area is home to Lake Pupuke, a volcanic maar which is one of the oldest known features of the Auckland volcanic field, erupting an estimated 193,200 years ago. A small scoria cone existed to the west of Lake Pupuke, which was quarried during European settlement.

During the eruption of Lake Pupuke, two lava flows travelled eastwards through the area, burning vegetation and encasing the lower 1–2 metres of the tree trunks in lava. The lava solidified into basalt rock, creating the Takapuna Fossil Forest, which was exposed an estimated 7,000 years ago due to coastal erosion.

Prior to human settlement, pōhutukawa trees dominated the coastal margins of the North Shore. The inland North Shore was a mixed podocarp-broadleaf forest dominated by kauri. To the west of Takapuna is Smiths Bush in the Onewa Domain, a remnant native forest, dominated by kahikatea and taraire trees. By the 1850s, Takapuna was primarily a mānuka scrubland, with significant coastal areas dominated by harakeke.

==Geography==

Takapuna is an isthmus between the Hauraki Gulf and Shoal Bay, a long narrow bay of the Waitematā Harbour. Takapuna is surrounded by the suburbs of Hauraki to the south-east, Northcote to the south-west, Hillcrest and Wairau Valley to the west, and Milford north of Lake Pupuke. The highest point in the suburb is above sea-level, located at the Killarney Street and the Terrace.

Two beaches are located in the eastern parts of the suburb. Takapuna Beach is found to the south, which faces toward Rangitoto Island across the Rangitoto Channel. Further north along the coast is Thorne Bay, which features a rock formation called Black Rock, at the northern point of the bay.

Barrys Point is a headland in Takapuna south of Esmonde Road that extends into Shoal Bay.

==History==
===Māori history===
Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The Devonport-Takapuna area was one of the earliest settled in the region, known to be settled by the Tāmaki Māori ancestor Peretū. Toi-te-huatahi and his followers settled and interwed with these early peoples.

Around the year 1350, the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe visited the Takapuna area, stopping at the freshwater spring southwest of Maungauika / North Head. Some members of the crew decided to settle permanently in the area, including Taikehu, and intermarried with the people of the North Shore. Kāinga were found throughout the wider Takapuna area, protected by pā at Castor Bay (Te Rahopara o Peretū) to the north, with Takarunga / Mount Victoria and Maungauika / North Head to the south. Over time, the descendants of these people began to identify as Ngā Oho and Ngāi Tai.

The warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region, likely sometime in the 17th century. Maki conquered and unified many the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His younger son Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast, who based himself at the head of the Ōrewa River. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;). Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu.

In the 17th century, Ngāti Pāoa attacked the settlements around the Waitematā Harbour, later intermarrying with the Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāi Tai people of the southern North Shore. During intertribal war with Ngāpuhi, the pā at Maungauika / North Head was sieged in 1793, leading Ngāti Pāoa to refocus their settlements on Waiheke Island until the 1830s. During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of war parties during the Musket Wars.

====Lake Pupuke and Te Riri a Mataaho====

Lake Pupuke was an important location to Tāmaki Māori of the North Shore. It was used a source of fresh water, and its name (&quot;Overflowing Sea&quot;) referred to how the fresh water would habitually flow out from the lake to the sea. Eels and mussels were harvested from the lake, and birds who were attracted to the lake were snared for food, and harakeke from the shores could be harvested for textiles. The northern shores of the lake was home to a grove of karaka trees, which were likely used for both food and medicinal purposes.

Takapuna is part of the setting of (&quot;The Wrath of Mataaho&quot;), a Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki traditional story () that describes the creation of Lake Pupuke and &quot;The Twins&quot;, two rock formations on Takapuna Beach. Two tupua (children of the Fire God Mataaho), Matakamokamo and his wife Matakerepo, lived on Te Rua Maunga, a mountain located at Lake Pupuke. The couple argued over some flax clothing that Matakerepo had made for her husband, and the argument became so heated that the fire outside their dwelling died out. Matakamokamo cursed Mahuika, Goddess of the Fire, for allowing this to happen. Mahuika was furious at the couple, and asked Mataaho to punish them. Mataaho destroyed their mountain home, and in its place left Pupuke Moana (Lake Pupuke), while at the same time he formed the mountain Rangitoto. The couple fled to the newly formed island, where Mataaho formed three peaks on the mountain, so that the couple can view the ruins of their former home. Hinerei and Matamiha, the couples&#x27; twin children, were turned to stone, and remain as rock features on the southern Takapuna Beach.

====Te Uru Tapu====

To the north of Takapuna Beach is a wāhi tapu (sacred location) called , a grove of pōhutukawa used for burial ceremonies by Tāmaki Māori. As a part of traditional burial practices, bodies would be wrapped in flax mats and placed in a sitting position in the trees, with the dead later being buried once their bodies had naturally decomposed.

In the early 2000s, the North Shore City Council built a boardwalk through the grove. Access was removed in June 2018 due to risks of falling branches, and access to the grove was not returned after the Auckland Council consulted with seven iwi. In 2021, vandals poisoned and cut down many of the trees in the grove, including karo, karaka, nīkau palms and tōtara, however did not target the pōhutukawa.

===Early colonial period===
The first land purchases at Takapuna were undertaken by Henry Taylor and Alexander Sparks in November 1839. These land sales were later disallowed, and Takapuna was purchased by the Crown on 13 April 1841 as a part of the Mahurangi Block. Farms were auctioned in 1844, and the first European farmers arrived in the Takapuna area in 1847. Early European settlers were predominantly from England, Scotland and Ireland, and they established farms around the lake. Crops such as wheat, maize, barley, potatoes and kūmara were grown at these farms, and homesteads planted single acre orchards dominated by plums, apples and peaches.

In 1849, the Catholic Church purchased land at Takapuna, where Jean-Baptiste Pompallier established St Mary&#x27;s College, a school and later seminary that catered to both European and Māori.

In 1852, the Crown granted of land south of Lake Pupuke to Barry&#x27;s Point / Awataha to Ngāpuhi chief Eruera Maihi Patuone, in order to create a shield for the City of Auckland against potential invasion from Ngāpuhi and other northern tribes. Patuone&#x27;s people lived in the area until the 1880s. Patuone named his settlement , meaning &quot;Waters of Wharariki&quot;, a mat made of harakeke flax. Patuone&#x27;s lands at included a peach tree orchard and a village of twenty huts. Many Ngāpuhi from the settlement worked on the farms at Lake Pupuke, establishing a network of fences for the properties.

In 1863, the first subdivisions were created in Takapuna, where villas were constructed on the eastern shores of Lake Pupuke. The streets were named after famous lakes of the world. A ferry service began to operate from Barry&#x27;s Point at Shoal Bay, and the Takapuna Hotel was established in 1863 near the ferry launch. Despite the Long Depression of the 1880s, Takapuna grew as a community. By this period, sheep breeding had become important in northern Takapuna, and Takapuna dairy farms supplied milk for Auckland. A post office was established in Takapuna in 1880, followed by St Peter&#x27;s Church in 1883.

During fears of Russian invasion in the 1880s, Fort Takapuna was established to the southeast of the suburb. Lake Pupuke became the major source of fresh water for the North Shore, with Devonport receiving fresh water in the 1890s, followed by Northcote in 1906. In 1913, a new pumphouse was constructed on the lake, in order to supply Birkenhead with fresh water.

===Tourism destination and trams===

By the late 1880s, Takapuna had developed into a destination for tourists, with Lake Pupuke being the main attraction. The increase in tourists encouraged farmers to subdivide their lands. The Lake Hotel was constructed, and large summer residences were constructed on the shores of the lake. The earliest subdivisions of farmland for suburban development were the Hurstmere estate in 1886, and the Pupuke Estate in 1889. The Takapuna and Milford Beach areas, as well as the land surrounding Lake Pupuke soon became popular spots for wealthy businessmen building summer homes to entertain in a rural surrounding, and eventually, many moved here permanently, commuting to work in Auckland via ferry.

By the late 1900s, Lake Pupuke diminished in importance for tourists, who were instead attracted to Takapuna Beach. In 1909, the Lake Hotel was destroyed in a fire. The hotel was not replaced, and instead the Mon Desir Hotel on the Takapuna beachfront was opened in 1909.

In 1910, a private tramway was established in Takapuna, which conveyed passengers to the ferry at Bayswater. A group of local businessmen proposed the tramway to Auckland Electric Tramways as a way to improve property prices in Takapuna. After the company declined their request due to the low population of the area, the businessmen established the Takapuna Tramways and Ferry Company Limited, operating both the tram and ferry. The plan was a success, leading to rapid suburban development in Takapuna. The tramway soon became unpopular, and closed 17 years later on 26 April 1927.

In 1914, a local cinema was opened in Takapuna, at the Forester&#x27;s Hall in Anzac Street, and Chinese market gardeners established farms at Barrys Point in the 1920s.

By the 1930s, Takapuna transitioned from a tourist destination into a suburb of Auckland. Summer residences were gradually replaced by permanent housing, and Takapuna developed into a commercial centre on the North Shore. A number of Takapuna buildings date from this period, including Hall&#x27;s Building, the Manona Building and the Strand Buildings.

During World War II, coastal defenses were built around the Takapuna area. A light industrial area developed at Barry Point in the 1950s, the Takapuna War Memorial Hall opened in 1953, and North Shore Hospital was opened as the first major public hospital on the North Shore on 19 July 1958.

===Auckland Harbour Bridge and suburban development===
The Auckland Harbour Bridge was opened in 1959, creating a road bridge between the North Shore and Auckland City, causing an explosion of suburban growth across the North Shore. After the opening of the bridge, Takapuna became the administrative centre for Takapuna City (established in 1961), and later for North Shore City (established in 1989). This drew major retailers to the commercial centre of Takapuna, and branches of Woolworths, Rendells Department Store, and Milne &amp; Choyce opened in the suburb, and were followed by a modern shopping centre, Shore City Shopping Centre.

In 1962, Takapuna became the location where the COMPAC submarine communications cable connected Auckland to Suva, Fiji, and onwards to Vancouver, Canada. The system was in use until 7 December 1984.

In 1996, the Bruce Mason Centre was opened as an events venue for Takapuna. In the late 1990s, the former Smale family farm was redeveloped into Smales Farm, a commercial complex adjacent to the motorway. The Clear Communications Centre opened here in 1999.

==Local government==
The first local government in the area was the Lake Highway District, also known as the Takapuna Highway District, which began operating 1867. In June 1889 the road board was dissolved, in favour of Takapuna being under the direct control of the Waitemata County Council. The Borough of Takapuna was established on 1 July 1913, after 73% of electors in Takapuna voted for independence from the Waitemata County. The first mayor, Ewen Alison, had previously served as the Mayor of Devonport, and by 1914 the borough council began working on improving roads, footpaths and street lighting. In 1954, Takapuna Borough expanded its borders to include Castor Bay to the north.

After significant growth in population, Takapuna Borough became Takapuna City in 1961. On 1 August 1974, the Waitemata County was dissolved, leading to rural northern North Shore areas, such as Glenfield, Albany and Long Bay, to be incorporated into Takapuna City. In 1989, Takapuna City was merged into the North Shore City. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Takapuna is a part of the Devonport-Takapuna local government area governed by the Devonport-Takapuna Local Board. It is a part of the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

<doc id="1224901" wikidata="Q3878463" url="?curid=1224901" title="Norman Chaney">
<text>Norman Myers Chaney (October 18, 1914 – May 29, 1936) was an American child actor, notable for appearing in 19 &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies as &quot;Chubby&quot; from 1929 to 1931.

==Early life and career==
Chaney was born on October 18, 1914 (though Richard Bann and Leonard Maltin&#x27;s book &quot;The Little Rascals: Life &amp; Times of Our Gang&quot; stated he was born in 1918) in Cambridge, Maryland, and became a member of &quot;Our Gang&quot; at the dawn of the sound era. He relied on an affable personality, a flair for funny dialogue, and a priceless frown of frustration. In the fall of 1928, &quot;Our Gang&quot; producer Hal Roach and director Robert F. McGowan began to look for an overweight child actor to replace Joe Cobb in the popular film series. Cobb was twelve years old, and the series was about to transition to sound. Roach and McGowan held a nationwide contest to find a replacement for Cobb. Chaney won this contest in early 1929 and was offered a two-year contract. &quot;He adapted gracefully, and we all liked him, he was a nice fellow,&quot; said McGowan of Chaney. His stay with the series was brief, but he made a memorable impression on generations of fans. He was taught the expression of the &quot;slow burn&quot; by the comedian Edgar Kennedy.

At the time, Chaney was only 3&#x27; 11&quot; and weighed about 113 pounds (119 cm and 51 kg respectively). He was nicknamed &quot;Chubby&quot; for the series and made his debut in the second sound entry, &quot;Railroadin&#x27;&quot;, appearing in 19 &quot;Our Gang&quot; films over a period of two years, including shorts such as &quot;Boxing Gloves&quot; and &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;. Norman Chaney and Joe Cobb appeared in three shorts together. Chaney&#x27;s most memorable moments were in &quot;Love Business&quot;, in which he competed with Jackie Cooper for the affections of their teacher, Miss Crabtree (bringing her flowers and candy, he coyly proposes, &quot;Don&#x27;t call me Norman; Call me &#x27;Chubsy-Ubsy&#x27;&quot;).

By spring 1931, Chaney was getting taller and increasingly heavier. He finished out the 1930–31 season without being offered another contract. Both Chaney and his parents decided he would not pursue acting following his final &quot;Our Gang&quot; short, &quot;Fly My Kite&quot;. Chaney&#x27;s departure occurred during a period of great cast turnover, as Allen Hoskins (a member of the original 1922 cast), Jackie Cooper and Mary Ann Jackson had outgrown the series as well.

==Later years and death==
After leaving the series, Chaney returned to his native Baltimore and attended public school, where he excelled in his studies. In spite of having a normal diet and regular exercise since childhood, he continued to gain weight and eventually topped , though he never grew beyond . His weight continued to increase, and it was discovered that he had a glandular ailment. In 1935, Chaney underwent treatment for the ailment at Johns Hopkins Hospital; his weight then dropped from over to less than .

Chaney became seriously ill from the stress on his body that the rapid weight loss caused and he died from myocarditis on May 29, 1936, at age 21, according to his death certificate. At the time of his death, Chaney weighed . He was the first of the regular &quot;Our Gang&quot; alumni to die.

Chaney was buried in Baltimore Cemetery in his hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. His grave remained unmarked for 76 years because his mother was not able to afford a marker for him or herself. Even though he was paid a weekly salary for his movie appearances, he never received any royalties or residuals for the films&#x27; subsequent uses. An online fundraising drive led by Detroit rock musician MIKAL raised $4,500 for headstones to be placed at the graves of both Chaney and his mother. The etched black granite markers, both of which are 16 inches (40.64 cm) tall and 28 inches (71.12 cm) wide, were unveiled on November 10, 2012.

<doc id="1224902" wikidata="Q830952" url="?curid=1224902" title="Sad Wings of Destiny">
<text>Sad Wings of Destiny is the second studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 26 March 1976 by Gull Records. It is considered the album on which Judas Priest consolidated their sound and image, and songs from it such as &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; and &quot;The Ripper&quot; have since become live standards. It was the band&#x27;s only album to feature drummer Alan Moore on every track.

Noted for its riff-driven sound and the wide range of Rob Halford&#x27;s vocals, the album displays a wide variety of styles, moods and textures, inspired by an array of groups such as Queen, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. The centrepiece &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; is a nearly eight-minute track featuring heavy riffing trading off with high-pitched vocals, extended guitar leads, and a slow, moody breakdown toward the end. &quot;Tyrant&quot; and &quot;The Ripper&quot; are short, dense, high-powered rockers with many parts and changes. Riffs and solos dominate &quot;Genocide&quot;, &quot;Island of Domination&quot;, and &quot;Deceiver&quot;, and the band finds more laid-back moments in the crooning piano-backed &quot;Epitaph&quot; and the moody &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot;.

&quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; had a positive reception but weak sales. The band recorded their first two albums with the independent Gull label under tight budgets; after living off a single meal per day while working side jobs to support themselves, the group grew frustrated with the financial situation and signed with for their next album, &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; (1977). Breaking their contract resulted in the rights to &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; and its demo recordings falling into Gull&#x27;s hands. In retrospect, the album has received acclaim as one of the most important albums in heavy metal history, with the album&#x27;s image and style going on to influence many later metal bands, as well as later Judas Priest albums.

== Background ==
Judas Priest formed in September 1969 in industrial West Bromwich, Birmingham by lead vocalist/founding Al Atkins and bass guitarist/co-founding Brian &quot;Bruno&quot; Steppenhill, who chose the band&#x27;s name, wanting one similar to Black Sabbath&#x27;s. The bands were contemporaries and were both from Birmingham, though Judas Priest failed to find a significant audience until Black Sabbath began to fade from the spotlight. The band&#x27;s guitarists Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing have said the heavy riffing and complexity of the song arrangements were inspired by the factories of Birmingham.

By the time Judas Priest&#x27;s first album, &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;, was released in 1974, there had been so many lineup changes that K.K Downing and Ian Hill were the only remaining original members. The first album displayed a mix of styles from a wide variety of influences, but the band found the performance and production disappointing. The band gigged occasionally through 1975, at times sharing the stage with bands such as Pink Fairies and UFO. Drummer John Hinch left the band for reasons that are disputed and was replaced with Alan Moore in October 1975, who had drummed in an early incarnation of the band.

The band performed the &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot;–&quot;Deceiver&quot; pair on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; the year before the songs appeared on &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;. They were frustrated with the BBC&#x27;s volume restrictions, as high volume is a key component in producing a heavy-metal sound. The band had yet to develop the studs-and-leather image that was to become their trademark; instead, they wore contemporary mid-1970s fashions, including high-heeled boots and frilled shirts, and a long-haired Halford donned a pink satin top which he later said he borrowed from his sister. By 1976, Halford joked that fans should burn their copies of &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;.

Finances were tight: the record label Gull provided a recording budget of £2,000 for each of the band&#x27;s first two albums. During the recording of &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;, band members restricted themselves to one meal a day, and several took on part-time work: Tipton as a gardener, Downing in a factory, and Hill driving a delivery van. The group went into the studio with the intention of making an album that mixed straight-ahead rock with a progressive edge.

== Production ==
Recording took place over two weeks in November and December 1975 at Rockfield Studios in Wales with producers Jeffrey Calvert and Gereint &quot;Max West&quot; Hughes, and Chris Tsangarides as co-engineer. Calvert and Hughes were the main members of the pop group Typically Tropical who topped the UK charts in 1975 with &quot;Barbados&quot;, Gull&#x27;s first hit. The band stayed sober during the recording sessions, which lasted from 3:00 pm until 3:00 am. Mixing took a week at Morgan Studios in London.

David Howells of Gull Records commissioned Patrick Woodroffe to provide the cover art, a piece called &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; depicting a struggling, grounded angel surrounded by flames and wearing a devil&#x27;s three-pronged cross, which was the band&#x27;s symbol. Halford posed Christ-like on the reverse, and Gothic fonts adorned the front and back.

== Songs ==
;Victim of Changes

:The nearly eight-minute &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; displays a wide dynamic range in rhythm, texture, and mood, with heavy riffing, a melodic ballad section, and extended guitar leads. An almost classical-sounding twin-guitar introduction leads to the violent main riff. The lyrics tell of a woman whose hard-drinking results in losing her man to another woman. Inspired by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot;, the heavy riff alternates with a cappella passages, Halford breaking into screaming falsettos during the slow break and dramatic conclusion of the song.

:The track began as two songs: &quot;Whiskey Woman&quot; and &quot;Red Light Lady&quot;. &quot;Whiskey Woman&quot; was an early Priest song by Downing and Atkins that the band chose not to include on their first album, though it had long been a crowd-pleasing opener at live shows and features on early demo recordings. To this the band wove in the slow &quot;Red Light Lady&quot;, a song Halford brought with him from his previous band, Hiroshima.

;The Ripper

:A busy, chugging, riff-heavy rocker, &quot;The Ripper&quot; features arrangements inspired by Queen–particularly in the high-pitched layered opening vocals and classical-tinged twin guitars. The lyrics of the Tipton-penned track are from the point of view of Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper.

;Dreamer Deceiver

:A slow ballad with crooning vocals and screaming lead soloing, the song serves as introduction to the heavy &quot;Deceiver&quot; which follows it. Atkins originally received partial credit for both tracks, but disclaimed involvement in them; later releases removed it.

;Deceiver

:A heavy song with a chugging riff presaging the technical style of speed metal, &quot;Deceiver&quot; features energetic soloing and a heavy, Black Sabbath-like break with soaring, high-pitched vocals, climaxing in a repetitive acoustic closing.

;Prelude

:&quot;Prelude&quot; is a short baroque instrumental, alternating between the tonic and dominant, and is arranged for piano, synthesizer, guitars, and tom-tom drums. Despite the title, &quot;Prelude&quot; is musically unrelated to the following track, &quot;Tyrant&quot;.

;Tyrant

:A heavy track full of many parts and tempo changes, Halford has said &quot;Tyrant&quot; expresses his &quot;aversion towards any form of control&quot;.

;Genocide

:A forward-looking, riff-heavy rocker, bearing the influence of heavy rockers such as the Deep Purple tracks &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot;. Halford expressed hope that the song&#x27;s &quot;strong and graphic&quot; lyrics would &quot;be provocative and somewhat controversial and to stimulate people&quot;. The phrase &quot;sin after sin&quot; from the lyrics to &quot;Genocide&quot; provided the title to the band&#x27;s next album.

;Epitaph

:A quiet track with piano backing and Queen-like layered vocals, Halford said the lyrics to &quot;Epitaph&quot; express frustration at a lack of place for the young or old in modern cities.

;Island of Domination

:The side-closing &quot;Island of Domination&quot; is a heavy rocker with a complex riff in a style reminiscent of Black Sabbath. Downing described the lyrics as personal to Halford, joking of their having &quot;probably a few innuendoes&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; was released 26 March 1976, and seven days earlier &quot;The Ripper&quot; appeared as a single backed with &quot;Island of Domination&quot;. 

The album was initially published and distributed by Janus Records in the United States. 

The album had the A-side and B-side reversed, so that &quot;Prelude&quot; opens the second side and &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; the first, while the sleeve has &quot;Prelude&quot; opening the first side.

The album had little commercial success at first and had difficulty getting noticed due to critical competition from the rise of punk rock. The band supported the album with a headlining tour of the UK from 6 April to 20 June 1976. 

The album was awarded a gold record in 1989. &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; arrived at the same time as other influential metal albums from the late 70&#x27;s – the same year saw the release of &quot;Rising&quot; from Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s Rainbow and &quot;Virgin Killer&quot; from Scorpions.

The band had grown dissatisfied with Gull; the tight finances led Moore to leave the band a second time—this time permanently. 

The album caught the attention of , and with the help of new manager David Hemmings, the band signed with CBS and received a £ budget for their next record, &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; (1977). Downing described how the disappointed feelings the group had over Gull&#x27;s management influenced the dark themes that appeared on &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;. 

The signing required breaking their contract with Gull, resulting in the rights to the first two albums and all related recordings—including demos—becoming property of Gull. 

Gull periodically repackaged and re-released the material from these albums, such as on the 1981 double album &quot;Hero, Hero&quot;. 

For the most part, the band was to abandon the progressive rock elements of their first two albums for a more straight-ahead heavy rock sound; the band revisited these progressive elements in 2008 on the album &quot;Nostradamus&quot;.

&quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; was reissued as part of the band&#x27;s limited edition &quot;50 Heavy Metal Years of Music&quot; box-set, released on October 2021, through Sony Music Entertainment and Legacy Recordings, marking its release for the first time in the group&#x27;s current label.

== Reception and legacy ==
Fans, critics, and the band have come to see &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; as the album on which Judas Priest consolidated their sound and image. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Kris Nicholson gave the album a positive review, comparing it favourably to Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Machine Head&quot; of 1972. Martin Popoff cites the album&#x27;s &quot;reinvention&quot; of the heavy metal genre. The technical dexterity and operatic vocals pointed toward trends in heavy metal that new wave of British heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden were to follow, and the album&#x27;s dark themes reappeared in the 1980s American thrash metal, such as in the music of Slayer and Metallica. An early sign of the band&#x27;s influence was that Van Halen included &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; in their sets before achieving fame. Dave Mustaine of Megadeth relates that his brother-in-law, a religious man, punched him in the face for listening to &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;; Mustaine called this a turning point, where he chose heavy metal as a career as &quot;revenge&quot;. Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth named &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; his second favourite metal album. &quot;PopMatters&quot; described the album as &quot;not-at-all shabby&quot; and listed &quot;Epitaph&quot; as one of its &quot;25 Best Progressive Rock Songs of All Time&quot; in 2011. Halford has called the album his favourite of the band&#x27;s.

&quot;Victim of Changes&quot;, &quot;The Ripper&quot;, &quot;Tyrant&quot;, and &quot;Genocide&quot;—with an extended introduction—appear on the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot; (1979). The first three of those songs have survived until 2019 in the band&#x27;s setlists, with &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; being one of the band&#x27;s most played songs ever, while &quot;Genocide&quot; got retired in the early 1980s until a revival in 2022. With &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot;, &quot;Deceiver&quot; and &quot;Island of Domination&quot; present on 1975–76 set lists, 7 of the album&#x27;s 9 songs have been performed in concert.

During the &quot;Sad Wings&quot; sessions, Howells encouraged the band to work on a heavy metal cover of &quot;Diamonds &amp; Rust&quot; by folk singer Joan Baez, but it did not appear on the album. The band had a hit in the UK with a re-recording of the cover version the following year, after they had moved to CBS Records. Gull released the version from the &quot;Sad Wings&quot; sessions in 1978 on the compilation album &quot;The Best of Judas Priest&quot;.

Judas Priest&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Painkiller&quot; features a winged figure Halford has described as a futuristic version of the Fallen Angel from the &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; cover. The band&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;—with Halford again in the band—revives the Fallen Angel again: the cover concept has the angel rise and seek retribution, and the song &quot;Judas Rising&quot; has him cast off his gloom and rise in optimism.

After Halford left the group in the 1990s, Tim Owens was hired to replace him after auditioning &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; and &quot;The Ripper&quot;. Downing and Tipton thereafter nicknamed Owens &quot;The Ripper&quot;. Judas Priest&#x27;s original singer Al Atkins recorded a version of &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; for his album &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; of 1998. Judas Priest frequently performed the song &quot;Mother Sun&quot; during the &quot;Sad Wings&quot; era, but never recorded it. The ballad, with its Queen-like vocals, has survived only in bootleg recordings. In 2014 Swedish metal band Portrait released a cover version as a B-side on a 2014 CD single.

<text>John Richard Moore Jr. (September 12, 1925 – September 7, 2015) was an American actor who was one of the last survivors of the silent film era. A busy and popular actor during his childhood and youth, he appeared in over 100 films until the early 1950s. Among his most notable appearances were the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series and films such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;Blonde Venus&quot;, &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, and &quot;Eight Iron Men&quot;.

==Career==
John Richard Moore Jr. was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Nora Eileen ( Orr) and John Richard Moore, a banker. His mother was Irish, and his paternal grandparents were from England and Ireland, respectively. 

He made his film debut in 1927 in the silent film &quot;The Beloved Rogue&quot;, where he portrayed silent film star John Barrymore&#x27;s character as a one-year-old baby. He soon gained notable supporting roles. He appeared as Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s son in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s drama &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; (1932). He also appeared with Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;So Big&quot; (1932), with Walter Huston in &quot;Gabriel Over the White House&quot; (1933) and with Spencer Tracy in &quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1933).

In the 1932–33 season Moore appeared in eight films of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series, as the leader of the gang. He left the series after one year to play in more feature films. He is perhaps most remembered for his portrayal of the title character in the 1933 adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

In 1935, he played Joseph Meister in &quot;The Story of Louis Pasteur&quot;. In 1941, he portrayed the brother of Gary Cooper in the war drama &quot;Sergeant York&quot; under the direction of Howard Hawks. He is also famous for giving Shirley Temple her first romantic onscreen kiss, in the film &quot;Miss Annie Rooney&quot;.

Moore served in the United States Army during World War II. Later, he was less successful as a teenage actor and young adult and he often had to play in B-movies such as &quot;Dangerous Years&quot;. One of his last notable film roles was in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947), in which he portrayed Robert Mitchum&#x27;s deaf young assistant, &quot;The Kid&quot;. His last role was a young soldier in &quot;Eight Iron Men&quot; (1952). 

He later performed on Broadway, in stock and on television. He went on to teach and write books about acting, publish &quot;Equity News&quot; for Actors&#x27; Equity Association, and produce industrial films and a short film &quot;The Boy and the Eagle&quot;, which was nominated for an Oscar. He retired from acting in the late 1950s.

==Personal life==
Moore was married three times. His first marriage was to Pat Dempsey from 1948 to 1954. The couple had one child, Kevin Moore. In 1959 he married Eleanor Donhowe Fitzpatrick; they divorced in 1978. His third and final marriage was in 1988 to Jane Powell, to whom he remained married until his death in 2015. The two met when Moore interviewed Powell for &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;, which he had just published. The couple lived in Manhattan and Wilton, Connecticut.

==Later life==

In 1984, Moore published &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star (But Don&#x27;t Have Sex or Take the Car)&quot;, a book about his and others&#x27; experiences as child actors. In 1966, after battling addiction to alcohol and drugs, he founded a public relations firm, Dick Moore and Associates, which he ran until 2010. 

In March 2013, Moore&#x27;s wife reported that he had arthritis and &quot;bouts of dementia&quot;. He died at a hospice in Wilton, Connecticut, on September 7, 2015, five days before his 90th birthday. He was cremated.

<text>David Rosenmann-Taub (3 May 1927 – 11 July 2023) was a Chilean poet, musician and artist. His precocious talent in both literature and music was recognized and encouraged by his father, a polyglot, and his mother, a virtuoso pianist. She began teaching him the instrument when he was two; by nine, he himself was giving piano lessons. He later studied composition, counterpoint and fugue with the celebrated composer Pedro Humberto Allende. He began writing poetry at a very early age; his first published work, a long poem titled &quot;El Adolescente&quot; (“The Adolescent”), was written at age fourteen and appeared four years later in a literary magazine.

Rosenmann-Taub graduated from the University of Chile in 1948. That same year he won the Sindicato de Escritores prize for his first book of poetry, &quot;Cortejo y Epinicio&quot; (&quot;Cortege and Epinicion&quot;), which received a reputation-making review from the preeminent literary critic of Chile, Hernán Díaz Arrieta (known as “Alone”). In the three decades that followed, Rosenmann-Taub published more than ten volumes of poetry, including &quot;Los Surcos Inundados&quot; (&quot;The Flooded Furrows&quot;), &quot;La Enredadera del Júbilo&quot; (&quot;The Vine of Jubilance&quot;), &quot;Los Despojos del Sol&quot; (&quot;The Spoils of the Sun&quot;), and &quot;El Cielo en la Fuente&quot; (&quot;The Sky in the Fountain&quot;). For &quot;Los Surcos Inundados&quot;, he received the Premio Municipal de Poesía, the Chilean equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize. His poetry has been admired by authors as disparate as Witold Gombrowicz, Victoria Ocampo, and Francis de Miomandre.

In 1976, he began to travel, lecturing on poetry, music, and aesthetics in Latin America, Europe, and the United States, where he settled in 1985. Since 2002 his writings have been published in Chile, along with reissues of his older works. Armando Uribe, the 2004 winner of Chile&#x27;s Premio Nacional, described Rosenmann-Taub as “the most important and profound living poet of the entire Spanish language.”

Rosenmann-Taub died on 11 July 2023, at the age of 96.

<text>Ardmore is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Fall River County, South Dakota, United States. The town was founded in 1889 by European-American settlers. The population was 1 at the 2020 census.

==Description==
The town is believed to have been derived from the name of Dora Moore, a local teacher. It is at an elevation of 3,556 feet.

Ardmore was featured in the May 2004 issue of &quot;National Geographic Magazine.&quot; The community is located approximately north of the South Dakota–Nebraska border along South Dakota Highway 71. It is located next to a stretch of BNSF railroad. Approximately 15-25 abandoned houses have survived at the site. The town sign is still standing.

==History==

In 1927, President Calvin Coolidge stopped in Ardmore.

The town survived the Great Depression without one family on welfare. The decline of agriculture and move of young people to other areas for work reduced the population. The last time the town had a recorded population was in 1980, when the 1980 census showed a population of 16 residents.

Ardmore celebrated a reunion on September 4, 2010, at the Ardmore Volunteer Fire Department.

==Education==
The school district is Edgemont School District 23-1.

==Notable person==
* Doc Middleton, a former resident and infamous outlaw

<text>Eugene Gordon Lee (October 25, 1933 – October 16, 2005) was an American child actor, most notable for appearing in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; (&quot;Little Rascals&quot;) comedies as Porky from 1935 to 1939. During his tenure in &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Porky originated the catchphrase &quot;O-tay!&quot;, though it is commonly attributed to fellow character Buckwheat, played by Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas.

==Early life==
Eugene Lee was born in Fort Worth, Texas and was adopted.

==Career==
===&quot;Our Gang&quot;===
Lee began performing in motion pictures in 1935, after producer Hal Roach noted how much the eighteen-month-old toddler looked like &quot;Our Gang&quot; star George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland (who was also from Texas). The Lee family traveled from Texas to Culver City, California. Nicknamed &quot;Porky&quot; by the studio, Eugene Lee joined the cast as Spanky&#x27;s little brother. Porky appeared in 42 &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies over four years. Lee, McFarland, and &quot;Our Gang&quot; co-stars Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer, Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas, and Darla Hood constituted what is today the most familiar incarnation of &quot;Our Gang&quot;.

This group moved from Hal Roach Studios to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938 after Roach sold the series. When Lee grew several inches in height during early 1939 (to the point that the five-year-old was the same height as ten-year-old McFarland), MGM replaced him with Mickey Gubitosi, later better known by the stage name Robert Blake.

=== Educator ===
After leaving the series, Lee retired from motion pictures, and entered public school. As an adult, he became an alternative school educator at Broomfield High School in Colorado. Lee changed his name to Gordon Lee (naming himself after his favorite &quot;Our Gang&quot; director, Gordon Douglas) to avoid any connection with his former acting career.

===Embracing his acting career===
In the early 1980s, Lee began appearing at &quot;Little Rascals&quot; reunions and began a business selling &quot;Porky&quot;-related merchandise. Finally embracing his past, Lee was known to tell &quot;Our Gang&quot; fans &quot;we are relics of history.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
After retiring from education, Lee moved to Minnesota&#x27;s Twin Cities to be closer to his son, Douglas.

Janice McClain was his partner for his final 13 years.

On October 16, 2005, after battling lung cancer and brain cancer, he died in a Minneapolis nursing home at the age of 71, nine days before his 72nd birthday.

<text>John Michael Condon (March 25, 1918 – October 13, 1977) credited as Jackie Condon was an American child actor who was a regular in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short series as an original cast member from 1922 until 1929, during the Hal Roach produced Pathé silent era.

==Biography==
Condon was born in March 1918 in Los Angeles, California. In 1919, he began his acting career by appearing in the film &quot;Jinx&quot;. By 1922, he had appeared in many silent films and later starred in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies as &quot;Jackie&quot;.

When he joined the original Our Gang ensemble in 1921, Condon was a little, tag-along toddler who, although often put off by the older children, was anxious to participate in the gang&#x27;s adventures. As he grew older, Condon&#x27;s character developed into a more All American type. Condon left the series in 1928, after appearing in all 66 Pathé silent comedies and 12 of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer silent comedies.

After he left Our Gang, Condon attended public school and in 1936 graduated from Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, California. In a 1953 episode of the television program &quot;You Asked for It,&quot; Condon stated he was studying dramatics with Florence Enright and hoped to return to acting, although there is no evidence he did so. Condon worked at Rockwell International with fellow Our Gang alumni and co-star Joe Cobb. In 1977, Condon died at age 59 from colon cancer.

<doc id="1224931" wikidata="Q689709" url="?curid=1224931" title="Floorless Coaster">
<text>A Floorless Coaster is a type of steel roller coaster manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them, allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster model began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa at Six Flags Great Adventure, which opened on April 2, 1999, as world&#x27;s first Floorless Roller Coaster. Floorless Roller Coasters typically feature between three and seven inversions in the layout of the coaster.

Since 2007, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters, as the company classifies them as another model. Maurer Söhne has designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car model called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.

== History ==

According to Walter Bolliger, development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996. In 1999, the world&#x27;s first Floorless Coaster opened at Six Flags Great Adventure as Medusa. With the success of Medusa, SeaWorld, Cedar Fair, Six Flags, and independent parks, Janfusun Fancyworld, Parque Warner Madrid, Tivoli Gardens, and Ocean Park Hong Kong have built other coasters of this model at their parks. B&amp;M has built 13 Floorless Coasters from the ground up, with Dominator at Kings Dominion being the only one relocated to another park. They have also converted three of their stand-up roller coasters to Floorless Coasters: Rougarou at Cedar Point, Patriot at California&#x27;s Great America, and Firebird at Six Flags America.

== Design ==
The design of a Floorless Coaster has one main difference from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: there is no floor under the seats. While a train is parked in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking over the edge of the station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and retracts underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed for the next group of riders to load and unload. Aside from the station, Floorless Coasters have similar layouts to B&amp;M&#x27;s sit-down coasters.

== Installations ==

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard has built thirteen Floorless Coasters from the ground up, with three additional that were converted from stand-up roller coasters. The roller coasters are listed in order of opening dates.

&quot;Note&quot;: Although some Dive Coasters (such as SheiKra, Griffon, Valravn and Yukon Striker) feature floorless trains, they are &quot;not&quot; considered Floorless Coasters.

== Similar rides ==
Maurer Söhne, a German roller coaster and steel manufacturer, has developed their own version of the Floorless Coaster called the X-Car Floorless. The car is the same as the original X-Car with the only difference being that there is no floor during the ride. As of 2019, no X-Car Floorless roller coasters have been manufactured.

<text>Joe Frank Cobb (November 7, 1916 – May 21, 2002) was an American child actor, most notable for appearing as the original &quot;fat boy&quot; in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies from 1922 to 1929.

==Early life and career==
Born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, on November 7, 1916, Cobb auditioned for producer Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy series at the age of five in 1921. He first worked with the series in 1922, appearing in &quot;The Champeen&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Big Show&quot; (1923).

Cobb appeared in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series&#x27; last silent film, &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Lesson&quot;, and its first talking short, &quot;Small Talk&quot;, both in 1929.
His penultimate episode as a regular cast member was &quot;Boxing Gloves&quot; (1929) when he was 12. Joining him in that film (a remake of &quot;The Champeen&quot;) is &quot;Chubby&quot; (14-year-old Norman Chaney), Cobb&#x27;s successor as the &quot;fat kid&quot;, and Jackie Cooper in his film debut. 

Cobb&#x27;s final regular &quot;Our Gang&quot; appearance was in the &quot;Lazy Days&quot; episode (released August 4, 1929). He appeared in 86 &quot;Our Gang&quot; films during the seven years from 1922 to 1929. He also made three cameo appearances during the 1930s, in &quot;Fish Hooky&quot; (1933), &quot;Pay as You Exit&quot; (1936), and &quot;Reunion in Rhythm&quot; (1937).

After his acting career ended in the early 1940s, Cobb became an assembler for North American Aviation, a division of Rockwell International in Downey, California. He retired in 1981 at age 65.

==Death==
Cobb died of natural causes on May 21, 2002, in Santa Ana, California.

<doc id="1224947" wikidata="Q18620" url="?curid=1224947" title="Damnation (album)">
<text>Damnation is the seventh studio album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. It was released on 22 April 2003, five months after &quot;Deliverance&quot;, which was recorded at the same time. &quot;Damnation&quot; is the last Opeth album to date to be produced by Steven Wilson although he did mix two future albums, &quot;Heritage&quot; and &quot;Pale Communion&quot;. Mikael Åkerfeldt dedicated both Damnation and Deliverance to his grandmother, who died in a car accident during the time the albums were being recorded.

The album was a radical departure from Opeth&#x27;s typical death metal sound, and the first Opeth album to use all clean vocals, clean guitars, and prominent Mellotron, as well as being inspired by 1970s progressive rock, particularly the work of the British band Camel, which typically features no heavy riffs or extended fast tempos. Despite the change in style from Opeth&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Damnation&quot; was critically acclaimed and boosted their popularity, leading to the release of &quot;Lamentations&quot; on DVD in late 2003.

== Production ==
Like &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Damnation&quot; was recorded during the same trouble-plagued sessions at Nacksving Studios and Studio Fredman. The majority of the recording of both albums was done, save for most of the &quot;Damnation&quot; vocals. For those parts, Åkerfeldt flew down to Wilson&#x27;s studio No Man&#x27;s Land in the UK, just a day after his grandmother&#x27;s funeral.

== Critical reception ==

In a rave review for Sputnikmusic, Mike Stagno wrote that &quot;Damnation&quot; is a progressive rock album that departs entirely from the extreme metal elements of Opeth&#x27;s previous work, and stands as one of the best albums released in recent years. Ned Raggett of Pitchfork Media also felt that it succeeds without Opeth&#x27;s previous death metal style, and showcases each band member&#x27;s technical abilities on what is &quot;the most surprising and entertaining album&quot; in Opeth&#x27;s discography.

In 2014, TeamRock put &quot;Damnation&quot; at number 91 on their &quot;Top 100 Greatest Prog Albums of All Time&quot; list commenting: &quot;the first Opeth album to abandon metal entirely, &quot;Damnation&quot; trumped its heavier sibling &quot;Deliverance&quot; by bringing Mikael Åkerfeldt’s masterful songwriting to the fore&quot;.

&quot;Loudwire&quot; listed &quot;Damnation&quot; as the second best album of 2003. Mike Portnoy, drummer for Dream Theater, put the album on his list of best albums of 2003.

<text>The first USS &quot;Lang&quot; (DD-399) was a &quot;Benham&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after John Lang, a sailor in the United States Navy.

==History==
&quot;Lang&quot; was laid down by the Federal Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, 5 April 1937, launched 27 August 1938, sponsored by Mrs William D. Leahy, wife of Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations and commissioned 30 March 1939.
&quot;Lang&quot; departed New York 12 August 1939 guarding President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s passage to Campobello, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. In November, the destroyer left Newport, Rhode Island, for Galveston, Texas and duty on the Gulf Patrol. Transferred to the Pacific, she reached San Diego 18 March 1940 and Pearl Harbor 2 April, where she participated in fleet training exercises. She voyaged between the West Coast and Hawaii for the remainder of 1940 and early 1941 engaged in escort duties and training.

In June 1941 she returned to the Caribbean and Atlantic coast for carrier and antisubmarine training. In December she acted as screen and aircraft guard during flight operations for and &quot;Ranger&quot; off the Maine coast and Bermuda.

She sailed to Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, for patrols with ships of the Royal Navy, then sailed for the British West Indies in January 1942. In transit, she answered a distress call from torpedoed SS &quot;Empire Wildebeeste&quot; and rescued 21 survivors. She left Bermuda on 18 March for Casco Bay, Maine and sailed 26 March escorting TF 39 which included carrier &quot;Wasp&quot;. The force rendezvoused with three British ships on 3 April and entered Scapa Flow, Scotland, the next day. The destroyer then became a part of Force &quot;W&quot;, sailing between England and the Mediterranean to deliver Spitfires to the besieged island of Malta (see Operations Calendar and Bowery). &quot;Lang&quot; returned to Norfolk on 28 May and transferred to San Diego a month later.

As flagship for DesDiv 15, part of TF 18, &quot;Lang&quot; departed San Diego 1 July to join shore bombardment exercises off Tonga in preparation for the Guadalcanal-Tulagi landings. Three weeks later she screened &quot;Wasp&quot; as the carrier launched her aircraft in the first American land offensive of the Pacific war.

Operating from the New Hebrides, &quot;Lang&quot; carried out patrol and escort missions in the effort to reconquer the Solomons. On 22 and 24 January 1943, she shelled Japanese positions near Kokumbona, Guadalcanal. In July, &quot;Lang&quot; and four other destroyers sailed for Kula Gulf escorting six APDs to the New Georgia landings. Early on the 18th, the American force sighted and attacked three Japanese destroyers forcing them to retire behind smokescreens. The ships completed their mission and sailed for Purvis Bay, located in the Nggela Islands, part of the Solomon Islands from which &quot;Lang&quot; and two other destroyers escorted five LCIs to the landings at Onaiavisi, New Georgia, on 31 July, where during an enemy air attack &quot;Lang&quot; claimed an aircraft shot down.

&quot;Lang&quot;&#x27;, in company with five other destroyers, was tasked to intercept enemy forces in Vella Gulf, part of the “Tokyo Express” route. On the nights of 6 August and 7 August the task group sank three Japanese destroyers, &quot;Kawakaze&quot;, &quot;Arashi&quot; and &quot;Hagikaze&quot;, which had been attempting to reinforce Kolombangara. Two nights later they drove off groups of Japanese troop transports. After 3 months of escort duty. &quot;Lang&quot; joined TF 50 for the invasion of the Gilberts 23 to 30 November, bombarded Nauru on 9 December and early in the new year bombarded Roi, Namur.

Then she joined TF 58 for the occupation of Kwajalein, returning to escort duties 15 March 1944. During the summer she operated with TF 58 during the Marianas campaign, screening the fast carrier force, returning to Tulagi on 17 August after the victory in the Marianas.

&quot;Lang&quot; next sailed to Wewak, New Guinea, 31 August to lay a minefield and shelled shore positions. She then escorted two reinforcement convoys bound for Morotai from 16 September to 3 October through heavy enemy air attacks. On 8 October she took the torpedoed &quot;Shelton&quot; (DE-407) in tow but she capsized and sank.

&quot;Lang&quot; departed Hollandia 10 October for the Leyte Gulf operation. Though she came under kamikaze attacks, she suffered no damage and claimed an enemy aircraft shot down. She departed the battle area for Manus on 31 October and on Christmas Day sailed with TF 78 for the Lingayen Gulf landings, where she was attacked by kamikazes and claimed another aircraft destroyed.

<text>Ernest Fredric Morrison (December 20, 1912 – July 24, 1989) was an American child actor, comedian, vaudevillian, and dancer who also performed under the stage-name Sunshine Sammy Morrison. He was the only black member of the &quot;East Side Kids&quot; and was an original performer in &quot;Our Gang&quot;, a 1920&#x27;s silent film franchise.

==Early life==
Born in 1912 in New Orleans, Morrison was the brother of Florence Morrison and stage- and screen-actress Dorothy Morrison. He entered show-business as a replacement for another infant actor who constantly cried. A crew member asked Morrison&#x27;s father, Ernest Morrison Sr., to bring in his newborn son. Because Morrison sat perfectly and didn&#x27;t cry during filming, the crew christened him with the name &quot;Sunshine&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s father added &quot;Sammy&quot; to his son&#x27;s stage name to create the iconic character Sunshine Sammy.

==Biography==
Morrison ultimately appeared in two-reel silent comedies opposite both Harold Lloyd and Snub Pollard, two of the era&#x27;s biggest comedians. He was the first African-American actor to be signed to a long-term contract, signing with studio executive and comedy producer Hal Roach in 1919. When Roach conceived his &quot;Our Gang&quot; series, featuring child actors in a natural juvenile setting in 1921, Sammy was the first child recruited. Morrison left the series in January 1925; the young actor was then making $225 a week (equal to about $4,000 weekly in 2024), and his father demanded a pay raise of $75 a week, which Roach refused. Ernie Morrison&#x27;s last Roach credits were Jimmie Parrott comedies; these had been filmed in 1923 but were not released to theaters until 1926.

Ernie Morrison went to make personal appearances in vaudeville, where his talents were featured on the same bills with such up-and-coming acts as Abbott and Costello and Jack Benny.

After touring in Australia with partner Sleepy Williams, Morrison returned to the United States and was chosen by producer Sam Katzman to be one of the East Side Kids. From the beginning, Morrison tapped into his experiences growing up on the East Side of New York City to shape the character of &quot;Scruno.&quot; He spent three years with the gang before leaving to pursue other opportunities, often doing promotional stints with Huntz Hall and Bobby Jordan. Morrison left the series when he was offered an opportunity to work with the Step Brothers act, a prominent black stage-and-film dance act. He was drafted into the army during World War II. After being discharged, he was offered a part in &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot;, the successor to the East Side Kids that was just being launched, but he declined the offer. Morrison &quot;didn&#x27;t like the setup&quot;: Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall were now the stars of the troupe, and Bobby Jordan and the other gang members were now incidental players and paid much less.

Morrison later worked as a quality control inspector for an aerospace company in Compton, California. In later years, Morrison appeared in a guest spot on the sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; airing in 1974.

Morrison died of cancer in Lynwood aged 76, on July 24, 1989. He is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California, where later &quot;Our Gang&quot; cast member Buckwheat Thomas is also buried.

<doc id="1224955" wikidata="Q2664232" url="?curid=1224955" title="Junya Nakano">
<text>is a Japanese video game composer. After working for Konami in the early 1990s, he was employed by Squaresoft and then Square Enix from 1995 to 2009. He is best known for scoring &quot;Threads of Fate&quot; and co-composing &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; for Squaresoft, arranging for &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; and the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; for Square Enix, and scoring arcade video games such as &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Mystic Warriors&quot; for Konami. Nakano has collaborated with Masashi Hamauzu on a number of games.

He was introduced to music at the age of three when his parents offered him lessons in the electronic organ. After studying composition and arrangement at a vocational school, Nakano worked for Konami from 1991 to 1994, where he scored numerous arcade games. Nakano is noted for his ambient style and for using percussion, timbre, and rhythm in his compositions.

==Biography==
Junya Nakano was born in Kyoto, Japan. His parents introduced him to music when he was three years old, offering him lessons in the electronic organ through the Yamaha Music Foundation; they also encouraged him to join some brass bands. After playing the 1979 arcade game &quot;Lunar Rescue&quot;, he developed an interest in video games and subsequently began to enjoy chiptune music. By frequently listening to the radio, he started composing MIDI music using the NEC PC-9801 in 1985. In 1987, he attended a vocational school to study composition and arrangement in hopes of entering the gaming industry. After graduation, he joined the Kobe branch of Konami in 1991, where he contributed music to eight arcade games with several collaborators over a three-year period, including titles such as &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Mystic Warriors&quot;. Deciding he wanted to create more original music and have a chance to receive individual recognition, Nakano left Konami after completing the score for &quot;Golfing Greats 2&quot; in 1994.

Nakano joined Square (now Square Enix) in 1995. He created four pieces for the 1996 video game &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot;, which featured composers Nobuo Uematsu, Yasunori Mitsuda, and Masashi Hamauzu. His first solo project came about with Satellaview&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Conflix&quot; the same year. In 1996, Nakano joined several of Square&#x27;s composers to create the soundtrack for the fighting game &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;; he contributed three compositions. Hamauzu and Nakano became friends after working on &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot; and &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;, and they have later collaborated on several titles. In 1997, Nakano served as synthesizer programmer for the score to &quot;Front Mission: Alternative&quot;. Nakano composed the soundtrack for the Japan-only adventure game &quot;Another Mind&quot;, which he was given a deadline of two months to complete. His subsequent score to the 1999 title &quot;Threads of Fate&quot; (known as &quot;Dewprism&quot; in Japan) gave him worldwide recognition.

Since scoring &quot;Threads of Fate&quot;, Nakano has collaborated with several composers on major projects instead of being the sole composer. In 2001, Nakano and Hamauzu were chosen to assist Uematsu in the production of the score for the critically acclaimed &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu&#x27;s style; Nakano created 20 pieces. One of his tracks from the game, &quot;Guadosalam&quot;, was arranged for the piano and featured in the album &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot; (2002). Following &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, Nakano composed the soundtrack to Asmik Ace Entertainment&#x27;s flight simulator &quot;Sidewinder F&quot;.

Back at Square Enix, he created the music for &quot;&quot; with Hamauzu and the duo Wavelink Zeal (Takayuki and Yuki Iwai) in 2004. In 2006, Nakano created seven tracks for the Xbox 360 game &quot;Project Sylpheed&quot;, which also featured several other composers. Later the same year, he arranged four pieces from the &quot;Mana&quot; series for &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; (known as &quot;Seiken Densetsu 4&quot; in Japan). He was also selected to arrange half of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;″s Nintendo DS remake under the supervision of Uematsu, and composed the soundtrack to its 2008 sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy IV: The After Years&quot;. On December 31, 2009, Nakano confirmed that he had left Square Enix and would be joining his former mentor and collaborator Yuji Takenouchi&#x27;s supergroup &quot;GeOnDan&quot;, whom have since disbanded. Nakano&#x27;s last projects for Square Enix before leaving were the soundtracks to &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Prince of the Dawn&quot; and &quot;Daughter of the Dusk&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Nakano is best known for creating ambient music with percussive, timbral, and rhythmic elements. According to an interview conducted by the website RocketBaby.net, Nakano was composing music focusing on an instrument&#x27;s tone and acoustics until 1995, while after that time, he slowly moved his focus toward studying the harmony and melody important to music as a whole. After joining Square, he started focusing on rhythm and timbre which he implemented in titles like &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot;, &quot;Treasure Conflix&quot;, and &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;. The music in &quot;Threads of Fate&quot; contains many different styles like ambient, jazz, and Spanish music; the tracks have been described as &quot;mellow&quot; and &quot;upbeat&quot;. For &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, Nakano was responsible for most of the ambient-styled compositions, which featured percussion, timbre, and rhythm. Nakano stated in the original soundtrack&#x27;s liner notes that he wanted to create music with a &quot;vibrant and dynamic feel&quot; that tied together his years of experience with game music.

When starting out in the field of music, he was influenced by brass bands he was involved with and electronic organ music; however, he could not think of a specific musician who influenced him. Nakano cites Hamauzu as the colleague he admires most at Square Enix, and is particularly interested in the sounds he creates. When asked about his thoughts of Uematsu and how he had influenced his work, Nakano replied: &quot;He is a very youthful and active person, but he hasn&#x27;t influenced my work.&quot;

==Works==
&quot;All works listed below were composed by Nakano unless otherwise noted.&quot;

<doc id="1224957" wikidata="Q5001358" url="?curid=1224957" title="BushBuck Charms, Viking Ships &amp; Dodo Eggs">
<text>Bushbuck Charms, Viking Ships &amp; Dodo Eggs, also known as Bush Buck: Global Treasure Hunter, is an educational computer game released in 1991. Designed by the Australian company Reckon, the game was published by &quot;PC Globe&quot;, a small US-based company that specialized in &quot;edutainment&quot; software in the late 1980s and early 90s. In the tradition of Broderbund&#x27;s Carmen Sandiego games, &quot;Bushbuck Charms, Viking Ships and Dodo Eggs&quot; taught geography through a storyline that involved a global scavenger hunt for unusual items. Each game, the player had to find fifteen items which the game chose from a selection of hundreds of possible items. A few of the possible items were a hemlock leaf, a lava-lava, and an alpaca poncho. The game ran on the Amiga and MS-DOS platforms.

==Gameplay==

The game is played by flying from city to city seeking treasures as laid out at the beginning of the round. The game has three possible modes, one player with no computer player (not available in advanced skill), one player with computer player, and two player.

The game starts in a randomly selected city which becomes the home base for that round&#x27;s competition, to which the player must return to redeem treasures for points and additional tickets. If the player collects all available items, a one way flight back to the home base city is rewarded. Five items are made available at any one time with a total of fifteen items available for the entire round.

===Weather===
Different weather-related obstacles are presented while heading from city to city. At times the player may have to choose to either fly through a blizzard, typhoon, hailstorm, rain storm, hurricane, or pick another city than the one intended. If the player chooses to go through the storm, they may make it, or they may be redirected back to the original city. If there are any items on board when flying through inclement weather, they will be roughed up, and be worth less points when turned in.

===Tickets===
The player starts with a set number of tickets at the beginning of the round (60 in beginner, 50 in intermediate, 40 in advanced). One ticket is used per flight, and if a player chooses to fly through a storm and does not make it to the desired destination, between one and three tickets need to be cashed in to pay for damages to the plane. When the player returns items to the home base, 10 additional tickets are given per item returned.

===Infoboxes===
Each city has an &quot;infobox&quot; which pops up either when the player flies into the city, or when the player clicks on the city in the pointer mode. The infoboxes contain varied interesting information about the city, from famous people from there to who founded it, and have an underlined feature such as a monument or attraction present in that city.

===Clues===
Clues are available at certain cities as indicated by a little black box on the map. Five clues are available for each item, and the clues get progressively more helpful as the player finds them. City features, historical facts, and pop culture references, as well as infobox information is used.

===Skill Levels===
The game has three levels of skill: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

As a &quot;Beginner&quot; the player faces a stereotyped French person called Pierre. On Beginner, there is a gauge on the left on the screen that shows how close the player is to an item. So in theory, the player could follow the gauge until, by a process of elimination, the item is found. The European version of the game features instead a typical Texan person that goes by the name of John.

On the &quot;Intermediate&quot; level the player faces a stereotyped Russian person called Natasha. On Intermediate, the gauge is removed and is replaced by a button with an eye on it. When the player is in the right city, the eye lights up, which when pressed gives the item over to the player.

When playing on &quot;Advanced&quot; the player faces a German aristocrat called Otto. On Advanced, the eye remains, but the lighting up feature is removed so the city which the item is in must be pinpointed exactly to reveal the item in question.
Otto occasionally flies long distance flights that the player cannot. He sends the player to the wrong country, not the city the player clicked. If the player happens to be in the same city as Otto when an item is found, Otto will take it. Also, if the player flies to a country Otto has visited, a picture of Otto appears above the infobox with a speech bubble saying &quot;Otto vaz ere!&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called the graphics and audio mediocre, but recommended the game to children and adults interested in geography and maps.

<text>Richard Daniels Jr. (October 11, 1914 – August 20, 1970) known professionally as Mickey Daniels, was an American actor. Signed by Hal Roach in 1921, he was, along with Joe Cobb, Jackie Condon, Jackie Davis, Mary Kornman, and Ernie Morrison, a regular in the popular &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies during the silent era of the series, between 1922 and 1926.

==Early life and career==
Daniels was born in Rock Springs, Wyoming, the son of Welsh-born American actor Richard Daniels and his wife Hannah. In 1921, Daniels was discovered by a talent scout while performing at an amateur night at the Rialto Theatre in Rock Springs. Shortly thereafter, he was signed by Hal Roach to appear in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; film series.

The red-haired, freckle-faced Daniels was one of the lead characters in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; film shorts from 1922 to 1926. In the earlier shorts, he was often a rival (often with Davis) for Mary Kornman&#x27;s attentions. He first appeared in the first Our Gang short &quot;Our Gang&quot; in 1922 when he was 8 years old. He was known for his big, distinctive laugh and a gift for physical comedy and timing. Daniels stayed with the series for four years until he left the series at the age of 12 in 1926. His last film was the 1926 short &quot;Thundering Fleas&quot;, in which he appeared with equally freckle-faced Jay R. Smith, who then replaced Daniels.

After &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Daniels continued his career in vaudeville and played bit parts in feature films and comedy shorts. From 1930 to 1932, Daniels and former &quot;Our Gang&quot; co-star Mary Kornman appeared in the film series &quot;The Boy Friends&quot; for Hal Roach. He continued public appearances with co-star Mary Kornman for feature film roles in the 1940s.

==Post acting career==
After 1951, Daniels quit the movie industry and began working in construction engineering in the United States and overseas. In 1967, he began working as a taxi driver for Red Top Taxi in San Diego. He remained at that job until his death.

==Death==
Daniels became a chronic alcoholic and was found dead on August 20, 1970, in a transient hotel in San Diego. His death was attributed to cirrhosis. Daniels is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale in Glendale, California.

The album debuted with its highest chart position in &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Albums Chart at #153.

The album also received two Billboard Music Award nominations for &quot;Talk to Me&quot; and two Soul Train Lady of Soul Award nominations - one for Album of the Year By a Group, Band or Duo and one for Best Music Video for &quot;Talk to Me&quot;.

<text>Aotea Square () is a large paved public area in the CBD of Auckland, New Zealand. Officially opened in 1979 by Sir Dove-Myer Robinson next to Queen Street, it is used for open-air concerts and gatherings, markets, and political rallies. 
In November 2010, a major redevelopment of Aotea Square was completed. The square was redesigned to make it appropriate for use by crowds of up to 20,000 people.

Its name is derived from &quot;Motu Aotea&quot;, the Māori name for Great Barrier Island, which is the largest offshore island of New Zealand, approximately from downtown Auckland.

The square was created in 1979, with a large part of it being the former end of Grey&#x27;s Avenue, which used to connect directly to Queen Street – a large underground carpark with 930 spaces had been erected underneath in 1975.

In 2000 a competition for a redesign was held, but in 2004, before the winning design by Ted Smyth and Associates (including Rod Barnett and Dr Dushko Bogunovich) could be built, damage to the car park roof was discovered, which stopped the project. While the roof was temporarily stabilised and plans for its repair made, a consultation process initiated by mayor Dick Hubbard called &#x27;Outside the Square&#x27; resulted in a new proposal. This proposal was abandoned after it was estimated to cost up to $600 million. After this the old design was revised several times (including some feedback from public consultation in August 2008) and was adopted in 2008.
Construction started in November 2008 and ran to late 2010, during which there were no events in the square. The project was projected to cost NZ$80 million, around $45 million for the car park repair, $25 million for the upgrade, and $10 million for works on the Aotea Centre facade. A cost saving of $15 million was identified during the process due to a modified construction process for the car park roof, which allowed the project to dispense with building a temporary car park.

=== Significant events===
Aotea Square is often utilised for public events, including fairs, protest rallies, music festivals and rock concerts.

Aotea Square was site of a major civil disturbance on 7 December 1984, during a free end-of-academic year rock concert given by bands including Herbs and DD Smash. A power cut interrupted the concert for a time, and some of the concert-goers began throwing bottles at police in attendance, who called up additional forces in riot gear but at first did not intervene further.

Dave Dobbyn, DD Smash&#x27;s lead singer, was later accused of having incited a riot by declaring &quot;I wish those riot squad guys would stop wanking and put their little batons away&quot;, followed by an announcement by Triple M, the radio station promoting the concert, that the performance would be stopped on the request of the police. This caused a riot amongst parts of the audience, who moved into Queen Street, smashing shop windows and overturning cars, causing over NZ$ 1 million in reported damage.

Others present noted that the rioting was influenced by a number of factors, including the large number of intoxicated audience members, youth relief about the end of the Muldoon era, and a confrontational attitude by the police, who allegedly blocked the exits from the concert area, giving the crowd no obvious way to disperse.

The riot was the subject of a Commission of Inquiry headed by Peter Mahon.

Beginning on 15 October 2011, the square was the site of an Occupy Movement protest. Protesters pitched tents and erected ad hoc shelters and camped on the grassy areas, intending to occupy the site for six weeks until 30 November. In fact, the occupation lasted into January 2012, when Auckland Council served trespass notices and security guards and police jointly removed or arrested the occupiers on 23 January 2012. The occupation was over by the end of January, with a total of 30 arrests.

==Surroundings==

The Edwardian Auckland Town Hall is at the Queen Street entrance to the square. It has a main concert chamber with excellent acoustics, and was extensively restored and upgraded in 1994.

To the south of the square are the Administration block of the Auckland City Council and the entry to Myers Park.

On the western side of the square is Auckland&#x27;s main conference and theatre venue, the Aotea Centre. The foyer contains art works by many New Zealand artists including a full-length portrait in bronze of Dame Kiri Te Kanawa by Terry Stringer.

To the north of the square is a cinema/theatre complex which includes the Event Cinema venue in the IMAX centre, and the 1929 Civic Theatre, which was built in the atmospheric theatre style; its main chamber is illuminated with lights placed to correspond with the constellations of the southern night sky.

Aotea Square was originally the location of a swamp, filled and drained by the Waihorotiu Stream. The stream was turned into an open sewer canal and eventually bricked over and the swampy area drained. A three-storey underground parking garage accessible from Mayoral Drive and Greys Avenue was constructed in the 1970s.

== Public art==


A number of art works are in Aotea Square:

* At the Queen Street entrance is an arch called &quot;Waharoa&quot; (&quot;Gateway&quot; in Māori), formed in wood and copper by Selwyn Muru, a Māori sculptor. This is an expressionist version of a traditional Māori entry gate. It features symbols like birds, fish and the crescent moon and stars but also elements like the nuclear disarmament symbol, reflecting the modern influences on New Zealand art.
* In front of the Town Hall is a bronze statue of Sir Dove-Myer Robinson, a former mayor of Auckland. This work dates from 2003 and is by the New Zealand sculptor Toby Twiss.
* Near the Town Hall is a bronze figure of a Māori warrior by Lyndon Smith, commissioned in the 1960s for the lobby of the Auckland Saving Bank&#x27;s new building on Queen Street. In 1997 the ASB presented it to the City of Auckland. [This item is currently in storage awaiting relocation]
* In the centre of the square was the &quot;Mountain Fountain&quot; sculpture by New Zealand sculptor Terry Stringer. This angular &quot;mountain&quot; was commissioned in 1979 to form the centre piece for the new square, and its form echoes the roofline of the contemporary Aotea Centre. In 2009 media controversy centred on the speculation that Council prefers to permanently remove the fountain, despite having assured its sculptor that it will return after the maintenance work on the car park roof. The fountain was in fact later relocated to the forecourt of the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Parnell, though by then with the artist&#x27;s agreement.
* In front of the Administration building is a 19th-century bronze statue of George Eden, Lord Auckland, Governor of India, after whom the city of Auckland is named. This statue was originally erected in Calcutta and was purchased from the government of India by Auckland City Council in the early 1960s.
* In April 2011 Auckland Council placed in the square a large temporary sculpture by Japanese artist Ujino, titled Dragonhead and said to represent the homogeneity of consumer culture and globalisation.

<doc id="1224983" wikidata="Q7226187" url="?curid=1224983" title="Polycatenane">
<text>A polycatenane is a chemical substance that, like polymers, is chemically constituted by a large number of units. These units are made up of concatenated rings into a chain-like structure.

It consists of mechanically linked catenane structures, via topological Hopf links, resulting in a higher dimensionality than the repeating unit. They are a class of catenanes where the number of macrocycles is greater than two and as catenanes they belong to the big family of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures (MIMAs).

 The characteristic feature of a polycatenane compound, that distinguishes it from other polymers, is the presence of mechanical bonds in addition to covalent bonds. The rings in this chain-like structure can be separated only when high energy is provided to break at least a covalent bond of the macrocycle. [&quot;n&quot;]-Catenanes (for large n), which consist solely of the mechanically interlocked cyclic components, can be viewed as “optimized” polycatenanes. The main difference between poly-[&quot;2&quot;]-catenanes and poly-[&quot;n&quot;]-catenanes is the repeating unit, as a monomer is for the polymer. In the first case the monomer is made of two interlocked rings that repeat continuously in the final polycatenane, while in the latter case there is only one ring that repeat the interlocking process for a large number of times. If the rings of the polycatenane are all of the same type, it can be defined as a homocatenane while if the subunits are different it is defined as heterocatenane.

As a chain, the degree of motion of these structures is very high, greater than the one of a usual polymer, because the rings possess a reciprocal rotational, elongational and rocking motion. This flexibility is retained even if the macrocycles themselves are very rigid units, because the mobility is given by the ability of the rings to move with respect to each other. This mobility influences the final properties of the material (mechanical, rheological and thermal), and provides a dynamic behavior.

== Classification ==

Depending on the location of the catenane structures in the polymer chain, the polycatenanes can be divided into main-chain polycatenanes and side-chain polycatenanes.

Main-chain polycatenanes are linear catenanes in which the rings are interlocked in a large number of units. They can also be a series of oligomers linked physically even if not interlocked together. The stability of the structure is not only given by mechanical bonds but also hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions between the rings.

On the other hand, the side-chain polycatenanes are polycatenanes with ramifications where more oligomers are connected on the same cycle with respect to the main backbone. This type of catenane is synthesised, functionalising the macrocycles so that there is directionality with the possibility to control the ramification.

There are other types of polycatenanes like the ones based on cyclic polymers, where the macrocyles are interlocked to the cyclic polymers, or the polycatenane networks, where catenanes are interlocked into a net.

=== Catenated nanocages ===
The basic unit of the polycatenane can differ from the relatively simple organic macrocycle. When organic and inorganic building blocks come together, they can form coordination cages (or macromolecular cages) that can interlock with one another to form a polycatenane structure. The mechanism is still unexplored but generally the subunits self-assemble into a 0D cage and, in a concerted process, interlock together into a linear or more intricate catenane structure. Sometimes the catenated cages structure is more stable with respect to the monomeric cage state, and it can be formed passing through a favored reaction intermediate. The synthesis can follow a statistical or a directed routes, forming more or less product, but there are some cases when post-synthetic modifications can increase the product yields. Catenated cages can be applied in a wide range of application due to the high presence of voids.

== Synthesis and applications ==

=== Synthesis ===
The synthesis of polycatenanes is considered a challenging task with most of the reported examples being in the solution state and very few in the solid state. The formation of poly-[&quot;2&quot;]-catenanes can be achieved by polymerisation of functionalised [&quot;2&quot;]-catenanes. Also the synthesis of [&quot;3&quot;]-catenanes, [&quot;5&quot;]-catenanes, [&quot;6&quot;]-catenanes and [&quot;7&quot;]-catenanes is reported in many articles. The synthesis of poly-[&quot;n&quot;]-catenanes has instead some practical issues. To this purpose, molecular dynamic simulation is very used as a tool for the design of the optimal synthetic path toward the desired product by predicting the final topology.

There are two main synthetic routes: the statistical approach and the template-directed approach.

The statistical approach is based on a stochastic methodology. When the reactants are together, there is a probability that they will fit together first and then close on top of each other in a process of cyclisation. The catenation of two rings into a catenane is already complex, thus, as expected, the interlocking of multiple cycles into a polycatenane is statistically improbable. Being an unfavored entropically process the product is obtained in very small amounts. Also, the cyclisation process requires high dilutions, but the elongation of the chain is favored at high concentrations, making the synthesis even more difficult.

The template-directed approach is based on the host-guest interactions that can direct the cyclisation of pre-organised linear unit upon the existing macrocycle. These interactions can be hydrogen bonds, π-π interactions, hydrophobic interactions or metal ions coordinations. In this way the synthesis can be enthalpy-driven, obtaining quantitative results.

The yield and selectivity are restrained by the kinetic or thermodynamic control of the reaction.

Generally the kinetic control induces the formation of a product after short reaction times because it is favoued by irreversible reactions (or equilibrium reaction moved very much toward the formation of the products). The thermodynamic product is obtained for longer reaction times for reversible processes. In this case the units have the time to rearrange themselves toward the most stable state, in a sort of error-checking process. This is obtained by breaking covalent and coordination bonds and forming the most stable ones.

=== Applications ===
Given that polycatenanes are a relatively recent field of study, the properties of these materials are not yet fully explored and understood. The type of bonds that characterize the whole structure (covalent, non-covalent or mechanical bonds), the degree of mobility of the chain, the interactions between different chains and the fraction of voids of the catenanes are all factors that contribute to the final properties. As they can be strictly related to the family of metal-organic frameworks, the catenanes share all the potential applications of this class of compounds. Among these, there are applications in biomedicine, catalysis, as conducting bridges or in electronic devices, sensing or in recent fields like molecular machines.

<doc id="1224985" wikidata="Q6858968" url="?curid=1224985" title="Millennium Volunteers">
<text>Millennium Volunteers (often abbreviated as MV) is a youth volunteering initiative in the UK, set up with public funding, and aimed at people aged between 14 and 24. The programme works to engage young people in a variety of volunteering opportunities, providing recognition through certificates and awards up to 200 hours. Originally operating across the UK, Millennium Volunteers is now only available in Northern Ireland and Wales, it was replaced in England in 2008 by vInspired and in Scotland in 2012 by the Saltire Award.

==MV across the UK==

In England, from 1 April 2007, the Millennium Volunteers scheme was taken over by the newly established charity &#x27;v&#x27;, who assumed management of the scheme, before replacing it in England with &#x27;vinsipred&#x27; in January 2008.

In Scotland, MV was rebranded as &#x27;The Saltire Awards&#x27; from April 2012. The Award is run by Volunteer Development Scotland (VDS) and includes a 500 hours award, which is not available in the rest of the UK.

In Wales, MV is run by the GwirVol initiative, the Welsh programme to encourage and promote youth volunteering, and from 2012 has been open to 14- to 25-year-olds. Organisations can apply for grants from GwirVol of up to £10,000 to run Millennium Volunteers programmes.

In Northern Ireland, the Millennium Volunteers programme is run by Volunteer Now, with the support of the Department of Education and the Youth Council for Northern Ireland. The programme is delivered through a network of charity, community and voluntary groups known as delivery partners, with young people taking part receiving certificates after completing 50, 100 and 200 hours of volunteering. As well as the main programme there is also a specific stream for volunteering in sport called GoldMark, and a Schools Award for second-level students.

Although the four countries of the UK now have their own version of MV, the Awards follow roughly the same principles and hours can be interchangeable between counties of the UK in some circumstances.

Millennium Volunteers were partnered with BTCV, a national charity whose resources were used to provide an MV service in some regions.

==The nine key principles==
* Sustained personal commitment 
* Community benefit
* Voluntary involvement 
* Inclusive
* Ownership by young people 
* Variety of opportunities 
* Partnership 
* Quality of volunteering opportunities 
* Recognition of achievements

==Activities==
Millennium Volunteers (MVs) can become involved with a wide variety of different activities, some examples include:
* helping to run a local scout troop
* working in a hospital
* creating a community garden
* conservation work
* classroom assistant in a school for disabled children
* sports leaders
* helping on trips with younger students
* Taking part in a Cadet program, Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force, Sea Cadets

The only requirement was that the activity was unpaid, it benefited the community in some way and that the organisation hosting the volunteer agreed to the 9 Key Principles.

==Rewards==
In the original MV programme, the organisation encouraged young people to work for the good of their community by offering two rewards that could be used as proof of the hard work they have done. The first reward was given on the completion of 100 hours of community work, and an Award of Excellence upon completion of 200 hours. An award for 200+hours was also available. The 200 hours Award was signed by a member of government - for instance, in Wales the Award of Excellence is signed by the First Minister of Wales.

There have been several developments to these arrangements. Wales and Northern Ireland introduced a 50 hours award in 2008 and then a special award for sports volunteering linked to the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2010–11. In Northern Ireland the sports award is called GoldMark and in Wales it is MV50 Sport. Additionally, in Scotland there is a 500 hours award available.

Following the creation of &#x27;vinspired&#x27;, V withdrew the 200 hours Award in England and introduced a 25 and 50 hours award instead and made the maximum award for 100 hours of volunteering.</text><links>

<doc id="1224986" wikidata="Q7076006" url="?curid=1224986" title="Ocean Grove, Victoria">
<text>Ocean Grove is a town in Victoria, Australia, located on the Bellarine Peninsula. At the 2016 census, Ocean Grove had a population of 14,165.

==History==
In 1869, American Methodists established a permanent religious camp community on the coast at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, in the United States of America. It was so successful that they decided to spread their camps overseas, including to Australia. Following a collaboration with the Victorian Methodists, an initial camp was set up near Point Lonsdale. By 1882 they needed to acquire a larger area, so they could establish their Australian Ocean Grove community.

The site chosen was on the eastern side of the mouth of the Barwon River, overlooking Bass Strait.

In 1887, Charles James and James Grigg purchased, surveyed and subdivided land into 2,500 blocks bearing the covenant &quot;no part of the above Land shall be used for the Manufacture or Sale of Malted Spirituous, or Vinous Liquors&quot;. Due to this covenant, no bars or public houses could sell liquor within the town limits. The Ocean Grove Coffee Palace was built for the Methodist and Temperance Society, the first church service was held on 1 January 1888, and the population was such that a post office opened on 14 September 1888.

In 1927, the town was linked by the Barwon Heads Bridge to Barwon Heads on the other side of the river, previous access being by rowboat.

Many streets were named after important people in the Methodist community, while the local youth camp was run by the Methodist (later Uniting) Church from the 1920s until 1996.

In 2014, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) ruled that the liquor ban was no longer enforceable. The township now has a number of bars that can legally serve alcohol.

===Collendina===
Collendina is a small section of Ocean Grove. When the town of Ocean Grove was established it was a Methodist town, and it was the ruling of the Methodists that it would remain a dry town. Because Ocean Grove was free of alcohol outlets, the town of Collendina grew up around the Collendina pub and caravan park just outside the Ocean Grove boundary. Eventually the two towns merged to form one urban area. The prohibition was officially lifted in Ocean Grove in 2006, although many cafes and restaurants were already beginning to serve alcoholic drinks.
==Today==
Now the largest town on the Bellarine Peninsula, Ocean Grove has the largest shopping centre on the peninsula. Only a few blocks from the beach, it is popular with tourists and locals alike. In 2005 a new shopping centre was built in the Collendina area, allowing the locals to shop at both Coles and Woolworths supermarkets.

Ocean Grove has a resident population of about 12,000 which, during the school summer holidays, swells to four times this number as tourists from Melbourne, Geelong, interstate, and overseas flock in. The area offers surf beaches, fishing, kayaking, canoeing, bushwalking swimming and other outdoor activities. The Ocean Grove Nature Reserve preserves some remnant native woodland and contains walking tracks.

Significant infrastructure development in Ocean Grove during 2008-2009 has resulted in two soccer pitches, indoor swimming complex complete with a 25m pool and a four-star Skate Park with Bowl suitable for boards, blades and bikes, and a gym. 

While tourism makes the largest contribution to the local economy, during the slower months a larger proportion of local income is derived from orchards, fruit and vegetable growers, and the local wineries.

One of the local newspapers is the Ocean Grove Voice.

In December 2019 the Kingston Village shopping complex located on Grubb Road opened to the public. It is the biggest shopping complex on the peninsula.

==Sport==
The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Bellarine Football League.

The Ocean Grove Soccer Club competes in the Geelong Regional Football Association.

Golfers play at the course of the Ocean Grove Golf Club on Guthridge Street.

The town hosts a Bi-annual Geelong gaming competition with teams from around the greater Geelong region competing for a minor cash prize and qualification for the state competition held in Broadmeadows.

<text>Raymond John Paul Parer (18 February 1894 – 4 July 1967) was an Australian aviator.

Parer was born in South Melbourne, Victoria, the second of nine children of a Spanish-born caterer, Michael Parer, and his Australian wife Maria (née Carolin). He was educated initially by an educator on King Island, then at Mentone College, Melbourne, with his final two years from 1920 at St Stanislaus College, Bathurst, New South Wales, and Xavier College, Melbourne. He developed an interest in aviation and mechanics at an early age, and served a motor engineering apprenticeship with Broadbribb Brothers in Melbourne.

He enlisted in the Australian Flying Corps on 2 November 1916, initially as a mechanic, but was soon accepted to train as a pilot, as an acting sergeant. From February to May 1917, he trained on box kites at the Central Flying School at Point Cook. He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 1 June 1917 and was sent to England to complete his training, qualifying as a pilot and being promoted lieutenant on 15 February 1918. He served as a test and ferry pilot with the Royal Air Force Central Despatch Pool, being twice recommended for the Air Force Cross.

After the end of World War I, the Australian government offered a prize of £10,000 for the first flight from England to Australia. He paired with John McIntosh, and, although leaving well after the event had been won, they arrived in Darwin on 2 August 1920. Their aircraft was an Airco DH-9, and theirs was the only other entrant to successfully complete the race. It was the first single-engined aircraft to fly from England to Australia. On 31 August, at Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne, then the Australian capital, they handed a bottle of Peter Dawson whisky that had travelled with them from England to Australian prime minister Billy Hughes.

He and McIntosh were awarded the Air Force Cross for this feat on 23 November 1920, as well as £500 each. The journey was detailed in the book &quot;Flight and Adventures of Parer and McIntosh&quot; by Emily Charnwood.

Parer formed Parer&#x27;s Commercial Aviation Service in Melbourne. On 27 December 1920, he won the first Victorian Aerial Derby in a DH-4, setting a record which stood for a decade. His attempt at the first flight to encircle Australia, which he began from Melbourne on 21 October 1921 in an FE2b, ended in disaster when he crashed on take-off at Boulder, Western Australia on 7 February 1922. Disillusioned with aviation, he bought a garage on King Island in Bass Strait.

However, he later became a pioneer of aviation in New Guinea, one of the most hostile environments to operate an aircraft anywhere on earth. Aviation in the country at that time was chiefly involved with the gold mining industry, which was thriving in the 1920s. In November 1926, Parer set up the Bulolo Goldfields Aeroplane Service Ltd there, and was the first pilot to fly over the Owen Stanley Range. He spent fifteen years flying in New Guinea.

In 1934, he participated in the MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia, this time teamed with Geoff Hemsworth, flying a Fairey Fox. They departed on 20 October 1934, arriving at the destination, Melbourne, on 13 February 1935. Parer then returned to New Guinea. However the advent of World War II and the impending Japanese invasion of New Guinea in 1942 found him once again in military service, this time in the Royal Australian Air Force. Due to his health he was made a reservist, and since he could not fly he turned to the sea. He was an engineer aboard the &quot;Melanesia&quot;, which delivered supplies and undertook reconnaissance along New Guinea&#x27;s northern coastline.

After the war he purchased a ketch in Darwin, and embarked in pearl exploration in the Torres Strait. From 1949 to 1951, he skippered a barge for the Department of Works around the Papua New Guinea coast. He then worked as an engineer on tourist vessels around the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland. From 1956 to 1958, he returned to Papua New Guinea to work on boats in the oil exploration industry. He spent the last years of his life running two small farms at Mount Nebo, Queensland.

Parer married divorcee Ethel Blanche Jones on 30 December 1941. They were divorced on 8 May 1950 and he remarried to Mary Patricia Ross, but that marriage also ended in divorce. He had one son.

On 21 October 2023, Parer and John Cowe McIntosh were inducted into the Australian Aviation Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1225002" wikidata="Q901016" url="?curid=1225002" title="Polyelectrolyte">
<text>Polyelectrolytes are polymers whose repeating units bear an electrolyte group. Polycations and polyanions are polyelectrolytes. These groups dissociate in aqueous solutions (water), making the polymers charged. Polyelectrolyte properties are thus similar to both electrolytes (salts) and polymers (high molecular weight compounds) and are sometimes called polysalts. Like salts, their solutions are electrically conductive. Like polymers, their solutions are often viscous. Charged molecular chains, commonly present in soft matter systems, play a fundamental role in determining structure, stability and the interactions of various molecular assemblies. Theoretical approaches to describe their statistical properties differ profoundly from those of their electrically neutral counterparts, while technological and industrial fields exploit their unique properties. Many biological molecules are polyelectrolytes. For instance, polypeptides, glycosaminoglycans, and DNA are polyelectrolytes. Both natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in a variety of industries.

== Charge ==

Acids are classified as either weak or strong (and bases similarly may be either weak or strong). Similarly, polyelectrolytes can be divided into &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; types. A &quot;strong&quot; polyelectrolyte dissociates completely in solution for most reasonable pH values. A &quot;weak&quot; polyelectrolyte, by contrast, has a dissociation constant (pKa or pKb) in the range of ~2 to ~10, meaning that it will be partially dissociated at intermediate pH. Thus, weak polyelectrolytes are not fully charged in the solution, and moreover, their fractional charge can be modified by changing the solution pH, counter-ion concentration, or ionic strength.

The physical properties of polyelectrolyte solutions are usually strongly affected by this degree of ionization. Since the polyelectrolyte dissociation releases counter-ions, this necessarily affects the solution&#x27;s ionic strength, and therefore the Debye length. This, in turn, affects other properties, such as electrical conductivity.

When solutions of two oppositely charged polymers (that is, a solution of polycation and one of polyanion) are mixed, a bulk complex (precipitate) is usually formed. This occurs because the oppositely-charged polymers attract one another and bind together.

== Conformation ==

The conformation of any polymer is affected by a number of factors, notably the polymer architecture and the solvent affinity. In the case of polyelectrolytes, charge also has an effect. Whereas an uncharged linear polymer chain is usually found in a random conformation in solution (closely approximating a self-avoiding three-dimensional random walk), the charges on a linear polyelectrolyte chain will repel each other via double layer forces, which causes the chain to adopt a more expanded, rigid-rod-like conformation. The charges will be screened if the solution contains a great deal of added salt. Consequently, the polyelectrolyte chain will collapse to a more conventional conformation (essentially identical to a neutral chain in good solvent).

Polymer conformation affects many bulk properties (such as viscosity, turbidity, etc.). Although the statistical conformation of polyelectrolytes can be captured using variants of conventional polymer theory, it is, in general, quite computationally intensive to properly model polyelectrolyte chains, owing to the long-range nature of the electrostatic interaction.
Techniques such as static light scattering can be used to study polyelectrolyte conformation and conformational changes.

== Polyampholytes ==
Polyelectrolytes that bear both cationic and anionic repeat groups are called polyampholytes. The competition between the acid-base equilibria of these groups leads to additional complications in their physical behavior. These polymers usually only dissolve when sufficient added salt screens the interactions between oppositely charged segments. In the case of amphoteric macroporous hydrogels, the action of concentrated salt solution does not lead to the dissolution of polyampholyte material due to the covalent cross-linking of macromolecules. Synthetic 3-D macroporous hydrogels shows the excellent ability to adsorb heavy-metal ions in a wide range of pH from extremely diluted aqueous solutions, which can be later used as an adsorbent for purification of salty water All proteins are polyampholytes, as some amino acids tend to be acidic, while others are basic.

== Applications ==

Polyelectrolytes have many applications, mostly related to modifying flow and stability properties of aqueous solutions and gels. For instance, they can be used to destabilize a colloidal suspension and to initiate flocculation (precipitation). They can also be used to impart a surface charge to neutral particles, enabling them to be dispersed in aqueous solution. They are thus often used as thickeners, emulsifiers, conditioners, clarifying agents, and even drag reducers. They are used in water treatment and for oil recovery. Many soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics incorporate polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, they are added to many foods and to concrete mixtures (superplasticizer). Some of the polyelectrolytes that appear on food labels are pectin, carrageenan, alginates, and carboxymethyl cellulose. All but the last are of natural origin. Finally, they are used in various materials, including cement.

Because some of them are water-soluble, they are also investigated for biochemical and medical applications. There is currently much research on using biocompatible polyelectrolytes for implant coatings, controlled drug release, and other applications. Thus, recently, the biocompatible and biodegradable macroporous material composed of polyelectrolyte complex was described, where the material exhibited excellent proliferation of mammalian cells and muscle like soft actuators.

== Multilayers ==

Polyelectrolytes have been used in the formation of new types of materials known as polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs). These thin films are constructed using a layer-by-layer&quot; (LbL&quot;&#x27;) deposition technique. During LbL deposition, a suitable growth substrate (usually charged) is dipped back and forth between dilute baths of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolyte solutions. During each dip, a small amount of polyelectrolyte is adsorbed, and the surface charge is reversed, allowing the gradual and controlled build-up of electrostatically cross-linked films of polycation-polyanion layers. Scientists have demonstrated thickness control of such films down to the single-nanometer scale. LbL films can also be constructed by substituting charged species such as nanoparticles or clay platelets in place of or in addition to one of the polyelectrolytes. LbL deposition has also been accomplished using hydrogen bonding instead of electrostatics. For more information on multilayer creation, please see polyelectrolyte adsorption. 

An LbL formation of PEM (PSS-PAH (poly(allylamine) hydrochloride)) on a gold substrate can be seen in the Figure. The formation is measured using multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance to determine adsorption kinetics, layer thickness, and optical density.

The main benefits of PEM coatings are the ability to conformably coat objects (that is, the technique is not limited to coating flat objects), the environmental benefits of using water-based processes, reasonable costs, and the utilization of the particular chemical properties of the film for further modification, such as the synthesis of metal or semiconductor nanoparticles, or porosity phase transitions to create anti-reflective coatings, optical shutters, and superhydrophobic coatings.

== Bridging ==

If polyelectrolyte chains are added to a system of charged macroions (i.e., an array of DNA molecules), an interesting phenomenon called the polyelectrolyte bridging might occur. The term bridging interactions is usually applied to the situation where a single polyelectrolyte chain can adsorb to two (or more) oppositely charged macroions (e.g. DNA molecule) thus establishing molecular bridges and, via its connectivity, mediate attractive interactions between them.

At small macroion separations, the chain is squeezed in between the macroions and electrostatic effects in the system are completely dominated by steric effects – the system is effectively discharged. As we increase the macroion separation, we simultaneously stretch the polyelectrolyte chain adsorbed to them. The stretching of the chain gives rise to the above-mentioned attractive interactions due to the chain&#x27;s rubber elasticity.

Because of its connectivity, the behavior of the polyelectrolyte chain bears almost no resemblance to that of confined, unconnected ions.

== Polyacid ==

In polymer terminology, a polyacid is a polyelectrolyte composed of macromolecules containing acid groups on a substantial fraction of the constitutional units. Most commonly, the acid groups are , , or .

<text>The 2001 Taiwanese legislative election was held on 1 December 2001. All 225 seats of the Legislative Yuan were up for election: 168 elected by popular vote, 41 elected on the basis of the proportional representation based of the nationwide votes received by participating political parties, eight elected from overseas Chinese constituencies on the basis of the proportion of nationwide votes received by participating political parties, eight elected by popular vote among the Taiwanese aboriginal populations. Members served three year terms from February 1, 2002 to February 1, 2005.

== Background ==
The first national election to be held after Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s victory in the 2000 presidential election, the election resulted for the first time in the Kuomintang (KMT) losing its majority and President Chen&#x27;s Democratic Progressive Party to emerging as the largest party in the legislature. However, the Pan-Blue Coalition developed between the Kuomintang, the People First Party and the New Party, enabled the Chinese reunificationist and conservative opposition to muster a slim majority over the pro-Taiwan independence Pan-Green Coalition formed between the Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union. This resulted in much of President Chen&#x27;s agenda being derailed or deadlocked for the following three years.

==Results==
The KMT lost its majority for the first time, losing 46 seats and falling to 68 seats. The largest party had become the DPP with 87 seats, followed by the KMT, and the PFP with 46 seats. Various parties and independents held the remainder. The New Party which lost all of its seat except the one seat on Quemoy while the newly formed Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) captured 13 seats, with independents holding on to 10 seats. Overall the pan-blue opposition got 115 seats, while the government pan-green got 100 seats. The pan-blue remained majority.

Part of the KMT&#x27;s loss could be attributed to defections to both the People First Party and Taiwan Solidarity Union. The People First Party formed by James Soong and his supporters after the 2000 presidential elections. Soong had been expelled from the KMT after launching an independent bid for the presidency and narrowly lost the race to Chen Shui-bian. The Taiwan Solidarity Union was formed by supporters of former President and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who took the title of &quot;spiritual leader&quot; in the party. For this, Lee was also expelled from the KMT. Though the both offshoots of the Kuomintang, the People First Party advocated a more conservative position than the KMT while the Taiwan Solidarity Union took on a radical pro-independence stance. After Lee&#x27;s expulsion, the KMT and PFP had a warming of relations and cooperated in the election. The more moderate pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party cooperated with the Taiwan Solidarity Union likewise, leading to the formation of the pan-blue and pan-green coalitions.

The KMT&#x27;s loss in the election could also be attributed partly to the single non-transferable vote scheme in place. Though the DPP won 40% of the seats they only polled 36% of the vote because of the inability of the KMT, PFP, and New Party to coordinate their electoral strategies. Despite winning a plurality of votes in Hualien, vote-splitting between KMT candidates led to the election of one DPP and one PFP candidate instead. This led to more stringent vote allocation strategies by pan-blue in 2004, which helped prevent pan-green from gaining a majority.

<text>The 2006 Italian general election was held on 9 and 10 April 2006. Romano Prodi, leader of the centre-left coalition The Union, narrowly defeated the incumbent Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms. Initial exit polls suggested a victory for Prodi, but the results narrowed as the count progressed. On 11 April 2006, Prodi declared victory; Berlusconi never conceded defeat and an ensuing dispute formed.

Preliminary results showed The Union leading the House of Freedoms in the Chamber of Deputies, with 340 seats to 277, thanks to obtaining a majority bonus (actual votes were distributed 49.81% to 49.74%). One more seat is allied with The Union (Aosta Valley) and 7 more seats in the foreign constituency. The House of Freedoms had secured a slight majority of Senate seats elected within Italy (155 seats to 154), but The Union won 4 of the 6 seats allocated to voters outside Italy, giving them control of both chambers.

On 19 April 2006, Italy&#x27;s Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that Prodi had indeed won the election, winning control of the Chamber of Deputies by only 24,755 votes out of more than 38 million votes cast, and winning 158 seats in the Senate to 156 for Berlusconi&#x27;s coalition. Even so, Berlusconi refused to concede defeat, claiming unproven electoral fraud.

== Electoral campaign ==
During the election campaign, a political battle began between Romano Prodi, who led the centre-left coalition The Union and had been President of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004 and Prime Minister of Italy from 1996 to 1998. On the other hand, Silvio Berlusconi led the centre-right House of Freedoms; Berlusconi had been the incumbent Prime Minister since the 2001 general election, and had previously served as Prime Minister also in 1994 and 1995.

=== House of Freedoms ===
The House of Freedoms was the coalition supporting the incumbent government led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and mainly included the same parties as in the previous general election.

The New Italian Socialist Party (NPSI), a small social-democratic party composed of former members of the late Italian Socialist Party and led by former 1980s and 1990s minister Gianni De Michelis, which was part of the Berlusconi III Cabinet as a minister without portfolio, suffered a split on its last national congress (21 to 23 October 23, 2005), with a left-wing faction, led by Bobo Craxi, son of the late Bettino Craxi, who decided to immediately leave the House of Freedoms and unilaterally elected Craxi himself as new party leader. The NPSI contested the election with a joint list with the Christian Democracy for Autonomies.

As for the candidate who led the coalition into the general election, Berlusconi experienced an actual loss of support from Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), who asked for a return of the electoral law to a proportional system (which would most likely favour them) and a primary election to formally decide the alliance&#x27;s candidate for Prime Minister. When the party list representation system was restored (albeit a form very different from the UDC proposal) and Marco Follini, critic of several reforms imposed by Berlusconi on the whole coalition, resigned from the UDC secretaryship, the possibility of a change of leadership inside the House of Freedoms was significantly reduced. On 27 October 2005, Lorenzo Cesa was appointed as new UDC secretary, becoming the successor of Follini himself. The coalition announced a &quot;three-forwards&quot; system, meaning that the Prime Ministerial candidate will be the political leader, among Casini, Fini and Berlusconi, whose party will win most votes. Since Berlusconi&#x27;s party was known to be by far the largest one, it was understood that Berlusconi was the actual candidate.

One event which caused heavy criticism from the opposition was the support, sought and obtained by Berlusconi, of a number of fascist movements and parties, notably the Social Alternative of Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of the former dictator of Italy, and Luca Romagnoli, a holocaust denier. Supporters of Berlusconi responded to this pointing to the presence in The Union of two communist parties, which had among their candidates anarchist activist Francesco Caruso and a transgender person, Vladimir Luxuria.

=== The Union ===
The Olive Tree coalition, expression of the Italian centre-left, was expanded as The Union, and led for the election by former Prime Minister and former President of the European Commission Romano Prodi, who had already beaten Berlusconi in the 1996 general election. Prodi&#x27;s candidacy was confirmed by a national primary election, held on 16 October 2005. The former coalition was enlarged in order to cover the whole ensemble of Italian centre-left to left-wing factions.

The Rose in the Fist was officially founded on 25 September 2005, when the Italian Radicals, a libertarian-influenced party, officially declared an alliance with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) in the form of a confederation, with explicit references to the politics of Tony Blair, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Loris Fortuna, an Italian politician in the 1970s who became famous for his laicist proposals, and is considered the father of the law on divorce. This confederation immediately caused a stir for not having signed the political platform of The Union, being the only centre-left party not to do that; the Rose in the Fist, represented by Emma Bonino in the final platform meeting, in fact protested about insufficient mentions of social issues such as legalisation of civil unions. The Socialists, led by Bobo Craxi, who were the breakaway left wing of the New Italian Socialist Party which emerged the House of Freedoms, was supposed to join the Rose in the Fist confederation, but instead reorganised itself in a single party, which however failed to get over the 2% of national votes. However, Bobo Craxi was able to enter in the Lower House, as he was one of the leading candidates for The Olive Tree in Lombardy.

The Union is also supported by a number of minor parties and movements, although of those only the Pensioners&#x27; Party has any elected representation (1 Member of European Parliament).

== Main coalitions and parties ==
== Debates ==
For some time, Silvio Berlusconi had challenged Romano Prodi to a debate on national television. Prodi, however, said he would accept only if certain rules had been set. Possibly because he thought he was behind in the polls, Berlusconi saw the debate as a chance to turn the tables, and accused Prodi of fleeing from him. It is notable that, in the 2001 elections, it was Berlusconi who refused to meet the centre-left candidate, Francesco Rutelli.

Two televised debates were set by the &quot;Parliamentary Committee of Inspection on RAI&quot;, which had the goal of ensuring equal treatment for the two political sides. However, Prodi contested the deliberation of this Committee, which allowed Berlusconi to also hold a final televised speech after the debates as Prime Minister. Prodi refused to participate in any debate until this final speech had been cancelled. The issue was resolved on 3 March, when Berlusconi finally agreed to cancel the final speech.

The debates lasted about 90 minutes each, did not include commercials, and had a preset time for each answer and each reply, and the obligation to film only the speaking person at any given time. The candidates were also forbidden to bring any kind of notes with them, even though they could write some down during the debate, and no audience was allowed to participate. This set of rules was very unusual in Italian political talk shows, where politicians usually interrupt each other, talk simultaneously and for as long as they can hold the word. Questions to candidates are posted by two journalists from the Italian press: the moderator himself was not allowed to ask any questions, but only to present the debate and guarantee respect of the rules. At the end of the debates, the candidates are allowed to make a final statement of 3 minutes.

The first televised debate, held on 14 March, was broadcast live on Rai Uno, and moderated by Clemente Mimun, Director of &quot;TG1&quot;. It featured questions from journalists Roberto Napoletano of &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; and Marcello Sorgi of &quot;La Stampa&quot;. It was watched by over 16 million people, a record for a political TV show. During his final speech, Berlusconi, who often overran his intervention times, attacked the rules of the debate, in his opinion too strict, whereas Prodi praised them, pointing out the fact that they are used in US debates this way, as well. Some observers commented that Berlusconi had been disappointing in this debate, scribbling nervously while he was talking and at a point confusing Iran and Iraq; while all politicians claimed their candidate had won the debate, it was generally agreed that Berlusconi had not dealt a strong blow to Prodi.

The second debate, moderated by Bruno Vespa, an Italian journalist and anchorman, was held on April 3 and broadcast live on Rai Uno, featuring questions from Napoletano and Sorgi (same journalists of the first debate). It was dominated by the economic proposals and was more intense, with much stronger tones between Prodi and Berlusconi. In this debate, Berlusconi had the possibility of making the final 3-minute statement: in this time, he delivered his &quot;surprise blow&quot; proposing the abolition of ICI, a local tax on real estate whose money belongs to local city councils.

Later on, it turned out that Berlusconi&#x27;s proposal was not completely agreed upon in the rest of the House of Freedoms, and Prodi, immediately after the debate, noted &quot;about ICI, I want to know what the centre-right mayors think about&quot;.

== Platforms ==

=== The Union ===
After a long discussion, the centre-left coalition released its official platform on 10 February 2006, and presented it to the public the next day. However, the Rose in the Fist refused to sign it in, because it did not explicitly include some issues, such as civil unions and LGBT rights. The platform has been criticised by the House of Freedoms because of its 281-page length.

A reduced, more readable, version of the official political platform was released by the coalition, in order to answer the critics from the centre-right coalition.

The main points of the centre-left platform were:
*More safety, by moving police resources from immigration and escort issues to the control of the territory;
*Controlled immigration and promotion of legal ways to immigrate in Italy;
*A quicker and more reliable judicial system;
*Full condemnation and fight of dodging and regularisation of concealed labour;
*More integration with the European Union;
*Recognition of rights for civil, unmarried couples;
*Immediate withdrawal of the Italian troops in Iraq;
*Numerical restraint and regulation of the typologies of flexible labour;
*Reduction of taxes on work by 5% (often referred to as the &quot;fiscal wedge&quot;), to be financed by increased policing activity against tax dodgers;
*Increase in taxes on temporary work positions to encourage permanent employment.

=== House of Freedoms ===
The platform of the House of Freedoms was released on 25 February. It was 22 pages long, and it was defined as the continuance of the first five years of centre-right government. It is different by the &quot;contract with Italians&quot; (just five basic points) which characterised the 2001 general election. It was criticised as &quot;vague&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;.

The main points of the centre-right platform were:
*Increase of fiscal autonomy for Regions (, fiscal federalism);
*Realisation of the so-called (big works), notably the Strait of Messina Bridge;
*Support for smaller and family companies, and the &quot;Made in Italy&quot; export goods business;
*Tax reduction;
*Consolidation of relationships with the USA and reaffirmation of the commitment to the European Union;
*Defence of the values of family as based on marriage;
*Rise of legal penalties for criminal offences;
*Keeping up with the current politics for creating jobs, especially for the young Italians and the women;
*Restrictions on immigration

== Opinion polling ==

According to the opinion polls released, mainly commissioned for national newspapers, magazines and TV stations, The Union was clearly leading the race to the general election. The three surveys which show a majority of votes for the House of Freedoms were all commissioned by Berlusconi&#x27;s party Forza Italia. Notably, the surveys of Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland, a U.S. research firm, were commissioned by Berlusconi because he claimed the national surveys to be politically biased.

According to the Italian law, it is forbidden to publish any opinion polling in the 15 days which precede the election (25 March, in this case).

The final result (49.8% Union vs 49.7% House of Freedoms) was about 3% different from almost all polls (including all the exit polls) reducing the expected 5% gap between the coalition to a difference of about 0.1%. On Italian TV some tried to explain this discrepancy claiming that some House of Freedoms voters were ashamed to admit that they planned to vote for them. Others claimed that the last week of electoral campaign, dominated by Berlusconi&#x27;s proposal of cutting ICI and by the media&#x27;s insistence on the alleged new taxes advocated by The Union, persuaded a large number of Italians, usually uninterested to politics, to cast a vote for the House of Freedoms.

== Political issues ==

=== Election date ===

In July 2005, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi asked current PM Silvio Berlusconi about the opportunity for an early election for the first half of April 2006, in order to prevent a big political deadlock (the mandate of President Ciampi himself would be over in May 2006 and a newly elected government was not likely be in office within three weeks). Berlusconi however refused the deal, claiming he would stay in office until the due date of his term.

But, on 18 October, Berlusconi announced that the election would be held on 9 April 2006, eventually following the suggestions from President Ciampi. Berlusconi also announced that the next administrative elections (which include the mayoral elections of Rome, Milan and Naples) will be held in May, the day after Romano Prodi had asked to vote for all elections the same day, in April. Berlusconi stated this was due to his fear that good government by centre-left mayors could favour the centre-left in the general election. Critics say holding all elections on the same day could save millions of euros in public expenditure.

=== law ===
One of the main topics that was relevant for this general election was the law. Its name, in Latin, means &#x27;equal treatment&#x27;; a special law which guarantees all the main majority and opposition political forces to have equal media treatment, in terms of times and spaces, and, furthermore, denies political commercials for TV and radio outside some dedicated transmissions.

Berlusconi had declared several times that he wants the law to be either repealed or at least changed in a much lighter way. Critics and opponents said that Berlusconi&#x27;s willingness to have the law abolished were dictated by his almost complete control of 6 channels (his family holding company controls Mediaset, which broadcasts three national private channels, and controls indirectly, as Head of Government, the three RAI public broadcasting channels).

In his latter government years, Berlusconi attempted to accelerate his desires; however UDC, who is part of the Berlusconi government, declared several times its opposition to either abolish or change the law, with secretary Lorenzo Cesa, after his election as party leader, who pointed out his refusal of any change of the law.

The law however did not prevent Berlusconi from using his TV channels of Mediaset, and even SMS via cellphones, to manage to get more votes. During the election day Berlusconi&#x27;s channels aired a lot of messages to remind people who were watching his TV channels to use their vote together with spots saying &quot;Mediaset gives you everything without asking for anything in return&quot;. While these spots didn&#x27;t break the par condicio law, it was broken by some of the journalists (especially Emilio Fede, well known for his political ideas) of the Berlusconi&#x27;s channels and in March and April 2006, the &quot;Autorità per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni&quot; fined twice his privately owned channels for violation of the &quot;par condicio&quot; law, the biggest fine to date (300,000 €).

=== Tax breaks ===
Before winning the 2001 general election and becoming Prime Minister of Italy, Berlusconi signed in a TV show a &quot;Contract with Italians&quot;, where he promised, if elected, to fulfil at least four of the five points included in it. One of the main points regarded a tax break for income levels, whereas The Olive Tree policy was essentially to maintain a progressive taxation system.

The generalised tax break was somewhat enacted in 2005, and included in the last Financial Measure. The opposition blamed Berlusconi for doing the tax break in one of the worst economic periods for the country, with no coverage for the resulting debt, and accused Berlusconi&#x27;s allies of accepting the tax break in return for better power positions; during the negotiations for the Financial Measure, the National Alliance leader, and, at that date, vice-premier, Gianfranco Fini, was moved to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and UDC leader Marco Follini, who had no ministerial role before that date, was chosen to replace Fini.

In the electoral campaign, Berlusconi and the whole centre-right coalition almost daily criticised the left, alleging that Prodi would increase taxes if elected, pointing out the centre-left proposal to have a 5% cut of the tax wedge.

Taxes became the main topic for the end of the electoral campaign, with Berlusconi citing Prodi would reintroduce the inheritance tax, abrogated in 2001, and increase the tax system on treasury bills (BOT, CCT) and would tax stockmarket trading. Prodi pointed out the fact that he would reintroduce the inheritance tax only for the very rich people, and would not increase the taxes on treasury bills.

=== Foreign reputation ===

A good friend of George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin, Berlusconi supported the American invasion of Iraq, and, during the Italian EU presidency, suggested to Chairman of the PES Group in the European Parliament Martin Schulz, during a talk, a role of kapo (concentration-camp inmate appointed as supervisor) for a hypothetical movie, claiming he would be &quot;perfect&quot; for the role. When Berlusconi entered the Strasburg Parliament he was welcomed with posters in various languages addressing him as &quot;Godfather of Europe&quot;, explicitly referring to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s cinematic series about the mafia, without respecting his high institutional role as EU Council president. Afterwards Mr Berlusconi exploded at the insisting questions of MP Schulz. This diplomatic incident cooled down the Italy-Germany foreign relations for a period. Eventually a phone call between the Prime Minister and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder put an end to the dispute.

In 2001 Berlusconi declared Western civilisation to be &quot;superior to Islam&quot;, which he was very much criticised for. But in particular the international English-speaking press, such as &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, criticized Berlusconi&#x27;s work. Several times, before and after his election as prime minister, the weekly worldwide magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; accused Berlusconi of being essentially &quot;unfit to lead Italy&quot;.

=== New voting rights for Italians living abroad ===
For the first time in Italian history, Italian citizens living abroad were able to vote by postal ballot (without having to &quot;physically&quot; return to Italy to cast their vote) for 12 deputies and 6 senators who will represent them in the Italian Parliament, an unusual system that was supported by Silvio Berlusconi and promoted by Mirko Tremaglia. These parliamentary seats are organised into four constituencies (Europe, North &amp; Central America, Latin America, and Africa/Asia/Oceania). Candidates must live in their respective constituencies.

Forty-two percent of eligible voters abroad participated in the elections. Prodi&#x27;s The Union managed to secure 4 of the 6 Senate seats, while Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia and an Independent candidate each gained 1 of the remaining 2 seats, aiding Prodi in gaining a majority in the Italian Senate. In the House of Deputies, 7 seats went to The Union, 4 to Berlusconi&#x27;s coalition, and one to an Independent candidate. In North America, candidates from Toronto and Chicago were elected to the House of Deputies while the candidate from New York City was elected to the Senate.

Berlusconi claimed, in challenging the election results, that there were irregularities in the vote abroad. The result of the vote may have been influenced by the fact that numerous right-wing parties put forward candidates in the constituencies abroad, while there were few centre-left candidates, thereby splitting the centre-right vote. This tactical error may be explained through the novelty of the vote abroad.

=== Voting rights for Italians living abroad prior to 2006 ===
Italian citizens living outside of Italy have always had the &quot;De Jure&quot; &quot;right&quot; to vote in all referendums and elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate). However until late 2001, any citizen wishing to vote, was required to &quot;physically&quot; return to the city or town in Italy where he or she was registered on the electoral roll. The &quot;only&quot; exception to this rule was for the Italian elections to the european parliament in which voters could cast their ballot at their nearest consulate but only if they had their residence in one of the other 14 European Union nations.

Until 2001 the Italian Republic offered citizens living abroad a free return train journey to their home town in Italy in order to vote, however the portion of the train journey that was free of charge was &quot;only on Italian soil&quot;. Any costs incurred in getting from their place of residence abroad to the Italian border had to be covered by the citizen wanting to vote, therefore a free return train journey was hardly an incentive for the large Italian communities living as far away as in the United States, Argentina or Australia. For this reason very few Italians abroad made use of this right to vote, unless they lived in cities and towns that bordered to Italy such as in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. Various Italian minorities living abroad (notably in the United States) protested frequently at this lack of political representation especially if they paid taxes on property owned in Italy.

After numerous years of petitioning and fierce debate, the Italian Parliament, in late 2001, finally passed a constitutional law allowing Italian citizens living abroad to vote in elections in Italy by postal ballot. The change was the result of a thirty-year struggle to recognise the rights and special interests of Italians who have migrated abroad but retained their Italian identity.

Italians wishing to excise this right must first register their residence abroad with their relevant consulate.

=== Constitutional reform ===
During the last few months of 2004, the House of Freedoms coalition proposed a large reform of the current Italian Constitution, which was formulated in 1948. It proposes several changes to the current political system: it reduces the number of MPs from about 950 to 750, it gives more power to the prime minister (no longer called president of the council), there will be no possibility to express a vote of no confidence against the prime minister without indicating his successor (similar to Germany&#x27;s constructive vote of no confidence); it puts an end to the necessity of a law being approved by both Chambers, attributing a clear competence to each of them; it gives more power to the regions, with several references to devolution, the main programme point of the Northern League, still guaranteeing, according to the new version of article 127, the national interest, which had been cancelled by the previous reform of the left.
The Italian Constitution prescribes that both chambers must accept every modification to the constitution twice within three months, and, if it passes with less than two thirds of the votes at the second scrutiny, a national referendum on the modification can be held (the reform will make it always possible to call such a referendum). Since the centre-left opposition opposed to the new constitutional reform, describing it as &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;separatist&quot;, and &quot;antidemocratic&quot;, the first procedural step, that is, the approval by the Chamber of Deputies, was done successfully in October 2004, but with less than two-thirds of the lower-house votes, making possible the confirmative referendum. The second favourable polling, in Senate, was done in March 2005, whereas the third one occurred on October 20. During the third polling, former UDC leader Marco Follini announced he would abstain from the final vote, not support anymore the constitutional reform, followed by his party fellow Bruno Tabacci.

On November 17, the Senate approved the constitutional reform in its final instance; Northern League leader Umberto Bossi attended the discussion and the voting, returning to the Parliament, even if just as spectator, after his illness. During the vote, Domenico Fisichella announced his opposition to the reform, and his immediate resignation from the party, going against the party line about the issue. Italian MPs quite easily change party and even coalition: in the legislature between 1996 and 2001 15% of MPs did so.

The House of Freedoms&#x27; proposal of constitutional reform has been done in a unilateral way - no agreement with the opposition, whereas the current Italian Constitution was written after World War II by all the national political forces (except the fascists), ranging from Liberals, to Christian Democrats, to Socialists, to Communists and others. According to the House of Freedom, this policy was adopted in order to correct the constitutional reform approved by the former centre-left majority in 2001 (Constitutional law 3/2001) with the same modus - no agreement with the opposition. However, the new reform deeply modifies constitutional system of Italy, while the 2001 reform just partially modified a section of the Constitution.

The national referendum, requested by the centre-left opposition and a number of associations and regions - even by the centre-right ruled Lombardy, has been kept on 25–26 June 2006 and it has been concluded with the refusal of the constitutional reform by 61.32% of voting.

=== 2005 regional elections ===
On 3 and 4 April 2005, regional elections were held in 13 Italian regions (the election in Basilicata was put off for two weeks because of irregularities). The final result actually reversed the political scenario of Italy, with the opposition centre-left coalition The Union winning in 11 regions, while the governing centre-right coalition House of Freedoms maintaining only two of the eight regions they were ruling before the election. These results have brought some right-wing members, including vice-premier Marco Follini, to ask for early national election.

=== Centre-left primary election ===
On 16 October 2005, a primary election was held to officially declare the one and only candidate for the centre-left coalition &quot;The Union&quot;. Over four million voters have participated to the election.

Major candidate Romano Prodi, who has been one of the main supporters of the primary election, gained a clear win, obtaining about 75% of the votes and defeating Communist Refoundation Party leader Fausto Bertinotti, Green Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, former magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, Catholic centrist Clemente Mastella, independent candidate Ivan Scalfarotto and far-left candidate Simona Panzino. The election was also opened to non-Italian official residents, even if they will not be eligible to vote for the general election.

=== Economic issues ===
Italy was the only European country in which there is an almost-zero rate of growth in economy, and one of the highest debts in the whole EU, which brought Berlusconi to ask successfully to have the Treaty of Maastricht parameters relaxed. This led to several critics of the Berlusconi&#x27;s policy on economy, strictly linked to the work of the Italian Ministry of Economy of Giulio Tremonti, which was forced to resign in 2004 after heavy protests from parties of his own coalition, especially the National Alliance, and returned to his previous cabinet position one year later, following the resignation of Domenico Siniscalco; Tremonti&#x27;s work for trying to fill the cash deficit was often based on amnesties for infringement of tax and building regulations. Prodi and the centre-left often criticised that facet of the Italian centre-right.

=== Job security ===
The regulation of temporary employment was first introduced as &quot;pacchetto Treu&quot; during the 1996–2001 centre-left government. It was then changed by Minister of Labour Roberto Maroni in 2003, introducing a high number of temporary labour forms and made temporary labour cheaper than permanent.

The centre-left heavily criticised the current law, claiming it has damaged the future of the younger people. More recently, Prodi defined the current labour law as &quot;much worse than French CPE&quot;.

The centre-left has proposed to put temporary and permanent job costs on the same level, contain the number of temporary labour forms, and regulate internships.

== Electoral system ==
Since 1994 and 2001 general elections, Italy had a mixed electoral system, with 75% of the seats assigned through a plurality voting system, and 25% through a proportional one.

The Italian Chamber of Deputies has 630 seats, the Senate 315 (exactly half).

=== Approval of a new voting system ===
A white paper for a proportional-only electoral system was presented to the Chamber of Deputies on 13 September 2005, only seven months before the 2006 general election. This reform, strongly backed by the centrist Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), proposed a 4% threshold before a party gained any seats, and a majority bonus of at least 340 seats for the winning coalition, the total votes for each coalition being the sum of the votes of those coalition parties which had won at least 4% of the national votes. The new proposal was approved by parliament.

An electoral survey published on 15 September 2005 by the national left newspaper &quot;La Repubblica&quot; claimed that, with the initial proposal of electoral reform become law, the House of Freedoms would win the next elections 340–290, even if they won only 45% of votes and the opposition coalition The Union won 50% because The Union also includes several small parties with less than 4% of national votes. This could have been avoided if the small opposition parties ran on a common ticket. Aim of this bill of reform was to reduce the number of parties, and particularly the moderate centre-left would have taken advantage in respect to the smaller radical left parties.

The UDC, commenting on the proposal, asked for the abolition of the 4% cut-off clause, whereas the National Alliance did not show any favour to this attempt of reform, with its leader Gianfranco Fini claiming to want first to vote for the constitutional reform, and then for the new voting system, on condition that the 4% cut-off were not repealed.

This proposal of law was strongly questioned by the opposition coalition, who defined it an &quot;attempted coup&quot;. Opposition leader Romano Prodi said it was &quot;totally unacceptable&quot;. Several newspapers politically oriented to the left nicknamed the electoral system proposal by the House of Freedoms as &quot;, after &quot; (Italian for &quot;fraud&quot;) and the &quot;, (from Sergio Mattarella), the most common name for the previous Italian electoral law (there is a recent custom to nickname new electoral systems by a somewhat Latinised version of the name of the lawmaker; another one is the system used in regional elections, the so-called &quot; from Pinuccio Tatarella).

Notably, some smaller opposition parties, such as Communist Refoundation Party and Union of Democrats for Europe (UDEUR), supported a proportional electoral law; nevertheless, they declared they were against an electoral reform by this parliament because the current law would be changed too close to the 2006 general election.

The Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi had previously been a strong supporter of the plurality-based electoral law; in 1995, talking about his coalition, he defined the plurality principle as &quot;our religion&quot;.

A modified version of the first proposal, this time with a 2% threshold for entering parliament and without vote of preference for candidates but still without the support of the opposition, was presented to the Chamber of Deputies. The voting count started on 11 October 2005; the lower house of the Italian Parliament then approved the electoral reform on 14 October. The new electoral was then eventually approved on December 16, 2005, and countersigned by President Ciampi on 23 December 2005.

Roberto Calderoli, the main author of this electoral reform, defined this law &quot;a rascality&quot; (using the mildly vulgar term &quot;&quot;). Ironically, the new electoral law allowed Prodi to count on a large majority in the Chamber and to obtain majority in the Senate, where the House of Freedoms had more votes (49.88% vs. 49.18% for The Union).

== Vote count controversy ==
Although The Union led initial exit polls and was quickly expected to win the election, the gap with House of Freedoms narrowed as the votes were tabulated. The initial results released by the Interior Ministry showed that Prodi had won the Chamber of Deputies by 25,204 votes, and Prodi declared victory on 11 April. Berlusconi, however, refused to concede, requesting a recount on 43,028 Chamber ballots and 39,822 Senate ballots. Berlusconi also claimed problems with the votes from Italian citizens abroad, which were critical in giving The Union a majority in the Senate. Five ballot boxes were also found on the streets in Rome after the election. On 14 April, however, the Interior Ministry announced that there had been a mistake in the report of the number of ballots to be rechecked. Only 2,131 Chamber ballots and 3,135 Senate ballots merited re-examination (reducing the total number of disputed ballots from the over 80,000 initially reported to just over 5,000). The result of this check added equally a few hundred votes to each coalition. Analysts also believed that the vote from abroad was so overwhelmingly in favour of The Union that the election would be highly unlikely to be overturned in Berlusconi&#x27;s favour.

The last ruling of the supreme court (&quot;Corte di Cassazione&quot;) on 19 April 2006 stated that Prodi won the election by 24,755 votes.

<doc id="1225061" wikidata="Q3580435" url="?curid=1225061" title="Mamdouh Habib">
<text>Mamdouh Habib (born 3 June 1955) is an Egyptian and Australian citizen with dual nationality, best known for having been held for more than three years by the United States as an enemy combatant, by both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and military authorities. He was sent by extraordinary rendition from Pakistan to Egypt after his arrest. He was held the longest at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as an enemy combatant. Finally released without charges in January 2005, Habib struggled to have his account of his experiences believed, as he alleged he had been tortured by the CIA, Egyptians, and US military, at times with Australian intelligence officers present. For some time, each of the governments denied his allegations, but they have gradually been confirmed.

Arrested after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 during a trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Habib was interrogated there by Pakistani and United States CIA agents before being shipped to Egypt, where he was held for six months and interrogated under torture. The CIA transferred him back to a black site in Afghanistan for more torture and interrogation, then to US military custody. In 2002 Habib was transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He continued to be held without charges and suffered coercive interrogation.

The United States accused Habib of having had knowledge of the 11 September 2001 attacks, training the hijackers, staying at an al-Qaeda safe house in Afghanistan, conducting surveillance, helping to transfer chemical weapons, and planning to hijack the aircraft used in the 11 September attacks. He confessed to many acts under torture, but there was no evidence to support these claims.

With legal support, Habib filed for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to challenge his detention. His case of &quot;Habib v. Bush&quot; was one of two consolidated under &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; (2004). The United States Supreme Court ruled in it that US courts had jurisdiction over Guantanamo and that detainees had the right to challenge their detentions in US courts. Following an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; about Habib&#x27;s being taken by extraordinary rendition and held secretly in Egypt, the United States decided to release him without charges in January 2005. After Habib returned to Australia in January 2005, officials eventually acknowledged that he &quot;knew nothing about terrorism&quot;.

Habib filed suit against the Australian government for cooperating with the United States in his detention and coercive interrogations. In November 2008, Habib published a memoir co-written with Julia Collingwood, &quot;My Story: The Tale of a Terrorist Who Wasn&#x27;t,&quot; detailing his experiences. In December 2010, an Egyptian official confirmed Habib&#x27;s account of his torture in Egypt having been witnessed by an Australian officer, whom he named. The Australian government made an out-of-court settlement in the suit by Habib.

==Life==
Mamdouh Habib was born on 3 June 1955 in Alexandria, Egypt, where he grew up in a Muslim family. He moved at the age of 24 to Australia in 1980, to join his older brother and sister, who had settled there and urged him to come. He lived and worked in Sydney and became a citizen.

Through his brother&#x27;s wife, he met her sister, Maha. They married and have had four children, including twin sons.

He worked running a coffee shop and also taught classes and students in Islam. He is a dual citizen of Egypt and Australia. He also worked as a taxi driver.

In the fall of 2001, Habib was arrested in Pakistan. He was held for what was a total of more than three years. After being released in January 2005 without charge by the United States and returned to Australia, Habib encountered difficulties: his passport was revoked and even in 2006, he could not obtain one. The government advised him he would be under surveillance and was still considered a risk.

Habib told his account numerous times to media: he said that he had been interrogated about supposed terrorist activities while under torture in Pakistan, taken to Egypt and interrogated under torture there, transferred to United States military custody in Afghanistan, and transported to Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he suffered extended solitary confinement, more interrogation and torture. He said that Australian officers had been present at some of these occasions. After the Australian government was notified of his detention in Guantanamo, he was interrogated there by an ASIO agent, who he says threatened him and his family. The torture and Australian witness were denied by the respective governments, and Egypt denied he had been held in the country.

He filed suit against the Australian government for cooperating in his detention and treatment. In December 2010, an Egyptian officer confirmed his story of coercive interrogation in Egypt, with an Australian witness, and said the sessions had been videotaped. Soon after that, the Australian government settled with Habib in a confidential settlement out-of-court, as reported by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in February 2011.

Later, in 2007, Habib entered politics. He ran as an independent political candidate in the 2007 New South Wales state election. Receiving less than 5% in his electorate in a secure Labor district, he did not gain a seat.

==1990s==
When Habib&#x27;s case was being heard by the US Supreme Court, in 2004 the ABC current affairs program, &quot;Four Corners,&quot; featured him as the subject of a program. It said that in the 1990s, the Australian Defence Housing Authority took out an &quot;apprehended violence&quot; order against him. DHA claimed that Habib had made a threatening phone call following the cancellation of a contract with the organisation. Habib says this was nothing more than an argument over a contract. In court his psychiatrist had testified that Habib was suffering from major depression at the time and was being treated with Prozac, but that he was not prone to violence. A witness described his irritability and sadness but said he was not aggressive or violent.

According to &quot;Four Corners&quot;, in early 2001, at a meeting with police, Habib was described by them as showing &quot;signs of hostility towards government organisations and the community generally&quot;. Asked to do &quot;a detailed threat assessment,&quot; the Protective Services Group concluded there was no evidence to support concerns that Habib might commit an act of violence. The police decided Habib was &quot;a repetitious and vexatious complainant&quot; with &quot;little credibility.&quot;

==2001 to 2005 imprisonment: Pakistan, Egypt, Afghanistan, Cuba==
Habib claims he became disaffected with Australia, and traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2001 to find an Islamic school to educate his children. He was arrested in Pakistan in October 2001 while traveling by bus to Karachi, Pakistan. The bus was stopped by local police who arrested Habib and two Germans. The two German citizens were released shortly thereafter. The &quot;Four Corners&quot; program stated that the two Germans were asked whether they had seen Habib, and whether he had told them that he had been in Afghanistan. They said nothing that incriminated Habib; one replied; &quot;No. I didn&#x27;t see him in the camps I was in. Nor did he tell us that he had been in a training camp.&quot;

After questioning by Pakistani and CIA officers, Habib was transported in custody by extraordinary rendition to Egypt, his country of origin. There he was held for 5 months and questioned before being transferred to US military custody and imprisoned in Afghanistan. A Pentagon spokesman said at the time that Habib was a terrorist who had spent his time across the border in Afghanistan, &quot;either supporting hostile forces, or on the battlefield fighting illegally against the U.S.&quot; following its entry in the fall of 2001.

Australian government authorities alleged that while Habib had been in Afghanistan, he took an advanced al-Qaeda training course in a camp near Kabul. It claimed that the course included surveillance and photographing facilities, the establishment and use of safe houses, covert travel and writing secret reports. Australian authorities say that several other men who took part in the course identified Habib as having been there. Evidence to support these claims was not made public.

The CIA sent Habib back to Egypt by extraordinary rendition, where he claims he was held and interrogated under torture for five months. He claims his Egyptian captors allegedly shocked him with high-voltage wires, hung him from metal hooks on walls, and beat him. In 2005 an Egyptian official said that he could not comment on these specific allegations, but added that accusations that the Egyptian government was torturing people &quot;tend to be mythology&quot;. The claims have been substantiated by other witnesses and Moazzam Begg, a British citizen and former detainee at Guantanamo who founded Cageprisoners, an organization representing detainees.

&quot;They outsource torture,&quot; said Stephen Hopper, Habib&#x27;s Australian lawyer, referring to the practices of the United States. &quot;You get your friends and allies to do your dirty work for you.&quot; Habib has said that some of his interrogators in Pakistan had recognizable American accents, and that one had a tattoo of an American flag on his arm.

In 2002, the US transported Habib from Egypt to Guantanamo Bay, where he was detained for two years. During detention, Habib confessed to a litany of terrorism-related crimes, including teaching martial arts to several of the September 11 hijackers and planning a hijacking. After release, in 2005 Habib insisted that his confessions were false and given under &quot;duress and torture.&quot;

==&quot;Mamdouh Ibrahim Ahmed Habib v. George Bush&quot;==
A writ of habeas corpus, &quot;Mamdouh Ibrahim Ahmed Habib v. George Bush&quot;, was submitted on Mamdouh Ibrahim Ahmed Habib&#x27;s behalf. In response, on 1 October 2004, the Department of Defense released 63 pages of unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. On 20 September 2004, his &quot;enemy combatant&quot; status was confirmed by Tribunal panel 6.

==2005 on: release and post-release==
On 11 January 2005, the day before his charges were scheduled to be laid by the military commission, Dana Priest at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a front-page article of Habib&#x27;s account of his experiences, including his extraordinary rendition to Egypt and torture there and at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Later that day, the United States government announced that it would not be charging Habib, and would release him to Australia. The Australian Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock announced that Habib would be repatriated within days.

The Australian government chartered a special plane (for approximately $500,000) to fly Habib home because the US would not allow him to travel on a regular commercial flight. US officials insisted he be shackled during the flight. Habib returned to Australia on 28 January 2005.

==Return to Australia==
After his return, in January 2005, Habib filed suit against the Australian government for its cooperation with the United States, alleging that he was beaten and humiliated in Pakistan after his arrest. He also alleged that an Australian official was present at some of these interrogations, but the Australian Government denied this. Habib claims to have been suspended to a ceiling by his arms, standing atop a barrel drum, and that when he gave an answer his Pakistani interrogators didn&#x27;t believe, they would jolt him with electricity until he fainted.
Habib also alleged that at Guantanamo, he suffered both mental and physical abuse: for instance, interrogators told him that his family had been killed, and he was tied to the ground while a prostitute threw menstrual blood on him.
(Note: It is now known that in August 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel, United States Department of Justice, issued three documents of legal opinion to the CIA, which have come to be called the Torture Memos, narrowly defining torture and authorizing certain enhanced interrogation techniques, and another in March 2003 to DOD. Such techniques, commonly classified as torture, were adopted by the CIA and DOD.)

At the time, the Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, publicly challenged Habib&#x27;s claims, saying &quot;no evidence has been found to prove that torture has been used at the camp.&quot; Since that time, there have been numerous allegations and documentation of torture by former detainees at Guantanamo. In addition, in the spring of 2004, the Abu Ghraib prisoner torture and abuse scandal in Iraq had captured media attention, showing that excesses had been committed against prisoners under US military supervision. In spring 2004, one of the &quot;Torture Memos&quot; was leaked to the press, which gave insight into the legal opinions being promulgated in the George W. Bush administration.

In February 2005, the &quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; interviewed Christopher Tennant, the director of Sydney University&#x27;s Psychological medicine unit.
Having examined Habib after his return, Tennant said:
*&quot;He [Habib] showed me marks on his back, he showed me cigarette burns on his body, and the subsequent examination by another professor of medicine, more expert in physical examination than me, confirmed that he&#x27;s got skin discolouration on his right loin which would be consistent with old bruising, which in turn would be consistent with beating...&quot;
*&quot;Well, the main feature of the medical report from Guantanamo was that he had had repeatedly blood in his urine, which is a very significant symptom and a worrying symptom, and that was consistent with his reports both to me and to the specialist physician who also examined him, and was consistent with the fact that, on examination, he had evidence of discolouration to his skin on his right loin, just over his kidney, which in turn was consistent with old bruising and possibly due to being beaten.&quot;

Australian officials revoked Habib&#x27;s passport, saying he remained under suspicion. They warned him that his activities would be constantly monitored to ensure he does not become a security threat. He was not charged and remained relatively free. His records from Guantanamo Bay, released in a WikiLeaks dump in April 2011, indicated that US officials considered him a relatively high risk.

The Australian government said it wanted to prevent Habib from being paid by the media for interviews or &quot;making profits from committing a crime,&quot; but he had not been charged or convicted of a crime in any country. (Current anti-terrorism laws in Australia make it illegal to be involved in terrorist organisations, but Habib was already in custody when these laws were introduced and he cannot be convicted under them. There is no evidence that he was involved in such organisations.) John Howard, then Australian Prime Minister, ruled out any apology to Habib.

Habib told his family everything that had happened after he left Sydney in July 2001. Just in case something bad happens to him, he said, &quot;I want them to know fully everything&quot;.

Habib has struggled to get back to his normal life. On 22 August 2005 he complained of having been attacked by three men with a knife while walking with his wife near his home in Guildford. He told police that he was followed by a car that cut its headlights as he and his wife, Maha, went for a walk just after midnight, and that as the men ran away, the person holding the knife had yelled &quot;something like &#x27;this should keep you quiet&quot;&#x27;.

On 29 March 2006, Habib and his son Moustafa said that they witnessed the aftermath of a double murder in the Sydney suburb of Granville. When they reported the murder to police, Habib alleges they were abused, assaulted and interrogated by police officers. On 3 April, he announced his intention to sue New South Wales Police for false imprisonment and assault.

On 11 June 2007, the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#x27;s (ABC) investigative journalism program, &quot;Four Corners,&quot; aired a documentary on extraordinary renditions and the ghost prisoners who were being held by US civilian intelligence agencies abroad. Because of Habib&#x27;s arrest in Pakistan and rendition to Egypt, the program featured his case.

On 7 March 2008, Habib lost his defamation case against Nationwide News, publisher of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Justice Peter McClellan found Habib was &quot;prone to exaggerate&quot;, &quot;evasive&quot; and had made claims about mistreatment in Pakistan and Egypt which could not be sustained. He found that &quot;Habib&#x27;s claims that he was seriously mistreated in the place of detention in Islamabad cannot be accepted&quot; and &quot;that this evidence was given in order to enhance his forensic position in the present litigation.&quot; In November 2008, Habib published his memoir, &quot;My Story: The Tale of a Terrorist Who Wasn&#x27;t&quot;, written with Julia Collingwood. In it he recounted events of torture at the places he was detained.

On 1 May 2009, Habib lost an appeal in the Full Federal Court against a 2007 Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) decision that affirmed the former Foreign Affairs minister&#x27;s decision in 2006 to refuse him an Australian passport. The government had revoked his passport when he was first returned to Australia and refused to issue him one in 2006. The AAT had concluded that Habib and his wife had given false evidence in the proceedings. They said that Habib still held the extremist sentiments that the government had understood he had held before 2001.

In February 2010, Habib was scheduled to appear in his ten-minute play, &quot;Waiting For Mamdouh&quot;, a monologue about his time in detention, at the &quot;Short+Sweet&quot; theatrical festival in Sydney.

In December 2010, Habib reached an out-of-court, confidential settlement with the Australian government. He received a secret sum in exchange for absolving the government of liability in his treatment during his detention by the United States. At the time, Habib has said that he plans to use the money to begin an international lawsuit against the Egyptian and United States governments over his treatment. He said that he had fresh evidence, including film footage.

On 13 February 2011, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published an article confirming Habib&#x27;s accounts of torture in Egypt with at least one Australian officer as a witness, as an Egyptian officer had affirmed his account and named the officer. The Australian government initiated an investigation. The newspaper said the officer&#x27;s account was the reason that the government had settled with Habib in December 2010. The officer said there were videotapes of the interrogations of Habib.

In April 2011, Habib&#x27;s case file was among many documents from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in the WikiLeaks. His records from Guantanamo Bay included American comments that he was &quot;deceptive.&quot; In May 2011, Habib was granted an Australian passport. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said that it no longer considered him a security risk.

==Entrance into Australian politics==
In the March 2007 New South Wales state election, Habib stood as an independent candidate in the safe Labor seat of Auburn in Sydney. He received less than 5% of the vote 
and the seat was comfortably retained by the Australian Labor Party.

He campaigned for the removal of the Federal Government&#x27;s anti-terror laws, stating &quot;The terror laws are if you have terrorists, but we don&#x27;t have terrorists&quot;.

<doc id="1225063" wikidata="Q638045" url="?curid=1225063" title="Cab signalling">
<text>Cab signaling is a railway safety system that communicates track status and condition information to the cab, crew compartment or driver&#x27;s compartment of a locomotive, railcar or multiple unit. The information is continually updated giving an easy to read display to the train driver or engine driver.

The simplest systems display the trackside signal, while more sophisticated systems also display allowable speed, location of nearby trains, and dynamic information about the track ahead. Cab signals can also be part of a more comprehensive train protection system that can automatically apply the brakes stopping the train if the operator does not respond appropriately to a dangerous condition.

The main purpose of a signal system is to enforce a safe separation between trains and to stop or slow trains in advance of a restrictive situation. The cab signal system is an improvement over the wayside signal system, where visual signals beside or above the right-of-way govern the movement of trains, as it provides the train operator with a continuous reminder of the last wayside signal or a continuous indication of the state of the track ahead.

== History ==
The first such systems were installed on an experimental basis in the 1910s in the United Kingdom, in the 1920s in the United States, and in the Netherlands in the 1940s. Modern high-speed rail systems such as those in Japan, France, and Germany were all designed from the start to use in-cab signalling due to the impracticality of sighting wayside signals at the new higher train speeds. Worldwide, legacy rail lines continue to see limited adoption of Cab Signaling outside of high density or suburban rail districts and in many cases is precluded by use of older intermittent Automatic Train Stop technology.

In North America, the coded track circuit system developed by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and Union Switch &amp; Signal (US&amp;S) became the de facto national standard. Variations of this system are also in use on many rapid transit systems and form the basis for several international cab signalling systems such as CAWS in Ireland, BACC in Italy, ALSN in Russia and the first generation Shinkansen signalling developed by Japan National Railways (JNR).

In Europe and elsewhere in the world, cab signalling standards were developed on a country by country basis with limited interoperability, however new technologies like the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) aim to improve interoperability. The train-control component of ERTMS, termed European Train Control System (ETCS), is a functional specification that incorporates some of the former national standards and allows them to be fully interoperable with a few modifications.

== Cab signal types ==
All cab signalling systems must have a continuous in-cab indication to inform the driver of track condition ahead; however, these fall into two main categories. Intermittent cab signals are updated at discrete points along the rail line and between these points the display will reflect information from the last update. Continuous cab signals receive a continuous flow of information about the state of the track ahead and can have the cab indication change at any time to reflect any updates. The majority of cab signalling systems, including those that use coded track circuits, are continuous.

=== Intermittent ===
The German Indusi and Dutch ATB-NG fall into this category. These and other such systems provide constant reminders to drivers of track conditions ahead, but are only updated at discrete points. This can lead to situations where the information displayed to the driver has become out of date. Intermittent cab signalling systems have functional overlap with many other train protection systems such as trip stops, but the distinction is that a driver or automatic operating system makes continuous reference to the last received update.

=== Continuous ===
Continuous systems have the added benefit of fail safe behaviour in the event a train stops receiving the continuous event relied upon by the cab signalling system. Early systems use the rails or loop conductors laid along the track to provide continuous communication between wayside signal systems and the train. These systems provided for the transmission of more information than was typically possible with contemporary intermittent systems and are what enabled the ability to display a miniature signal to the driver; hence the term, &quot;cab signalling&quot;. Continuous systems are also more easily paired with Automatic Train Control technology, which can enforce speed restrictions based on information received through the signalling system, because continuous cab signals can change at any time to be more or less restrictive, providing for more efficient operation than intermittent ATC systems.

== Information transmission ==
Cab signals require a means of transmitting information from wayside to train. There are a few main methods to accomplish this information transfer.

=== Electric or magnetic ===
This is popular for early intermittent systems that used the presence of a magnetic field or electric current to designate a hazardous condition. The British Rail Automatic Warning System (AWS) is an example of a two-indication cab signal system transmitting information using a magnetic field.

=== Inductive ===
Inductive systems are non-contact systems that rely on more than the simple presence or absence of a magnetic field to transmit a message. Inductive systems typically require a beacon or an induction loop to be installed at every signal and other intermediate locations. The inductive coil uses a changing magnetic field to transmit messages to the train. Typically, the frequency of pulses in the inductive coil are assigned different meanings. Continuous inductive systems can be made by using the running rails as one long tuned inductive loop.

Examples of intermittent inductive systems include the German Indusi system. Continuous inductive systems include the two-aspect General Railway Signal Company &quot;Automatic Train Control&quot; installed on the Chicago and North Western Railroad among others.

=== Coded track circuits ===
A coded track circuit based system is essentially an inductive system that uses the running rails as information transmitter. The coded track circuits serve a dual purpose: to perform the train detection and rail continuity detection functions of a standard track circuit, and to continuously transmit signal indications to the train. The coded track circuit systems eliminate the need for specialized beacons.

Examples of coded track circuit systems include the Pennsylvania Railroad standard system, a variation of which was used on the London Underground Victoria line, Later, audio frequency (AF) track circuit systems eventually came to replace &quot;power&quot; frequency systems in rapid transit applications as higher frequency signals could self-attenuate reducing the need for insulated rail joints. Some of the first users of AF cab signal systems include the Washington Metro and Bay Area Rapid Transit. More recently, digital systems have become preferred, transmitting speed information to trains using datagrams instead of simple codes. The French TVM makes use of the running rails to transmit the digital signalling information, while the German LZB system makes use of auxiliary wires strung down the centre of the track to continually transmit the signalling information.

=== Transponder ===
Transponder based systems make use of fixed antenna loops or beacons (called balises) that transmit datagrams or other information to a train as it passes overhead. While similar to intermittent inductive systems, transponder based cab signalling transmit more information and can also receive information from the train to aid traffic management. The low cost of loops and beacons allows for a larger number of information points that may have been possible with older systems as well as finer grained signalling information. The British Automatic Train Protection was one example of this technology along with the more recent Dutch ATB-NG.

=== Wireless ===
Wireless cab signalling systems dispense with all track-based communications infrastructure and instead rely on fixed wireless transmitters to send trains signalling information. This method is most closely associated with communications-based train control. ETCS levels 2 and 3 make use of this system, as do a number of other cab signalling systems under development.

== Cab display unit ==
The cab display unit (CDU), (also called a driver machine interface (DMI) in the ERTMS standard) is the interface between the train operator and the cab signalling system. Early CDU&#x27;s displayed simple warning indications or representations of wayside railway signals. Later, many railways and rapid transit systems would dispense with miniature in-cab signals in favour of an indication of what speed the operator was permitted to travel at. Typically this was in conjunction with some sort of Automatic Train Control speed enforcement system where it becomes more important for operators to run their trains at specific speeds instead of using their judgement based on signal indications. One common innovation was to integrate the speedometer and cab signal display, superimposing or juxtaposing the allowed speed with the current speed. Digital cab signalling systems that make use of datagrams with &quot;distance to target&quot; information can use simple displays that simply inform the driver when they are approaching a speed penalty or have triggered a speed penalty or more complex ones that show a moving graph of the minimum braking curves permitted to reach the speed target. 

CDU&#x27;s also inform the operator which, if any, mode the system might be in or if it is active at all. CDU&#x27;s can also be integrated into the alertness system, providing count-downs to the alertness penalty or a means by which to cancel the alarm.

== Cab signalling systems in the United States ==
Cab signalling in the United States was driven by a 1922 ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that required 49 railways to install some form of automatic train control in one full passenger division by 1925. While several large railways, including the Santa Fe and New York Central, fulfilled the requirement by installing intermittent inductive train stop devices, the PRR saw an opportunity to improve operational efficiency and installed the first continuous cab signal systems, eventually settling on pulse code cab signaling technology supplied by Union Switch and Signal.

In response to the PRR lead, the ICC mandated that some of the nation&#x27;s other large railways must equip at least one division with continuous cab signal technology as a test to compare technologies and operating practices. The affected railroads were less than enthusiastic, and many chose to equip one of their more isolated or less trafficked routes to minimize the number of locomotives to be equipped with the apparatus.

Several railways chose the inductive loop system rejected by the PRR. These railways included the Central Railroad of New Jersey (installed on its Southern Division), the Reading Railroad (installed on its Atlantic City Railroad main line), the New York Central, and the Florida East Coast. Both the Chicago and North Western and Illinois Central employed a two-aspect system on select suburban lines near Chicago. The cab signals would display &quot;Clear&quot; or &quot;Restricting&quot; aspects. The CNW went further and eliminated the wayside intermediate signals in the stretch of track between Elmhurst and West Chicago, requiring trains to proceed solely based on the 2-aspect cab signals. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad had a 3-aspect system operating by 1935 between Portage, Wisconsin and Minneapolis, Minnesota.

As the Pennsylvania Railroad system was the only one adopted on a large scale, it became a de facto national standard, and most installations of cab signals in the current era have been this type. Recently, there have been several new types of cab signalling which use communications-based technology to reduce the cost of wayside equipment or supplement existing signal technologies to enforce speed restrictions and absolute stops and to respond to grade crossing malfunctions or incursions.

The first of these was the Speed Enforcement System (SES) employed by New Jersey Transit on their low-density Pascack Valley Line as a pilot program using a dedicated fleet of 13 GP40PH-2 locomotives. SES used a system of transponder beacons attached to wayside block signals to enforce signal speed. SES was disliked by engine crews due to its habit of causing immediate penalty brake applications without first sounding an overspeed alarm and giving the engineer a chance to decelerate. SES is in the process of being removed from this line, and is being replaced with CSS.

Amtrak uses the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) for its &quot;Acela Express&quot; high-speed rail service on the NEC. ACSES was an overlay to the existing PRR-type CSS and uses the same SES transponder technology to enforce both permanent and temporary speed restrictions at curves and other geographic features. The on-board cab signal unit processes both the pulse code &quot;signal speed&quot; and the ACSES &quot;civil speed&quot;, then enforces the lower of the two. ACSES also provides for a positive stop at absolute signals which could be released by a code provided by the dispatcher transmitted from the stopped locomotive via a data radio. Later this was amended to a simpler &quot;stop release&quot; button on the cab signal display.

<text>Yanzhao Evening News or &quot;Yanzhao Wanbao&quot; (), also known as &quot;Yanzhao Evening Post&quot;, is a tabloid newspaper published in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province, China. Its predecessor was &quot;Shijiazhuang Evening Post&quot; (石家庄晚报), which was launched on January 1, 1988, and ceased publication at the end of 1989.

&quot;Yanzhao Evening Post&quot;, sponsored by the Shijiazhuang Daily Agency (石家庄日报社), is the earliest evening newspaper in Hebei. Focused on the daily life of Shijiazhuang citizens, the newspaper is very popular for its sports and entertainment report. It is mainly circulated in city areas and 17 counties belonging to Shijiazhuang. These days, the paper can be bought in 11 cities of Hebei, but the quantity is still small.

The main competitor of &quot;Yanzhao Evening Post&quot; is &quot;Yanzhao Metropolis Daily&quot;, a tabloid published all 11 cities of Hebei.

<doc id="1225077" wikidata="Q15647" url="?curid=1225077" title="Oxygen (Wild Orchid album)">
<text>Oxygen is the second album by American group Wild Orchid, released in 1998. Since its release, the album has sold over 200,000 copies worldwide.

==Production==
Thirty songs were written for &quot;Oxygen&quot; in a couple of months time and the ten best songs were chosen to be recorded. Wild Orchid also recorded cover versions of &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot;. The reason for the album&#x27;s title was explained by Ridel in an interview with Hit Records stating that, &quot;On this album we wanted to you know take a deep breath and leave more space, let things have room to breathe. Our sound&#x27;s a little lighter and that was the concept of &quot;Oxygen&quot;.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
The album was released in September 1998 and coincided with their stint as &quot;Guess&quot; spokespersons and models and as hosts of the new Fox Family reality show &quot;Great Pretenders&quot;, in which kids and teens of all ages lip sync their favorite songs while competing for prizes. They went on a promotional tour throughout the U.S. and were guests on &quot;Donny and Marie&quot;, where they performed &quot;Be Mine&quot; (the album&#x27;s lead single). From June 16 to August 28, 1999 the group opened for Cher during her &quot;Do You Believe? Tour&quot; alongside Cyndi Lauper for 52 dates. The group even made a guest appearance on the &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; episode &quot;Beheading St. Valentine&quot; where they performed &quot;Declaration&quot; and &quot;Come As You Are&quot; at the fictitious Peach Pit After Dark.

==Rumored new version==
Since &quot;Oxygen&quot; was a commercial failure, rumors were spread in 1999 about the group returning to the studio to record a new version of the album. When a remixed version of &quot;Come As You Are&quot; was leaked onto the internet, fans made assumptions that this version would appear on the new version of &quot;Oxygen&quot;, but it was never officially released and neither was a new version of &quot;Oxygen&quot;.

<text>Dovid Leibowitz (May 15, 1887 – December 4, 1941) was a Russian-born American rabbi. A disciple of Slabodka yeshiva in Lithuania, he went on to found Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim in the United States, where he served as rosh yeshiva (dean). 

==Early life==
As a teenager Leibowitz studied in the Radin Yeshiva, where he held private study sessions with his great-uncle and founder of the yeshiva—Yisrael Meir Kagan—helping him to write the last volume of his &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot;. He also studied there under Naftoli Trop. In 1908 Leibowitz transferred to the Slabodka yeshiva, where he studied under Nosson Tzvi Finkel. In 1915 Leibowitz succeeded his father-in-law as rabbi of Šalčininkai. After six years he returned to Slabodka as a founding member of the Slabodka &quot;kollel&quot;.

==Career==
In January 1927, Leibowitz went to the United States as a fund-raiser for the &quot;kollel&quot;, and was invited to become the first rosh yeshiva (dean) of Mesivta Torah Vodaath. Among his students were Gedalia Schorr and Avraham Yaakov Pam. In 1933, Leibowitz founded the Rabbinical Seminary of America (RSA) in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. He did so after a dispute arose with Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz—head of Torah Vodaath—over the goals of Torah Vodaath, and consequent legal proceedings before a rabbinical court. Leibowitz served as RSA&#x27;s first rosh yeshiva. The school, which later moved to Kew Gardens Hills, Queens is better known today as Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim, so named for Leibowitz&#x27;s great-uncle, who was known as the &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;.

==Death==
Leibowitz died of a heart attack on Thursday December 4, 1941. His funeral was held on Sunday December 7, 1941. The yeshiva was headed for the following sixty-seven years by his only son, Henoch Leibowitz.

<doc id="1225081" wikidata="Q943578" url="?curid=1225081" title="Sir Patrick Spens">
<text>&quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; is one of the most popular of the Child Ballads (No. 58) (Roud 41), and is of Scottish origin. It is a maritime ballad about a disaster at sea.

==Background==
&quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; remains one of the most anthologized of British popular ballads, partly because it exemplifies the traditional ballad form. The strength of this ballad, its emotional force, lies in its unadorned narrative which progresses rapidly to a tragic end that has been foreshadowed almost from the beginning. It was first published in eleven stanzas in 1765 in Bishop Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;, based on &quot;two MS. copies transmitted from Scotland&quot;.

The protagonist is referred to as &quot;young Patrick Spens&quot; in some versions of the ballad.

==Plot==
The story as told in the ballad has multiple versions, but they all follow the same basic plot. The King of Scotland has called for the greatest sailor in the land to command a ship for a royal errand. The name &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; is mentioned by a courtier, and the king despatches a letter. Sir Patrick is dismayed at being commanded to put to sea in the dead of winter, clearly realising this voyage could well be his last.

Versions differ somewhat at this point. Some indicate that a storm sank the ship in the initial crossing, thus ending the ballad at this point, while many have Sir Patrick safely reaching Norway. In Norway tension arises between the Norwegian lords and the Scots, who are accused of being a financial burden on the king. Sir Patrick, taking offence, leaves the following day. Nearly all versions, whether they have the wreck on the outward voyage or the return, relate the bad omen of seeing &quot;the new mune late yestreen, with the auld mune in her airms&quot;, and modern science agrees the tides would be at maximum force at that time. The winter storms have the best of the great sailor, sending him and the Scottish lords to the bottom of the sea.

==Version==
Francis James Child collected some eighteen versions of &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot;. There is no one definitive version of more validity than any other, because the song continues in oral tradition and it may be interpreted in both the singing and the transcription. This is one version:

==Analysis==
The story itself is simple and yet universal in its theme: the courageous knight dutifully obeys the command of his king despite the knowledge that he will almost certainly be going to his death. In the two-stanza exchange between Spens and the old
sailor, Mark Strand and Eavan Boland have noted &quot;the immediacy, music, and fatalism of the ballad...&quot;

William Bowman Piper identifies a pattern of contrasts between authority, represented by the anonymous king, and nobility, as displayed by Patrick Spens. The references to the women awaiting the arrival of their men describe an experience common to any dangerous enterprise in peacetime or in war, and as old as the Bible.

==Historicity==

William H. Matchett considers the ballad probably to be fiction.

The events of the ballad are similar to, and may chronicle, an actual event: 
*In 1290, the Scottish heir to the throne, the seven-year-old Margaret, Maid of Norway, was being conveyed across the North Sea to Scotland when she took sick and died. Her mother, Margaret was married to Eric II of Norway in the summer of 1281. She was conducted to the wedding in Bergen by a number of knights and nobles, who were drowned on the return voyage.
*The name &quot;Patrick Spens&quot; has no historical record, and, like many of the heroes of such ballads, is probably an invention, although some historians believe that he was actually Sir Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch. Vans was the original ambassador sent to negotiate the marriage between James VI and Anne of Denmark, and accompanied James VI when he set out during tempestuous weather in October 1589 to bring home his bride, who had been driven back to the coast of Norway by storms. It was Thomas Finlayson Henderson’s theory that the ballad was most likely based on this voyage.

The opening lines refer to a king who is located in Dunfermline where historically there was a royal residence, Malcolm&#x27;s Tower.

Earl&#x27;s Knowle on Papa Stronsay is traditionally held to be the final resting place of Sir Patrick Spens. The history relating to the burial of Sir Patrick Spens on Earl’s Knowle on Papa Stronsay is related by William Edmonstoune Aytoun (b. Edinburgh 21 June 1813, d. 4 August 1865), Sheriff and Lord Admiral of Orkney and Shetland. It was after his retirement from this position that he edited a collection of Scottish poetry in which the first poem is Sir Patrick Spens. In his foreword to the poem Aytoun, he writes:
:“It is true that the name of Sir Patrick Spens is not mentioned in history; but I am able to state that tradition has preserved it. In the little island of Papa Stronsay, one of the Orcadian group, lying over against Norway, there is a large grave or tumulus, which has been known to the inhabitants, from time immemorial, as ‘The grave of Sir Patrick Spens’. The Scottish ballads were not early current in Orkney, a Scandinavian country; so it is very unlikely that the poem could have originated the name. The people know nothing beyond the traditional appellation of the spot, and they have no legend to tell. Spens is a Scottish, not a Scandinavian name. Is it, then, a forced conjecture, that the shipwreck took place off the iron bound coast of the northern islands, which did not then belong to the Crown of Scotland? ‘Half ower to Aberdour’ signifies nothing more than that the vessel went down half-way between Norway and the port of embarkation.”

==Influence==
*The ballad fragment &quot;Hardyknute&quot; (1719), attributed to Elizabeth Halket, Lady Wardlaw, appears to draw phrases from a version of &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot;.
*Samuel Taylor Coleridge opens &quot;&quot; quoting the old sailor&#x27;s apprehension of the weather having seen &quot;... the new Moon, With the old Moon in her arms&quot;.
*In &quot;The Old Seaport&quot; David Macbeth Moir cites Spens as an heroic seaman, mirrored in the men of Culross.
*In the 1903 &quot;&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson quotes the verse &quot;O lang, lang may the ladies sit, Wi&#x27; their fans into their hand...&quot; comparing them to the sailors&#x27; wives of Leith and the fisherwomen of Cockenzie &quot;...crowding to the tail of the harbor with a shawl about their ears...&quot; looking for the return of the boats. 
* Herbert Howells: &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot;, Op. 23 (1917)
* Louis MacNeice’s poem ‘’The North Sea’’ (1948) recounts a voyage to Norway and includes many references to Sir Patrick Spens.
* In &quot;Euphoria&quot; by author Lily King the lead characters Nell and Bankston, fictionalized versions of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson recite part of the poem, alternating the opening lines, during a tense night encamped with a primitive tribe in New Guinea.

==Recordings==
Artists who have recorded musical versions of the ballad include:

*Peter Bellamy on his 1982 album &quot;The Maritime England Suite&quot;;

*Anaïs Mitchell and Jefferson Hamer on the album &quot;Child Ballads&quot;; and
*John Langstaff on his 1964 album &quot;Nottamun Town&quot;.
* Being a well-documented song publicised by Mudcat, and Mainly Norfolk, the song was recorded by Jon Boden and Oli Steadman for inclusion in their respective lists of daily folk songs &quot;A Folk Song A Day&quot; and &quot;365 Days Of Folk&quot;.

<text>Michael Anthony Arbib (born May 28, 1940) is an American computational neuroscientist. He is an adjunct professor of Psychology at the University of California at San Diego and professor emeritus at the University of Southern California; before his 2016 retirement he was the Fletcher Jones Professor of computer science, as well as a professor of biological sciences, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, neuroscience and psychology.

==Early life and education==
Arbib was born in England on May 28, 1940, the oldest of four children. His parents moved to New Zealand when he was about 7, and on to Australia when he was about 9. 
Arbib was educated in New Zealand and at The Scots College in Sydney, Australia. In 1960 he took a BSc (Hons) at the University of Sydney, with the University Medal in Pure Mathematics.

Arbib received his PhD in Mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963. He was advised by Norbert Wiener, the founder of cybernetics, and Henry McKean. As a student, he also worked with Warren McCulloch, the co-inventor of the artificial neural network and finite-state machine.

==Career==
Following his PhD, Arbib moved to Stanford for a postdoc with Rudolf E. Kálmán. Arbib spent five years at Stanford, before moving to become becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1970.

<text>Thomas Frank Haller (June 23, 1937 – November 26, 2004) was an American professional baseball player, coach, and executive. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1961 to 1972, most notably as a member of the San Francisco Giants where he made two of his three All-Star teams. Haller ended his playing career with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Detroit Tigers.

Haller was considered one of the top catchers in the National League (NL) during the late 1960s. In 2008, he was part of the inaugural class of inductees into the San Francisco Giants Wall of Fame.

==Major League career==
Haller was born in Lockport, Illinois and attended the University of Illinois, where he played as a quarterback for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team. During his time at the university, Haller was also a member of Theta Chi fraternity. Haller was signed by the San Francisco Giants, as an amateur free agent, in 1958. After playing in the minor leagues for three seasons, he made his major league debut with the Giants on April 11, 1961, at the age of 24.

Haller hit .261, with 18 home runs, and 55 Run batted in (RBI), for the Giants in 1962, in a platoon system, alongside Ed Bailey, although both catchers were left-handed hitters. Haller and Bailey combined to give the Giants 35 home runs and 100 runs batted in from the catcher&#x27;s position as they battled the Los Angeles Dodgers in a tight pennant race. The two teams ended the season tied for first place and met in the 1962 National League tie-breaker series. The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship. The Giants then lost to the New York Yankees in the 1962 World Series in seven games. Haller collected four hits in 14 at-bats, with a home run, and three RBI, during the Series.

Haller continued to platoon with Bailey through the 1963 season, finishing the year second to Johnny Edwards among National League catchers in fielding percentage. In December 1963, the Giants traded Bailey to the Milwaukee Braves for veteran catcher Del Crandall, and Haller became their undisputed starting catcher. He was a solid defensive catcher for the Giants from 1964 to 1967. In his book, &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, baseball historian Bill James said the decision to give Joe Torre a National League Gold Glove Award was absurd, stating that Torre was given the award because of his offensive statistics and that either Haller or John Roseboro was more deserving of the award. Haller also helped offensively in 1965, hitting two home runs and driving in five runs during a game on September 27 to put the Giants in first place with one week left in the season. However, the Giants faltered and ended the season two games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The following season, Haller earned his first All-Star berth when he was named as a reserve player for the National League team in the 1966 All-Star Game. He was the catcher for two twenty-game winners in 1966, as Juan Marichal won 25 games and Gaylord Perry won 21 games. Haller finished the season with career-highs of 27 home runs and 67 runs batted in, as the Giants once again finished second to the Dodgers, by a game and a half. He earned his second consecutive All-Star berth in 1967 when he was named as a reserve for the National League team in the 1967 All-Star Game. Haller ended the 1967 season second to Tim McCarver among NL catchers in assists and in fielding percentage, and guided the Giants&#x27; pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average (ERA) in the National League, as Giants pitcher, Mike McCormick, won the National League Cy Young Award, with a 22-10 record. The Giants finished in second place for a third consecutive season, this time to the St. Louis Cardinals.

In February 1968, the Giants were in need of good infielders, and with four young catching prospects, including Dick Dietz and Dave Rader, club president Chub Feeney decided to trade Haller along with a player to be named later, to the Dodgers, for infielders Ron Hunt and Nate Oliver. The trade was the first between the two teams since their move to the West Coast in , and also the first since the one that would have sent Jackie Robinson from the Dodgers to the Giants after the season. Haller played well in 1968, posting a .285 batting average, in 144 games, and earned his third consecutive All-Star berth. He also played well defensively with career-highs in assists (83) and in double plays (23). He guided the Dodgers&#x27; pitching staff to the second best team earned run average in the league, although the team finished the season in seventh place.

After spending four seasons with the Dodgers, Haller was traded to the Detroit Tigers, in December 1971. He batted .207 with two home runs and 12 runs batted in during the 1972 season as a backup catcher for Bill Freehan, when the Tigers won the American League Eastern Division championship. Haller was the younger brother of American League (AL) umpire Bill Haller and in July 1972, the two men appeared in the same game with Tom catching for the Tigers while Bill stood behind him as the home plate umpire. His playing time was reduced when the Tigers acquired catcher Duke Sims in August. In the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, Haller made only one appearance as a pinch hitter in Game 2, as the Tigers lost the series in five games. In October 1972, the Tigers sold Haller to the Philadelphia Phillies along with pitcher Don Leshnock. Haller then made the decision to retire at the age of 35.

==Career statistics==
In a twelve-year major league career, Haller played in 1,294 games, accumulating 1,011 hits, in 3,935 at bats, for a .257 career batting average, along with 134 home runs, 504 runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .340. A three-time All-Star, he was a more-than-capable defensive catcher, ending his career with a respectable .992 fielding percentage which, at the time of his retirement, was second only to the .993 career record of Elston Howard. Haller led National League catchers in putouts in , and in baserunners caught stealing in . He set the NL single-season record for double plays by a catcher with 23 in 1968. Haller led the NL in sacrifice flies, in 1968, with 9. Haller caught for six pitchers who would eventually be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He caught 107 shutouts during his career, ranking him 23rd all-time among major league catchers. Baseball historian Bill James ranked Haller 26th all-time among major league catchers.

==Coaching and executive career==
After his playing career ended, Haller worked for the Giants as a coach (–), and was their vice president of baseball operations (–). He was named to the Giants&#x27; 25th anniversary team, in 1982. Early in the baseball season, Haller served as the manager of the minor league Double-A Birmingham Barons, of the Southern League (an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox). On June 9, 1986, Haller was named as the General Manager of the White Sox, but disagreements with executive Ken Harrelson led to Haller resigning at the end of the season.

After a long illness, Haller died, in Los Angeles, on November 26, 2004, at the age of 67.

<text>Tales of Eternia, known as Tales of Destiny II in its original North America release, is an action role-playing game published by Namco as the third main title in their &quot;Tales&quot; series. Initially released for the PlayStation in November 2000 in Japan, an English version was later released in North America in September 2001. It was developed by members of Telnet Japan&#x27;s &quot;Wolfteam&quot;, who had previously worked on its predecessors &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;. The game&#x27;s producers gave it the characteristic genre name . A port was released for the PlayStation Portable handheld in Japan in March 2005, and the PAL region in February 2006.

The game, set in the fantasy world of Inferia, follows the story of a young hunter named Reid Hershel and his friends, Farah and Keele, as they meet a mysterious girl named Meredy who speaks an unknown language. Their subsequent quest to discover her origins leads them across a dimensional boundary to an entirely different realm known as Celestia, where they become involved in an age-old conflict between the two worlds. &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was mostly well-received during its initial release, and sold approximately 873,000 copies worldwide. It would later inspire a 13-episode anime produced by Xebec loosely based on the game&#x27;s plot.

==Gameplay==

The game plays similar to other &quot;Tales&quot; games, following the precedent set by previous role-playing video games in general as well. An overworld map is used to navigate from one location to another in the game&#x27;s fictional world. Cities and towns, which are populated with NPCs, are valuable sources of information, for either triggering events that move the plot forward, or extra information that fleshes out the game&#x27;s story and setting. Additionally, city merchants will exchange Gald, the in-game currency, for items or equipment that can be vital to completing the game. Progress can be saved at any time - a first for the series, and the player can also learn recipes throughout the game, using them to cook status-enhancing or healing food out of combat.

Battles with enemies are done through the Linear Motion Battle System, a hybrid fighting system that combines fighting game and traditional role-playing game elements. Movements and attacks are done in real-time, with the fighting being compared to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. Much like its predecessors, &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; gives the player a large degree of control over computer-controlled allies and the techniques they use.

Since the player only directly controls one character at a time, all other characters are governed by the general rules of AI behavior set by the player before and during battle. During battle, the player can switch which character he or she is controlling, while issuing specific orders to other allies to execute certain techniques on command. The action can be paused to use different menus for things such as item. The game&#x27;s menu screens can be used to organize and uses items, creates new magic spells, develops battle strategies, changes character equipment, and views character statistics. Selected features from the menu screen, such as item use and AI settings, are available in battle, while other aspects are relegated to outside of battle.

==Plot==

===Synopsis===
The game follows Reid Hershel as he tries to prevent the Grand Fall, a cataclysmic event that would destroy his planet along with that of newly found traveling companion Meredy. Specifically, the Grand Fall entails the violent collision of twin planets Inferia and Celestia. The two planets face one another while being separated by the Orbus Barrier. Interaction between the two planets has been infrequent over the last few centuries despite their proximity; the Bridge of Light linked Inferia and Celestia in the distant past, but the link has been severed for an extensive period of time. The Aurora War, an ancient conflict that set Inferia against Celestia over two thousand years ago, continues to generate persistent mistrust between the two groups. The Orbus Barrier has shown recent signs of weakening and possible collapse due to the actions of an unknown external force.

The journey takes Reid across both planets, as he seeks out those responsible for this movement towards the brink of annihilation.

===Main characters===
* is an 18-year-old hunter from a small village who grew up with Farah and Keele. He is a laid-back character who enjoys a quiet life of eating and sleeping, and possesses a mysterious power known as &quot;Fibril&quot; which grants extraordinary abilities. He is voiced by Akira Ishida in the Japanese version. His name comes from British astronomer William Herschel.
* is a 17-year-old farmhand and martial artist skilled in hand-to-hand combat and quick combination attacks. She is characterized as being headstrong as well as altruistic and caring with a keen sense of justice, and has a budding relationship with Reid throughout the course of the game. She is voiced by Yūko Minaguchi in the Japanese version, and her name comes from Danish physicist Hans Ørsted.
* is a 17-year-old student of magic known as a Craymal Mage. Although he is physically weak and tires easily, he has an insatiable hunger for knowledge and unlocking the mysteries of his world, yet he is sometimes blinded by his over-reliance on science and pure logic. He is voiced by Sōichirō Hoshi in the Japanese version.
* is a 16-year-old Craymal Mage from Celestia who speaks a language alien to the Inferians, &quot;Melnics&quot;, that prevents her from being understood at the beginning of the game. A happy-go-lucky girl, she is known to spontaneously break into dance and is always accompanied by her pet . She is voiced by Omi Minami in the Japanese version.
* is a 12-year-old Celestian and descendant of a famous pirate who styles herself as the oddball captain of his impressive ship, the &quot;Van Eltia&quot;. Though highly intelligent for her age, she lived in isolation and avoided contact with most people until she met Reid and his friends. She fights using her handbag with an assortment of tools. She is voiced by Junko Noda in the Japanese version.
* is a 38-year-old Celestian leader of the resistance group Shikeska, who are in direct opposition against the corrupt Celestian government. Loud, boisterous, and prone to laughter, he wields special high-powered energy cannons that can fire capsules of a variety of elements. He is voiced by Masashi Ebara in the Japanese version.
* is a mysterious 25-year-old swordsman who masquerades as a merchant. Despite his calm outward appearance, he is a highly determined fighter who periodically aids Reid and his friends on their journey. He is voiced by Hiroshi Isobe in the Japanese version, and his name comes from the Fomalhaut star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus.

==Development==
&quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was first announced in a September 1999 press conference by representatives of Namco as the third game in the &quot;Tales&quot; series, and was later shown in non-playable form at the Tokyo Game Show in March 2000. Character design was handled by artist Mutsumi Inomata, who had previously worked on the game&#x27;s predecessor &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;, and features animated cutscenes by anime studio Production I.G. Namco released a limited special edition of the game in Japan alongside its standard release known as the , which included character figurines, an art book, and a clock shaped like the character Quickie. Players who preordered the game in participating Sofmap electronics stores also received an alarm clock featuring official artwork of the main cast.

While eventually released under this name in Japan, when released in the North American region, the game was retitled to &quot;Tales of Destiny II&quot;. Some speculated the game was retitled to avoid trademark infringement on the word &quot;Eternia&quot;, owned by Mattel in North America for the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; toyline, but the game&#x27;s creators stated it was done strictly for brand name and brand recognition reasons; &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot; was the first of the &quot;Tales&quot; game to be released in North America, and they wanted to draw a clear connection between the two games. The first game in the &quot;Tales&quot; series, &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot;, released in 1995 for the Super Famicom, was not brought to North America until it was ported to the Game Boy Advance and released later in 2006, so for some time, &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot; was the beginning of the series for North American audiences. The naming choice would later cause further confusion after the release of the PlayStation 2 game known as &quot;Tales of Destiny 2&quot;, a genuine sequel to &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot; taking place in the same fictional world. &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; is not actually directly related to &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;, and is a different game from &quot;Tales of Destiny 2&quot; for the PlayStation 2 in 2002.

===PSP re-release===
In early 2004, Namco announced a port of &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; for the PlayStation Portable handheld under the project codename &quot;T.O.E.&quot; A playable demo was featured at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June, and later at the 2004 Tokyo Game Show the following September. The game itself was largely unchanged, although Namco did manage to greatly reduce loading times, eliminating the need for any &quot;now loading&quot; signs altogether. Graphically, the game was altered to match the PSP&#x27;s specifications. The field graphics were cropped, and the battles being redone in full widescreen, and the frame rate was improved in the overworld map. The Japanese version was purposefully released on March 3, 2005 (3/3) due to the game being the third unique title in the &quot;Tales&quot; series.

Namco only published the PSP version of the game in Japan; Ubisoft picked up the game for distribution in Europe, and it went unreleased in North America. The game, which had not been released in Europe prior to the PSP release, retained the &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; title, despite &quot;Tales of Destiny II&quot; being used in the prior English language release in North America.

===Audio===
The music of &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura, who had previously collaborated on the soundtracks to both &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; and &quot;Tales of Destiny&quot;. Its Japanese theme song, &quot;Flying&quot; was performed by J-Rock group Garnet Crow, which was replaced in the English versions by an original orchestral piece.

An official soundtrack was released in March 2001 by Marvelous Entertainment containing 109 tracks from the game across two discs. One month later in April 2001, Namco released a second soundtrack by Media Factory called , which featured the same tracks in slightly better quality and arranged in a more logical order closer to how they appear in the game itself. A five-volume radio drama album series called was released between November 2000 and March 2001 by Movic, as well as a two-volume drama series called released from January to February 2002.

==Reception==
===PlayStation version===
&quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was well received in Japan, earning a 33 out of 40 possible score from &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; based on individual reviews of 9, 8, 8, and 8, earning the publication&#x27;s Gold Award. In 2006, the magazine&#x27;s readers voted it the 57th greatest game of all time, and the second highest-ranked &quot;Tales&quot; title released at that point. It sold over 550,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2000, resulting in Sony Computer Entertainment Japan bestowing a Gold Award at the 2001 PlayStation Awards ceremony for selling over 500,000 copies in the region by April 2001. By December 2007, the game had sold over 873,000 copies worldwide.

The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. IGN praised the gameplay, citing &quot;a great action-oriented battle system that has no close equivalent in any other game&quot;. GameSpot recommended it only to people who value gameplay over graphics, stating &quot;it&#x27;s a good bit of fun to play&quot; but it &quot;...would not be out of place on the Super Nintendo about eight years ago&quot; regarding graphics. Namco&#x27;s localization effort was generally seen as sufficient, with the humor of the script translated to the North American audience, but reviewers found the game&#x27;s voice acting to be deficient and unremarkable. AllGame praised the gameplay, character designs, and 2D graphics, but criticized the game&#x27;s weaker, less emphasized story, and the voice acting, stating &quot;It isn&#x27;t that the voice actors do a horrible job, it&#x27;s just that more often than not, they sound as if they&#x27;re waiting to get their oil changed instead of on a life-or-death mission.&quot;

===PlayStation Portable version===
Like its predecessor, the Japanese PlayStation Portable version of &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; received a 33 out of 40 possible score from &quot;Famitsu&quot; based on scores of 8, 8, 9, and 8. The game sold 80,650 copies in its first week, entering the Japanese sales charts as the second-best selling title during that period, and would go on to sell approximately 398,000 copies worldwide by December 2007.

The PSP version also received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Eurogamer said that the game was &quot;...by far and away the best RPG for the PSP currently on the market (as of April 2006)...&quot;, praising the graphics and gameplay, complaining the story felt &quot;cliche&quot; and &quot;rushed&quot;. &quot;PALGN&quot; praised the story of the game, stating, &quot;The story on its own has a few major twists and goes along at a pace that will keep you interested, but it’s not that spectacular, but still has quite a bit of depth&quot; and the game&#x27;s sense of exploration, stating &quot;That’s one of the best things about &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot;. Despite being somewhat linear, you can still go your own way. The depth in the story and in the gameplay itself allow you to really play as you wish.&quot; In 2012, &quot;Game Informer&quot; named Farah one of the best characters in the &quot;Tales&quot; series, calling her &quot;a loveable character with infectious energy.&quot;

==Other media==

===Anime===

A 13 episode anime series produced and animated by Xebec also called &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was inspired by the game; the series originally ran on Japanese television from 8 January 2001 to 26 March 2001. &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was licensed by Media Blasters on 6 July 2002 for North American distribution, but the company&#x27;s license expired and it was never released in the region. The plot of the anime series is completely unrelated to the story of the original game, but contains common elements including the four main characters, Greater Craymels, and spells. A manga version of the anime was released in 2002.

===&quot;Tales of Eternia Online&quot;===
A massively multiplayer online role-playing game set in the world of &quot;Tales of Eternia&quot; was released on March 3, 2006, in only Japan and was active there until March 31, 2007. Subscribers were able to play online for free after paying monthly fees up to January 29, 2007, until the service ended. Japanese media cited &quot;a declining number of accounts&quot;, but the company Bandai Namco Games did not disclose its reasons to shut down the game.

The company partnered with Dwango as of 2004 and performed the game&#x27;s beta testing in early 2005 before the game&#x27;s release. The online game&#x27;s timeline is set around the time when the main characters journey to Celestia. Its gameplay was similar to that of the &quot;Tales&quot; games but tweaked for the online game. It lets players customize their own characters, and small window boxes appear during players&#x27; conversations with each other. The character classes are warriors, skilled at defense against enemy attacks; swordspersons, skilled at attacking; martial artists, skilled at agility and with healing and attack abilities; white sorcerers, with healing and support spells; and magic sorcerers, with attack spells. A party can be formed up to four players, but any player can fight solo. The leader of a party decides whoever can earn experience points and items after battle. The game also features minigames, including one involving cooking with ingredients obtained or purchased during the game. The game required a computer running Windows 98 Second Edition or higher.

<doc id="1225095" wikidata="Q5625352" url="?curid=1225095" title="Gypsy Lore Society">
<text>The Gypsy Lore Society was founded in Great Britain in 1888 to unite persons interested in the history and lore of Gypsies and rovers and to establish closer contacts among scholars studying aspects of such cultures.

== History ==
David MacRitchie was one of its founders in 1888 and he worked with Francis Hindes Groome until 1892 to produce its quarterly journal. From 1892, the organisation was dormant until its revival in 1907, when MacRitchie became its president.

Another early member of the society was the explorer Sir Richard Burton, who wrote from Trieste in 1888: 
The Society had ceased to function during World War I. Robert Andrew Scott Macfie had set it up again round 1906 and John Sampson was its president of 1915. The Romani scholar Dora Esther Yates supported the society&#x27;s revival in 1922 and she became its de facto secretary although this did not happen formally until 1932.

Since 1989 it has been headquartered in the United States. Its goals include promotion of the study of Roma, Gypsies and Travellers. Gypsy Lore Society publications include journal &quot;Romani Studies&quot; continuing Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society and Newsletter of the Gypsy Lore Society. The biannual journal, &quot;Romani Studies,&quot; concerned with disseminating accurate information aimed at increasing understanding of these cultures in their diverse forms. The &quot;Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society&quot; appeared in four series, starting in July 1888. The Society&#x27;s archives are held at the University of Liverpool.

The Gypsy and Traveller cultures represented include those traditionally known as Roma, Sinti, Calé, Romnichels, Ludar, Irish Travellers, Scottish Travellers and others.

The Society also sponsors programmes and conferences. The North American chapter of the Society established the &quot;Victor Weybright Archives of Gypsy Studies&quot; in 1978, specialising in recent scholarly work on Gypsy, Traveller and related studies. This research collection is now housed at the University of Michigan.

The president of the Gypsy Lore Society from 2012 to 2020 was Elena Marushiakova. From 2020 the president of the Gypsy Lore Society is Tatiana Podolinska.

<text>Task analysis is a fundamental tool of human factors engineering. It entails analyzing how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task.

Information from a task analysis can then be used for many purposes, such as personnel selection and training, tool or equipment design, procedure design (e.g., design of checklists, or decision support systems) and automation. Though distinct, task analysis is related to user analysis.

== Safety Critical Task Analysis ==
Safety Critical Task Analysis (SCTA) focuses on how tasks that are critical to major accident risk are performed. SCTA is a crucial assessment designed to predict and understand the role that human error plays in major accidents. This is a type or workshop conducted to support Major Accident Hazard (MAH) industries, such as oil and gas, chemicals. Those activities or tasks that are identified as being safety critical (i.e. may result in significant impact to the environment or harm to people if completed incorrectly), are put through an SCTA which would break down the task into a step-by-step process and review where the most likely points of error are to occur. The aim of this is to identify where additional control measures can be introduced that would reduce the likelihood of human error in completing such an important task. 

The Energy Institute in the UK, has released a guidance document titled &quot;Guidance on Human Factors Safety Critical Analysis&quot;

==Applications==
The term &quot;task&quot; is often used interchangeably with or . Task analysis often results in a hierarchical representation of what steps it takes to perform a task for which there is a goal and for which there is some lowest-level &quot;action&quot; or interaction among humans and/or machines: this is known as hierarchical task analysis. Tasks may be identified and defined at multiple levels of abstraction as required to support the purpose of the analysis. A critical task analysis, for example, is an analysis of human performance requirements which, if not accomplished in accordance with system requirements, will likely have adverse effects on cost, system reliability, efficiency, effectiveness, or safety. Task analysis is often performed by human factors and ergonomics professionals.

Task analysis may be of manual tasks, such as bricklaying, and be analyzed as time and motion studies using concepts from industrial engineering. Cognitive task analysis is applied to modern work environments such as supervisory control where little physical work occurs, but the tasks are more related to situation assessment, decision making, and response planning and execution.

Task analysis is also used in education. It is a model that is applied to classroom tasks to discover which curriculum components are well matched to the capabilities of students with learning disabilities and which task modification might be necessary. It discovers which tasks a person hasn&#x27;t mastered, and the information processing demands of tasks that are easy or problematic. In behavior modification, it is a breakdown of a complex behavioral sequence into steps. This often serves as the basis for chaining.

The results of task analysis are often represented in task models, which clearly indicate the relations among the various tasks, An example notation used to specify task models is ConcurTaskTrees (by Fabio Paternò), which is also supported by tools that are freely available.

For Inclusion

Knowing how to do Task Analysis is a fundamental skill in inclusive teaching. In fact, it consists of a backward composition of the objective which leads to the construction of a map (Plan), that is, a sequence of simpler actions and abilities to achieve a specific objective.

For the Task Analysis it is necessary to clearly identify which are the prerequisites for the activity: essential prerequisites (knowledge, skills and competences of the student) and support prerequisites (environmental facilitators). It therefore requires to organize teaching and also an indispensable flexibility.

There are also three approaches: technical (students are passive tools), socio-relational (students are motivated to participate), sociotechnical (an intermediate way in which students are able to make decisions and solve problems).

The advantages

* Perform a division into sequences.
* Identify the precise moment in which the problem occurs (behavior analysis, systematic observation) and be able to intervene effectively and efficiently.
* Establish a progression of correct and gradual learning objectives.
* Immediately provides for the inclusion of special environmental facilitators.
* Move from the concrete level to the graphic coding of the experience and to metacognition.

==Versus work domain analysis==
If task analysis is likened to a set of instructions on how to navigate from Point A to Point B, then Work domain analysis (WDA) is like having a map of the terrain that includes Point A and Point B. WDA is broader and focuses on the environmental constraints and opportunities for behavior, as in Gibsonian ecological psychology and ecological interface design (Vicente, 1999; Bennett &amp; Flach, 2011, p. 61)

==Documentation==
Since the 1980s, a major change in technical documentation has been to emphasize the tasks performed with a system rather than documenting the system itself. In software documentation particularly, long printed technical manuals that exhaustively describe every function of the software are being replaced by online help organized into tasks. This is part of the new emphasis on usability and user-centered design rather than system/software/product design.

This task orientation in technical documentation began with publishing guidelines issued by IBM in the late 1980s. Later IBM studies led to John Carroll&#x27;s theory of minimalism in the 1990s.

With the development of XML as a markup language suitable for both print and online documentation (replacing SGML with its focus on print), IBM developed the Darwin Information Typing Architecture XML standard in 2000. Now an OASIS standard, DITA has a strong emphasis on task analysis. Its three basic information types are Task, Concept, and Reference. Tasks are analyzed into steps, with a main goal of identifying steps that are reusable in multiple tasks.

==Hierarchical task analysis==
Hierarchical task analysis (HTA) is a task description method and a variant of task analysis. Task description is a necessary precursor for other analysis techniques, including critical path analysis (CPA). HTA is used to produce an exhaustive description of tasks in a hierarchical structure of goals, sub-goals, operations and plans. In HTA, tasks are broken down into progressively smaller units.

===Operations and plans===
Operations are the actions performed by people interacting with a system or by the system itself, and plans explain the conditions necessary for these operations. Operations describe the smallest individual task steps in the HTA, i.e. those which cannot be broken down into plans and further operations. They are the individual actions, such as &#x27;visually locate control&#x27; or &#x27;move hand to control&#x27;, which the user must perform in a particular combination to achieve the goal of task completion.

===Applying===
The following steps should be followed when conducting a HTA:
:# Define the task under investigation and identify the purpose of the task analysis. The analyst should have some further evaluation methods in mind for which the HTA will be useful and should have reason for needing this type of analysis to be performed.
:# Data collection – In order to carry out the HTA it is necessary to obtain data on how the task is performed. This could be collected via observation of the task in question or from a detailed specification of the device under analysis. Alternatively, interviews or questionnaires with people that have first-hand experience of performing that task could be conducted to gather the necessary detail.
:# Define the overall task goal, which will be presented as the top level in the HTA. An example might be &quot;increase fan speed by two steps&quot;. This describes what is being achieved by performing the task; however, at this stage there is no indication of how the task will be performed.
:# Determine the next level of sub-goals by breaking down the overall goal. A sub-goal for the above example might be &quot;open the climate menu&quot;. This provides more information about how to accomplish the task; however, it can still be broken down into smaller units, which will describe the individual operations (performed via the visual, manual or cognitive modes) that need to be performed.
:# Continue breaking down the sub-goals until all operations are identified. Operations in the &quot;reduce fan speed task&quot; will include &quot;move finger to climate menu button&quot; and &quot;touch climate menu button&quot;. 
:# Define plans to describe how to perform the operations in each sub-goal level of the hierarchy. In the fan speed example, the two operations will have to be performed in series, one after the other. The plan will instruct the user to &quot;perform 1, then 2&quot;. Operations can also be performed in parallel, and in this case the plan would instruct the user to &quot;perform 1 and 2 together&quot;. Numbers should be assigned to the different levels in the hierarchy.

====Organising the hierarchy====
Each level in the HTA should be numbered according to its hierarchical level: The overall goal is the highest hierarchical level and should be numbered 0. The first sub-goal in the hierarchy will be 1, also with plan 1. Further levels just extend this system - third hierarchical level: 1.1, fourth hierarchical level: 1.1.1, and so on. A HTA can be represented in list or diagram form. In list form lines should be indented to denote the different hierarchical levels. In diagram form each operation should be placed within a box and links should be made between them: a lower hierarchical level should branch from underneath a higher level operation. Plans should be written next to the branches to describe the way in which the branched operations should be carried out. Hence, the plans should be goal oriented to achieve the success of any field.

===Applications and limitations===
HTA is a task description method which is most commonly used as a starting point for further analyses such as multimodal CPA and SHERPA. On its own, HTA does not provide results for usability evaluation; however, you should be able to study the HTA in order to learn about the structure of different tasks. It may also allow you to highlight unnecessary task steps or potential errors that might occur in task performance. HTA is a fairly time-consuming method to carry out as each individual operation in a task needs to be analysed; however, creating a comprehensive HTA can considerably reduce the time required for other modelling methods.
