<text>The Royal Alexandra Theatre, commonly known as the Royal Alex, is an historic performing arts theatre in Toronto, Ontario. The theatre is located at 260 King Street West, in the downtown Toronto Entertainment District. Owned and operated by Mirvish Productions, the theatre has approximately 1,244 seats across three levels. Built in 1907, the Royal Alexandra Theatre is the oldest continuously operating legitimate theatre in North America.

==History==
The Royal Alex is a 1,244-seat, beaux-arts style, proscenium-stage theatre, with two balcony levels, built in the style typical of 19th century British theatres. Construction began in 1905 and was completed in 1907. Since 1963 it has been owned by Ed Mirvish Enterprises, a company established by Toronto department store owner Edwin Mirvish. Since 1986, the theatre has been managed and operated by Mirvish Productions, the theatre production company headed by Ed&#x27;s son, David Mirvish. The theatre, commonly known as the &quot;Royal Alex&quot;, &quot;the Alex&quot; or &quot;the R.A.T.&quot; is named for Queen Alexandra, a Danish princess who was the wife of King Edward VII, and the great-great-grandmother of the current King of Canada, Charles III. The theatre received letters patent from Edward VII entitling it to the royal designation. Its present owners believe that it is the only remaining legally &quot;royal theatre&quot; in North America.

At the time of its opening, the Royal Alex was in an upscale neighbourhood. The mansion of Ontario&#x27;s lieutenant-governor was nearby, the Ontario legislative buildings had been there until 1893, the upper-class St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church and the Princess Theatre, Toronto&#x27;s finest &quot;first-class&quot; showplace were also in the vicinity. The theatre was built on what had previously been the athletic field of the exclusive boys&#x27; school Upper Canada College near the corner of King and Simcoe streets. This intersection was then known as &quot;the crossroads of Education, Legislation, Salvation and Damnation&quot; - &quot;Education&quot; for Upper Canada College; &quot;Legislation&quot; for the parliament buildings; &quot;Salvation&quot; for St. Andrew&#x27;s; and &quot;Damnation&quot; for a tavern, popular with actors from the Princess Theatre, that then stood on the northeast corner of the crossroads.

The construction of the Royal Alex was financed by a group of business leaders who sought to &quot;put Toronto on the map&quot; as a place of culture and refinement. The principal of this group was Cawthra Mulock, a 21-year-old foundry owner, scion of two of Ontario&#x27;s most prominent families (the Cawthras and the Mulocks) who lived a short walk east of site in a large home called &quot;Cawthra House&quot;, locally famed for its doorknobs of solid gold. Other members of the syndicate included Robert Alexander Smith, Stephen Haas, and Lawrence &quot;Lol&quot; Solman. Solman would manage the theatre from 1907 until his death in 1931.

The architect chosen by Mulock and his group was the young John McIntosh Lyle, born in Belfast, reared in Hamilton, Ontario, and educated at Yale University and Paris&#x27; École des Beaux-Arts. Lyle was an associate with the New York architectural firm Carrère and Hastings, the official architects of the theatre. Mulock gave Lyle a budget of $750,000 and the simple instruction &quot;Build me the finest theatre on the continent.&quot; He also, however, insisted that the theatre be built on a steel frame, as a demonstration of the products of his foundry.

Lyle greatly overspent his budget, but delivered a structure described in later years as &quot;an Edwardian jewel-box.&quot; The interior featured an Italian marble lobby; Venetian mosaic floors; elaborately carved walnut and cherrywood stairs and railings; silk wallpapers; ornate, gilded plasterwork; and an enormous sounding-board mural (&quot;Venus and Attendants Discover the Sleeping Adonis&quot;) by the popular Canadian painter Frederick S. Challener. Lyle also incorporated a number of &quot;firsts&quot; into his design: the Alex was North America&#x27;s first air-conditioned theatre (by virtue of a large ice-pit under the orchestra), one of its first &quot;fireproof&quot; theatres, and the first on the continent (thanks to the steel framing) to employ cantilevered balconies, with no internal pillars to interfere with lines of sight.

The theatre opened on August 26, 1907. Its first presentation was a pantomime &quot;spectacle&quot; titled &quot;Top O&#x27;Th&#x27; World&quot;, starring Anna Laughlin, heading a cast of 65. During its early years, the Royal Alex had great difficulty in booking acts for its stage. The theatre owners found themselves at odds with the powerful Theatrical Syndicate, the New York-based organisation headed by Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, Abe Erlanger, Mark Klaw, Samuel F. Nixon and Fred Zimmerman that not only exercised a near monopoly on touring theatre in North America, but also had a financial interest in the rival Princess Theatre, two blocks east of the Royal Alexandra. The manager of the Alex, Lawrence &quot;Lol&quot; Solman, allied his theatre with the Syndicate&#x27;s chief challengers, the Shubert brothers. For this impertinence, Solman later wrote, Abe Erlanger threatened to drive the Alex into bankruptcy and turn it into a stable for the horses of the carriage-trade patrons of the Princess.

The local rivalry with the Princess Theatre ended on the night of May 7, 1915, when a fire gutted that theatre, leaving the Royal Alex as Toronto&#x27;s only first-class, legitimate playhouse. By coincidence, on that same evening, the British liner sank in the Irish Sea after being struck by a torpedo. One of those killed in the disaster was Syndicate partner and creative head Charles Frohman.

Over the 1940s and &#x27;50s, the Royal Alex declined - as did so many regional theatres, unable to compete with cinema, radio and television - into hard times. The neighbourhood surrounding the theatre also went into decline, becoming dominated by railway marshalling yards, warehouses and light industry that had moved to the area following the Great Toronto Fire of 1904. In 1962, after a decade of money-losing operation, the trustees of the Mulock estate (Cawthra Mulock died during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918) put the theatre up for sale. The theatre was to have been demolished for a parking lot. The property was purchased by Ed Mirvish in 1963, owner of the Toronto discount shop Honest Ed&#x27;s for the sum of $250,000. Mirvish said at the time that he knew nothing about theatre—had never even been inside a theatre—but knew a bargain when he saw one.

As a condition of the sale, Ed Mirvish pledged to continue operating the Royal Alex as a legitimate theatre for at least five years. If, at the end of that time, he was unwilling to continue, he was then permitted to demolish the building and use the site for other purposes. Mirvish closed the theatre for one year - the longest it had ever been dark - for renovation and restoration. The Royal Alex re-opened in September, 1963, with the comedy &quot;Never Too Late&quot;, starring William Bendix and produced by Ed Mirvish.

Ed Mirvish rarely after ventured into production, but used the theatre - as it had always been used - as a road house, booking in touring shows and pre-Broadway tryouts. He also allowed the theatre to be used by local companies - including the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada - and made the Alex the home, for many years, of the popular annual Toronto revue &quot;Spring Thaw&quot;. He did, however, achieve notable success as a producer with &quot;Hair&quot; in 1970, and &quot;Godspell&quot; in 1972. The latter starred a group of young Canadian unknowns who would go on to great success, including Victor Garber, Gilda Radner, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Andrea Martin.

Following the renovation of the Royal Alex, Mirvish purchased, one by one, the warehouse and industrial buildings along King St. to the west of the theatre. In these, he opened a group of colourful restaurants—including Ed&#x27;s Warehouse, Ed&#x27;s Folly and Old Ed&#x27;s—in a successful effort to draw people back into the neighbourhood. The last of these restaurants closed in 2000 by which point the area around the Royal Alex had been transformed from abandoned warehouses into a district of independent winebars, restaurants, cafes and bistros.

In 1975, Toronto City Council recognized the historic value of the theatre by designating it under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; by By-law 512-75. In 1987, on the 80th anniversary of the theatre, it was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

Ed Mirvish and his son David Mirvish, added a second theatre to the family interests in 1982, when they purchased and restored London, England&#x27;s historic Old Vic. In 1986, David Mirvish created the company Mirvish Productions to produce original, &quot;sit-down&quot; plays and musicals for the Royal Alexandra. Ed Mirvish retired from active participation in the theatres in 1987, handing the business to his son. In 1993, David Mirvish added a third theatre to the empire, building the Princess of Wales Theatre a block to the west of the Royal Alexandra. The Princess was named, in part, in memory of the old Princess, rival to the Alex in the early years of the 20th century.

The theatre&#x27;s managers have been Lawrence Solman 1907-1931, William Breen 1933-1939, Ernest Rawley 1939-1963, Edwin De Rocher 1963-1969, Yale Simpson 1969-1989, Graham Hall 1989-1994, Ron Jacobson 1994–present.

=== 2016 renovation ===
On May 15, 2016, following the conclusion of &quot;Kinky Boots&quot;″ run at the theatre, the Royal Alexandra closed to undergo a $2.5 million renovation. David Mirvish explained that the renovation was intended to &quot;once more restore and give life to that sparkle and give a level of comfort that will preserve the theatre as our flagship of the 21st century&quot;. The most significant change was the refurbishment of its seating areas to improve audience comfort, with the replacement of its original seats with modern versions that are larger and arranged to increase legroom. The new seating layout necessitated a reduction in capacity from 1,497 to 1,244; David contrasted it to the trend of theatres increasing their capacity to &quot;maximize&quot; revenue, arguing that the improved amenities would build improve customer loyalty and encourage repeat visits.

The theatre re-opened on November 15, 2016 with the opening of &quot;Come from Away&quot;; the pre-Broadway run for the show set sales records for the Royal Alex, selling out its entire run within only its second week of shows, and $1.7 million worth of tickets in a week.

<text>&quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth (Stop, Hey What&#x27;s That Sound)&quot; (often referred to as simply &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;) is a song written by Stephen Stills. Performed by Buffalo Springfield, it was recorded on December 5, 1966, released as a single on Atco Records in December1966 and peaked at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the spring of 1967. Its association with the Vietnam War is a popular misconception; the song is about young people clashing with police during the counterculture era.

It was later added to the March 1967 second pressing of their first album, &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot;. The title was added after the song was written, and does not appear in the lyrics.

In 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the song at number 63 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Background==
Although &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; is often considered an anti-war song, Stephen Stills was inspired to write the song because of the Sunset Strip curfew riots in Los Angeles in November 1966, a series of early counterculture-era clashes that took place between police and young people on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California, the same year Buffalo Springfield had become the house band at the Whisky a Go Go. Local residents and businesses had become annoyed by how crowds of young people going to clubs and music venues along the Strip had caused late-night traffic congestion. In response, they lobbied Los Angeles County to pass local ordinances stopping loitering, and enforced a strict curfew on the Strip after 10 p.m. The young music fans, however, felt the new laws infringed upon their civil rights.

On Saturday, November 12, 1966, fliers were distributed on the Sunset Strip inviting people to join demonstrations later that day. Several of Los Angeles&#x27;s rock radio stations also announced a rally outside the Pandora&#x27;s Box club on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights. That evening, as many as 1,000 young demonstrators, including future celebrities such as Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda (who was handcuffed by police) gathered to protest against the curfew&#x27;s enforcement. Although the rallies began peacefully, trouble eventually broke out. The unrest continued the next night, and periodically throughout the rest of November and December, forcing some clubs to shut down within weeks. It was against the background of these civil disturbances that Stills recorded &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; on December 5, 1966.

==Production==
Stills said in an interview that the name of the song came about when he presented it to the record company executive Ahmet Ertegun (who signed Buffalo Springfield to the Atlantic Records-owned ATCO label). Stills said &quot;I have this song here, for what it&#x27;s worth, if you want it.&quot; Another producer, Charlie Greene, claims that Stills first said the above line to him, but credits Ahmet Ertegun with giving the single the parenthetical subtitle &quot;Stop, Hey What&#x27;s That Sound&quot; so that the song would be more easily recognized.

The song was recorded on December 5, 1966, at Columbia Studios, Hollywood. Tom Dowd claimed he mixed the song at Atlantic&#x27;s studio in New York, though this has been disputed. Dowd did take part in the production of Cher&#x27;s version of the song in 1969. One of the most recognizable elements of the song is Neil Young&#x27;s use of guitar harmonics.

==Releases and charts==
While memories of the November riots were still fresh, the group and Ertegun pushed for a rush-release of &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;. On December 10, 1966, five days after the song was recorded, local Top 40 radio station KHJ began playing the single. It first appeared on the station&#x27;s &quot;Boss 30&quot; chart on December 28, 1966, at number 26, and was followed by rival KRLA on January 14, 1967, where the single entered its &quot;Top 40 Requests&quot; at number eight. Also on January 14, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine identified it as a &quot;regional breakout&quot; and the single appeared on its Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart. Two weeks later, it debuted at number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at number seven on March 25 and remained on the chart for a total of fifteen weeks. Although the single did not reach the charts in the U.K., the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified a 2004 release by Warner Music as platinum (sales and streams of 600,000) in 2023.



To capitalize on the single&#x27;s success, Atco was pushing for a follow-up album that featured the song. It began printing album jackets with the title &quot;Stampede&quot;, but the group did not have enough songs for a new LP. Instead, Atco reissued their debut album and added Stills&#x27;s song as the opening track. It eventually reached number 80 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs chart. As one of Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s best-known songs, it is included on several of the group&#x27;s anthologies, such as &quot;&quot; (1969), the &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; box set (2001), and &quot;What&#x27;s That Sound? Complete Albums Collection&quot; (2018).

==Critical commentary and legacy==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said the single is a &quot;throbbing, infectious protester circling &#x27;round the current happenings in Cal.&quot;

&quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; quickly became a well-known protest song. However, contrary to popular belief, the song was not motivated by the Vietnam War, but rather a confrontation Stills had in Los Angeles&#x27; Sunset Strip neighborhood. In 2006, when interviewed on Tom Kent&#x27;s radio show &quot;Into the &#x27;70s&quot;, Stills pointed out that many people think the song is about the Kent State shootings of 1970, even though its release predates that event by over three years. Neil Young—Stills&#x27;s bandmate in both Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY)—would later write &quot;Ohio&quot; in response to the events at Kent State.

An all-star version of &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, with Tom Petty and others, was played at Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; Neil Young did not attend the event.

The song is a staple of period piece films about 1960s America and the Vietnam War, such as &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, and often used as a common shorthand to quickly establish the atmosphere of 1960s counterculture movement and protests.

The song appears in the intro to the 2005 film &quot;Lord of War&quot;, showing the lifecycle of a rifle cartridge, from manufacture to firing.

On August 17, 2020, Billy Porter sang &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; for the 2020 Democratic National Convention backed by Stephen Stills on guitar, a nod to the song&#x27;s resurgent use in the summer 2020 American protests.

In 2000, the 1966 recording of &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; by Buffalo Springfield on ATCO Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The HOF lists the ATCO date as 1967.

Dawes, alongside Stephen Stills and Mike Campbell performed the song on January 30, 2025 at Kia Forum in Inglewood, California for FireAid to help with relief efforts for the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Covers and sampling==
&quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; has been covered, sampled, and referenced in numerous musical performances. Versions include those by The Staple Singers (US #66 in 1967, CAN #46 in 1967), Art (1967 single from &quot;Supernatural Fairy Tales&quot;), King Curtis (in the 1967 album &quot;King Sized Soul&quot;), Ken Lyon &amp; Tombstone, Rush, Cher, the Candyskins, Oui 3 (UK #28), Queensrÿche (on their album &quot;Take Cover&quot;), Miriam Makeba (on her album &quot;Keep Me in Mind&quot;), Ozzy Osbourne and (həd) p.e. (retitled &quot;Children&quot;). Cher&#x27;s 1969 cover did not make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but it did reach #88 in Canada. AllMusic retrospectively called her version &quot;mature [and] forceful&quot;.

Sergio Mendes and Brasil&#x27;66 recorded a version of this song. It reached #10 in the Adult Contemporary Music Chart on September 19, 1970. Singer Karen Philipp suggested to Sergio that he should cover the song. Karen does all of the vocals for this song by overdubbing. Two versions of this song exist: The mono 45 has a more extreme overdubbing of Karen&#x27;s vocals with a different organ solo than the LP. The LP version is in stereo with a different vocal arrangement.

David Cassidy recorded an extended live version for his 1974 album &quot;Cassidy Live!&quot; (Bell Records, UK #9; recorded live in Great Britain in May 1974).

On episode 2.21 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, originally airing 19 February 1978, &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; is performed by an opossum (Jerry Nelson) and a chorus of woodland animals. The second and third verses are rewritten by an uncredited writer to give the song an anti-hunting theme.

The hip-hop group Public Enemy sampled &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; on their 1998 song &quot;He Got Game&quot;, which featured Stephen Stills reprising his vocal performance from the original song. Oui 3 adapted the song for their 1993 debut single of the same name, which reached number 26 in the UK chart.
In 2017, Haley Reinhart released a cover of the song as the third single from her third studio album, &quot;What&#x27;s That Sound?&quot; In 2018, the Lone Bellow released a cover of the song as a single. In 2022 Stevie Nicks released a cover of it as well, not to be confused with her 2011 song of the same name.

<doc id="1215272" wikidata="Q8996" url="?curid=1215272" title="Doncaster Sheffield Airport">
<text>Doncaster Sheffield Airport , formerly named and commonly referred to as Robin Hood Airport, was an international airport in Finningley near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England, in operation between 2005 and 2022. The site lies south-east of the centre of Doncaster and east of Sheffield.

==History==
===1915–1995: RAF Finningley===

The airport was opened as Finningley Airfield in 1915.

During the First World War, it was a base for the Royal Flying Corps to intercept German Zeppelins targeting industrial cities of Northern England. In the Second World War the airfield was primarily used for training, serving RAF Bomber Command crews; only a few combat missions took off. It was a key facility for nuclear-armed Vulcan bombers in the Cold War before downgrade to training in the 1970s / 1980s and decommissioning by 1995.

The long runway was a Space Shuttle emergency landing site.

===2005–2016: Robin Hood Airport===
Following the end of scheduled services from Sheffield City Airport, Peel Group opened former RAF Finningley as Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield in April 2005. The Robin Hood label controversially referenced historical accounts placing him in nearby Barnsdale Forest not Sherwood Forest but 11,000 people petitioned to oppose the name. In May 2006, Thomsonfly launched the first long-haul flight from Doncaster to Puerto Plata.

Promoters initially hoped for 25 million passengers a year. In 2007, one million used the airport. This decreased to 700,000 in 2012, before increasing to just 1.25 million in 2016.

===2016–2022: Doncaster Sheffield Airport===
In December 2016, Robin Hood Airport rebranded as Doncaster Sheffield Airport.

Flybe closed its facility at the airport in 2019, relocating crew and aircraft, though Wizz Air based two aircraft there in 2020. However in 2022, it too announced the end of flights from the airport stating the airport operators were &quot;unable to guarantee the terms of its commercial agreement&quot;. That left TUI Airways as the airport&#x27;s sole regular customer.

After an extended review and public consultation, Peel proposed an expansion of their adjacent Gateway East property development and the airport closed. TUI operated the final flights on 4 November 2022, and Wizz Air transferred its routes to Leeds Bradford Airport.

Doncaster Council applied for judicial review of the closure process but was refused. In response, the Mayor of Doncaster announced the council&#x27;s intention to compulsory purchase.

Nevertheless, air traffic control was withdrawn from the airport in December 2022, and the Civil Aviation Authority began to reclassify surrounding airspace.

===Post-closure===
After protracted negotiation, in March 2024 the Mayor of Doncaster obtained a 125 year lease over the airport. That November, the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority agreed to £3m funding of reinstatement activities and commercial negotiation, as part of a £138m re-opening budget.

On 6 December 2024, a utility aircraft, operated by 2Excel Aviation, landed at the airport, the first in over 2 years.

In February 2025, Munich Airport International were appointed airport operators for a potential reopening in spring 2026. However, several industry commentators questioned Doncaster Sheffield Airport&#x27;s viability.

==Facilities==

The airport has a single runway designated 02/20, with dimensions of . It was designed for long-range nuclear armed bombers and so is wider than other commercial airports in the north of England.

The passenger terminal has 24 check-in desks, six departure gates and three baggage carousels.

A 102-bed Ramada Encore hotel opened in 2008. It is situated less than ten minutes walk from the Terminal building but is now used to hold immigrants awaiting decisions on their asylum cases.

There are four on-site car parks.

===Airport business park===
In 2014, a site on the airport&#x27;s business park became part of Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone.

===Hangars===
No. 3 Hangar was occupied by 2Excel Aviation providing Design, production and Maintenance services.
Defence company BAE Systems formerly operated its Aircraft Maintenance Academy from No. 3 Hangar at the airport, before moving to Humberside Airport. Other activities within the hangars included from 2012, a Cessna Citation service centre.

===Flight training===
The airport was home to Yorkshire Aero Club and Hummingbird Helicopters.

==Statistics==
===Traffic statistics===


===Busiest routes===
==Vulcan XH558==

In 2011, the Vulcan to the Sky Trust flew Avro Vulcan XH558 to the airport, its former operational base. It was the last airworthy example of the Vulcan bomber fleet, restored to flight by the trust in 2007. XH558&#x27;s final flight was a display over the airport, on 28 October 2015.

In 2022, the trust announced it would leave the airport because its lease could not be renewed. Nevertheless, as of October 2024, the trust and XH558 remained at the airport awaiting negotiations with a new operator.

==Transport==

The airport is close to M18 motorway junction 3 and a road to it was completed in 2018.

Doncaster railway station on the East Coast Main Line, and the Frenchgate Interchange are away.

The airport abuts the Doncaster to Lincoln railway line, and plans for a station to replace one that closed in 1961 were granted planning permission in 2008. However, a 2012 report by Network Rail stated that more trains on the line would be required to make it viable. There have been proposals for a dedicated link to the East Coast Main Line.

==Accident==
On 15 August 2014, Jestream 31 G–GAVA, operating a Links Air flight from Belfast City Airport, crashed on landing at the airport following a landing gear failure; this caused substantial damage to the aircraft. One passenger was taken to hospital with minor injuries. The airport was closed for several hours.

==In media==
In 2007, the airport featured in the BBC Two documentary &quot;Should I Really Give Up Flying?&quot; Brian Blessed explored local attitudes to flying and its impact on the environment.

It has been a location for television series including ITV&#x27;s &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, BBC One&#x27;s drama &quot;Hustle&quot; and &quot;In the Club&quot;.

The airport appeared in &quot;Four Lions&quot; and was a settings for the BBC mockumentary &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;. Matt Lucas and David Walliams spent two weeks at the airport filming.

RAF Finningley was destroyed by a Soviet nuclear warhead in 1984 TV film &quot;Threads&quot;.

<text>Ryu Si-won (; born 6 October 1972) is a South Korean actor and singer. After he made his debut in the KBS drama &quot;Feeling&quot; in 1994, Ryu pursued a singing career.

==Early life==
Ryu was born in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. He is from the Pungsan Ryu clan and is the 13th-generation descendant of Joseon Dynasty prime minister Ryu Sŏngnyong.

==Career==
Ryu&#x27;s acting career began in 1994 with a supporting role in the TV series &#x27;, as a friend of one of the main characters. Kim Hyeong-seok, the show&#x27;s music director, recommended Ryu to the show&#x27;s producer, Yoon Seok-ho, and Yoon cast Ryu right after seeing Ryu&#x27;s audition. While &quot;Feelings&quot; was airing, he was cast as a leading role in the series &#x27;, which aired in 1995. He gained further popularity with his roles in the daily drama &#x27; and the miniseries &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;. During this period, he also debuted as a musician, and hosted programs such as SBS&#x27;s &quot;TV Gayo 20&quot; (the predecessor to Inkigayo) and KBS&#x27;s &quot;Music Bank&quot;.

Subsequent to the 2004 broadcast of his drama &quot;Beautiful Days&quot; in Japan, he started activities there both as an actor and a singer. He was the first Korean artist to hold two live concerts at the Tokyo Dome, in December 2008. Then in November 2011, he held his 100th solo concert in Japan as part of his 16 concert tour in eight cities, including Yokohama, Nigata, Osaka, Sendai, Nagoya, and Fukuoka; with the final concert on 21 December at Saitama Super Arena.

On 21 December 2011, Ryu was signed on by Japanese travel agency HIS, for one-year to promotion Korean tourism in Japan. Where he was featured in two 15-second commercials in the themes of &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Korea&quot; and &quot;You are the character of your drama&quot; for Japanese television in January 2012.

In May 2012, Ryu starred in Channel A&#x27;s drama &quot;Goodbye Dear Wife&quot; along with Hong Soo-hyun, Park Ji-yoon, Danny Ahn and Julien Kang. He played the role of judo teacher Cha Seung-hyuk who dreams of reuniting with his first love.

== Personal life ==
On 6 October 2010, Ryu announced his marriage to a non-celebrity on his fan club&#x27;s website. He officially married on October 26, with celebrities such as Eugene, Kang Ho-dong, and Kim Won-jun attending. Their first child was born on 28 January 2011, 3 months after their marriage. Ryu&#x27;s wife filed for divorce on 22 March 2012. Ryu&#x27;s wife filed another suit on blackmail charges in February 2013, as well as accusing Ryu of threatening her. In May 2013, Ryu was indicted for secretly tracking his wife with a GPS device and using violence on her when she found out. The court ordered him to pay 7 million won for the charges in September, but he appealed the decision. The appeal was rejected, and in 2014, the Supreme Court maintained its original ruling, in accord with a lesser court&#x27;s decision. Ryu counter-sued his wife for perjury, and she was fined in 2015. The divorce lawsuit officially ended in January 2015.

Ryu remarried on 15 February 2020 to a non-celebrity. Their daughter was born on 11 December 2024.

<text>Sardar Bahadur Ishar Singh VC, OBI (30 December 1895 – 2 December 1963) was a soldier in the British Indian Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born at Nainwa, he was the first Sikh to receive the Victoria Cross.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 25 years old, and a sepoy in the 28th Punjabis, Indian Army during the Waziristan Campaign when, on 10 April 1921, near Haidari Kach he undertook the actions which led his senior officer, Captain Bernard Oddie, to recommend him for the award of a VC. The citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 25 November 1921:

He later achieved the rank of captain, and served in the Second World War. In addition to the Victoria Cross, he was awarded the prestigious Order of British India, First Class, which carried with it the title of &quot;Sardar Bahadur.&quot;

His medal is held in the collection of Lord Ashcroft.

<text>Godfrey Meynell (20 May 1904 – 29 September 1935) was a British Indian Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Meynell was the son of an army officer who was also named Godfrey Meynell, by his wife Edith Violet Cammell. He won a scholarship to Eton College. He was commended to Cyril Connolly when he arrived there as a boy with character. After an initial amount of bullying by Meynell of Connolly the two became firm friends as described in &quot;Enemies of Promise&quot;.

==Military career==
Meynell had graduated 13th at Sandhurst before he volunteered for the British Indian Army. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1933 for his work in Chitral.

===Victoria Cross===
Meynell was thirty-one years old, and a captain in the 5th Battalion (Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides), 12th Frontier Force Regiment during the 1935 Mohmand Campaign in British India. He married &quot;Jill&quot;, Sophia Patricia (Jill) Lowis, at the Guides Chapel in Mardan on 31 January 1933; both were speakers of Urdu. Their eldest son Godfrey was born on 20 July 1934.

On 29 September 1935 at Mohmand, in the Nahaqi Pass within the Khyber Pass on the North West Frontier, in the final phase of an attack, Meynell, seeking information on the most forward troops, found them involved in a struggle against an enemy vastly superior in numbers. He at once took command, and with two Lewis guns and about thirty men, maintained a heavy and accurate fire on the advancing enemy, whose overwhelming numbers nevertheless succeeded in reaching the position and putting the Lewis guns out of action. In the hand-to-hand struggle which ensued, Meynell was mortally wounded, but the heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy prevented them from exploiting their success.

His body is laid to rest at the Guides Chapel in Mardan, near Peshawar in the North West Frontier Province (of what is now Pakistan), where he and his wife were married.

Three months after he was killed, news of the award of the VC arrived at Meynell Langley on 24 December 1935. Three months later their second son, Hugo Anthony Meynell, was born on 24 March 1936. His widow received the VC at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 14 July 1936, the only one to be handed out by Edward VIII.

<doc id="1215286" wikidata="Q2354707" url="?curid=1215286" title="Gnav">
<text>Gnav is a traditional Danish and Norwegian social game that has been played with either special cards or wooden pieces with similar motifs. Gnav packs appeared after 1820 and the game was popular until c. 1920. The game can be played by 20 or more players, and a minimum of two. Today, only the playing card version is available in Norway.

Gnav descends from the 18th century Italian card game of Cuccù, played with bespoke packs, which, in turn is based on a much older French game called Mécontent, the precursor to Coucou.

== History ==

The origins of Gnav lie in the French children&#x27;s card game of Mécontent (&quot;Malcontent&quot; i.e. &quot;unhappy&quot;) whose first references date to the early 16th century. This game had migrated to Italy by the mid-16th century where it was named &quot;Malcontento&quot; but it was in the early 18th century that the first dedicated decks for what became known as Cuccù (Cuckoo) appeared; the pack consisting of 38 cards. As in the original game, suits were irrelevant but rank was important. The new pack consisted of two identical sequences of 19 cards each, including a Fool. The game was also known to be played with wooden pieces in Venice during the late 18th century, possibly as a way of avoiding the stamp tax.

Since the game was popular among sailors and mercenaries in the eighteenth century, it spread rapidly to other parts of Europe, changing its name and generating local variations in the number of cards or images portrayed. By the time it had reached Denmark as &quot;Gniao&quot; (Italian for miaow), it had 42 cards; the earliest packs being produced by Jacob Holmblad in the 1820s or 1830s. The game became known as Gnav when the game was taken to Norway by Danish officials in the days when the two countries were united as Denmark-Norway. At that time it was played with both cards and men (playing pieces resembling chess pawns). The latter probably originated under Christian VI (1730–1746), the Pietist king, during whose reign a ban on card games was introduced to lessen the misery of reckless gambling, but the game&#x27;s popularity among commoners meant that it was given a new life as a game with pieces, the images being glued to the base so they could not be seen when stood up. The men were usually kept in a leather bag. Since it was no longer a card game, it was even allowed to be played on Sundays and over Christmas. As a result, it changed from a gambling game to a children&#x27;s game during the 19th century and it is still seen as a game for the Christmas season today. In Norway, both the card game and variant using pieces are still played. Gnav was also taken to the Netherlands where it became known as &quot;Slabberjan&quot;.

The game is first mentioned in Sweden in 1741, as Cambio (Italian for &quot;&quot;), also called Campio, Camphio, Camfio or Kamfio. In 1833 this became Kille (probably a distortion of &quot;Harlequin&quot;, given the special rules for that card in the Swedish version of the game), which became the common form of the game around 1850.

In 1979, a new Gnav pack, designed by Astrid Pilegaard Larsen, was produced to coincide with a games exhibition, with the intention of rescuing the game from obscurity. Gnav packs are still available in Norway today.

== Equipment ==
The wooden pieces, in the piece version of the game, resemble the pawns in chess, with the identity of the piece being written on the base and thus invisible during play. In the card version of the game, the pack comprises 42 cards consisting of two sets of 21 distinct cards ranking, from highest to lowest, as follows:

== Rules ==
Each player receives a single card (or take a wooden piece from a bag) at random, and examines its value. If a player is dealt the Fool, they must knock the table to alert other players to this fact. Players also receive equal supplies of counters. Play then proceeds by turns, starting to the left of the dealer. In turn, a player may either choose to keep the card dealt, by saying &quot;stand&quot; (&quot;jeg står&quot;), or swap it with the left-hand neighbour by saying &quot;change&quot; (&quot;jeg byte&quot;). Play continues until reaching the dealer, who has the choice of keeping the card dealt or exchanging it with the top card of the stock, drawing another card if a Horse or House is drawn. The dealer&#x27;s turn ends the round.

If a player attempts to swap the card held with one of the five highest cards in the pack (picture cards known as matador), the exchange is prevented and another action ensues, depending on the matador held by the opponent:

* Cuckoo: its holder says &quot;Cuckoo!&quot; or &quot;Stop! Cuckoo!&quot; and the round ends immediately.
* Dragoon: its holder says &quot;Chop!&quot; (&quot;hugg av&quot;), and the player who tried to swap cards must pay a counter to the pool. Play then proceeds with the player to the holder&#x27;s left.
* Cat: its holder says &quot;Miaow!&quot; or hisses like a cat and says &quot;Change back!&quot; (&quot;kiss, bytt om&quot;), the challenger pays a counter to the pool, and the game is reset so that every player has the card they started with.
* Horse or House: its holder says &quot;Pass the horse!&quot; (&quot;hest vorbi&quot;) or &quot;Pass the house!&quot; (&quot;hus vorbi&quot;), and the exchanger must now swap with the player to the left of the holder (or with the top card of the deck, if the holder is also the dealer).

When the round ends, all the players reveal their cards and the one with the lowest loses the round. If two tie, they both lose. If the lowest card was the Fool, then both its holder and the player with the next lowest card lose. A losing player pays one counter to the pool and is eliminated if they have no counters left. The last player remaining is the winner.

Instead of using counters, players may keep score using a chalk and slate. Players receive strokes (////) on the slate instead of paying counters to the pool and a player is eliminated on scoring an agreed number of strokes.

=== Hypp ===
Hypp packs were made in Norway until the 1980s and the game is known as early as 1859 in Denmark (as Hyp). They were the same as Gnav packs but consisted of only 1 set of the 21 distinct cards. One set of rules accompanying the cards switches the order of the Owl and the Fool. The cards were formerly single-ended, but the most recent packs by Saga Kunstforlag were double-ended.

Hypp is a game of chance in which cards are dealt in &#x27;heaps&#x27; (hence the name) and players bet on the cards at the bottom of each heap. It appears related to the French game of Petits Paquets, the game of Bankafalet described by Charles Cotton in 1674 and the old Czech game of Hromadky which is known as far back as 1609.

=== Slabberjan ===
Similar to Gnav but with a different ranking (highest to lowest): Cavalier (&quot;Kap-af&quot;) &gt; Bird (&quot;Vogel&quot;) &gt; Cat (&quot;Poesje&quot;) &gt; Tavern (&quot;Herberge&quot;) &gt; Numerals 12 to 1 &gt; 0 (zero) &gt; Blank (&quot;Blind&quot;, a blank card) &gt; Pot (&quot;Pot&quot;) &gt; Mask (&quot;Smoel&quot;) &gt; Fool (&quot;Nar&quot;).

=== Kille ===

The deck comprises 42 cards of a single suit, comprising two copies of 21 distinct cards, in the ranking (highest to lowest):

=== Cuccù ===

The modern deck comprises 40 cards, comprising two copies of 20 distinct cards, in the ranking (highest to lowest):

In modern Italy, the game is played with original rules only in the small Abruzzi towns of Campli and Montorio al Vomano, both in the Teramo province. The same cards are also used in Brescia and Bergamo provinces but for a completely different, trick-taking game.

=== Vogelspiel or Hexenspiel ===

The pack comprises 32 cards with 10 pairs of non-identical picture cards but only one set of 12 numeral cards. They rank from highest to lowest as follows:

<doc id="1215288" wikidata="Q1777153" url="?curid=1215288" title="Gimme Some Lovin'">
<text>&quot;Gimme Some Lovin&quot; is a song first recorded by the Spencer Davis Group. Released as a single in 1966, it reached the Top 10 of the record charts in several countries. Later, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the song on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs.

Other artists have also recorded versions of the song; group singer Steve Winwood later recorded it live with Traffic and a rendition by the Blues Brothers reached number 18 on the main US singles chart.

==Background==
As recalled by bassist Muff Winwood, the song was conceived, arranged, and rehearsed in just half an hour. At the time, the group was under pressure to come up with another hit, following the relatively poor showing of their previous single, &quot;When I Come Home&quot;, written by Jamaican-born musician Jackie Edwards, who had also penned their earlier number one hits, &quot;Keep On Running&quot; and &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot;. The band auditioned and rejected other songs Edwards offered them, and they let the matter slide until, with a recording session looming, manager Chris Blackwell took them to London, put them in a rehearsal room at the Marquee Club, and ordered them to come up with a new song:
==Personnel==
The Spencer Davis Group:
* Steve Winwood – lead vocals, organ, piano, percussion
* Spencer Davis – rhythm guitar, vocals
* Muff Winwood – bass, vocals
* Pete York – drums

==Chart performance==
==Lawsuit==
In 2016, Willia Dean Parker and Rose Banks sued Mervyn Winwood, Steve Winwood, and Kobalt Music Publishing for copyright infringement, alleging that they plagiarized their 1965 song &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Lot of Love&quot;. In 2019, it was ruled that the Spencer Davis Group did not plagiarize.
==Legacy==
In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; at number 247 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Winwood later recorded live versions of the song with Traffic for &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Last Great Traffic Jam&quot; (2005). In an album review for &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot;, AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann wrote &#x27;the [set list] capper was a rearranged version of Steve Winwood&#x27;s old Spencer Davis Group hit &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;.&quot; &#x27;

&quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; has been recorded by several rock and other artists. Pop artist Olivia Newton-John covered it for her 1978 album, &quot;Totally Hot&quot;, which an album reviewer called &quot;as close to a drunken party as one will get on a Newton-John album&quot;. A performance for the musical comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980) &quot;featur[es] an arrangement notable for the horn section that replaces Steve Winwood&#x27;s rumbling organ work&quot;, according to critic Bret Adams. Released as single by Atlantic Records, it reached number 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 chart, number 22 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart, and number 20 on the Dutch Single Top 100. In 1990, British group Thunder recorded it for their debut album &quot;Backstreet Symphony&quot;. AllMusic writer Alex Henderson commented: &quot;Another high point of this CD is an inspired cover of the Spencer Davis Group&#x27;s &#x27;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;,&#x27; which Thunder changes from blue-eyed soul/rock to straight-up hard rock.&quot;

The song was heard at the beginning of Illumination&#x27;s &quot;Sing&quot;.

<text>Rear-Admiral John Bythesea (15 June 1827 – 18 May 1906) was an officer of the Royal Navy. He was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in 1854 during the Crimean War. However, in 1872 he ruined his career when he put his battleship aground at Pantellaria, resulting in his dismissal from his ship; he was never employed at sea again.

== Early life ==
John Bythesea was born on 15 June 1827 in Freshford, Somerset, the son of Rev. George Bythesea.

He entered the Royal Navy in 1841, and was promoted to lieutenant on 12 June 1849.

On 22 June 1850, he was posted to the 46-gun screw-frigate commanded by Captain Robert Spencer Robinson, Lisbon. He stayed with &quot;Arrogant&quot; when she was recommissioned at Portsmouth by Captain Stephen Greville Fremantle on 27 September 1852. Fremantle was succeeded by Captain Hastings Yelverton on 24 October 1853. She served in the Baltic Sea in 1854 in the Crimean War.

He became a member of the Bath and County Club in 1861.

==Action for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross==
On 9 August 1854 in the Baltic, Lieutenant Bythesea obtained permission to land on the island of Vårdö, Åland off Finland with a Swedish-speaking crewman Stoker William Johnstone, to intercept important despatches from the Czar which were being sent via Vårdö to Bomarsund. &quot;They lay in wait for three days until five Russians arrived on 12 August with the postbags. Johnstone ambushed the men, at Bythesea&#x27;s signal, attempting to throw a rope around the group whilst Bythesea provided cover with just one pistol. Two of the men dropped their bags and fled while the remaining three finally surrendered. Bythesea ordered the men back to their own boat and then forced them to row it back to &quot;Arrogant&quot;, with the mailbags.&quot;

Bythesea was personally presented with the Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria at the first VC investiture held at Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857.

==Career up to &quot;Lord Clyde&quot;==
On 12 March 1855, Lieutenant Bythesea was appointed captain of the paddle gun-vessel and served in the Flying Squadron in the Baltic. On 10 May 1856 he was promoted to commander, and on 20 May, Lieutenant John Bousquet Field replaced him as captain of &quot;Locust&quot;.

On 4 March 1858 he took over as captain of the 17-gun screw-sloop (also spelled &quot;Cruiser&quot;) from Charles Fellowes. At the time, &quot;Cruizer&quot; was serving in the Far East and saw action in the 2nd Anglo-Chinese War. &quot;Cruizer&quot; paid off at Portsmouth on 1 May 1861.

On 15 May 1861, he was promoted to captain. In 1862, he served on the Commission to examine Canadian defences.

On 30 March 1863 he commissioned the 12-gun screw-corvette at Woolwich. &quot;Archer&quot; served on the West Africa Station. Bythesea was invalided out, and replaced by Captain Francis Marten on 12 April 1864.

From 1 April 1866 until 1867, he was carried on the books of the flagship of the North American Squadron, HMS &quot;Duncan&quot;, for special service as Naval Attache in Washington, D.C.

From 6 May 1867 until 29 November 1870 he was captain of the screw-frigate . Bythesea commanded her for the entire commission. She served first in the Channel squadron, then the West Indies, then joining the flying squadron at Bahia on 4 August 1869.

==Loss of HMS &quot;Lord Clyde&quot;==
On 14 September 1871 he commissioned the battleship at Plymouth and took her out to the Mediterranean Fleet. In March 1872, &quot;Lord Clyde&quot;:
: &quot;was lying at Syracuse and received a wire from Malta to proceed at once to the help of a British steamer aground on the island of Pantellaria, on which service she got far worst aground herself. Anchors were laid out, coal jettisoned, guns, ammunition and stores hoisted over the side into small casters in the island hired on the spot, and everything possible done to lighten her, but she remained a fixture except to sway in the swell from the open sea, strain her back, and wrench off her sternpost, rudderpost and rudder. It took some time to summon help, as that was a full generation before the days of wireless telegraphy and Pantellaria had no cables; but an officer was dispatched by a passing steamer to Malta, where was lying as flagship and came at once to pull her crippled sister off the floor and get her to bed. This proved an extremely difficult job even when she was afloat again, as she yawed about so violently without a rudder when in tow, as to pull the sister in charge all over the place. It took three days to conduct erring footsteps a distance that could ordinarily be covered in less than one, and all the while she was leaking at a steady rate of 2 feet per hour. On arrival at Malta she had to be docked with great care on account of the badly damaged state of her bottom; and the yard reported that it would take six months to repair.&quot;

The court-martial in April 1872 severely reprimanded Bythesea and the Navigating Officer, who were dismissed from their ship and neither of them were ever employed at sea again. &quot;Lord Clyde&quot; was never commissioned again.

==Marriage and retirement==
Bythesea married firstly Helen Dunbar Brogden (née Milne) on 7 July 1866 at the British Legation in Brussels. His wife had formerly been married to the iron master James Brogden but in 1865 had been divorced for adultery. This marriage too ended in divorce in 1873, Bythesea also citing his wife&#x27;s adultery. He married secondly Fanny Belinda Prior in 1874, His turn for promotion to the rank of Rear-Admiral came on 5 August 1877 but, because he did not have the requisite six years&#x27; sea time as a Captain, he was placed on the Retired List with the rank of Rear-Admiral.

He served as consulting naval officer to the Indian Government from 1874, until the Indian Navy was restructured in 1880. He was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) and a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1878.

He died at South Kensington on 18 May 1906 and was buried at Bath Abbey Cemetery, Somerset.

==The medal==
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>&quot;I Hear a Symphony&quot; is a 1965 song recorded by the Supremes for the Motown label.

Written and produced by Motown&#x27;s main production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland, the song became their sixth number-one pop hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart in the United States for two weeks from November 14, 1965, through November 27, 1965. On the UK singles chart, the single peaked at number thirty-nine.

==History==

===Overview===
The Supremes enjoyed a run of hits through 1964 and 1965 under the guidance of writer/producers Holland–Dozier–Holland. In mid-1965, the producers came to realize they had fallen into a rut when the Supremes&#x27; &quot;Nothing but Heartaches&quot; failed to make it to the Top Ten, missing it by just one position and breaking the string of number-one Supremes hits initiated with &quot;Where Did Our Love Go.&quot; Motown chief Berry Gordy was displeased with the performance of &quot;Nothing but Heartaches,&quot; and circulated a memo around the Motown offices that read as follows:

Holland-Dozier-Holland therefore set about breaking their formula and trying something new. The result was &quot;I Hear a Symphony,&quot; a song with a more complex musical structure than previous Supremes releases. &quot;Symphony&quot; was released as a single in place of another Holland-Dozier-Holland Supremes song, &quot;Mother Dear&quot;, which had been recorded in the same style as their earlier hits.

In a 1968 interview, Diana Ross said that this was one of her favorite songs to perform, even though its key register posed some challenges.

&quot;Billboard&quot; called the song a &quot;blockbuster&quot; as well as a &quot;well-written rhythm ballad with pulsating beat and top vocal work.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;rhythmic, medium-paced romancer about a lucky gal who’s head-over-heels in love with the special guy of her dreams.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;The Supremes will hear a symphony of coin for &#x27;I Hear a Symphony.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;I Hear a Symphony&quot;, later issued on an album of the same name, became the Supremes&#x27; sixth number-one hit in the United States. After the number-five hit &quot;My World Is Empty Without You&quot; and the number-nine hit &quot;Love Is Like an Itching in My Heart,&quot; the Supremes began a run of four more number-one hits: &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love,&quot; &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On,&quot; &quot;Love Is Here and Now You&#x27;re Gone,&quot; and &quot;The Happening.&quot; The group performed the hit song on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; on November 3, 1965.

<doc id="1215304" wikidata="Q6012528" url="?curid=1215304" title="In the Midnight Hour">
<text>&quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; is a song originally performed by Wilson Pickett in 1965 and released on his 1965 album of the same name, also appearing on the 1966 album &quot;The Exciting Wilson Pickett&quot;. The song was composed by Pickett and Steve Cropper at the historic Lorraine Motel in Memphis, later (April 1968) the site of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Pickett&#x27;s first hit on Atlantic Records, it reached number one on the R&amp;B charts and peaked at number 21 on the pop charts.

==Composition and recording==
Wilson Pickett recorded &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; at Stax Studios, Memphis, May 12, 1965. The song&#x27;s co-writer Steve Cropper recalls: &quot;[Atlantic Records president] Jerry Wexler said he was going to bring down this great singer Wilson Pickett&quot; to record at Stax Studio where Cropper was a session guitarist&quot; and I didn’t know what groups he&#x27;d been in or whatever. But I used to work in [a] record shop, and I found some gospel songs that Wilson Pickett had sung on. On a couple [at] the end, he goes: &#x27;I&#x27;ll see my Jesus in the midnight hour! Oh, in the midnight hour. I&#x27;ll see my Jesus in the midnight hour.&#x27;&quot; and Cropper got the idea of using the phrase &quot;in the midnight hour&quot; as the basis for an R&amp;B song. More likely, Cropper was remembering The Falcons&#x27; 1962 song &quot;I Found a Love,&quot; on which Pickett sings lead and says &quot;And sometimes I call in the midnight hour!&quot; The only gospel record Pickett had appeared on before this was the Violinaires&#x27; &quot;Sign of the Judgement,&quot; which includes no such phrase.

Besides Cropper, the band on &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; featured Stax session regulars Al Jackson (drums) and Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn (bass). According to Cropper, &quot;Wexler was responsible for the track&#x27;s innovative &quot;delayed backbeat&quot;&quot;, as Cropper revamped his planned groove for &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; based on a dance step called the Jerk, which Wexler demonstrated in the studio. According to Cropper, &quot;this was the way the kids were dancing; they were putting the accent on two. Basically, we&#x27;d been one-beat-accenters with an afterbeat; it was like &#x27;boom dah,&#x27; but here was a thing that went &#x27;um-chaw,&#x27; just the reverse as far as the accent goes.&quot;

Pickett re-recorded the song for his 1987 album &quot;American Soul Man&quot;.

==Reception and recognition==
&quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; reached number one on the R&amp;B chart in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine dated August 7, 1965, and crossed over to the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 reaching number 21: however according to Stax owner Jim Stewart the domestic sales total of the single in its original release was a moderate 300,000 units. One of the reasons why the song failed to crack the top 20 was that the song&#x27;s title was too suggestive of sexuality in the after hours. However &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; by Wilson Pickett has become an iconic R&amp;B track, placing at number 134 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, Pickett&#x27;s first of two entries on the list (the other being &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; at number 434). It is also one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, Pickett&#x27;s only such entry. In 2017, the song was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 1999, &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot; recorded in 1965 on Atlantic Records by Pickett was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<text>&quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&quot; is an instrumental by Dick Dale and The Del-Tones. It is often regarded as the first surf rock instrumental and is credited for launching the surf music craze. First played in public in 1960 at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa Peninsula, Newport Beach, California, it reached number 4 on the Los Angeles station KFWB, and later peaked at number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The song was used as the theme tune to the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Home Truths&quot;, originally presented by John Peel.

<doc id="1215329" wikidata="Q4809285" url="?curid=1215329" title="Free Lutheran Bible College and Seminary">
<text>Free Lutheran Bible College and Seminary (FLBCS) is one institution of higher education consisting of two programs, the undergraduate Free Lutheran Bible College (FLBC) and the four-year pastoral training program Free Lutheran Seminary (FLS). FLBCS is accredited through the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA), and an associate member of the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE). FLBCS is located in Plymouth, Minnesota, near the national offices of the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations (AFLC).

==Bible College==
FLBC is an accredited undergraduate institution. It was established in 1966 by the AFLC as the Association Free Lutheran Bible School. AFLC church founders sought to establish education for young Christians in the Bible before college, in efforts to help believers to &quot;win, build and equip&quot;. That mission is now stated as &quot;establishing students in the eternal and inerrant Word of God for a life of faith in Jesus Christ and faithful service in His kingdom.&quot; Current enrollment is approximately 115 students. FLBC students have attended from outside of the United States including Canada, Latvia, Russia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ecuador, Tanzania, Norway, Haiti, Bolivia, Germany, Mexico, and Brazil. The Bible college is a member of the Northern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (NIAC).

===Deans of the bible college===
*Rev. John Strand (1966–1967)
*Rev. Richard Snipstead (1968–1974)

*Rev. Joel Rolf (2006–2018)
*Rev. Dr. Wade Mobley (interim) (2018–2019)
*Rev. Adam Osier (2019–present)

==Seminary==
The AFLC established a theological seminary committed to historic Lutheran theology that opened in September 1964. The Free Lutheran Seminary only admits men into the school. Students attend seminary classes for three years. The fourth year is an internship at one of the AFLC churches. Current enrollment hovers around 20 students.

As an institution of the AFLC, the seminary believes and teaches that:

* The Bible is the divinely inspired, revealed, inerrant, and authoritative Word of God and as such is trustworthy in all its parts and is the supreme and only rule of faith and practice.
* The Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed, the Unaltered Augsburg Confession, and Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism are faithful expositions of the truths of Scripture.
* The local congregation is the right form of the Kingdom of God on earth. It teaches there is no authority above itself except the Word of God and the Spirit of God.

===Deans of the seminary===
*Dr. Iver B. Olson (1965–1971)
*Rev. Amos O. Dyrud (1971–1981)
*Dr. Francis W. Monseth (1981–2013)

Soon after, FLBCS built the Student Life Center, containing a gymnasium, coffee shop, locker rooms, and classroom and office space.

<doc id="1215331" wikidata="Q2144524" url="?curid=1215331" title="René Auguste Constantin de Renneville">
<text>René Auguste Constantin de Renneville (October 9, 1650 – March 13, 1723), was a French writer.

He was born in Caen. Because of his Protestant principles, Renneville left France for the Netherlands in 1699. On his return three years later he was denounced as a spy and imprisoned in the Bastille, where he remained until 1713. During his imprisonment he wrote a series of poems on the margins of a copy of &quot;Auteurs déguisés&quot; (Paris, 1690), which he called &quot;Otia bastiliaca&quot;. These were rediscovered by James Tregaskis in 1906.

Renneville was freed through the intercession of Queen Anne, and made his way to England. There he wrote his &quot;Histoire de la Bastille&quot; published in 1715 (volume 1) and 1719 (volumes 1–4 with a new preface) in Amsterdam with Étienne Roger, a publisher who addressed the European market. The publication was dedicated to George I and appeared simultaneously in an abridged English and an illustrated German edition. A Dutch edition followed in 1717. At the time of his death in 1723 he was a major of artillery in the service of the elector of Hesse. His other important work is a &quot;Recueil des voyages qui ont servi a l&#x27;établissement de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales aux Provinces Unies&quot; (10 vols, new ed., Rouen, 1725).

The English version of &quot;L&#x27;inquisition Françoise&quot; is of greater interest as it was published with William Taylor, the publisher Daniel Defoe chose for his &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; in 1719. Both titles eventually shared aspects of realism and romanticization, an interest in the hardly credible &quot;romantic&quot; story of a survivor.

<text>The Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) is one of the major centres of advanced study of nuclear physics in Russia. It is located in the Siberian town Akademgorodok, on Academician Lavrentiev Avenue. The institute was founded by Gersh Budker in 1959. Following his death in 1977, the institute was renamed in honour of Budker.

Despite its name, the centre was not involved either with military atomic science or nuclear reactors instead, its concentration was on high-energy physics (particularly plasma physics) and particle physics. In 1961 the institute began building VEP-1, the first particle accelerator in the Soviet Union which collided two beams of particles, just a few months after the ADA collider became operational at the Frascati National Laboratories in Italy in February 1961. The BINP employs over 3000 people, and hosts research groups and facilities.
==Active facilities==
*VEPP-4 – e+e− collider for the energy range 2Ebeam up to 12 GeV
**KEDR – detector for particle physics at VEPP-4
**ROKK-1 – facility for experiments with high energy polarized gamma-ray beams at VEPP-4
*VEPP-2000 – e+e− collider for the energy range 2Ebeam=0.4-2.0 GeV
**SND - Spherical Neutral Detector for particle physics experiments at VEPP-2000
**CMD-3 – Creogenic Magnetic Detector for particle physics experiments at VEPP-2000
*Electron cooling experiments

<doc id="1215338" wikidata="Q214430" url="?curid=1215338" title="Like a Rolling Stone">
<text>&quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; is a song by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on July 20, 1965, by Columbia Records. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; as its opening track.

During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in time. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a rock music format, and rookie session musician Al Kooper improvised the Hammond B2 organ riff which contributed to the track&#x27;s signature sound. Columbia Records was unhappy with both the song&#x27;s length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when, a month later, a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; reached No. 2 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (No. 1 in &quot;Cashbox&quot;) and became a worldwide hit.

Critics have described &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; as revolutionary in its combination of musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan&#x27;s voice, and the directness of the question &quot;How does it feel?&quot; It completed the transformation of Dylan&#x27;s image from folk singer to rock star, and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed it at No. 1 on their 2004 and 2010 &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; lists. It has been covered by many artists, from the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the Rolling Stones to the Wailers, Cat Power, Titus Andronicus and Green Day. At an auction in 2014, Dylan&#x27;s handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $2 million, a world record for a popular music manuscript.

==Writing==
In early 1965, after returning from the tour of England documented in the film &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;, Dylan was unhappy with the public&#x27;s expectations of him and the direction his career was taking, and considered quitting the music business. He said in a 1966 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview: Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation ... But &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27; changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It&#x27;s very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don&#x27;t dig you.

The song grew out of an extended piece of verse. In 1966, Dylan described its genesis to journalist Jules Siegel:

During 1965, Dylan composed prose, poems, and songs by typing incessantly. Footage in &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; of Dylan in his suite at London&#x27;s Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; began as a long piece of &quot;vomit&quot; (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC Radio in Montreal, Dylan called the creation of the song a &quot;breakthrough&quot;, explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27; and made it as a single. And I&#x27;d never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that was what I should do ... After writing that I wasn&#x27;t interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, I want to write songs.

From the extended version on paper, Dylan crafted four verses and the chorus in Woodstock, New York. In 2014, when the handwritten lyrics were put up for auction, the four-page manuscript revealed that the full refrain of the chorus does not appear until the fourth page. A rejected third line, &quot;like a dog without a bone&quot; gives way to &quot;now you&#x27;re unknown&quot;. Earlier, Dylan had considered working the name Al Capone into the rhyme scheme, and he attempted to construct a rhyme scheme for &quot;how does it feel?&quot;, penciling in &quot;it feels real&quot;, &quot;does it feel real&quot;, &quot;shut up and deal&quot;, &quot;get down and kneel&quot; and &quot;raw deal&quot;. The song was written on an upright piano in the key of D flat and was changed to C on the guitar in the recording studio.

== Recording ==
Dylan invited Chicago blues guitarist Mike Bloomfield to his Woodstock home for the weekend to learn new material. Bloomfield recalled, &quot;The first thing I heard was &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27;. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that&#x27;s what I do. He said, &#x27;Hey, man, I don&#x27;t want any of that B.B. King stuff&#x27;. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. I played the way that he dug, and he said it was groovy.&quot;

The recording sessions were produced by Tom Wilson on June 15–16, 1965, in Studio A of Columbia Records, 799 Seventh Avenue, in New York City. This would be the last song Wilson would produce for Dylan. In addition to Bloomfield, the musicians enlisted were Paul Griffin on piano, Joe Macho, Jr. on bass, Bobby Gregg on drums, and Bruce Langhorne on tambourine, all booked by Wilson. Gregg, Griffin, and Langhorne had previously worked with Dylan and Wilson on &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;.
In the first session, on June 15, five takes of the song were recorded in a markedly different style ( waltz time, with Dylan on piano) from the eventual release. The lack of sheet music meant the song had to be played by ear. However, its essence was discovered in the course of the chaotic session. The musicians did not reach the first chorus until the fourth take, but after the following harmonica fill Dylan interrupted, saying, &quot;My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?&quot; The session ended shortly afterward. The take was released on the 1991 compilation &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;.

When the musicians reconvened the following day, June 16, Al Kooper joined the proceedings. Kooper, at that time a 21-year-old session guitarist, was not originally supposed to play but was present in the studio as Wilson&#x27;s guest. When Wilson stepped out, Kooper sat down with his guitar with the other musicians, hoping to take part in the recording session. By the time Wilson returned, Kooper, who had been intimidated by Bloomfield&#x27;s guitar playing, was back in the control room. After a couple of rehearsal takes, Wilson moved Griffin from Hammond organ to piano. Kooper approached Wilson and told him he had a good part for the organ. Wilson belittled Kooper&#x27;s organ skills, but did not forbid him to play. As Kooper later put it, &quot;He just sort of scoffed at me ... He didn&#x27;t say &#x27;no&#x27;—so I went out there.&quot; Wilson was surprised to see Kooper at the organ but allowed him to play on the track. When Dylan heard a playback of the song, he insisted that the organ be turned up in the mix, despite Wilson&#x27;s protestations that Kooper was &quot;not an organ player&quot;.

There were 15 recorded takes on June 16. By now the song had evolved into its familiar form, in time with Dylan on electric guitar. After the fourth take—the master take that was released as a single—Wilson happily commented, &quot;That sounds good to me.&quot; Despite this, Dylan and the band recorded the song 11 more times.

The complete recording sessions that produced &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, including all 20 takes and the individual &quot;stems&quot; that comprise the four-track master, were released in November 2015 on the 6-disc and 18-disc versions of &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966&quot;.

==Themes==
Unlike conventional chart hits of the time, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; featured lyrics that were interpreted as expressions of resentment rather than love. Author Oliver Trager characterizes the lyrics as &quot;Dylan&#x27;s sneer at a woman who has fallen from grace and is reduced to fending for herself in a hostile, unfamiliar world&quot;. The song&#x27;s subject, &quot;Miss Lonely&quot;, previously opted for easy options in life—she attended the finest schools and enjoyed high-placed friends—but now that her situation has become difficult, it appears that she has no meaningful experiences to define her character. The opening lines of the song establish the character&#x27;s former condition:

And the first verse ends with lines that seemingly deride her current condition:

Despite the obvious vitriol, the song&#x27;s narrator also seems to show compassion for Miss Lonely, and expresses joy for her in the freedom in losing everything. Jann Wenner commented: &quot;Everything has been stripped away. You&#x27;re on your own, you&#x27;re free now ... You&#x27;re so helpless and now you&#x27;ve got nothing left. And you&#x27;re invisible—you&#x27;ve got no secrets—that&#x27;s so liberating. You&#x27;ve nothing to fear anymore.&quot; The final verse ends with the lines:

The refrain seems to emphasize these themes:

Dylan biographer Robert Shelton gave this interpretation: A song that seems to hail the dropout life for those who can take it segues into compassion for those who have dropped out of bourgeois surroundings. &#x27;Rolling Stone&#x27; is about the loss of innocence and the harshness of experience. Myths, props, and old beliefs fall away to reveal a very taxing reality.

Dylan humorously commented on the song&#x27;s moral perspective at a press conference at KQED television studio on December 3, 1965. When a reporter, suggesting that the song adopted a harsh perspective on a girl, asked Dylan, &quot;Are you hard on [people in your songs] because you want to torment them? Or to change their lives and make them know themselves?&quot;, Dylan replied while laughing, &quot;I want to needle them.&quot;

Commentators attempted to tie the characters in the song to specific people in Dylan&#x27;s personal life in 1965. In his book &quot;&quot;, Andy Warhol recalled that some people in his circle believed that &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; contained hostile references to him; he was told, &quot;Listen to &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27;—I think you&#x27;re the diplomat on the chrome horse, man.&quot; The reason behind Dylan&#x27;s alleged hostility to Warhol was supposedly Warhol&#x27;s treatment of actress and model Edie Sedgwick. It has been suggested that Sedgwick is the basis of the Miss Lonely character. Sedgwick was briefly involved with Dylan in late 1965 and early 1966, around which time there was some discussion of the two making a movie together. According to Warhol&#x27;s collaborator Paul Morrissey, Sedgwick may have been in love with Dylan, and was shocked when she found out that Dylan had secretly married Sara Lownds in November 1965. However, in &quot;The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia&quot;, Michael Gray argues that Sedgwick had no connection with &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, but states &quot;there&#x27;s no doubt that the ghost of Edie Sedgwick hangs around &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;&quot;.

Greil Marcus alluded to a suggestion by art historian Thomas E. Crow that Dylan had written the song as a comment on Warhol&#x27;s scene:
I heard a lecture by Thomas Crow ... about &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; being about Edie Sedgwick within Andy Warhol&#x27;s circle, as something that Dylan saw from the outside, not being personally involved with either of them, but as something he saw and was scared by and saw disaster looming and wrote a song as a warning, and it was compelling.

Joan Baez, Marianne Faithfull and Bob Neuwirth have also been suggested as possible targets of Dylan&#x27;s scorn. Dylan biographer Howard Sounes warned against reducing the song to the biography of one person, and suggested &quot;it is more likely that the song was aimed generally at those [Dylan] perceived as being &#x27;phony. Sounes adds, &quot;There is some irony in the fact that one of the most famous songs of the folk-rock era—an era associated primarily with ideals of peace and harmony—is one of vengeance.&quot;

Mike Marqusee has written at length on the conflicts in Dylan&#x27;s life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He suggests that the song is probably self-referential: &quot;The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he&#x27;s the one &#x27;with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that &quot;when I used words like &#x27;he&#x27; and &#x27;it&#x27; and &#x27;they,&#x27; and talking about other people, I was really talking about nobody but me.&quot;

The song is also notable for the amazing characters who surround the heroine. Andy Gill recalls the strangeness contained in the lyrics: &quot;Who, fascinated fans debated, was Miss Lonely, Napoleon in rags and—most bizarre of all—the diplomat who rode a chrome horse while balancing a Siamese cat upon his shoulder? What on earth was going on here?&quot; The diplomat in question, in the third verse:

One interpretation was formulated in Jean-Michel Buizard&#x27;s 2021 essay, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone Revisited: Une relecture de Dylan&quot; [French:&quot;A Re-reading of Dylan&quot;], which sheds new light on the possible identity of Miss Lonely and company. The central idea is that in 1965, the young Dylan remained secretly haunted by the country blues, which formed the framework of his first album (&quot;Bob Dylan&quot;, 1962) and of which he would say in 2004 in his &quot;&quot;: &quot;it was a counterpart of myself&quot;. The song is then conceived as a half-historical half-imaginary tale in which the old blues, once sovereign in the Southern countryside, surrounded by its servants, the bluesmen, finds itself alone and abandoned in the 1940s, when these same bluesmen, following the great wave of migration of the black population, left for the cities of the North and founded there a modern blues, electrified and emptied of its roots. Miss Lonely is thus &quot;an allegory of country blues&quot;.

Muddy Waters, author in 1950 of a well-known blues entitled &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, is emblematic of this great history of the blues. He is the one we find as a &quot;diplomat&quot; shouldering his guitar (the &quot;Siamese cat&quot;) on the train (the &quot;chrome horse&quot;) that took him to Chicago in 1943, where he transformed the blues of his childhood into the city blues that made him famous (&quot;he took from you everything he could steal&quot;). Other legendary bluesmen appear in the song: presumably Blind Lemon Jefferson as &quot;the mystery tramp&quot; in the second verse and Robert Johnson, &quot;Napoleon in rags&quot;, in the final one.

==Release==
According to Shaun Considine, release coordinator for Columbia Records in 1965, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was first relegated to the &quot;graveyard of canceled releases&quot; because of concerns from the sales and marketing departments over its unprecedented six-minute length and &quot;raucous&quot; rock sound. In the days following the rejection, Considine took a discarded acetate of the song to the New York club Arthur—a newly opened disco popular with celebrities and the media—and asked a DJ to play it. At the crowd&#x27;s insistence, the demo was played repeatedly, until finally it wore out. The next morning, a disc jockey and a programming director from the city&#x27;s leading top 40 stations called Columbia and demanded copies. Shortly afterward, on July 20, 1965, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was released as a single with &quot;Gates of Eden&quot; as its B-side.

Despite its length, the song is Dylan&#x27;s most commercially successful release, remaining in the US charts for 12 weeks, where it reached number 2. The song that held it from the top spot was the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot; The promotional copies released to disc jockeys on July 15 had the first two verses and two refrains on one side of the disk, and the remainder of the song on the other. DJs wishing to play the entire song would simply flip the vinyl over. While many radio stations were reluctant to play &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in its entirety, public demand eventually forced them to air it in full. This helped the single reach its number 2 peak, several weeks after its release. It was a Top 10 hit in other countries, including Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the UK.

In its contemporary review, &quot;Cash Box&quot; described &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;funky, rhythmic ode which proclaims the artist&#x27;s philosophy of rugged individualism&quot;.

==Music video==
In November 2013, forty-eight years after the release of the song, Dylan&#x27;s website released an official music video for &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Created by the digital agency Interlude, the video is interactive, allowing viewers to use their keyboards to flip through 16 channels that imitate TV formats, including game shows, shopping networks and reality series. People on each channel appear to lip-sync the song&#x27;s lyrics. Video director Vania Heymann stated, &quot;I&#x27;m using the medium of television to look back right at us – you&#x27;re flipping yourself to death with switching channels [in real life].&quot; The video contains an hour and 15 minutes&#x27; worth of content in all and features appearances from comedians Marc Maron, Carly Aquilino, Jessimae Peluso, and Nicole Byer, rapper Danny Brown, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; host Drew Carey, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor Steve Levy, TV personality Nessa, Jonathan and Drew Scott of &quot;Property Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; cast members Rick Harrison and Austin &quot;Chumlee&quot; Russell. The video was released to publicize the release of a 35-album box set, &quot;Bob Dylan: The Complete Album Collection Vol. One&quot;, containing Dylan&#x27;s 35 official studio albums and 11 live albums. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; recorded it as the longest wait for an official music video.

==Live performances==
Dylan performed the song live for the first time within days of its release, when he appeared at the Newport Folk Festival on July 25, 1965, in Newport, Rhode Island. Many of the audience&#x27;s folk enthusiasts objected to Dylan&#x27;s use of electric guitars, looking down on rock &#x27;n roll, as Bloomfield put it, as popular amongst &quot;greasers, heads, dancers, people who got drunk and boogied&quot;. According to Dylan&#x27;s friend, music critic Paul Nelson, &quot;The audience [was] booing and yelling &#x27;Get rid of the electric guitar, while Dylan and his backing musicians gave an uncertain rendition of their new single. Al Kooper, who offers a different version of the crowd&#x27;s reaction, claims that it was due to the length of the set they had just played, being only 15 minutes while other artists had done 45-minute sets.

&quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; was issued at the end of August 1965. When Dylan went on tour that fall he asked the future members of The Band to accompany him in performing the electric half of the concerts. &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; took the closing slot on his setlist and held it, with rare exceptions, through the end of his 1966 &quot;world tour&quot;. On May 17, 1966, during the last leg of the tour, Dylan and his band performed at Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England. Just before they started to play the track, an audience member yelled &quot;Judas!&quot;, apparently referring to Dylan&#x27;s supposed &quot;betrayal&quot; of folk music. Dylan responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe you... You&#x27;re a liar!&quot; With that, he turned to the band, ordering them to &quot;play it fucking loud!&quot;

Since then, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; has remained a staple in Dylan&#x27;s concerts, often with revised arrangements. It was included in his 1969 Isle of Wight show and in both his reunion tour with The Band in 1974 and the Rolling Thunder Revue tour in 1975–76. The song continued to be featured in other tours throughout the 1970s and 1980s. According to Dylan&#x27;s official website, he performed the song live over 2,000 times, as of 2019.

Live performances of the song are included on &quot;Self Portrait&quot; (recorded at the Isle of Wight, August 31, 1969), &quot;Before the Flood&quot; (recorded February 13, 1974), &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot; (recorded March 1, 1978), &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (recorded November 18, 1994), &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot; (recorded in Manchester, UK, May 17, 1966; same recording also available on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot;), The Band&#x27;s 2001 reissue of &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; (recorded January 1, 1972), and &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979–1981&quot; (Deluxe Edition) (recorded June 27, 1981). In 2016, all Dylan&#x27;s recorded live performances of the song from 1966 were released in the boxed set &quot;The 1966 Live Recordings&quot;, with the May 26, 1966 Royal Albert Hall performance released separately on the album &quot;The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert&quot;.

The July 1965 Newport performance of the song is included in Murray Lerner&#x27;s film &quot;The Other Side of the Mirror&quot;, while a May 21, 1966, performance in Newcastle, England is featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s documentary &quot;No Direction Home,&quot; along with footage of the above-mentioned May 17 heckling incident.

During the 1988 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Dylan performed &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; with Mick Jagger and approximately 30 other people. In 1998 Dylan performed the song with the Stones, who he was the opening act for, with Jagger stating that &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was written by Dylan for them. This claim was repeated again by Jagger during a Rolling Stones concert in Las Vegas in 2024.

Besides appearing on &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, the song&#x27;s standard release can be found on the compilations &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Biograph&quot;, &quot;The Best of Bob Dylan&quot; (1997), &quot;The Essential Bob Dylan&quot;, &quot;The Best of Bob Dylan&quot; (2005), and &quot;Dylan&quot;. The mono version appears on &quot;The Original Mono Recordings&quot;. In addition, the early, incomplete studio recording in time appears on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 2&quot;.

==Legacy==
The song&#x27;s sound has been described as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan&#x27;s voice, at once young and jeeringly cynical. Critic Michael Gray described the track as &quot;a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness in the central chorus: &#x27;How does it feel. The song had an enormous impact on popular culture and rock music. Its success made Dylan a pop icon, as Paul Williams notes:

Paul Rothchild, producer of the Doors&#x27; first five albums, recalled the elation that an American musician had made a record that successfully challenged the primacy of the British Invasion groups. He said, What I realized when I was sitting there is that one of US—one of the so-called Village hipsters—was making music that could compete with THEM—the Beatles, and the Stones, and the Dave Clark Five—without sacrificing any of the integrity of folk music or the power of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.

The song had a huge impact on Bruce Springsteen, who was 15 years old when he first heard it. Springsteen described the moment during his speech inducting Dylan into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and also assessed the long-term significance of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;:

Dylan&#x27;s contemporaries in 1965 were both startled and challenged by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon&#x27;s house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, &quot;It seemed to go on and on forever. It was just beautiful ... He showed all of us that it was possible to go a little further.&quot; Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: &quot;When I heard &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27;, I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: &#x27;If this wins and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I don&#x27;t need to do anything else ...&#x27; But it didn&#x27;t do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have.&quot; Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. &quot;What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27;&quot;.

Although CBS tried to make the record more &quot;radio friendly&quot; by cutting it in half and spreading it over both sides of the vinyl, both Dylan and fans demanded that the full duration of the recording should be placed on one side and that radio stations play the song in its entirety. The success of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; was influential in changing the music business convention regarding the length of singles, whereby they were restricted to durations of less than three minutes. In the words of the magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which took its name from the song and the 1950s blues song &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, &quot;No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time.&quot; Richard Austin, of Sotheby&#x27;s auction house, said: &quot;Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less. By defying convention with six and a half minutes of dark, brooding poetry, Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music.&quot;

In 1966, Dylan told Ralph Gleason: &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s the best song I wrote.&quot; In 2004, speaking to Robert Hilburn, Dylan still felt that the song had a special place in his work: &quot;It&#x27;s like a ghost is writing a song like that, it gives you the song and it goes away. You don&#x27;t know what it means. Except that the ghost picked me to write the song.&quot;

More than 50 years since its release, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; remains highly regarded among commentators. James Gerard, writing for &quot;AllMusic,&quot; characterized the song as &quot;one of the most self-righteous and eloquent indictments ever committed to wax&quot;, and declared it significant for beginning a new phase in Dylan&#x27;s career as a songwriter and performer. In an analysis of Dylan&#x27;s vocal performance in &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; published in &quot;Far Out,&quot; Sam Kemp highlighted the ironic quality his delivery lent the song, while also praising the ambiguity of the lyrics.

&quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; generally ranks highly in polls of the greatest songs ever written, measured by reviewers and fellow songwriters. A 2002 ranking by &quot;Uncut&quot; and a 2005 poll in &quot;Mojo&quot; both rated it as Dylan&#x27;s number one song. As for his personal views on such polls, Dylan told Ed Bradley in a 2004 interview on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he never pays attention to them, because they change frequently. Dylan&#x27;s point was illustrated in the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of All Time poll&quot; by &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2000, which included two Dylan singles, but not &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Five years later, the magazine named it his number one song. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; picked &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; as the number two single of the past 25 years in 1989, and then in 2004 placed the song at number one on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; again placed &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; at the top of their list of &quot;500 Greatest Songs Of All Time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; then re-ranked it at number 4 in their 2021 &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list. In 2006, Pitchfork Media placed it at number 4 on its list of &quot;200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s&quot;. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;GQ&quot; ranked the song number one and number two, respectively, on their lists of the 50 greatest Bob Dylan songs.

On June 24, 2014, Sotheby&#x27;s sold Dylan&#x27;s original hand-written lyrics of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; at a New York auction devoted to rock memorabilia. The lyrics were sold for $2 million, a record price for a popular music manuscript.

==Accolades==
==Personnel==
According to the Dylan researcher Olof Björner, except where noted:

*Bob Dylan – vocals, guitar, harmonica
*Mike Bloomfield – guitar
*Bobby Gregg – drums
*Paul Griffin – piano
*Al Kooper – organ
*Bruce Langhorne – tambourine
*Joe Macho, Jr. – bass guitar

==Jimi Hendrix Experience versions==

During the earlier part of his career with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, guitarist Jimi Hendrix occasionally performed &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; in concert. Hendrix was an admirer of Bob Dylan, and especially liked &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;; &quot;It made me feel that I wasn&#x27;t the only one who&#x27;d ever felt so low&quot;, Hendrix explained.

A live recording from the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival is the best known version and was first released in 1970 on the split album with Otis Redding &quot;Historic Performances Recorded at the Monterey International Pop Festival&quot;. Music critic Greil Marcus described the atmosphere of the Hendrix recording as &quot;Huge chords ride over the beginning of each verse like rain clouds; the tune is taken very slowly, with Hendrix&#x27;s thick, street-talk drawl sounding nothing at all like Dylan&#x27;s Midwestern dust storm.&quot; The Experience&#x27;s performance has been re-released several times, including on &quot;Jimi Plays Monterey&quot; (1986) and &quot;Live at Monterey&quot; (2007) albums and associated DVDs.

<text>A residence hall network, or ResNet (also Resnet or ResNET, or other variations), is a local area network (LAN) or a metropolitan area network (MAN) provided by a university that serves the personal computers of students in their residence halls or dormitory buildings. &quot;ResNet&quot; may also refer to the department that administers such a network or the services provided via the network. A ResNet usually allows students to connect to a university&#x27;s intranet with (possibly limited) access to the public Internet. ResNet is essentially the ISP for students residing in campus-managed housing.

== Administration ==
The department, organization, or group responsible for maintenance of and support for the residential computer network is often also known as ResNet. This group may be an independent department in the central Information Technology division, the Housing department, or some other division or department. ResNet responsibilities may also lie not with a group dedicated to ResNet but may be one of many responsibilities such as those commonly held by help desks.

== Services ==
The functions of such a department vary greatly between campuses. Most, at least, provide assistance in connecting to the school&#x27;s network. 
Other services may include the removal of viruses, adware, spyware, greyware, and malware, as well as services ranging from operating system or software and hardware advice to data recovery.
ResNet is slowly evolving into a full-blown computer Help Desk on many campuses, and in some cases has merged into a single support group for staff, faculty, and students.

Some ResNet organizations have branched from computer only support to alternate devices such as smartphones, PDAs, and gaming devices.
== The ResNet organization ==
Conceived in 1992, ResNet is an international organization providing a forum for discussion, collaboration, and development for IT professionals in higher education. Students, faculty, staff, and vendors participate in ResNet both through the ResNet Listserv and by attending the annual Student Technology Conference. The ResNet organization is dedicated to the research and advancement of student technologies and services and their use in higher education. The organization oversees the annual Student Technology Conference (and a related Professional Development Seminar), hosted by a member school.

The ResNet organization has evolved from its simple roots during an informal discussion at Educom, into an internationally recognized professional organization engaging in dialogue, collaboration with vendors and other professional organizations, and professional development. Via its research entity, the ResNet Applied Research Group (RARG), ResNet has contributed to the international higher education community by conducting and publishing original research on networking technologies, music and entertainment, security, and technology support.

The annual Student Technology Conference is held on the campus of a selected host institution. Among the institutions that have hosted the symposium are Stanford University, which hosted the first ResNet Symposium in 1994, Wellesley College, Kent State University, Ferris State University, Princeton University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Student Technology Conference is the only conference of its kind which deals exclusively with student technologies within academic institutions. Content in recent conferences has focused on collaboration between these living and learning environments, institutional academic offerings, and the future directions of technology and services. Many aspects of such services are addressed through case studies, topic presentations, focus group dialog, birds of a feather discussions, vendor participation, etc.

For ResNet 2000, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, a Pre-Conference Tutorial Content (PTC) was created to offer attendees a seminar style format that offered greater depth on topics. The PCT has since evolved into the Professional Development Seminar (PDS). The PDS offers attendees sessions on management of technical staff, staff development, advanced Malware detection and removal, and IT leadership.

<text>East Tyrol, occasionally East Tirol (), is an exclave of the Austrian federal state of Tyrol, separated from North Tyrol by parts of Salzburg State and parts of Italian South Tyrol (&quot;Südtirol&quot;, ). It is coterminous with the administrative district (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) of Lienz.

== History ==
The area around the former Roman &quot;municipium&quot; of Aguntum was, from the 12th century, held by the Counts of Gorizia, who took their residence at Lienz and inherited the County of Tyrol in 1253. While Tyrol was lost to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1363, the Gorizian counts retained Lienz until the extinction of the line in 1500. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg finally incorporated it into Austrian Tyrol.

East Tyrol&#x27;s present-day situation arose from the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I and its subsequent dissolution. By the 1915 Treaty of London, the Kingdom of Italy, which had joined the victorious Triple Entente, was to obtain the Tyrolean lands south of the Brenner Pass, as claimed by the Italian irredentism movement. In November 1918, the Italian Army occupied all Tyrol with 20,000-22,000 soldiers. Thus, under the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the rump state of German Austria had to cede to Italy the southern part of the former crown land of the Princely County of Tyrol, i.e. the present-day provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol and parts of the Belluno province.

After Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria in 1938, East Tyrol became part of the Reichsgau Kärnten (Carinthia). It was returned to Tyrol in 1947. After World War II, East Tyrol became part of the British occupied zone of Austria.

In Austria, East Tyrol borders the federal states of Carinthia in the east and Salzburg in the north, while it also shares borders with the Italian provinces of South Tyrol (Alto Adige, northern part of the region Trentino-Alto Adige) in the west and Belluno (the region Veneto) in the south. It is separated from the Tyrolean district of Schwaz in North Tyrol by a long common border of South Tyrol with the Salzburg Pinzgau region.

== Attractions ==
The High Tauern National Park is in East Tyrol, along with several mountains including the Großglockner (Austria&#x27;s highest mountain, 3798 m), and Großvenediger.

<text>&quot;Little Wing&quot; is a song written by Jimi Hendrix and recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1967. It is a slow tempo rhythm and blues-inspired ballad featuring Hendrix&#x27;s vocal and guitar with recording studio effects accompanied by bass, drums, and glockenspiel. Lyrically, it is one of several of his songs that reference an idealized feminine or guardian angel-like figure. At about two and a half minutes in length, it is one of his most concise and melodically focused pieces.

The origins of &quot;Little Wing&quot; have been traced back to the 1966 recording of &quot;(My Girl) She&#x27;s a Fox&quot;, an R&amp;B song which features Hendrix playing Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar accompaniment. He developed the song while performing in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village prior to his involvement with producer Chas Chandler. After being inspired by events at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, Hendrix completed the song in October 1967, when it was recorded by the Experience during the sessions for their second album &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Little Wing&quot; was released with the &quot;Axis&quot; album in December 1967 in the UK and the following month in the US. As one of only two songs from the album to become part of the Experience&#x27;s concert repertoire, the Experience often performed it live and recordings were issued on early Hendrix posthumous albums &quot;Hendrix in the West&quot; in 1972 and &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Concerts&quot; in 1982. More recently, demo versions have been released as well as additional live renditions. &quot;Little Wing&quot; is one of Hendrix&#x27;s most popular songs and has become a standard, with interpretations recorded by musicians in a variety of styles. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine included &quot;Little Wing&quot; on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; at number 357. 

==Background==
Jimi Hendrix began his career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and performed and recorded with several popular R&amp;B artists, including the Isley Brothers, Don Covay, and Little Richard. He learned from other R&amp;B guitarists, including Curtis Mayfield, who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording. Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963. He described the experience: &quot;The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions. Curtis was a &quot;really&quot; good guitarist ... I learned a lot in that short time. He probably influenced me more than anyone I&#x27;d ever played with up to that time, that sweet sound of his, you know&quot;. In 1966, Hendrix recorded a song titled &quot;(My Girl) She&#x27;s a Fox&quot; with the Icemen, an R&amp;B duo. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as &quot;paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield, [that] is virtually a blueprint for &#x27;Little Wing&#x27;&quot;. Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to &quot;She&#x27;s a Fox&quot; (included on the 2010 &quot;West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology&quot;) &quot;perhaps the strongest of his pre-Experience career. Hendrix&#x27;s Curtis Mayfield-influenced guitar styling is the song&#x27;s strongest attribute&quot;.

According to Hendrix, &quot;Little Wing&quot; came from an idea he had originally developed while playing in Greenwich Village, when he was fronting his band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames in the summer of 1966. He later explained that he was further inspired during the Experience&#x27;s performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival:
==Recording and composition==

In October 1967, recording sessions for the second Experience album, &quot;&quot;, began at Olympic Studios in London. On October 25, after recording the strongly R&amp;B-oriented &quot;Wait Until Tomorrow&quot;, the Experience recorded an instrumental version of &quot;Little Wing&quot;. It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, &quot;Chas knew right away what was needed. He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again&quot;. After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a &quot;hollow&quot; tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as &quot;out-of-phase&quot;. However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized the use of the Univibe phase shifter effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). Next, Hendrix added a straight (&quot;dry, without any effects&quot;) glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. According to Kramer, &quot;Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio&quot; and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.

Regarding the song&#x27;s arrangement, Shapiro commented, &quot;Musically, &#x27;Little Wing&#x27; is structured to lay a gossamer touch across the whole song from the arresting opening statement and the haunting glockenspiel to the use of a Leslie speaker cabinet for the guitar&quot;. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Matthew Greenwald, it is based on a &quot;gentle, soulful chord progression [which] guides the melody and is an accurate mirror of the title and lyrics&quot;. The song has been notated in  with one bar in at a slow rock (70–72 beats per minute) tempo and is built on a chord progression without a bridge section:

After an instrumental introduction, there are two verses, followed by a guitar solo, which has been described as &quot;richly melodic&quot; by biographer Keith Shadwick. Shapiro noted the song&#x27;s brevity: &quot;The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, &#x27;Little Wing&#x27; was hardly any longer – he said what he wanted to say and stopped&quot;.

Hendrix&#x27;s use of guitar chords for the song involves unconventional finger positions and approach to the fretboard. Guitarist Frank Marino explained:

A reference work by Hal Leonard compares it to a pianist&#x27;s approach, with Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;thumb fret[ting] the bass notes, functioning in almost the same manner as a keyboardist&#x27;s left hand, and the fingers of his fretting hand can be likened to a pianist&#x27;s right hand&quot;. Leonard also adds that guitarist Adrian Belew describes the technique as a &quot;lost art&quot;.

The name &quot;Little Wing&quot; was first used by Hendrix as a working title for an entirely separate song, later re-titled &quot;Angel&quot; and released as a single posthumously.

==Lyrics and interpretation==
In discussing his lyrics, Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic. In a 1967 interview, he explained &quot;Most ballads come across in different ways. Sometimes you see things in different ways than other people see it. So then you write it in a song. It could represent anything&quot;. In different interviews, he acknowledged an American Indian-influence on his songs &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot;, &quot;May This Be Love&quot;, and &quot;Little Wing&quot;. He described &quot;Little Wing&quot; as being &quot;based on a very, very simple Indian style&quot;, perhaps referring to some Native American mythologies in which spirits inhabit nature and animals, including birds. In one interview, he saw it as self-explanatory: &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what it&#x27;s about, like &#x27;She&#x27;s walking through the clouds&#x27;&quot;,

Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray likens the figure to a feminine ideal: &quot;Sometimes she is a spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is&quot;. The figure first appears as &quot;Waterfall&quot; in &quot;May This Be Love&quot;, where she offers solace and hope, and as &quot;a soulful, loving sprite&quot; in &quot;Little Wing&quot;. However, other writers have suggested that the figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix&#x27;s later song &quot;Angel&quot;. Hendrix&#x27;s brother, Leon, interpreted &quot;Little Wing&quot; (and &quot;Angel&quot;) as a general tribute: &quot;He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife&quot;. Hendrix&#x27;s hand-written lyrics for &quot;Angel&quot; (with the note, &quot;Finished January 14, 1968&quot;) use the title &quot;My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)&quot;, which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed &quot;Little Wing&quot; in concert for the first time. At some point he responded to a question, &quot;Love? I know a girl, Katerina, in Sweden.&quot; In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: &quot;So like &#x27;Little Wing&#x27; is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes ... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it. And me with my crazy ass couldn&#x27;t get it together, so I&#x27;m off here and there and off over there.&quot;

==Releases==
&quot;Little Wing&quot;, along with the rest of the tracks for &quot;Axis: Bold as Love&quot;, was mixed October 31, 1967. Because some of the masters had been lost, stereo remixes were prepared on November 1 (it is not clear if &quot;Little Wing&quot; was among those remixed). On November 2, 1967, a monaural mix was prepared, making &quot;Axis&quot; the last Hendrix album specifically mixed in mono (subsequent mono albums were electronically &quot;folded&quot; from the stereo mixes). When recording engineer Kramer was preparing the album for a new mono reissue, he commented on the differences: &quot;Perhaps the most unique track was &#x27;Little Wing&#x27;. Jimi&#x27;s guitar and vocals were much drier while the drum reverb was much more present. It was experimentation ... the entire [mono] album was all mixed in one day!&quot;

The album was issued by Track Records in the UK on December 1, 1967, and Reprise Records on January 15, 1968, in the US. The song appears on subsequent reissues of &quot;Axis: Bold as Love&quot;, which continues to be a best selling Hendrix album. It has also been included on numerous Hendrix compilation albums, including &quot;The Essential Jimi Hendrix&quot;, &quot;Stone Free&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Experience&quot;, &quot;Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix&quot;, and &quot;Voodoo Child: The Jimi Hendrix Collection&quot;. In 2022, the British Phonographic Industry awarded &quot;Little Wing&quot; its Silver certification, signifying sales of over 200,000. However, it is unknown whether this applies to the original recording or a subsequent live version.

==Live performances==
&quot;Little Wing&quot; was one of only two songs from &quot;Axis&quot; that the Experience regularly performed in concert, the other being &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot;. Except for the glockenspiel and the song&#x27;s ending, their live performances generally follow the studio arrangement. Since the &quot;Axis&quot; recording ends on a fade, Hendrix needed to devise a different live ending. Early recordings show a progression to an open chord, while later ones have more elaborate single-string guitar improvisation with effects, such as wah-wah, before a chiming final chord. For one 1968 performance in San Francisco, Hendrix&#x27;s guitar signal was routed through a Leslie speaker. Writer Dave Rubin commented, &quot;the real Leslie played outdoors [out of the studio] like this really gives a very delicate, gentle swirl to the chords and helps the chordal embellishments in the intro&quot;. This version was also rendered at a slower (56 bpm) tempo, making it somewhat longer (4:01).

On January 8, 1968, the Experience debuted the song at the Konserthuset in Stockholm, Sweden, recordings of which have appeared on bootleg albums. Other live versions appear on &quot;Stages: Paris 68&quot; (L&#x27;Olympia Paris, January 29, 1968), &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Concerts&quot; (Winterland Ballroom San Francisco, October 12, 1968), 
and &quot;Hendrix in the West&quot; (Royal Albert Hall London, February 24, 1969). These recordings have been reissued on &quot;Live in Paris &amp; Ottawa 1968&quot;, &quot;Winterland&quot;, and &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Experience&quot; box set. The 1969 Royal Albert Hall live recording was included on singles issued in the UK and US in 1972. A March 17, 1968, instrumental jam with Hendrix and members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and the Electric Flag is built around &quot;Little Wing&quot;. Hendrix recorded it for his personal use around the time he began recording tracks for &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; at the Record Plant studio in New York. This low fidelity tape from the Cafe au Go Go, along with others from the Generation Club and the Scene in New York, was later stolen from his apartment and has appeared on several bootleg albums over the years.

==Notable covers and adaptations==
===Eric Clapton===
English guitarist and singer Eric Clapton has performed &quot;Little Wing&quot; throughout his career, beginning in 1970 with Derek and the Dominos. He explained in an interview:

Derek and the Dominos performed the song in London at the Marquee Club ten days after their live debut at the Lyceum on June 14, 1970. With Duane Allman on second guitar, the group recorded &quot;Little Wing&quot; at Criteria Studios in Miami, during the sessions for &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; shortly before Hendrix&#x27;s death on September 18, 1970. Clapton biographer Michael Schumacher notes, &quot;Clapton had intended it as a tribute to a living legend, but now that Hendrix was gone, the song hit on a different emotional level.&quot;

Atco Records issued the song on a single as the B-side to &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; and included it on &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;. Critics&#x27; comments on Derek and the Dominos&#x27; rendition range from &quot;exquisitely arranged&quot; (&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;) to &quot;bombastic&quot;(&quot;Legends of Rock Guitar&quot;). The group performed the song during their tour and a recording from the Fillmore East in New York City on October 23, 1970, was released on the &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot; album in 1994.

After the break up of Derek and the Dominos, Clapton continued to perform &quot;Little Wing&quot;. Live recordings appear on &quot;Eric Clapton&#x27;s Rainbow Concert&quot; (1973), &quot;Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies&quot; (1974, released 1996), &quot;Eric Clapton &amp; Friends in Concert&quot; (DVD with Sheryl Crow 1999), &quot;Live in San Diego&quot; (2007, released 2016), &quot;Live from Madison Square Garden&quot; (with Steve Winwood 2008, released 2009).
===Stevie Ray Vaughan===
Texas blues musician Stevie Ray Vaughan recorded an instrumental version in 1984, although it was not released until 1991, when it appeared on Vaughan&#x27;s posthumously released album &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;. Vaughan&#x27;s interpretation of the song won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.
==Recognition and legacy==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine has included &quot;Little Wing&quot; on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; at number 357 in 2004, number 366 when the list was updated in 2010, and 188 in 2021 and 2024. Several musicians have recorded the song in a variety of styles.

Gil Evans included a jazz arrangement in his band&#x27;s repertoire throughout his career. A version was later included on an expanded reissue of &quot;The Gil Evans Orchestra Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix&quot; (1974). In 1987, Evans provided an arrangement and backing for a recording by English musician Sting for his second solo album &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot;. Murray describes Evans&#x27; involvement as &quot;almost his last creative act&quot; (Evans died less than a year later).

Irish pop rock band The Corrs recorded the song for their 1997 album &quot;Talk on Corners&quot;. An AllMusic album review noted &quot;[t]he best and most spirited Celtic cut is &#x27;Little Wing,&#x27; deliciously resting on the contributions of the dropping-by Chieftains.&quot;

<text>Ron Field (October 18, 1933 – February 6, 1989) was an American choreographer, dancer, and director.
== Life and career ==
Field was born in New York City, New York where he made his Broadway debut as a child in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; (1941) with Gertrude Lawrence. He later danced in the ensembles of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1949), &quot;Kismet&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1955) before deciding to concentrate on choreography. His first two efforts &quot;Nowhere But Up&quot; (1962) and &quot;Cafe Crown&quot; (1964) were unsuccessful, but in 1966 he won his first Tony Award for his dazzling work in the hit &quot;Cabaret&quot;, the first of several noteworthy successes.

During rehearsals for Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s trouble-plagued &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; in 1981, Field was dismissed from the creative team.

It wasn&#x27;t until a revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; in 1987 that he would have another Broadway success.

In addition to his work on Broadway, Field staged such diverse projects as Las Vegas nightclub acts, the 44th Annual Academy Awards telecast in 1972, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (a 1976 TV special starring Sandy Duncan), a Hollywood Bowl concert and television special with Bette Midler in 1977, the opening ceremonies for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and an acclaimed revival of &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; in London&#x27;s West End. He also choreographed Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;New York, New York&quot; (1977).

On February 6, 1989, Field died in New York City at the age of fifty-five. Though obituaries at the time said his &quot;cause of death was brain lesions and neurological impairments,&quot; it was common at the time for survivors of public figures to euphemize AIDS or provide only the symptoms and not the overarching cause in obituaries due to rampant stigma. Sources since have confirmed Field did die of AIDS.

<text>&quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; is a 1972 song by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Neil Young. The lyrics describe the effects of heroin addiction on musicians Young knew, including his friend and Crazy Horse bandmate Danny Whitten, who would die of an overdose the same year the song was released. The money that Whitten used to buy the drugs was provided by Young. The song would preview the theme of Young&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night,&quot; which would reflect on the fatal heroin overdoses of Whitten and Bruce Berry, a roadie for Young and Crazy Horse.

== Background and lyrics ==
&quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; was first released on Young&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Harvest&quot;. Rather than re-recording it, Young selected a live version from January 1971 that featured him singing and playing acoustic guitar. It would appear on the compilation albums &quot;Decade&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in 2004. On the handwritten liner notes for &quot;Decade&quot;, Young wrote of the song: &quot;I am not a preacher, but drugs killed a lot of great men.&quot;

Young performed the song in a 2005 Nashville concert, with the version being included on Jonathan Demme&#x27;s 2006 documentary &quot;Neil Young: Heart of Gold&quot;. The documentary&#x27;s DVD includes Young&#x27;s 1971 performance of the song from &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;.

The song also appears on the 2007 album &quot;Live at Massey Hall 1971&quot;. On that album, Young presented &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; with the following introduction:
Ever since I left Canada about five years ago or so and moved down south, I found out a lot of things that I didn&#x27;t know when I left. Some of &#x27;em are good, and some of &#x27;em are bad. Got to see a lot of great musicians before they happened, before they became famous, y&#x27;know, when they were just gigging, five and six sets a night... things like that. And I got to see a lot of great musicians who nobody ever got to see for one reason or another. But, strangely enough, the real good ones that you never got to see was... &#x27;cause of heroin. And that started happening over and over. Then it happened to someone that everyone knew about. So I just wrote a little song.

Gold was mined in Kyūfun and Kinkaseki while coal was mined in &quot;Kau-tong&quot; (猴硐; &quot;Houtong&quot;).

After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Ruifang was organized as an urban township of Taipei County. The mining sites became popular tourist destinations after 1990. On 25 December 2010, Taipei County was upgraded into a municipality named New Taipei City and Ruifang became a district of the municipality. In March 2012, it was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Small Tourist Towns&quot; by the Tourism Bureau.

<doc id="1215367" wikidata="Q2215255" url="?curid=1215367" title="Not Fade Away (song)">
<text>&quot;Not Fade Away&quot; is a song credited to Buddy Holly (originally under his first and middle names, Charles Hardin) and Norman Petty (although Petty&#x27;s co-writing credit is likely to have been a formality) and first recorded by Holly and his band, the Crickets.

==Original song==
Holly and the Crickets recorded the song in Clovis, New Mexico, on May 27, 1957, the same day the song &quot;Everyday&quot; was recorded. The rhythmic pattern of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; is a variant of the Bo Diddley beat, with the second stress occurring on the second rather than third beat of the first measure, which was an update of the &quot;hambone&quot; rhythm, or patted juba from West Africa. Jerry Allison, the drummer for the Crickets, pounded out the beat on a cardboard box. Allison, Holly&#x27;s best friend, wrote some of the lyrics, though his name never appeared in the songwriting credits. Joe Mauldin played the double bass on this recording. It is likely that the backing vocalists were Holly, Allison, and Niki Sullivan, but this is not known for certain.

&quot;Not Fade Away&quot; was originally released as the B-side of the hit single &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; and was included on the album &quot;The &quot;Chirping&quot; Crickets&quot; (1957). The Crickets&#x27; recording never charted as a single. 

== Personnel ==
Buddy Holly and the Crickets
* Buddy Holly – lead vocals, lead guitar, backing vocals
* Jerry Allison – drums, card-box percussion
* Joe B. Mauldin – contrabass
* Niki Sullivan – rhythm guitar, backing vocals

==The Rolling Stones version==

In 1964, the Rolling Stones&#x27; cover of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; was a major hit in the United Kingdom. It was the A-side of the band&#x27;s first US single.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; version of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; was one of their first hits. Recorded in January 1964 and released by Decca Records on February 21, 1964, with &quot;Little by Little&quot; as the B-side, it was their first Top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, reaching number three. London Records released the song in the US on March 6, 1964, as the band&#x27;s first single there, with &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; as the B-side. The single reached number 48 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. It also reached number 44 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; pop singles chart in the U.S. and number 33 in Australia based on the Kent Music Report. &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; was not on the UK version of their debut album, &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;, but was the opening track of the US version, released a month later as &quot;England&#x27;s Newest Hitmakers&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a wild, freewheeling full-sounding pounder that can take off in no time flat.&quot; It was a mainstay of the band&#x27;s concerts in their early years, usually opening the shows. It was revived as the opening song in the band&#x27;s Voodoo Lounge Tour, in 1994 and 1995.

=== Personnel ===

According to authors Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, except where noted:

* Mick Jagger double tracked lead vocal, hand claps, tambourine, maracas
* Keith Richards twelve-string acoustic guitar, lead guitar
* Brian Jones harmonica
* Bill Wyman bass
* Charlie Watts drums

=== Charts ===
==Other cover versions==
*The song is closely associated with the Grateful Dead as one of their signature tunes—one which the band transformed from Holly&#x27;s 1950s boy/girl romanticism to one reflecting the 1960s’ more spiritual universal love. Their 1971 recording of the song is included on the eponymous second live album. The Dead first performed it on June 19, 1968 at the Carousel Ballroom, San Francisco, California, and subsequently performed it more than 600 more times before the group disbanded in 1995, following the death of lead guitarist Jerry Garcia. The surviving members (except Tom Constanten and Donna Jean Godchaux) reunited and played the song for the last time all together as Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead it was the last song of the second set (VC before the encores) on the last night of Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead Versions of the song are included on the Skull and Roses AKA &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; (1971) and &quot;Rare Cuts and Oddities 1966&quot; albums. The song continued to be played by later iterations of the band, including The Other Ones, The Dead, and most recently Dead &amp; Company.
*Rush recorded a version of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; as their debut single in 1973, which peaked at number 88 in Canada. The single was released on the band&#x27;s own Moon Records label, and is considered a rare collector&#x27;s item today, as it has never been reissued on any format.
*Tanya Tucker included a funky, rock-and-roll version of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; on her album, &quot;TNT&quot; (1978). Tucker&#x27;s cover of this song peaked at number 70 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in 1979.
*John Scofield included the song in his 2022 solo album.
*Florence and the Machine recorded a version of the song in 2010.
*Stevie Nicks contributed a cover of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; for the tribute album, &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly r&quot;eleased in September 2011.

<text>Wanli District (), known in Basay as Masu, is a rural district on the rocky seacoast in northeastern New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. Wanli is a popular tourist destination and the site of the Cape Yehliu Miocene Formation which features distinctive hoodoo outcrops. The &quot;Queen&#x27;s Head&quot; outcrop is a Taiwanese icon and serves as an informal trademark for the township. Kataw in the adjacent Jinshan District features the Wanli Taiwanese hot springs area, which is connected with the Jinshan Hot Springs (金山溫泉).

==History==
The village of Masu (瑪鋉) was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines before the era of European colonization. The area first came under the control of the Spanish, who were then ousted by the Dutch. The area began to develop when Hoklo people came to set up fishing operations.

The Ming dynasty loyalist Koxinga landed his troops at Wanli in 1661 to expel the Dutch from their northern strongholds while their principal fortress in Tainan was under siege.

In 1683, following the Qing dynasty conquest of Taiwan, the area was incorporated into Zhuluo County. In 1875, it was a member of Kimpauli (金包里堡), Kelung Sub-Subprefecture (基隆支廳).

In 1891, during Qing dynasty rule, the village was destroyed by military force as punishment for engaging in raids against Chinese camphor men and soldiers near Tokoham (modern-day Daxi).

When the Japanese took control of the island in 1895, Wanli (called &quot;Banri&quot; by the Japanese) became part of &quot;Kīrun&quot; Subprefecture, &quot;Taihoku Ken&quot;. In 1901, a reorganisation split &quot;Taihoku Ken&quot; up into smaller prefectures, with Banri becoming part of Kinpori (Kimpauli) Subprefecture, . In 1909, Kīrun Prefecture was amalgamated into the larger . This situation remained in place until the Republic of China took over administration of Taiwan at the end of World War II: Taihoku Prefecture became Taipei County, and Banri Village became Wanli Township.

==Geography==
Wanli is bordered to the northwest by Jinshan District, New Taipei, to the northeast by the Pacific Ocean, to the east by the Anle and Qidu Districts of Keelung. To the south is a short border with Xizhi District of New Taipei City, and to the southwest is Taipei City&#x27;s Shilin District. The topography of the area is marked by the rocky Pacific coastline and the forested, mountainous interior.

==Administration==
Since December 25, 2010, Wanli has been administered as a district of New Taipei City. Prior to this date, Wanli was a township under Taipei County. Wanli is further subdivided into ten villages: Wanli (), Beiji (), Guihou (), Yehliu (), Dapeng (), Huangtan (), Shuangxing (), Xidi (), Kanjiao (), and Zhongfu (). Prior to the 2010 reorganization, Wanli elected its own mayor, but now as a district of New Taipei City the District Chief is appointed by the mayor of New Taipei City.

==Economy==
The crabbing industry is important, and in 2012 the government established the Wanli Crab brand name to boost sales.

==Infrastructure==
* Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant

==Tourist attractions==

* Yehliu
* Yehliu Ocean World
* Feicui Bay (翡翠灣)
* Wanli UFO village, a large collection of prefabricated Futuro and Venturo homes

==Notable natives==
* Huang Yee-ling, singer
* Lai Ching-te, President of the Republic of China

<doc id="1215387" wikidata="Q5046223" url="?curid=1215387" title="Carrie Donovan">
<text>Carrie Donovan (March 22, 1928 – November 12, 2001) was an American fashion editor for &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. In the 1990s she became known for her work in Old Navy commercials where she wore her trademark large eyeglasses and black clothing, often declaring the merchandise &quot;Fabulous!&quot;. In almost all of the commercials, she appeared alongside Magic the dog and various other stars from TV and fashion. She was often mistaken for Natalie Schafer (Mrs. Howell from Gilligan&#x27;s Island) in the commercials because of the presence of multiple sitcom characters from the 1970s.

She was parodied by Ana Gasteyer on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

== Early life ==

Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born in Lake Placid, New York. Carrie and her sister, Jane, lived primarily with their grandparents until 1942 when they then went to live with their mother. Donovan did not have a relationship with her father who left early on in her life. When Donovan was just 10 years old, she mailed her own sketches for a design collection to the actress Jane Wyman, who replied with a handwritten letter. She later attended the Parsons School of Design, graduating in 1950. Donovan never learned how to sew, so she had bribed her classmates to sew her test pieces for school. She worked as a journalist for 30 years; she always wrote her copy out by hand, because she never learned how to use a typewriter.

== Career ==

Donovan&#x27;s first job was at Saks Fifth Avenue, where she worked under Tatiana Liberman, who was married to Alexander Liberman, the editor of &quot;Vogue&quot;. Donovan was recruited by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 1955 after she graduated from Parsons School of Design. A few years later Donovan was recruited by Diana Vreeland of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

Donovan gained recognition as a style editor for &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. Donovan later joined &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and was senior editor from 1972 to 1977 before she went back to &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. She was known for being able to quickly recognize talent, being among the first to praise the work of designers Donna Karan and Perry Ellis. It was her work for Old Navy, however, that brought her into the public eye.

<doc id="1215398" wikidata="Q36006" url="?curid=1215398" title="Jocky Wilson">
<text>John Thomas &quot;Jocky&quot; Wilson (22 March 1950 – 24 March 2012) was a Scottish professional darts player. After turning professional in 1979, he quickly rose to the top of the game, winning the World Professional Darts Championship in 1982, then again in 1989. Wilson competed in all major darts tournaments of the era and won the British Professional Championship a record four times between 1981 and 1988.

A contemporary and rival of Eric Bristow, Bob Anderson and John Lowe, Wilson&#x27;s ungainly appearance and rough-hewn lifestyle belied his prowess in the sport. He was dogged by health problems, however, and suddenly retired from the game in December 1995. He withdrew from public life and was rarely seen in public or gave interviews before his death in March 2012.

In 2022 the new World Seniors Darts Championships was launched with the trophy engraved with the names of four deceased former World Champions on the darts: Wilson, Bristow, Leighton Rees and Andy Fordham.

== Early life ==
As a child, Wilson&#x27;s parents were deemed unfit to raise him and Wilson spent much of his childhood in an orphanage. 

Wilson served in the British Army from 1966 to 1968. He also worked as a coalman, a fish processor, and a miner at Kirkcaldy&#x27;s Seafield Colliery. In 1979, during a period of unemployment, he entered a darts competition at Butlins, Ayrshire, which he went on to win, claiming the top prize of £500,(worth around £2,300 in 2024). After his success in this tournament, he turned professional.

== Career ==

=== Peak ===
In 1981, Wilson beat world number one Eric Bristow and Cliff Lazarenko of England in the BDO Nations Cup final. His Scotland teammates in the 5–4 win were captain Rab Smith and Angus Ross.

His greatest achievements came in the World Championships, first in 1982 where he beat Lowe 5–3 in the final, and then seven years later, when he beat his other great rival Bristow 6–4 in a classic match, where Bristow had recovered from 5–0 down to 5–4 and 2–2 in the tenth set. This was to be the Scot&#x27;s last taste of success in a major event although the odd final appearance still came over the next few years.

His record at the World Championship was one of great consistency. From his debut in 1979 until 1991 he managed to reach at least the quarter-finals on every single occasion. He was quarter-finalist eight times (1979, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991) and three-times a losing semi-finalist (1983, 1984, 1987) in addition to his two World titles. In 1992 and 1993 he suffered first round defeats for the only time at the Lakeside Country Club.

He made several guest appearances on television including the popular darts themed quiz show &quot;Bullseye&quot; hosted by Jim Bowen, and produced by Central Television.

 In the television documentary, &quot;Eric Bristow: Sports Life Stories&quot;, Bristow described various psychological ploys he used against his opponents to &quot;scramble their heads&quot;. He added that in response the only two opponents who would look him in the eye at the handshake at the start of a game were Wilson and Lowe, saying that like himself they had &quot;no fear&quot;. He also referred to Wilson&#x27;s unorthodox style such as a tendency to jerk his shoulder on throwing the third dart. Bristow commented that it seemed to have no detrimental effect on the accuracy, describing Wilson as &quot;a one off&quot;. Bristow stated though that Wilson&#x27;s sporting demise was due to the increasing volumes of alcoholic spirits Wilson would consume remarking, &#x27;At the end he was doing a 40 oz bottle&#x27;.

=== Darts split ===
Wilson joined the other top professionals who split away from the ruling British Darts Organisation in 1993 to form the WDC (now Professional Darts Corporation). He was not able to recapture the form that took him to two world championships however, and only participated in two PDC World Championships, failing to win a single match. He lost both group games in 1994 (to Dennis Priestley and Graeme Stoddart) and again in 1995 (to Priestley and Lowe). 
One of the highlights of Wilson&#x27;s three years in the WDC was him reaching the final of the 1993 WDC Skol UK Matchplay in March 1993, which was broadcast on ITV and played on quadro dartboards. Wilson became one of the few players to have hit 240 on television during a visit to the dart board, by getting 3 darts in the quadruple 20, during his semi final victory over John Lowe. Wilson lost the final to Dennis Priestley.

Wilson reached the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Matchplay, losing to eventual champion Larry Butler. Wilson&#x27;s final appearance in a televised tournament came in the 1995 World Matchplay. He beat Rod Harrington 8–4 in the first round, but in his final televised major, lost to Nigel Justice in the second round.

== Post-retirement ==
Although Wilson never formally announced his retirement, he stopped competing professionally on 23 December 1995, after being diagnosed with diabetes, which stopped him from drinking during games.

For ten years during his darts career, Wilson had a house in Wallsend to cut down on travel expenses, but he left that to return to his native Kirkcaldy. He was declared bankrupt in 1998, and then survived on disability allowance, living as a recluse in a one-bedroom flat back on the council estate where he grew up. He also suffered from arthritis in his hands.

Wilson ceased giving interviews to the press and television. An &quot;Observer&quot; reporter tried to interview him in January 2007 on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first title win, only to be told by his wife, &quot;He never has (given an interview) since stopping and never will. He thinks it&#x27;s all in the past, it&#x27;s over with.&quot; However, Wilson spoke briefly to &quot;The Scotsman&quot; in 2001. Despite his withdrawal from darts, in August 2009, the PDC announced a new tournament called &quot;The Jocky Wilson Cup&quot; in which Scotland&#x27;s best players played England&#x27;s best. England beat Scotland 6–0 in the inaugural tournament in December 2009.

A heavy smoker for 40 years, in November 2009 it was announced that Wilson had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Reports stated that he had smoked up to 50 cigarettes a day for most of his life. He died just after 21:00 on 24 March 2012 at his home in Kirkcaldy, two days after his sixty-second birthday. His funeral was held on 2 April at Kirkcaldy Crematorium; 

== Personal life ==
In 1982, during the Falklands War, Wilson was temporarily banned from competing in darts tournaments after he was involved in &quot;an unseemly brawl&quot; with an official during a championship. According to Wilson&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, this resulted from a remark allegedly by the official relating to Wilson&#x27;s wife, who was named Malvina (the Argentine name for the Falkland Islands is &quot;Islas Malvinas&quot;). He received a temporary ban which stopped him from defending his Unipart trophy title.

Wilson frequently consumed sweets and generally refused to brush his teeth, stating: &quot;My Gran told me the English poison the water&quot;. He had lost his last tooth by the age of 28. Following his 1982 World title win, he paid £1,200 for dentures, but later complained that the dentures made him belch when drinking.

<doc id="1215402" wikidata="Q5248006" url="?curid=1215402" title="Debbie Travis' Facelift">
<text>Debbie Travis&#x27; Facelift was a home improvement reality television show that ran from January 28, 2003 to December 30, 2005. It was produced in Canada for HGTV and also aired in the United States on the American version of the network, Home &amp; Garden Television. It is hosted by interior designer Debbie Travis, and was based out of Montreal, Quebec.

The show&#x27;s format is that of a surprise renovation; a family member or loved one contacts the show to arrange a &#x27;facelift&#x27; of a part of the home for the unsuspecting target(s). By taking advantage of the target&#x27;s absence (or arranging a pretense for it), the &#x27;Facelift team&#x27; moves in for the duration to renovate as quickly as possible. Much of the show&#x27;s drama is based around time and budget constraints in completing the job before the target returns, and upon the reaction of the target once they see the completed work.

The personalities of members of the team have become well known to regular viewers, along with such trademarks as the &quot;Sivart van&quot; (an old-style delivery truck labeled &quot;sivart&quot;, &#x27;Travis&#x27; spelled in reverse), which the team arrives in; Debbie&#x27;s reveal of a possibly-controversial design to skeptical family members; and the &#x27;facelift book&#x27;, a small scrapbook presented to the target after the renovation is revealed, showing what they missed during their absence.

Some &#x27;twists&#x27; that have occurred on various episodes include the target returning early, unexpectedly; vital materials not arriving on time, forcing the team to improvise; and dissatisfied targets demanding a change to the renovation scheme.

<text>Osmán Morote Barrionuevo known with the alias of Comrade Nicolas was one of Efraín Morote Best&#x27;s sons. At one point in his life, he became the Shining Path&#x27;s second-in-command. His two siblings, Arturo and Katia, also became members of the Shining Path, a Maoist insurgency in Peru that launched a terrorist movement.

He was arrested by the Peruvian police on June 11, 1988, on terrorism charges, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In March 1992, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Peru and his sentence was reduced to 15 years. The same year, President Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s regime opened a new trial and Morote was sentenced to life in prison. A new trial started in June 2003.

In 2024, Morote requested a review of his sentencing and a release from prison as he had served 35 years of his sentence. His request for release was denied.

<doc id="1215416" wikidata="Q1153154" url="?curid=1215416" title="Oh My Darling, Clementine">
<text>&quot;Oh, My Darling Clementine&quot; (Roud 9611, sometimes simply &quot;Clementine&quot;) is a traditional American, tragic but sometimes comic, Western folk ballad in trochaic meter usually credited to Percy Montross (or Montrose) (1884), although it is sometimes credited to Barker Bradford.

Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

==Synopsis==
Multiple variations of the song exist, but all center on Clementine, the daughter of a &quot;miner forty-niner&quot; and the singer&#x27;s lover. One day while performing routine chores, Clementine trips and falls into a raging current and drowns, as her lover is unable to swim and declines to attempt to rescue her. In Montross&#x27;s version, the song ends with &quot;Though in life I used to hug her, now she&#x27;s dead – I&#x27;ll draw the line.&quot;

==History and origins==
The lyrics by Percy Montrose were issued as sheet music by Oliver Ditson &amp; Co of Boston in 1884, based on an earlier song called &quot;Down by the River Liv&#x27;d a Maiden&quot;, printed in 1863. The origin of the melody is unknown. In his book &quot;South from Granada&quot;, Gerald Brenan claims that the melody was from an old Spanish ballad, made popular by Mexican miners during the California Gold Rush. It was best known from &quot;Romance del Conde Olinos o Niño&quot;, a sad love story very popular in Spanish-speaking cultures. It was also given various English translations. No particular source is cited to verify that the song he used to hear in the 1920s in a remote Spanish village was not an old text with new music, but Brenan states in his preface that all the information in his book has been checked reasonably well.

It is unclear when, where, and by whom the song was first recorded in English, but the first version to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts was that by Bing Crosby recorded on June 14, 1941, which briefly reached the No. 20 spot. It was given an updated and up-tempo treatment in an arrangement by Hal Hopper and John Scott Trotter. The re-written lyrics include a reference to Gene Autry (&quot;could he sue me, Clementine?&quot;) amongst the five swinging verses.

==Notable versions==
There have been numerous versions of the song recorded over the years.

===Bobby Darin version===
Bobby Darin recorded a version of the song in 1960, with lyrics credited to Woody Harris, in which Clementine is reimagined as a 299-pound woman. After she falls into the water, Darin suggests that Clementine could be mistaken for a whale and calls out to those on the high seas to watch for her, in a rhythm and style reminiscent of Darin&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;: &quot;Hey you sailor, way out in your whaler, with your harpoon and your trusty line, if she shows now, yell... there she blows now. It just may be chunky Clementine.&quot; The song reached #12 in Canada.

===Jan and Dean version===
Jan and Dean had a hit with &quot;Clementine&quot;, charting as high as 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was released on the Dore label (SP DORE 539 (US)) in November, 1959; &quot;You&#x27;re on My Mind&quot; was the B Side.

===Tom Lehrer version===
Tom Lehrer recorded a set of variations on the song in 1959 on his live album &quot;An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer&quot;, demonstrating his theory that &quot;folk songs are so atrocious because they were written by the people.&quot; He performs the first verse in the style of Cole Porter, the second in the style of &quot;Mozart or one of that crowd&quot;, the third in a disjointed bebop sound parodying the style of Beat Generation musicians like Slim Gaillard or Babs Gonzales, and the final verse in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan.

===Other versions===
* When ethnomusicologist Colin Turnbull asked a group of Ituri forest pygmies to sing the oldest song that they knew in 1961, what came out was a strange version of &quot;Clementine&quot;...!

==In popular culture==
===Television===
* In 1986, the song was turned into an episode of the TV series &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot; entitled &quot;My Darlin&#x27; Clementine&quot; with Shelley Duvall as Clementine and narration by Randy Newman.
* In 1992, Peter Brooke, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, sang &quot;Darlin&#x27; Clementine&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Irish television. Just hours earlier, eight people (seven of them civilians) had been killed in the Teebane bombing. Brooke was forced to resign shortly after.
* In the 2001 &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Murder With Too Many Notes&quot;, Lieutenant Columbo, played by Peter Falk, sings the first verse of the song along with Billy Connolly&#x27;s character Findlay Crawford. Columbo also sings the song in the 1978 episode &quot;Make Me A Perfect Murder&quot;.
* A mangled rendition of &quot;Darling Clementine&quot; is animated coonhound Huckleberry Hound&#x27;s signature tune, sung in most episodes of the cartoon series &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;. But it often ends up as &quot;Oh my darling what&#x27;s her name&quot;.
* In the Season 5 &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Movie Tonight&quot;, aired February 22, 1977, character Colonel Potter, played by Harry Morgan, sings the lyrics, &quot;In a cavern in a canyon excavating for a mine...&quot; during the last scene of the episode while the crew is performing surgery on wounded soldiers. The rest of the crew joins in on a sing-along. The episode ends when they all sing the lyric, &quot;Dreadful sorry, Clementine.&quot; This occurs after the 4077th M*A*S*H views the 1946 John Ford classic film &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;.

===Use of melody===
* The melody is used in &quot;Xīnnián Hǎo&quot; (), a New Year and Chinese New Year song.
* The melody is used in &quot;Dip The Apple In The Honey&quot;, a Jewish New Year song.
*In the 1956 Hindi film &quot;C.I.D.&quot;, the melody of this song was used in the song &quot;Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan&quot;.
* The chorus to Cher Lloyd&#x27;s 2011 single &quot;Swagger Jagger&quot; was seen as heavily borrowed from the melody of &quot;Oh My Darling Clementine&quot;
* The melody is used in &quot;Picked a Strawberry&quot;, a library storytime song made by the librarian duo called Jbrary.
*The melody is used in the song &quot;There Are Seven Days (In A Week)&quot;, from &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;.
*The melody is used in an Indonesian children&#x27;s song &quot;Makan Apa&quot;.

===Other===
* In the 1945 novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, the pig Old Major explains his dream of an animal-controlled society, and ends by singing &quot;Beasts of England&quot;. The song&#x27;s tune is described in the novel as sounding like a combination of &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; and &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot;.
* In the novel &quot;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; by Suzanne Collins, the character Maude Ivory sings the song and declares that she wants to wear sandals like Clementine. The character is part of a band that performs folk songs, and lives in a far-future, dystopian Appalachia.

It is the first handheld game in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series and the seventh entry in the series overall. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console for the Wii U in 2014.

&quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; differs from other titles in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series in its focus on one single-player mode rather than several multiplayer modes. However, traditional &quot;Mario Party&quot; gameplay is present in players choosing a character from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, moving around an interactive game board, and playing a variety of minigames.

Upon release, the game received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom panned its single-player focus. Retrospectively, &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; is widely considered to be one of the worst games in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series by critics and is one of the worst rated &quot;Mario&quot; games of all time on review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was succeeded by &quot;Mario Party 7&quot; for the GameCube the same year of its release.

== Gameplay ==
The player can choose from four different playable characters of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Yoshi. The player drives a car around a game board, similar to those seen in the previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games. The player&#x27;s starting area on the board depends on which character is selected. The player starts with four Mushrooms. Additional Mushrooms are earned by winning minigames that are played every three turns. The game ends when there are no Mushrooms left. The multiplayer Party Mode that was present in all of the previous &quot;Mario Party&quot; games is no longer available, and it has been replaced by a new mode called &quot;Shroom City&quot;. The aim of the game is to collect all the minigames and &quot;Gaddgets&quot; that were scattered around Shroom City by Bowser, by completing quests assigned to the player by the various inhabitants of Shroom City.

Gaddgets, invented by Professor E. Gadd, are interactive items such as a Morse code generator and a love meter. The game includes over 120 minigames, including Gaddgets. Approximately 12 of the minigames can be played in multiplayer mode, with the use of a Game Link Cable. Certain Gaddgets can also be played in multiplayer mode if players control different buttons on a single Game Boy Advance system. The game also included a paper game board for multiple players that could be played in conjunction with the game cartridge, used by players to roll the dice and to play minigames.

==Development and release==
&quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; was developed by Hudson Soft and A.I and published by Nintendo. The game was revealed alongside &quot;Mario Pinball Land&quot; in April 2004. &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; was subsequently showcased at E3 2004, with an original release date of December 6, 2004, which was later pushed back to March 28, 2005. The game&#x27;s initial release date coinciding with &quot;Mario Party 6&quot;″s North American release date led &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Chris Kohler to speculate that there could be interconnected gameplay between the titles, though this ultimately was not the case.

&quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; was released in Japan on January 13, 2005, in North America on March 28, 2005, and in Europe on June 10, 2005. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console for the Wii U in North America and Europe on December 25, 2014, and in Japan on October 28, 2015.

== Reception ==
&quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, four critics from &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a total score of 27 out of 40.

While the game contains a large number of minigames and unlockables, reviewers criticized the game&#x27;s tendency to punish players based on random chance, rebuked the game for lack of innovation in the minigames, and expressed concerns about the game&#x27;s limited multiplayer modes. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s &quot;incredibly basic and rudimentary graphic and sound presentation&quot;, as well as its &quot;slowpaced&quot; single-player mode, its large amount of dialogue, and wrote that most of its minigames &quot;are actually on the bland side, featuring some rudimentary platform challenges or memory games that have been done a billion times before in other games. The 2D environment must have restricted the team&#x27;s creativity in providing some challenges that are imaginative &quot;and&quot; fun.&quot; Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes &quot;fairly limited and poorly organized&quot;, but said the single-player mode &quot;is very nicely organized and offers a great deal of variety&quot;. Provo praised the &quot;colorful&quot; character sprites, but criticized the game&#x27;s &quot;bland&quot; backgrounds and some of its minigames.

Kristan Reed of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave the game a score of 1/10, writing that it was &quot;practically the dictionary definition of awful&quot;, noting that &quot;most - if not all - of its hundred odd mini games are among some of the most insultingly undemanding and badly-designed efforts you&#x27;ll ever see associated with the beloved franchise&quot;. Reed said &quot;a typical game within &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; is often tedious, badly designed and completely lacking in any endearing qualities at all. [...] Animation is virtually non existent, the tedious chatty exchanges that take place between characters lacks any imagination at all and the whole project just smells like something thrown together to meet a contractual obligation&quot;. Reed concluded: &quot;And if you haven&#x27;t got the message yet, &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; is possibly the worst videogame Nintendo has had the misfortune to publish. Avoid at all costs; this is disgracefully bad.&quot; Karen Chu of &quot;1UP.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Though I&#x27;m open to new possibilities and reinterpretations of &quot;Mario Party&quot;, playing this game made me want to just jump on my Gamecube and play the original console versions -- even if I have to play against 3 CPU players because frankly, being the only player on a board game that&#x27;s advertised as a party is just disheartening.&quot;

Retrospectively, &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; is widely considered to be one of the worst &quot;Mario Party&quot; games. The game&#x27;s Metacritic score of 54 out of 100 is the worst for any &quot;Mario Party&quot; title, as well as any &quot;Mario&quot; game.

In 2015, &quot;IGN&quot; listed the game at the bottom of its list of &quot;Best Mario Party Games&quot;, writing, &quot;&quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; is the black sheep of the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series. This handheld version forwent the classic style of four players collecting stars and coins in favor of a single player focused mode. The heart of the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series lies in its multiplayer, so while this new approach brought a few interesting ideas, it never achieved what made all the other games so enticing.&quot;

In 2022, &quot;Digital Trends&quot; placed &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; 16th in its ranking of 18 &quot;Mario Party&quot; games. In 2023, &quot;TheGamer&quot; listed the game just above &quot;Mario Party-e&quot; in its &quot;Every Mario Party Game, Ranked&quot; list, complimenting its minigames while criticizing its focus on a single-player experience, stating &quot;Mario Party Advance isn&#x27;t a bad game. Most of the minigames are fun, but it’s tailored to a single-player experience&quot;. Concluding: &quot;Though it is admirable that Nintendo put a lot of work into making a portable Party experience, the game falters in one critical area: it isn&#x27;t much of a party&quot;. In 2024, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; listed &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; second-to-last in its ranking of every &quot;Mario Party&quot; game after &quot;Mario Party: The Top 100&quot;, excluding &quot;Mario Party-e&quot; and the arcade games.

<doc id="1215418" wikidata="Q330662" url="?curid=1215418" title="Juhayman al-Otaybi">
<text>Juhayman ibn Muhammad ibn Sayf al-Otaybi (; 16 September 1936 – 9 January 1980) was a Saudi religious dissident and ex-soldier who led the Ikhwan during their Grand Mosque seizure in 1979. He and his followers besieged and took over the Grand Mosque of Mecca on 20 November 1979 (1 Muharram 1400) and held it for two weeks. During this time, he called for an uprising against the House of Saud and also reportedly proclaimed that the Mahdi had arrived in the form of one of the Ikhwan&#x27;s leading officials; al-Otaybi&#x27;s insurgency ended with Saudi authorities capturing the surviving militants and publicly executing them all, including al-Otaybi. The incident led to widespread unrest, culminating in large-scale anti-American riots throughout the Muslim world, particularly after Iranian religious cleric Ruhollah Khomeini of the Islamic Revolution claimed over a radio broadcast that Juhayman&#x27;s insurgency at the holiest Islamic site had been orchestrated by the United States and Israel.

==Biography==
Juhayman al-Otaybi was born in al-Sajir, Al-Qassim Province, a settlement established by King Abdulaziz to house Ikhwan Bedouin tribesmen who had fought for him. This settlement (known as a hijra) was populated by members of his tribe, the &#x27;Utaybah, one of the most pre-eminent tribes of the Najd region. Many of Juhayman&#x27;s relatives participated in the Battle of Sabilla during the Ikhwan uprising against King Abdulaziz, including his father and grandfather, Sultan bin Bajad al-Otaybi. Juhayman grew up aware of the battle and of how, in their eyes, the Saudi monarchs had betrayed the original religious principles of the Saudi state. He finished school without fluent writing ability, but he loved to read religious texts.

He served in the Saudi Arabian National Guard from 1955 to 1973. He was thin and 6&#x27;2 (188 cm) in height according to his friends in the National Guard. His son, Hathal bin Juhayman al-Otaybi, who works for the National Guard, was promoted to the rank of colonel in 2018.

==Education==
Otaybi did not complete primary education, but he attended school until the fourth grade. After his military service he moved to Medina. There he attended religious courses at the Islamic University, where he met with Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al Qahtani.

Otaybi, upon moving to Medina, joined the local chapter of a Salafi group called &quot;Al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Muhtasiba&quot; (The Salafi group that commands right and forbids wrong), which was founded in the mid-1960s by several of Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani&#x27;s disciples. Many of the group&#x27;s members and scholars were either of Bedouin descent or non-Saudis residents, and therefore marginalized in the religious establishment. Their activism was at least partially motivated by this marginalization. Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz used his religious stature to arrange fundraising for the group, and Otaybi earned money by buying, repairing and re-selling cars from city auctions.

Otaybi lived in a &quot;makeshift compound&quot; about a half hour&#x27;s walk to the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque, and his followers stayed in a nearby dirt-floored hostel called Bayt al-Ikhwan (&quot;House of the Brothers&quot;). Otaybi and his devotees obeyed an austere and simple lifestyle, searching the Quran and Hadith for scriptural evidence of what was permissible not only for their beliefs but in their day-to-day lives. Otaybi was perturbed by the encroachment of Western beliefs and &quot;Bid‘ah&quot; (, innovation) in Saudi society to the detriment of what he believed to be true Islam. He opposed the integration of women into the workforce, television, the immodest shorts worn by football players during matches, and Saudi currency with an image of the King on it.

By 1977, ibn Baz had departed to Riyadh and Otaybi became the leader of a faction of young recruits that developed their own—sometimes unorthodox—religious doctrines. When older members of the Jamaa travelled to Medina to confront Otaybi about these developments, the two factions split from each other. Otaybi attacked the elder sheikhs as government sellouts and called his new group &quot;Ikhwan—&quot;the name of a Wahhabi religious militia who first fought for the House of Saud in the 1920s against the Hashemites and then revolted against them in 1929.

In the late 1970s, he moved to Riyadh, where he drew the attention of the Saudi security forces. He and approximately 100 of his followers were arrested in the summer of 1978 for demonstrating against the monarchy, but were released after ibn Baz questioned them and pronounced them harmless.

He married both the daughter of Prince Sajer Al Mohaya and the sister of Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al Qahtani.

His doctrines are said to have included:

# The imperative to emulate the Prophet&#x27;s example—revelation, propagation, and military takeover.
# The necessity for the Muslims to overthrow their present corrupt rulers who are forced upon them and lack Islamic attributes since the Quran recognizes no king or dynasty.
# The requirements for legitimate rulership are devotion to Islam and its practice, rulership by the Holy Book and not by repression, Qurayshi tribal roots, and election by the Muslim believers.
# The duty to base the Islamic faith on the Quran and the sunnah and not on the equivocal interpretations (&quot;taqlid&quot;) of the ulama and on their &quot;incorrect&quot; teachings in the schools and universities.
# The necessity to isolate oneself from the sociopolitical system by refusing to accept any official positions.
# The advent of the Mahdi from the lineage of the Prophet through Husayn ibn Ali to remove the existing injustices and bring equity and peace to the faithful.
# The duty to reject those who associate partners with God (&quot;mushrikeen&quot;), particularly those who worship Ali, Fatimah and Muhammad.
# The duty to establish a puritanical Islamic community which protects Islam from unbelievers and does not court foreigners.
==Insurgency==
As his militants seized the Grand Mosque of Mecca and took hostages, Juhayman publicly denounced the House of Saud as corrupt and illegitimate, accusing the country&#x27;s royals of pursuing alliances with &quot;Christian infidels&quot; and importing secularism into Saudi society. The nature of his allegations echoed that of the charges that his father had brought against Ibn Saud in 1921. Unlike earlier anti-monarchy dissidents in Saudi Arabia, Juhayman directly attacked the country&#x27;s &quot;ulama&quot; for failing to protest against Saudi government policies that betrayed Islam; he accused them of accepting the rule of an infidel state and of offering their loyalty to corrupt rulers &quot;in exchange for honours and riches&quot; amidst broader discontent against what he perceived as their un-Islamic teachings.

Consisting of 300 to 600 well-organized militants under Juhayman&#x27;s leadership, the Ikhwan took hostages from among the worshippers at the Grand Mosque and fought against the Saudi military&#x27;s attempts to retake it, leading to approximately 800 casualties in total. The Saudi government requested urgent aid from France, which responded by dispatching advisory units from the GIGN to the site. After French operatives provided them with a special type of tear gas that dulls aggression and obstructs breathing, Saudi troops gassed the interior of the Grand Mosque and successfully forced entry. Juhayman was captured during the assault, sentenced to death by Saudi authorities, and subsequently executed by beheading on 9 January 1980.

<text>Trajan&#x27;s Bridge (; ), also called Bridge of Apollodorus over the Danube, was a Roman segmental arch bridge, the first bridge to be built over the lower Danube and considered one of the greatest achievements in Roman architecture. Though it was only functional for 165 years, it is often considered to have been the longest arch bridge in both total span and length for more than 1,000 years.

The bridge was completed in 105 AD and designed by Emperor Trajan&#x27;s architect Apollodorus of Damascus before the Second Dacian War to allow Roman troops to cross the river. Fragmentary ruins of the bridge&#x27;s piers are still in existence.
== The site ==

The bridge was situated east of the Iron Gates, near the present-day cities of Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania and Kladovo in Serbia. Its construction was ordered by the Emperor Trajan as a supply route for the Roman legions fighting in Dacia.

Construction of the bridge was part of a wider project, which included the digging of side canals so that whitewater rapids could be avoided to make the Danube safer for navigation enabling an effective river fleet, a string of defense posts and development of the intelligence service on the border.

The remains of the embankment which protected the area during the construction of the canal (in a loop to the south of the Danube) show the magnitude of the works. The long canal bypassed the problematic section of the river in an arch-like style. Former canals eventually filled with sand, and empty shells are regularly found in the ground.

All these works, especially the bridge, served the purpose of preparing for the Roman invasion of Dacia, which ended with Roman victory in 106 AD. The effect of finally defeating the Dacians and acquiring their gold mines was so great that Roman games celebrating the conquest lasted for 123 days, with 10,000 gladiators engaging in fights and 11,000 wild animals being killed during that period.

The bridge was long (the Danube is now wide in that area), wide, and high, measured from the surface of the river. At each end was a Roman fort so that crossing the bridge was only possible through the camps.

On the south bank, at the modern village of Kostol near Kladovo, the Pontes fort was built in 103, concurrently with the bridge, occupying several hectares. Remnants of the long castrum with thick ramparts are still visible today. A &quot;vicus&quot; (civilian settlement) grew up around it later. A bronze head of Emperor Trajan has been discovered in Pontes, part of a statue which was erected at the bridge entrance and is today kept in the National Museum in Belgrade.

On the north bank is the Drobeta fort. It also had a bronze statue of Trajan.

==Design and construction==

Apollodorus used wooden arches, each spanning , set on twenty masonry pillars made of bricks, mortar, and pozzolana cement. It was built unusually quickly (between 103 and 105), employing the construction of a wooden caisson for each pier.

Apollodorus applied the technique of river flow relocation, using the principles set by Thales of Miletus some six centuries beforehand. Engineers waited for a low water level to dig a canal, west of the modern downtown of Kladovo. The water was redirected downstream from the construction site, through the lowland of , to the location of the modern village of Mala Vrbica. Wooden pillars were driven into the river bed in a rectangular layout, which served as the foundation for the supporting piers, which were coated with clay. The hollow piers were filled with stones held together by mortar, while from the outside they were built around with Roman bricks. The bricks can still be found around the village of Kostol, retaining the same physical properties that they had 2 millennia ago. The piers were tall, wide and apart. It is considered today that the bridge construction was assembled on the land and then installed on the pillars. A mitigating circumstance was that the year the relocating canals were dug was very dry and the water level was quite low. The river bed was almost completely drained when the foundation of the pillars began. There were 20 pillars in total in an interval of . Oak wood was used and the bridge was high enough to allow ship transport on the Danube.

The bricks also have a historical value, as the members of the Roman legions and cohorts which participated in the construction of the bridge carved the names of their units into the bricks. Thus, it is known that work was done by the legions of IV Flavia Felix, VII Claudia, V Macedonica and XIII Gemina and the cohorts of I Cretum, II Hispanorum, III Brittonum and I Antiochensium.

== Tabula Traiana ==

A Roman memorial plaque (&quot;Tabula Traiana&quot;), 4 metres wide and 1.75 metres high, commemorating the completion of Trajan&#x27;s military road is located on the Serbian side facing Romania near Ogradina, 29 km west of the bridge. In 1972, when the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station was built (causing the water level to rise by about 35 m), the plaque was moved from its original location, and lifted to the present place. It reads:

:IMP. CAESAR. DIVI. NERVAE. F&lt;br&gt;NERVA TRAIANVS. AVG. GERM&lt;br&gt;PONTIF MAXIMUS TRIB POT IIII &lt;br&gt;PATER PATRIAE COS III&lt;br&gt;MONTIBVS EXCISI(s) ANCO(ni)BVS&lt;br&gt;SVBLAT(i)S VIA(m) F(ecit)

The text was interpreted by Otto Benndorf to mean:
:Emperor Caesar son of the divine Nerva, Nerva Trajan, the Augustus, Germanicus, Pontifex Maximus, invested for the fourth time as Tribune, Father of the Fatherland, Consul for the third time, excavating mountain rocks and using wood beams has made this road.

The Tabula Traiana was declared a &quot;Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance&quot; in 1979, and is protected by the Republic of Serbia.

=== Relocation ===

When the plan for the future hydro plant and its reservoir was made in 1965, it was clear that numerous settlements along the banks would be flooded in both Yugoslavia and Romania, and that historical remains, including the plaque, would also be affected. Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts urged for the plaque to be preserved and the government accepted the motion. The enterprise entrusted with the task of relocation was the mining company &quot;Venčac&quot; as its experts previously participated in the relocation of the Abu Simbel temple in Egypt.

First idea was to leave the plaque at its position and to build the caisson around it but the calculations showed this would not work. The idea of cutting the plaque in several smaller pieces in order to be moved was abandoned due to the quality of the rock of which it was made. The proposition of lifting it with the floating elevator &quot;Veli Jože&quot; was discarded, too. The motion of cutting the table in one piece and placing it somewhere else was rejected as the plaque would lose its authenticity.

In the end it was decided to dig in a new bed into the rock above the plaque&#x27;s original location. The plaque was then cut in one piece with the parts of the surrounding rock and road. After being cut with the cable saws, the 350 tons heavy chunk was lifted to the new bed. Works began in September 1967 and were finished in 1969.

== Destruction and remains ==

The wooden superstructure of the bridge was dismantled by Trajan&#x27;s successor, Hadrian, presumably in order to protect the empire from barbarian invasions from the north. The superstructure was destroyed by fire.

The remains of the bridge reappeared in 1858 when the level of the Danube hit a record low due to the extensive drought. The twenty pillars were still visible.

In 1906, the Commission of the Danube decided to destroy two of the pillars that were obstructing navigation.

In 1932, there were 16 pillars remaining underwater, but in 1982 only 12 were mapped by archaeologists; the other four had probably been swept away by water. Only the entrance pillars are now visible on either bank of the Danube, one in Romania and one in Serbia.

In 1979, Trajan&#x27;s Bridge was added to the &quot;Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance&quot;, and in 1983 on &quot;Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance&quot; list, and by that it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.

<doc id="1215425" wikidata="Q211453" url="?curid=1215425" title="Beast of Gévaudan">
<text>The Beast of Gévaudan (, ; ) is the historic name associated with a man-eating animal or animals that terrorized the former province of Gévaudan (consisting of the modern-day department of Lozère and part of Haute-Loire), in the Margeride Mountains of south-central France between 1764 and 1767.

The attacks, which covered an area spanning , were said to have been committed by one or more beasts of a tawny/russet colour with dark streaks/stripes and a dark stripe down its back, a tail &quot;longer than a wolf&#x27;s&quot; ending in a tuft according to contemporary eyewitnesses. It was said to attack with formidable teeth and claws, and appeared to be the size of a calf or cow and seemed to fly or bound across fields towards its victims. These descriptions from the period could identify the beast as a young lion, a striped hyena, a large wolf, a large dog, or a wolfdog, though its identity is still the subject of debate and remains unsolved to this day. 

The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of wealth and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 210 attacks, resulting in 113 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten. Other sources claim the animal or animals killed between 60 and 100 adults and children and injured more than 30. Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. Several animals identified as the beast were reportedly killed before the attacks finally stopped.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The Beast of Gévaudan committed its first recorded attack in the early summer of 1764. A young woman, who was tending cattle in the Mercoire Forest near the town of Langogne in the eastern part of Gévaudan, saw a beast &quot;like a wolf, yet not a wolf&quot; come at her. However, the bulls in the herd charged the beast, keeping it at bay. They then drove it off after it attacked a second time. Shortly afterwards, on 30 June, the beast&#x27;s first official victim was recorded: 14-year-old Jeanne Boulet was killed near the village of Les Hubacs near Langogne. On 1 July, this victim was buried &quot;without sacraments&quot; because she could not confess before her death. However, the burial certificate specifies that she was killed by &quot;the ferocious beast&quot; (French: la bette [&quot;sic&quot;] féroce), which suggests that she is not the first victim but only the first declared. A second victim was reported on 8 August. Aged 14, she lived in the hamlet of Masméjean, in the parish of Puy-Laurent. These two victims were killed in the Allier valley.

From the end of August and in September, other victims were recorded in the Mercoire Forest or its surroundings. Throughout the remainder of 1764, more attacks were reported in the region. Very soon, terror gripped the populace because the beast was repeatedly preying on lone men, women, and children as they tended livestock in the forests around Gévaudan. Reports note that the beast seemed only to target the victim&#x27;s head or neck regions. Some witnesses claimed the beast had supernatural abilities. They believed it could walk on its hind legs and feet like humans. They believed the beast performed astounding leaps. They also believed the beast could repel bullets and come back from the dead after being struck and wounded.

===Increased attention===
By late December 1764, rumours had begun circulating that there might be a pair of animals behind the killings. This was because there had been such a high number of attacks in such a short space of time and because many of the attacks appeared to have occurred or were reported nearly simultaneously. Some contemporary accounts suggest the creature was seen with another such animal, while others report that the beast was accompanied by its young.

On 31 December, the Bishop of Mende Gabriel-Florent de Choiseul-Beaupré, also Count of Gévaudan, called for prayers and penance. This appeal has remained in history under the name of &quot;commandment of the Bishop of Mende&quot;. All the priests of the diocese had to announce it to their faithful. In this long text, the bishop described the beast as a scourge sent by God to punish men for their sins. He quoted Saint Augustine in evoking the &quot;justice of God&quot;, as well as the Bible and the divine threats uttered by Moses: &quot;I will arm the teeth of wild beasts against them&quot;. Following this commandment, prayers of Forty Hours&#x27; Devotion were observed for three consecutive Sundays.

In spite of these divine pleas, the massacre continued. On 12 January 1765, Jacques Portefaix and seven children from the village of Villaret, in the parish of Chanaleilles, were attacked by the beast. After several attacks, they drove it away by staying grouped together. The encounter eventually came to the attention of King Louis XV, who awarded 300 livres to Portefaix and another 350 livres to be shared among his companions. The king also rewarded Portefaix with an education at the state&#x27;s expense. He then decreed that the French state would help find and kill the beast. On 11 February, in the parish of Le Malzieu, was buried a little girl &quot;about twelve years old who had been partly devoured on the present day by a man-eating beast that has been ravaging this country for nearly three months&quot;.

By April 1765, the story of the beast had spread throughout Europe. The &quot;Courrier d&#x27;Avignon&quot; and English journalists made fun of the impotence of royal power in the face of a simple animal. Meanwhile, the local bishop and the intendants had to deal with an influx of mail; people from all over France suggesting more or less eccentric methods to overcome the beast. The court also issued depictions of the beast in Gévaudan so that &quot;everyone [was] less terrified at his approach and less likely to be mistaken&quot; and so that the packs of hunting dogs could be trained to chase the beast thanks to an effigy &quot;executed in cardboard&quot;.

===Royal intervention===
First Captain Duhamel of the Clermont Prince dragoons and his troops were soon sent to Gévaudan. Although extremely zealous in his efforts, non-cooperation on the part of the local herders and farmers stalled Duhamel&#x27;s efforts. On several occasions he almost shot the beast, but was hampered by the incompetence of his guards. When the village of Le Malzieu was not present and ready as the beast crossed the Truyère river, Duhamel became frustrated.

When Louis XV agreed to send two professional wolf hunters, Jean Charles Marc Antoine Vaumesle d&#x27;Enneval and his son Jean-François, Captain Duhamel was forced to stand down and return to his headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand. Cooperating with d&#x27;Enneval was impossible as the two differed too much in their strategies; Duhamel organised wolf hunting parties while d&#x27;Enneval and his son believed the beast could only be shot using stealthy techniques. Father and son D&#x27;Enneval arrived in Clermont-Ferrand on 17 February 1765, bringing eight bloodhounds that had been trained in wolf hunting. Over the next four months, the pair hunted for Eurasian wolves, believing that one or more of these animals was the beast. However, when the attacks continued, the D&#x27;Ennevals were replaced in June 1765 by François Antoine (sometimes wrongly identified with his son, Antoine de Beauterne), the king&#x27;s sole arquebus bearer and lieutenant of the Hunt, who arrived in Le Malzieu on 22 June.

On 11 August, Antoine organised a great hunt. That day saw the feat of the &quot;Maid of Gévaudan&quot;. Marie-Jeanne Vallet, about 20 years old, was the servant of the parish priest of Paulhac. In the company of other peasant women, she was taking a footbridge to cross a small stream when the beast appeared. The women took a few steps back but the beast threw itself on Marie-Jeanne. The latter managed to plant her spear into its chest. The beast dropped into the river and disappeared into the woods. The story quickly reached Antoine, who went to the scene. He found that the spear was indeed covered in blood and that the traces found were similar to those of the beast. In a letter to Saint-Florentin, Minister of the King&#x27;s House, comparing Marie-Jeanne to Joan of Arc, he nicknamed her the &quot;Maid of Gévaudan&quot;.

On 20 or 21 September, Antoine killed a large grey wolf measuring high, long and weighing . The wolf, which was named &quot;Le Loup de Chazes&quot; after the nearby Abbaye des Chazes, was said to have been quite large for a wolf. Antoine officially stated: &quot;We declare by the present report signed from our hand, we never saw a big wolf that could be compared to this one. Hence, we believe this could be the fearsome beast that caused so much damage.&quot; The animal was further identified as the culprit by several attack survivors, who recognised the scars on its body inflicted by victims defending themselves. Among them were Marie-Jeanne Vallet and her sister.

After the report was written, François Antoine&#x27;s son loaded the animal onto his horse and set off for Paris. At Saint-Flour, he showed it to Monsieur de Montluc. In Clermont-Ferrand, he had it stuffed. He left Clermont on 27 September and arrived at Versailles on 1 October, where he was hailed as a hero. The beast was exhibited in the Jardins du Roi. Meanwhile, François Antoine and his gamekeepers stayed in the Auvergne woods to chase down the beast&#x27;s female partner and her two grown pups, which had been reported near the Abbey of Chazes. On 19 October, Antoine succeeded in killing the female wolf and a pup, which seemed already larger than its mother. At the examination of the pup, it appeared to have a double set of dewclaws, a hereditary malformation found in the Bas-Rouge or Beauceron dog breed. The other pup was shot and hit and was believed to have died while retreating between the rocks. Antoine returned to Paris on 3 November and received a large sum of money (over 9,000 livres) as well as fame, titles, and awards.

===Final attacks===
The month of November passed without any attack being reported. The populace dared to believe that Antoine had indeed killed the beast. In a letter from 26 November, the syndic Étienne Lafont affirmed to the intendant of Languedoc: &quot;We no longer hear of anything relating to the beast&quot;. But quickly, rumours spread of new attacks, towards Saugues and Lorcières. On 2 December, two boys aged 6 and 12 were further attacked, suggesting that the beast was still alive. The beast tried to capture the youngest, but it was successfully fought off by the older boy. Soon after, successful attacks followed and some of the shepherds witnessed that the beast showed no fear around cattle at all. A dozen more deaths are reported to have followed attacks near La Besseyre-Saint-Mary.

Until the beginning of 1766, these facts remained episodic and no one knew if they were attributable to the beast or to wolves. However, in a letter he wrote to the intendant of Auvergne on 1 January 1766, Monsieur de Montluc seemed convinced that the beast had indeed reappeared. The intendant alerted the king, but Louis XV no longer wanted to hear about a ferocious beast that his arquebus bearer had overcome. From then on, newspapers no longer reported any of the attacks that occurred in Gévaudan or in the south of Auvergne.

In March 1766, the attacks multiplied. The local gentlemen now knew that their salvation would not come from the court. On 24 March, the Particular Estates of Gévaudan were held at Marvejols. Étienne Lafont and the young Marquis d&#x27;Apcher, a local nobleman, recommend poisoning the corpses of dogs and carrying them to the usual passages of the beast. But the latter did not seem to cover as much ground as before; it settled in the Trois Monts region—Mont Mouchet, Mont Grand and Montchauvet—about apart.

The measures taken proved ineffective. Small hunts were organised in vain. The beast continued its attacks throughout 1766. But its mode of operation had changed: it seemed less enterprising and much more cautious, as revealed by various correspondence, including that of Canon Ollier, parish priest of Lorcières, to Étienne Lafont.

At the beginning of 1767, the attacks experienced a slight lull, but they resumed in the spring. The populace no longer knew what to do, except to pray. Pilgrimages were increasing, mainly to Notre-Dame-de-Beaulieu and Notre-Dame-d&#x27;Estours. On 18 June, it was reported to the Marquis d&#x27;Apcher that the beast had been seen the day before in the parishes of Nozeyrolles and Desges. In the latter, in the village of Lesbinières, it allegedly killed 19-year-old Jeanne Bastide.

===Killing by Jean Chastel===
The killing of the creature that eventually marked the end of the attacks is credited to a local hunter named Jean Chastel, who shot it at the slopes of Mont Mouchet (now called la Sogne d&#x27;Auvers) during a hunt organised by the Marquis d&#x27;Apcher on 19 June 1767. In 1889, Abbot Pourcher told the edifying oral tradition which said that the pious hero Chastel shot the creature after reciting his prayers but the historical accounts do not report any such thing. The story about the large-caliber bullets, home-made with Virgin Mary&#x27;s medals, is a literary invention by the French writer Henri Pourrat.

The body was then loaded onto a horse and brought to the Château de Besque of the Marquis d&#x27;Apchier, located in Charraix, where it was necropsied by Dr. Boulanger, a surgeon at Saugues. Dr. Boulanger&#x27;s post-mortem report was transcribed by the royal notary Roch Étienne Marin and is known as the &quot;Marin Report&quot; on the beast; the results of the examination were consistent with a large wolf or wolf-dog, but the remains were incomplete by the time Boulanger acquired them, precluding conclusive identification of the animal. The beast was then exhibited at the château, where the Marquis d&#x27;Apcher lavishly received crowds, which thronged to see the remains. Numerous testimonies from victims of attacks enriched the Marin Report. The beast stayed in Besque for a dozen days.

===Fate of the remains===
The Marquis d&#x27;Apcher instructed a servant named Gibert to take the beast to Versailles to show it to the king. According to an oral tradition reported by Abbot Pourcher and repeated by several authors, Jean Chastel would have been on the trip, but Louis XV would have disdainfully rejected him because the remains, summarily stuffed by an apothecary who had contented himself with replacing the entrails with straw, gave off a stench that the heat made even more unbearable. However, this version is called into question by the testimony of the servant of the Marquis d&#x27;Apcher, collected in 1809: 

It emerges that Jean Chastel did not accompany Gibert to Paris. Likewise, the servant never presented the remains of the beast to the court of Louis XV. Finally, Buffon left no document on this subject. Neither kept in the collections of the Jardin du Roi in Paris, nor buried in Marly or Versailles, the beast was probably buried in the garden of the private mansion of Louis Alexandre de La Rochefoucauld, a gentleman sharing a distant common ancestor with the Marquis of Apcher. The hotel of La Rochefoucauld, located on the Rue de Seine, would be demolished in 1825.

The attacks in Gévaudan ceased definitively. The authorities of the diocese granted rewards to the hunters: Jean Chastel received 72 livres on 9 September; Jean Terrisse received 78 livres on 17 September; the hunters who accompanied them shared 312 livres on 3 May 1768.

==Description==

===Morphology===
Various questions about the nature of the Beast of Gévaudan have aroused interest and contributed to the enthusiasm for its history. Descriptions of the time vary, and reports may have been greatly exaggerated, owing to public hysteria. In terms of morphology, although none of the killed animals have been preserved, the beast was generally described as a wolf-like canine with a tall, lean frame capable of taking great strides. It was said to be the size of a calf, a cow, or, in some cases, a horse. It had an elongated head similar to that of a greyhound, with a flattened snout, pointed ears, and a wide mouth sitting atop a broad chest. The beast&#x27;s tail was also reported to have been notably longer than a wolf&#x27;s, with a prominent tuft at the end. The beast&#x27;s fur was described as tawny or russet in colour but its back was streaked with black, and a white heart-shaped pattern was noted on its underbelly.

===Behaviour===
Several tales spoke of the beast&#x27;s invulnerability. Indeed, hit by the bullets of reputedly skilled shooters, the beast would have risen each time. Testimonies attributed to the beast a gift of ubiquity. In a very short interval of time, it would have been seen in places several kilometres away. However, in many cases, these distances could be covered by a single animal. Two of the beast&#x27;s most singular traits were its familiarity and his boldness. At least until François Antoine&#x27;s departure, it did not seem to fear man. When it encountered resistance, it would move &quot;40 paces&quot; away, sometimes sitting on its hindquarters for a few moments and, if not pursued, would come back to the charge. Then it would move away at a walk or a short trot. Several victims were attacked in the middle of villages and most of the testimonies related to attacks during the day. Finally, by showing a relentlessness that did not always seem dictated by hunger, the beast showed an astonishing aggressiveness. In addition, its unusual agility allowed it to jump over walls that a dog could not cross.

==The &quot;Marin Report&quot;==
On 20 June 1767, the day after the death of the animal killed by Jean Chastel, the royal notary Roch Étienne Marin wrote an autopsy report at the Marquis d&#x27;Apcher&#x27;s Château de Besque in Charraix. Preserved in the French National Archives, this memoir was discovered in 1952 by the historian Élise Seguin. It provides precise information on &quot;This animal which seemed to us to be a wolf; But extraordinary and very different by its figure and its proportions from the wolves that one sees in this country.&quot;

The report also details the dental formula. The upper jaw consists of 20 teeth: 6 incisors, 2 canines and 12 molars; the lower jaw has 22: 6 incisors, 2 canines and 14 molars. This likely points to a canid. The document also describes the animal&#x27;s wounds and scars. Finally, it includes the testimonies of several people who recognised it.

==Hypotheses==
According to modern scholars, public hysteria at the time of the attacks contributed to widespread myths that supernatural beasts roamed Gévaudan, but deaths attributed to a beast were more likely to have been the work of a number of wolves or packs of wolves.

Attacks by wolves were a very serious problem during the era, not only in France but throughout Europe, with thousands of deaths attributed to wolves in the 18th century alone. In the spring of 1765, in the midst of the Gévaudan hysteria, an unrelated series of attacks occurred near the commune of Soissons, northeast of Paris, when an individual wolf killed at least four people over a period of two days before being tracked and killed by a man armed with a pitchfork. Such incidents were fairly typical in rural parts of both Western Europe and Central Europe.

The Marin Report describes the creature as a wolf of unusually large proportions: &quot;This animal which seemed to us to be a wolf; But extraordinary and very different by its figure and its proportions from the wolves that one sees in this country. This is what we have certified by more than three hundred people from all around who came to see it.&quot;

Despite the widely held interpretation based on most of the historical research that the beast was a wolf or another wild canid, several alternative theories have been proposed; some think a lion (namely a subadult male) escaped from a menagerie, due to the size and some descriptions being more similar to a lion than a wolf. Others consider an escaped striped hyena, due to some sketches of the beast describing it as such. Another theory is that a large feral dog or wolfdog was responsible, since some sightings were of an animal that looked similar to a wolf, but was not one. In a 2021 talk by François-Louis Pelissier, based on the described appearance of the animal and specific details of behaviour and what can be inferred about historical distribution, he argued that beast encounters could most probably be blamed on the Italian wolf &quot;Canis&quot; &quot;lupus&quot; &quot;italicus&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (2001), directed by Christophe Gans, is an action film based on the legend. In the film, the Beast is a lion dressed up in armor to mask its identity.
* Netflix will make a feature film produced by Blumhouse Productions.
* &quot;The Cursed&quot;, a 2022 movie set in late-19th-century France, features the beast as a gypsy curse placed on a French village.
*In 2022, German power metal band Powerwolf released a single titled &quot;Bete de Gevaudan&quot;.
* MTV series &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; featured La Bete du Gévaudan as the primary antagonist in the second part of its fifth season, with the episode &#x27;Maid of Gevaudan&#x27; retelling the original legend. It was first mentioned in the season 1 episode &#x27;Magic Bullet&#x27; linking the legend to the Argent family, which is later explained in the fifth season.
* Patricia Briggs&#x27; novel &quot;Hunting Grounds&quot; the Beast of Gévaudan and Jean Chastel are one and the same. He is one of the most feared Alpha wolves in Europe.

<doc id="1215426" wikidata="Q3398728" url="?curid=1215426" title="Terrahawks">
<text>Terrahawks is a 1980s British science fiction television series created by Gerry Anderson and Christopher Burr for London Weekend Television. The series was Anderson&#x27;s first in over a decade to use puppets for its characters, and also his last. Anderson&#x27;s previous puppet-centric TV series included &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;.

Set in the year 2020, the series follows the adventures of the Terrahawks, a taskforce responsible for protecting Earth from invasion by a group of extraterrestrial androids led by Zelda. Like Anderson&#x27;s previous puppet series, futuristic vehicles and technology featured prominently in each episode.

==Premise==

The series is set in the year 2020, after an alien force has destroyed NASA&#x27;s Mars base and Earth is under threat. A small organisation, The Terrahawks, is set up to defend the planet. From Hawknest, their secret base in South America, they develop sophisticated weapons to prepare for the battles to come.

&quot;Terrahawks&quot; was less straight-laced than any of Anderson&#x27;s previous series, featuring a wry, tongue-in-cheek humour as well as dramatic jeopardy. The ensemble cast, with each member assigned a vehicle, had many similarities with Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, whilst the alien invasion plot was reminiscent of &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; and the live action &quot;UFO&quot;.

==History==
Prior to &quot;Terrahawks&quot; and throughout the entirety of the 1960s, Anderson&#x27;s series were noted for their use of his Supermarionation technique, which made use of electronically augmented marionettes (the final series to use this technique was the live action/Supermarionation hybrid &quot;The Secret Service&quot; in 1969; Anderson switched to live action production beginning with 1970&#x27;s &quot;UFO&quot;). In contrast, producers of &quot;Terrahawks&quot; made use of latex Muppet-style hand puppets to animate the characters, in a process Anderson dubbed &quot;Supermacromation&quot;.

This was partly dictated by the relatively low budget (latex hand puppets being much cheaper to produce than the sculpted wooden marionettes of previous series), but the absence of strings allowed for much smoother movement, and could be used to more easily produce the illusion of the puppets walking. The necessarily static puppets of previous series had been a source of frustration to Anderson during his Supermarionation days.

===Production===
Split into three series, &quot;Terrahawks&quot;″ 39 episodes were filmed between January 1983 and August 1984. The first 13 episodes were filmed on a budget of £3 million at Bray Studios with a crew of 65.

Tony Barwick, the series&#x27; most prolific scriptwriter, constantly used tongue-in-cheek aliases whenever he wrote a different episode, calling himself, for instance, &quot;Anne Teakstein,&quot; and &quot;Felix Catstein.&quot; (He was not alone in this; Donald James wrote the episodes &quot;From Here To Infinity&quot; and &quot;The Sporilla&quot; under the names &quot;Katz Stein&quot; and &quot;Leo Pardstein&quot; respectively.) The only episodes of the series &quot;not&quot; credited to pseudonyms ending in &quot;-stein&quot; are &quot;The Midas Touch,&quot; scripted by Trevor Lansdowne and Tony Barwick, the latter billed under his real name for the only time on the series, and the two-part opener &quot;Expect The Unexpected,&quot; written by Gerry Anderson.

A fourth series would have developed the characters of Kate&#x27;s producer Stewart Dapples and Kate Kestrel further. This was explained in a documentary on the special features disc of the series, in the Gerry Anderson book &quot;Supermarionation&quot; and the &quot;Terrahawks&quot; DVDs. Two of the scripts were called &quot;101 Seed&quot; (a parody of the title &quot;Number One Seed&quot;), written by Anderson himself (as &quot;Gerry Anderstein&quot;), and &quot;Attempted MOIDer&quot; by Tony Barwick (alias in this case D.I. Skeistein).

In the UK, six specially prepared compilations of &quot;Terrahawks&quot; were released on video cassette, covering 24 out of 26 episodes from the first series. The first tape contained a few scenes in the premiere episode that had been edited out of the broadcast master due to time constraints (those scenes are not on DVD). The final volume, &quot;Zero Strikes Back&quot;, had a smaller print run than the rest of the tapes, and was quite a collectors&#x27; item, with copies generally going for around £100 on eBay until the series began to be released on DVD. The series is available on DVD in the United Kingdom and North America. A Blu-ray release of the first series was released in June 2016.

Unlike virtually all of Gerry Anderson&#x27;s other puppet-based series, &quot;Terrahawks&quot; was not produced by ITC Entertainment. This meant that after &quot;Terrahawks&quot; repeats disappeared from UK airwaves in the late 1980s and the six compilation video tapes went out of production, the series was noticeably hard to find compared to Anderson&#x27;s other series, most of which received a renaissance throughout the 1990s.

===Title sequence and end credits===
The opening and closing sequences were created using hand-drawn cel animation to imitate computer graphics. The opening title sequence begins with a video game playing on a screen when Doctor &quot;Tiger&quot; Ninestein appears and says: &quot;Terrahawks! Stay on this channel! This is an emergency!&quot;. The end credits, the Zeroid and Cube robots would often &quot;play&quot; noughts and crosses with each other, resulting in a different winner each week (the Cubes usually had to cheat and steal a Zeroid&#x27;s position in order to win). The exception to this was the episode &quot;A Christmas Miracle&quot;, which featured the song &quot;I Believe in Christmas&quot; as sung by Kate Kestrel played over a still of a Zeroid.

The original opening title sequence was used for both the United States and the UK versions of the series, but a different version of the end credits was produced for the US variant, featuring a Zeroid bouncing up and down next to one of Zelda&#x27;s Cubes as a &quot;Kate Kestrel&quot; song plays. At the conclusion of the credits the Zeroid jumps off of the screen and crashes back down onto the Cube.

When the series was purchased for airing in Japan, the title and ending credits were augmented by an all-new anime-style sequence, the first highlighting the Terrahawks craft and the Zeroids, and the ending credits showcasing a lonesome spacesuited female remembering her life on Earth as Spacehawk flies over her. The songs used in these sequences are and , respectively, by The Lillies Naomi and Mayumi Tsubame.

===Music===
Without the lavish budgets of his earlier television series, it was apparent to Gerry Anderson from a very early stage of production that it would not be possible to record full orchestral scores for &quot;Terrahawks&quot;. However, the development of synthesised music had advanced considerably since the early days of the experimental &#x27;electromusic&#x27; composed and recorded by Barry Gray for &quot;Supercar&quot; and &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, and by 1983 it was possible to create electronic music that could at least approach the scale and majesty of a full orchestra, but at a fraction of the cost.

Richard Harvey was introduced to Anderson by a mutual friend, music producer Tony Prior, who has previously suggested Derek Wadsworth as composer of the music for &quot;&quot; Year Two. A graduate of the Royal College of Music with a background in ancient and classical music, Harvey had worked extensively with film composer Maurice Jarre in the late 1970s. This experience made him the ideal choice to compose the music for &quot;Terrahawks&quot;, combining his knowledge of the structure of classical orchestral music with the latest synthesised music reproduction techniques. Anderson and his business partner Christoper Burr had regular meetings with Harvey to discuss the style of music that they wanted for &quot;Terrahawks&quot;, particularly the main theme which was envisaged as a combination of the &#x27;best bits&#x27; of the themes to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;.

In 2002, Fanderson records released a soundtrack compiling 75 minutes worth of music, the album included 3 of Harvey&#x27;s Demo Themes for the show, 6 full episode scores and 3 surviving Kate Kestrel songs, &quot;S.O.S&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; and the latter half of &quot;Living in the 21st Century&quot; which was used as the End Titles music in the U.S. syndication run. The remaining songs and first half of &quot;Living in the 21st Century&quot; are currently missing, presumed destroyed.


==Audio revival==
It was announced on 19 April 2014 that &quot;Terrahawks&quot; would be returning as a run of full cast audio dramas featuring original cast members. The new audio series were produced by Anderson Entertainment in association with Big Finish Productions. The first new series was released in April 2015, and consists of eight episodes. Ann Ridler who played Kate Kestrel and Cy-Star was replaced by Beth Chalmers, as Ridler had since died, and Windsor Davies who played Sergeant Major Zero was replaced by Jeremy Hitchen, as Davies had retired from acting.

A second series was released by Big Finish Productions in April 2016, and a third in July 2017.

==Characters==

===The Terrahawks===
Terrahawks (technically, the Earth Defence Squadron) is an elite task force that protects Earth from alien invasion.
* Doctor &quot;Tiger&quot; Ninestein (real first name unknown): Terrahawk&#x27;s pilot and the team&#x27;s leader, so named as he is the ninth clone created by Dr. Gerhard Stein. Somewhat bloodthirsty, his first reaction to alien contact is often to blast it out of the sky. In between alien attacks, he is often seen trying (and failing) to beat the high score of 750 points on his favourite video game. Ninestein&#x27;s catchphrases are &quot;Expect the unexpected&quot;, &quot;I have a theory...&quot; and, when frustrated, he often cries, &quot;Flaming thunderbolts!&quot; He also has a love-hate relationship with the Zeroids, particularly Sergeant Major Zero, and tends to push around Hawkeye. If he is killed, he can be replaced within 24 hours by another of the nine clones; his nickname of &quot;Tiger&quot; comes from the myth of cats similarly having &quot;nine lives&quot;. Tiger&#x27;s voice was provided by Jeremy Hitchen, who claimed he provided that voice in somewhat of an imitation of Jack Nicholson.
* Captain Mary Falconer: Battlehawk&#x27;s pilot. She acts as Ninestein&#x27;s second-in-command, weighing his offensive tendencies with her own regard for the value of life, whether in regards to one of Zelda&#x27;s henchmen, or to the Zeroids. She was voiced by Denise Bryer. Bryer used her normal voice for the role, unlike many of her other famous roles where she normally tended to use a &quot;clucking&quot; tone more typical of the voice of the character &quot;Zelda&quot; from &quot;Terrahawks,&quot; whom Bryer also voiced.
* Captain Kate Kestrel (real name: Katherine Westley): The pilot of the Hawkwing fighter aircraft and number three in Terrahawks&#x27; chain of command. Kate is also an internationally famous pop singer. Her record company is &quot;Anderburr Records&quot; – a portmanteau of &quot;Anderson&quot; and &quot;Burr.&quot; Her colleagues at the record company (producer Stewart Dapples - going by the name Stew, which was a play on the phrase &quot;Stewed Apples&quot; and studio manager Chic King) have absolutely no idea she also works for Terrahawks, and she often disappears on a mission partway through a recording session. She was voiced by Anne Ridler when speaking; Moya Griffiths (now Moya Ruskin) provided her singing voice. Beth Chalmers provides the voice of Kate in the audio productions, due to Ridler&#x27;s death in 2011.
* Lieutenant Hawkeye (real name: Hedley Howard Henderson III): Hawkwing&#x27;s gunner. Due to a track-and-field accident, his eyes have been replaced with micro-computers that enhance his targeting abilities. When given an order, he always replies &quot;aye-aye&quot; as a pun on his name. He is number four in the Terrahawks chain of command. Hawkeye&#x27;s voice was provided by Jeremy Hitchen.
* Lieutenant Hiro (full name unknown): The commander of Spacehawk, Hiro keeps a large collection of flowers to which he gives names and reads poetry. As number five in Terrahawks&#x27; chain of command, his thick Japanese accent is sometimes a source of humour. Like Ninestein, Hiro was voiced by Jeremy Hitchen.
* Zeroids: Spherical robots that perform ground operations and serve as the firepower for the Spacehawk. There are two leaders among the Zeroids who exhibit human-like capacity for thought and emotion, much to the mechanophobic Ninestein&#x27;s annoyance, who believes they should be unthinking, unfeeling machines that blindly follow orders; Sergeant Major Zero (voiced by Windsor Davies in a characterisation not dissimilar from his portrayal of Sergeant Major Williams in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;), commands the Zeroids stationed on Earth, while Space Sergeant 101 (voiced by Ben Stevens) directs the Zeroids stationed aboard Spacehawk; 101 and Zero often have arguments over command of Spacehawk. Other Zeroids are given distinct personality traits of their own, such as the Zeroid Dix-Huit, whose name is French for his number, eighteen, and who speaks French and has a handlebar moustache, 55, who bobs up and down in rhyme, 21, who has a stutter, and 66, who has a very thick Scottish accent. These accents irk Dr. Ninestein to the point he demanded they all be re-voiced in &quot;The Gun&quot;, only for Zero to get back at him by giving them all his own voice. They can increase their mass (becoming as heavy as a black hole), which allows them to perform devastating body-crash manoeuvres. This is often accompanied by a cry of &quot;St-&quot;roll&quot; on!&quot; Sergeant Major Zero, for his part, as he launched into action, often gave the war cry of &quot;GERONIMO!!!&quot; Unlike the other cast members, Windsor Davies usually only voiced Sergeant Major Zero and The Sporilla (although in a couple of episodes he also provided the voice of another Zeroid, Dr. Killjoy), and in the Big Finish audio series the role of Zero was taken over by Jeremy Hitchen.
* Colonel Johnson (first name unknown): The head of WASA (World Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration). Though he is ostensibly Terrahawks&#x27; co-director, in reality, Ninestein constantly overrides his authority. Jeremy Hitchen provided Colonel Johnson&#x27;s voice, as well as those of Hiro and Ninestein.

====Terrahawks vehicles====
* Terrahawk – A flying command centre, which can detach from the main body of the Battlehawk. This is Dr. Ninestein&#x27;s personal ship which he can be seen in the Pilot seat and Terrahawk is 95 feet long.
* Battlehawk – A heavy-duty carrier aircraft which transports the Zeroids, the Megazoid-manned Battletank for heavy support, and other auxiliary equipment. Battlehawk is 265 feet long and is part of Terrahawk, Battlehawk is the Proclaimed Flag of the Terrahawks.
* Hawkwing – A fighter aircraft with a separate over-wing, which can be released to act as a flying impact bomb. Hawkwing has a body of 70 feet and a wing span of 100 feet.
* Treehawk – A single-stage-to-orbit spaceship which transports personnel, such as Lieutenant Hiro, to the Spacehawk. Treehawk is also 80 feet long and flies into a part of space hawk for entry and exit.
* Spacehawk – An orbital battle station, customarily manned by Lieutenant Hiro, that provides the first line of defence against an attack. Spacehawk is 1600 feet in diameter and has a giant laser that can come out of the base.
* Overlander – A three-segment land vehicle used for transporting goods. In all of its appearances, it has been hijacked and subsequently destroyed.
* Battletank – A tank manned by a pair of Megazoids, usually used for major combat operations. It is transported by the Battlehawk, and is dropped out of its bay onto the ground.
* Spacetank – A tank designed for operations in a vacuum. It only appeared in one episode, manned by Zero and Dix Huit.
* Hudson – Ninestein&#x27;s Rolls-Royce of indeterminate model, equipped with artificial intelligence and the ability to change its color. Ninestein is particularly fond of it, although Kate seems to use it the most.
* Hawklet – A small two seater space craft that is stationed in Spacehawk&#x27;s hangar bay. It appears only in the episodes &quot;First Strike&quot; and &quot;Jolly Roger One&quot;.
* MEV – A space craft stationed aboard Spacehawk. It is outfitted with tread tracks for traversing terrain, and a grappling arm fitted with a cannon.
* Groundhawk – A bomb disposal and demolition vehicle that appears only in the episodes &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; and &quot;Space Giant&quot;.

===Aliens===

Robots (&quot;androids&quot;) from the planet Guk rebelled when their creators and masters deteriorated into a state of apathy. Zelda and company are modelled after the oldest and wisest citizens of their planet, explaining their grey hair and wrinkled skin. Zelda hopes to conquer Earth and make it a home for her Family of Androids and NONE-Human Beings.
They need to consume only small amounts of silicate minerals a month to sustain their functions.
* Zelda. The main villain of the series, Zelda is the wicked and scheming would-be conqueror of Earth. She has power over matter, mainly used to teleport her servants to and from Earth and to manipulate the size of any of her ships or aliens. &quot;Zelda reclaims her own,&quot; Dr. Ninestein frequently says whenever Zelda teleports a defeated minion back to the Mars base. She was created as a bodyguard for Prince Zegar of Guk, but her inherently programmed ambition led to a revolt by herself and her fellow androids. She is known for referring to humans as &quot;Earth-scum&quot;, &quot;Earth-pukes&quot; and &quot;Earth-Wretches&quot;. She believes the humans are evil and that she is there to deliver the universe from their evil, destructive ways. Her voice was provided by Denise Bryer.
* Cy-star, pronounced &quot;Si-ster.&quot; Zelda&#x27;s &quot;daughter&quot; is not very bright, but is endlessly bubbly and optimistic. Frequently she gets so excited her hair slides around her head, leading Zelda to shout, in one episode, &quot;One of these days I&#x27;m going to nail that to your skull!&quot; She gives birth to It-star around the start of the third series. Her catchphrase is, &quot;&quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot; and &quot;WONNNNNNDERFUL!&quot;&quot; Her voice was provided on television by Anne Ridler and on audio by Beth Chalmers.
* Yung-Star. Zelda&#x27;s &quot;son,&quot; Yung-Star is lazy, greedy, cowardly, and only slightly more intelligent than his &quot;sister&quot; – he mistakes the term &quot;nincompoop&quot; for a compliment. However, despite or because of receiving the brunt of Zelda&#x27;s abuse, he sometimes shows initiative and is far more curious about his surroundings, qualifying him to be occasionally sent to accompany a monster. His catchphrase, uttered slowly in a revolting guttural voice, was &quot;Great Steaming Lava!&quot; Strangely enough, although an android, Yung-Star is partial to bowls of &quot;granite crunchies&quot; – rocks in a slimy green goo; he consumes these frequently, leading Zelda to call him gluttonous since, as stated, the Guk androids need only to consume small amounts of silicate minerals to sustain their functions. He was voiced by Ben Stevens.
* It-Star is also known as &quot;Goybirl&quot; or &quot;Birlgoy,&quot; since Cy-Star never decided on what gender this construct would be. It-Star is a &quot;baby&quot; android mothered by Cy-Star near the end of the series. It-Star is a clearly a hermaphrodite with two minds and voices, a young girl&#x27;s voice when &quot;innocent,&quot; and a male voice with a German accent when plotting. His plotting personality is highly vicious and clever, compared to the childish, infant-like one, earning his &quot;grandmother&#x27;s&quot; respect. The female voice was done by Denise Bryer while the male voice was by Jeremy Hitchen.
* Cubes are the aliens&#x27; answer to the Zeroids. They can combine into large constructs such as guns and force field cubicles. Their different sides are marked differently, indicating their different functions, such as one serving as a gun. Cy-Star keeps one, Pluto, as a pet.

====Zelda&#x27;s monsters====
Zelda possesses a collection of monstrous servants, Outcasts from various worlds or civilizations, who she keeps in cryogenic storage until needed.
* Sram is a reptilian beast with a devastating roar, capable of shattering mountains and destroying Hawkwing&#x27;s shots before they can get close enough to hit him. His blood gives off fumes that are highly toxic to human beings. In his first appearance Sram is quite articulate, but he does not speak in any further appearances. Sram appears in &quot;Thunder-Roar,&quot; &quot;Thunder Path,&quot; as Zelda&#x27;s drummer in &quot;Play it Again, Sram&quot;, a member of Zelda&#x27;s war party in &quot;First Strike&quot;, and a hallucination of him is seen in &quot;Mind Monster&quot;. He also makes a brief cameo in the audio episode &quot;The Prisoner of Zelda&quot;.
* The Sporilla is a savagely powerful beast that Zelda controls with a signalling device. After the device is destroyed, however, the Terrahawks find that the Sporilla is capable of halting speech and has no desire to fight them. Appears in &quot;The Sporilla.&quot; In &quot;Space Giant,&quot; another Sporilla appears. The Sporilla is a 7-foot tall metal-eating space gorilla (SPace gORILLA), covered in an off-white fur, a black gorilla face with horns and fangs. An imaginary Sporilla appears in &quot;Mind Monster&quot;, while another (real) Sporilla is Cystar&#x27;s co-pilot in &quot;My Enemy&#x27;s Enemy&quot;.
* MOID: The Master Of Infinite Disguise. He is a skeleton-like alien with almost non-existent facial features, and endowed with the capacity to assume the physical appearance of anyone. &quot;I wear many faces, but have none of my own,&quot; he once said to describe himself. The Terrahawks seem to find him pitiable, and he seems to regret living a life of servitude to Zelda. Despite working for her, he is also unwilling to take anyone&#x27;s life. Appears in &quot;Happy Madeday,&quot; &quot;Unseen Menace,&quot; and briefly in &quot;Play it Again, Sram&quot; as Mozart before returning in the audio episode &quot;The Prisoner of Zelda&quot;, where his origins are finally explored. He seems to have feelings for Kate Kestrel. A hallucination of him is seen in &quot;Mind Monster.&quot;
* Yuri is a teddy bear-like creature the aliens find hideous and frightening. He possesses the power to mentally control metal (his name appears to be a reference to Uri Geller, who claims to have similar powers in real life.) Zelda sometimes refers to him as &quot;the furry Napoleon.&quot; He appears in &quot;The Ugliest Monster of All,&quot; &quot;Operation SAS,&quot; &quot;Terratomb,&quot; and as a member of Zelda&#x27;s war party in &quot;First Strike.&quot; He returned in the audio episode &quot;Living Legend&quot;.
* Lord Tempo. The master of time, Tempo can travel back and forth in time at will, and alter its flow locally. Lord Tempo appears in &quot;My Kingdom for a ZEAF!&quot;, &quot;Time Warp&quot;, &quot;Timesplit&quot;, and as a member of Zelda&#x27;s war party in &quot;First Strike&quot;.
* Tamura the space Samurai is a good and honourable alien with a powerful space cruiser, the &quot;Ishimo&quot;. He intervenes in the dispute between Zelda and the Terrahawks with the aim of resolving the dispute. He is duped by Zelda who plans to double-cross him in order to destroy the Terrahawks. He finds out in time and Zelda&#x27;s plan fails. He refers to Hiro is his &quot;kindred spirit&quot;. He appears in the episode &quot;Space Samurai&quot;.
* The Krell is a hairy creature with an eyestalk that can fire a laser beam powerful enough to shoot down objects in orbit. It appears only in &quot;The Midas Touch&quot;.
* Cyclops is a black and red crawling creature with one giant eye. The cyclops absorbs metal. It appears only in &quot;Space Cyclops&quot;.
* Captain Goat is a space buccaneer who captained a pirate radio ship. He appears in &quot;Jolly Roger One&quot; and &quot;Set Sail for Misadventure&quot;.
* Cold Finger is an alien who is an expert at weaponising water and ice. His entire ship was made of ice. He only appears in Cold Finger.

===Audio-only characters===

Characters who only appear in the Big Finish audio series include;
* Lois Price is a NASA operative who was sent to Hawknest to investigate the necessity of the continued funding of the Terrahawks project. She also became unintentionally involved in a plot by her commanding officer to eliminate the Terrahawks and later went behind her superiors&#x27; backs to give Ninestein command of the X-99 fleet. Voiced by Beth Chalmers, she appears in &quot;The Price is Right&quot;, &quot;Chain of Command&quot;, &quot;My Enemy&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, &quot;Set Sail for Misadventure&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Enemies, Negotiation and Deceit&quot;. Her name is a pun: &quot;Lowest price&quot;.
* Zeroid 35 is an inexperienced and overenthusiastic female Zeroid with a crush on Sergeant Major Zero. Originally posted to Spacehawk, she was later transferred to Hawknest after her bravery during the Watchdog affair. Voiced by Beth Chalmers, she appears in &quot;Return to Sender&quot;, &quot;Renta-hawks&quot;, &quot;My Enemy&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, &quot;No Second Chances&quot;, &quot;Living Legend&quot;, and &quot;The Prisoner of Zelda&quot;.

<doc id="1215436" wikidata="Q3482688" url="?curid=1215436" title="Shuttered Room">
<text>Shuttered Room is the debut studio album by the British band the Fixx, released on 14 May 1982.

It contains the group&#x27;s debut single (in the United States), &quot;Stand or Fall&quot;, which hit the Top 10 of Billboard&#x27;s Album Rock Tracks as well as No. 79 on the Hot 100. Its follow-up US single was &quot;Red Skies&quot;, although this was their debut single in the UK market. Both songs were aided by popular MTV music videos.

==Track listing==
&quot;Shuttered Room&quot; has been released in a number of different configurations. Though the front cover artwork remains consistent across the releases, the tracks, track order, and even the credits can vary from release to release.

===Original UK track listing (MCA Records FX 1001)===
The UK version differs from the US (and later CD) release in a number of respects, including the fact that all the songs are credited to Curnin/West-Oram/Woods/Greenall/Barrett, with lyrics attributed to Cy Curnin only.

;Side 1
#&quot;Some People&quot; – 3:01
#&quot;Stand or Fall&quot; – 4:00
#&quot;Cameras in Paris&quot; – 3:52
#&quot;Shuttered Room&quot; – 2:47
#&quot;The Fool&quot; – 5:21

;Side 2
#&quot;Lost Planes&quot; – 3:23
#&quot;I Live&quot; – 4:53
#&quot;Sinking Island&quot; – 3:16
#&quot;Time in a Glass&quot; – 3:32
#&quot;Red Skies&quot; – 4:20

===US track listing===
On the US LP version, &quot;Sinking Island&quot; and &quot; Time In A Glass&quot; are dropped; &quot;I Found You&quot; and &quot;The Strain&quot; are added; and the track order is resequenced. All songs are credited as being written by Charlie Barrett, Cy Curnin, Rupert Greenall, and Jamie West-Oram, except where noted.

;Side 1
#&quot;I Found You&quot; – 3:38
#&quot;Some People&quot; – 3:00
#&quot;Stand or Fall&quot; – 4:00
#&quot;The Strain&quot; – 3:33
#&quot;Red Skies&quot; – 4:19

;Side 2
#&quot;Lost Planes&quot; – 3:20
#&quot;Cameras in Paris&quot; – 3:57
#&quot;I Live&quot; – 4:52
#&quot;Shuttered Room&quot; – 2:46
#&quot;The Fool&quot; – 5:20

The CD version adds two tracks, (including &quot;Sinking Island&quot;, although this is the &#x27;Special Extended Dance Mix&#x27; originally released as the B-side on the &quot;Red Skies&quot; 12&quot; single):
#&quot;Sinking Island&quot; [*] – 4:33
#&quot;Stand or Fall&quot; (Extended Mix) [*] – 4:48

===1996 European CD reissue (Repertoire REP 4598-WY)===
The 1996 European CD compiles all the tracks from the various issues onto one CD.

#&quot;Sinking Island&quot; – 4:32
#&quot;I Found You&quot; – 3:38
#&quot;Some People&quot; – 3:00
#&quot;Stand or Fall&quot; – 4:00
#&quot;Red Skies&quot; – 4:20
#&quot;Lost Planes&quot; – 3:20
#&quot;Cameras in Paris&quot; – 3:57
#&quot;I Live&quot; – 4:53
#&quot;Shuttered Room&quot; – 2:46
#&quot;The Fool&quot; – 5:21
#&quot;Time in a Glass&quot; – 3:27

<text>The Death Gate Cycle is a seven-part series (heptalogy) of fantasy novels written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. The main conflict is between two powerful races, the Sartan and the Patryns, which branched off from humans following a nuclear/anti-matter holocaust. Centuries prior to the events of the series, the Sartan attempted to end the conflict by sundering the Earth into four elemental realms, and imprisoning the Patryns in a fifth prison world, the Labyrinth. The Sartan took up stewardship of the elemental realms, but soon mysteriously lost contact with each other and disappeared. Centuries later, a Patryn known as Xar escaped the Labyrinth, and started returning to the Labyrinth to rescue others. He learned how to access the other worlds, using the eponymous portal called the Death Gate, and dreamed of freeing all his people from the Labyrinth and conquering the other worlds. The books follow the fiercely independent Haplo, a Patryn agent sent to scout the elemental worlds and throw them into chaos in preparation for his Lord&#x27;s conquest of them. Weis and Hickman created five distinct fantasy worlds during the course of the series, along with developing the cultures of five major races: the unique Patryn and Sartan, and the common fantasy races of dwarves, elves, and humans.

==Behind the series==
:&quot;Margaret and I have always tried to take fantasy literature in new directions. Krynn is a world wholly distinct from Earth, unlike Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. Time travel itself was a science-fiction notion we applied to fantasy. We have even written fantasies taking place in the far future (The Death Gate Cycle)!&quot;
::— Tracy Hickman, &quot;The Annotated Dragonlance Legends&quot; pg. 458

Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman had finished their Dragonlance and Darksword series prior to &quot;The Death Gate Cycle&quot;, which may be considered their most ambitious work yet, as they created multiple fully realized and distinct worlds. The series also displayed Weis and Hickman&#x27;s continued command of the fantasy genre.

As in their previous works, the authors continued to explore the theme of balance, and how the universe naturally works to correct imbalances.

Unlike in &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, where the universe&#x27;s balance was a greater force than even the gods, the existence of a god or gods in &quot;The Death Gate Cycle&quot; is unknown; a universal balance is the closest thing to divinity. Along a similar line, the authors continued to explore the theme of men becoming gods—in this case with the entire Patryn and Sartan races clamoring for that throne. Finally, as in both &quot;Dragonlance&quot; and the &quot;Darksword&quot; series, they explored the effects of sweeping changes to the fundamental nature of a world (in this case worlds) on both the day-to-day life and the fate of nations.

Similar to the central concept of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which J. R. R. Tolkien claimed was a translation of a real tome in his keeping (the Red Book of Westmarch), &quot;The Death Gate Cycle&quot; claims to be documentation of the events revolving around Death&#x27;s Gate, authored after the fact by its primary characters. Even more than that, it is a &quot;scholarly&quot; document, with footnotes containing definitions of terms, references to past adventures and authorial asides. Each novel contains appendices giving further detail on various aspects of the story and its world, often summarizing (or occasionally laying the groundwork for) information related in the narrative proper. Finally, most of the novels also contain a musical score at the end, documenting a song (or sometimes a Sartan music-based rune-construct) featured in that particular volume.

==Worlds in the series==
:&quot;The Earth was destroyed.&quot;
:&quot;Four worlds were created out of the ruin. Worlds for ourselves and the mensch: Air, Fire, Stone, Water.&quot;
:&quot;Four Gates connect each world to the other: Arianus to Pryan to Abarrach to Chelestra.&quot;
:&quot;A house of correction was built for our enemies: the Labyrinth.&quot;
:&quot;The Labyrinth is connected to the other worlds through the Fifth Gate: the Nexus.&quot;
:&quot;The Sixth Gate is the center, permitting entry: the Vortex.&quot;
:&quot;And all was accomplished through the Seventh Gate.&quot;
:&quot;The end was the beginning.&quot;
::— Weis &amp; Hickman, &quot;Into The Labyrinth&quot; pg. 9

===Earth===
Before the main timeline of the series, life on Earth was nearly wiped out. Humans unleashed a nuclear war that killed millions, leaving the survivors struggling in the Age of Dust. Elves and dwarves, who had gone into hiding during the Renaissance, also suffered from what the humans had wrought with their science. In this chaos, a mutant strain of humans emerged who were once again able to feel the Wave—that which maintains balance and order in the universe. Recognizing its potential for magic, they developed runes to harness it. Originally, there was only one group, the Sartan. The &quot;Sartan&quot; used magic by drawing runes on the ground and in the air, augmented by singing and spoken word; they believed that their power gave them responsibility and stewardship over the lesser races, whom they called &quot;mensch&quot;. The Sartan believed in community, unity, and family, the basis of Order. However, in their conceit, they forgot about the Wave&#x27;s tendency to balance everything. As the Sartan became too powerful, the Wave shifted and the Patryns came to be. Unlike the &quot;Sartan&quot;, the &quot;Patryns&quot; were loners, volatile and destructive; they believed that their powers gave them the right to do as they would. Patryns tattooed the runes on themselves and chose their name to mock the Sartan (see Languages below). These two races came into conflict over control and influence of the mensch. Both came to think of themselves as gods, though the Sartan believed themselves to be the &quot;good guys&quot;.

Eventually the Sartan, led by Samah and his Council of Seven, and driven by their own fear, undertook drastic measures. They broke the planet Earth into four separate worlds, each one focusing on a separate element (air, earth, fire, and water). This cataclysmic moment of destruction and re-creation is known as the Sundering. Millions of mensch died, with only chosen populations magically isolated for resettlement. The Patryns were captured and imprisoned in the Labyrinth which the Sartan created for their &quot;rehabilitation&quot;. The Vortex (or the Sixth Gate) was the entry point to the Labyrinth, where the mensch were temporarily housed during the Sundering itself and where the captured Patryns were eventually placed. The books later reveal that certain members of the Sartan population had objected to The Sundering; these too were consigned to the Vortex and the Labyrinth. In the center of the Labyrinth was the Nexus, a paradise city for the Patryns to live in once they had become &quot;civilized.&quot; The Nexus, the Labyrinth, and the Vortex are arranged in concentric circles. All of these worlds are connected by Death&#x27;s Gate, and smaller, one-way gates called Conduits which allow each elemental world to transmit materials to one another.

The Sartan were left in stewardship of not just one world, but many, all designed to work in perfect harmony. The Plan of the Council of Seven was the grand construction of interconnected worlds, each with a specific function that fed into the whole. Almost immediately, however, things began to go wrong.

===Chelestra, the world of water===
Chelestra was to be the primary world where the mensch and Sartan would live. A great orb of liquid, the world was populated by great drifting beasts used as habitats for the mensch, with its own &quot;Seasun&quot; at the center. An appendix for Serpent Mage describes this liquid as not actually water, but a fluid which can be breathed through lungs and gills. Chelestra was also intended as a tremendous waste management and recycling plant, with the great floating habitat-beasts called &quot;durnai&quot; serving as biological recycling stations for the detritus from the other worlds. However, strange serpents, creatures of great power and corruption - that the Sartan had not created - began to appear. The Sartan could not account for their existence, but their danger was undeniable. Even worse, the emulsion fluid of Chelestra had a neutralizing effect on Sartan rune magic, rendering it and them utterly powerless. Surrounded by water that took away their power, no longer in control of the mensch, and faced with the serpents, the Sartan of Chelestra retreated into their capital. Samah, fearing what would happen if the serpents spread to the other worlds, shut Death&#x27;s Gate, cutting communication between the worlds. The Sartan then placed themselves into a stasis sleep, expecting it to only last long enough for the other worlds to finish their parts of the grand plan and come help. This contributed to the disappearance of the Sartan from the mensch worlds, setting up the main series&#x27; events.

===Arianus, the world of air===
On Arianus, intended as an industrial and manufacturing world of floating continents, the Sartan had other problems. Cut off from communication with the other worlds (Chelestra specifically and the Council), the Sartan were slowly dying of some unknown cause, quickly becoming vastly outnumbered by the mensch. These Sartan also settled into hibernation, hoping for help from the other worlds. The Kicksey-winsey, a grand machine intended to align the floating continents and provide them with water (water being a direct byproduct of its production cycle), as well as manufacture all the processed goods desired by the other worlds, never became properly active. The dwarves, known on this world as Gegs, not truly understanding its purpose, effectively became slaves to the machine, worshiping it after a fashion as an artifact of their gods, the Mangers, (known to others as the Sartans) who had placed them there as its caretakers. The elves became tyrannical lords of much of the mid-realm through manipulation of the dwarves to obtain a monopoly on water, whilst constantly waging war with the humans.

===Pryan, the world of fire===
Pryan was created as a great inverted globe with four small suns at its center. It was to be the power plant and center for all four worlds, but it too fell into chaos. Great Citadels collected the energy from Pryan&#x27;s four suns and beamed it through conduits to the other three worlds (the Colossi on Abarrach, the Kicksey-winsey on Arianus and the seasun on Chelestra). Covered entirely by miles-thick jungle (only the dwarves had ever seen the legendary &#x27;ground&#x27;) the Citadels were to be the bastions of civilization, where the Mensch would live a life of plenty and comfort. However, as with the other worlds, the Sartan mysteriously began to die. In fear, some citadels banished the mensch to the jungle. The Tytans, great blind giants of immense power created by the Sartan to manage the power systems of the citadels, were also banished because of fear they could no longer be controlled by the remaining Sartan. The Tytans went on to be an unstoppable terror as they searched for the citadels, trying to get home.

===Abarrach, the world of stone===
Finally, and most desperately, Abarrach was a huge volcanic asteroid-like world. The Sartan and mensch lived inside its honeycombed tunnels—designed to provide minerals and metals to the Kicksey-winsey—but they turned out to be loaded with poisonous volcanic fumes. The mensch were wiped out swiftly—the dwarves hung on the longest—and the poisons taxed the magic of the remaining Sartan to create breathable air. Huge columns called Colossi had been created by the Sartan to provide light and keep the world warm in the long run, but they began to fail almost immediately (because they did not receive the necessary energy from Pryan).

With all the mensch dead and Sartan magic stretched to the limit, the Sartan of Abarrach turned to the forbidden arts of necromancy, using the corpses of the dead to supplement a lost workforce. While at the start it seemed a logical (if desperate) move that would help, it proved to be the most critical and tragic mistake of the whole Sartan race, as the dead eventually escaped from Sartan control. But the use of necromancy had an even worse result, one far more disastrous for the Sartan: For every life brought back, every soul prevented from passing on, another life ends untimely. For each dead body resurrected, another member of the species, somewhere, dies. The continuous restoration of dead Sartan on Abarrach resulted in the mass deaths among the Sartan populations of other worlds. Only on Chelestra, apparently due to either the Barrier protecting the Sartan city, or the properties of the water itself, did the Sartan survive relatively unscathed.

===The Labyrinth===
In the Labyrinth, the Sartan who should have been monitoring the prison realm either died or left. And without its caretakers, the Labyrinth slowly evolved from a temporary correctional facility into a sadistic and sentient prison. Instead of forcing a hard existence upon the Patryns and teaching them to care for others through relying on one another, it created a lethal, murderous hell where survival was the cruel torture of having hope dangled in your face, only to have it ripped away. Setting out on journeys that lasted generations, the Patryns traveled and fought in nomadic bands or simply alone. They became even more warlike as they fought against incredible odds to push farther and farther towards escape. Though some Patryns did eventually escape, they did so only by climbing on the corpses of those who had come before.

====Plans of conquest====
In the end the plan was a total collapse. All of the Sartan on Pryan and Arianus mysteriously died, save one. With no one left to go to their aid, the Sartan on Chelestra (unknowingly protected by their shield, and possibly the nullifying water) never awoke. Abarrach was a pale, dying shadow. In the meantime, the mensch lost all knowledge of their past; the lost Sartan of Arianus and Pryan became mythical god figures to the dwarves, elves and humans of those worlds. This left the imprisoned Patryns as the only ones who still remembered some of their heritage.

After uncounted generations of struggle, Lord Xar became the first Patryn to escape from the Labyrinth. (He was not the first to escape, however. The books later reveal that Zifnab, a Sartan who had been cast into the Labyrinth for challenging the Sundering, apparently reached the Nexus well before him.) There, Lord Xar discovered a wealth of books (written by Zifnab in the Sartan language) that detailed events preceding and following the Sundering. From these, he devised a way to partially open Death&#x27;s Gate and send through an emissary. Haplo, Lord Xar&#x27;s favored servant, becomes this emissary; his two missions are to learn what has happened to the Sartan, and to subtly generate chaos among the mensch so that Lord Xar can come and &quot;save&quot; them. It is Xar&#x27;s intention to rule all the four worlds, and Haplo is his willing servant.

==Races in the series==
:&quot;Some years ago, I was working on a fantasy series called Death Gate with Margaret Weis. We needed two competing systems of magic that made sense. I remembered a saying of my old friend, Jeff Grubb. He defined quantum physics as &quot;figures, figures, figures, figures, figures ... and then God does something ... figures, figures, figures, figures, figures.&quot; So, in order to create a believable pair of magic systems, I researched what amounted to Newtonian versus Quantum mechanics and, later, competing visions of quantum theory. I read popular science books regarding Relativity, quantum mechanics, Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, parallel universes and chaos theory. The results were a wonderful and sensible pair of magic systems that made sense because they were modeled on quantum and chaos theories.&quot;
::— Tracy Hickman, &quot;Hickman Newsletter #115&quot;

Drawing on these inspirations, Weis and Hickman set up the Patryns and Sartan as opposing pairs in many respects including the magical, and they portrayed the &quot;mensch&quot; races as having lesser (or no) magical abilities. The highest level of magic takes the form of this Patryn and Sartan &quot;rune magic,&quot; which alters reality based on possibility and whose operation is influenced by the aforementioned theories. The elves and humans use &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; magic of less potency, that operates directly on the world around it.

===Patryns===
Patryns are represented as having the same height and build as humans, but the current generations of the series are all in excellent physical shape due to the hardships of the Labyrinth. They are born with brown hair that turns white from the tips up. They are all possessed of excellent magical ability to varying degrees, also a necessity for their survival. All Patryns are capable of using rune magic, which manipulates the Wave of possibilities, allowing Patryns to view a myriad of possible outcomes and select one to occur. The more unlikely the possibility, however, the more difficult to conjure. Patryn use of runes is portrayed as less elegant than Sartan, as it relies more on physical representations such as their tattoos, the use of voice, and drawing the runes in air or on a surface. Patryn runes complement Sartan runes, and can sometimes be used to accomplish the same tasks. Patryns also tend to be loners, but are intensely passionate due to the hardships of the Labyrinth. They will aid one another without question, but generally put their own survival above that of others. Patryns who form groups tend to follow a single ruler, such as the Headman of tribes in the Labyrinth and Xar of the liberated Patryns.

===Sartan===
Sartan are also of the same height and build as humans, but unlike the Patryns, they have not been hardened by generations of violent life. Also unlike the Patryns they are born with white hair that turns brown from the tips up. All Sartan are capable of using rune magic. The Sartan use of runes is portrayed as more elegant than the Patryn, involving singing and dancing in prescribed tones and movements to affect the Wave. In some instances, Sartan inscribe runes, mainly to permanently enchant an object or location, such as when creating barred gateways or magical weapons that can then be used by mensch. Sartan runes complement Patryn runes, and can be used to accomplish the same tasks. Sartan tend to act as a community, making decisions as a group rather than as individuals, and they generally have a ruling Council. The Sartan on Abarrach, however, were more fractured due to their hardships. They are presented in contrast to other Sartan as having less magical talent, using much of their strength to survive.

===Mensch races===

====Humans====
The humans of the series are standard &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and are not presented as distinct parallels to existing modern-day nationalities. &quot;Dark-skinned&quot; humans populate Chelestra, while both dark-skinned and fair-skinned humans populate Arianus and Pryan. Humans are of standard height and physical prowess, and a small subset possess magical capability. Human magic is considered part of the Spiritual Masteries, tending towards &quot;the emotional and mental manipulation of the world about the magician.&quot; A human of sufficient magical talent can perform a variety of feats, including the manipulation of the elements, creating illusions, healing, compelling other life-forms, transforming shape and size, translocation and overcoming physical limitations such as gravity. While some magicians can mentally construct their magic rather than speaking it, most need to use physical gestures and in some instances physical objects or incantations to perform their magic. The spiritual nature of human magic also ties in with the theme of balance present throughout the series. Humans, especially when compared to elves, are &quot;lacking&quot; in their connection to the natural world and spirituality and their magical skills serve to balance this deficit.

====Elves====
Elves are generally taller and more slender than humans and have a greatly extended lifespan. Their longer lives tend to breed a lack of urgency in their outlook, sometimes problematic in dealings with the comparatively impatient humans. Elven magic is considered part of the Physical Masteries, which &quot;tend to use and make use of physical objects in the world about the wizard.&quot; For instance, this allows for the creation of &quot;smart&quot; self-targeting arrows, flying dragonships, magical submarines, protective charms against human magics, fabric as hard as steel and other mechanical devices with enhanced capabilities. As with human magic, elven magic is used to balance the elven deficiencies in mechanical, physical, and technical fields. They can also weave magical messages into songs. Elves must both speak and gesture to cast their magic, and the magic contained in songs can be triggered by anyone capable of singing it since the magic is not dependent on a wizard, thus making it possible for humans to trigger elven magic in this form. In Dragon Wing, this explains how humans have been able to use songs to trigger a nostalgia so intense that the elves of Arianus have formed an open rebellion against their ruler.

In contrast, the Kenkari, an isolated group of powerful elven magi on Arianus, also employ a very specialised form of magic based on the spirit which allows them to communicate with the souls of others, living or dead and on one occasion have been shown to change their forms into their order&#x27;s symbol; the butterfly, which is a glaring exception to the mechanical focus. However, this can possibly be explained by their use of song in these communications, as well as their use of a special box to transport souls and a cathedral designed to contain the captured souls.

====Dwarves====
Dwarves are short and stocky compared to the other races, such that humans and elves would have to go down on one knee to converse with a dwarf eye-to-eye. In fact, doing so is considered a mark of respect towards a dwarf. As is typical in portrayals of dwarves, they prefer to live in dark, underground areas, and they also possess an innate sense of direction superior to that of humans or elves. Dwarves have no magical abilities of their own, although certain dwarves of Pryan make very rudimentary use of Sartan magic through triggering its representations in songs and runes carved onto amulets. On Arianus, they are known as &quot;Gegs&quot;. On Abarrach, they were known as the Little People, and were the only mensch race durable enough to survive in the harsh conditions of Abarrach for a while.

==Zifnab and related characters==
The character Zifnab is similar to the character Fizban from Weis and Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels. Zifnab makes a few references to Fizban during the series (when he&#x27;s asked for his name he said &quot;Fiz..., no can&#x27;t use that one&quot;, or such as the importance of a Wizard&#x27;s Hat) and he is described with a similar appearance. He makes references to the Pern series of books, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, James Bond, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, Arthurian legend, the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, and soul music; within the context of the books, these are historic references to the former Earth. The character type appears again in a similar capacity in the &quot;Starshield&quot; novels, where the parallel character is known as Zanfib.

Are Zifnab and Fizban the same person?
The simplest (and legal) answer, in Hickman&#x27;s own words, is always:
&quot;The answer is that Fizban is a crazed wizard owned by TSR under copyright, while Zifnab is a completely different crazed wizard owned by Margaret and I. Incidentally, neither Fizban nor Zifnab have any relationship whatsoever to Zanfib—a crazed wizard from our Starshield series. I hope I have cleared this up once and for all.&quot;

As to the actual nature of Zifnab within the world of the Death Gate Cycle, Hickman wrote: &quot;Zifnab was actually a Sartan wizard who opposed the council&#x27;s decision to sunder the world. Zifnab is not a god ... indeed, he is actually a chosen and blessed subject of the dragon-avatars of the Death Gate series.&quot;

So why does Zifnab seem, at times, to act just like Fizban? How can he remember Tanis and Raistlin, and why does he nearly call himself Fizban? Hickman: &quot;I like to think that Zifnab is very well read.&quot; And so, as far as we know, that is all there is to it: the crazy old wizard was a fan of Dragonlance, as well as, apparently, Tolkien and James Bond. The rest is purely speculation.

Hickman has said that the Zifnab/Fizban/Zanfib character is like him in that they are similarly misunderstood and possessed of great depth, and so the character type continues appearing in his works with Weis. On multiple occasions, Hickman has jokingly suggested that the three characters are distinctly different because they are separately owned and appear in separate series.

&quot;Zifnab,&quot; &quot;Fizban,&quot; and &quot;Zanfib&quot; are anagrams.

==Language usage==
The name &quot;Haplo&quot; is said to mean &quot;single&quot; in the Patryn language, and &quot;haplo-&quot; is a Greek root word with the same meaning. Haplo and Marit&#x27;s daughter is named &quot;Rue&quot;, which in English is a verb meaning regret.

The term &quot;mensch&quot; is used by both Sartan and Patryns to refer to humans, elves, and dwarves, both collectively (all three races) and individually (one particular mensch person). Mensch is the German word for &quot;human,&quot; but it is used in the books as a derogatory term.

The names &quot;Sartan&quot; and &quot;Patryn&quot; are defined in the books as &quot;Those Who Bring Back Light,&quot; and &quot;Those Who Return to Darkness&quot; respectively.

A footnote suggests that the Lord of the Nexus took the name &quot;Xar&quot; from the Russian word &quot;tsar&quot;, which itself is a corruption of &quot;Caesar&quot;.

The Patryn city of Abri takes its name from the French word for &quot;shelter&quot;.

==Game adaptations==
Legend Entertainment released a computer adventure game called Death Gate based on the series. The game is based roughly on the first four books, although at the end it also contains an interpretation of the final confrontation from &quot;The Seventh Gate.&quot;

<text>Hunt Emerson (born 1952) is an English cartoonist. He was closely involved with the Birmingham Arts Lab of the mid-to-late 1970s, and with the British underground comics scene of the 1970s and 1980s. His many comic strips and graphic novels have been translated into numerous languages.

==Biography==
His earliest strips in the 1970s appeared in such British small press comics as &quot;Graphixus&quot;, &quot;Brainstorm Comix&quot;, &quot;Moon Comix&quot;, &quot;Yikes&quot;, &quot;Animal Bite Comix&quot;, &quot;No Ducks&quot;, &quot;Phobos&quot;, &quot;Streetcomix&quot;, &quot;Free Comix&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Fish&quot;.

A trip to the US put Emerson in touch with the underground comix publisher Rip Off Press, which published his &quot;Thunderdogs&quot; title; while Don and Maggie Thompson included him in their mini-comic series, for which he created &quot;Calculus Cat&quot;. Emerson&#x27;s art also appeared in the US underground/alternative anthologies &quot;Commies from Mars&quot; and &quot;Eclipse Monthly&quot;. &quot;Dogman&quot;, and &quot;Large Cow Comix&quot; (a five issue series with separate subtitles) were all Emerson work cover to cover, but it was &quot;Knockabout Comics&quot;, a British comic book-sized, and later album-sized, anthology that featured some of Emerson&#x27;s most notable strips, including the characters Alan Rabbit, Calculus Cat, Max Zillion &amp; Alto Ego, Pusspuss, Momo and Fuzi, Charlie Chirp, plus the one-shot stories &quot;Cakes And Bricks,&quot; &quot;The Dentist,&quot; and &quot;Mouth City&quot;. The latter two stories spawned a series called &quot;Citymouth&quot;, and later a collected volume.

==Works==
Square-bound books written by others, such as &quot;You Are Maggie Thatcher&quot; and &quot;Hard To Swallow&quot;, showcase Emerson strips and illustrations throughout. In &quot;Outrageous Tales From the Old Testament&quot; he tackled a version of the Book of Leviticus written by Alan Moore, and in &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, depicted &quot;Envy&quot;. For the DC Comics imprint Factoid Books, in the 1990s, he did biographical comics on everything from Erich von Stroheim to Prince Charles and Princess Diana. These appeared in &quot;The Big Book Of&quot; series. For dozens of issues of the British underground &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, he created &quot;Arsover Tit&quot;.

The Emerson graphic novels &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; and other adaptations of classic novels and tales have been sold in numerous countries, and translated into several different languages.

For over 30 years Hunt Emerson&#x27;s strips and illustrations have graced the pages of &quot;Fortean Times&quot;, a magazine of occult and unexplained phenomena, while his pornographically humorous Firkin the Cat (written by Tym Manley) has appeared in hundreds of &quot;Fiesta&quot; magazines.

He drew the cover design for Terry McCann&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Stand Back It&#x27;s Rent-a-Crowd&quot;. He designed the &#x27;Beat Girl&#x27; icon for Birmingham band The Beat. and painted a mural of the band, which was used as cover art for the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Wha&#x27;ppen?&quot;.

In 2016, he designed the Walsall Silver Thread Tapestries.
Emerson drew and created &quot;Ratz&quot; for &quot;The Beano&quot;, a strip about mean rats in a sewer. In 2002–2007, he drew Little Plum for that comic. In March 2009, he revived the &quot;Fred&#x27;s Bed&quot; strip.

==Politics==
In a 2019 interview, the anarchist cartoonist Donald Rooum described himself as an admirer of Emerson, having taken out a subscription to the &quot;Fortean Times&quot; purely to read his work. More explicitly, a &quot;New Politics&quot; article identified Emerson as a fellow anarchist cartoonist alongside Rooum, among others. Emerson had previously exhibited work at the British Library show &quot;Comics Unmasked: Art and Anarchy in the UK&quot;, and would later contribute work to an exhibition about the Victorian radical John Ruskin. Emerson himself has described ignoring high politics, instead choosing to focus on community-based work. He has also said that explicitly political work of his, such as a Titan Books publication with Pat Mills about Margaret Thatcher, have become dated too quickly as politics moves on.

<doc id="1215475" wikidata="Q299704" url="?curid=1215475" title="Sherry Lansing">
<text>Sherry Lansing (born Sherry Lee Duhl; July 31, 1944) is an American former film studio executive serving as chairwoman of Universal Music Group&#x27;s board of directors since 2023. She previously served as chairwoman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, and president of production at 20th Century Fox prior to her retirement. From 1999 to 2022, she was on the University of California Board of Regents. 

In 2005, she became the first female film studio head to place hand and footprints at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater. In 2001, she was named one of the 30 most powerful women in the US by &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; named her number 1 on its Power 100 list numerous times.

== Early life and education ==
Lansing was born Sherry Lee Duhl in Chicago, Illinois, to Margaret Heimann and real estate investor David Duhl. Her mother fled from Nazi Germany in 1937, at the age of 17. After her father died when Lansing was nine, her mother remarried Norton S. Lansing.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlSherry Lansing: from making movies to curing cancer / UCLA Today&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in a Jewish household.

Lansing attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and graduated in 1962. In 1966, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree at Northwestern University and graduated cum laude. She was a member of Sigma Delta Tau sorority.

== About ==

=== Career ===

==== Acting ====
Lansing briefly dabbled in acting, appearing as Susan in the 1970 rom-com “Loving,” starring Eva-Marie Saint and George Segal, and co-starring Sterling Hayden. Also in 1970, Lansing played Amelita in Academy Award Winning Director Howard Hawks’ last film “Rio Lobo,” starring John Wayne, and co-starring Jorge Rivero and Jennifer O’Neill. Lansing also appeared in several television shows and documentaries about films, and the actors, and actresses, starring in them. Dissatisfied with her own acting skills, she decided to learn more about the film industry from the ground up.

==== Production ====
Lansing took a job with MGM as head script reader. She then became VP of Production at Columbia Pictures and oversaw two highly-successful films, &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, both released in 1979. Her work at Columbia Pictures eventually led to an appointment with 20th Century Fox in 1980, at age 35, as the first female production president of a major studio. She resigned in December 1982 and became a partner with Stanley R. Jaffe (with whom she shares a birthday) to form Jaffe-Lansing Productions based at Paramount Pictures. The company released a consistent string of minor hits through Paramount before achieving box-office success with &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; in 1987, for which Jaffe and Lansing received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture the following year.

The partnership also produced &quot;The Accused&quot; (1988) starring Jodie Foster, about rape and its impact on a victim&#x27;s life. The film featured a graphic rape scene and was highly controversial when released. Made with a small budget of $6 million, it grossed over $37 million worldwide, becoming a box office hit.

Other Jaffe-Lansing productions include &quot;Black Rain&quot; (1989), starring Michael Douglas, Andy Garcia, and Ken Takakura, as well as &quot;School Ties&quot; (1992), starring Brendan Fraser. On her own, Lansing produced the very successful &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; (1993), starring Robert Redford, Demi Moore, and Woody Harrelson.
==== Chairman of Paramount ====
In 1992, Lansing was offered the chairmanship of Paramount Pictures&#x27; Motion Picture Group. During her tenure at Paramount, the studio enjoyed its longest and most successful string of releases since the 1930s. Under Lansing, the studio produced such hits as &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, and what was, at the time, history&#x27;s highest-grossing film – &quot;Titanic&quot; (the latter two during a partnership with 20th Century Fox). 

Viacom (which purchased Paramount in 1994) split the company into two parts in 2004 and Lansing stepped down at the end of that year after an almost unprecedented twelve-year tenure atop Hollywood&#x27;s legendary &quot;Best Show in Town.&quot;

She served as a Regent of the University of California from 1999–2022, and as chairman of the board from 2011–2013. She sits on the boards of the Broad Museum, The Carter Center, the Entertainment Industry Foundation, The W.M. Keck Foundation, the Lasker Foundation, the Pacific Council on International Policy, and Scripps Research. In 2007, she founded the EnCorps STEM Teachers Program, on whose board she serves as chair. She is also co-founder of the Stand Up To Cancer initiative, which funds research teams bringing cancer treatments to patients faster.

==== Chairman of Universal Music Group Board of Directors ====
Lansing was named Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Universal Music Group in 2023.

==== Philanthropy ====
In 2005, she created the Sherry Lansing Foundation, which is dedicated to raising awareness and funds for cancer research, K-12 public education, and encore career opportunities. She is a recipient of UCLA Anderson School of Management&#x27;s highest honor-the Exemplary Leadership in Management (ELM) Award.

In 2007, she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her work in cancer research at the 79th Academy Awards.

In 2011, Lansing pledged $5 million to University of Chicago Laboratory Schools to build a new arts wing, including a 250-seat performance venue.

In March 2020, she hosted a fundraiser for Joe Biden at her home.

== Personal life ==
Lansing married fellow student Michael Brownstein in 1967 while attending Northwestern University. They divorced in 1970. She was married to director William Friedkin from 1991 until his death in 2023.

Lansing and former MGM studio head James T. Aubrey were struck by a car while crossing Wilshire Boulevard in 1978. Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches for a year and a half.

<text>Kenneth Bruce McFarlane, FBA (18 October 1903 – 16 July 1966) was one of the 20th century&#x27;s most influential historians of late medieval England. 

==Life==
McFarlane was born on 18 October 1903, the only child of A. McFarlane, OBE. His father was a civil servant in the Admiralty and the young McFarlane&#x27;s childhood was an unhappy one. This may have led to the deep melancholy that seemed to pervade much of his adult life. His family sent him to public school at Dulwich College as a day-boy. McFarlane did not particularly like the atmosphere of the public school. In 1922 he earned a scholarship to read history at Exeter College, Oxford. His tutor during these years was C. T. Atkinson. Following the completion of his DPhil on the loans of Cardinal Beaufort to the English Crown (September 1927), McFarlane became a fellow of Magdalen College, where he remained for the rest of his life. 

Many of McFarlane&#x27;s colleagues and students found him difficult to approach, but to those who could break through the facade he became a true friend. McFarlane also found, through the help of his great friend Helena Wright and her family, a home and a family of sorts. In Wright&#x27;s house he found that he could be himself and find refuge from the daily grind of the University and a place of joy. McFarlane never married.

His most important contribution to the field was his revision of the understanding of late medieval feudal relationships, known as &quot;bastard feudalism&quot;. The old consensus, promoted primarily by Bishop Stubbs, was that payment for service in feudal relationships had promoted greed and civil strife. McFarlane, however, pointed out the adhesive effect of such a system, and other forms of patronage, as a field of common interest for the Crown and the landed aristocracy. According to Christine Carpenter in &quot;Wars of the Roses – Politics and the constitution in England c. 1473–1509&quot; (Cambridge University Press 1997): &quot;It is hard to exaggerate the impact of McFarlane&#x27;s work, especially at Oxford where he taught. A whole generation of students there was inspired to work on what had been a very neglected century; nearly all the political historians of fourteenth and fifteenth century England today, including the present writer, are, academically speaking, the children or grandchildren, even great grandchildren, of McFarlane.&quot; She also described him as being responsible for a &quot;paradigm shift&quot;. In more recent debate, it has been pointed out that McFarlane created a &quot;paradoxical metaphor – the image of a polluted, dirty, as it were contaminated phenomenon – of the feudalism&quot; which led to follow-up terms as it was a late-medieval &quot;bastard urbanism&quot; (a term invented by 19th century historians to characterize feudalism as it took form in the Late Middle Ages, foremost in England).

In July 1966, while house-hunting before retirement, McFarlane was &quot;ambushed by a stroke which killed him instantly&quot;.

==Publications==
Although his scholarship and methods have had great influence on later historians, McFarlane did not publish widely in his lifetime. A. N. Wilson said of McFarlane that &quot;he knew more about the late Middle Ages than anyone alive, but could not translate any of his knowledge into books&quot;. The main sources for his scholarship are the book &quot;Lancastrian Kings and Lollard Knights&quot;, published in 1972, his Ford Lectures from 1953, published in 1980 as &quot;The Nobility of Later Medieval England&quot;, and the essays and shorter articles published by his student G. L. Harriss in 1981 under the title &quot;England in the Fifteenth Century&quot;. Much of his influence on historiography is the result of his DPhil students, who held posts in many British universities. In 1952 he had contributed &quot;John Wycliffe and the Beginnings of English Non-conformity&quot; to the &quot;Teach Yourself History&quot; series.

&quot;Letters to Friends, 1940–1966&quot;, edited by G. L. Harriss, contains a selection from the large collection of correspondence deposited with Magdalen College and published privately through the college in 1997. The great bulk of McFarlane&#x27;s correspondence remains unpublished.

<doc id="1215484" wikidata="Q157087" url="?curid=1215484" title="Four Hills Tournament">
<text>The Four Hills Tournament () or the German-Austrian Ski Jumping Week () is a ski jumping event composed of four World Cup events and has taken place in Germany and Austria each year since 1953. With few exceptions, it has consisted of the ski jumping events held at Oberstdorf, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Innsbruck and Bischofshofen, in this order.

The Four Hills Tournament champion is the one who gets the most points over the four events. Unlike the World Cup ranking, however, the actual points scored during the competitions are the ones that are used to determine the winner. In 2005–06, Janne Ahonen and Jakub Janda shared the overall victory after finishing with exactly the same points total after the four competitions. In 2001–02, the anniversary 50th edition, Sven Hannawald was the first to achieve the &quot;grand slam&quot; of ski jumping, winning all four events in the same edition. In 2017–18 season Kamil Stoch became the second ski jumper in history to obtain this achievement, and just a year later, in the 2018–19 edition, Ryōyū Kobayashi became the third.

The four individual events themselves are part of the World Cup and award points toward the world cup in exactly the same manner as all other world cup events.

== Tournament hills ==
Traditionally, the order of the tournament competitions has been: Oberstdorf, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Innsbruck, Bischofshofen – with the following exceptions:
:*1953: Garmisch-Partenkirchen was the first, and Oberstdorf the second event.
:*1956–57, 1961–62, 1962–63: Innsbruck was the second event, and Garmisch-Partenkirchen third.
:*1971–72: Innsbruck was first, and Oberstdorf third.
:*2007–08, 2021–22: The Innsbruck event was cancelled due to bad weather, and replaced with an additional competition at Bischofshofen.

==Knock-out system==

One of the tournament&#x27;s peculiarities is its qualifying system. Unlike other ski jumping events where the best 30 competitors in the first round qualify for the second round, all Four Hills events follow a knock-out system first introduced for the 1996–97 season.

The 50 competitors are divided into 25 pairs. All 25 winners of these duels plus the five best losers qualify for the second round. It is theoretically possible that a competitor who finishes the first round 12th will not qualify for the second round (if he loses his internal duel, five lucky losers and winners of their duels have better results) while the one with the 49th first series result may still qualify (if his &quot;rival&quot; has the worst result). On the other hand, jumpers are less likely to be disadvantaged by a possible significant change in weather conditions between the start and end of the first series. A change in the direction and speed of the wind can make it impossible for the best jumpers to produce a good result. In the event of significantly worse conditions during the second half of the first series, the possibility exists that most of the best jumpers would be eliminated by bad luck alone. Directly pairing rivals reduces the impact of these conditions. In this competition format the qualifying series are valued as well, since jumpers with a better qualification result will have the opportunity to compete against jumpers with worse result. Therefore, it is not enough for a jumper to be among 50 best jumpers in qualifications (with whatever result), but it is better for him to achieve a result as good as possible.

The first jumper in the competition is the one who qualified 26th, followed by his pair who qualified 25th. The next pair has 27th and 24th from the qualification, one after that 28th and 23rd etc. The last pair has last qualified jumper against qualification winner.

If qualification is postponed until the day of competition, the knock-out system is not used, and competition follows regular world cup rules. Because of that in the 2007/08 tournament, the knock-out system was used only in Oberstdorf.

== List of winners ==

;Notes
== Records ==
Janne Ahonen is the only ski jumper to have won the tournament five times, with wins in 1998–99, 2002–03, 2004–05, 2005–06 and 2007–08. Jens Weißflog was the first ski jumper to reach four wins, winning the tournament in 1984, 1985, 1991 and 1996. Helmut Recknagel, Bjørn Wirkola, Kamil Stoch and Ryōyū Kobayashi have the third best record, winning three titles each. Wirkola&#x27;s victories came in three consecutive years (1967–1969), a record still uncontested.

Janne Ahonen&#x27;s fourth victory in 2005–06 was also the first time the tournament victory was shared, with Jakub Janda, who claimed his first Four Hills Tournament crown.

Jens Weißflog and Bjørn Wirkola have both won ten Four Hills Tournament events. Janne Ahonen and Gregor Schlierenzauer are next with nine victories, followed by Ryōyū Kobayashi with eight.

In 2000–01, the 49th edition of the tournament, Adam Małysz beat second placed Janne Ahonen by 104.4 points. This is the biggest winning margin in the tournament&#x27;s history. He also won all four qualifications that year. The following year Sven Hannawald became the first person to win all four competitions in a single season. In 2017-18 Kamil Stoch has repeated Hannawald&#x27;s record and year after, Ryōyū Kobayashi became the third person to win all four events.

Austria currently holds the record for the number of overall victories (with seventeen). Two nations each have sixteen victories: Finland and Germany (including nine victories earned by ski jumpers from East Germany, four – from West Germany and three – from unified German team). Fourth is Norway with eleven victories. Poland has five victories, Japan has four victories. Czechoslovakia and one of its successors the Czech Republic have two victories altogether, as have Slovenia. Soviet Union has a single victory.

===Overall winners===
==National quota==
During the Four Hills Tournament many national jumpers from Germany and Austria are allowed to qualify for the competition. This allows them to show themselves and get experience. The national jumping team starts first in the qualification.

==Notable participants==
In 1965, the Polish jumper, Stanisław Marusarz (silver medal in World Championship, 1938 in Lahti) who was visiting the tournament, asked the jury in Garmisch-Partenkirchen to allow him a showcase jump. After a long debate, the jury agreed. Marusarz, who at this time was 53 years old (and not practicing jumping for nine years) achieved 66 meters, using borrowed skies and boots and making his jump in an official suit (in which he attended the New Years Party), which made the crowd applaud.

<doc id="1215494" wikidata="Q2289513" url="?curid=1215494" title="S phase">
<text>S phase (Synthesis phase) is the phase of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated, occurring between G1 phase and G2 phase. Since accurate duplication of the genome is critical to successful cell division, the processes that occur during S-phase are tightly regulated and widely conserved.

==Regulation==

Entry into S-phase is controlled by the G1 restriction point (R), which commits cells to the remainder of the cell-cycle if there is adequate nutrients and growth signaling. This transition is essentially irreversible; after passing the restriction point, the cell will progress through S-phase even if environmental conditions become unfavorable.

Accordingly, entry into S-phase is controlled by molecular pathways that facilitate a rapid, unidirectional shift in cell state. In yeast, for instance, cell growth induces accumulation of Cln3 cyclin, which complexes with the cyclin dependent kinase CDK2. The Cln3-CDK2 complex promotes transcription of S-phase genes by inactivating the transcriptional repressor Whi5. Since upregulation of S-phase genes drive further suppression of Whi5, this pathway creates a positive feedback loop that fully commits cells to S-phase gene expression.

A remarkably similar regulatory scheme exists in mammalian cells. Mitogenic signals received throughout G1-phase cause gradual accumulation of cyclin D, which complexes with CDK4/6. Active cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex induces release of E2F transcription factor, which in turn initiates expression of S-phase genes. Several E2F target genes promote further release of E2F, creating a positive feedback loop similar to the one found in yeast.

==DNA replication==

Throughout M phase and G1 phase, cells assemble inactive pre-replication complexes (pre-RC) on replication origins distributed throughout the genome. During S-phase, the cell converts pre-RCs into active replication forks to initiate DNA replication. This process depends on the kinase activity of Cdc7 and various S-phase CDKs, both of which are upregulated upon S-phase entry.

Activation of the pre-RC is a closely regulated and highly sequential process. After Cdc7 and S-phase CDKs phosphorylate their respective substrates, a second set of replicative factors associate with the pre-RC. Stable association encourages MCM helicase to unwind a small stretch of parental DNA into two strands of ssDNA, which in turn recruits replication protein A (RPA), an ssDNA binding protein. RPA recruitment primes the replication fork for loading of replicative DNA polymerases and PCNA sliding clamps. Loading of these factors completes the active replication fork and initiates synthesis of new DNA.

Complete replication fork assembly and activation only occurs on a small subset of replication origins. All eukaryotes possess many more replication origins than strictly needed during one cycle of DNA replication. Redundant origins may increase the flexibility of DNA replication, allowing cells to control the rate of DNA synthesis and respond to replication stress.

== Histone synthesis ==
Since new DNA must be packaged into nucleosomes to function properly, synthesis of canonical (non-variant) histone proteins occurs alongside DNA replication. During early S-phase, the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex phosphorylates NPAT, a nuclear coactivator of histone transcription. NPAT is activated by phosphorylation and recruits the Tip60 chromatin remodeling complex to the promoters of histone genes. Tip60 activity removes inhibitory chromatin structures and drives a three to ten-fold increase in transcription rate.

In addition to increasing transcription of histone genes, S-phase entry also regulates histone production at the RNA level. Instead of polyadenylated tails, canonical histone transcripts possess a conserved 3` stem loop motif that selective binds to Stem Loop Binding Protein (SLBP). SLBP binding is required for efficient processing, export, and translation of histone mRNAs, allowing it to function as a highly sensitive biochemical &quot;switch&quot;. During S-phase, accumulation of SLBP acts together with NPAT to drastically increase the efficiency of histone production. However, once S-phase ends, both SLBP and bound RNA are rapidly degraded. This immediately halts histone production and prevents a toxic buildup of free histones.

== Nucleosome replication ==

Free histones produced by the cell during S-phase are rapidly incorporated into new nucleosomes. This process is closely tied to the replication fork, occurring immediately in “front” and “behind” the replication complex. Translocation of MCM helicase along the leading strand disrupts parental nucleosome octamers, resulting in the release of H3-H4 and H2A-H2B subunits. Reassembly of nucleosomes behind the replication fork is mediated by chromatin assembly factors (CAFs) that are loosely associated with replication proteins. Though not fully understood, the reassembly does not appear to utilize the semi-conservative scheme seen in DNA replication. Labeling experiments indicate that nucleosome duplication is predominantly conservative. The paternal H3-H4 core nucleosome remains completely segregated from newly synthesized H3-H4, resulting in the formation of nucleosomes that either contain exclusively old H3-H4 or exclusively new H3-H4. “Old” and “new” histones are assigned to each daughter strand semi-randomly, resulting in equal division of regulatory modifications.

== Reestablishment of chromatin domains ==
Immediately after division, each daughter chromatid only possesses half the epigenetic modifications present in the paternal chromatid. The cell must use this partial set of instructions to re-establish functional chromatin domains before entering mitosis.

For large genomic regions, inheritance of old H3-H4 nucleosomes is sufficient for accurate re-establishment of chromatin domains. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and several other histone-modifying complexes can &quot;copy&quot; modifications present on old histones onto new histones. This process amplifies epigenetic marks and counters the dilutive effect of nucleosome duplication.

However, for small domains approaching the size of individual genes, old nucleosomes are spread too thinly for accurate propagation of histone modifications. In these regions, chromatin structure is probably controlled by incorporation of histone variants during nucleosome reassembly. The close correlation seen between H3.3/H2A.Z and transcriptionally active regions lends support to this proposed mechanism. Unfortunately, a causal relationship has yet to be proven.

== DNA damage checkpoints ==
During S-phase, the cell continuously scrutinizes its genome for abnormalities. Detection of DNA damage induces activation of three canonical S-phase &quot;checkpoint pathways&quot; that delay or arrest further cell cycle progression:

# The &quot;Replication Checkpoint&quot; detects stalled replication forks by integrating signals from RPA, ATR Interacting Protein (ATRIP), and RAD17. Upon activation, the replication checkpoint upregulates nucleotide biosynthesis and blocks replication initiation from unfired origins. Both of these processes contribute to rescue of stalled forks by increasing the availability of dNTPs.
# The &quot;S-M Checkpoint&quot; blocks mitosis until the entire genome has been successfully duplicated. This pathway induces arrest by inhibiting the Cyclin-B-CDK1 complex, which gradually accumulates throughout the cell cycle to promote mitotic entry.
# The &quot;intra-S Phase Checkpoint&quot; detects Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) through activation of ATR and ATM kinases. In addition to facilitating DNA repair, active ATR and ATM stalls cell cycle progression by promoting degradation of CDC25A, a phosphatase that removes inhibitory phosphate residues from CDKs. Homologous recombination, an accurate process for repairing DNA double-strand breaks, is most active in S phase, declines in G2/M and is nearly absent in G1 phase.

In addition to these canonical checkpoints, recent evidence suggests that abnormalities in histone supply and nucleosome assembly can also alter S-phase progression. Depletion of free histones in &quot;Drosophila&quot; cells dramatically prolongs S-phase and causes permanent arrest in G2-phase. This unique arrest phenotype is not associated with activation of canonical DNA damage pathways, indicating that nucleosome assembly and histone supply may be scrutinized by a novel S-phase checkpoint.

<text>Qadura Fares () is a Palestinian politician. He was a Palestinian Authority minister without portfolio under Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei from 2003 to 2005, and a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council for Fatah from 1996 to 2006. He is a close friend, aide and adviser to senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. Fares is regarded as one of the principal architects of Fatah&#x27;s &#x27;young guard&#x27; movement, who briefly formed the al-Mustaqbal or &quot;Future&quot; list (2005) before joining with Mahmoud Abbas to form a united Fatah list for the upcoming elections.

Fares was not nominated in the united list for the 2006 elections, and ran unsuccessfully as an independent in the Ramallah district. Also, since at least 2011, Fares has been consistently referred to as the &quot;head&quot; of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, so it is unclear exactly what position Fares actually holds as he is not listed as either the President nor the Executive Director of the club, positions clearly identified with other individuals.

In 2003, he was appointed Minister of State for the Affairs of Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission.

<doc id="1215513" wikidata="Q7337573" url="?curid=1215513" title="River Leen">
<text>The River Leen is a 15-mile (24 km) long tributary of the River Trent that flows through Nottinghamshire, and the city of Nottingham in the East Midlands of England.

The name Leen developed through various renderings of the Celtic word meaning &quot;lake&quot; or &quot;pool&quot; (&quot;Llyn&quot; in modern Welsh). Some of the surrounding villages derived their name from the River Leen. Lenton, &quot;ton&quot; being the Saxon word for &quot;village&quot;; and Linby, &quot;by&quot; being the Danish equivalent of &quot;ton.&quot;

==Course==
The Leen rises as a series of springs at the foot of the Robin Hood Hills just outside Annesley. It then flows through the grounds and lakes of Newstead Abbey, passing Papplewick and meeting the Whyburn as it passes through Bestwood Country Park, following the route of the Leen Valley into suburban and urban Nottingham. Within the city it flows through the centre of Bulwell, and passes Basford where it is joined by the Day Brook. The Leen then flows through Radford, and Lenton before passing under the Nottingham Canal and flowing on to join the River Trent next to Riverside Way in The Meadows.

==History==
From Lenton onwards the course of the Leen has been quite radically altered on a number of occasions, although the river&#x27;s present course probably follows a route close to its original natural course. The first change to the river&#x27;s course came in the late eleventh or early twelfth centuries, when the river was diverted to pass beneath the cliff on which Nottingham Castle was situated before flowing into the Trent near Trent Bridge, thus providing the town of Nottingham with a more plentiful supply of water. The next change came with the opening of the Nottingham Canal, which in some places occupied the course of the Leen, with the river being diverted along the route of the present Canal Street. This stretch was eventually culverted in 1863 by the Nottingham Borough Engineer, Marriott Ogle Tarbotton.

Further changes came with the construction of Castle Boulevard along the foot of the Castle cliff in 1884. With insufficient room for river, canal and road, the river was diverted into the canal at Lenton and the road built on the course of the former river. After flowing some distance along the canal, the river passed over a small weir into the Tinker’s Leen (where the modern Courts complex is now situated) and so into the Trent just downstream of Trent Bridge. However over time, and as the river&#x27;s catchment area became more built up with faster run-off times, flooding became a problem, with particularly heavy flooding in 1960. By this stage, the main line of the canal between Lenton and Langley Mill had been abandoned, although the stretch through Nottingham remains in use as part of the Trent navigation.

This flooding led to a further diversion, which would largely divert the river back to its original pre-eleventh-century course. The river was first diverted into the southernmost section of the abandoned canal, between Derby Road and the operational canal at Lenton. It was then taken under that canal in a syphon, before entering a brand new channel that took it to join the Trent at its nearest point.

==Mythology==
The River Leen, as alluded to by the location of its source, is frequently mentioned in the Robin Hood mythology, often cited as the river upon which Robin Hood and Little John fought their famous duel.

==Recent developments==
Nottingham City Council planning guidance and best practice from the Environment Agency is now to remove culverts, which are expensive to maintain and can cause flooding when they are blocked or damaged. As a result, a number of developments along the course of the Leen now open up previously culverted stretches of the waterway.

A new Tesco development in Bulwell town centre, which received planning permission in 2008, will remove the culvert under the former Kwik Save supermarket.

In Radford, a new student village at Chettle&#x27;s Yard will open up a long stretch of the river parallel to the railway line.

And the eastern part of the University of Nottingham&#x27;s Jubilee Campus opens up a section of the river&#x27;s urban route through Lenton, a small lake having been created to the rear of the Ingenuity Centre, adjacent to the concrete channel (through which the Leen still flows) that was originally built to prevent the flooding of the now-demolished Raleigh cycle factory. The river then passes through several industrial units and under Triumph Road, before re-appearing behind the Nottingham Emergency Medical Services centre (the old AA building) on Derby Road. The Leen is sometimes mistakenly believed to pass through the main part of the Jubilee Campus, but the lake and other water features in that area are artificial in nature.

<text>The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (CAA) was an omnibus appropriation legislation consisting of eleven Divisions, enacted on December 8, 2004, as H.R. 4818 by President Bush and assigned Public Law No. 108-447, during the 108th United States Congress. It approved appropriations of $388 billion for eleven departments, including &quot;foreign operations, export financing, related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, and for other purposes.&quot;

On Friday, November 19, it was announced that the United States government was in danger of running out of money by midnight that night.

Eager to adjourn for the year, the bill, drafted by the House in a late night session on Friday, November 19, 2004, became known for its last-minute budgeting. On Saturday, November 20, in order to put the FY 2005 (October 1, 2004 - September 30, 2005) appropriations bill to a close, the Senate had to quickly review the 3,016-page appropriations bill containing &quot;complex and controversial matters&quot; which included nine bills, only two of which had been debated in the Senate, and a conference report with 32 unrelated provisions that the Senate had never considered.

The bill was passed by the House in an emergency session on Saturday, November 20, even though members were not aware of the specific wording of the bill.

==Scope==

Among the spending cuts made were several of President Bush&#x27;s initiatives. These included funding to AmeriCorp, and a rejection of his plans to build up the United States nuclear weapons stores. The bill funded a dozen agencies including the Departments of Labor, Agriculture, Treasury, State and Justice. However, its most major change was to raise the debt limit of the Federal Government.

By Monday, November 21, the bill reached the Senate where it was revealed by Democratic Senator Kent Conrad that among the many overlooked provisions, the bill gave two committee chairmen, the chairmen of the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations, the ability to access anyone&#x27;s tax returns. In response, Rep. Ernest Istook of Oklahoma, who was in charge of this section of the bill, said the provision was intended to &quot;include visiting and inspecting the huge IRS processing centers but not inspecting tax returns.&quot; He also stated adamantly that there is no conspiracy. Opponents claimed this was evidence of a real problem in the legislative system and it must be required that bills must be reviewed in their entirety before they are passed. The Senate refused to send the bill to the president until the tax provision was changed or removed. It was decided that an already existing provision would fund the country until a minimalistic session was held on December 6 when the house would vote to remove the language. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said &quot;accountability will be carried out&quot; for whoever put the provision in.

Also, buried within the bill was a provision that stated doctors, hospitals, and clinics no longer have to offer abortion as an alternative to birth control undermining the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

By the middle of the following week, on November 24, more and more of the actual text of the bill was known. It included such provisions as $335,000 to protect North Dakota sunflowers from blackbirds, $2.3 million for an animal waste management research lab in Bowling Green, Kentucky, $50,000 to control wild hogs in Missouri, and $443,000 to develop salmon-fortified baby food, $131 million for abstinence programs in public schools, and most notably $350,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to develop music education programs.

Sen. Richard Shelby a Republican from Alabama and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, managed to win several dozen special items for his state, more than anyone else. However, many members of Congress, Republicans, and Democrats, stepped forward to defend special projects for their states that make up the bulk of the bill. Part of President Bush&#x27;s platform for re-election was to cut so-called &quot;congressional pet projects&quot; - also known as earmarks - and spend the government&#x27;s money on things that would help the country as a whole. President Bush signed the bill into law on December 6.Public Law No. 108-447 A 2004 &quot;New York Times&quot; article noted that with Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, earmarks made up approximately four percent of the $388 billion in the Bill.

<text>Hayden Schlossberg (born June 9, 1978) is an American screenwriter, director, and producer best known for his work on &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (with Jon Hurwitz and Josh Heald), the &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar&quot; films and &quot;American Reunion&quot; (with Hurwitz).

== Early life==
Schlossberg was born in New Jersey, to Jewish parents. Schlossberg met Jon Hurwitz when they both attended Randolph High School. After high school, Schlossberg attended the University of Chicago, where he studied history. Hurwitz went to the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School, with Josh Heald who lived in the same dorm with him during freshman year. Schlossberg frequently came to visit Hurwitz at Penn, and thus got to know him as well. Schlossberg graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in History in 2000. His original goal was to study law.

==Career==
It was during their time in college that Hurwitz and Schlossberg sold their first script &quot;Filthy&quot; to MGM. Upon selling &quot;Filthy&quot;, they moved to Hollywood to begin their career in the entertainment industry. The idea for the first &quot;Harold and Kumar&quot; film, &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot; developed while they were living in Los Angeles. Schlossberg and Hurwitz decided to write a low-budget stoner film and base the main characters on their high school friends from Randolph High School. They based the character of Harold on their real-life friend Harold Lee. Hurwitz got the idea to base the film around White Castle from his own experience craving White Castle burgers when he lived in Pennsylvania for several years. At the time, Pennsylvania did not have any White Castle locations and Hurwitz had to have family members bring him frozen White Castle burgers from New Jersey. It was later followed by &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; and &quot;A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas&quot;. They also wrote and directed the fourth theatrical entry in the &quot;American Pie&quot; franchise, &quot;American Reunion&quot; (2012).

They currently work on &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, a continuation of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; franchise. They created the show, along with their close friend Josh Heald. The trio serve as executive producers, show runners, writers, and directors on the series. More recently, he and his friend Jon Hurwitz, along with Josh Heald via Counterbalance Entertainment has signed a deal with Sony Pictures Television.

<text>The Wilson College, established in 1832 in Mumbai, is one of India&#x27;s oldest colleges; its foundation precedes that of the University of Mumbai, (to which it is affiliated), by 25 years. Wilson College was granted autonomy by Mumbai University in November 2021. It was awarded an A rating by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in 2005.

Located opposite Mumbai&#x27;s Girgaon Chowpatty, the college building was constructed in 1889 and designed by John Adams in the domestic Victorian Gothic style. It is listed as a Grade III heritage structure in the city. , the college offered a variety of subjects for both higher secondary and undergraduate students which include University Aided courses for the Arts and the Sciences as well as self-financed courses such as Mass Media, Information Technology, Management Studies, Biotechnology, Electronics &amp; Computer Science.

==History==

The Wilson College was founded by the Scottish missionary Rev. John Wilson, in 1832. Beginning as Ambroli English School in Girgaum, Mumbai, it later saw several changes of sites and names, eventually being called the Wilson School. The collegiate section, from which Wilson College evolved, came about in 1836.

Soon after their arrival in Mumbai in February 1829, Wilson and his wife Margaret Wilson began studying the local language of Marathi. Margaret started a school for girls in 1829 at Ambroli House in Girgaum at Mumbai, with Marathi being the chief medium of instruction and learning. An English boarding school was opened in 1832, which later became the St. Columba School. The Ambroli English School is the direct forerunner of the present college.

On 14 December 1861, the collegiate section of Wilson&#x27;s institution under the name of Free General Assembly&#x27;s Institution became the first privately owned, non-government institution to be affiliated to the university. In 1952, the management of the college came under an autonomous Board of Governors in India. Since 1963, the college functions under the management of John Wilson Education Society. Wilson College is a Christian minority institution and is closely related to CNI. It aims at education of the Christian community and extends its facilities and services to other communities too.

The students of Wilson College are from nearly every ethnic, religious and social group, of the country as well as of the world.

The motto of the college is &quot;Fides, Spes, Caritas&quot; (Vishwas, Asha, Prem) — Faith (in God), Hope (that the college can achieve the highest level of moral, spiritual and intellectual excellence, and love that steers one through life).

After the death of Dr. Wilson in 1875, Rev Dr Dugald Mackichan served as a successor, having already served the college for six months at the time of Wilson&#x27;s death. Nine years later, Mackichan became principal and held the position until 1920, becoming one of the most distinguished principals of the college. Mackichan, who taught physics and was instrumental for setting up the college&#x27;s physics laboratory, was a distinguished physicist in his own right and had formerly worked with British scientist Lord Kelvin.

The Postal Department, Government of India honoured its founder and the institution by issuing a Special Day Postal Cover in 2004. In 2007 to commemorate the completion of its 175 years, a stamp and first day cover of Wilson College was issued.

==&quot;The Wilsonian&quot;==

&quot;The Wilsonian&quot;, the annual magazine publication of Wilson College, was first printed and published from Pune by the Scottish Mission Industries Co. Ltd. on behalf of the Wilson College Literary Society with the first issue appearing in 1909.

The names of the editors do not appear until 1933. &quot;The Wilsonian&quot; was published twice a year from 1909 until 1944, when it was decided to publish it only once a year. &quot;The Wilsonian&quot; has been an annual publication ever since. Launching its debut issue, the motto of &quot;The Wilsonian&quot; was:

Be thou the bond to bind in love and peace
Wilsonians all that are
And were, and are to be

==Architecture==

The building is noted for its large first-floor classrooms with interesting teakwood trusses. These classrooms are protected by deep verandahs, which overlook the Girgaum Chowpatty beach and are protected by the Mangalore tiled roof.
 
The arched veranda with its segmental sandstone arches on the ground floor forms one of the common features of the building. The deep over-hanging verandahs on the west façade facing the sea form a buffer between the classrooms and the exteriors. They bear the brunt of the heavy rains and the sunlight.

As seen in most of the buildings in that period, Minton tiles have been used for the college verandah flooring. The main staircase area has some excellent mosaic tile decoration with floral motifs.

The use of red terracotta tiles in the first floor and the second floor makes the floor look different and these are in a relatively good condition. Many original teakwood doors and windows still exist in the college.

The entrance lobby with its grand staircase is one of the features in all the buildings designed by John Adams. The grand timber staircase with the multi-foil circular panel design in the handrail is another feature extensively used by John Adams in his design. The classrooms have been designed north–south opening into the west verandah. They have ample windows for ventilation and natural light.

The library with its teakwood mezzanines and catwalks is one of the best-maintained areas in the college. The teakwood mezzanines are the extra reading and storage areas in the library – the library furniture has been designed keeping in mind the exact space provision for the storage. The library is divided into bays, which are partitioned with the storage cupboards.

The assembly hall is designed with two level balconies, which were designed to accommodate an orchestra for important functions. The teakwood balcony is supported on the teakwood decorative brackets. There is a multi-foil circular stained glass window with the college crest on it.

The chapel is placed in the north-west corner of the building. The central nave with its arches and the columns has been designed with good acoustics. Each bay of the nave and the side isle has the original lamp fittings illuminating the chapel.

The white marble courtyard fountain is renaissance revival fountain based on one of the famous designs of the famous Italian sculptor Gianlo Renzo Bernini. The fountain is a 3-piece sculptor and is a garden ornament fountain, an order from the catalogue, which was a typical feature in the 19th century. The sculpture depicts the scroll motifs and the long tresses of hair representing the water and river sea nymphs. Fish motifs can also be seen in the hands of the sea nymphs.

During its initial years, two tennis courts situated side by side and a cricket pitch in the center were prepared. Tennis and Cricket were the two most popular outdoor games at the time. However, a need for a pavilion building was urgently felt and efforts were made in that direction. Sir Shapurji Bharucha played a major role in the process, donating INR 10,000/- to meet the cost of construction.

The new pavilion building was opened by Lord Willingdon, former governor of Bombay, on 20 December 1916. Since then, sporting activities of the college have expanded immensely, with the school producing sportspersons at state, national and even international level.

Apart from conventional sports, the college delved into less popular sports like Rugby, Water Polo and Yachting. Rugby was introduced in 1970 by former chemistry professor, Dr. James Barton.

Former Indian Cricketer, Dilip Sardesai; Woman International Master in Chess, Rohini Khadilkar and Arjuna Awardee for proficiency in Yachting, Jeejee Unwalla have all been affiliated to the Wilson College Gymkhana.

On 7 November 1985, former governor of Maharashtra, Kona Prabhakara Rao was quoted saying &quot;In a city like Bombay, provision of sports facilities side by side with education is something which very few colleges can boast of. In this respect, Wilson College, one of the oldest colleges in the city, has been singularly fortunate. They have a Gymkhana which provides excellent sports facilities to their students.&quot;

===National Service Scheme===
Revived in 2001 and guided under the norms of the University of Mumbai, the National Service Scheme (NSS) group of Wilson College forms a part of Independence Day celebration in New Delhi. The volunteers enrolled work as a team on projects of social relevance for two consecutive years. The wing works for the welfare of mentally challenged and the under-privileged children with the assistance of NGOs. Teaching in municipal schools, participating in awareness rallies organised by the university are some of the many activities conducted by NSS. The NSS plays a vital role in conducting blood donation drives in the college twice every year. This has been highly acknowledged by the Blood Bank. Students are sent for Leadership Training Programs. An NSS camp is conducted for a period of 10 days every year where students are involved in projects of social relevance.

===Co-operative Education Program===
Unique to Wilson college, the first Co-operative Education Programme (CEP) was conducted in 1979–80. It is a special programme for SYBsc and SYBA students, which aims at training them to cope with the corporate world and guiding them to meet the expectations in corporate service. It is planned in consultation with experts from renowned industrial background and heads of departments in the college. It is a six weeks programme which is divided into two parts:

For the first three weeks, students are exposed to debates, discussions, talks by experts from various career backgrounds and workshops on personality and leadership development. For the next three weeks, students are offered internship in various organisations.

===The Counselling Centre===
The Wilson College was one of the first colleges under the Mumbai University to set up a counselling centre as early as 1978.

The centre was established as a joint project of the Sophia-Wilson Community. After being rendered defunct in 2000, it was revived in 2003 with the Xavier&#x27;s Institute of Counselling Psychology at St. Xavier&#x27;s College in Mumbai. This collaboration lasted for two years, and the college Counselling Centre began functioning as an independent body since 2005. The Counselling Centre provides the students with a &quot;non-threatening environment to unload their concerns and issues&quot;. The Centre empowers students to deal with emotional and psychological stressors, problems related to peer/parental pressures, identity and managing inter-personal relationships.

Apart from dealing with emotional and stress-related issues, the Counselling Centre provides vocational guidance as well, which involves giving out information on various career options, academic courses, eligibility criteria and suitable institutions.

The centre also helps students tackle academic difficulties like language difficulties, concentration or memory related problems, anxiety and stage fright among others. Both individual and group sessions are used as a part of the counseling process, depending on the student and case at hand.

The Counselling Centre has in the past conducted sessions for the faculty as well, like a half- day seminar themed ‘The Pedagogical Paradigm’, conducted by Ms. Ruby Pavri, lecturer of Psychology in St. Xavier&#x27;s College in the academic year 2007–08. The seminar was aimed at preparing and inspiring the teachers for the new academic year and a fresh batch of students.

===The Wilson College Nature Club (WCNC)===
The Wilson College Nature Club is affiliated with the Nature Club movement of the World Wide Fund for Nature–India (WWF), is one of the most active college-level nature conservation bodies in India.

It was founded 1979 under the initiative of students Farhan Thakur and Shubhada Kalyani, with Prof. B. D. Vakharia of the BOTANY department. A. J. Borde, the then principal of the college, sanctioned the club after realising the need for a body that could organise nature trails and excursions for students of faculties other than Botany and Zoology, who undertook these trails for academic purposes.

With &quot;the quest for sensible, greener options&quot; as its motto, the major activities of the WCNC include conducting nature trails to wilderness areas in Mumbai, usually from July to January, organising overnight treks on the weekends to biodiversity hotspots around Mumbai and 7- to 14-day nature camps to noteworthy national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in India. The WCNC camps are hugely popular among students and alumni for their wide range of activities and experiences. The camps involve treks, sessions on conservation, clean-up sessions, interaction with wildlife officials and even workshops. A rare feature of WCNC camps is its tradition of using music to create awareness and spread the message of conservation. Songs like &quot;And You Say the Battle is Over&quot; by John Denver, &quot;Garbage&quot; by Pete Seger, &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; by Bob Dylan and &quot;Don’t Go Near the Water&quot; by Johnny Cash rank high on the club playlist.

The central idea behind these camps is to create awareness about environmental issues and to better understand the culture and traditions of the places visited. The WCNC holds the distinction of traversing through its camps the northern-, eastern- and southernmost corners of India between 2005 and 2010 alone.

Camp fees are highly subsidised to enable students of all economic backgrounds to attend and, at times, free-ships are awarded to deserving students. Another significant feature of these camps is that they are organised entirely by the staff and students. Conservation activities of the club include organising tree plantation projects, snake shows for students, developing educational material and an annual theme-based exhibition, which runs under the initiative of active WCNC members and is supported by student volunteers from across the college.

The WCNC is also known for its library, which was set up through the efforts of Prof. Vakharia. The library has an extensive collection of old issues of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, the &quot;Sanctuary Asia&quot; magazine and encyclopaedias on flora and fauna.

On its 30th anniversary, the WCNC published a book titled &quot;Wilson College Nature Club: A Journey Through Three Decades&quot;, chronicling the memories and experiences of students, alumni, staff and well-wishers associated with the WCNC over the course of the past 30 years. &quot;Footprint&quot;, the WCNC&#x27;s monthly magazine, is the longest running publication of the club. The WCNC had formed a body exclusively for its alumni in 1981 called the Naturalia Wilsonica, which enabled and encouraged ex-students to continue visiting the wilderness. The body, however, could not be sustained post 1987.

===Wilson College Student Council ===

Student Council was initiated way back in 1900 as a literary society. Now it is represented by top- ranking students from each class who play an active role in organising a number of student centric activities like intra-class competitions, workshops, celebration of college day and Teacher&#x27;s day, orientation programs, etc. It is guided by the norms set by the university.

<text>Timothy Detudamo (1887 or 188811 April 1953) was a Nauruan politician and linguist. He served as Head Chief of Nauru from 1930 until his death in 1953.

==Biography==
Detudamo was born in either 1887 or 1888. He was born in Uaboe District. He was a layman of the Protestant Church of Nauru during his youth, and became assistant to the missionary Rev. Philip Delaporte to be his assistant. In 1917, he was chosen to travel to the United States by Rev Delaporte to translate the Bible into the Nauruan language. To finance the travel, Detudamo needed US$500, which he raised through Nauruan donations. His translation was carried out with the help of Rev Delaporte, a German-American missionary. Detudamo returned to Nauru in 1921. In 1938, he tried to reform the Nauruan language by making it more understandable for Europeans and Americans. However, his reforms were not widely adopted and today the old orthography continues to be more common.

In November 1930 Detudamo was appointed Head Chief of Nauru by Administrator William Augustin Newman following the death of Daimon. He held the office until 1942 when Japan invaded and occupied the island. During the Japanese occupation, Detudamo served as Governor of Nauru until 30 June 1943 when he was deported along with most of the Nauruan population to Chuuk in Micronesia. On 31 January 1946 he returned to Nauru and was duly re-elected to the position of Head Chief. Following the introduction of a Nauru Local Government Council in 1951 Detudamo was elected as a councillor for the Districts of Denigomodu, Nibok, Uaboe, and Baitsi. He was also re-elected as Head Chief by the NLGC 

Detudamo also helped establish the first Nauruan large enterprise, a Nauruan land owners co-operative general store. It was called the Nauru Cooperative Society and adopted the name &#x27;Eigigu&#x27; in symbolically depicting the Nauruan &quot;Lady on the Moon&quot; legend.

Detudamo died in Sydney in Australia on 11 April 1953 at the age of 65, and was succeeded as Head Chief by Raymond Gadabu. His son Buraro later served as an MP and minister.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Gustave Le Gray (; 30 August 1820 – 30 July 1884) was a French painter, draughtsman, sculptor, print-maker, and photographer. He has been called &quot;the most important French photographer of the nineteenth century&quot; because of his technical innovations, his instruction of other noted photographers, and &quot;the extraordinary imagination he brought to picture making.&quot; He was an important contributor to the development of the wax paper negative.

==Biography==
Gustave Le Gray was born on 30 August 1820 in Villiers-le-Bel, Val-d&#x27;Oise. He was an only child of a haberdasher. His parents encouraged him to become a solicitor&#x27;s clerk, but from a young age, he aspired to be an artist. He was originally trained as a painter, studying under François-Édouard Picot and Paul Delaroche. His parents financed a trip to Switzerland and Italy so that he could study art abroad, and he lived in Italy between 1843-1846 and painted portraits and scenes of the countryside. In 1844, he met and married Palmira Maddalena Gertrude Leonardi (born 23 March 1823), a laundress who he had six children with, although only two survived into adulthood.

Le Gray exhibited his paintings at the salon in 1848 and 1853. He then crossed over to photography in the early years of its development.

He made his first daguerreotypes by 1847. His real contributions - artistically and technically - were in the area of paper photography. His early photographs included portraits; scenes of nature such as Fontainebleau Forest; and buildings such as châteaux of the Loire Valley.

He taught photography to students such as Charles Nègre, Henri Le Secq, Nadar, Olympe Aguado, and Maxime Du Camp. In 1851, he became one of the first five photographers hired for the Missions Héliographiques to document French monuments and buildings. In that same year, he helped found the Société Héliographique, the &quot;first photographic organization in the world.&quot; Le Gray published a treatise on photography, which went through four editions, in 1850, 1851, 1852, and 1854.

In 1855, Le Gray opened a &quot;lavishly furnished&quot; studio. At that time, becoming progressively the official photographer of Napoleon III, he became a successful portraitist. His most famous work dates from this period, 1856 to 1858, especially his seascapes. The studio was a fancy place, but in spite of his artistic success, his business was a financial failure: the business was poorly managed and ran into debts. He therefore &quot;closed his studio, abandoned his wife and children, and fled the country to escape his creditors.&quot;

He began to tour the Mediterranean in 1860 with the writer Alexandre Dumas, père. They encountered Giuseppe Garibaldi during the trip and Le Gray photographed Garibaldi and Palermo. His striking pictures of Giuseppe Garibaldi and Palermo under Sicilian bombardment became as instantly famous throughout Europe. Dumas abandoned Le Gray and the other travelers in Malta and joined the revolutionary forces as a result of a personal conflict. Le Gray went to Lebanon, then Syria where he covered the movements of the French army for a magazine in 1861. Injured, he remained there before heading to Egypt. In Alexandria he photographed Henri d&#x27;Artois and the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom, and wrote to Nadar while sending him pictures. In 1862, his wife Leonardi returned to Rome, requesting and receiving 150 francs for financial assistance. In 1863, Leonardi asked Le Gray to provide her with a monthly pension of 50 or 60 francs.

He established himself in Cairo in 1864; earning a modest living as a professor of drawing, while retaining a small photography shop. He sent pictures to the universal exhibition in 1867 but they did not really catch anyone&#x27;s attention. He received commissions from the vice-king Ismail Pasha. From this late period there remain 50 pictures.

In 1868, a collection of photographic seascapes by Gustave Le Gray was donated by millionaire art collector Chauncy Hare Townshend to the Victoria and Albert Museum. (He had kept them in portfolios along with his watercolors, etchings and engravings; they therefore remained in excellent condition, preserved to museum standards almost since they were made.)

On 16 January 1883, he had a son with the nineteen-year-old Anaïs Candounia. Registration of their sons birth was voided due to lack of proof of Leonardi&#x27;s death. Le Gray died on 30 July 1884, in Cairo. His only surviving child from his marriage to Leonardi, Alfred, was designated as his heir.

==Technical innovations==
His technical innovations included:
* Improvements on paper negatives, specifically waxing them before exposure &quot;making the paper more receptive to fine detail&quot;.
* A collodion process published in 1850 but which was &quot;theoretical at best&quot;. The invention of the wet collodion method to produce a negative on a glass plate is now credited to Frederick Scott Archer who published his process in 1851.
* Combination printing, creating seascapes by using one negative for the water and one negative for the sky.

==Works==
Le Gray documented French monuments on a mission for the French government with other French photographers.

He was a successful portrait photographer, capturing figures such as Napoleon III and Edward VII. He also became famous for his seascapes, or marine. He spent 20 years in Cairo, Egypt, but there are few works from this period.

===World records for most expensive photograph sold at auction, 1999–2003===
In October 1999, Sotheby&#x27;s sold a Le Gray albumen print &quot;Beech Tree, Fontainebleau&quot; for £419,500, which was a world record for the most expensive single photograph ever sold at auction, to an anonymous buyer. At the same auction, an albumen print of &quot;The Great Wave, Sète&quot; by Le Gray was sold for a new world record price of £507,500 or $840,370 to &quot;the same anonymous buyer&quot; who was later revealed to be Sheik Saud Al-Thani of Qatar. The record stood until May 2003 when Al-Thani purchased a daguerreotype by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey for £565,250 or $922,488.

<text>S. H. Kress &amp; Co. was the trading name of a chain of five and dime retail department stores in the United States established by Samuel Henry Kress. It operated from 1896 to 1981. In the first half of the 20th century, there were Kress stores with ornamented architecture in hundreds of cities and towns.

==History==

Kress opened his first stationery and notions store in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, in 1887. The chain of S. H. Kress &amp; Co. 5-10-25 Cent Stores was established in 1896 in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 1920s and 1930s, Kress sold a house label of phonograph records under the Romeo trademark. He died in 1955.

The events that led to the Harlem riot of 1935 began at the Kress department store at 256 W 125th Street across from the Apollo Theater.

The company&#x27;s exclusion of African Americans from its lunch counters also made Kress a target for civil rights protests during the 1960 lunch counter sit-ins, along with Woolworth&#x27;s, Rexall and other national chains. In Nashville, TN, Kress repeatedly refused to serve the protesters but eventually agreed to integrate the downtown store in reaction to a consumer boycott. The Greensboro, North Carolina Kress was included in the first civil rights demonstrations in the South. In &quot;Adickes v. S.H. Kress Co.&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out convictions for vagrancy resulting from a sit-in at a Kress lunch counter in Mississippi. The Kress store in Baton Rouge was the site of that city&#x27;s first civil rights sit-in. That event helped save it from demolition 45 years later.

In 1964, Genesco, Inc., acquired Kress. The company abandoned its center-city stores and moved to shopping malls. Genesco began liquidating Kress and closing down the Kress stores in 1980. The remaining Kress stores were sold to McCrory Stores on January 1, 1981. Most continued to operate under the Kress name until McCrory Stores went out of business in 2001.

Tiendas Kress, the subsidiary chain in Puerto Rico, survived the parent company until its remaining locations closed in 2022. The Kress Foundation, a philanthropic organization promoting art, was established by Kress in 1929 and also survives the parent company.

==Architecture==


The Kress chain was known for the architecture of its buildings. &quot;Samuel H. Kress... envisioned his stores as works of public art that would contribute to the cityscape.&quot; A number of former Kress stores are recognized as architectural landmarks and many are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the 1913 building on Canal Street in New Orleans (now the New Orleans Ritz-Carlton) and the 1929 neoclassical store in Asheville, North Carolina.

Notable Kress architects include Seymour Burrell, who studied in New York with architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, and Edward Sibbert, who designed more than fifty Art Deco S. H. Kress &amp; Co. stores between 1929 and 1944.

Sibbert&#x27;s buildings streamlined the Kress image with a sleek buff modernity, the lavish use of terracotta ornament, and strong verticals supporting the golden letters &quot;Kress&quot;. Curved glass display windows led the shopper through heavy bronze doors into an interior of rich marbles, fine woods, and large customized counters set crosswise down a long sales floor. Well-positioned hanging lamps created a bright atmosphere for an endless array of inexpensive items (there were 4,275 different articles on sale in 1934). Everything – from the constantly restocked merchandise to the gracious retiring rooms and popular soda fountain in the basement – encouraged customers to linger. Like the great movie houses of the day, the dime store – and ‘Kress’s’ in particular – was a popular destination during hard economic times.

Sibbert&#x27;s Mayan Revival Kress store on Fifth Avenue in New York City was built in 1935 and demolished in 1980.

A seven-story marble structure designed for every shopping comfort, its Art Deco elegance was graced by airborne Mayan gods on the sales floor and Mayan-style hieroglyphs of the gloves and padlocks and yard goods for sale. Awarded a gold medal for architectural quality, the store represented the zenith of the Kress empire in luxury, modernity, and retailing capacity.

The downtown Kress store in Greensboro, North Carolina, is a characteristic example that shows the chain&#x27;s use of elaborate exterior details including coats-of-arms, metal work, and inlaid artistic flourishes on the keystones and corners.

The National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., holds a permanent collection of Kress building &quot;records, including thousands of drawings and photographs relating to the design, construction, and operation of more than 200 stores stretching from New York to Hawaii.&quot;

<doc id="1215580" wikidata="Q539284" url="?curid=1215580" title="Kaleido Star">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series produced by Gonzo. The series was created by Junichi Sato, who also directed the first season, and written by Reiko Yoshida. &quot;Kaleido Star: New Wings&quot; was directed by Yoshimasa Hiraike. Three original video animations have been produced, as well as a manga series and a novel. The series follows Sora Naegino, a young Japanese girl, who travels to the United States to fulfill her dream of performing at the world-famous Kaleido Stage.

==Plot==
===First Season===
Sora Naegino is a young Japanese girl with great acrobatic talent who travels to Cape Mery (a mix of Los Angeles and San Francisco), California in hopes of auditioning for the Kaleido Stage, a world-famous circus which has mesmerized her since childhood. However, she runs into difficulties as soon as she arrives. She gets lost on her way to the Stage, is leered at by a mysterious stranger, and has her bag stolen by a thief. Employing her acrobatic skills, Sora chases down the criminal.

A kind police officer gives her a ride to Kaleido Stage only to discover she had missed her audition, an event upon which her idol, Layla Hamilton, advises her to return to Japan. However, after a performer is injured, the owner of the circus, Kalos, offers her a chance to perform. Sora, humiliated by her failed efforts decides to return to Japan. Kalos, having seen her earlier chase, reconsiders and informs Layla that Sora&#x27;s performance will eventually be the main act at the circus, earning her reluctant respect.

The other members of Kaleido Stage, particularly Layla, are dissatisfied with Sora. With the help of stage manager Ken Robbins, the performers Mia Guillem and Anna Heart, young Marion Benigni, as well as a lot of hard work and determination, Sora begins to earn the respect of those around her. Her personality eventually earns the respect of the performers as well as several increasingly major roles in the productions. She also befriends Layla over time.

However, Layla&#x27;s father pressures her to leave and insiders plan to take over and shut down Kaleido Stage. Sora relies on her winning personality, hard work and close friendships to keep the stage afloat.

===&quot;New Wings&quot;===
In the second season, Sora returns to the stage after attempting the Legendary Great Maneuver with Layla. This leaves Layla&#x27;s shoulder injured and unable to perform. The absence of her co-star, having retired to further a career in Broadway productions, prompts a slight decline of the Kaleido Stage. Because of this Kalos brings in a new recruit, Leon Oswald (a lofty trapeze artist). It seems at first that Leon is reminded very much of someone due to Sora&#x27;s presence, and at times this causes him to either be really rude or really sweet to Sora.

Despite this, however, Leon disapproves Sora as worthy of being on the stage with him. This leads to the most talented of the new Kaleido Stage recruits, the Chinese-American May Wong (who is also an ex-figure skater) to question and challenge Sora&#x27;s position as Leon&#x27;s partner and star of the show. After a very ugly incident, however, May begins to question herself and her goals.

Sora&#x27;s first goal in the season is to attend the circus festival in Paris, but the competitors will do anything to attain the title of &#x27;festival winner&#x27;: betray, deceive, or even attack their opposers. The atmosphere and attitude this creates does not bode kindly to Sora&#x27;s carefree, optimistic, ultra-idealistic outlook. It, in turn, causes her to withdraw from the competition in the middle of her act (or the Angel Act) with the redeemed Yuri Killian, leaving her friends, family and Layla confused and otherwise disappointed with Sora.

Most of the season concentrates on Sora finding, questioning, and pursuing new dreams. After many trials and rejections, Sora eventually aims to become a &quot;True Kaleido Star&quot; while creating a fun, conflict-free stage, the complete opposite of what she experiences at the festival in Paris.

===&quot;The Amazing Princess Without a Smile&quot;===
The first OVA looks at a new production in the works that follows the Kaleido Stage&#x27;s success with &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, about a female princess that is unable to smile and a jester of hers that is hoping to bring her smile back. The idea for the production came to Mia from a painting that featured a character that looked very similar to Rosetta and a jester in the background that looked surprisingly like Fool (the stage spirit that can be seen only by very talented students).

Rosetta is assigned the lead role as the princess. Unfortunately, despite the likeliness of her being able to comprehend the role fully as &quot;she&quot; herself never carried a smile when she first came to Kaleido Stage, she has difficulties acting out the part and leaves the rehearsals mid-way frustrated. Will Rosetta be able to play the role right? What ties does Fool have with the painting of the princess and the jester?

===&quot;Legend of Phoenix: Layla Hamilton Story&quot;===
Layla and Sora are about to launch different interpretations of the same show &quot;Legend of Phoenix&quot; on opposite coasts. Layla is preparing at the Broadway but is dissatisfied with her performance. She feels that she cannot perform the role properly if she is not truly reborn as a new Layla Hamilton. In a desperate attempt to be reborn, Layla runs off on a solo bicycle trip to upstate New York in hopes of rediscovering herself.

Meanwhile, Sora is also attempting to find her own Phoenix, but when she learns of Layla&#x27;s disappearance she, Ken and May run off to New York to find the former Kaleido Star who at that instant was on a bike journey with no set destination.

Layla meets various strangers and reminisces memories of her childhood along the way as she thinks of how she can change herself. But while she tries to find a new self, she spends her entire time alone thinking about Sora until she comes to realize just how much Sora has been a muse to her. Once she realizes that, she is reborn. The nature of this revelation, though speculated in different ways by various fans, is up to interpretation. During the end credits, we are shown two different Phoenixes.

===&quot;Good da yo! Goood!!&quot;===
&quot;Good da yo! Goood!!&quot; is a 22 minutes OVA that is rendered by computer graphics. All of the characters are presented super deformed. The OVA is split up into three parts. The first part is a lesson in Chinese cooking presented by May Wong; the dish that is presented is mapo doufu. The second part is a lesson on how to use the diabolo by Rosetta Passel. The final part is a lesson in seal lingo presented by Marion and Jonathan to Sora.

===Manga===
A manga series, titled &quot;Kaleido Star ~Wings of the Future~&quot;, began serialization in &quot;Shōnen Fang&quot;″s on 19 February 2007. The story takes place fifteen years after the events of the anime series and it revolves around Sora&#x27;s younger sister, Yume. Because Sora has not visited her family in years for reasons unknown, Yume joins Kaleido Stage in hopes to meet her.

Serialization in &quot;Shōnen Fang&quot; magazine ended in September 2007 when the magazine went defunct.

===Novel===
A novel, titled , was released on 10 February 2006.

==Reception==
===Season 1===
In a review of the first Volume, Anime News Network called the series &quot;heartwarming fluff without too many sugar calories&quot; and praised the Japanese voice cast for stellar performances, with particular emphasis on Ryo Hirohashi and Takehito Koyasu. Anime On DVD also noted Koyasu&#x27;s performance, the quality of the animation in the performance scenes, and the fulfilling climax of the final episode. Mike Lewis of Underland Online noted &quot;Kaleido Star&quot; as being &quot;...an extraordinary series is in a class all its own.&quot;

===Season 2===
Despite being put off by the recap episodes, Anime News Network positively reviewed the first Volume of &quot;Kaleido Star: New Wings&quot;. While critiquing the story as &quot;straight from the shōjo drama playbook,&quot; the review held praise for the visuals, stating that &quot;the best thing about Kaleido Star is, far and away, the amazing animation and production values. The circus scenes are wildly original and sometimes breathtaking; the animation quality hasn&#x27;t dipped at all in the second season.&quot; Cynthia Martinez also won notice for developing her performance as Sora. Anime Advanced also looked at the first volume and praised it highly, noting that &quot;Kaleido Star gets my highest possible recommendation. This is a show that dreams are made of.&quot;

Summing up the series, Chris Beveridge of Anime On DVD said that &quot;Kaleido Star has been a great series overall with a somewhat weak second season that really took its time to find its own voice,&quot; but that &quot;it&#x27;s still a series that&#x27;s very easy to recommend on a whole and one that is very much worth showing to a younger audience.&quot; ActiveAnime&#x27;s Holly Ellingwood commented that &quot;The finale is climatic and fulfilling.&quot; and summarized the series as being &quot;An anime that is a pure joy to watch. Exhilarating, Kaleido Star is a stirring series that is both inspirational and remarkable.&quot;

===Extra Stage===
Anime On DVD proclaimed the OVA to be &quot;a beautiful piece of work and the best way to close out things for a while as it is much more oriented on the comedy and the lighter side of the characters... It&#x27;s a great little self-contained story that plays strong in a similar fashion to the last episode of the series but without quite so much angst and hardship associated with it. It leaves you laughing and really smiling at the end of the disc.&quot;

<text>Gloria Elizabeth Reuben (born June 9, 1964) is a Canadian-American actress, producer, and singer. She is well-known for her role as Jeanie Boulet on the medical drama &quot;ER&quot; (1995–1999, 2008), for which she was twice nominated for an Emmy Award, and for portraying Elizabeth Keckley in the 2012 Steven Spielberg–directed film &quot;Lincoln&quot;.

<text>Yokneam Illit (), also &quot;Yoqne&#x27;am Illit&quot; and &quot;Jokneam Illit&quot;, is a city in northern Israel. It is located in a hilly region of the Lower Galilee at the base of the Carmel Mountains, and overlooks the Jezreel Valley. It is from Haifa and from Tel Aviv. Yokneam, known as Israel&#x27;s &quot;Startup Village,&quot; is home to a high-tech hub surrounded by forests and small communities.

Yokneam Illit was founded in 1950. It was recognized as a local council in 1967 and achieved city status in 2007. It is located on the route of Israel&#x27;s major highways – Highway 70 and Highway 6. In it had a population of . In 1989, after Simon Alfassi was elected mayor, Yokneam Illit began to attract high-tech companies looking for an alternative to the Tel Aviv area. Over 100 high-tech companies now operate from Yokneam Illit, generating exports of approximately 5 billion US dollars annually. Although real estate prices are low relative to the Tel Aviv area, the high rate of growth has pushed prices up faster than in similar-sized cities.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Yokneam appears in the list of 119 conquered cities by Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III after the victory in the battle of Megiddo (1468 BC).

Yokneam or Jokneam is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a city of Levites within the territory of the Israelite tribe of Zebulun (). It is located near Megiddo (Armageddon). The Crusaders called Yokneam &quot;Cain Mons&quot;, or &quot;Mountain of Cain&quot; in keeping with the tradition that Cain, son of Adam (), was murdered at this site.

Yokneam was populated throughout the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman/Byzantine, Arab, Crusaders, Mameluk, and Ottoman periods.

Yokneam was built on the lands of a Palestinian Arab village named Qira, depopulated in the lead up to the 1948 Arab–Israeli war.
===British Mandate===
The Yokneam Moshava was established in 1935.
===State of Israel===
In July 1950, a tent camp (Maabara) was set up to absorb 250 new immigrant families and remained part of Yokneam Moshava until 1967. By the start of 1952, another 400 families were housed in the tent camp. Toward the end of 1951, the first 285 families moved from the tent camp to permanent housing on the hill above the Yokneam Moshava. In 1952, Yokneam was considered unusual in that it had a single school for all regardless of whether they were religious or secular, or from the moshava or the tent camp.

In 1964, Yokneam had 4,300 residents. 160 families were living in the moshava. In 1967, Yokneam split into two local councils: Yokneam and Yokneam Illit.

In the 1980s, 90 percent of the residents worked in the two local factories in Yokneam. In September 1990, the Soltam factory shut down creating high unemployment .

In the 1990s, Yokneam absorbed a large wave of immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union. During that time, Yokneam&#x27;s industrial parks began to attract high-tech firms.

Yokneam Illit was formally declared a city in 2006. In 2009, Yokneam was linked to Highway 6 and received recognition as Israel&#x27;s first &quot;Green City&quot; in the Cleantech competition. In the wake of these development s, Yokneam became a hub for medical, cleantech and product development companies.

In 2011, 16,000 workers entered the industrial parks every day. Of these, only 4,000 were local residents.

==Demography==
In 2014, Yokneam had a population of 21,100. The unemployment rate was 5 percent, which was lower than the national average. The median age was 32. 76% of Yokneam Illit&#x27;s residents were 40 years old or under. Eighty percent of high-school students graduated with a bagrut matriculation certificate, which was one of the highest rates in Israel. 40% of the population were college graduates.

==Social and economic ecosystem==
Since the 1950s when Yokneam Moshava and Yokneam Illit shared a single school, social integration and coexistence has been an integral part of the local culture. The first wave of immigrants to settle in the Maabara (tent camp) had major contingents from at least 6 different Jewish communities (Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, Romania, Yemen and India), all of whom were absorbed by the Moshava which had been settled in 1935 by Jews from Germany and the Netherlands.

The next wave of new immigrants came in the 1960s from North Africa, followed by immigrants from the Soviet Union in the 1970s. In the 1990s, Yokneam Illit absorbed large numbers of immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union.

Starting in the 1990s, the growth of high-tech companies in Yokneam Illit also brought an influx of Israeli-born residents along with an increasing number of immigrants from Western Europe, South Africa, North America and South America. During this period, the economic problems of the Kibbutz and Moshav movements led many of the young families in the Megiddo Regional Council to move to nearby Yokneam Illit.

Yokneam Illit&#x27;s accelerated demand for day care and Kindergartens led to a shortage of space in local day care and Kindergartens at the same time that there was a shortage of children at some of the Kibbutzim. In order to avoid sending their children to other small communities in the area, Kibbutz children&#x27;s houses and Kindergartens began accepting children from nearby Yokneam Illit, and in some cases the number of children from Yokneam Illit outnumbered the Kibbutz children. This phenomenon later extended to the elementary and secondary schools until the building of new schools in Yokneam Illit was able to catch up with demand.

Many of the children from Yokneam Illit and their families remained in the Megiddo school system, while families who moved from the Megiddo communities to Yokneam Illit were educating their children in the Yokneam Illit school system. The family ties and school friendships led to mixed Yokneam-Megiddo parents groups in both communities and nearly all sports activities and many other after-school activities being fully integrated. Today, it is extremely rare to find a local team representing only Yokneam Illit or only the Megiddo Regional Council.

The Partnership2Gether program, which partnered Yokneam Illit and the Megiddo Regional Council on the Israeli side, with the Jewish communities of Atlanta, GA and St. Louis, MO on the US side, helped institutionalize cooperation between the Yokneam Illit municipality and the Megiddo Regional Council. The impact on joint community leadership not only affected Yokneam-Megiddo, but also created an ongoing relationship between the Jewish communities of Atlanta and St. Louis.

This cross-pollination has led to an integrated economic ecosystem that help support the high-tech companies in Yokneam Illit. Examples of this cooperation can be seen in the activities of the Southeast chapter of the US-Israel Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta, and the success of companies like Given Imaging . Given Imaging, which began as a small startup in Yokneam Illit, leveraged its special relationship with the Southeast chapter of the US-Israel Chamber of Commerce when it opened its Marketing headquarters in Atlanta, GA.

==Economy==

=== Overview ===

Yokneam&#x27;s proximity to two major universities (Technion and University of Haifa, both in Haifa), location at the crossroads between northern Israel and the major urban areas of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, tax benefits and investment grants associated with its status as a &quot;National Priority Area A&quot;, and its small town surroundings and lower cost of housing all worked together to attract Israel&#x27;s highest concentration of R&amp;D companies outside of Tel Aviv and give it the nickname of Startup Village.

Under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment, approved enterprises in Yokneam Illit enjoy the highest level of tax benefits and investment grants (currently up to 20% of the investment or 10 year tax exemption). In addition, companies relocating to the region can apply for concessions in local taxes over a three-year period from the Yokneam Illit Local Authority.
Yokneam&#x27;s industrial parks are home to more than 100 high-tech companies with exports of approximately 5 billion US dollars annually. Companies specialize in a wide range of technologies, including semicondcutors, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. These include Intel, Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Medtronic, Given Imaging, Naiot Venture Accelerator, Mellanox Technologies, Marvell Technology Group, Biosense Webster and Lumenis. An additional high-tech park, Mevo Carmel Jewish-Arab Industrial Park, is already underway that will be a joint venture of Yokneam Illit, Megiddo Regional Council and the Druze villages of Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya.

The growth of the high-tech companies in Yokneam has attracted speakers and members of specialized professions, such as technical writers, to come from other parts of Israel to meet and exchange ideas.
In addition to technology-based industry, Yokneam has a number of production facilities, including Osem, which established a plant in Yokneam in 1974; and a boutique winery, Morad Winery, known for its special wines made from Pomegranates, Passion Fruit, Red Grapefruits, Coffee, Coconuts, Carub and many other fruits. Initially, the plant produced mainly pasta products, but the scope of activities broadened over the years. In 1997, the facility doubled in size and three production lines were installed for baked goods such as crackers, biscuits, cookies and pretzels. Bamba, a popular Israeli snack food, is also produced in Yokneam. Many Yokneam residents are employed at the plant, which won awards from the Council for a Beautiful Israel for its attractive premises.

In addition to these exits, Lumenis recently merged with an affiliate of China&#x27;s XIO group for a reported $510 million.

===Technology incubators===
As the number of hi-tech companies in Yokneam grow, technology incubators have begun opening in or moving to Yokneam, each specializing in different types of technology.

==Parks and recreation==

Yokneam is a very green city. Not just in terms of ecological activism, but also in terms of its physical surroundings. Roughly two-thirds of the land within Yokneam&#x27;s city limits are green space (parks, archeological digs, gardens, playgrounds). It has five major public parks, and outdoor amphitheater and over 80 playgrounds distributed throughout the city. Tel Yokneam, which includes the ruins of a crusader church and its intricate water system, is used as an educational site where Yokneam&#x27;s school children perform restoration work under the direction of the Antiquities Authority and the National Parks Authority.
Nearly 13 kilometers of bicycle paths connect all of the parks and public spaces. The city is also surrounded by the Ramot Menashe Biosphere Reserve of the Megiddo Regional Council, which is currently in the process of becoming recognized by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve.

Each year thousands of Israelis participate in Yokneam&#x27;s annual walking event which began in 1991. In 2013 there were 35,000 participants. The event takes place in the Spring, with a short route of 6 km and a longer route of 11 km through the hills and valleys that surround Yokneam. The 2014 walking event is scheduled for April 17, 2014.

==Transportation==
Yokneam sits at the intersections of Highway 70 and Highway 6, which connect all of Israel with both Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. One of the main stations of the new railway line, being in operation from 2016, from the Jordanian border to the port of Haifa is located only 5 minutes from the Yokneam&#x27;s high-tech parks. Yokneam is 20–25 minutes from Haifa Airport and 12 minutes from the Ramat David airbase, which is reported to be the most likely location for a new International airport to complement Ben Gurion Airport.

The bus service in Yokneam is provided by 3 bus companies. Superbus provides the local service in Yokneam and intercity service to Haifa and Afula. Superbus also runs night lines (including Friday nights) to Haifa, Kiryat Tivon and Ramat Ishai. All bus stops are handicapped-accessible. Egged and Nateev Express provide express intercity services to Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak and Jerusalem, as well as service with stops along the way.

There is a taxi stand at the shopping mall at the eastern entrance to Yokneam Illit.

The Yokneam Illit Municipality encourages the use of bicycles in the city. It currently has 13 km of bicycle paths that connect all of it public parks and buildings.

==Education==
Yokneam allocates 42% of its budget to education. With 75% of its students passing the national matriculation exams and a dropout rate of only 0.8%, Yokneam Illit was awarded the National Education Prize and the Regional Education Prize several times in recent years. Preschool from age 3 has been free in Yokneam Illit for 20 years.

The municipality of Yokneam has developed a special relationship with the Jewish communities of Atlanta, GA and Saint Louis, MO, whereby all three communities work together to create programs for bridging the gaps between communities and cultures, and to provide all students with equal opportunities.

The Environmental Protection Ministry (Israel) awarded a number of Yokneam&#x27;s kindergartens and elementary schools the “green label” because of the way they integrated study of the environment into the local curriculum. In grades three through six, elementary school students spend a full week during school at the city&#x27;s Science Museum.
The IDF Head of Manpower Planning recently awarded the city a special excellence prize for achieving an 87% level of enlistment in the IDF and the eighth highest level of recruitment to elite units and officers courses in all of Israel.

Construction of a &quot;breakthrough&quot; educational campus is nearly complete, with an educational infrastructure for study from kindergarten to high school that will eliminate the transitions that affect students’ lives. The campus will have sports halls, day care centers, kindergartens, elementary and high schools, and academic courses prior to IDF enlistment.

In addition to Yokneam&#x27;s proximity to Technion(23.8 km), University of Haifa(22 km), and Oranim Academic College(7.5 km), Yokneam has a branch of the Open University for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. The municipality is currently trying to expand on this by working with major universities to open branches in Yokneam.

==Culture==

Residents of Yokneam Illit are avid theater goers and there are three local theaters, Yokneam City Theater (seats 475), Tarbuta (seats 200) and an amateur theater MixArt.

Israel&#x27;s best-known theater groups come to perform at The Yokneam City Theater operates 6 days a week. The subscription series with 8 different performances a year from Israel&#x27;s best-known theater companies has grown from one day of the week to five in order to accommodate a total audience of over 2,000, or 10% of its population. The theater also runs two subscription series for children with a total of 600 subscribers, one for ages 3–6 and the other for ages 6–10. A separate &quot;Fringe&quot; series has 200 subscribers for one-man or small theater companies and nontraditional theater performances. Low cost and subsidized performances that are outside of the subscription series include performances in Yiddish by the &quot;Yiddish Shpiel&quot; company , events for the Ethiopian community, children&#x27;s concerts, and animation theater. The Jewish Federation subsidizes children&#x27;s theater subscriptions for members of the Ethiopian community to bring their cost of a child accompanied by one parent down to 100 ILS (approximately US$30) for the entire series. The local Artists&#x27; Guild makes use of the theater to display artwork from local and outside artists.

A second theater house, Tarbuta , seats 200. The Family Empowerment Center also runs a Drama-Therapy group for Ethiopian women that performs in Hebrew and Amharic.
During the summer months, musicians from all over Israel perform in the open air Amphitheater.

MixArt is an amateur studio established in 2017 under the patronage of Yokneam&#x27;s Department of Absorption and performing plays in Russian and Hebrew. To date, this group does not have its own scene.

There are also many dance performances held at Kibbutz Ein HaShofet, just outside Yokneam. One of Israel&#x27;s largest movie houses, Yes Planet, is only 15 minutes away.

Yokneam Illit does not have any bars or pubs. Young people looking for more than wine or beer at a restaurant or coffee shop go to nearby Ramat Ishai.
==Religion==
Yokneam is known for its religious tolerance, with many extended families consisting of a mixture of secular and religious Jews. Despite its small size, Yokneam Illit is an ethnically diverse city, with immigrants from all parts of the world and their descendants and many active synagogues, each with its own special character.
==Sports==
Yokneam has two indoor Basketball Courts (Dahari Sports Center and Hapoel Sports Center), a Tennis Association, a new Country Club including an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, an additional community swimming pool, and a Soccer field, which is run by the Hapoel sports association and is very active with the school age children.

The Yokneam-Megiddo Region has two baseball teams that represent their Sister Cities (the Atlanta Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals). These teams have participated in many tournaments: Jr Macabbiah Games, European Tournaments and the Israeli Junior Olympics where they received the bronze medal. One of the local Kibutz&#x27; has donated the land necessary to build a new Baseball/Softball Stadium in conjunction with the Israel Softball Association and the Jewish National Fund. The Israel Softball Association is helping to start a Special Education Program for the families in the area. In 2012–2013, Yokneam had a player make the Junior National Team which traveled to Denmark that summer.

Starting in 2012, 12 youngsters from Daliyat al-Karmel began taking part in a weekly co-existence program at the Israel Tennis Center as part of a tennis school financed by the Freddie Krivine Foundation.

==Israel&#x27;s first &quot;Green City&quot;==
In 2009, the Cleantech Authority of the Environmental Protection Ministry (Israel) awarded the city of Yokneam Illit a prize for its overall strategy of protecting and nurturing green spaces and encouraging environmental awareness and education. It was again awarded the &quot;Green City&quot; prize in 2014, where the parameters measured included: energy efficiency, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and waste separation, water and sewage, environment-friendly &quot;green&quot; construction, public gardens, environmental education, beauty of the city, environment-friendly &quot;green&quot; commerce and industry, care of urban public grounds and nature, and urban management.

The city has its own environmental protection committee responsible for defining and implementing an overall strategy for improving the quality of life and protecting the environment. The strategy emphasizes: planned development, environmental management, educational programs for environmental protection, urban sanitation, cause and effect management, and conservation of energy and water. It actively promotes walking and use of bicycles for transportation, and all bus stops are handicapped-accessible.

Yokneam Illit&#x27;s 500 dunams of public parks and its 50 m2/person of open urban space is 5 times the minimum recommendation for urban planning. In addition to the annual &quot;Yokneam Walk&quot;, which attracts thousands of participants, the works closely with the Israel National Fund (Keren Kayemet) to further promote nature preservation.

Yokneam Illit is one of 31 municipalities that separates garbage at the source, as well as having waste separation centers distributed throughout the city. The drainage systems work well and stockpile water for reuse in city parks and gardens. The city also uses a computerized irrigation system to save water and achieve optimal results. Sewage is treated at the water treatment plants that are located in nearby Kiryat Tivon.

As part of Yokneam&#x27;s commitment to adopting green energy it will soon be one of the first two cities in northern Israel where electric buses will operate.

The municipality invests both time and money to maintain the natural beauty of its green spaces. Its building codes have become stricter and greener as the demand for housing has increased. A &quot;green&quot; neighborhood is currently under construction which includes environment friendly lighting, irrigation and waste management. At the same time, the municipality has actively worked to make the older neighborhoods more attractive.

The city runs environmental leadership workshops. Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia run a program to teach and preserve traditional farming methods. The education system is defined as “green”, with environmental studies built into the curriculum.

==Municipal budget and fiscal management==
Yokneam Municipality&#x27;s policies stress savings and proper management. Over the years, it has won financial prizes for proper management, which have been invested in city employees and local improvement. The municipality has privatized a range of services including gardening, garbage collection, and rates collection, resulting in substantial savings for reinvestment. The city&#x27;s annual budget of NIS 112 million is balanced and is collected from 95% of residents and 97% of businesses and industrial enterprises.
The municipal budget for 2014 is 135,889,000.

<doc id="1215595" wikidata="Q732561" url="?curid=1215595" title="Taidō">
<text>Taidō is a Japanese martial art created in 1965 by Seiken Shukumine (1925–2001). Taidō has its roots in traditional Okinawan karate. Feeling that the martial arts, particularly karate, were not adapting to meet the needs of a changing world, Shukumine first developed a style of karate called Genseiryū around 1950.

The Taidō is practiced in ten countries, including Japan, Haiti, Australia, England, France, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. The martial art is particularly popular in Finland.

==Founding==

Initially, Seiken Shukumine had founded Genseiryū Karate. But eventually, Shukumine was convinced that the limitations of karate lay in its linear mode of training. He considered how to make the defense more flexible and universal.

In 1965 Shukumine introduced a new martial art. This martial art is a further development of Genseiryū which he named Taidō. Taidō is not to be regarded as karate, but as a new martial art. Taidō&#x27;s techniques offered many innovations: the inclusion of spinning and twisting movements, gymnastic maneuvers, speedy and effective footwork, and a changing body angle.

From that point on, Shukumine was mainly involved with Taidō and many of his pupils started to train in Taidō as well. However, some students of Taidō kept a friendly relationship with some students of Genseiryū and Shukumine was still occasionally involved with his former students, as he wished for them to join him in Taido.

Taidō&#x27;s purpose was, and continues to be, the application of scientific methodology and traditional values to the evolution of the martial arts. According to its creator, Taidō&#x27;s ultimate aim is to equip its practitioners to function at a high level in society.

In 1984, the World Taido Federation was established, globally standardizing the martial art of Taido. The first official World Championships in the sport were held in Japan in 1993.

==Five principles of Taidō==
The five principles of Taidō are:
*Keep your mind as clear and calm as the polished surface of a mirror. This way you will see the heart of things. Having the right state of mind will help you avoid confusion.
*Be composed. Body and mind should be one. Bear yourself correctly and you need to never fear insults.
*Invigorate your spirit from the source of energy deep in your abdomen. With the right spirit you will never fear combat.
*In every action, follow the correct precepts you have been taught. By doing so you cannot act wrongly.
*Be adaptable in your techniques and maintain freedom of physical movement. The right technique will prevent you from being dominated.

==Five types of body movements==
Taidō classifies attack and defense techniques into five categories of body movement:

*&quot;Sen&quot; (旋) - Vertical spinning movement
*&quot;Un&quot; (運) - Ascending and descending wave-like movement
*&quot;Hen&quot; (変) - Falling movement characterized by changing the body&#x27;s axis
*&quot;Nen&quot; (捻) - Horizontal spinning movement
*&quot;Ten&quot; (転) - Rolling and tumbling movement

These movements are combined with punches, kicks, and other techniques. The last category, &quot;Ten&quot;, includes acrobatic movements, for instance back-flips, which makes Taidō spectacular to watch.

Taidō has a special kind of footwork, which is called &quot;unsoku&quot;, as well as non-stepping (acrobatic) locomotion, called &quot;unshin&quot;.

==Competition==

Competitions in Taidō include &quot;Jissen&quot; (sparring), &quot;Hokei&quot; (which is similar to kata), and &quot;Tenkai&quot;, which is a made-up fight, where one &quot;hero&quot; defeats five opponents during the last part of a 30-second bout. In Tenkai the judges give points to the competing teams in a similar manner as is done in for instance figure skating.

=== Jissen (Sparring) ===
Taido is a semi contact sport. A taido match is won by the competitor who is either the first to score a full point (ippon), or has more points when the time ends. A good hit must have proper and legal technique, timing, target, contact and kiai (a shout accompanying the strike). The head is not a valid target. Also, hits must not knock out the other person, but simply indicate the weak point in the opponent&#x27;s defence.

A kick or a punch is worthy of ippon when it is performed from proper taido movement, has control, lands on the opponent&#x27;s torso and is finally followed by an immediate retraction and return to one&#x27;s original position. Failing these, an imperfect hit can however merit a half point (wazari) or a quarter point (yuko).

Warnings are given for improper and bad movement, poor basic stance, wrong target area for strikes or physical damage to the opponent. Typical of a taido match is the constant movement, used for maintaining good distance to the opponent and gaining a feasible offensive position. Turning and twisting moves, acrobatics and shifts in body axes are integral parts of a taido match.

There are no weight classes in taido, because a taidoka must be able to fight against all and any kinds of opponents.

=== Hokei ===

Movements sets are an inherent part of training in martial arts, and are made up of various basic techniques. They function as a powerful form of basic training, developing both technique, strength, speed and body control. The name for taido&#x27;s movement sets is hokei.

There are 10 basic hokeis in taido. All of these sets have a basic, prearranged shape and form, but a competitor may change the rhythm and breathing of the hokei as long as the essence of the hokei remains unchanged. A competitor may also receive extra points from the referees, if the difficulty of the hokei is heightened via addition of somersaults or other moves, not found in the basic version.

The movement sets do not exist only for basic techniques, however, but also for practising combinations and training fighting against imaginary foes. Thus a good form will contain, in addition to good technique, changes in rhythm and features of offence and defence, such as focusing one&#x27;s eyes on the imagined enemy, movement and production of power. Hokei is an official competition in taido, all the way up to European and World Championship level.

Those who have trained taido for a longer time will also practise hokeis for special techniques and breathing. In all hokeis the result of the match will be determined by three judges, all of whom announce via a raised flag which of the participants won.

=== Dantai jissen ===

Dantai jissen, or team sparring, is fought between two teams of five competitors each. Women may have 3-person teams. Matches are played out individually, and the team that accumulates more victories wins.

In dantai jissen the rules and scoring is similar to individual jissen, so a full point (ippon), half point (wazari) and quarter point (yuko) are available, but in addition a single match can also end in a draw, hikiwake.

A kick or a punch is worthy of ippon when it is performed from proper Taido movement, has control, lands on the opponent&#x27;s torso and is finally followed by an immediate retraction and return to one&#x27;s original fighting position. A perfect technique should also include a shout (kiai).

Each team has a team leader. The task of this leader is to draw up the team&#x27;s tactics, and based on this to choose the appropriate fighter for each round.

Team training adds variety to one&#x27;s regular training. Competing together truly is a part of the art&#x27;s appeal. The team to win more individual bouts wins the game.

=== Dantai hokei ===
Not many may consider Taido a team sport, although training together is a key part of the art&#x27;s appeal. Team hokei is a movement set performed by five competitors at the same time, in as unison as possible.

The intensive training will forge the team a strong and united one. Competitors attempt to maintain their formation from the very beginning as coherently as possible. The movement set must remain within the limits of the area.

The ultimate aim of the team is a performance in perfect unison. The rhythm and breathing in the set can be altered. Also, additional points can be awarded for more difficult techniques not found in the original basic set, such as somersaults.

Grading in team hokei involves, amongst other things, the maintaining of the formation, simultaneousness of the techniques and creativity. Also important are the general impression and the harmony of the set. All of the referees will score the whole hokei, and individual performances within will not be scored separately. The team with the highest score wins. In a tie situation, the head judge&#x27;s points will determine the winner.

Team training adds variety to one&#x27;s regular training. It also develops team spirit amongst the various trainers.

=== Tenkai ===
Tenkai is a prearranged and choreographed, from 25 to 30 seconds long “fight”, in which five persons (wakiyaku) will attack a single central &quot;hero&quot; fighter (shuyaku).

In tenkai both creativity and three-dimensionality are best brought to the stage. The group will design the fight together, which only adds to the team spirit. The timing of the techniques is crucial for the entire fight, and thus merit careful design and much practice. Tenkai thus gives one the opportunity to fully employ the large technique and movement repertoire in taido and also to utilize moves rarely seen in a normal match.

The developer of taido created these team sports to supplement the single ones, since he wanted to emphasize interactivity and sociability amongst the practitioners.

The criteria for points in tenkai include i.a. moving, usage of distance and space, three-dimensionality in both offence and defence, the difficulty of the techniques and the realism and feasibility of the attacks. The central “hero’s” performance will also be graded with regards to the moves used to finish the tenkai and five attackers. Altogether five judges will be evaluating the activities of the contestants. Furthermore, the main judge will observe the central man and the performance as a whole. The central man must win all the five attackers each at a time. Should the total time either exceed or fall short of the parameters, points will be deducted.

==International spread==
Taidō is practiced in Japan, Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and the United States.

There are an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Taidoka worldwide, most of them in Japan. In Europe, Finland and Sweden are the countries with the most athletes. The world association, the World Taido Federation, was founded in 1985.

===In Finland===
Taido first arrived in Finland in Lahti in 1972. It was brought by the Japanese student Minoru Okanda, 2nd dan. He appeared at the Sugata judo exercises in Lahti, after which he asked if people there would like to start practising a new sport.

The first Taidoka were the Judoka of the Lahti Sugata, who were impressed by Okanda&#x27;s powerful technique and fast movement. Taido was started to be practiced under Genseidojo, which was the Taido section of Lahti Sugata.

The Suomen Taidoliitto (Finnish Taido Association) was founded in 1981, and it operated as the umbrella organization of all Finnish art clubs until 31 December 2013. Since 2011, the Finnish Taido Association was first a member of the Finnish Karate Association, and on 31 December 2013, after the dissolution of the Finnish Taido Association, its member clubs became directly members of the Karate Association as of 1 January 2014. Since then, the former arts association has formed an arts college in the Finnish Karate Association. Taido&#x27;s sports college acts as a link between all Finnish Taido clubs and as an advocate for the sport in Finland and is called :fi:Suomen Taido.

===In Sweden===
Taido came to Sweden and outside Japan via Kauko Korhonen who founded the club Taidokan in Stenungsund, which was the first in Sweden/Europe. In Sweden, Taido is organized through the Swedish Budo and Martial Arts Association.

=== In the United States ===
According to American Taido Association, the presence of Taido in United States is extremely limited, with merely a single dojo situated in Peachtree Corners, Georgia. However, the association is aiming to expand in the future.

Multiple university clubs, all acting as branches of the dojo in Peachtree Corners, exist in the Southeastern United States, including at the University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Mississippi State University. Occasional Taido seminars are taught through the Dartmouth Japan Society at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Fort Lauderdale, Florida once hosted a branch of the Peachtree Corners dojo, but is now defunct.

===Elsewhere===
In Germany, since October 2011 there is an association in Lübeck (Uni-Dojo Zanshin Lübeck).

Taido was established in Norway in 2009. Currently, Halden Taido Club is the only club in Norway.

Australia haa Taido clubs in UNSW Sydney and Victoria University Melbourne.

Great Britain too is currently limited to a single dojo situated in Exeter.

==Other==

Taidō is unrelated to Shintaido. Taidō is also unrelated to &quot;Taido&quot; (read by some as &#x27;futoudo&#x27;).

Shojo Manga (Keep Your Eyes Open) is centered on the martial art of Taido.

Yutaka Ozaki studied Taido in his childhood. Novelist Hideo Yokoyama also belonged to Taido Club during his college years. Finnish MMA fighter studied Taido in his youth.

On November 12, 2023, Bandai Namco revealed a new character for the upcoming &quot;Tekken 8&quot;, Reina, whose fighting style is based on Taido. Bandai Namco collaborated with renowned Taido expert Tetsuji Nakano (中野 哲爾), four-time winner of the Taido World Championships, during the design and animation phase of Reina&#x27;s moveset.

<doc id="1215598" wikidata="Q6987389" url="?curid=1215598" title="Negligent infliction of emotional distress">
<text>The tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) is a controversial cause of action, which is available in nearly all U.S. states but is severely constrained and limited in the majority of them. The underlying concept is that one has a legal duty to use reasonable care to avoid causing emotional distress to another individual. If one fails in this duty and unreasonably causes emotional distress to another person, that actor will be liable for monetary damages to the injured individual. The tort is to be contrasted with intentional infliction of emotional distress in that there is no need to prove intent to inflict distress. That is, an accidental infliction, if negligent, is sufficient to support a cause of action.

==History==

NIED began to develop in the late nineteenth century, but only in a very limited form, in the sense that plaintiffs could recover for consequential emotional distress as a component of damages when a defendant negligently inflicted physical harm upon them. By 1908, most industrial U.S. states had adopted the &quot;physical impact&quot; form of NIED. However, NIED started developing into its more mature and more controversial form in the mid-20th century, as the new machines of the Second Industrial Revolution flooded the legal system with all kinds of previously unimaginable complex factual scenarios. Courts began to allow plaintiffs to recover for emotional distress resulting from negligent physical injuries to not only themselves, but other persons with whom they had a special relationship, like a relative. The first step, then, was to remove the requirement of physical injury to the actual plaintiff while keeping the requirement of physical injury to &quot;someone.&quot; In the 1968 landmark decision of &quot;Dillon v. Legg&quot;, the Supreme Court of California was the first court to allow recovery for emotional distress aloneeven in the absence of any physical injury to the plaintiffin the particular situation where the plaintiff simply witnessed the death of a close relative at a distance, and was not within the &quot;zone of danger&quot; where the relative was killed. A 2007 statistical study commissioned by the Court found that &quot;Dillon&quot; was the most persuasive decision published by the Court between 1940 and 2005; &quot;Dillon&quot; has been favorably cited and followed by at least twenty reported out-of-state appellate decisions, more than any other California appellate decision.

The next step after &quot;Dillon&quot; was to make optional the element of another person (so that the injury could be to &quot;anything&quot; where it would be reasonably foreseeable that such injury would cause some person emotional distress). The first such case was &quot;Rodrigues v. State&quot;, in which the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that plaintiffs could recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of negligently caused flood damage to their home. This is generally considered to be the true birth of NIED as a separate tort.

Twelve years after &quot;Dillon&quot;, California expanded NIED again, by holding that a relative could recover even where the underlying physical injury was &quot;de minimis&quot; (unnecessary medications and medical tests) if the outcome was foreseeable (the breakup of the plaintiffs&#x27; marriage as a result of the defendants&#x27; negligent and incorrect diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease).

In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time recognized NIED as part of federal common law, by holding that railroad workers could pursue NIED claims against their employers under the Federal Employers Liability Act. The Court recognized only the pre-&quot;Dillon&quot; form of NIED, though, in that the plaintiff had to be within a zone of danger to recover in the absence of physical injury. 

In 1999, Hawaii took NIED even further by expressly holding that &quot;damages may be based solely upon serious emotional distress, even absent proof of a predicate physical injury.&quot;

==Criticism==

It is generally disfavored by most states because it appears to have no definable parameters and because so many potential claims can be made under it. The situations that would give rise to such a claim are difficult to define. Because of this substantial uncertainty, most legal theorists find the theory to be unworkable in practice. 

A corollary of this critique is that the tort runs the risk (in the bystander NIED context) of overcompensating plaintiffs for distress which would have occurred anyway &quot;regardless&quot; of the cause of death of the decedent. In a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of California which severely limited the availability of bystander NIED, Associate Justice David Eagleson wrote in &quot;Thing v. La Chusa&quot;, 48 Cal. 3d 644 (1989): 

An additional criticism of the tort is that it leads to abuse of liability insurance coverage. Most liability insurance policies provide for coverage of negligently inflicted injuries but exclude coverage of intentionally inflicted injuries. If a victim is intentionally injured by a person, many theorists perceive that the victim will tend to recast the claim as being one for negligence in order to fall within the coverage of the insurance policy.

The Texas case of &quot;Boyles v. Kerr&quot;, 855 S.W.2d 593 (Tex. 1993) is illustrative. In this case, the defendant secretly videotaped himself engaging in sexual activities with the plaintiff. The defendant then showed this videotape to numerous individuals and caused severe distress to the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant, asserting a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Texas observed that the facts did not support a claim of negligence. Rather, the Court noted, the facts clearly supported a claim of an intentional injury by the defendant and it was evident that the claim had been cast as &quot;negligence&quot; solely to obtain insurance coverage. The Court then went on to hold that Texas did not recognize a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and the case to the trial court for consideration of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. 

Jurisdictions that have rejected the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress do not forbid the recovery of damages for mental injuries. Instead, these jurisdictions usually allow recovery for emotional distress where such distress:
# is inflicted intentionally (i.e., intentional infliction of emotional distress)
# is directly associated with a physical injury negligently inflicted upon a victim (e.g., emotional distress resulting from a loss of limb or disfigurement of the face)
# is caused by defamation and libel;
# stems from witnessing a accident as a bystander
# is the product of some misconduct universally recognized as causing emotional distress such as mishandling a loved one&#x27;s corpse or failing to deliver a death notice in a timely manner.

<text>Phantoms is the third studio album by the English new wave band the Fixx, released in 1984 by MCA Records.

It contains the American hit &quot;Are We Ourselves?&quot;, which reached No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the fall of 1984. The song hit No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Album Rock Tracks chart, staying at the summit for several weeks. It was also assisted by a popular MTV music video. The album&#x27;s cover art was provided by George Underwood, who had also provided artwork for the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Reach the Beach&quot; (1983), and went on to illustrate future Fixx releases including &quot;Calm Animals&quot; (1989) and &quot;Beautiful Friction&quot; (2012).

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; considered the album to be &quot;interesting only as a matter of nostalgia.&quot;

<doc id="1215616" wikidata="Q186463" url="?curid=1215616" title="16 Cygni">
<text>16 Cygni or 16 Cyg is a triple star system approximately 69 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. It consists of two Sun-like yellow dwarf stars, 16 Cygni A and 16 Cygni B, together with a red dwarf, 16 Cygni C. In 1996 an extrasolar planet was discovered in an eccentric orbit around 16 Cygni B.

==Distance==
The parallax of the two brightest stars were measured as part of the Hipparcos astrometry mission. This yielded a parallax of 47.44 milliarcseconds for 16 Cygni A and 47.14 milliarcseconds for 16 Cygni B. Since the two components are associated, it is reasonable to assume they lie at the same distance, so the different parallaxes are a result of experimental error (indeed, when the associated parallax errors are taken into account, the ranges of the parallaxes overlap). Using the parallax of the A component, the distance is 21.1 parsecs. The parallax of the B component corresponds to a distance of 21.2 parsecs.

==Stellar components==
16 Cygni is a hierarchical triple system. Stars A and C form a close binary with a projected separation of 73 AU. The orbital elements of the A–C binary are currently unknown. At a distance of 860 AU from A is a third component designated 16 Cygni B. The orbit of B relative to the A–C pair was determined in 1999 and not updated since (as of June 2007): plausible orbits range in period from 18,200 to 1.3 million years, with a semimajor axis ranging from 877 to 15,180 AU. In addition B orbits between 100 and 160 degrees inclination, that is against the A–C pole such that 90 degrees would be ecliptical.

Both 16 Cygni A and 16 Cygni B are yellow dwarf stars similar to the Sun. Their spectral types have been given as G1.5V and G3V, with A being a little hotter than the Sun, and B somewhat cooler. The system was within the field of view of the original mission of the &quot;Kepler&quot; spacecraft, which collected extremely precise photometric data of the stars. From these measurements, asteroseismology models have calculated precise masses of 1.08 and 1.04 times the solar mass for 16 Cygni A and 16 Cygni B respectively, and independent ages of around 7 billion years for each star. The system has also been observed through interferometry, which allowed the determination of the angular diameter of each star. The angular diameters together with the asteroseismology models were used to calculate radii of 1.229 and 1.116 times the solar radius for components A and B respectively.

===Abundances===
Despite having the same age and presumably the same primordial composition, observations show a small difference in the metallicity of the two 16 Cygni stars. The primary star has an iron abundance of 1.26 times the solar value, compared to 1.13 for the secondary star. A similar trend has been found for all other metals, with the primary component having an average of 10% more metals than B. One possibility is that this difference is linked to the planet 16 Cygni Bb, since its formation may have removed metals from the protoplanetary disk around 16 Cygni B. However, another study found no difference in heavy element abundances between 16 Cygni A and B.

Another chemical peculiarity between the stars is in their lithium abundance. Measurements of the lithium abundance in the system show a 4 times higher abundance in component A than in 16 Cygni B. Compared to the Sun, 16 Cygni A has 1.66 as much lithium, while 16 Cygni B has only 0.35. It has been hypothesized that the accretion of about 1 Earth mass of metals by 16 Cygni B soon after the system&#x27;s formation may have destroyed the lithium in the star&#x27;s atmosphere. Another proposed scenario is the engulfment of a Jupiter-mass planet by 16 Cygni A, which increased the amount of lithium in the star&#x27;s outer atmosphere.

==Planetary system==
In 1996 an extrasolar planet in an eccentric orbit was announced around the star 16 Cygni B. The discovery by the radial velocity method was made from independent observations from the McDonald Observatory and Lick Observatory. The planet&#x27;s orbit takes 799.5 days to complete, with a semimajor axis of 1.69 AU. It has a very high eccentricity of 0.69, which might be the result of gravitational perturbations from 16 Cygni A. In particular, simulations show the planet&#x27;s eccentricity oscillates between low and high values in timescales of tens of millions of years.

Like the majority of extrasolar planets detectable from Earth, 16 Cygni Bb was deduced from the radial velocity of its parent star. At the time that only gave a lower limit on the mass: in this case, about 1.68 times that of Jupiter. In 2012, two astronomers, E. Plavalova and N.A. Solovaya, showed that the stable orbit would demand about 2.38 Jupiter masses, such that its orbit was inclined at either 45° or 135°.

The eccentric orbit and mass of 16 Cygni Bb makes it extremely unlikely that a terrestrial sized planet will be found orbiting within the star&#x27;s habitable zone. In a computer simulation, only particles inside approximately 0.3 AU remained stable within a million years of formation, leaving open the possibility of short-period planets. For them, observation rules out any such planet of over a Neptune mass.

There was a METI message sent to the 16 Cygni system. It was transmitted from Eurasia&#x27;s largest radar—the 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The message was named Cosmic Call 1; it was sent on May 24, 1999, and it will reach 16 Cygni in November 2069.

<text>Capitol Technology University (formerly Capitol College) is a private university in South Laurel, Maryland, near Washington, DC. The university was founded in 1927 as the Capitol Radio Engineering Institute by a former US Navy Radioman. CREI changed its name to Capitol Institute of Technology in 1964, changed its name again to Capitol College in 1987, and Capitol Technology University in 2014. Capitol offers undergraduate and graduate programs specializing in engineering, computer science, information technology, and business. It is classified among &quot;D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities&quot; and is a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education.

==History==

===Capitol Radio Engineering Institute===
Capitol Technology University was founded in 1927 as the Capitol Radio Engineering Institute, a correspondence school, by Eugene H. Rietzke, a United States Navy veteran Radioman (Master Chief). Five years later, in 1932, a residence division was opened, allowing students to reside at the school and study in laboratories. This facility remained at the corner of 16th Street NW and Park Road in Washington, D.C. for 30 years. In 1946, following World War II, the institute was accredited by the Engineers&#x27; Council for Professional Development (ECPD), which is now ABET, Inc.

In 1964, it sold its correspondence school division (which comprised 20% of its business) and the Capitol Radio Engineering Institute name, to McGraw-Hill Continuing Education Center. The residential school took the name Capitol Institute of Technology.

===Capitol Institute of Technology===
In 1964, the Institute changed its name to the Capitol Institute of Technology to reflect its expansion during the 1950s. That same year, it sold its correspondence school division, which comprised 20% of its business, to McGraw-Hill Education. Shortly thereafter, in 1966, the District of Columbia licensed the institute to award Bachelor of Science degrees in engineering technology. Anticipating the need for more space, the Institute decided to move to a leased facility in Kensington, Maryland, in 1969, which opened in January 1970. Six years later, in 1976, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) awarded full accreditation to the institute.

After receiving regional accreditation, the Institute started to receive Federal and State grants for the purchase and construction of a new campus at the site of the former Beltsville Speedway (a.k.a. Baltimore-Washington Speedway), selected in 1980 and completed in September 1983. Over the next few years, new degree programs were introduced, the cooperative education program was expanded, new construction was well underway, and The Decade of Growth Campaign exceeded its $3.5 million goal. In 1986, Telecommunications Hall and the 340-seat Avrum Gudelsky Memorial Auditorium were completed.

===Capitol College===
A year later, in 1987, the Board of Trustees approved an extensive Five-Point Plan. This plan involved changing the school&#x27;s name to Capitol College, developing new curricula in electrical engineering and telecommunications, creating student housing on campus, and moving from a quarter system to a semester system. In January 1989, six apartment-style residence halls were completed, named after various inventors: Bell, De Forest, Edison, Franklin, Morse, and Steinmetz. In August 1990, the Graduate School was created to offer the college&#x27;s first Master&#x27;s degrees in systems management, similar to a degree offered at the time by the U.S.C. Institute of Safety and Systems Management..

Over the following seven years, the college expanded its graduate degree offerings, partnered with NASA to offer preparatory summer courses in engineering for minority students, developed a Distance Learning Center, and opened the renovated Puente Library, also housing the McGowan Center for Innovative Teaching. In 1997, the college offered its first courses online over the Internet. Since then, new undergraduate and graduate programs have been introduced, the Space Operations Institute was established and expanded, the McGowan Academic Center was constructed, and enrollment has increased.

In 2003, Capitol was designated a National Security Agency Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education.

===Capitol Technology University===
In 2010, Capitol launched its first doctoral degree program. The Doctor of Science (Sc.D. or DSc) in Cybersecurity is offered using a combination of live online and on-campus residency courses to students around the world, and is designed for professionals employed full-time who are seeking an education that will allow them to perform as senior leaders, program developers and policy makers in the cybersecurity field. Students attend three residencies at the Laurel campus throughout the program. The university also has several doctoral programs including Ph.D.s in Technology, Manufacturing, Construction Science, Occupational Health &amp; Safety, and Aviation.

In mid-2014, the institution was redesignated a university by the state of Maryland and changed its name to Capitol Technology University.

, Dr. Bradford L. Sims is the university&#x27;s eighth president.

==Academics==
Capitol offers numerous undergraduate and graduate degree programs as Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Doctor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Astronautical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering programs are accredited by ABET.

<text>Trawsfynydd (; Welsh for ) is a linear village in Gwynedd, Wales, near Llyn Trawsfynydd reservoir, and adjacent to the A470 north of Bronaber and Dolgellau and 10 km (6 miles) south of Blaenau Ffestiniog. It also neighbours the towns of Porthmadog and Bala.

The total community area is 12,010 hectares (46.4 square miles) with a population of only 973. The area is sparsely populated with each hectare (acre) inhabited by an average 0.07 (0.03) persons. The community includes the sub-regions of Bronaber, Cwm Prysor and Abergeirw, in addition to the village itself.

Within the village, more than 81% population are fluent Welsh speakers; it is one of the top five Welsh-speaking communities in Gwynedd.

==History==

Prehistoric people lived in the area in scattered groups of circular huts near the river, Afon Crawcwellt, about two miles south of today&#x27;s village. A substantial Romano-British fort and settlement was established at Tomen y Mur in the first century CE. The area continued to be inhabited during sub Roman Britain. An example of activity is the Trawsfynydd tankard, a late Iron Age jug used to drink mead and beer between 100BC and 75AD.
By the early medieval period, the village was part of a large Celtic Christian parish of the three settlements of Trawsfynydd, Prysor, and Cefn Clawdd. Trawsfynydd parish church is dedicated to St Madryn. Although the medieval church was badly damaged by fire in 1978 (re-opened 1981), it remains the only listed building in the village.

Records in the Meirionnydd Lay Subsidy Rolls show that following the English conquest of Wales there were 105 taxpayers in the parish in 1292–3. Throughout the next centuries, agriculture and mineral extraction (such as quarrying) remained the main economic focus of the area.

In the late 16th century, the parish of Trawsfynydd was home to Saint John Roberts, one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales (he was canonised in 1970). Roberts, who was baptised in the church, gained great respect helping those with the plague in London. However, he was found guilty of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on 10 December 1610.

By the mid 17th century, the parish of Trawsfynydd had grown to roughly 300 houses and cottages with a population of 1200, although there only 12 properties and a church in Trawsfynydd itself. Due to the economic hardship in the area, Trawsfynydd would remain quite small until the British Army established a training area near the village in 1930. Between 1924 and 1928, a large man-made reservoir named Llyn Trawsfynydd was created to supply water for Maentwrog hydro-electric power station. This would lead to the largest change to the village, when a location nearby was chosen as a site for one of the UK&#x27;s first nuclear power stations in the 1950s.

===Military training area ===
Before the Second World War, the War Office opened a site at Bronaber near Trawsfynydd as an artillery range and training area. Its continued use for training exercises after the war was the subject of protest by Plaid Cymru, who also challenged the UK government&#x27;s continued military conscription in peacetime.

=== Trawsfynydd nuclear power stations===

In 1965 the new power station was completed. It was capable of supplying the whole of North Wales&#x27; electricity needs. The lake was subsequently also used to supply cooling water to the twin reactor Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, which was used for the commercial generation of electricity for the UK national grid. It also became the biggest employer in the area which brought financial wealth to the village.

One of the four original dams built to create the lake was subsequently rebuilt after construction of the nuclear power plant. Whereas previously the Maentwrog power station had access to all of the water in the lake, the needs of the nuclear plant dictated that from then on, the hydro plant should only use the top five feet of water.

In the 1990s the site was closed. Decommissioning is expected to take until 2083.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes the community of Maentwrog and Gellilydan and has a total population of 1,604.

==Transport==
===Railways===
Trawsfynydd used to be served by a section of the Great Western Railway branch line, which ran from Bala to Blaenau Ffestiniog. To the north of the station, the army built its own station to serve the large camp nearby.(camp detail) Today Trawsfynydd railway station is a private home. (pictures). The line closed to all traffic in 1961, and the trackbed at the Bala end was subsequently severed by the Llyn Celyn reservoir, but the section between Blaenau and Trawsfynydd Power Station reopened in 1964 for nuclear flask traffic. Access from the Bala end being no longer possible, a new section of track – the so-called &quot;Trawsfynydd Link&quot; – was constructed to link the previously separate ex-GWR and ex-LNWR stations in Blaenau Ffestiniog. It finally closed in 1998, although the track remains in situ.

===Road===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries a turnpike was built that ran through the village. With the advent of motor transport, this became the A470 in the 1920s. Between 1963 and 1965, a bypass was built around the village for through traffic.

==In popular culture==
In 1976 the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation production &quot;One Hour to Zero&quot; was filmed in the village and at the nearby power station. The film &quot;First Knight&#x27; (1995)&#x27; had scenes filmed around Llyn Trawsfynydd.

==Notable people==
=== Hedd Wyn ===
Trawsfynydd was the home of the Welsh bard Hedd Wyn (1887–1917), who died during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, six weeks before his poem won the Bard&#x27;s Chair at that year&#x27;s National Eisteddfod. It was sent to his parents in the village draped in a black cloth. &quot;Y Gadair Ddu&quot; (The Black Chair) is now on display at his home farm &quot;Yr Ysgwrn&quot;. A statue of him by Leonard Stanford Merrifield, unveiled in 1924, stands in the main street of Trawsfynydd. Hedd Wyn is buried with others from his regiment, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, at Artillery Wood Cemetery, Boezinge in Flanders. The film &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; (1992) was filmed in and around Trawsfynydd.

<text>The Titanium Man is the name of two supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The original Titanium Man first appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #69 (September 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck.

==Fictional character biography==

===Boris Bullski===
Boris Bullski was born in Makiivka, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. According to the Black Widow, he was a KGB member when he was a young man, and she was his combat instructor for a time. An ambitious official of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Bullski was demoted after displeasing his superiors.

While working as an administrator of a Siberian labor camp, he commissioned the imprisoned scientists at the camp to build a suit of armor using the lab of Anton Vanko, the creator of the original Crimson Dynamo armor. Seeking to win back the Party&#x27;s favor, Bullski conceived the idea of winning a propaganda victory against the West by defeating the American superhero Iron Man. He assigned the scientists to create a powerful suit of titanium armor based on Iron Man&#x27;s technology, though the inferior resources available to the scientists meant that the armor was twice the size of Iron Man&#x27;s. Bullski received permission to issue his challenge, and Iron Man accepted, defeating Titanium Man in a battle before a worldwide television audience.

Undaunted, Bullski prepared for a rematch. The suit was redesigned, and he underwent medical treatments that increased his size and strength. Traveling to the US, Bullski fought Iron Man in the skies above Washington, D.C., but was defeated. Withdrawing for retrieval by a Soviet submarine, he discovered that he had been abandoned on orders from Moscow. 

Bullski worked for the Vietnamese Communist scientist Half-Face (who increased his power yet again). Then, he returned to the service of the Government of the Soviet Union and was dispatched to the US to retrieve the third Crimson Dynamo, whom he found at Cord Industries. A three-way battle between Titanium Man, Crimson Dynamo, and Iron Man began, during which Titanium Man killed Janice Cord with an electronic beam. Enraged, Iron Man soundly defeated Titanium Man and left him in the murky depths of the Hudson River.

After the defeat, the two disgraced Soviet agents fled to Communist-controlled Vietnam, where they joined with Radioactive Man to form the Titanic Three. Though Bullski enjoyed working as a sanctioned agent once again, he longed to return to the Soviet Union, and devised a new plan to win his superiors&#x27; favor. Adopting the alias The Other, he dispatched another former Soviet agent, Unicorn, to destroy Iron Man. When Unicorn failed, Titanium Man attempted to destroy Iron Man, but he failed again.

Despite his failures, Bullski was in favor with the Soviet government, and he returned to the US on a mission for the KGB. By threatening the parents of a Soviet defector named Sergei, he forced the man to design technologically advanced armored suits that could be transformed into small card-like objects. Posing as &quot;the Commander&quot;, Bullski used the suits to equip members of the Green Liberation Front (G.L.F.), an organization of disaffected Vietnam War veterans who felt ignored by their country. With the suits, the G.L.F. robbed a New York City bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; though the members believed that they were simply acting as thieves, Bullski used the robberies as a cover for implanting a computer virus that would destroy American financial records, causing chaos in the economy of the United States. Beta Ray Bill and Sif opposed the G.L.F. and the Commander, but when Sergei discovered that his parents were dead he exposed Bullski&#x27;s true identity and the angry members of the G.L.F. turned on the Titanium Man. Teleporting away, he rematerialized in card form, which Sergei then simply tore and threw away.

Sometime later, the new Crimson Dynamo was sent to the US by the Soviet government to retrieve the remnants for reintegration. The G.L.F. discovered the Crimson Dynamo&#x27;s mission and attacked him, forcing him to seek assistance by reactivating the Titanium Man, who due to the incomplete nature of his reassembly was still missing body parts. Enraged, Bullski slaughtered the members of the G.L.F., and was only stopped when the Dynamo lured him over the Atlantic Ocean and returned him to card form. Bullski was later restored and continued to serve as Titanium Man, as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers and later Remont-4, but felt increasingly despondent as the Soviet Union declined. After an attack on a Stark Enterprises factory in Russia, he was believed killed while battling Tony Stark, who was wearing Crimson Dynamo armor that was being controlled by Colonel General Valentin Shatalov, a former friend of Bullski.

Sometime later, during a space mission to destroy an enormous asteroid that threatened to impact on Earth, a Titanium Man initially claimed his name was Andy Stockwell and had never had a connection with the USSR. (The name was an alias for Bullski.) Moments later, it was revealed he was a member of The Hammer, an international network of communist sleeper cells who wanted to destroy the US. He was lost in space, but being relatively close to Earth, may have returned under his own power.

Later, as a mercenary, Bullski was hired by Tony Stark to fake an attack on Congress trying to show reasons to stop the Superhuman Registration Act. He battled Spider-Man there and made a withdrawal after Spider-Man damaged his helmet with his cybernetic claws, but not without saying to a camera in Spider-Man&#x27;s Iron Spider suit a planned talk which Stark used in the Congress in rejection of the SRA.

Titanium Man reappeared subsequently in Russia as a member of the rogue Soviet super-rebel group called Remont Six. He was knocked out by Darkstar but was apparently not captured. Later, Titanium Man was seen being beaten down by the Protector. The identity of this Titanium Man or the circumstances of the battle remain undisclosed, but he is presumably Bullski, because he was wearing that version of the armor.

Doctor Octopus&#x27;s scheme during &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot;, included contacting Titanium Man as one of several villains to assist in his plans after two of the Sinister Six were defeated, but this backfired when the Titanium Man contacted the Black Widow to warn her about the scheme. He characterized himself as a Russian patriot rather than an American villain, and he answered Spider-Man&#x27;s call to rally others against Doctor Octopus. When Titanium Man entered one of Doctor Octopus&#x27; facilities, he was defeated by Scorpion despite his best efforts.

===Kondrati Topolov===

The second version was Kondrati Topolov, the mutant formerly known as Gremlin, and served with the Soviet-era superhero group, the Soviet Super-Soldiers. He was killed in combat with Iron Man during the first &quot;Armor Wars&quot; when the titanium in the suit exceeded its combustible temperature.

===Third version===
The third version&#x27;s identity is the subject of some controversy. The first time this figure manifested itself, he attacked Stark Enterprises and Iron Man directly, apparently under orders of Stark-Fujikawa (possibly as a mercenary). While he was shown to cherish Soviet paraphernalia and newspaper clippings featuring Boris Bullski, his identity was not firmly established.

Sometime later, during a space mission to destroy an enormous asteroid that threatened to impact on Earth, a Titanium Man, claiming to be this same person, stated his name was Andy Stockwell, and had never had a connection with the USSR. However, moments later it was revealed he was actually a member of &quot;The Hammer&quot;, an international network of communist sleeper cells who wanted to destroy the United States. He was lost in space, but being relatively close to Earth, may have returned under his own power.

===Gennedy Ovinnik===
Another version was introduced under the name Gennedy Ovinnik. Ovinnik, a Corporal in the Russian Military, 58th Army, North Caucasus District, was sent as an agent of the Russian Government along with Crimson Dynamo to defend Russian interest in Transia. The two were quickly overwhelmed by an army of Iron Man Armors controlled by the Zmaj only to be saved by Iron Man and Radioactive Man. 

===Other Titanium Men===

A Titanium Man was contacted and hired, ostensibly through the Hammer again, to do a mercenary job for Tony Stark in his effort to stop the superhuman registration bill.

In the same period, another Titanium Man was seen being beaten down by Noh-Varr. The identity of this Titanium Man or the circumstances of the battle remain undisclosed.

A Titanium Man was among Iron Man&#x27;s villains recruited by Mandarin and Zeke Stane to assist in a plot to take down Iron Man.

During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, a Titanium Man is among the villains recruited by Spymaster to help him attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower. Titanium Man attacks Blizzard and Whirlwind when they try to abandon the mission. During the fight, it is revealed that Titanium Man is the Kree Captain At-Lass who was sent by the Kree to steal Iron Man&#x27;s armor.

==Powers and abilities==
The Titanium Men used green armor similar to that used by Iron Man and to that used by the Crimson Dynamo (their sometime compatriot). Neither suit of armor was as sophisticated as that used by Tony Stark as Iron Man, but some of its weapons were deceptively powerful, and the first Titanium Man&#x27;s physical strength seems to have been greater than that of Iron Man. He also boasted that his armor was made to last, not, like American technology, &quot;with planned obsolescence&quot; (although he had actually received several significant upgrades himself).

The suit of armor increases the wearer&#x27;s physical strength to superhuman levels, and is in fact stronger than Iron Man. It was also able to fly at supersonic speeds (it can even reach escape velocity), shoot concussive force blasts from the hands, project constrictive force &quot;rings&quot;, fire an electromagnetically paralytic beam from the helmet, and was resistant to conventional artillery.

Boris Bullski, the original Titanium Man, also possessed enhanced strength due to treatments given to him by the Soviet government to augment his physiology, making him grow into an -tall giant. The Gremlin, being a dwarf who seldom exercised, was weaker than most people, but he possessed superhuman intelligence, was capable of creating advanced devices and weapons, and was an accomplished genetic engineer.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel universe has the mastermind of &quot;Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars&quot; as Howard Stark Sr. in a human/machine armor that resembles Titanium Man with some elements of Iron Monger.

<text>Benjamin Joseph Scotti (born June 9, 1937) is a former producer and former American football defensive back in the National Football League (NFL). A graduate of the University of Maryland (1959), Scotti played for the Washington Redskins (1959–1961), the Philadelphia Eagles (1962–1963), and the San Francisco 49ers (1964). In late November 1963, Scotti received brief national attention when he precipitated a fight with teammate John Mellekas that sent Mellekas to the hospital. He is the brother of media mogul Tony Scotti, with whom he co-produced a few television programs, most notably the lifeguard drama &quot;Baywatch&quot;, and also co-founded the Scotti Bros. record label which released music by artists such as Leif Garrett, Survivor and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic until the label was dissolved in the mid-1990s. He went on to form Banders.

<text>See for Miles Records (SFM) was a British record label that specialised in reissuing rock classics. It was one of the first British re-issue specialists predating the emergence of compact discs.

See for Miles reissued &quot;oldies&quot;, including most of the records of many labels such as Dandelion Records on CD in the 1990s. The label reissued 56 Ventures albums on 28 CDs.

== Operations ==
The name hints both to its co-owner Colin Miles and The Who&#x27;s &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;. 

Rye joined See for Miles just as CDs were becoming popular, and started Magpie as its authorised mail-order company, in 1990. He had previously worked with Colin Miles at EMI. One of his business partners was Steve Waters.

== Legacy ==
The company went into administration and in 2007 the label rights were sold to Phoenix Music International.

Rye and Waters went on to work on the Rockhistory.co.uk series, filming British Invasion bands, and issuing a CD series called Extended Play.

<text>Samuel Henry Kress (July 23, 1863 – September 22, 1955) was a businessman, philanthropist, and founder of the S. H. Kress &amp; Co. five and ten cent store chain. With his fortune, Kress amassed one of the most significant collections of Italian Renaissance and European artwork assembled in the 20th century. In the 1950s and 1960s, a foundation established by Kress would donate 776 works of art from the Kress collection to 18 regional art museums in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Kress was born in Cherryville, Pennsylvania, near Allentown, the second of seven children born to John Franklin Kress and Margaret Dodson (née Conner) Kress. His father was a retail merchant. His siblings were Mary Conner Kress, Jennie Weston Kress, Palmer John Kress, Claude Washington Kress, and Rush Harrison Kress. Another sibling, Elmer Kress, died ten days after birth. Kress never married or had children. He was a Mason.

Young Kress attended schools in Slatington, Pennsylvania.

==Career==
Kress worked for a while in the stone quarries. He earned his teaching credentials by age 17 and began work as a schoolteacher in Emerald, Pennsylvania. His first position was instructor for a class of 80 students, and he was paid $25 per month. He walked 3 miles each way to the schoolhouse.

In 1887, Kress opened a stationery and notions store in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. As the business prospered, he used his profits to open additional stores, naming his chain S. H. Kress &amp; Co. These eventually became popularly known as the Kress Five and Dime stores. Unlike many businessmen of his day who only opened their stores in large urban areas, Kress wisely located his stores in smaller cities in 29 states he felt had growth potential. These stores became the jewel of many of these cities, which only had a dry goods or general store until then. By the mid-1920s, he was living in a penthouse at 1020 Fifth Avenue in New York City, across the street from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which he visited and contributed to regularly.

==S. H. Kress &amp; Co.==


S. H. Kress &amp; Co., a chain of &quot;five and dime&quot; retail department stores, was started in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, by Samuel H. Kress in 1896. Eventually expanding to over 200 locations nationwide, Kress stores were long a familiar sight in many cities and towns of the United States. The Kress chain was known for the fine architecture of the stores, with a number of locations being hailed by architects for their design. A number of former Kress stores, now put to other uses, are ranked as landmarks. Some of the most well-known Kress locations included New York City&#x27;s Fifth Avenue; Canal Street, New Orleans; and Hollywood&#x27;s Hollywood Boulevard. In 1964 ownership of Kress was acquired by Genesco, Inc. The company abandoned its center-city stores and moved to the shopping malls. Genesco began liquidating Kress and closing down the Kress stores in 1980.

==Samuel H. Kress Foundation==
Kress was founder and president of the eponymous Samuel H. Kress Foundation. An avid art lover, he acquired, through art dealers Alesandro Contini-Bonacossi and Joseph Duveen, often with the advice of art historian William Suida, a collection of paintings and sculpture, primarily of the Italian Renaissance school. In 1929 he gave the Italian government a large sum for the restoration of a number of architectural treasures in Italy. Beginning in the 1930s Kress decided to give much of his art collection to museums across the country while he was still alive. Many paintings were donated to the same smaller cities that had brought him his fortune with their stores. In several cases, his gifts became the founding basis for museums in those areas which otherwise could never have afforded artworks of such importance and quality.

On March 17, 1941, Kress and Paul Mellon gave large gifts of art to the people of the United States, thereby establishing the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Franklin D. Roosevelt accepted the gift personally.

Today, the masterpieces Kress donated are considered priceless and the Kress Foundation has dispensed millions of dollars to worthy organizations and institutions in the years since.

== Kress Collection of Historic Images, National Gallery of Art ==
The Kress Collection of Historic Images at the National Gallery of Art—more than 18,300 scans of paintings, drawings, sculptures, and decorative arts purchased or once considered for purchase by Samuel H. Kress and the foundation he established in 1929—has been digitized, making these significant holdings more accessible to researchers around the world through the Gallery’s department of image collections. Kress donated most of these objects to 90 museums, colleges, and other institutions in 33 states, with the greater number of these gifts coming to the National Gallery of Art.
Images from this collection document works of art in various states of conservation, as well as some x-ray, infrared, and ultraviolet images. In a few cases, the files include scans of comments by scholars written on the backs of the photographs. Photographs of Samuel Kress’s apartment in New York show 282 magnificent objects as they were arranged before their dispersal.

Art historians, conservators, and students have used these images to enhance their understanding of these objects. The photographs can illuminate aspects of the works of art that we can no longer see. For instance, conservators routinely study these images in order to anticipate remnants of earlier damage or restorations. Art historians may compare high resolution details to other known works by an artist to assist in attribution questions. Students may better understand the “life” of a work of art by seeing changes over time, illustrated through a variety of reproductive processes.

The Kress Collection of Historic Images project was made possible by two generous grants by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation.

<doc id="1215674" wikidata="Q7936607" url="?curid=1215674" title="Visual memory">
<text>Visual memory describes the relationship between perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. Visual memory is a form of memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind&#x27;s eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.

== Neuroanatomy ==
In humans, areas specialized for visual object recognition in the ventral stream have a more inferior location in the temporal cortex, whereas areas specialized for the visual-spatial location of objects in the dorsal stream have a more superior location in the parietal cortex. However, these two streams hypothesis, although useful, are a simplification of the visual system because the two streams maintain intercommunication along their entire rostral course.

=== Posterior parietal cortex ===
The posterior parietal cortex is a portion of the parietal lobe, which manipulates mental images, and integrates sensory and motor portions of the brain.

A majority of experiments highlights a role of human posterior parietal cortex in visual working memory and attention. We therefore have to establish a clear separation of visual memory and attention from processes related to the planning of goal-directed motor behaviors.

We can only hold in mind a minute fraction of the visual scene. These mental representations are stored in visual short-term memory. Activity in the posterior parietal cortex is tightly correlated with the limited amount of scene information that can be stored in visual short-term memory. These results suggest that the posterior parietal cortex is a key neural locus of our impoverished mental representation of the visual world.

The posterior cortex might act as a capacity-limited store for the representation of the visual scene, the frontal/prefrontal cortex might be necessary for the consolidation and/or maintenance of this store, especially during extended retention intervals.

=== Visual cortex ===
There is a visual cortex in each hemisphere of the brain, much of which is located in the Occipital lobe. The left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals mainly from the right visual field and the right visual cortex mainly from the left visual field, although each cortex receives a considerable amount of information from the ipsilateral visual field as well. The visual cortex also receives information from subcortical regions, such as the lateral geniculate body, located in the thalamus. However, ample evidence indicates that object identity and location are preferentially processed in ventral (occipito-temporal) and dorsal (occipito-parietal) cortical visual streams, respectively.
Comparison of rCBF during performance of the two tasks again revealed differences between the ventral and dorsal pathways.

==== Dorsal stream pathway ====
The dorsal stream pathway is mainly involved in the visual-spatial location of objects in the external world, and it is also known colloquially as the &#x27;where&#x27; pathway. The dorsal stream pathway is also involved in the guidance of movements (e.g., reaching for an object in space), and is therefore implicated in the analysis of the movement of objects in addition to their spatial locations.

The dorsal stream pathway begins with purely visual information in the occipital lobe, and then this information is transferred to the parietal lobe for spatial awareness functions. Specifically, the posterior parietal cortex is essential for &quot;the perception and interpretation of spatial relationships, accurate body image, and the learning of tasks involving coordination of the body in space.&quot;

==== Ventral stream pathway ====
The ventral stream pathway is mainly involved in object recognition, and is known colloquially as the &#x27;what&#x27; pathway. It has connections to the medial temporal lobe (which is involved in the storage of long-term memories), the limbic system (which regulates emotions), and the dorsal stream pathway (which is involved in the visual-spatial locations and motions of objects). Therefore, the ventral stream pathway not only deals with the recognition of objects in the external world, but also the emotional judgement and analysis of these objects.

The ventral stream pathway begins with purely visual information in the primary visual cortex (occipital lobe), and then this information is transferred to the temporal lobe.

=== Occipital lobes ===
Located at the back of the brain, the occipital lobes receive and process visual information. The occipital lobes also process colors and shapes. Whereas the right occipital lobe interprets images from the left visual space, the left occipital lobe interprets images from the right visual space. Damage to the occipital lobes can permanently damage visual perception

==== Occipital lobe injury complications ====
Damage to the occipital lobe is characterized by loss of visual capability and the inability to identify colors both important processes in visual memory.

=== Short term visual memory ===
Visual short term memory is the capacity for holding a small amount of visual information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time (usually no more than 30 seconds). Although visual short term memory is essential for the execution of a wide array of perceptual and cognitive functions, and is supported by an extensive network of brain regions, its storage capacity is severely limited.

Visual short-term memory storage is mediated by distinctive posterior brain mechanisms, such that capacity is determined both by a fixed number of objects and by object complexity.

=== Long term visual memory ===
Recall of the patterns from long term visual memory is associated with rCBF increases in different areas of the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.
The retrieval of long term visual memories is associated with activation of both anterior and posterior temporal cortices. Posterior temporal cortical regions are more associated with retrieval of category-specific aspects of visual memory, whereas anterior regions of the temporal cortex are more associated with category-independent visual memory.

== Methods of study ==

=== Benton visual retention test ===
The Benton Visual Retention Test is an assessment of visual perception, and visual memory abilities. More than 50 years of proven clinical use is the staple of the Benton Visual Retention Test. This test has proven its sensitivity to reading disabilities, nonverbal learning disabilities, traumatic brain injury, attention-deficit disorder, alzheimer&#x27;s, and other forms of dementia. During testing participants are presented with 10 cards for 10 seconds with unique designs on each. After the time has passed participants are asked to immediately reproduce the designs from each card using their visual memory. In the second stage participants are asked to copy each of the 10 card designs while the cards are in view. The participants results from each task are then assessed and placed into six categories; omissions, distortions, preservations, rotations, misplacements, and sizing errors. The further the participant&#x27;s scores varies from the averages provided in the Benton Visual Retention Test manual the worse the participant is assessed to be on visual memory ability. The Benton Visual Retention Test has proved to be a generalizable test with the ability to be accurately administered to participants aged 8-adult, and no gender effect. Some studies have suggested a significant gender and education interaction indicating that an age-associated decline in visual memory performance may be more prominent for those individuals with a lower education level.

=== Neuroimaging tests ===
Neuroimaging studies focus on the neural networks involved in visual memory using methods designed to activate brain areas involved in encoding, storage, and recall. These studies involve the use of one or multiple types of brain imaging techniques designed to measure timing or activation within the brain. The data collected from neuroimaging studies gives researchers the ability to visualize which brain regions are activated in specific cognitive visual memory tasks. With the use of brain imaging devices researchers able to further investigate memory performance above and beyond standard tests based on exact response times, and activation.

==== Control condition ====
The subject&#x27;s resting brain activation level is first determined in order to form a control or &#x27;baseline&#x27; to measure from. Subjects are blindfolded and instructed to lay motionless while simultaneously eliminating any visual imagery present in their mind&#x27;s eye. These instructions are intended to minimize the activation of brain regions involved in visual memory to form a true resting brain state. After the scan is complete a control has been formed which can be compared with activated regions of the brain while performing visual memory tasks.

==== Activation condition ====
During encoding, participants are typically exposed to 1–10 visual patterns while connected to a brain imaging device. As the subject encodes the visual patterns researchers are able to directly view the activation of areas involved in visual memory encoding. During recall subjects again need to have all visual stimuli removed by means of a dark room or blindfolding to avoid interfering activation of other visual areas in the brain. Subjects are asked to recall each image clearly in their mind&#x27;s eye. While recalling the images researchers are able view the areas activated by the visual memory task. Comparing the control &#x27;baseline&#x27; state to the activated areas during the visual memory task allows researchers to view which areas are used during visual memory.

== Current theories ==

=== Visuo-spatial sketch pad ===
The visuo-spatial sketchpad is part of Baddeley and Hitch&#x27;s model of working memory. It is responsible for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is thought of as a three-dimensional cognitive map, which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on. It is used in tasks such as mental image manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, change of colour, etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one which you have a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of vividness is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad.

=== Eidetic and photographic memories ===
Eidetic memory is an ability to recall images, sounds, or objects in memory with high precision for a few minutes without using mnemonics. It occurs in a small number of children and generally is not found in adults.

The popular culture concept of photographic memory—where, for example, someone can briefly look at a page of text and then recite it perfectly from memory—is not the same as seeing eidetic images, and photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.

=== Iconic memory ===

Iconic memory is the visual part of the sensory memory system. Iconic memory is responsible for visual priming, because it works very quickly and unconsciously. Iconic memory decays very quickly, but contains a very vivid image of the surrounding stimuli.

=== Spatial memory ===
Spatial memory is a person&#x27;s knowledge of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, and how to get to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However, both types of memory are often used together, such as when trying to remember where you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The number of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.

=== Object memory ===

Object memory involves processing features of an object or material such as texture, color, size, and orientation. It is processed mainly in the ventral regions of the brain. A few studies have shown that on average most people can recall up to four items each with a set of four different visual qualities. It is a separate system from spatial memory and is not affected by interference from spatial tasks.

== Accuracy ==
Visual memory is not always accurate and can be misled by outside conditions. This can be seen in studies carried out by Elizabeth Loftus and Gary Wells. In one study by Wells, individuals were exposed to misleading information after witnessing an event; they were then tested on their ability to remember details from this event. Their findings included: when given misinformation that contradicts the witnessed event they were less able to recall those details; and whether misinformation was given before or after the witnessed event did not seem to matter. Furthermore, visual memory can be subjected to various memory errors which will affect accuracy.

== Visual memory in education ==
&quot;We do not store and retrieve words based on visual memory.&quot; &quot;Our phonological filing system is the basis for word memory/word recognition.&quot; -Dr. Kilpatrick (Equipped for Reading Success).

Visual memory, in an academic environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students must be able to look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.

Children who have not developed their visual memory skills cannot readily reproduce a sequence of visual stimuli. They frequently experience difficulty in remembering the overall visual appearance of words or the letter sequence of words for reading and spelling.

== Factors affecting visual memory ==

=== Sleep ===
Findings surrounding sleep and visual memory have been mixed. Studies have reported performance increases after a bout of sleep compared with the same period of waking. The implications of this are that there is a slow, offline process during sleep that strengthens and enhances the memory trace. Further studies have found that quiet rest has shown the same learning benefits as sleep. Replay has been found to occur during post-training quiet wakefulness as well as sleep. In a recent study where a visual search task was administered quiet rest or sleep is found to be necessary for increasing the amount of associations between configurations and target locations that can be learned within a day. Reactivation in sleep was only observed after extensive training of rodents on familiar tasks. It rapidly dissipates; it also makes up a small proportion of total recorded activity in sleep. 
It has also been found that there are gender differences between males and females in regards to visual memory and sleep. In a study done testing sleep and memory for pictures it was found that daytime sleep contributed to retention of source memory rather than item memory in females, females did not have recollection or familiarity influenced by daytime sleep, whereas males undergoing daytime sleep had a trend towards increased familiarity. The reasons for this may be linked to different memory traces resulting from different encoding strategies, as well as with different electrophysiological changes during daytime sleep.

=== Brain damage ===
Brain damage is another factor that has been found to have an effect on visual memory. Memory impairment affects both novel and familiar experiences. Poor memory after damage to the brain is usually considered to result from information being lost or rendered inaccessible. With such impairment it is assumed that it must be due to the incorrect interpretation of previously encountered information as being novel. In experiments testing rats&#x27; object recognition memory it was found that memory impairment can be the opposite, that there was a tendency to treat novel experiences as familiar. A possible solution for this impairment could be the use of a visual-restriction procedure that reduces interference.

=== Age ===
Studies have shown that with aging, in terms of short-term visual memory, viewing time and task complexity affect performance. When there is a delay or when the task is complex recall declines. In a study conducted to measure whether visual memory in older adults with age-related visual decline was caused by memory performance or visual functioning, the following were examined: relationships among age, visual activity, and visual and verbal memory in 89 community dwelling volunteers aged 60–87 years. The findings were that the effect of vision was not specific to visual memory. Therefore, vision was found to be correlated with general memory function in older adults and is not modality specific.

As we age performance in regards to spatial configurations deteriorates. In a task to store and combine two different spatial configurations to form a novel one young people out-performed the elderly. Vision also has an effect on performance. Sighted participants outperformed the visually impaired regardless of testing modality. This suggests that vision tends to shape the general supramodal mechanisms of memory.

=== Alcohol ===
Studies have shown that there is an effect of alcohol on visual memory. In a recent study visual working memory and its neutral correlates was assessed in university students who partake in binge drinking, the intermittent consumption of large amounts of alcohol. The findings revealed that there may be binge-drinking related functional alteration in recognition working memory processes. This suggests that impaired prefrontal cortex function may occur at an early age in binge drinkers.

Another study conducted in 2004 examined the level of response to alcohol and brain response during visual working memory. This study looked at the neural correlated of the low level of response to alcohol using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a challenging visual memory task. The results were that young people who report having needed more alcohol to feel the effects showed higher levels of brain response during visual working memory, this suggests that the individual&#x27;s capacity to adjust to cognitive processing decreases, they are less able to adjust cognitive processing to contextual demands.

== Dysfunction of visual memory ==
Hallucinatory palinopsia, which is a dysfunction of visual memory, is caused by posterior visual pathway cortical lesions and seizures, most commonly in the non-dominant parietal lobe. Focal hyperactivity causes persistent activation of a visual cortex-hippocampal neuronal circuit which encodes an object or scene that is already in visual memory. &quot;All of the hallucinatory palinopsia symptoms occur concomitantly in a patient with one lesion, which supports current evidence that objects, features, and scenes are all units of visual memory, perhaps at different levels of processing. This alludes to neuroanatomical integration in visual memory creation and storage.&quot; Studying the excitability alterations associated with palinopsia in migraineurs could provide insight on mechanisms of encoding visual memory.

One common group of people that have visual memory problems are children with reading disabilities. It was often thought that disabilities are caused by failure to perceive the letters of a written word in the right order. However, studies show it is more likely that it is caused by a failure to encode and process the correct order of letters within the word. This means that the child perceives the word just as anyone else would, however their brains do not appear to hold onto the visual characteristics of the word. Although initially it was found that children with reading disabilities had comparable visual memory to those without difficulty, a more specific part of the visual memory system has been found to cause reading disabilities.

These parts are the sustained and transient visual processing systems. The sustained system is responsible for fine detail such as word and letter recognition and is very important in encoding words in their correct order. The transient system is responsible for controlling eye movements, and processing the larger visual environment around us. When these two processes do not work in synchronization this can cause reading disabilities. This has been tested by having children with and without reading disabilities perform on tasks related to the transient systems, where the children with reading disabilities did very poorly. It has also been found in postmortem examinations of the brains of people with reading disabilities that they have fewer neurons and connections in the areas representing the transient visual systems. However, there is debate over whether this is the only reason for reading disabilities, scotopic sensitivity syndrome, deficits in verbal memory and orthographic knowledge are other proposed factors. 
Deficits in visual memory can also be caused by disease and/or trauma to the brain. These can lead to the patient losing their spatial memory, and/or their visual memory for specific things. For example, a patient “L.E.” suffered brain damage and her ability to draw from memory was severely diminished, whilst her spatial memory remained normal. Other patients represent the opposite, where memory for colors and shapes is unaffected but spatial memory for previously known places is greatly impaired. These case studies show that these two types of visual memory are located in different parts of the brain and are somewhat unrelated in terms of functioning in daily life.
