<doc id="1194208" wikidata="Q2985990" url="?curid=1194208" title="A Hill in Korea">
<text>A Hill in Korea is a 1956 British war film based on Max Catto&#x27;s 1953 novel of the same name. The original name was Hell in Korea, but it was changed for distribution reasons—except in the US. It was directed by Julian Amyes and produced by Anthony Squire. Incidental music was written by Malcolm Arnold.

It was the first major feature film to portray British troops in action during the Korean War and introduces Michael Caine (himself a veteran of the Korean War) in his first credited film role. There are also early screen appearances by Stanley Baker, Robert Shaw and Ronald Lewis.

==Plot==
During the Korean War in 1951, a small force of British soldiers is in danger of being cut off by the advancing Chinese army. The plot emphasizes the plight of the National Servicemen who, as they say, were &quot;old enough to fight, but too young to vote.&quot;

The film also depicts a &quot;Friendly-fire&quot; incident, in which the British are bombed by the Americans. (refer to Friendly-fire incident in the Battle of Hill 282)

The film opens in Korea with a British Army patrol, led by Lt. Butler. In the patrol is tough veteran Sergeant Payne, a slightly psychotic Corporal Ryker, and the cowardly signaller Wyatt. As they search a small village, one of the party falls victim to a bomb planted in a small shack. With the death of one of his men, Butler moves the patrol out of the village. Out in the open plain, Butler and Payne discover a large force of Chinese soldiers heading directly for them. Sending Payne and the patrol back towards their own lines, Butler and three of his men stay behind to cover the withdrawal. After fending off two attacks, Butler discovers Lance Corporal Hodge is dead. Payne returns with the patrol, informing Butler that they were cut off by other enemy forces.

The patrol heads through the village and up a winding path towards an isolated temple located on a hill, with only a steep cliff to its rear. On the way, Wyatt throws away the only radio because he cannot be bothered to carry it up the hill. Then they run into an enemy patrol on the path. They ambush the Chinese, and continue up to the temple. With the Chinese knowing now exactly where they are, Butler must keep his troops together, and fend off the enemy attacks.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was based on a novel by Max Catto which was published in 1954 and based on true events.

===Shooting===
The film was shot on location in Portugal and at Shepperton Studios.

Michael Caine was cast in part because of his experience in the Korean War, where he had served as a soldier. He later said, &quot;My function as a technical advisor was completely ignored during the making of the film. For example, I advised the crew to spread the troops wide as the latter advanced, which was militarily correct, but they replied that they didn&#x27;t have a lens of sufficient width to take it all in! I also pointed out that the officer would have removed his signs of rank and worn a hat, the same as the other men, to disguise which one was in command, but George [Baker] was allowed to go into battle with all badges and hat gleaming, every inch an officer. In a real fight, he would never have lasted all of ten seconds.&quot;

Caine added, &quot;The most glaring mistake that I never brought to their notice was that Portugal did not in the least resemble Korea; if anything, Wales was more similar. I did not say anything because I wanted to stay in Portugal – I could go to Wales at any old time.&quot;

Caine later recalled, &quot;I had eight lines in that picture, and I screwed up six of them.&quot;

==Release==
According to Caine, &quot;the company held on to the film for ages before releasing it. After a year of waiting for the perfect moment, with true movie genius they premiered the film on the night that we invaded Suez. The picture went straight down the pan, and my movie career along with it. I bemoaned the fact that nobody had seen the film, until I actually saw it myself. I was terrible! My voice was awful...My eyelashes are blond and so are my eyebrows, which has the effect in close-up of something speaking that hasn&#x27;t got a face, and it&#x27;s not much better in medium shot..My appearances were mercifully few, the editor having decided that the cutting-room floor was the ideal place for my first effort at international stardom.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;taut, no-nonsense&quot;.

<text>John Maurice Kelly (31 August 1931 – 24 January 1991) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism from 1981 to 1982, acting Minister for Foreign Affairs from June 1981 to October 1981, Attorney General from May 1977 to July 1977 and Government Chief Whip from 1973 to 1977. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-Central from 1973 to 1977 and for Dublin South from 1977 to 1989. He was a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1969 to 1973.

==Education==
Kelly received his primary and secondary education at St Conleth&#x27;s College in Dublin 4 and at the Glenstal Abbey School in County Limerick, respectively.

He attended University College Dublin between 1949 and 1954, and carried out postgraduate studies in the Heidelberg University, Germany, from 1954 to 1956. His thesis was published in 1957 as &quot;Princeps Iudex&quot;.

==Academic career==
In the early 1960s, Kelly held a position as a don in Trinity College, Oxford.

He was a distinguished academic, serving for many years as Professor of Constitutional law, Roman law and Jurisprudence in University College Dublin. He was author of the standard work on the Constitution of Ireland; though published after Kelly&#x27;s death, the third and later editions of this work still bear his name in honour of the original book. He was instrumental in the revival of the Irish law journal &quot;The Irish Jurist&quot; in the 1960s.

==Political career==
He first stood for election at the 1969 general election as a Fine Gael candidate in the Dublin South-Central constituency. He was not elected to Dáil Éireann on that occasion, but was subsequently elected to Seanad Éireann as a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel. He was elected to Dublin South-Central on his second attempt at the 1973 general election as a Fine Gael TD. He was elected for Dublin County South in 1977, and for Dublin South constituency from 1981 until his retirement from politics at the 1989 general election.

He served in the government of Liam Cosgrave (1973–1977) as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach with responsibility as Government Chief Whip and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. In May 1977, he was appointed as Attorney General of Ireland, succeeding Declan Costello upon the latter&#x27;s appointment to the High Court.

He served in Garret FitzGerald&#x27;s first cabinet from 1981 until 1982 as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. Kelly was also appointed as acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, pending the appointment of James Dooge, who was to be appointed to the Seanad, and as a Minister in October 1981.

Kelly declined appointment to FitzGerald&#x27;s second government (1982–1987). Kelly felt that Irish politics should be aligned more on European ideological lines, and he promoted closer alignment with Fianna Fáil and the end of coalition with the Labour Party. He did not seek re-election to the Dáil at the 1989 general election.

==Personal life==
Kelly&#x27;s son Nick was lead singer and songwriter with Irish rock band The Fat Lady Sings.

Kelly died on 24 January 1991, aged 59, after suffering a heart attack.

<doc id="1194211" wikidata="Q794061" url="?curid=1194211" title="Magnolia denudata">
<text>Magnolia denudata, the lilytree or Yulan magnolia (), is native to central and eastern China. It has been cultivated in Chinese Buddhist temple gardens since 600 AD. Its flowers were regarded as a symbol of purity in the Tang dynasty and it was planted in the grounds of the emperor&#x27;s palace. It is the official city flower of Shanghai.

==Description==
&quot;Magnolia denudata&quot; is a rather low, rounded, thickly branched, and coarse-textured tree to tall. The leaves are ovate, bright green, 15 cm long and 8 cm wide. The bark is a coarse, dark gray. The 10–16 cm white flowers that emerge from early to late spring, while beautiful and thick with a citrus-lemon fragrance, are prone to browning if subjected to frost.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Magnolia denudata&quot; is used as an ornamental tree in gardens. It is similar to other magnolias in that it likes rich, moist soil and should be planted in a location where it is protected from elemental extremes. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="1194217" wikidata="Q930632" url="?curid=1194217" title="HMS Shropshire">
<text>HMS &quot;Shropshire was a [[Royal Navy]] (RN) [[heavy cruiser]] of the &quot;London&quot; sub-class of s. She is the only warship to have been named after [[Shropshire]], England. Completed in 1929, &quot;Shropshire&quot; served with the RN until 1942, when she was transferred to the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) following the loss of sister ship . Commissioned asHMAS &quot;Shropshire, the ship remained in RAN service until 1949, and was sold for scrap in 1954.

==Design==
&quot;Shropshire&quot; was one of four heavy cruisers built to the &quot;London&quot; design of the s. The cruiser had a displacement of 9,830 tons at standard load, was long overall, long between perpendiculars, and had a beam of .

The propulsion system consisted of eight Yarrow-type boilers, which fed Parsons geared turbines. These generated 80,000 shaft horsepower, which was fed to the ship&#x27;s four diameter propellers. The cruiser could reach speeds of up to , with as the designated economical speed. At economical speed, she could travel .

===Armament===
The cruiser&#x27;s initial armament consisted of eight BL 8 inch Mk VIII naval guns in four twin turrets, four single QF 4 inch Mk V naval guns and four single QF 2 pounder naval guns (or pom-poms) for anti-aircraft defence, four 3-pounder guns, and a number of smaller calibre guns for point defence. During the 1930s, two 0.5-inch machine guns were added to the point defence armament.
Shortly before transfer to the RAN in 1943, &quot;Shropshire&quot; underwent a refit. Although the main armament was unchanged, the 4-inch guns were upgraded to twin mountings, while the anti-aircraft armament was replaced with eighteen 20 mm Oerlikon guns (seven twin mountings and four single mountings) and two QF 2-pounder Mark VI eight-barrelled pom-poms. The 3-pounder guns were deleted, while two quadruple-tube launchers for 21-inch torpedoes and several depth charge chutes were installed. During the same refit, the cruiser ceased operating its seaplane, and the aircraft catapult was removed.

In 1945, during a refit in Sydney, &quot;Shropshire&quot;″s armament changed again. The torpedo tubes and depth charge throwers were stripped from the ship, and the entire Oerlikon outfit was replaced by fifteen single 40 mm Bofors guns. By February 1946, six of the Bofors guns had been removed, with the cruiser&#x27;s armament settling into its final configuration.

==Construction==
Construction of the cruiser was ordered on 17 March 1926. &quot;Shropshire&quot; was laid down at the shipyard of William Beardmore and Company, at Dalmuir, Scotland on 24 February 1927. She was launched by Violet Herbert, Countess of Powis, on 5 July 1928. Completed on 12 September 1929, the cruiser was commissioned into the RN on 24 September 1929.

The ship&#x27;s name was chosen by First Lord of the Admiralty William Bridgeman, whose constituency was located in the county of Shropshire. &quot;Shropshire&quot; is the only ship of the RN or RAN to carry the name. The ship&#x27;s badge takes the leopard&#x27;s face from the arms of the Shropshire County Council.

==Operational history==

===RN service===
After post-commissioning workups, &quot;Shropshire&quot; was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the British Mediterranean Fleet in November 1929. During 1935 and 1936, the cruiser was involved in the British response to the Abyssinia Crisis. &quot;Shropshire&quot; was also present for the Spanish Civil War, and between 22 August and 16 September 1936, supported the evacuation of refugees from Barcelona. She remained in the Mediterranean (apart from returning to the United Kingdom for refits) until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, at which point the cruiser was reassigned to the South Atlantic for trade protection patrols.

On 9 December 1939, &quot;Shropshire&quot; intercepted the German merchant &quot;Adolf Leonhardt&quot;, which was scuttled by her own crew. The cruiser returned to Britain for a refit in early 1940, before proceeding to the Indian Ocean, where she was employed on convoy cover duties between Cape Town-Durban-Mombassa and Aden. She also participated in the campaign against Italian Somaliland during 1941, bombarding both Mogadishu and Kismayu during the advance of the South African Army from Kenya to Abyssinia, and sinking the Italian vessel &quot;Pensilvania&quot; off Mogadishu on 13 February. She remained in the South Atlantic, undergoing a refit at Simon&#x27;s Town between March and June 1941, then came home in October 1941 for a further major refit at Chatham between October 1941 and March 1942 before returning to the South Atlantic until the end of the year, when she was recalled to Chatham prior to transfer to the RAN.

The cruiser earned the RN battle honours &quot;Atlantic 1941&quot; and &quot;Arctic 1941&quot; for her wartime service.

===Transfer to RAN===
Following the loss of the Australian heavy cruiser , a County-class cruiser of the &quot;Kent&quot; sub-class, at the Battle of Savo Island, it was announced that &quot;Shropshire&quot; would be transferred to the RAN as a gift. King George VI announced on 10 September 1943 that the ship would be renamed &quot;Canberra&quot;. However, around the same time, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt chose to commemorate the Australian warship&#x27;s loss by renaming the under-construction &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; as .

The duplication of ship names with the United States Navy was against RAN policy, and it was initially felt that Australia had a greater claim to the name. Protests in favour of retaining &quot;Shropshire&quot;″s original name were received from the British elements of the ship&#x27;s company, who felt that renaming a ship after one that had recently been sunk was inviting bad luck, and from citizens of the ship&#x27;s namesake, which had adopted the cruiser in a Warship Week earlier that year, and thought that &quot;Shropshire&quot;″s history and links to the community were being discarded without thought. One letter proposed, that the ship be named &quot;HMAS &quot;Canberra (the gift of HMS) Shropshire&quot;&quot; in order to retain the old name. The Australian government decided to retain &quot;Shropshire&quot;″s old name after learning that the US offer had come directly from President Roosevelt.

&quot;Shropshire&quot; underwent refit at Chatham from December 1942 until 20 June 1943. Sources differ on the date of commissioning: although the commissioning ceremony was performed on 20 April, Captain John Augustine Collins successfully argued to have the ship recognised administratively as a commissioned Australian warship from 17 April, in order to keep Australian personnel (arriving that day) away from the RN rum issue. The refit was not completed until 25 June.

===RAN service===
&quot;Shropshire&quot; left the United Kingdom in August, as part of the escort for a convoy to Gibraltar. After this, she continued on to Australia, and arrived in Sydney on 2 October. At the end of the month, she joined Task Force 74 at Brisbane, and supported the amphibious landings at Arawe and Cape Gloucester during December. In March 1944, &quot;Shropshire&quot; was involved in the Admiralty Islands campaign. During April, the cruiser participated in the landing at Hollandia. In May, while operating in the Wakde-Sarmi-Biak area, a bomb was accidentally dropped by a United States aircraft between &quot;Shropshire&quot; and . Although the bomb missed both ships and appeared to cause no damage, the cruiser&#x27;s engines began to malfunction four days later, and &quot;Shropshire&quot; returned to Australia for repairs.
The ship returned to service on 12 July, and provided naval gunfire support for operations in Aitape and Cape Sansapore during July and August, Morotai in September, and Leyte Gulf in early October. &quot;Shropshire&quot; was reassigned to Task Force 77, and participated in the Battle of Surigao Strait on 25 October. The cruiser was involved in the Battle of Luzon during January 1945, during which she was attacked by two kamikaze aircraft: one narrowly missed, while the second was shot down by close enough for debris to hit &quot;Shropshire&quot;. &quot;Shropshire&quot; fired in anger for the last time during the Corregidor landings, then briefly returned to Australia.

&quot;Shropshire&quot; returned to the Philippines in time for the Japanese surrender of the islands, then proceeded to Japan, and was present at Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945 for the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. The cruiser&#x27;s wartime service with the RAN was recognised with five battle honours: &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;, &quot;Leyte Gulf 1944&quot;, Lingayen Gulf 1945&quot;, &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;, and &quot;Pacific 1945&quot;. Only five personnel died during the ship&#x27;s RAN service, but although all five occurred during World War II, none were the result of enemy action; one drowned, and the other four were the result of accidents.
The cruiser remained in Japanese waters until 17 November, when she sailed for Sydney. In May 1946, &quot;Shropshire&quot; transported the Australian contingent to England for the British Empire victory celebrations. The ship returned home in August. From January until March 1947, &quot;Shropshire&quot; was again in Japanese waters.

==Decommissioning and fate==
After returning to Sydney in March 1947, &quot;Shropshire&quot; was prepared for decommissioning, although she was not paid off into reserve until 10 November 1949. The ship was sold to Thos. W. Ward of Sheffield, England, acting on behalf of the British Iron &amp; Steel Corporation, on 16 July 1954, for £82,500 sterling. On 9 October 1954, the Dutch tug &quot;Oostzee&quot; began the voyage from Sydney to Dalmuir, Scotland. Breaking commenced in Dalmuir on 20 January 1955, with the ship&#x27;s hull then transported to Troon, where scrapping resumed on 19 September.

A silver bugle presented to the ship by the King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry was kept by the RAN after &quot;Shropshire&quot;″s decommissioning, and was later placed on display at the Russell Offices (which houses the Department of Defence) until at least the mid-1980s.

<doc id="1194220" wikidata="Q1273173" url="?curid=1194220" title="E-mu Emulator">
<text>The Emulator is a series of digital sampling synthesizers using floppy-disk storage that was manufactured by E-mu Systems from 1981 until 2002. Although it was not the first commercial sampler, the Emulator was innovative in its integration of computer technology and was among the first samplers to find widespread usage among musicians. While costly, its price was considerably lower than those of its early competitors, and its smaller size increased its portability and, resultantly, practicality for live performance. The line was discontinued in 2002.

==Impetus==
E-mu Systems was founded in 1971 as a manufacturer of microprocessor chips, digital scanning keyboards and components for electronic instruments. Licensing revenue for this technology afforded E-mu the ability to invest in research and development, and it began to develop boutique synthesizers for niche markets, including a series of modular synthesizers and the high-end Audity system, of which only one prototype was produced. In 1979, founders Scott Wedge and Dave Rossum saw the Fairlight CMI and the Linn LM-1 at a convention, inspiring them to design and produce a less expensive digital sampling keyboard.

E-mu originally considered selling the design for the Emulator to Sequential Circuits, which was using E-mu&#x27;s keyboard design in its Prophet-5 synthesizer. However, Sequential Circuits ceased paying E-mu royalties for its keyboard design, which prompted E-mu to release the Emulator commercially.

==Products==
===Emulator===

Finally released in 1981, the Emulator was a floppy disk-based keyboard workstation that enabled the musician to sample sounds, recording them to storage media and allowing them to be played as musical notes on the keyboard. The 5&quot; floppy disk drive enabled the owner to build a library of samples and share them with others, or to purchase prerecorded libraries on disk.

The original Emulator was a very basic eight-bit sampler with only a simple filter, and it only allowed for a single loop. The initial model did not include a VCA envelope generator. It was produced in three forms: a two-voice model (only one of which was ever sold), a four-voice model and an eight-voice model. The keyboard was designed to be played in split mode with one sample on each side, so playing the same sound on the full keyboard required loading the same sound from disk into each side.

Stevie Wonder, who gave the sampler a glowing review at the 1981 NAMM International Music &amp; Sound Expo, received the first unit (serial number 0001). The first unit had originally been promised to Daryl Dragon of Captain &amp; Tennille, as he was a longtime E-mu modular-system owner, but Wonder&#x27;s greater fame moved him to the top of the list. In 1982, the Emulator was updated to include a VCA envelope generator and a simple sequencer, and its price was lowered. Approximately 500 units were sold before the unit was discontinued in early 1984. Other users of the original E-mu Emulator were New Order, Tangerine Dream and Tony Banks of Genesis, and it was among the instruments used in the production of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album. Composer and writer David Frank of the System used the original Emulator on his productions from &quot;Sweat&quot; to &quot;Don&#x27;t Disturb this Groove&quot;. The Residents, who had received the fifth Emulator produced, used the instrument extensively on their album &quot;The Tunes of Two Cities&quot;. Vangelis had an Emulator at Nemo Studios in London and used it on the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; soundtrack.

===Emulator II===

Released commercially in 1984, the Emulator II (or EII) was E-mu&#x27;s second sampler. Like the original Emulator, it was an eight-bit sampler, but it delivered superior fidelity by employing companding digital-to-analog converters and a 27.7 kHz sample rate. It also allowed more flexibility in editing and shaping sounds, as resonant analog filters (provided by longtime E-Mu collaborators SSM) were added. The EII also featured greatly improved real-time control. Its price was similar to that of the original Emulator, at US$7,995 for a regular model and $9,995 for a &quot;plus&quot; model featuring extra sample memory. Several upgrades, including a second floppy drive, a 20 MB hard drive, and a 512K memory upgrade were also available. Despite the EII&#x27;s price, it was considered a value in comparison to the Fairlight CMI Series II, the most basic model of which was priced at $30,000 upon its initial release.

The Emulator II offers a unique sound because of its DPCM mu-255 companding, divider-based variable sample-rate principle and analog output stages featuring SSM2045 24 dB/oct analog four-pole low-pass resonant filters.

Several OEM and third-party sample libraries were developed for the Emulator II, including orchestral sounds. Many of the EII&#x27;s original library sounds were sampled from the more expensive Fairlight and Synclavier workstations (for example, the Fairlight&#x27;s &quot;Sarrar/Arr1&quot; choir sample is called &quot;DigiVcs&quot; in the E-mu library). Samples include the Shakuhachi flute used by Peter Gabriel on &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and by Enigma on their album &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, and the Marcato Strings heard on the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;West End Girls&quot;. According to the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; Neil Tennant, every instrumental sound on the track was produced with an Emulator II.

Musicians who used The Emulator II in the 1980s includes early adopter Stevie Wonder, Front 242, Depeche Mode, 808 State, New Order, ABC, Genesis, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Herbie Hancock, Vangelis, Tangerine Dream, Jean-Michel Jarre, Yes, OMD, Stevie Nicks and Mr. Mister.

It was also used on the &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; film score by Brad Fiedel, many of Michael Kamen&#x27;s film scores (such as &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot;) and nearly all of John Carpenter&#x27;s films in the 1980s. The Emulator II is featured in the film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; when the titular character plays samples of coughing and sneezing in order to feign illness over a phone. David Foster mentioned his Emulator II in the 1985 documentary about the creation of &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, a song in which a note of a French horn was included in the single.

===Emulator III===

The Emulator III was introduced after the discontinuation of the Emulator II in 1987, and was manufactured until 1991. A rack-mountable version was introduced in 1988.

It featured four or eight megabytes of memory, depending on the model, and it could store samples in 16-bit, 44 kHz stereo, which was equivalent to that of the most advanced, professional equipment available. The Emulator III&#x27;s sound quality was also improved greatly over that of its predecessors, with quieter outputs and more reliable filter chips produced by CEM. However, the Emulator III was considerably less popular than its predecessors, largely because of its price; at a time when manufacturers such as Akai, Ensoniq and Casio offered samplers at less than $2,000, the Emulator III&#x27;s use of high-quality components resulted in a price as high as $12,695 for the 4 MB model and $15,195 for the 8 MB model. E-mu had previously been able to sell its samplers in the $10,000 range because the only alternatives were the $30,000–$200,000 Fairlight CMI and the $75,000–$500,000 NED Synclavier system. However, as technology had advanced and become increasingly accessible, E-mu faced great difficulty remaining competitive.

Although the Emulator III did not prove a great success, it may be heard in the music of Tony Banks of Genesis, Lynda Thomas, 808 State and Depeche Mode; the latter used it on their 1990 album &quot;Violator&quot;.

===Emulator IV and EOS===

The Emulator IV (EIV or E4) series of samplers was introduced in 1994. The new, proprietary operating system used in the EIV was known as the Emulator Operating System or EOS. The flash memory in these models was expandable. 

The Emulator IV was the first to be released, a rack sampler that featured 128 voices and memory expansion up to 128 MB. Options included a multi-effects processor, additional output sockets, and 32 MIDI channels.

The e64 was launched in 1995 and, in order to meet a lower price point, was limited to only 64 voices and a maximum 64 MB of memory. It was joined in 1996 by the E4K, essentially an E64 with a 76-key weighted keyboard; however, it could be expanded to 128 voices and 128 MB of memory and included the effects processor and other previous options as standard.

A second series of rackmount EIV was launched in 1997 with the E4X Turbo as the new 128-voice flagship model. The E4X (without Turbo) and e6400 offered only 64 voices and fewer options in order to meet lower price points, although unlike the e64, it was fully upgradable. E-mu also released the E-Synth in both rack and keyboard form, with both models including a 16 MB sound ROM and an optional 16 MB &quot;Dance&quot; factory-installed sound ROM that would be accessible immediately upon startup of the unit. The E-Synth Keyboard was the final Emulator keyboard model to be produced.

In 1999, the final EIV samplers were marketed with the Ultra designation. The Ultras featured a fast processor and upgraded analog output stages, as well as the ability to install the RFX dedicated high-quality effects processor and ultimately run the very final version of EOS. The entry-level model was the E5000 Ultra, which was limited to four output jacks, could not accept the voice upgrade, and was unable to write sound ROMs. The E6400 Ultra (now with a capital &quot;E&quot;) was a basic model but with full upgradability, the E-Synth Ultra (rack only) refined the previous E-Synth models (since referred to as &quot;Classic&quot;s) with one or two new 16 MB sound ROMs, and the E4XT Ultra was the top model with the full 128 voices, digital audio inputs and outputs, 32 MIDI channels, and an ASCII keyboard input for remote control. The final Ultra sampler, called the E4 Platinum, was loaded with the RFX effects card and every option.

The EIV series was discontinued in 2002.

<text>Joseph Vere Everette Johns (28 November 1893 – 10 September 1966) was a Jamaican journalist, impresario, radio personality, and actor, who helped to launch the careers of many Jamaican musicians through his popular talent contests.

==Biography==
Johns was born in Mandeville in 1893, and after working for the Post Office, served in the South Lancashire Regiment in World War I before finding success as a newspaper columnist in the United States in the 1920s. While in the US he divorced his first wife and married his second, actress Lillian May, known as &quot;Lady Luck&quot;. He began running talent contests while in the US, and continued on his return to Jamaica in 1939. In the late 1940s he began a long-running &quot;Vere Johns Says&quot; column in the &quot;Jamaica Star&quot; newspaper, often on the topic of music.

He made a major contribution to Jamaican music with his &quot;Vere John&#x27;s Opportunity Knocks Talent Show&quot; on RJR Radio and helped launch the careers of several major recording artists including Lloyd Charmers, Hortense Ellis, John Holt, Bob Andy, Desmond Dekker, The Wailers, Alton Ellis, Jackie Edwards, Dobby Dobson, Boris Gardiner, Laurel Aitken, and Millie Small. His talent contests began as theatre shows held in downtown Kingston venues such as The Majestic, Palace and Ambassador theatres, with the winners judged by audience reaction, and going on to appear on his radio shows. Producers such as Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd and Arthur &quot;Duke&quot; Reid scouted for talent at the shows, taking singers to record at Stanley Motta&#x27;s studio to cut records to be played on their sound systems. Lloyd Bradley, in his book &quot;This is Reggae Music&quot;, described Johns as &quot;the most influential man in Jamaican music in the second half of the 1950s&quot;, a period in which indigenous Jamaican styles were coming to the fore. Johns, despite his antipathy towards Jamaica&#x27;s Rastafarians, also provided exposure for Count Ossie&#x27;s group of drummers after singer Marguerita Mahfood refused to appear on his show unless she was backed by Ossie&#x27;s Mystic Revelation group; The group proved popular with the audience and went on to perform regularly in Kingston.

Johns also worked as an actor, performing in Shakespeare plays and solo recitations, and taught acting.

Vere Johns died in Kingston, Jamaica on 10 September 1966.

== Honors ==
* Military Medal, November 1917
* British War Medal
* Victory Medal
* Member of the Order of the British Empire, June 1953
* Seprod Award, 1964 and 1965

In 2008, Johns was posthumously inducted into the Jamaica Association of Vintage Artistes and Affiliates (JAVAA) Hall of Fame. In 2012, former Minister of Culture Olivia Grange called for Johns to receive a posthumous honour in recognition of his contribution to Jamaican popular music.

<text>The Nontron knife is a traditional wooden-handled knife manufactured in the village of Nontron in the Dordogne area of southern France, in a tradition said to date back to the 15th century. The handle is usually of boxwood. 

==Overview==
Nontron knives are decorated with pokerwork designs based on a distinctive logo, and are now highly prized as a style item. 

The Nontron penknife is similar in appearance to the cheaper and much more widespread Opinel knife, though the blades and handles are more various in shape. 

==Manufacture==
Nontron also manufacture a variety of table cutlery, chefs knives, and carving knives. Many of these use the traditional boxwood handle but others use more modern materials compatible with dishwashers.

<doc id="1194227" wikidata="Q125814326" url="?curid=1194227" title="Black-backed jackal">
<text>The black-backed jackal (Lupulella mesomelas), also called the silver-backed jackal, is a medium-sized canine native to eastern and southern Africa. These regions are separated by roughly 900 kilometers.

One region includes the southernmost tip of the continent, including South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. The other area is along the eastern coastline, including Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as least concern due to its widespread range and adaptability, although it is still persecuted as a livestock predator and rabies vector.

Compared to members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, the black-backed jackal is a very ancient species, and has changed little since the Pleistocene, being the most basal wolf-like canine, alongside the closely related side-striped jackal. It is a fox-like animal with a reddish brown to tan coat and a black saddle that extends from the shoulders to the base of the tail. It is a monogamous animal, whose young may remain with the family to help raise new generations of pups. The black-backed jackal has a wide array of food sources, feeding on small to medium-sized animals, as well as plant matter and human refuse.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber named &quot;Canis mesomelas&quot; in 1775. It was later proposed as the genus &quot;Lupulella&quot; Hilzheimer 1906.

The black-backed jackal has occupied eastern and southern Africa for at least 2–3 million years, as shown by fossil deposits in Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. Specimens from fossil sites in Transvaal are almost identical to their modern counterparts, but have slightly different nasal bones. As no fossils have been found north of Ethiopia, the species likely has always been sub-Saharan in distribution. The black-backed jackal is relatively unspecialised, and can thrive in a wide variety of habitats, including deserts, as its kidneys are well adapted for water deprivation. It is, however, more adapted to a carnivorous diet than the other jackals, as shown by its well-developed carnassial shear and the longer cutting blade of the premolars.

Juliet Clutton-Brock classed the black-backed jackal as being closely related to the side-striped jackal, based on cranial and dental characters. Studies on allozyme divergence within the Canidae indicate that the black-backed jackal and other members of the genus &quot;Canis&quot; are separated by a considerable degree of genetic distance. Further studies show a large difference in mitochondrial DNA sequences between black-backed jackals and other sympatric &quot;jackal&quot; species, consistent with divergence 2.3–4.5 million years ago.

A mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) sequence alignment for the wolf-like canids gave a phylogenetic tree with the side-striped jackal and the black-backed jackal being the most basal members of this clade, which means that this tree is indicating an African origin for the clade.

Because of this deep divergence between the black-backed jackal and the rest of the &quot;wolf-like&quot; canids, one author has proposed to change the species&#x27; generic name from &quot;Canis&quot; to &quot;Lupulella&quot;.

In 2017, jackal relationships were further explored, with an mDNA study finding that the two black-backed jackal subspecies had diverged from each other 2.5 million years ago to form the south African and east African populations. The study proposes that due to this long separation, which is longer than the separation of the African golden wolf from the wolf lineage, that the two subspecies might warrant separate species status.

In 2019, members of the IUCN SSC Canid Specialist Group recommended that the side-striped jackal (&quot;Canis adustus&quot;) and black-backed jackal (&quot;Canis mesomelas&quot;) should be placed in a distinct genus, &quot;Lupulella&quot; Hilzheimer, 1906 with the names &quot;Lupulella adusta&quot; and &quot;Lupulella mesomelas&quot; because DNA evidence shows that they form a monophyletic lineage that sits outside of the Canis/Cuon/Lycaon clade.

The phylogenetic tree for the wolf-like canids may give conflicting positions for the black-backed jackal and the side-striped jackal relative to the genus &quot;Canis&quot; members depending on whether the genetic markers were based on mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA (from the cell&#x27;s nucleus). The explanation proposed is that mitochondrial DNA introgression occurred from an ancient ancestor of &quot;Canis&quot; into the lineage that led to the black-backed jackal around 6.2–5.2 million years ago.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognised by MSW3. These subspecies are geographically separated by a gap which extends northwards from Zambia to Tanzania:

==Description==

The black-backed jackal is a fox-like canid with a slender body, long legs, and large ears. It is similar to the closely related side-striped jackal and more distantly related to the golden jackal, though its skull and dentition are more robust and the incisors much sharper. It weighs , stands at the shoulder, and measures in body length.

The base colour is reddish brown to tan, which is particularly pronounced on the flanks and legs. A black saddle intermixed with silvery hair extends from the shoulders to the base of the tail. A long, black stripe extending along the flanks separates the saddle from the rest of the body, and can be used to differentiate individuals. The tail is bushy and tipped with black. The lips, throat, chest, and inner surface of the limbs are white. The winter coat is a much deeper reddish brown. Albino specimens occasionally occur. The hair of the face measures 10–15 mm in length, and lengthens to 30–40 mm on the rump. The guard hairs of the back are 60 mm on the shoulder, decreasing to 40 mm at the base of the tail. The hairs of the tail are the longest, measuring 70 mm in length.

==Behaviour==
===Social and territorial behaviours===

The black-backed jackal is a monogamous and territorial animal, whose social organisation greatly resembles that of the golden jackal. However, the assistance of elder offspring in helping raise the pups of their parents has a greater bearing on pup survival rates than in the latter species. The basic social unit is a monogamous mated pair which defends its territory through laying faeces and urine on range boundaries. Scent marking is usually done in tandem, and the pair aggressively expels intruders. Such encounters are normally prevented, as the pair vocalises to advertise its presence in a given area. It is a highly vocal species, particularly in Southern Africa. Sounds made by the species include yelling, yelping, woofing, whining, growling, and cackling. It communicates with group members and advertises its presence by a high-pitched, whining howl, and expresses alarm through an explosive cry followed by shorter, high-pitched yelps. This sound is particularly frantic when mobbing a leopard. In areas where the black-backed jackal is sympatric with the African golden wolf, the species does not howl, instead relying more on yelps. In contrast, black-backed jackals in Southern Africa howl much like golden jackals. When trapped, it cackles like a fox.

===Reproduction and development===
The mating season takes place from late May to August, with a gestation period of 60 days. Pups are born from July to October. Summer births are thought to be timed to coincide with population peaks of vlei rats and four-striped grass mice, while winter births are timed for ungulate calving seasons. Litters consist of one to nine pups, which are born blind. For the first three weeks of their lives, the pups are kept under constant surveillance by their dam, while the sire and elder offspring provide food. The pups open their eyes after 8–10 days and emerge from the den at the age of 3 weeks. They are weaned at 8–9 weeks, and can hunt by themselves at the age of 6 months. Sexual maturity is attained at 11 months, though few black-backed jackals reproduce in their first year. Unlike golden jackals, which have comparatively amicable intrapack relationships, black-backed jackal pups become increasingly quarrelsome as they age, and establish more rigid dominance hierarchies. Dominant pups appropriate food, and become independent at an earlier age. The grown pups may disperse at one year of age, though some remain in their natal territories to assist their parents in raising the next generation of pups. The average lifespan in the wild is 7 years, though captive specimens can live twice as long.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
The species generally shows a preference for open areas with little dense vegetation, though it occupies a wide range of habitats, from arid coastal deserts to areas with more than 2000 mm of rainfall. It also occurs in farmlands, savannas, open savanna mosaics, and alpine areas.

===Diet===

Black-backed jackals are omnivores. Their diet includes invertebrates, such as beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, millipedes, spiders, and scorpions. Mammals are eaten such as rodents, hares, and young antelopes up to the size of topi calves. They also feed on carrion, birds, bird eggs, lizards and snakes. In coastal areas, they feed on beached marine mammals, seals, fish, and mussels. They also consume occasionally fruits and berries.

In South Africa, black-backed jackals frequently prey on antelopes (primarily impala and springbok and occasionally duiker, reedbuck, and steenbok), carrion, hares, hoofed livestock, insects, and rodents. They also prey on small carnivores, such as mongooses, polecats, and wildcats. On the coastline of the Namib Desert, jackals feed primarily on marine birds (mainly Cape and white-breasted cormorants and jackass penguins), marine mammals (including Cape fur seals), fish, and insects. In East Africa, during the dry season, they hunt the young of gazelles, impalas, topi, tsessebe, and warthogs. In Serengeti woodlands, they feed heavily on African grass rats. 

A single jackal is capable of killing a healthy adult impala. Adult dik-diks and Thomson&#x27;s gazelles seem to be the upper limit of their killing capacity, though they target larger species if those are sick, with one pair having been observed to harass a crippled bull rhinoceros. A pair of black-backed jackals in the Kalahari desert was observed to kill a kori bustard, and on a separate occasion, a black mamba by prolonged harassment of the snake and crushing of the snake&#x27;s head. They typically kill tall prey by biting at the legs and loins, and frequently go for the throat. Like most canids, the black-backed jackal caches surplus food. 

The jackals sniff out the ripe melon fruits of the ǃnaras, a leafless, spined drought resilient plant using their jaws to bite through their tough skins. &quot;The chewing molars of canids make them ideal agents for endozoochorous dispersal of large seeds.&quot; Such disperal is long-distance, the size of their home ranges (7–15.9 km). The jackals urinate on buried fruits and later return to them; it is suggested either to mark ownership or mask their smell from rival jackals. Seeds from their droppings germinate better than those extracted directly from ripe fruit. While other carnivores eat other fruits, this seems to be the first case where they might be a plant&#x27;s primary dispersers.

===Enemies and competitors===
In areas where the black-backed jackal is sympatric with the larger side-striped jackal, the former species aggressively drives out the latter from grassland habitats into woodlands. This is unique among carnivores, as larger species commonly displace smaller ones. Black-backed jackal pups are vulnerable to African wolf, honey badger, spotted hyena and brown hyena. Adults have few natural predators, save for leopards and African wild dogs. Though there are some reports that martial eagles prey on both juveniles and adults.

==Diseases and parasites==
Black-backed jackals can carry diseases such as rabies, canine parvovirus, canine distemper, canine adenovirus, &quot;Ehrlichia canis&quot;, and African horse sickness. Jackals in Etosha National Park may carry anthrax. Black-backed jackals are major rabies vectors, and have been associated with epidemics, which appear to cycle every 4–8 years. Jackals in Zimbabwe are able to maintain rabies independently of other species. Although oral vaccinations are effective in jackals, the long-term control of rabies continues to be a problem in areas where stray dogs are not given the same immunisation.

Jackals may also carry trematodes such as &quot;Athesmia&quot;, cestodes such as &quot;Dipylidium caninum&quot;, &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot;, &quot;Joyeuxialla echinorhyncoides&quot;, &quot;J. pasqualei&quot;, &quot;Mesocestoides lineatus&quot;, &quot;Taenia erythraea&quot;, &quot;T. hydatigena&quot;, &quot;T. jackhalsi&quot;, &quot;T. multiceps&quot;, &quot;T. pungutchui&quot;, and &quot;T. serialis&quot;. Nematodes carried by black-backed jackals include &quot;Ancylostoma braziliense&quot;, &quot;A. caninum&quot;, &quot;A. martinaglia&quot;, &quot;A. somaliense&quot;, &quot;A. tubaeforme&quot;, and &quot;Physaloptera praeputialis&quot;, and protozoans such as &quot;Babesia canis&quot;, &quot;Ehrlichia canis&quot;, &quot;Hepatozoon canis&quot;, &quot;Rickettsia canis&quot;, &quot;Sarcocytis&quot; spp., &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, and &quot;Trypanosoma congolense&quot;. Mites may cause sarcoptic mange. Tick species include &quot;Amblyomma hebraeum&quot;, &quot;A. marmoreum&quot;, &quot;A. nymphs&quot;, &quot;A. variegatum&quot;, &quot;Boophilus decoloratus&quot;, &quot;Haemaphysalis leachii&quot;, &quot;H. silacea&quot;, &quot;H. spinulosa&quot;, &quot;Hyelomma&quot; spp., &quot;Ixodes pilosus&quot;, &quot;I. rubicundus&quot;, &quot;Rhipicephalus appendiculatus&quot;, &quot;R. evertsi&quot;, &quot;R. sanguineus&quot;, and &quot;R. simus&quot;. Flea species include &quot;Ctenocephalides cornatus&quot;, &quot;Echidnophaga gallinacea&quot;, and &quot;Synosternus caffer&quot;.

==Relationships with humans==

===In folklore===
Black-backed jackals feature prominently in the folklore of the Khoikhoi, where it is often paired with the lion, whom it frequently outsmarts or betrays with its superior intelligence. One story explains that the black-backed jackal gained its dark saddle when it offered to carry the Sun on its back. An alternative account comes from the ǃKung people, whose folklore tells that the jackal received the burn on its back as a punishment for its scavenging habits. According to an ancient Ethiopian folktale, jackals and man first became enemies shortly before the Great Flood, when Noah initially refused to allow jackals into Noah&#x27;s Ark, thinking they were unworthy of being saved, until being commanded by God to do so.

===Livestock predation===
Black-backed jackals occasionally hunt domestic animals, including dogs, cats, pigs, goats, sheep, and poultry, with sheep tending to predominate. They rarely target cattle, though cows giving birth may be attacked. Jackals can be a serious problem for sheep farmers, particularly during the lambing season. Sheep losses to black-backed jackals in a 440 km2 study area in KwaZulu-Natal consisted of 0.05% of the sheep population. Of 395 sheep killed in a sheep farming area in KwaZulu-Natal, 13% were killed by jackals. Jackals usually kill sheep with a throat bite, and begin feeding by opening the flank and consuming the flesh and skin of the flank, heart, liver, some ribs, haunch of hind leg, and sometimes the stomach and its contents. In older lambs, the main portions eaten are usually heart and liver. Usually, only one lamb per night is killed in any one place, but sometimes two and occasionally three may be killed. The oral history of the Khoikhoi indicates they have been a nuisance to pastoralists long before European settlement. South Africa has been using fencing systems to protect sheep from jackals since the 1890s, though such measures have mixed success, as the best fencing is expensive, and jackals can easily infiltrate cheap wire fences.

===Hunting===
Due to livestock losses to jackals, many hunting clubs were opened in South Africa in the 1850s. Black-backed jackals have never been successfully eradicated in hunting areas, despite strenuous attempts to do so with dogs, poison, and gas. Black-backed jackal coursing was first introduced to the Cape Colony in the 1820s by Lord Charles Somerset, who as an avid fox hunter, sought a more effective method of managing jackal populations, as shooting proved ineffective. Coursing jackals also became a popular pastime in the Boer Republics. In the western Cape in the early 20th century, dogs bred by crossing foxhounds, lurchers, and borzoi were used.

Spring traps with metal jaws were also effective, though poisoning by strychnine became more common by the late 19th century. Strychnine poisoning was initially problematic, as the solution had a bitter taste, and could only work if swallowed. Consequently, many jackals learned to regurgitate poisoned baits, thus inciting wildlife managers to use the less detectable crystal strychnine rather than liquid. The poison was usually placed within sheep carcasses or in balls of fat, with great care being taken to avoid leaving any human scent on them. Black-backed jackals were not a popular quarry in the 19th century, and are rarely mentioned in hunter&#x27;s literature. By the turn of the century, jackals became increasingly popular quarry as they encroached upon human habitations after sheep farming and veld burning diminished their natural food sources. Although poisoning had been effective in the late 19th century, its success rate in eliminating jackals waned in the 20th century, as jackals seemed to be learning to distinguish poisoned foods.

The Tswana people often made hats and cloaks out of black-backed jackal skins. Between 1914 and 1917, 282,134 jackal pelts (nearly 50,000 a year) were produced in South Africa. Demand for pelts grew during the First World War, and were primarily sold in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. Jackals in their winter fur were in great demand, though animals killed by poison were less valued, as their fur would shed.

<doc id="1194230" wikidata="Q1245839" url="?curid=1194230" title="Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)">
<text>Joseph McGrath (12 August 1888 – 26 March 1966) was an Irish politician and businessman. He was a Sinn Féin and later a Cumann na nGaedheal Teachta Dála (TD) for various constituencies; Dublin St James&#x27;s (1918–1921), Dublin North West (1921–1923) and Mayo North (1923–1924), and developed widespread business interests.

==Political career==

McGrath was born in Dublin in 1888. By 1916 he was working with his brother George at Craig Gardiner &amp; Co., a firm of accountants in Dawson Street, Dublin. He worked with Michael Collins, a part-time fellow clerk and the two struck up a friendship. In his spare time McGrath worked as secretary for the Volunteer Dependents&#x27; Fund.

He soon joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He fought in Marrowbone Lane in the 1916 Easter Rising. McGrath was arrested after the rising, and jailed in Wormwood Scrubs and Brixton prisons in England. In the 1918 general election, he was elected as Sinn Féin TD for the Dublin St James&#x27;s constituency, later sitting in the First Dáil. He was also a member of the Irish Republican Army, the guerrilla army of the Irish Republic, and successfully organised many bank robberies during the Irish war of Independence (1919–1921), where a small percentage of the proceeds was retained as a reward by him and his fellow-soldiers. During this time he was interred briefly at Ballykinlar Internment Camp. He escaped by dressing in army uniform and walking out of the gate with soldiers going on leave. He was eventually recaptured and spent time in jail in Belfast.

In October 1921 McGrath travelled with the Irish Treaty delegation to London as one of Michael Collins&#x27; personal staff. When the Provisional Government of Ireland was set up in January 1922, McGrath was appointed as Minister for Labour. In the Irish Civil War of 1922–1923, he took the pro-treaty side and was made Director of Intelligence, replacing Liam Tobin. In a strongly worded letter, written in red ink, McGrath warned Collins not to take his last, ill-fated trip to Cork.

He was later put in charge of the police Intelligence service of the new Irish Free State, the Criminal Investigation Department or CID. It was modelled on the London Metropolitan Police department of the same name, but was accused of the torture and killing of a number of republican (anti-treaty) prisoners during the civil war. It was disbanded at the war&#x27;s end; the official reason given was that it was unnecessary for a police force in peacetime. McGrath went on to serve as Minister for Labour in the Second Dáil and the Provisional Government of Ireland. He also served in the 1st and 2nd Executive Councils holding the Industry and Commerce portfolio.

In September 1922 McGrath used strikebreakers to oppose a strike by Trade Unionists in the Post Office service, despite having threatened to resign in March of the same year when the government threatened to use British strikebreakers.

In December 1922 McGrath was a reluctant supporter of the government&#x27;s decision to execute four high profile IRA prisoners; Liam Mellows, Dick Barrett, Rory O&#x27;Connor, and Joe McKelvey.

===Army Mutiny, Resignation, National Party===

McGrath resigned from office in April 1924 because of dissatisfaction with the government&#x27;s attitude to the Army Mutiny officers and as he said himself, &quot;government by a clique and by the officialdom of the old regime&quot;. By this he meant that former IRA fighters were being overlooked and that the Republican goals on all Ireland had been sidelined. McGrath and eight other TDs who had resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal then resigned their seats in the Dáil and formed a new political party, the National Party. However, the new party did not contest the subsequent by-elections for their old seats. Instead, Cumann na nGaedheal won seven of the seats and Sinn Féin won the other two.

===Accusation of involvement in the death of Noel Lemass===
In 1927, McGrath took a libel case against the publishers of &quot;The Real Ireland&quot; by poet Cyril Bretherton, a book that claimed McGrath was responsible for the abduction and murder of Noel Lemass (the brother of Seán Lemass) in June 1923 during the civil war, as well as a subsequent coverup. McGrath won the court case. During the 1930s, McGrath and Seán Lemass reconciled and regularly played poker together.

==Business interests==
Following his political career, he went on to become involved in the building trade. In 1925 he became labour adviser to Siemens-Schuckert, German contractors for the Ardnacrusha hydro-electric scheme near Limerick. McGrath founded the Irish Hospitals&#x27; Sweepstake in 1930, and the success of its sweepstakes made him an extremely wealthy man. He had other extensive and successful business interests always investing in Ireland and became Ireland&#x27;s best-known racehorse owner and breeder, winning The Derby with &quot;Arctic Prince&quot; in 1951.

==Personal life==
McGrath died at his home, Cabinteely House in Dublin, on 26 March 1966. Cabinteely House was donated to the state in 1986, and the land developed as a public park. Joseph&#x27;s son Patrick W. McGrath inherited many of his father&#x27;s business interests, and also served as Fine Gael Senator from 1973 to 1977.

<doc id="1194232" wikidata="Q7069817" url="?curid=1194232" title="Nuneaton rail crash">
<text>The Nuneaton rail crash occurred on 6 June 1975, on the West Coast Main Line just south of Nuneaton railway station in Warwickshire, England, United Kingdom.

The crash happened when the 23:30 sleeper from London Euston to Glasgow derailed after entering a temporary speed restriction at 4 times the speed limit. Six people (four passengers and two staff) died and 38 were injured. In the subsequent inquiry, the crash was deemed to have been caused by driver error, partially due to the failure of gas lit lamps that illuminated the lineside signage warning of the speed restriction.

==The crash==
The crash occurred at approximately 01:54, as the British Rail passenger train approached Nuneaton station. The train, which was running over an hour late because of a locomotive failure further south, was composed of two Class 86 electric locomotives (nos. 86006 and 86242; both later repaired) and fifteen carriages, including twelve Mark 1 sleeping cars, two Brake Gangwayed and a Restaurant miniature buffet. Among the passengers was Minister for Agriculture Fred Peart, who would survive the crash with minor injuries.

Just south of Nuneaton station, a temporary speed restriction of was in place for a distance of just over a mile because of a track remodelling scheme. This was due to a sharply curved length of temporary track being used to divert trains around the area being remodeled. The warning board was placed at the standard &#x27;service braking distance&#x27; of a mile and a quarter before the restriction. This board should have been illuminated, but the lights had gone out. The driver, John McKay, claimed that he assumed this meant the restriction had been lifted and did not need to slow the train. It was not until he saw the correctly illuminated &#x27;commencement board&#x27; at the start of the restriction that he realized it was still in place, but by then it was too late.

Despite an emergency brake application, the train entered the 20 mph restriction at an estimated and derailed on the temporary track. The locomotives became detached from one another; the first continued in a straight line and came to a stop halfway through the station between the platforms, but the second veered sideways, striking and then mounting the northbound platform, coming to a rest after colliding with the platform canopy. The coaches behind them derailed and zig-zagged across the tracks causing severe damage to the track and lineside structures. The first two coaches stayed mainly upright, but the next four fell on their sides and piled into each other, badly crushing the third, fourth and fifth coaches. All the fatalities and most of the injuries occurred in these four sleeping cars. Every vehicle on the train was derailed except the last. The inquiry noted that casualties would have been much higher if not for the lightly loaded nature of the train (there were fewer than 100 passengers on board).

Over of track was destroyed along with three lineside electrification gantries, as well as severe damage to an overhead road bridge, numerous items of trackside equipment, and the locomotive of a passing freight train (Class 25 number 25286), which was damaged by falling overhead line equipment.
==The Inquiry==

The inquiry, conducted by Major C. F. Rose, found the crash to be due to the following causes:
* The advance warning board was not illuminated because the gas lighting equipment had been set up incorrectly, and had gone out some time between 01:10 and 01:40. The lights had gone out because the gas cylinder supplying it had run empty; the equipment had two gas cylinders, and included a valve which would allow the gas supply to automatically switch from one cylinder to the other when one was empty, but this valve was not being used.
* A number of drivers on preceding trains noticed that the lights had gone out, but did not stop and report it as they should have done according to the rules.
* The driver of the train before driver McKay’s train claimed that the warning board was fully lit, but he later told the inquiry that he thought he had forgotten his hand lamp and was looking for it in his bag when he passed the warning board and did not see the condition of the lamps.
* Although driver McKay claimed that he believed the speed restriction had been lifted when he did not see the warning board, the inquiry considered this unlikely, and noted that he had driven a train over the same stretch of track the previous night, and had seen the extent of the work being done. He also would have known that the restriction would not have been lifted without notice, and if it had been lifted early, the rules required the Civil Engineers to show the new permissible speed limit at the warning board, and they would not have removed the board completely and without warning. Instead, it was thought likely that McKay, in his haste to make up time following the earlier delay, temporarily forgot about the speed restriction without the reminder of the warning board during the vital few minutes in which the train passed the area.

McKay was later charged with manslaughter but found not guilty after a trial the following year.

A number of recommendations to prevent a recurrence of the accident were accepted by the British Railways Board, the main one being the installation of temporary Automatic Warning System magnets at speed restriction locations to ensure that drivers were given audible and visual notice of speed restrictions.

==Memorial==
A plaque commemorating the victims of the crash, as well as the actions of emergency services personnel, was unveiled at Nuneaton station in August 2015.

<text>Jacques Barraband (or Pierre-Paul Barraband) (1767? (baptized 1768), Aubusson (Creuse), France–1 October 1809, Lyon) was a French zoological and botanical illustrator, renowned for his lifelike renderings of tropical birds. His pictures were based on mounted specimens and his illustrations were considered the most accurate ones made during the early 1800s.

==Biography==

Barraband was born to Jacques Barraband and Marie-Anne Bebit in 1767 (or 1768) and was baptized on August 31, 1768, at the church of Sainte-Croix in Aubusson. His father worked in the local tapestry factory and the son also worked there briefly after studying art at the local school, which was famed for producing several artists of note, including Francis Roby de Faureix and Etienne de La Seiglière de La Cour. In 1784 or 1785 he moved to Paris, working at tapestry and carpet stores on rue de la Huchette and studying art at l’Academie royale de peinture under Joseph-Laurent Malaine, at the Gobelins Manufactory. During the French exposition of 1798, he produced some paintings for the carpet manufacturers Gobelins and Savonnerie and for the porcelain makers Dihl and Gerhard. He also made illustrations of insects for the French naturalist Sonnini and illustrated a book by Fournier on Egypt. He then produced a series of watercolours of birds and flowers between 1801 and 1804 by direct commission of Napoleon Bonaparte. Among his most famous works are those he made to illustrate François Le Vaillant&#x27;s scientific studies on parrots (&quot;perroquets&quot;), birds of paradise (&quot;oiseaux de paradis&quot;), rollers (&quot;rolliers&quot;), toucans (&quot;toucans&quot;), barbets (&quot;barbus&quot;), sugarbirds (&quot;promerops&quot;), bee-eaters (&quot;guêpiers&quot;), trogons (&quot;couroucous&quot;), and turacos (&quot;touracos&quot;). One of his students was Pauline Rifer de Courcelles who later married the artist Joseph August Knip. Pauline de Courcelles illustrated the birds in Histoire Naturelle de Tangaras, des Manakins et des Todiers by Anselme-Gaetan Desmarest (1805).

Napoleon I hired Barraband to decorate the banquet hall at St. Cloud.

He was appointed a professor at the school of Arts et Dessin de Lyon in 1807 and died two years later. His only daughter Adeline became a musician.
Works illustrated by Barraband for Le Vaillant include:
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des perroquets&quot;, Paris Levrault, Schoell &amp; Cie, An IX-XII (1801–1805), 2 volumes. vol. 1 , vol. 2 
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de paradis et des rolliers, suivie de celles des toucans et des barbus&quot;, Paris, Denné le jeune &amp; Perlet, (1801–1806), 2 volumes.
* &quot;Histoire naturelle des promérops et des guêpiers (et des couroucous et touracos, faisant suite à celle des oiseaux de paradis)&quot;, Paris Levrault, (1806) 1807, (1816 ou 1818) 3 volumes.

Barraband worked with Louis Bouquet and Langlois to create the engravings of birds. These plates were inked, &quot;à la poupée&quot;, that is the plate had different parts inked as needed and pressed to paper just once. Tone and shading corrections were done to the plates by hand.

A monument was erected in his memory at the Lyons cemetery by his students.

<text>Rodney Lee Parsley (born January 13, 1957) is an American Christian minister, author, television host and evangelist. He is senior pastor of World Harvest Church, a large nondenominational church in Canal Winchester, Ohio; a suburb of Columbus, which has a sister campus in Elkhart, Indiana.

Parsley is the founder and chancellor of Valor Christian College. He is the founder and president of The Center for Moral Clarity, a Christian grassroots advocacy organization, as well as the founder of Breakthrough (a media ministry), the Bridge of Hope missions organization, Harvest Preparatory School, World Harvest Ministerial Alliance, The Women&#x27;s Clinic of Columbus, and , a 24/7 online streaming channel. His television program, &quot;Breakthrough with Rod Parsley&quot;, airs daily on the Daystar TV Network, and The Word Network.

==Early life and education==
Parsley was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and was raised primarily in the Columbus area. His parents had grown up in eastern Kentucky, and his family traveled there often to visit relatives when Parsley was a young boy. He still speaks with a noticeable Kentucky accent.

Parsley was raised as a Free Will Baptist. At 8 years old, Parsley had a salvation experience during a revival in a small Pentecostal church outside of Columbus. As a teenager, Parsley encountered the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at Christian Center Church in Gahanna, Ohio, Giving him a wider perspective of the church and his eventual call to the ministry

After graduating from high school, he worked in real estate and at a pet-food factory. Through a series of various events, Parsley made the decision go into the work of ministry. He enrolled at Circleville Bible College (now Ohio Christian University), but dropped out after two years.

As a young pastor, Parsley was strongly influenced by Lester Sumrall, an Indiana-based evangelist, missionary and broadcaster. Sumrall became Parsley&#x27;s mentor, and the two traveled together often. 

== Personal life ==
He is married to Joni Parsley. They have a son, Austin, and a daughter, Ashton. They live near Pickerington, a suburb of Columbus.

==World Harvest Church==

Parsley founded his church in 1977, after leading a Bible study in his parents&#x27; backyard while still a college student. Seventeen people attended the first meeting. They soon decided that the Bible study group should become a church. It originally became known as Sonrise Chapel, and later Word of Life Church.

The church&#x27;s first permanent facility was built in 1979. This is now known as Alpha Hall, one of four buildings on what for many years was the campus of Valor Christian College (the college moved to the main church campus in 2011). Growth soon required an addition to that building, and several years later the church built a bigger structure adjacent to Alpha Hall, now known as Dominion Hall. In 1986, ground was broken on to begin what is now the church&#x27;s main campus in Canal Winchester (with a Columbus address). When it was dedicated, it was renamed as World Harvest Church in honor of Lester Sumrall, who had befriended Parsley years earlier and became the younger pastor&#x27;s mentor and spiritual father.

World Harvest Church Columbus now includes a 5,200-seat sanctuary, children&#x27;s and youth ministries, Connect Centers and administrative offices. Harvest Preparatory School, a private Christian school serving students in preschool through grade 12, and Valor Christian College also operate on the church grounds. About 10,000 people attend services at World Harvest on a weekly basis.

In 2013, World Harvest added a satellite campus in Elkhart. That church is located near Christian Center Church in South Bend, the church founded by Parsley&#x27;s mentor, Sumrall.

==Other ministry activities==
&quot;Breakthrough&quot; is an outreach of Bridge of Hope, an international missions organization. Over the past 20 years, Parsley has led numerous humanitarian projects around the world, supported by gifts from his church members, churches affiliated with the World Harvest Ministerial Alliance and television viewers. Bridge of Hope has an exhaustive record of work in Sudan, where a civil war has persisted for years. His involvement with Sudan began with his lobbying for the federal Sudan Peace Act, and has encompassed the purchase of freedom for Sudanese Christian slaves as well as food, medical supplies and equipment for freed slaves. Bridge of Hope has purchased the freedom of more than 31,000 slaves and provided more than 16,000 &quot;survival kits&quot; — aid packages consisting of a tarp, mosquito netting, a cooking pot and food to sustain a family for a month.

Bridge of Hope has also completed projects in the African nations of Zambia, Uganda, Kenya and Mozambique. The organization&#x27;s history also includes projects in Europe, Asia, South America, Central America and the Caribbean. its most recent international projects have been in Haiti (both before and after the January 2010 earthquake there) and Guatemala.

Domestically, Bridge of Hope has been involved in disaster relief, providing food, water, ice and cleaning supplies in the wake of disasters including Hurricanes Katrina, Gustav and Ike. Following these disasters, Bridge of Hope was named a First Responder by FEMA.

Valor Christian College was founded in 1990 as World Harvest Bible Institute, and was later known as World Harvest Bible College. It attracts students from across the United States and around the world for ministry training in pastoral leadership, missions, evangelism, music ministry, youth ministry, media ministry, advanced leadership and interdisciplinary studies. It is accredited by the Ohio Department of Higher Education to offer associate of applied science degrees.

Parsley is also the host of Dominion Camp-Meeting, an annual summer conference held on the World Harvest Church campus. The conference attracts thousands of christians from all around the world and has served as a global platform to well-known speakers such as Bishop T.D. Jakes, Joyce Meyer, Steven Furtick, Juanita Bynum, and many others

==Political activism==
Parsley is a political independent. He is a critic of liberal positions on social issues, including abortion and the movement to expand the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples. He has also worked on behalf of prison re-entry legislation, women&#x27;s rights initiatives and anti-poverty programs. His most recent book, &quot;Living on Our Heads&quot;, singles out Chris Matthews, Bart Stupak, Mia Farrow and the late Christopher Hitchens for praise.

Parsley became increasingly involved in U.S. politics following his work on the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. During the summer of 2004, Parsley announced the establishment of the Center for Moral Clarity. He openly criticized Sweden for the conviction of Åke Green under Sweden&#x27;s hate crimes legislation.

On October 3, 2004, Parsley gave a sermon titled &quot;Uncensored: While Freedom Still Rings&quot;. In the two-part sermon, Parsley expressed opposition to the view that there is a separation of church and state in the U.S. Constitution; same-sex marriage; partial-birth abortion; hate speech legislation in California, Canada, and Sweden; sexual orientation themes in children&#x27;s books; racism; and poverty. Parsley has said that the U.S. government, by funding Planned Parenthood, is complicit in black genocide, that is, genocide against African Americans, because Planned Parenthood performs abortions in the black community.

A few weeks before the 2004 elections, Parsley encouraged both his congregation and his television audience to vote for Ohio&#x27;s state constitutional amendment which defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. The amendment passed by a wide margin of votes from both political parties. Parsley has also encouraged citizens of other states with similar marriage amendments on their ballots to vote similarly, and he headlined the &quot;Silent No More&quot; tour in order to register Christian voters.

==Writings==
Parsley is an author of several books, including &quot;Silent No More&quot;, which was released in April 2005 by Charisma House. The book encourages Christians to participate in the political process, and especially to make sure their votes reflect their values. Concerning poverty, Parsley writes that government should &quot;get out of the way,&quot; removing many constraints on capitalism. &quot;If the government were to reduce the level of taxation, remove industrial restraints, eliminate wage controls, and abolish subsidies, tariffs, and other constraints on free enterprise,&quot; he writes, &quot;the poor would be helped in a way that AFDC, social security, and unemployment insurance could never match.&quot;

The sequel, &quot;Culturally Incorrect: How Clashing Worldviews Affect Your Future&quot;, was published in June 2007 and soon appeared on the industry&#x27;s best-seller lists. &quot;Culturally Incorrect&quot; identifies postmodernism - the belief that there is no such thing as absolute truth - as the cause of many of the culture&#x27;s major ills, and calls upon Christians to impact the culture through prayer, service to the poor and activism. A third book on Christian moral action, &quot;Living on Our Heads: Righting an Upside-Down Culture&quot;, was released in August 2010.

His latest book is called &quot;Grace: Uncovered, Unfiltered, Undeserved&quot;, released in November 2018.

==McCain 2008 endorsement==
Parsley personally endorsed the presidential campaign of Republican nominee John McCain, who called Parsley a &quot;spiritual guide&quot;. McCain had actively sought Parsley&#x27;s endorsement during his Republican primary battle with Mike Huckabee, who was drawing substantial support from the religious right.

McCain later rejected Parsley&#x27;s endorsement based on Parsley&#x27;s statements regarding Islam. Parsley was quoted as stating that he &quot;do[es] not believe that our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed&quot; and that Muhammad is &quot;the mouthpiece of a conspiracy of spiritual evil&quot;.

In repudiating Parsley&#x27;s comments, McCain stated, &quot;I believe there is no place for that kind of dialogue in America, and I believe that even though he endorsed me, and I didn&#x27;t endorse him, the fact is that I repudiate such talk, and I reject his endorsement.&quot; McCain further distanced himself from Parsley, stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been in Pastor Hagee&#x27;s church or Pastor Parsley&#x27;s church. I didn&#x27;t attend their church for 20 years, and I&#x27;m not a member of their church. I received their endorsement, which did not mean that I endorsed their views.&quot;

Thereafter, Parsley withdrew his endorsement of McCain&#x27;s candidacy.

==Criticism of Parsley==
Parsley has been identified as a prominent player in the so-called dominionist movement by both TheocracyWatch and commentator Bill Moyers.

Some have criticized Parsley&#x27;s book, &quot;Silent No More&quot;, because of the book&#x27;s description of Islam and its view that the United States Constitution provides for a separation of church and state (among other social issues), and for his support of faith healing. Parsley supports the claim that Islam is an enemy of both the United States and Christianity.

In January 2006, a group of 31 Columbus, Ohio-area pastors charged that Parsley and another central Ohio religious leader had violated federal tax laws. The complaining clergy alleged that Parsley violated the tax-exempt status of his church by supporting various political causes.

Author Chris Hedges&#x27; 2006 book &quot;American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America&quot; quoted Parsley as using militaristic metaphors in a sermon concerning his critics:

==Cancer==
In 2015, Parsley was treated for vocal cord cancer, but has since recovered.

<text>Expo 58, also known as the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (; ), was a world&#x27;s fair held on the Heysel/Heizel Plateau in Brussels, Belgium, from 17 April to 19 October 1958. It was the first major world&#x27;s fair registered under the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) after World War II and the fifth in Brussels overall.

Expo 58 left a deep impression on Belgium. It was also the pretext for major upheavals and works in Brussels, whose boulevards were transformed into urban motorways. The Atomium, built for the occasion, has become one of the city&#x27;s must-see landmarks.

==Background==
Expo 58 was the eleventh world&#x27;s fair hosted by Belgium, and the fifth in Brussels, following the fairs in 1888, 1897, 1910 and 1935. In 1953, Belgium won the bid for the next world&#x27;s fair, winning out over other European capitals such as Paris and London.

Nearly 15,000 workers spent three years building the site on the Heysel/Heizel Plateau, north-west of central Brussels. Many of the buildings were re-used from the 1935 World&#x27;s Fair, which had been held on the same site.

The theme of Expo 58 was &quot;Bilan du monde, pour un monde plus humain&quot; (in English: &quot;Evaluation of the world for a more humane world&quot;), a motto inspired by faith in technical and scientific progress, as well as post-war debates over the ethical use of atomic power.

The exhibition attracted some 41.5 million visitors, making Expo 58 the second largest World&#x27;s Fair after the 1900 &quot;Exposition Universelle et Internationale de Paris,&quot; which had attracted 48 million visitors. Every 25 years starting in 1855, Belgium had staged large national events to celebrate its national independence following the Belgian Revolution of 1830. However, the Belgian Government under Prime Minister Achille Van Acker decided to forego celebrations in 1955 to have additional funding for the 1958 Expo. Since Expo 58, Belgium has not organised any more world&#x27;s fairs.

==Exhibition==

===Overview===
More than forty nations took part in Expo 58, with more than forty-five national pavilions, not including those of the Belgian Congo and Belgium itself.

The site is best known for the Atomium, a giant model of a unit cell of an iron crystal (each sphere representing an atom). During the 1958 European exposition, the molecular model hosted an observation of more than forty-one million visitors while refining an astonishment for atomism by distant global communities. The atomistic model was opened with a call for world peace and social and economic progress, issued by King Baudouin I. The Atomium was originally foreseen to last only the six months of the exhibition; but it was never taken down, its outer coating was renewed on the 50th anniversary of the exhibition, and it stands nowadays as just as much an emblem of Brussels as the Eiffel Tower is of Paris.

Notable exhibitions include the Philips Pavilion, where &quot;Poème électronique&quot;, commissioned specifically for the location, was played back from 425 loudspeakers, placed at specific points as designed by Iannis Xenakis, and Le Corbusier.

===Belgian Congo Section===
The Belgian Congo section was located in in close proximity to the Atomium model. The Belgian Congo, today known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was at that time a Belgian colonial holding. Expo organizers also included participants from the UN Trust Territories of Ruanda-Urundi (today, Rwanda and Burundi) in the Belgian Congo section, without differentiation. This section was divided into seven pavilions: the Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi Palace, agriculture; Catholic missions; insurance, banks, trade; mines and metallurgy; energy, construction, and transport; a &quot;village indigène&quot; (indigenous village). The Belgian Congo section was, above all, intended to display the &quot;civilizing&quot; work of the Belgian colonialism. The &quot;village indigène&quot; is of the most notable modern &quot;human zoos&quot; of the 20th century.

====Human zoo====
Another exhibition at the Belgian pavilion was the Congolese village that some have branded a human zoo.

The Ministry of Colonies built the Congolese exhibit, intending to demonstrate their claim to have &quot;civilized&quot; the &quot;primitive Africans.&quot; Native Congolese art was rejected for display, as the Ministry claimed it was &quot;insufficiently Congolese.&quot; Instead, nearly all of the art on display was created by Europeans in a purposefully primitive and imitative style, and the entrance of the exhibit featured a bust of King Leopold II, under whose colonial rule millions of Congolese died. The 700 Congolese chosen to be exhibited by the Ministry were educated urbanites referred to by Belgians as &quot;évolués&quot;, meaning literally &quot;evolved,&quot; but were made to dress in &quot;primitive&quot; clothing, and an armed guard blocked them from communicating with white Belgians who came to observe them. The exotic nature of the exhibit was lauded by visitors and international press, with the Belgian socialist newspaper &quot;Le Peuple&quot; praising the portrayal of Africans, saying it was &quot;in complete agreement with historical truth.&quot; However, in mid-July the Congolese protested the condescending treatment they were receiving from spectators and demanded to be sent home, abruptly ending the exhibit and eliciting some sympathy from European newspapers.

==National pavilions==

===Austria===
The Austrian pavilion was designed by Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer in modernist style. It was later transferred to Vienna to host the museum of the 20th century. In 2011 it was reopened under the new name 21er Haus. It included a model Austrian Kindergarten, which doubled as a day care facility for the employees, the Vienna Philharmonic playing behind glass, and a model nuclear fusion reactor that fired every 5 minutes.

===Czechoslovakia===
The exposition &quot;One Day in Czechoslovakia&quot; was designed by Jindřich Santar who cooperated with artists Jiří Trnka, Antonín Kybal, Stanislav Libenský and Jan Kotík. Architects of the simple, but modern and graceful construction were František Cubr, Josef Hrubý and Zdeněk Pokorný. The team&#x27;s artistic freedom, so rare in the hard-line communist regime of the 1950s, was ensured by the government committee for exhibitions chairman František Kahuda. He supported the famous Laterna Magika show, as well as Josef Svoboda&#x27;s technically unique &quot;Polyekran&quot;. The Czechoslovak pavilion was visited by 6 million people and was officially awarded the best pavilion of the Expo 58.

===Federal Republic of Germany===
The West German pavilion was designed by the architects Egon Eiermann and Sep Ruf. The world press called it the most polished and sophisticated pavilion of the exhibition.

===Hungary===
Hungary was represented by a large modular modernist pavilion designed by the architect Lajos Gádoros. The scenario for the exhibition was compiled by the writer Iván Boldizsár. It hosted a mix of early-1900s paintings by Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka, József Egry and Gyula Derkovitz, and modern ones such as the &quot;Life in Budapest&quot; fresco painted on aluminium panels by Túry Mária and Kádár György. In the entrance hall hung József Somogyi and Kerényi Jenő&#x27;s dynamic statue group &quot;Dancers&quot;, which won a Grand Prix, and was later bought by the city of Namur. Margit Kovács&#x27; sculpture &quot;The Spinner&quot; was also on display. 

The exhibition took place during very turbulent times for Hungary. The decision to participate was made in 1955, under the Stalinist party leader Mátyás Rákosi, shortly after he got rid of his reformist prime minister Imre Nagy. By the time the exhibition closed in 1958, the party leader was exiled, and the prime minister was tried and executed.

===Liechtenstein===
The Liechtenstein pavilion featured a bronze bust of Franz Joseph II at the entrance, a collection of weapons, stamps, and important historical documents from the Principality, paintings from the Prince&#x27;s personal collection, and exhibits showcasing Liechtenstein&#x27;s industry, landscape, and religious history. Also featured in the building was an interior garden with a circular walkway enabling visitors to browse the entire pavilion.

===Mexico===
The Mexican pavilion was designed by the architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez. It was awarded the exposition&#x27;s star of gold.

===City of Paris===
The city of Paris had its own pavilion, separate from the French exhibit.

===United Kingdom===
The UK pavilion was produced by the designer James Gardner, architect Howard Lobb and engineer Felix Samuely. The on-site British architect was Michael Blower, Brussels born and bilingual.

===USSR===
The Soviet pavilion was a large impressive building which was folded up and taken back to Russia when Expo 58 ended. There was a bookstore selling science and technology books in English and other languages published by the Moscow Press.

The exhibit featured a celestial mechanics display of the experimental Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 prototypes placed into orbit during the International Geophysical Year. The robotic spacecraft was low earth orbital satellite which debuted as the Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 for an international spectators observation from the surface of the earth. The spacecraft completed the geocentric orbit upon depleting the silver zinc battery capacity for an atmospheric entry of the earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 4 January 1958.

The exposition highlighted a model of the Soviet Union&#x27;s watercraft vessel &quot;Lenin&quot; the first nuclear-powered icebreaker, and Soviet automobiles: GAZ-21 Volga, GAZ-13 Chaika, ZIL-111, Moskvitch 407 and 423, trucks GAZ-53 and MAZ-525. The Soviet exposition was awarded with a Grand Prix.

===United States===
The US pavilion was quite spacious and included a fashion show with models walking down a large spiral staircase, an electronic computer that demonstrated a knowledge of history, and a colour television studio behind glass. It also served as the concert venue for performance by the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Edward Lee Alley. It was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone. It would also play host to the University of California Marching Band which had financed its own way to the fair under the direction of James Berdahl. The United States pavilion consisted of 4 buildings, one of which hosted America the Beautiful, a 360° movie attraction in Circarama made by Walt Disney Productions. The film would subsequently travel to the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959, and would find its first American audiences at Disneyland in Anaheim in 1960.

===Yugoslavia===
The government of Yugoslavia was among the first to accept the Expo 58 invitation in November 1954. The exhibition was seen as an opportunity to showcase the country, its delineation from the Soviet Union, independent socioeconomic system and international profile, as well as the impact of these policies on the cultural and artistic life. The content was curated by the architect Branislav Kojić and the writer and art-critic Oto Bihalji-Merin. 

The modernist pavilion was designed by the architect Vjenceslav Richter, who originally proposed to suspend the whole structure from a giant cable-stayed mast. When that proved too complicated, Richter devised a tension column consisting of six steel arches supported by a pre-stressed cable, which stood in front of the pavilion as a visual marker and symbolised Yugoslavia&#x27;s six constituent republics. 

It housed four galleries:
* Economy – focused on non-ferrous metals and hydroelectric potential of the country with some industrial design items such as Rex chairs;
* State and Social Organisation – concentrated on the country&#x27;s history, WW2 resistance, self-management and co-operatives in agriculture;
* Contemporary Art – naïve and modernist paintings and sculptures including works by Vojin Bakić (&quot;The Bull&quot;), Krsto Hegedušić, Miodrag Protić, Gabrijel Stupica and others;
* Tourism – including large photographs of the country&#x27;s natural beauty spots and a collection of 55 dolls dressed in traditional costumes.

The pavilion was praised for its elegance and simplicity and Richter was awarded as Knight of the Order of the Belgian Crown. After the end of Expo 58, it was sold and reconstructed as a school, , in the Belgian municipality of Wevelgem, where it still stands.

===Other pavilions===
==Transport==

* As many visitors were expected, SABENA temporarily increased capacity by renting a couple of Lockheed Constellations.
* For the same reason, and well in time, it was decided to add a new terminal to the Melsbroek national airport; it was to be at the west side of the airport, on the grounds of the municipality of Zaventem, which has since given its name to the airport. A very modern addition was the railway station in the airport, offering direct train service to the city centre, though not to the expo itself.
* Several tram lines were built to serve the site, those to Brussels remain in service. One line (81) was temporarily deviated to go all the way through Brussels with endpoints at both ends of the Expo.

==Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; incident==
The autograph of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; was placed on display. At some point, someone was able to gain access to the manuscript, tearing off the bottom right-hand corner of the second to last page (folio 99r/45r), containing the words &quot;Quam olim d: C:&quot;. the perpetrator has not been identified and the fragment has not been recovered.

==International film poll==
The event offered the occasion for the organization by thousands of critics and filmmakers from all over the world, of the first universal film poll in history. The poll received nominations from 117 critics from 26 nations. &quot;Броненосец Потёмкин (Battleship Potemkin)&quot; received 100 votes with &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; second with 95.

A jury of young filmmakers (Robert Aldrich, Satyajit Ray, Alexandre Astruc, Michael Cacoyannis, Juan Bardem, Francesco Maselli and Alexander Mackendrick) were due to select a winner from the nominees but voted not to. Instead they indicated the following as still holding value to young filmmakers: &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;; &quot;Grand Illusion&quot;; &quot;Mother&quot;; &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;; &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; and &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.

==Commemoration==
* The logo for Expo 58 was designed by Lucien De Roeck, and posters based on it were produced by De Roeck and by Leo Marfurt
* The 50th anniversary of Expo 58 was selected as the main motif of a high-value collectors&#x27; coin: the Belgian €100 50th Anniversary of the International Expo in Belgium commemorative coin, minted in 2008. In the obverse, the logo of the event is depicted together with the number 50, representing its 50th anniversary.

<text>&quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; is an American children&#x27;s counting out rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 12976. In 1868, songwriter Septimus Winner adapted it as a song, then called &quot;Ten Little Injuns&quot;, for a minstrel show.

==Lyrics==

The modern lyrics for the children&#x27;s rhyme are:

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&#x27; { \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 120 \key c \major \time 4/4

Four lit -- tle, five lit -- le, six lit -- tle In -- di -- ans,
Se -- ven lit -- tle, eight lit -- le, nine lit -- tle In -- di -- ans,
Ten lit -- tle In -- di -- an boys }
&lt;/score&gt;

==Minstrel song==
Songwriter Septimus Winner created an elaborated version of the children&#x27;s song, called &quot;Ten Little Injuns&quot;, in 1868 for a minstrel show.

==Derivative songs and books==
It is generally thought that this song was adapted, possibly by Frank J. Green in 1869, as &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot;, though it is possible that the influence was the other way around, with &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot; being a close reflection of the text that became &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;. Either way, &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot; became a standard of the blackface minstrel shows. It was sung by Christy&#x27;s Minstrels and became widely known in Europe, where it was used by Agatha Christie in her 1939 novel of the same name, about ten killings on a remote island. The novel was later retitled &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; for the American edition, although the original title remained in use for the UK publication until 1985, and it remains one of her most famous works. The Spanish and Russian titles of Christie&#x27;s novel today are still &quot;Diez negritos&quot; and «Десять негритят», respectively, and the German children&#x27;s song, with a different melody, is called &quot;Zehn kleine Negerlein&quot;.

Variants of this song have been published widely as children&#x27;s books; what the variants have in common is &#x27;that they are about dark-skinned boys who are always children, never learning from experience&#x27;. For example, it had been published in the Netherlands by 1913; in Denmark by 1922 (in &quot;Börnenes billedbog&quot;); in Iceland in 1922 (as &quot;Negrastrákarnir&quot;); and in Finland in the 1940s (in &quot;Kotoa ja kaukaa: valikoima runosatuja lapsille&quot; and &quot;Hupaisa laskukirja&quot;). The Bengali poem &quot;Haradhon er Dosti Chhele&quot; (&quot;Haradhon&#x27;s Ten Sons&quot;) is also inspired by &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;.

===Criticism of racist language===
Because of changing sensibilities over the words used, modern versions for children often use &quot;aeroplanes&quot;, &quot;soldier boys&quot; or &quot;teddy bears&quot; as the objects of the rhyme, among others. Icelandic publisher Skrudda&#x27;s unaltered republication in 2007 of the 1922 Icelandic version of &quot;Ten Little Negroes&quot; caused considerable debate in that country, with a strong division between those who saw the book as racist and those who saw it as &quot;a part of funny and silly stories created in the past&quot;. In Kristín Loftsdóttir&#x27;s assessment of the debate, she states:

The republishing of the book in Iceland triggered a number of parodies or rewritings: &quot;Tíu litlír kenjakrakkar&quot; (&quot;Ten little prankster-children&quot;) by Sigrún Eldjárn and Þórarinn Eldjárn; &quot;10 litlir sveitastrákar&quot; (&quot;Ten little country-boys&quot;) by Katrín J. Óskarsdóttir and Guðrún Jónína Magnúsdóttir; and &quot;Tíu litlir bankastrákar&quot; (&quot;Ten little banker-boys&quot;) by Óttar M. Njorðfjörð.

===1945 version===
The following version of the song was included in the first film version of &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1945), which largely took Green&#x27;s lyrics and replaced the already sensitive word &quot;nigger&quot; with &quot;Indian&quot;:

<doc id="1194257" wikidata="Q387585" url="?curid=1194257" title="Gomphothere">
<text>Gomphotheres are an extinct group of proboscideans related to modern elephants. First appearing in Africa during the Oligocene, they dispersed into Eurasia and North America during the Miocene and arrived in South America during the Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. Gomphotheres are a paraphyletic group ancestral to Elephantidae, which contains modern elephants, as well as Stegodontidae. 

While most famous forms such as &quot;Gomphotherium&quot; had long lower jaws with tusks, the ancestral condition for the group, some later members developed shortened (brevirostrine) lower jaws with either vestigial or no lower tusks and outlasted the long-jawed gomphotheres. This change made them look very similar to modern elephants, an example of parallel evolution. During the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene, the diversity of gomphotheres declined, ultimately becoming extinct outside of the Americas. The last two genera, &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; ranging southern North America to western South America, and &quot;Notiomastodon&quot; ranging over most of South America, continued to exist until the end of the Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago, when they became extinct along with many other megafauna species following the arrival of humans.

The name &quot;gomphothere&quot; comes from Ancient Greek (), &quot;peg, pin; wedge; joint&quot; plus (), &quot;beast&quot;.

==Description==
Gomphotheres differed from elephants in their tooth structure, particularly the chewing surfaces on the molar teeth. The teeth are considered to be bunodont, that is, having rounded rather than sharp cusps. They are thought to have chewed differently from modern elephants, using an oblique movement (combining back to front and side to side motion) over the teeth rather than the proal movement (a forwards stroke from the back to the front of the lower jaws) used by modern elephants and stegodontids, with this oblique movement being combined with vertical (orthal) motion that served to crush food. Like modern elephants and other members of Elephantimorpha, gomphotheres had horizontal tooth replacement, where teeth would progressively migrate towards the front of the jaws before they were taken place by more posterior teeth. Unlike modern elephants, many gomphotheres retained permanent premolar teeth though they were absent in some gomphothere genera.

Early gomphotheres had lower jaws with an elongate (longitostrine) mandibular symphysis (the front-most part of the lower jaw) and lower tusks, the primitive condition for members of Elephantimorpha. Later members developed shortened (brevirostrine) lower jaws and/or vestigial or no lower tusks, a convergent process that occurred multiple times among gomphotheres, as well as other members of Elephantimorpha. In Gomphotheriidae, these elongate mandibular symphysis tend to be narrow, while the lower tusks tend to be club shaped. While the musculature of the trunk of longirostrine gomphotheres was likely very similar to that of living elephants, the trunk was likely shorter (probably no longer than the tips of the lower tusks), and rested upon the elongate lower jaw, though the trunks of later brevirostrine gomphotheres were likely free hanging and comparable to those of living elephants in length. The lower tusks and long lower jaws of primitive gomphotheres were likely used for cutting vegetation, with a secondary contribution in acquiring food using the trunk, while brevirostrine gomphotheres relied primarily on their trunks to acquire food similar to modern elephants. The upper tusks of primitive longirostrine gomphotheres typically gently curve downwards, and generally do not exceed in length and in weight, though some later brevirostine gomphotheres developed considerably larger upper tusks. Upper tusks of brevirostine gomphotheres include those which are straight and upwardly curved.

Most gomphotheres reached sizes equivalent to those of those of the modern Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;), though some gomphotheres reached sizes comparable to or somewhat exceeding African bush elephants (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;). The limb bones of gomphotheres like those of mammutids are generally more robust than elephantids, with the legs also tending to be proportionally shorter. Their bodies also tend to be more proportionally elongate than those of living elephants, resulting in gomphotheres being heavier than an elephant at the same shoulder height.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Gomphotheres&quot; are assigned to their own family, Gomphotheriidae, but are widely agreed to be a paraphyletic group. The families Choerolophodontidae and Amebelodontidae (the latter of which includes &quot;shovel tuskers&quot; with flattened lower tusks like &quot;Platybelodon&quot;) are sometimes considered gomphotheres &quot;sensu lato,&quot; though some authors argue that Amebelodontidae should be sunk into Gomphotheriidae. Gomphotheres are divided into two informal groups, &quot;trilophodont gomphotheres&quot;, and &quot;tetralophodont gomphotheres&quot;. &quot;Tetralophodont gomphotheres&quot; are distinguished from &quot;trilophodont gomphotheres&quot; by the presence of four ridges on the fourth premolar and on the first and second molars, rather than the three present in trilophodont gomphotheres. Some authors choose to exclude &quot;tetralophodont gomphotheres&quot; from Gomphotheriidae, and instead assign them to the group Elephantoidea. &quot;Tetralophodont gomphotheres&quot; are thought to have evolved from &quot;trilophodont gomphotheres&quot;, and are suggested to be ancestral to Elephantidae, the group which contains modern elephants, as well as Stegodontidae.

While the North American long jawed proboscideans &quot;Gnathabelodon&quot;, &quot;Eubelodon&quot; and &quot;Megabelodon&quot; been assigned to Gomphotheriidae in some studies other studies suggest that they should be assigned to Amebelodontidae (&quot;Eubelodon, Megabelodon&quot;) or Choerolophodontidae (&quot;Gnathabelodon&quot;).

== Ecology ==
Gomphotheres are generally supposed to have been flexible feeders, with the various species having differing browsing, mixed feeding and grazing diets, with the dietary preference of individual species and populations being shaped by local factors such as climatic conditions and competition. Analysis of the tusks of a male &quot;Notiomastodon&quot; individual suggest that it underwent musth, similar to modern elephants. &quot;Notiomastiodon&quot; is also suggested to have lived in social family groups, like modern elephants.

== Evolutionary history ==
Gomphotheres originated in Afro-Arabia during the mid-Oligocene, with remains from the Shumaysi Formation in Saudi Arabia dating to around 29-28 million years ago. Gomphotheres were uncommon in Afro-Arabia during the Oligocene. Gomphotheres arrived in Eurasia after the connection of Afro-Arabia and Eurasia during the Early Miocene around 19 million years ago, in what is termed the &quot;Proboscidean Datum Event&quot;. &quot;Gomphotherium&quot; arrived in North America around 16 million years ago, and is suggested to be the ancestor of later New World gomphothere genera. &quot;Trilophodont gomphotheres&quot; dramatically declined during the Late Miocene, likely due to the increasing C4 grass-dominated habitats, while during the Late Miocene &quot;tetralophodont gomphotheres&quot; were abundant and widespread in Eurasia, where they represented the dominant group of proboscideans. All trilophodont gomphotheres, with the exception of the Asian &quot;Sinomastodon&quot;, became extinct in Eurasia by the beginning of the Pliocene,&quot;&quot; along with the global extinction of the &quot;shovel tusker&quot; amebelodontids. The last gomphotheres in Africa, represented by the &quot;tetralophodont gomphothere&quot; genus &quot;Anancus&quot;, became extinct around the end of the Pliocene and beginning of the Pleistocene. The New World gomphothere genera &quot;Notiomastodon&quot; and &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; dispersed into South America during the Pleistocene, around or after 2.5 million years ago as part of the Great American Biotic Interchange due to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, becoming widespread across the continent. The last gomphothere native to Europe, &quot;Anancus arvernensis&quot; became extinct during the Early Pleistocene, around 1.6–2 million years ago &quot;Sinomastodon&quot; became extinct at the end of the Early Pleistocene, around 800,000 years ago. From the latter half of the Early Pleistocene onwards, gomphotheres were extirpated from most of North America, likely due to competition with mammoths and mastodons.

The extinction of gomphotheres in Afro-Eurasia has generally been supposed to be the result the expansion of Elephantidae and &quot;Stegodon.&quot; The morphology of elephantid molars being more efficient than gomphotheres in consuming grass, which became more abundant during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs.&quot;&quot; In southern North America, Central America and South America, gomphotheres did not become extinct until shortly after the arrival of humans to the Americas, approximately 12,000 years ago, as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions of most large mammals across the Americas. Bones of the last gomphothere genera, &quot;Cuvieronius&quot; and &quot;Notiomastodon,&quot; dating to shortly before their extinction have been found associated with human artifacts, suggesting that hunting played a role in their extinction.

<text>An influence diagram (ID) (also called a relevance diagram, decision diagram or a decision network) is a compact graphical and mathematical representation of a decision situation. It is a generalization of a Bayesian network, in which not only probabilistic inference problems but also decision making problems (following the maximum expected utility criterion) can be modeled and solved.

ID was first developed in the mid-1970s by decision analysts with an intuitive semantic that is easy to understand. It is now adopted widely and becoming an alternative to the decision tree which typically suffers from exponential growth in number of branches with each variable modeled. ID is directly applicable in team decision analysis, since it allows incomplete sharing of information among team members to be modeled and solved explicitly. Extensions of ID also find their use in game theory as an alternative representation of the game tree.

==Semantics==

An ID is a directed acyclic graph with three types (plus one subtype) of node and three types of arc (or arrow) between nodes.

Nodes:
:*&quot;Decision node&quot; (corresponding to each decision to be made) is drawn as a rectangle.
:*&quot;Uncertainty node&quot; (corresponding to each uncertainty to be modeled) is drawn as an oval.
::*&quot;Deterministic node&quot; (corresponding to special kind of uncertainty that its outcome is deterministically known whenever the outcome of some other uncertainties are also known) is drawn as a double oval.
:*&quot;Value node&quot; (corresponding to each component of additively separable Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function) is drawn as an octagon (or diamond).

Arcs:
:*&quot;Functional arcs&quot; (ending in value node) indicate that one of the components of additively separable utility function is a function of all the nodes at their tails.
:*&quot;Conditional arcs&quot; (ending in uncertainty node) indicate that the uncertainty at their heads is probabilistically conditioned on all the nodes at their tails.
::*&quot;Conditional arcs&quot; (ending in deterministic node) indicate that the uncertainty at their heads is deterministically conditioned on all the nodes at their tails.
:*&quot;Informational arcs&quot; (ending in decision node) indicate that the decision at their heads is made with the outcome of all the nodes at their tails known beforehand.

Given a properly structured ID:
:*Decision nodes and incoming information arcs collectively state the &quot;alternatives&quot; (what can be done when the outcome of certain decisions and/or uncertainties are known beforehand)
:*Uncertainty/deterministic nodes and incoming conditional arcs collectively model the &quot;information&quot; (what are known and their probabilistic/deterministic relationships)
:*Value nodes and incoming functional arcs collectively quantify the &quot;preference&quot; (how things are preferred over one another).

&quot;Alternative, information, and preference&quot; are termed &quot;decision basis&quot; in decision analysis, they represent three required components of any valid decision situation.

Formally, the semantic of influence diagram is based on sequential construction of nodes and arcs, which implies a specification of all conditional independencies in the diagram. The specification is defined by the formula_1-separation criterion of Bayesian network. According to this semantic, every node is probabilistically 
independent on its non-successor nodes given the outcome of its immediate predecessor nodes. Likewise, a missing arc between non-value node formula_2 and non-value node formula_3 implies that there exists a set of non-value nodes formula_4, e.g., the parents of formula_3, that renders formula_3 independent of formula_2 given the outcome of the nodes in formula_4.

==Example==

Consider the simple influence diagram representing a situation where a decision-maker is planning their vacation.
:*There is 1 decision node (&quot;Vacation Activity&quot;), 2 uncertainty nodes (&quot;Weather Condition, Weather Forecast&quot;), and 1 value node (&quot;Satisfaction&quot;).
:*There are 2 functional arcs (ending in &quot;Satisfaction&quot;), 1 conditional arc (ending in &quot;Weather Forecast&quot;), and 1 informational arc (ending in &quot;Vacation Activity&quot;).

:*Functional arcs ending in &quot;Satisfaction&quot; indicate that &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a utility function of &quot;Weather Condition&quot; and &quot;Vacation Activity&quot;. In other words, their satisfaction can be quantified if they know what the weather is like and what their choice of activity is. (Note that they do not value &quot;Weather Forecast&quot; directly)
:*Conditional arc ending in &quot;Weather Forecast&quot; indicates their belief that &quot;Weather Forecast&quot; and &quot;Weather Condition&quot; can be dependent.
:*Informational arc ending in &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; indicates that they will only know &quot;Weather Forecast&quot;, not &quot;Weather Condition&quot;, when making their choice. In other words, actual weather will be known after they make their choice, and only forecast is what they can count on at this stage.

:*It also follows semantically, for example, that &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; is independent on (irrelevant to) &quot;Weather Condition&quot; given &quot;Weather Forecast&quot; is known.

==Applicability to value of information==

The above example highlights the power of the influence diagram in representing an extremely important concept in decision analysis known as the value of information. Consider the following three scenarios;
:*Scenario 1: The decision-maker could make their &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; decision while knowing what &quot;Weather Condition&quot; will be like. This corresponds to adding extra informational arc from &quot;Weather Condition&quot; to &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; in the above influence diagram.
:*Scenario 2: The original influence diagram as shown above.
:*Scenario 3: The decision-maker makes their decision without even knowing the &quot;Weather Forecast&quot;. This corresponds to removing informational arc from &quot;Weather Forecast&quot; to &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; in the above influence diagram.

Scenario 1 is the best possible scenario for this decision situation since there is no longer any uncertainty on what they care about (&quot;Weather Condition&quot;) when making their decision. Scenario 3, however, is the worst possible scenario for this decision situation since they need to make their decision without any hint (&quot;Weather Forecast&quot;) on what they care about (&quot;Weather Condition&quot;) will turn out to be.

The decision-maker is usually better off (definitely no worse off, on average) to move from scenario 3 to scenario 2 through the acquisition of new information. The most they should be willing to pay for such move is called the value of information on &quot;Weather Forecast&quot;, which is essentially the value of imperfect information on &quot;Weather Condition&quot;.

The applicability of this simple ID and the value of information concept is tremendous, especially in medical decision making when most decisions have to be made with imperfect information about their patients, diseases, etc.

==Related concepts==

Influence diagrams are hierarchical and can be defined either in terms of their structure or in greater detail in terms of the functional and numerical relation between diagram elements. An ID that is consistently defined at all levels—structure, function, and number—is a well-defined mathematical representation and is referred to as a &quot;well-formed influence diagram&quot; (WFID). WFIDs can be evaluated using reversal and removal operations to yield answers to a large class of probabilistic, inferential, and decision questions. More recent techniques have been developed by artificial intelligence researchers concerning Bayesian network inference (belief propagation).

An influence diagram having only uncertainty nodes (i.e., a Bayesian network) is also called a relevance diagram. An arc connecting node &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; implies not only that &quot;&quot;A&quot; is relevant to &quot;B&quot;, but also that &quot;B&quot; is relevant to &quot;A&quot;&quot; (i.e., relevance is a symmetric relationship).

<text>HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; was the second and last heavy cruiser built for the Royal Navy during the late 1920s. Aside from a temporary deployment with the Mediterranean Fleet during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935–1936, she spent the bulk of the 1930s assigned to the Atlantic Fleet or the North America and West Indies Station. When World War II began in September 1939, the cruiser was assigned to patrol South American waters against German commerce raiders. &quot;Exeter&quot; was one of three British cruisers that fought the German heavy cruiser , later that year in the Battle of the River Plate. She was severely damaged during the battle, and she was under repair for over a year.

After repairs were completed the ship spent most of 1941 on convoy escort duties before she was transferred to the Far East after the start of the Pacific War in December. &quot;Exeter&quot; was generally assigned to escorting convoys to and from Singapore during the Malayan Campaign, and she continued on those duties in early February 1942 as the Japanese prepared to invade the Dutch East Indies. Later that month, she was assigned to the Striking Force of the joint American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), and she took on a more active role in the defence of the Dutch East Indies. The culmination of this was her engagement in the Battle of the Java Sea later in the month as the Allies attempted to intercept several Imperial Japanese Navy invasion convoys. &quot;Exeter&quot; was crippled early in the battle, and she did not play much of a role as she withdrew. Two days later, she attempted to escape approaching Japanese forces, but she was intercepted and sunk by Japanese ships at the beginning of March in the Second Battle of the Java Sea.

Most of her crewmen survived the sinking and were rescued by the Japanese. About a quarter of them died during Japanese captivity. Her wreck was discovered in early 2007, and it was declared a war grave, but by 2016 her remains, along with other WWII wrecks, had been destroyed by illegal salvagers.

==Design and description==

&quot;Exeter&quot; was ordered two years after her sister ship and her design incorporated improvements in light of experience with the latter. Her beam was increased by to compensate for increases in topweight, and her boiler uptakes were trunked backwards from the boiler rooms, allowing for straight funnels further removed from the bridge rather than the raked funnels on &quot;York&quot; to ensure adequate dispersal of the flue gases. As the gun turrets had proved not strong enough to accommodate the aircraft catapult originally intended, &quot;Exeter&quot; was given a pair of fixed catapults angled out from amidships in a &quot;V&quot; shape, with the associated crane placed to starboard. Consequently, the bridge was lowered (that of &quot;York&quot; being tall to give a view over the intended aircraft), and was of a streamlined, enclosed design that was incorporated into later cruisers.

&quot;Exeter&quot; was slightly lighter than expected and displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She was powered by four Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The ship could carry of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 628 officers and ratings.

The main armament of the &quot;York&quot;-class ships consisted of six BL Mk VIII guns in three twin-gun turrets, designated &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot; from fore to aft. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were superfiring forward of the superstructure and &quot;Y&quot; was aft of it. Defence against aircraft was provided by four QF Mk V anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts amidships and a pair of two-pounder () light AA guns (&quot;pom-poms&quot;) in single mounts. The ships also fitted with two triple torpedo tube above-water mounts for  torpedoes.

The cruisers lacked a full-length waterline armour belt. The sides of &quot;Exeter&quot;″s boiler and engine rooms and the sides of the magazines were protected by of armour. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her propulsion machinery rooms were thick. The top of the magazines were protected by of armour and their ends were thick. The lower deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of .

===Modifications===

In 1932 &quot;Exeter&quot; had her side plating extended to enclose her open main deck as far back as the fore funnel. During that same refit, her pair of fixed catapults were finally installed for her Fairey IIIF floatplanes. In 1934–1935, two quadruple mounts for Vickers antiaircraft machineguns replaced the pair of two-pounder &quot;pom-poms&quot; originally installed.

While under repair in 1940–1941 after her battle with the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, the Royal Navy decided to upgrade her armament and fire-control systems. The bridge was rebuilt and enlarged to accommodate a second High-Angle Control System aft of the Director-Control Tower (DCT) on top of the bridge, her single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for Mark XVI guns of the same calibre and a pair of octuple mounts for two-pounder &quot;pom-poms&quot; were added abreast her aft superstructure. Enclosures (&quot;tubs&quot;) for single Oerlikon guns were added to the roof of both &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; turrets, but these weapons were never installed, because of shortages in production, and lighter tripod-mounted machine guns were substituted. The pole masts were replaced by stronger tripod masts because the Type 279 early-warning radar had separate transmitting and receiving aerials, one at each masthead. In addition, a Type 284 fire-control radar was fitted to the DCT.

==Construction and career==
===1928–1939===
&quot;Exeter&quot;, the fourth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was laid down on 1 August 1928, launched on 18 July 1929 and completed on 27 July 1931. The ship was then assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, where she served between 1931 and 1933. In 1934 she was assigned, along with sister ship , to the 8th Cruiser Squadron based at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, on the America and West Indies Station. She remained there, aside from a temporary deployment to the Mediterranean during the Abyssinian crisis of 1935–1936, until 1939.

After re-commissioning in England on 29 December 1936, &quot;Exeter&quot; departed two days later, returning to Bermuda via St. Vincent, in the Cape Verde Islands, Montevideo and Punta del Este in Uruguay (meeting and exercising with her sister and the light cruiser ), Rio de Janeiro and Ceará in Brazil, Barbados (where the three cruisers joined the remainder of the squadron), and Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. It was initially intended for the entire squadron to be at Bermuda to take part in the ceremony there for the 12 May 1937 Coronation of George VI and Elizabeth, but it was then decided to disperse the ships among the various colonies of the station, and &quot;Exeter&quot; left Bermuda on 6 May for Nassau, in the Bahamas, departed for Bermuda after taking part in the Bahamian parade. The ship had her bottom repainted at the dockyard in Bermuda at the end of May and her Royal Marine detachment conducted combined exercises with the Bermuda Garrison to practice raiding a hostile shore in June. The cruiser was scheduled to depart Bermuda on 21 June for a nine-month cruise, but the Governor of Trinidad signalled on 20 June for a cruiser to be sent to that colony due to riots that had broken out among strikers in the oil fields of Apex and Fyzabad, which had included the killings of two police officers. Workers in other industries had also staged sympathy strikes. &quot;Ajax&quot;, which was in Nassau at the time, was ordered to Trinidad and &quot;Exeter&quot; followed the next day. On 2 July the marines of &quot;Exeter&quot; joined with those of &quot;Ajax&quot; and two-hundred police constables to assault the village of Fyzabad. The ship&#x27;s marines were withdrawn on 5 July after the situation in Trinidad had stabilised, and the heavy cruiser departed immediately for Balboa, Panama to continue its summer (Southern Hemisphere &quot;winter&quot;) cruise, which took her through the Panama Canal, up the Pacific coast of North America to HMCS Naden (the old Royal Naval Dockyard, Esquimalt), via San Diego, California. &quot;Exeter&quot;″s return trip took her to both coasts of South America before arriving at Bermuda on 28 March 1938 together with the light cruiser . The German sail training ship &quot;Horst Wessel&quot; visited Bermuda from 21 to 25 May and the crew of &quot;Exeter&quot; hosted the German cadets during their stay.

===Second World War===
====Battle of the River Plate====
At the outbreak of World War II, she remained part of the South American Division with the &quot;Ajax&quot;. The division was transferred to the South Atlantic Station, with the addition of the heavy cruiser , under Commodore Henry Harwood. The ship, commanded by Captain Frederick Bell, was assigned to Force G to hunt for German commerce raiders off the eastern coast of South America on 6 October 1939. Two months later, Harwood ordered &quot;Exeter&quot; and the light cruiser to rendezvous with his own &quot;Ajax&quot; off the mouth of the Río de la Plata, while the heavy cruiser &quot;Cumberland&quot; was refitting in the Falkland Islands. The two other ships arrived on 12 December, and then the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; spotted the &quot;Exeter&quot; during the following morning.

Captain Hans Langsdorff decided to engage the British and closed at full speed. The British doctrine on how to engage ships like the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; had been developed by Harwood in 1936 and specified that the British force act as two divisions. Following this procedure, &quot;Exeter&quot; operated as a division on her own while &quot;Achilles&quot; and &quot;Ajax&quot; formed the other, splitting the fire of the German ship. They were only partially successful as the German ship concentrated her main armament of six guns on &quot;Exeter&quot;, and her secondary armament of eight guns on the light cruisers. Langsdorff opened fire on &quot;Exeter&quot; at 06:18 with high-explosive shells and she returned fire two minutes later at a range of . The German ship the British cruiser with her third salvo; shrapnel from the near misses killed the crew of the starboard torpedo tubes, started fires amidships and damaged both Supermarine Walrus seaplanes. After eight salvos from &quot;Exeter&quot;, &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; scored a direct hit on &#x27;B&#x27; turret that knocked it out of action and shrapnel from the hit killed all of the bridge personnel except three. Bell, wounded in the face, transferred to the aft conning position to continue the battle. His ship was hit twice more shortly afterwards, but her powerplant was not damaged and she remained seaworthy, although her aircraft had to be jettisoned.

At 06:30, Langsdorff switched his fire to the light cruisers, but only inflicted shrapnel damage on them before some of &quot;Exeter&quot;″s torpedoes forced him to turn away at 06:37 to evade them. Her second torpedo attack at 06:43 was also unsuccessful. In the meanwhile, Langsdorff had switched his main guns back to the heavy cruiser and scored several more hits. They knocked out &#x27;A&#x27; turret, started a fire amidships that damaged the ship&#x27;s fire-control and navigation circuits, and caused a seven-degree list with flooding. After &quot;Y&quot; turret had temporarily been disabled, Bell said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to ram the --------. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too&quot;. The turret was repaired and she remained in action until flooding disabled the machinery for &quot;Y&quot; turret at 07:30. At 11:07, Bell informed Harwood that &quot;Exeter&quot; had a single eight-inch and a four-inch gun available in local control, and that she could make . Harwood ordered Bell to head to the Falklands for repair.

The ship was hit by a total of seven 283 mm shells that killed 61 of her crew and wounded another 23. In return, the cruiser had hit &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; three times; one shell penetrated her main armour belt and narrowly missed detonating in one of her engine rooms, but the most important of these disabled her oil-purification equipment. Without it, the ship was unlikely to be able to reach Germany. Several days later, unable to be repaired and apparently confronted by powerful Royal Navy reinforcements (including HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot;), the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was scuttled by her captain in the harbour of Montevideo.

Although very heavily damaged, &quot;Exeter&quot; was still able to make good speed—18 knots—though four feet down by the bows, with a list of about eight degrees to starboard, and decks covered in fuel oil and water, making movement within the ship very difficult. She made for Port Stanley for emergency repairs which took until January 1940. There were rumours that she would remain in Stanley, becoming a rusting hulk, until the end of the war, but First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill wrote to the First Sea Lord and others &quot;We ought not readily to accept the non-repair during the war of &quot;Exeter&quot;. She should be strengthened and strutted internally as far as possible . . . and come home&quot;. She was repaired and modernised at HM Dockyard, Devonport between 14 February 1940 and 10 March 1941;

Captain W.N.T. Beckett was appointed to relieve Bell on 12 December 1940. Then, on 10 March 1941, the day that &quot;Exeter&quot; was due to be recommissioned, Beckett died at Saltash Hospital from complications following exploratory surgery to repair poison gas injuries that he had received earlier in his career. His replacement was Captain Oliver Gordon.

====To the Far East====
Upon returning to the fleet, &quot;Exeter&quot; primarily spent time on &#x27;working up&#x27; exercises, however she also conducted several patrols in northern waters, one on which she stopped in Iceland to refuel. On 22 May she departed from Britain (for the last time as it would turn out), escorting Convoy WS-8B to Aden (Yemen) via Freetown and Durban, South Africa (the beginning of which occurred at the very same time as the hunt for the . was taking place). &quot;Exeter&quot; henceforth became attached to the East Indies Squadron (later redesignated as the Far East Fleet).

&quot;Exeter&quot; then stayed on escort duty in the Indian Ocean (primarily off the coast of Africa) and the northern Arabian Sea (where she visited Bombay, India) until 13 October. On that day &quot;Exeter&quot; departed Aden for Colombo, British Ceylon) via Bombay, British India arriving on 24 October. &quot;Exeter&quot; then spent several days in a graving dock and after undocking (on the 29th) conducted exercises off Colombo and visited the Maldives.

Upon return to Trincomalee (Ceylon) from the Maldives on 14 November, &quot;Exeter&quot; then departed for Calcutta on the 16th to cover a small two-ship convoy that left Calcutta for Rangoon (Burma) on the 26th and 27th. After the successful completion of that duty she was then tasked to escort another ship from Calcutta to Rangoon on 6 December. However, during that convoy, on 8 December, &quot;Exeter&quot; was ordered to urgently proceed to Singapore to reinforce Force Z, as the Pacific War had just begun. &quot;Exeter&quot; arrived at Singapore during the afternoon of 10 December, too late to support and as they had both been sunk earlier that day, but some of the survivors from these two ships were treated in &quot;Exeter&quot;″s sick bay.

&quot;Exeter&quot; thus returned to Colombo the next day (11 December) and spent the next two months – until almost mid-February 1942 – escorting convoys (primarily from Bombay and Colombo) bound for Singapore – which fell to the Japanese on 15 February. During this time, in early 1942, &quot;Exeter&quot; was attached to the newly formed ABDA Command, (American-British-Dutch-Australian Command) which came into being in early January in Singapore, but soon shifted its headquarters to Java in the Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia).

====The Gaspar Strait sortie====
On 13 February Allied reconnaissance aircraft spotted Japanese invasion convoys north of Bangka Island and the new commander of ABDA naval forces, Vice Admiral Conrad Helfrich of the Royal Netherlands Navy, was ordered to assemble the Allied Striking Force of &quot;Exeter&quot; and three Dutch and one Australian light cruisers at Oosthaven on the morning of 14 February. Escorted by six American and three Dutch destroyers, the force departed that afternoon. The Dutch Rear Admiral Karel Doorman, commanding the force, took his ships through the Gaspar Strait and then northwest towards Bangka Island. While passing through the strait, the Dutch destroyer struck a rock in poor visibility and another Dutch destroyer was tasked to take off her crew. The Japanese spotted the Allied ships around 08:00 and repeatedly attacked them. The first was a group of seven Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers from the light carrier that attacked &quot;Exeter&quot; with bombs around 10:30. The blast from a near miss badly damaged her Walrus, but the ship was only damaged by shrapnel. They were followed shortly afterwards by a group of 23 Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; bombers from the Genzan Air Group that inflicted no damage as they dropped their bombs from high altitude. Another group of six B5Ns attacked without effect at 11:30.

The repeated aerial attacks persuaded Doorman that further progress was unwise in the face of Japanese aerial supremacy and he ordered his ships to reverse course and head for Tanjung Priok at 12:42. The attacks continued as 27 G3Ms of the Mihoro Air Group then bombed from high altitude. Seven more B5Ns attacked fruitlessly at 14:30; a half-dozen more followed an hour later. The final attack was made by 17 Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers of the Kanoya Air Group shortly before dark. The Japanese attacks were almost entirely ineffectual, with no ship reporting anything more than shrapnel damage. In return, allied anti-aircraft fire was moderately effective with most of the attacking bombers damaged by shrapnel. In addition, one G4M crashed while attempting to land, and another was badly damaged upon landing.

====First Battle of the Java Sea====

On 25 February, Helfrich ordered all available warships to join Doorman&#x27;s Eastern Striking Force at Surabaya. The &quot;Exeter&quot; and the Australian light cruiser , escorted by three British destroyers, , , and , set sail at once, leaving behind one Australian cruiser and two destroyers that were short of fuel. After they had arrived the following day, Doorman&#x27;s entire force of five cruisers and nine destroyers departed Surabaya at 18:30 to patrol off Eastern Java in hopes of intercepting the oncoming invasion convoy which had been spotted earlier that morning. The Japanese were further north than he anticipated and his ships found nothing. His own ships were located at 09:35 on the following morning, 27 February, and were continuously tracked by the Japanese. Doorman ordered a return to Surabaya at 10:30, and his ships were attacked by eight bombers from the Kanoya Air Group at 14:37. They claimed to have made two hits on the &quot;Jupiter&quot;, but actually they missed the British destroyer. Just as his leading ships were entering harbour, he received reports of enemy ships to the north and Doorman ordered his ships to turn about to intercept them.
Aware of Doorman&#x27;s movements, the Japanese commander, Rear Admiral Takeo Takagi, detached the convoy&#x27;s two escorting destroyer flotillas, each consisting of a light cruiser and seven destroyers, to intercept the Allied ships in conjunction with his own pair of heavy cruisers ( and ) which were escorted by a pair of destroyers. His heavy cruisers opened fire at long range at 15:47 with little effect. The light cruisers and destroyers closed to ranges between and began firing Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes beginning at 16:03. All of these torpedoes failed to damage their targets, although one torpedo hit &quot;Exeter&quot; and failed to detonate at 16:35. Three minutes later, &quot;Haguro&quot; changed the course of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the British ship&#x27;s starboard aft twin four-inch gun mount before detonating in the &#x27;B&#x27; or aft boiler room, knocking six of her boilers off-line and killing 14 of her crew. The ship out of line to avoid another torpedo and slowed, followed by all of the trailing cruisers. Moments later a torpedo fired from &quot;Haguro&quot; stuck the Dutch destroyer , breaking her in half and sinking her almost immediately. &quot;Perth&quot; laid a smoke screen to protect &quot;Exeter&quot; and the Allied ships sorted themselves into separate groups as they attempted to disengage. &quot;Exeter&quot; was escorted by one Dutch and all three British destroyers in one group and the other cruisers and the American destroyers formed the other group. The Japanese did not initially press their pursuit as they manoeuvered to use their torpedoes against the crippled &quot;Exeter&quot;, which could only make , and her escorts.
The Japanese began launching torpedoes beginning at 17:20 at ranges of , but they all missed. For some reason, two Japanese destroyers, and , continued to close before firing their torpedoes at and &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Electra&quot; pulled out of line to counter-attack. Engaging at close range as they closed, &quot;Electra&quot; damaged &quot;Asagumo&quot;, but was sunk by the Japanese ship at 17:46. Meanwhile, the &quot;Exeter&quot; continued south to Surabaya, escorted by &quot;Encounter&quot; and the Dutch destroyer . Doorman&#x27;s repeated, unsuccessful, and ultimately fatal attempts to reach the invasion convoy&#x27;s transports concentrated the Japanese on the task of protecting those ships and allowed the damaged British cruiser to reach harbour.

====Second Battle of the Java Sea====
The following day, after making temporary repairs and refuelling, the &quot;Exeter&quot;, escorted by &quot;Encounter&quot; and the American destroyer , was ordered to steam to Colombo, via the Sunda Strait. They departed on the evening of 28 February, but they were intercepted by the Japanese heavy cruisers &quot;Nachi&quot;, &quot;Haguro&quot;, , and , and by the destroyers , , , and on the morning of 1 March.

At about 0800, the British ships spotted two of the Japanese cruisers, one of which launched its spotting floatplanes. Two others were seen closing in, and both launched their aircraft before opening fire at about 09:30. The Allied ships laid smoke and turned away to the east with the Japanese to their north and south. &quot;Exeter&quot; was able to reach a speed of before the first hit on her detonated in her &#x27;A&#x27;, or forward, boiler room and catastrophically knocked out all power around 11:20. Now defenseless as no guns could train or traverse, and wanting to save as many lives as he could, and to avoid the ship&#x27;s capture by the Japanese forces, Captain Gordon ordered the ship to be scuttled. As a result, &quot;Exeter&quot; began listing to port, and that list was said to be at &quot;a considerable angle&quot; by the time the abandonment was completed. Sensing a kill, the Japanese destroyers closed in and fired torpedoes, two of which (out of a total of 18 fired by Japanese combatants) from the &quot;Inazuma&quot;, hit the ship – starboard amidships, and starboard just forward of A turret, as confirmed when the wreck was first discovered in 2007. As a result, &quot;Exeter&quot; rapidly righted herself, paused briefly, and then capsized to starboard. &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Pope&quot; were also lost; &quot;Encounter&quot; approximately fifteen minutes after &quot;Exeter&quot;, while &quot;Pope&quot; temporarily survived the initial melee, only to be sunk a couple of hours later. Japanese B5N Type-97s armed with one and four bombs assisted in the sinking of &quot;Pope&quot;, already crippled by bombing from seaplanes and land-based air, and closed in to make a level bombing attack. No direct hits were scored, but several more near-misses hastened the abandonment and scuttling of the vessel, and she was finished off by gunfire with the late arrival of the two IJN cruisers &quot;Ashigara&quot; and &quot;Myoko&quot;.

The Japanese rescued 652 men of the crew of &quot;Exeter&quot;, including her captain, who became prisoners of war.

==Wreck site==

The wreck was discovered and positively identified by a group of exploration divers specifically searching for &quot;Exeter&quot; aboard MV &quot;Empress&quot; on 21 February 2007. The wreck was found lying on its starboard side in Indonesian waters at a depth of about , north-west of Bawean Island – some from the estimated sinking position given by Captain Gordon after the war. In July 2008, performed a memorial service over the wreck of &quot;Exeter&quot;. Aboard, along with several British dignitaries and high ranking naval officers, were a BBC film crew and four of HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;″s veteran survivors, and one of the 2007 wreck discovery dive team representing the other three dive team members. Her wreck, a British war grave, had been destroyed by illegal salvagers by the time another expedition surveyed the site in 2016.

<text>John Cranch (1785–1816) was an English naturalist and explorer.

==Explorer==

John Cranch - &#x27;Jack&#x27; to his friends - took part in an expedition in 1816 under Captain James Hingston Tuckey to discover the source of the River Congo, and died there.

==Legacy==

His friend William Elford Leach named nineteen new species and one new genus after him in his description of the expedition. These include for example the marine isopod crustacean &quot;Cirolana cranchi&quot; which he named in 1818.

<text>The Opinel company has manufactured and marketed a line of eponymous wooden-handled knives since 1890 from its headquarters in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, Savoie, France where the family-run company also operates a museum dedicated to its knives. The company sells approximately 15 million knives annually. Opinel knives are made of both high carbon and stainless steel, the latter being Sandvik steel from Sweden.

Originally sold as a working man&#x27;s knife, an Opinel knife has become emblematic of French culture. Pablo Picasso is said to have used one of the company&#x27;s knives as a sculpting tool. In 1989, the Larousse dictionary cited &quot;Opinel&quot; as a registered trademark.

==History==
Joseph Opinel began making knives in 1890 in Savoie, France as a simple working man&#x27;s or &quot;peasant&#x27;s knife&quot;. It proved popular with the local farmers, herdsmen, and &quot;paysans-vignerons&quot; (peasant winemakers) of the area. In 1897, a series of twelve sizes, numbered 1 to 12, was developed. From 1901 to 1903, Joseph Opinel built his first factory in Pont de Gévoudaz and produced a machine for mass production of the knife&#x27;s wooden handles.

The company hired peddlers to sell the knives and opened a small shop near the Chambéry railway junction, where the knives became popular with PLM railroad workers, who in turn spread word of the brand throughout France. By 1909, Opinel had registered his first trademark for the Opinel knife, choosing the &quot;main couronnée&quot; (&quot;crowned hand&quot;) as his emblem. A few years later Opinel annual sales were in the hundreds of thousands, and by the start of World War II as many as 20 million knives had been sold.

The Opinel &quot;Virobloc&quot; or safety twistlock mechanism was invented by Marcel Opinel in 1955, increasing the safety and versatility of the knife by allowing the blade to be locked in the open position. In 2000, the Virobloc locking mechanism was improved to allow locking the blade in either the open or closed position.

In 1985 the Victoria and Albert Museum in London selected the Opinel knife as part of an exhibit celebrating the “100 most beautiful products in the world”, featuring the Opinel alongside the Porsche 911 sports car and the Rolex watch. The Opinel was also selected as one of the 999 classic designs in &quot;Phaidon Design Classics&quot;, and has been exhibited by the New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) as a design masterpiece.

==Description==

===Materials===
The traditional Opinel knife has a beechwood handle and a high carbon XC90 steel (&quot;acier au carbone&quot;) blade. Opinel also offers most of its models with a Sandvik 12C27M stainless steel (&quot;acier inox&quot;) blade. Custom Opinel models are available using luxurious or exotic handle woods such as oak, walnut, olive wood, bubinga (African rosewood), ebony and stained hornbeam, as well as other materials such as cowhorn.

The Opinel &quot;Slim Effilé&quot; series uses a tapered handle with a slender clip point blade made of Sandvik stainless steel, and the handle may be obtained in a variety of different materials, including bubinga, olive, ebony and cowhorn.
===Construction===


The current Opinel knife consists of a blade, wooden handle, stainless steel metal clamping band, stainless pivot pin (axle), and (except in the case of the smaller models) a stainless steel &quot;Virobloc&quot; locking collar, which locks the blade open or closed.

Smaller Opinel models (Nos. 2 through 5) have no locking blade mechanism, and use only the friction of the clamping band against the compressed handle and knife tang to hold the blade open, much the same as all Opinel knives sold before 1955. This simple design was sometimes known as a &quot;penny knife&quot; or &quot;peasant&#x27;s knife&quot;.

The locking collar (&quot;Virobloc&quot;) was patented in 1955 by Marcel Opinel, and is only found on the larger Opinel models (#6 and up). While simple, the locking mechanism is quite sturdy. Due to the way in which the locking collar tapers, the blade does not loosen over time and can be fixed firmly even once the mechanism is quite worn. In 2000 the locking collar was modified slightly to allow the blade to be locked in the closed as well as the open position. This feature prevents the blade from opening by accident when carried in a pocket.

Eighty percent of all Opinel knives use traditional beechwood for the handle. The company&#x27;s large demand for beechwood not infrequently results in a shortage of precut handle blanks, forcing the use of rectangular (bulk) sheets, which generate considerable wood waste. The excess wood waste and sawdust generated is subsequently recycled.

===Design and operation===
The curve of the original Opinel blade is a Yatagan (more commonly described as a drop point with a blade slightly angled downwards from the handle centerline), while the flared butt at the base of the wood handle is referred to as a fishtail. The modern No. 8 knife consists of 5 pieces (formerly 4); the handle, the blade, the pivot or axle, the metal collar and the locking ring or &quot;Virobloc&quot;. The blade is quite thin, only 1.68mm (.066 inches), which helps keep its weight to only 45g (1.6 ounces). Original Opinels and the smallest sizes today are still made of only 4 parts, lacking the simple Virobloc locking mechanism. The locking ring can easily be removed with simple tools for use in countries where locking knives are prohibited; some sources claim that opening the blade with the ring in the locked position causes the ring to pop off; it can be replaced easily later if desired. The No. 8 &quot;Couteau du Jardin&quot; or Garden Knife uses a folding drop-point blade with a slim, tapered wood handle, while the Opinel No. 8 and No. 10 Pruning Knives, designed for pruning shrubs and vines, feature a large folding hawkbill blade fitted to an elegantly curved wooden handle. The Opinel &quot;Slim Effile&quot; series use a thinner-profile stainless steel blade fitted to a tapered wood handle. Available in several sizes and handle materials, the &quot;Slim Effile&quot; knives are intended for tasks such as cleaning and fileting fish and thinly slicing meats and cheeses.
The traditional Opinel is designed to be opened with two hands, and a nail nick is provided on the blade. It is possible to adjust the fitting of the safety locking collar if it is too tight or too loose. Those practiced in the art of &quot;coup du savoyard&quot; grip the metal collar between index finger and thumb and tap the heel of the handle firmly on a hard surface, as if using it as a drumstick; the blade should open slightly from the handle, allowing it to be rotated into position with the thumb.

===Logo===
The &quot;main couronnée&quot; (&quot;crowned hand&quot;) device was already present on the blade of very early models. Later the words OPINEL and FRANCE were added, as well as INOX (&quot;stainless&quot;, from &quot;INOXidable&quot;, meaning &quot;non-oxidizable) in the case of stainless steel blades.

The image of the hand comes from the arms of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, and represents the relics of John the Baptist, three of whose finger-bones were supposedly brought back from Alexandria by Saint Tecla in the 5th century. The crown comes from the arms of Savoy, the larger region containing Savoie.

===Sizes and variations===

Opinel knives are currently offered in eleven numbered sizes: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. The No. 1 Opinel was discontinued in 1932. With its tiny 2 cm (0.787-inch) blade and boxwood handle, it was meant to be attached to a key fob or watch chain and used as a tobacco pipe cleaner or nail cleaner, but was judged to be too small. The No. 11 Opinel was discontinued in 1935, its size being considered too similar to Opinels Nos. 10 and 12.

With its 8.5 cm blade, the No. 8 Opinel is perhaps the most widely used size, though Nos. 4, 6, and 10 are consistent sellers. There is a considerable difference in size between No. 12 (12 cm blade) and the recently-added novelty No. 13, &quot;Le Géant&quot; (&quot;the Giant&quot;) with its 22 cm blade. There is now a No. 7 round-ended knife without the sharp point, intended for children and others as &quot;My first Opinel&quot;.

A variety of different Opinels have been offered over the years. A few are sold more for their novelty value than for practical purposes, such as &quot;Le Géant&quot;. Besides the &quot;Slim Effile&quot; series and the &quot;Couteau du Jardin&quot;, Opinel also offers a hawkbill-bladed pruning knife designed for use in the garden or vineyard, and a large folding wood saw with locking blade using the same &quot;Virobloc&quot; mechanism as found on large Opinel knives. For the kitchen, the company sells vegetable peelers, chefs knives, paring knives, knives with corkscrews (&quot;couteau tire-bouchon&quot;), and prep knives for the kitchen, including a mushroom knife (&quot;couteau à champignon&quot;), with an integral boar&#x27;s hair cleaning brush. In 2014, Opinel again released new varieties of knives for cooking.

<text>The Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity Friendly Society Limited, also called the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows; trading as &quot;The Oddfellows&quot;, is a fraternal order founded in Manchester in 1810.

Some of its lodges claim histories dating back to the 18th century. These various organisations were set up to protect and care for their members and communities at a time when there was no welfare state or National Health Service. The aim was and still is to provide help to members and communities when they need it. The friendly societies are non-profit mutual organisations owned by their members. All income is passed back to the members in the form of services and benefits.

The Oddfellows had spread to America in the late 18th century, and several unofficial lodges existed in New York City; but American Odd Fellowship is regarded as being founded in Baltimore in 1819, by Thomas Wildey, and the following year affiliated with the Manchester Unity. In 1843, the Oddfellows in America declared their independence from the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows and became a self-governing Order – the Independent Order of Odd Fellows – which established lodges across the world (and continues to this day), although inter-fraternally recognised.

The Oddfellows are also fundraisers for local and national charities; lodges raise money for local causes, and the society as a whole raise significant amounts for charities.

As a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, (when the Protestant William of Orange replaced the Catholic King James II), in the mid-18th century the Oddfellows split into The Order of Patriotic Oddfellows (based in the south of England and supporting William) and The Ancient Order of Oddfellows (based in the north and favouring the Stuarts).

Subsequent to the failure of Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s uprising, in 1798 the two Orders formed a partial amalgamation as the Grand United Order of Oddfellows. These days they are more commonly known as the Grand United Order of Oddfellows Friendly Society (GUOOFS).

=== Foundation ===

In 1810, members of the Oddfellows in Manchester area became dissatisfied with the way the Grand United Order was being run and formed the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity. The order continues in operation using the trading name &quot;The Oddfellows&quot;.

According to Manchester Unity literature, &quot;With their improved organisation and rules, they encouraged many other lodges across the country to leave the old Grand United Order and join the Independent Order under the &#x27;Manchester Compliance&#x27;.

=== Subsequent breakaways ===
Subsequent breakaways from the parent Grand United Order and from the new Manchester Unity Order resulted in the formation of further Orders of Odd Fellows. In the case of the parent Order, various lodges seceded in 1832 to found the Ancient &amp; Noble (Bolton Unity), which subsequently dissolved in 1962, and in the case of the new Order, the Nottingham Odd Fellows.

The Grand United Order of Oddfellows (Sheffield Unity) was formed in an early breakaway from the Manchester Unity. The Ancient Noble Order of Oddfellows (Bolton Unity) was formed from the Sheffield Unity in 1832. The Nottingham Ancient Imperial Order of Oddfellows was formed from the Sheffield Unity in 1812. The Improved Independent Order of Oddfellows (London Unity) was formed from the Manchester Unity around 1820. The British United Order of Oddfellows was formed from the Imperial Nottingham Order in 1867.

The Albion Order of Oddfellows was formed from the Manchester Unity in 1831. Several other secessions then occurred to form the Nottingham Independent Order, the Derby Midland Order, the Ilkison Unity and the Norfolk and Norwich Unity. The Kent Unity was formed in 1805; its first Lodge, however, was not formed until 1861.

The Kingston Unity of Oddfellows was formed from the Manchester Unity in 1840, and the National Independent Order was formed from the Manchester Unity in 1846. There was an East Anglia Unity; a few items of their regalia and jewels are in the museum at Freemasons&#x27; Hall in London.

The Wolverhampton Unity of Oddfellows ceased to exist in 1876 when it merged with the Ancient Order of Shepherds.

====American separation====
The Oddfellows had spread to America in the late 18th century, and several unofficial lodges existed in New York City; but American Odd Fellowship is regarded as being founded in Baltimore in 1819, by Thomas Wildey, and the following year affiliated with the Manchester Unity.

In Britain in 1834, the Tolpuddle Martyrs were unexpectedly convicted and transported for &quot;membership of an illegal friendly society&quot;. The Oddfellows &quot;board of directors&quot; hastily modified the &quot;constitution&quot; to evade a similar fate. Members of the Oddfellows in the United States were not pleased to see the ancient rituals changed without their agreement, particularly to satisfy a British Government against which they had fought a war of independence. As a result, in 1834 the Oddfellows in America declared their independence from the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows and became a self-governing Order – the Independent Order of Odd Fellows – which established lodges across the world (and continues to this day). Lodges have been set up in Canada, Germany, Iceland, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands and many other European countries, and in Asia.

===International spread of Oddfellowship===

The concept of the Oddfellows was taken abroad as members emigrated to the far-flung corners of the Commonwealth and to the New World. Today, the Oddfellows can be found in many countries across the world, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies.

A revival of the procedures followed by the oldest ascertained Oddfellows&#x27; unit, the &quot;Loyal Aristarcus Lodge&quot; in London (1730–40), was started in 2010 by a group of Italian Oddfellows, led by Masonic author Michele Moramarco.

==== Australian Lodge (1849–1993)====
The first meeting of the Australia Felix Lodge of Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows (MUIOOF) was held on 7 December 1840 in Melbourne. Its founder, Thomas Strode, printer and proprietor of Melbourne&#x27;s first legally recognised newspaper the Port Phillip Gazette, advertised in his paper for past members of the Oddfellows Society of Manchester to meet with him to discuss forming a Melbourne lodge. Along with Strode, Manchester Unity&#x27;s founders in Australia included Dr Augustus Greeves, a surgeon who later became the Mayor of Melbourne; John Marzagor, a carpenter; John Shepperd, a painter and glazier; and William Johnson Sugden, a sheriff&#x27;s bailiff who four years later became the colony&#x27;s chief constable.

On 1 January 1932, work began on the Manchester Unity Building in Melbourne. By that time the full effects of the Great Depression were being felt, but the Directors decided to press ahead because, being a benevolent society, they felt it was important to show confidence that the economy would improve, and also to provide a source of employment.

In 1993, Manchester Unity (Victoria) merged with the Australian Natives&#x27; Association to form Australian Unity Friendly Society Limited, now known as Australian Unity Limited.

== Organisation ==

=== Oddfellows lodge ===
The elimination of the Trade Guilds removed an important form of social and financial support from ordinary working people. In major cities like London, some Guilds (e.g. the &quot;Free Masons&quot; and the &quot;Odd Fellows&quot;) survived by adapting their roles to a social support function. Both of these had their base in London, but had established branches (called &#x27;Lodges&#x27;) across the country.

The earliest surviving record of an Oddfellows Lodge is the manuscript of the rules, dated 1748, of the &quot;Loyal Aristarcus Lodge No. 9&quot; which met in inns in the Southwark, Hatton Garden and Smithfield areas of London. Many pubs in Britain are named &#x27;The Oddfellows&#x27; or &#x27;Oddfellows Arms&#x27;, probably because they were once meeting places of Lodges.

In the French Revolution, the radicals who seized control were afraid of the Oddfellows, Freemasons and the like. Membership became a criminal offence in France, and such organisations were driven underground and forced to use codes, passwords, special handshakes and similar mechanisms. Fear of revolution was not the sole reason for persecution; Friendly Societies like the Oddfellows were the predecessors of modern-day trade unions and could facilitate effective local strike action by levying all of their members for additional contributions for their benevolent funds, out of which payments could be made to the families of members who were on strike.

The Oddfellows subsequently introduced a number of novel benefits for members. These included the Travel Warrant, which allowed members seeking work to stay overnight in an Oddfellows Hall, anywhere in the country, free of charge. The Oddfellows also introduced standard protection policies, sometimes called &quot;tables&quot; because each type of policy had its own numbered table of premium rates. People could subscribe to protect themselves financially. In the United Kingdom, until 1948, payment was required to see a doctor or to go into hospital. Many people therefore joined friendly societies like the Oddfellows to obtain financial protection to meet these costs.

== Activities ==
===Financial services===

During the 20th century, the welfare state and the National Health Service took over the significant part of the role of friendly societies, and since 1948 the role of the Oddfellows has evolved in other directions, with a continuing focus on social involvement, care and support, as well as financial benefits. In the second half of the 20th century, the Oddfellows moved into financial products. Thus, in 1991, Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity founded the Manchester Unity Credit Union Limited, a savings and loans co-operative established for members of the order.

==Legitimacy and controversy==

=== State authorities ===
The Oddfellows continued to be viewed with suspicion by &quot;the establishment&quot;. At various times, right up to 1850, some aspects of the Orders&#x27; practices were declared illegal. However, by 1850, the Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity Friendly Society had become the largest and richest friendly society in Britain. This growth was spurred by the growth caused by the Industrial Revolution, the lack of Trade Unions, and the lack of personal or public insurance; only by joining mutual friendly societies like the Oddfellows could ordinary people protect themselves and their families against illness, injury or death.

In 1911, when Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government was setting up the National Insurance Act in Britain, the Oddfellows protected so many people that the government used the Oddfellows&#x27; actuarial tables to work out the level of contribution and payment required. At that time the Oddfellows was the largest friendly society in the world.

==Notable members==
Throughout history some members of the fraternities have made no secret of their involvement, while others have not made their membership public. In some cases, membership can only be proven by searching through a fraternity&#x27;s records. Such records are most often kept at the individual lodge level, and may be lost due to fire, flood, deterioration, or simple carelessness. Grand lodge governance may have shifted or reorganised, resulting in further loss of records on the member or the name, number, location or even existence of the lodge in question. In areas of the world where Odd Fellows have been suppressed by governments, records of entire grand lodges have been destroyed. Because of this, membership can sometimes be difficult to verify.

<text>Traian Popovici (October 17, 1892 – June 4, 1946) was a Romanian lawyer and mayor of Cernăuți during World War II, known for saving 20,000 Jews of Bukovina from deportation.

== Life ==
Popovici was born in Rușii Mănăstioarei village of the Duchy of Bukovina in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the son of Andrei Popovich of Udești and grandson of Ioan Popovich, a famous priest, who, in 1777, refused to take the oath to the Austrian Empire. His uncle was (1873–1950), who became a minister for Bucovina under the government led by General Alexandru Averescu.

He studied at the Suceava high school (1903–1911), then enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University of Chernowitz, which he graduated at the end of World War I. He was a former president of &quot;Societatea Academică Junimea&quot;. In 1908, while a high school student, he crossed from Austria-Hungary into Romania illegally, in order to see Nicolae Iorga who was visiting the town of Burdujeni. When World War I started, he went to Romania and enlisted in the Romanian Army, fighting until the end of the war. After World War I, he settled briefly in Chișinău, where he was secretary at &quot;Our House&quot; organization that dealt with land reform.

In the interwar period, he worked as a lawyer in the city of Cernăuți. After the Soviet occupation of Northern Bukovina in June 1940, he took refuge in Bucharest, where he continued to work as a lawyer.

==Mayor of Cernăuți==
In June 1941, Romania entered World War II on the side of the Axis and soon after re-established control over Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. Military dictator Ion Antonescu requested him to become mayor of Cernăuți, but Popovici initially refused, unwilling to serve a fascist government. He changed his mind, however, based on advice from his friends. A few days after acceptance, in early August 1941, he was ordered by , the Governor-General of Bukovina, to create a ghetto for the Jews of Cernăuți, but Popovici refused to accept that part of the city&#x27;s population could be confined behind barbed wire fences.

On August 30, 1941, Rioșanu died after an unsuccessful surgery, and he was succeeded as governor by General Corneliu Calotescu. On October 10, Calotescu announced his decision that all the Jews of Cernăuți must be deported to Transnistria. After a long debate, Calotescu allowed Popovici to nominate 200 Jews who were to be exempted from deportation. Unsatisfied with the modest concession, Popovici tried reaching Antonescu himself, this time arguing that Jews were of capital importance to Cernăuți&#x27;s economy and requested a postponement until replacements could be found. As a result, he was allowed to expand the list, which covered 20,000 Jews in its final version.
Popovici died in 1946 in the village of Colacu (part of Fundu Moldovei commune, in Suceava County), and was buried in the churchyard of the village, next to the .

Due to Popovici&#x27;s defense of Jews, his political adversaries nicknamed him &quot;jidovitul&quot; (&quot;the turned-Jewish&quot;).

==Legacy==

Popovici is honored by Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem memorial as one of the &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;, an honour given to non-Jews who behaved with heroism in trying to save Jews from the genocide of the Holocaust.

<text>Evan David Taubenfeld (born June 27, 1983) is an American singer and musician, best known for being Avril Lavigne&#x27;s lead guitarist, music director and frequent collaborator. Taubenfeld&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Welcome to the Blacklist Club&quot;, was released in 2010.

== Early life ==
Taubenfeld was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Mark and Ami Taubenfeld, who ran a catering business. He has two siblings, a younger brother named Drew (b. 1984), who is a multi-instrumentalist and musical director for Kacey Musgraves, and a younger sister, Annie (b. 1990). He was raised Jewish. Taubenfeld graduated from McDonogh School in 2001.

Taubenfeld had an early interest in music and took an interest at the piano at home as a toddler. He received a small drum kit as a young child, continuing on a full-size drum kit several years later. While in seventh grade, he joined the band The Suburbanites on drums. At the age of 14, he taught himself guitar by learning to play &quot;Come As You Are&quot; by Nirvana. After 3 years, he founded Spinfire with his friend Matt Halpern in which he sang and played guitar. They performed at festivals and shows in the Baltimore area, and wrote and produced songs such as &quot;Feeling Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Lettin&#x27; It Be&quot;, and &quot;Waiting.&quot;

== Career ==
=== With Avril Lavigne (2003-2011) ===
Taubenfeld considered studying at Berklee College of Music, but chose to market his band with major labels instead. When his band members chose to go to college instead, Taubenfeld recorded a demo of his own music, among others sending it to Arista Records A&amp;R vice president Josh Sarubin, who he made his acquaintance with during his time in Spinfire. Taubenfeld received a phone call from Sarubin, who invited him to audition in New York City for the band of a new talent he just signed, a young Canadian named Avril Lavigne. He joined this band in 2002 when her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; had already been recorded. For Lavigne&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, Taubenfeld contributed to the music and was credited for the music on &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;, &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, and &quot;Freak Out&quot;, the latter of which he shared the credits with drummer Matt Brann. In addition to being her lead guitarist, he took up music directing and became a close friend of Lavigne. He left the band in September 2004, when he was signed as a staff writer with EMI Music Publishing, after which he got his own recording contract with Sire/Warner Bros. Records in October 2004.

Taubenfeld would continue to collaborate with Lavigne for several more years. He co-wrote four songs with Lavigne on her 2007 album &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot;, including the hit single &quot;Hot&quot;. Additionally, he appeared in the music video for Lavigne&#x27;s &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, which also featured on &quot;The Best Damn Thing&quot;, appearing alongside Lavigne and her brother, Matt, in her backing band. In 2010, he performed &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Girlfriend&quot; acoustically with Lavigne and her band member, Jim McGorman. On &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot; from 2011, he co-wrote three songs, performed vocals on the bridge of &quot;Push&quot;, along with playing in several instruments, and doing engineering and producing work on the album. He subsequently was the opening act for Lavigne on the North American Leg her 2011 Black Star World Tour.

=== Solo career and other projects (2003-present) ===
In 2003, while still playing in Lavigne&#x27;s band, Taubenfeld formed the band Ditch Ruxton, with whom he performed one show. The group disbanded within the year.

In 2008, Taubenfeld produced two tracks for rapper Tyga&#x27;s debut album &quot;No Introduction&quot;, &quot;Press 7&quot; and another song &quot;First Timers&quot; which he sang the Chorus on. He also produced for The Pack and Oreskaband.

For his solo material, Taubenfeld set up his own band, named The Black List Club. His first solo single, &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, was released in March 2009. It was co-written with among others indie pop artists Adam Richman and Bleu. To promote the single, Taubenfeld toured with Metro Station, Mitchel Musso and Mayday Parade in July 2009. Taubenfeld&#x27;s Christmas single, &quot;Merry Swiftmas (Even Though I Celebrate Chanukah)&quot; debuted in late 2009 at #59 on the Hot Country Songs chart, in which he besung Taylor Swift and Christmas years before Swift trademarked the term &quot;Swiftmas&quot;. It would take until May 2010 until his album &quot;Welcome to the Blacklist Club&quot; was released. He has since continued to record and release songs, but not in album format.

Taubenfeld was the executive musical director for the short-lived MTV show &quot;Kaya&quot;, a scripted drama about a girl who gets signed to a major label with her band. He among others co-wrote, recorded and produced the soundtrack for the series. He also had a role on the Web series &quot;Private&quot; as Blake Pearson, and produced for the MTV series &quot;Pageant Place&quot;.

In 2012, Taubenfeld co-wrote the song &quot;Shine&quot; for The Used album &quot;Vulnerable&quot;. That same year, he produced for the Japanese band Stereopony, and collaborated with them on the song &quot;Just Rock With Me&quot;, for which the collective was dubbed &quot;Evanpony&quot; in public releases of the song.

Taubenfeld presently runs Crush Music Publishing, a music publishing joint venture between Songs Publishing and Crush Management.

<doc id="1194287" wikidata="Q1746263" url="?curid=1194287" title="Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids">
<text>The Order of Bards, Ovates &amp; Druids or OBOD is a Neo-Druidic order based in England, but based in part on the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards. It has grown to become a dynamic druid organisation, with members in all parts of the world.

The concept of the three roles of bards, ovates and druids originates from the writings of the ancient Greek historian and geographer Strabo, who in his &quot;Geographica&quot;, written in the 20s CE, stated that amongst the Gauls, there were three types of honoured figures: the poets and singers known as &quot;bardoi&quot;, the diviners and specialists in the natural world known as &quot;o&#x27;vateis&quot;, and those who studied &quot;moral philosophy&quot;, the &quot;druidai&quot;. Nonetheless, Strabo&#x27;s accuracy has been called into question, as he was not actually well acquainted with Gaul and was likely relying on earlier sources whose accuracy is also disputed.

==Leadership==
OBOD was founded in 1964 as a split from the Ancient Druid Order with Ross Nichols as its leader.

In 1988, more than a decade after Nichols&#x27; passing, and after study in the Order and helping to further its reaches, Philip Carr-Gomm was asked to lead the Order. Other notable members also hold somewhat senior positions in the order, often with the title of &quot;Honorary Bard&quot;. A good example of this is Damh the Bard, who is involved in the UK groves and running the podcast. Damh runs his own website where he has just completed work on a bardic version of Branch Three of the Mabinogion, makes regular house concerts on YouTube, and contributes regularly to another podcast, The Celtic Myth Podshow, which has also dramatised the Mabinogion tales.

Eimear Burke was installed as the new Chief of the Order in June 2020. Burke, who had served as leader of the Kilkenny Druid Grove, was named to the position two years prior. Due to the social lockdown caused by the coronavirus, her installation proceeded without the special gathering of OBOD members that had originally been planned. The induction ceremony was broadcast on the Order&#x27;s YouTube channel, with select leaders present, including the Scribe, Stephanie Carr-Gomm, and the Pendragon, Dave Smith. Burke has been a frequent contributor to OBOD&#x27;s Tea With A Druid series as well as running a YouTube channel for the Kilkenny Grove. Immediately prior to Burke&#x27;s installation, Philip Carr-Gomm gave a short farewell speech featuring a musical contribution in the form of bagpipe playing from his friend and trusted Order member, Chris Park.

==Dissemination==
The OBOD teachings are available principally in the form of a distance-learning course available online or by mail. There is a network of mentors, many using email, to support the students’ progress through the grades of Bard, Ovate and Druid. Members meet at camps, at workshops and assemblies in various parts of the world, and a network of groves and seedgroups also exists. There are a number of internet forums, a private members’ website in addition to OBOD&#x27;s public-access site, and a monthly journal &quot;Touchstone&quot;. Quarterly journals are also published by members in various parts of the world: &quot;Dryade&quot; for Dutch-speaking members, &quot;Menhir&quot; in French, &quot;Druidenstein&quot; in German, &quot;Il Calderone&quot; in Italian, &quot;Ophiusa&quot; in Portuguese and two regional English-language magazines—&quot;SerpentStar&quot; in Australasia and &quot;Druid&quot; in North America.

==Teachings==

The teachings of the Order could be seen as typical of neo-druidism today, in that it teaches its followers the belief of the sanctity of nature and a belief in the Otherworld. Although its teaching draws upon Celtic sources, it also incorporates ideas from modern psychology and the Human Potential movement, and from perennialist thinkers such as Aldous Huxley and Frithjof Schuon.

Many members of the Order prefer to learn at home, solitary, as opposed to recorded Druids of early pre-Christian Britain that would have congregated to share wisdom or meet for occasion. Members are sent course information and materials, and may be assigned a tutor if they wish to have someone to communicate with.

Individual Druids and the groups that they practice with are allowed to decide their own pantheons. Many members follow Celtic pantheons, usually relating to the four pre-Christian Celtic nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, as well as related beliefs and practices, such as ancestral worship, naturism, polytheism and Spiritualism. The Order&#x27;s official teachings, however, are presented ecumenically as a spiritual philosophy compatible with many religious beliefs, and other members hold monotheistic, pantheistic, atheistic, and other views. Many OBOD Druids identify as Pagan, but others identify as Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, or many other religions, while some follow Druidry as their primary or only spiritual path.

The Order possesses an online presence regarding Druidic teachings. OBOD has an online library which carries articles on different aspects of Druidry and topics which would be of interest to Druids, including serious scholarly work such as The Mount Haemus Lectures. There is a regular podcast which is advertised through the Order&#x27;s Facebook page called Druidcast which features music, lectures and an introduction by musician Dave Smith aka. Damh the Bard, this has now reached episode 158 after many years of broadcasting. Subjects cover not just Druidry but a wide spectrum of paganism as well as bardic performances. The Order also broadcasts a weekly podcast, Tea With A Druid, which has currently reached 126 episodes. Each episode consists of a story followed by a brief meditation, led by a different member of OBOD each week.

<text>Stephen Derek Heighway (born 25 November 1947) is an Irish former footballer who played as a winger. He was part of the successful Liverpool team of the 1970s. Following his eleven-year spell at the club, he was ranked 23rd in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop poll.

Heighway became academy director at Liverpool in a period when the club welcomed players including Steven Gerrard, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jamie Carragher. He retired in 2007 but later rejoined the Liverpool Academy in a consulting role, which he held until retiring again in 2022.

==Life and playing career==
Heighway was born in Dublin, Ireland. His early education took place in Sheffield where he attended Ecclesall Junior School (until 1959), followed by High Storrs School and latterly Moseley Hall Grammar School for Boys in Cheadle, near Stockport.

Heighway&#x27;s early promise as a winger was not spotted by professionals. Instead, he concentrated on his studies in economics and politics at the University of Warwick in Coventry (where he started in 1966) achieving a 2:1.

In 1970, Heighway was studying for his final exams and playing for Skelmersdale United when he was spotted by Liverpool&#x27;s scouting system. With manager Bill Shankly keen to rebuild his ageing, underachieving team of the 1960s, Heighway was signed up swiftly in May of that year. It was due to Heighway&#x27;s academic achievements that he got his nickname &#x27;Big Bamber&#x27;, while teammate and fellow university graduate Brian Hall was dubbed &#x27;Little Bamber&#x27; – both after the television programme University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne.

A strong and fast left winger with two good feet, Heighway settled into top flight football after making his debut on September 22, 1970, in a League Cup 2nd round replay at Anfield against Mansfield Town (3-2). Heighway opened his goalscoring account in the 51st minute of a 2–0 home league win over Burnley on October 1, 1970.

A month later, he scored against Merseyside rivals Everton in a hard-fought 3–2 win, after his team had found themselves 2–0 down not long into the second half. He stayed in the side for the rest of the season as Liverpool&#x27;s new charges finished the league campaign strongly and also defeated Everton in the semi-finals of the FA Cup to reach the final at Wembley.

Their opponents were Arsenal, who were after a coveted &quot;double&quot; having won the League championship. Heighway played confidently in a match that was goalless after 90 minutes and therefore needed a period of extra-time. Just two minutes into the added half-hour, Heighway received the ball wide on his left flank from substitute Peter Thompson and started a run towards the Arsenal penalty area, with Gunners full back Pat Rice tracking his run but unwilling to put in a tackle. With a swift turn outside Heighway gained a yard on Rice and hit a low drive into the net past Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson, who had committed the cardinal goalkeeping sin of coming out too far from his near post to anticipate a cross, thereby leaving a gap that Heighway exploited. Sadly for Heighway and Liverpool, their opponents scored two goals in response.

Heighway settled into the Liverpool team for the next decade, winning the first of four League titles in 1973, along with the UEFA Cup. He returned to Wembley for another FA Cup final a year later as Liverpool faced Newcastle United. Heighway scored again with 16 minutes of the game remaining to make the score 2–0, latching on to a flick from John Toshack after a long clearance from goalkeeper Ray Clemence to slot a right-footed shot into the far corner. The game ended 3–0.

By now, Heighway was a regular for the Republic of Ireland making his debut on 23 September 1970 against Poland. He remained so for the whole of the 1970s, winning a total of 34 caps but never managing to score. He did have a goal disallowed in a qualifier for the 1978 World Cup against Bulgaria in Sofia. On the domestic front, Heighway attained another League and UEFA Cup double with Liverpool in 1976 and then formed part of the side which came so close to the &quot;treble&quot; of League, FA Cup and European Cup.

Liverpool won the League by a single point and again defeated rivals Everton in the semi-final to reach the FA Cup final, this time to face bitter rivals Manchester United at Wembley. Liverpool lost 2–1 and the &quot;treble&quot; dream was dead.

Heighway scored his first goal of the 1977 European Cup in a 5–0 first round second leg win over Crusaders. He then scored in a 3–0 second round win against Trabzonspor and in the 3–1 semi-final first leg win over Zurich. Liverpool beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 to win their first European Cup, with Heighway setting up both outfield goals for Terry McDermott, a defence-splitting pass, and Tommy Smith, a corner.

In 1978, Heighway was on the bench as Liverpool retained the European Cup with a 1–0 victory over FC Bruges at Wembley, coming on as a substitute for Jimmy Case. The following year he was again in the side frequently as Liverpool won another League title, but from 1980 onwards his opportunities in the side diminished.

Heighway stayed for two more seasons, appearing only occasionally in the team and missing out on two more League title medals, another European Cup triumph and a first League Cup medal, which was successfully defended a year later. He left Anfield in 1982 after 444 matches and 76 goals.

Heighway then prolonged his career with a move to the U.S., joining Minnesota Kicks for the 1981 season. He played 26 games, scoring four goals. He then joined the coaching staff of Umbro, which led to a position with the Clearwater Chargers where he pioneered the role of director of coaching in the United States. In 1989 he was asked to rejoin Liverpool to run their youth academy, bringing promising youngsters up through the system until they were ready for the professional game. Among Heighway&#x27;s successes were Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler, Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Dominic Matteo, David Thompson and Michael Owen.

On 4 September 2006, a poll on Liverpool&#x27;s official web site named Heighway 23rd out of 100 Players Who Shook The Kop.

Heighway announced his retirement from Liverpool on 26 April 2007, immediately after the side he managed won the FA Youth Cup for the second year running. He commented: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the future holds just yet, we&#x27;ll have to wait and see.&quot;

Heighway returned to working at Liverpool&#x27;s Academy part-time in 2015, at the request of Academy Director Alex Inglethorpe, before taking up a full-time consultancy role later that year. After seven years in this position, he retired for a second time in December 2022.

Heighway also features in the popular Liverpool chant, Fields of Anfield Road, which is frequently sung by Liverpool fans during matches.

<text>The Marvel No-Prize is a fake or satirical award given out by Marvel Comics to readers. Originally for those who spotted continuity errors in the comics, the current &quot;No-Prizes&quot; are given out for charitable works or other types of &quot;meritorious service to the cause of Marveldom&quot;. As the No-Prize evolved, it was distinguished by its role in explaining away potential continuity errors. Initially awarded simply for identifying such errors, a No-Prize was later given only when a reader successfully explained why the continuity error was not an error at all.

== History ==
=== Predecessors and antecedents of the No-Prize ===
The No-Prize was inspired by the policies of many other comic book publishers of the early 1960s—namely, that if a fan found a continuity error in a comic and wrote a letter to the publisher of the comic, the fan would receive a prize of cash, free comics, or even original artwork.

In a similar vein, in 1962, Marvel Comics writer/editor Stan Lee promised, in the letters page of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #4, that he would send five dollars to a reader who would write in with the best explanation for a continuity error from an earlier issue. When the Marvel offices were inundated with suggestions, Lee awarded the $5 to the first letter received, and printed the names of all the other correspondents who had sent in good answers.

=== The first No-Prizes ===
This sort of interaction with the readers continued, with contests and polls being run on the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; letters page for the next few years. In the letters page for issue #22, featuring a contest for which reader had the largest comics collection, Lee announced that &quot;no prizes&quot; would be given (&quot;because we&#x27;re cheapskates!&quot;). The winner of the contest was announced in issue #25, where it was officially dubbed a &quot;No-Prize.&quot; 

In &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #26, Lee ran a contest asking readers to send in their definition of what &quot;the Marvel Age of Comics&quot; really meant. As part of the letter, Lee wrote &quot;there will be no prizes, and therefore, no losers&quot;. Originally, the &quot;prize&quot; was simply Lee publishing the letter and informing the letter-writer that they had won a No-Prize, which was actually nothing.

Other No-Prize contests asked readers questions and rewarded the most creative responses. One example asked readers for proof of whether the Sub-Mariner was a mutant or not (it has since been firmly established in continuity that the Sub-Mariner is a mutant). Winners had their letters printed, along with Lee congratulating them on winning a No-Prize.

=== For &quot;meritorious service&quot; ===
The No-Prize had been intended as a reminder to Marvel readers to &quot;lighten up&quot; and read comics for pleasure; to not write in for prizes, but instead for the thrill of being recognized for their efforts. Letters soon multiplied, however, as fans wrote in looking for errors in every comic they could, and suddenly the non-existent prize was in high demand. In response, Lee took on a new approach. Since other comic companies had given out prizes for pointing out oversights and continuity errors in their books, Lee began awarding No-Prizes in such situations only &quot;to the fan who could explain a seemingly unexplainable situation.&quot; The reader who inspired this version of the No-Prize was a teenage George R. R. Martin, later a successful novelist.

The No-Prize soon evolved into a reward to those who performed &quot;meritorious service to the cause of Marveldom&quot;: readers who first spotted a mistake, or came up with a plausible way to explain a mistake others spotted, or made some great suggestion or performed a service for Marvel in general.

=== No-Prize distribution ===

As time went by, some recipients of the &quot;award&quot; began to write Lee and ask why they had not received an actual prize. In response, in 1967 Lee began mailing No-Prize-winners pre-printed empty envelopes that said &quot;Congratulations, this envelope contains a genuine Marvel Comics No-Prize which you have just won!&quot; However, some uncomprehending fans wrote back asking where their prize was, even going so far as to suggest their prize had fallen out of the envelope.

===Confusion and decline===
After Lee stepped down as Marvel editor-in-chief in 1972 (becoming Marvel&#x27;s publisher), Marvel&#x27;s various editors, who were left in charge of dispensing No-Prizes, developed differing policies toward awarding them. By 1986, these policies ranged from Ralph Macchio&#x27;s practice of giving them away to anyone who wrote a letter asking for one to Mike Higgins&#x27; policy of not awarding them at all. As reported in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #213 (Dec. 1986), these were the various editors&#x27; policies:

* Ann Nocenti (&quot;X-Men&quot;): &quot;The spirit of the No-Prize is not just to complain and nitpick but to offer an exciting solution. Do that and you will get one from me.&quot;
* Carl Potts (&quot;Alpha Flight&quot; and &quot;Power Pack)&quot;: &quot;If someone points out a major story problem I&#x27;m not aware of and solves it to my satisfaction, I&#x27;ll award a No-Prize. I give away very few.&quot;
* Mike Higgins (&quot;Star Brand&quot;): &quot;No No-Prizes for New Universe no-no&#x27;s no way!&quot;
* Larry Hama (&quot;Conan&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;): &quot;No one writes in for them in the &quot;Conan&quot; books so we don&#x27;t award them. On &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, which I write, I give them to people who get me out of jams if they are very ingenious about it.&quot;
* Archie Goodwin (Epic): &quot;We acknowledge our mistakes in print, but Epic Comics doesn&#x27;t award No-Prizes.&quot;
* Bob Budiansky (&quot;Secret Wars II&quot;): &quot;If someone finds a clever enough explanation for what seems to be a mistake, I&#x27;ll send them a No-Prize.&quot;
* Bob Harras (&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;X-Factor&quot;): &quot;My policy is if a certain mistake wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me when I was a kid, it&#x27;s not worth a No-Prize. But if someone does really help us out, I&#x27;ll send them one.&quot;
* Don Daley (&quot;Captain America&quot;): &quot;First I place a temporal statute of limitations on No-Prize mistakes. If the mistake is more than six issues old, it doesn&#x27;t qualify anymore. Second, I only give them out for things that count, not trivial nitpicking and faultfinding. Third, the explanation should not only be logical but emotionally appealing. I don&#x27;t award many of them.&quot;
* James Owsley (&quot;Spider-Man&quot;): &quot;We only mail them out to people who send us the best possible explanations for important mistakes. Panels where someone&#x27;s shirt is colored wrong do not count. We send out the No-Prize envelopes to everyone who gets the same best answer, and sometimes will send out postcards to runners-up who come close.&quot;
* Ralph Macchio (&quot;Daredevil&quot;): &quot;The No-Prize is an honored Marvel tradition. Of course I give them away—for just about any old stupid thing. I have a million of them.&quot;

A typical mid-1980s attempt at a No-Prize comes from the letters page of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #324 (Oct. 1986), in response to &quot;Hulk&quot; #321: &quot;. . . On page 12, panel 5, Wonder Man&#x27;s glasses are knocked off, but in following panels on the next page, he has them on. He didn&#x27;t have enough time to get them after they fell off, and Hawkeye&#x27;s explosive arrow probably would have destroyed them when it detonated on the Hulk. Never fear, though. I have the solution — while flying down to help Hawkeye, Wonder Man pulled out an extra pair he carries in case of just such emergencies.&quot; (Editor Bob Harras awarded the writer a No-Prize.)

Editor Mark Gruenwald believed the quest for No-Prizes negatively impacted the quality of letters sent to comic book letter columns, as readers were becoming more focused on nitpicking and pointing out errors than in responding to the comics&#x27; stories themselves (he even cited one letter which focused on Captain America&#x27;s glove being yellow in one panel, instead of the correct color red). Gruenwald then temporarily adopted a new policy, which was to award No-Prizes to readers who not only pointed out an error but also devised a clever explanation as to why it was not really an error (Gruenwald was also known for awarding the &quot;fred-prize&quot; to readers of &quot;Captain America&quot;). But in 1986, still believing that the quest for No-Prizes was degrading the quality of reader communication, Gruenwald informed the public that his office would no longer award No-Prizes at all.

In January 1989, Marvel was purchased by Ronald Perelman. One of the first casualties of the new financial belt-tightening was the No-Prize, considered in one memo to be &quot;a silly, expensive extravagance to mail out&quot;.

=== Early 1990s reinstatement ===
In 1991, then-Marvel editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco reinstated the No-Prize, introducing the &quot;meritorious service to Marvel above and beyond the call of duty&quot; criteria:

In the late 1990s, Stan Lee returned to writing the Bullpen Bulletins column. He would answer fan questions, and anyone whose question was used would receive a physical No-Prize. 

No-Prizes were still irregularly offered for any number of reasons. In one instance, for example, the first reader to name the last story Stan Lee wrote before becoming Marvel&#x27;s publisher was promised a No-Prize.

=== Digital No-Prize ===
On July 31, 2006, Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort instituted the digital No-Prize to be awarded for &quot;meritorious service to Marveldom&quot;. The first was awarded on August 12, 2006, to a group of Marvel fans who donated a large number of comics to U.S. service members stationed in Iraq.

=== 2023 variants ===
In February 2023, Marvel released three variant covers featuring No-Prize envelopes. The covers were printed on &quot;Amazing Spider-Man #19&quot;, &quot;Black Panther #14&quot;, and &quot;Hulk #12&quot;.

== No-Prize book ==

In late 1982 (cover dated January 1983), Marvel published a humorous one-shot comic featuring some of their most notorious goofs. Subtitled &quot;Mighty Marvel&#x27;s Most Massive Mistakes&quot;, the book was organized and spearheaded by Jim Owsley and had a cover which was deliberately printed upside-down. In the comic&#x27;s story Lee, with the help of artists Bob Camp and Vince Colletta, exposes and pokes fun at typos, misspellings and other errors.

<text>Chris Thor Roner (born March 4, 1980) is a former American soccer player. He played for the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. His brother Erik Roner was a professional skier and base jumper who starred in the Nitro Circus series on MTV.

 Roner (pronounced &quot;Ron-ear&quot;) played four years of college soccer at University of California, Berkeley where he was Team Captain, First Team Pac-10 and MVP his final three years. He was selected 33rd overall by the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. As a rookie, Roner saw limited playing time. The following year, in 2003, he was instrumental in helping the Quakes win the MLS Cup. In the Western Conference semifinals against the Los Angeles Galaxy, Roner scored the tying goal in the 90th minute, capping the &quot;greatest comeback game&quot; in MLS history.

At MLS Cup 2003, Roner was substituted early in the second half and scored the first own goal in MLS Cup history. Minutes later, he conceded the first penalty kick in MLS Cup history, but San Jose won the match 4–2 and clinched the championship.

After the 2003 championship, Roner underwent a routine arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle, but the cartilage damage was so severe that it ended his soccer career early. He attempted to revive his career in 2005, being called into the San Jose pre-season camp, but was unable to play through the pain. After retiring, Roner worked at an advertising firm in San Francisco.

<text>Jason King is a British television series starring Peter Wyngarde as the eponymous character. It was produced by ITC Entertainment and had a single season of 26 one-hour episodes that aired from 1971 to 1972. It was shown internationally as well, and has been released on DVD in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Germany.

==Overview==
The series featured the further adventures of the title character who had first appeared in &quot;Department S&quot; (1969). In that series he was a dilettante dandy and author of a series of adventure novels, working as part of a team of investigators. In &quot;Jason King&quot; he had left that service to concentrate on writing the adventures of Mark Caine, who closely resembled Jason King in looks, manner, style, and personality. None of the other regular characters from &quot;Department S&quot; appeared in this series, although Department S itself is occasionally referred to in dialogue.

In the course of visiting international locations as part of his research, or through being summoned by people needing assistance, King would be frequently embroiled in adventure stories featuring glamorous women, exotic locations, menacing villains, political turmoil, or espionage intrigue.

The first episode depicted King&#x27;s retelling of a Mark Caine novel to a television executive, alternating between King&#x27;s interpretation of events, and the television executive&#x27;s version. King&#x27;s version showed style and class, while the executive&#x27;s version featured added suspense, more cliches, and had the women in more revealing costumes. In the footage representing both men&#x27;s vision of the novel adapted for the screen, Mark Caine was portrayed by Wyngarde.

The titles of the Mark Caine books often consisted of four short words, in the manner of some of Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novels. The Mark Caine title mentioned most often in the series was &quot;Index Finger Left Hand&quot;; another was &quot;To China Yours Sincerely&quot; (parodying Fleming&#x27;s &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;).

Subsequent episodes featured Wyngarde playing King trying to write his novels and being pressured by his publisher Nicola Harvester about deadlines. King, however, was usually distracted by women and the adventures of his normal life, and was sometimes tricked by Ryland of the British Government into assisting the Government in international political matters: all of which later found their way into the adventures of the fictional Mark Caine.

==Cast==

*Peter Wyngarde as Jason King
*Anne Sharp as Nicola Harvester
*Ronald Lacey as Ryland
*Dennis Price as Sir Brian

==Production==
The series was created by Dennis Spooner and like its predecessor was made by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment production company (which had become successful with such series as &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;Danger Man&quot;). However, unlike previous ITC series which were shot on 35mm film, &quot;Jason King&quot; was filmed on 16mm to cut costs. Episodes were written specifically to include travel to various European locations to which Peter Wyngarde had, before the series, been brought for outdoor location filming; these shots were then included within the filmed narratives.

==Episodes==
==Legacy==
King&#x27;s choice of fashion was named by Mike Myers as an inspiration for his popular movie character Austin Powers.

He is also one of the inspirations (especially his clothes) for Kim Newman&#x27;s psychic crime fighter and secret agent Richard Jeperson.

==Parody==
&quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; performed a sketch entitled &#x27;Jason King&#x27;, with Ronnie Corbett putting on all the airs and graces of King and Ronnie Barker playing a suspect in a murder investigation, during their third series in 1973.

Jason King was also the basis for Jason Bentley, played by Peter Richardson in the &quot;Comic Strip Presents&quot; episode &quot;Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; (1993). Wyngarde said in a BBC television interview when this episode was originally transmitted that he was flattered by the affectionate parody, but insisted that Jason King would never wear crushed velvet.

<doc id="1194301" wikidata="Q966287" url="?curid=1194301" title="Carpenter (crater)">
<text>Carpenter is a lunar impact crater in the northern part of the Moon, relatively close to the limb (as viewed from earth). At this position the crater is foreshortened and appears oval in shape. It is, however, very nearly circular in outline. The outer to the south is adjoined to the old crater Anaximander, and the satellite formation Anaximander B lies along the western rim. To the northeast is Anaximenes.

In geological terms Carpenter is a somewhat young lunar crater, with features that have not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts. Certainly it is much younger than the surrounding crater formations. The inner wall displays an appearance of slumping, particularly along the eastern face, and there is some development of s. The outer rim is unmarked by craterlets of note, but there is a small crater along the south-southeastern inner wall. The crater has a ray system, and is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.

The interior floor within the sloping inner walls is generally level, but irregular with many small bumps and hills. Near the midpoint is an unusual double central peak formation, with a smaller peak offset to the west and a larger ridge offset to the east. The latter ridge runs southward to the edge of the inner wall.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Carpenter.

<doc id="1194302" wikidata="Q350498" url="?curid=1194302" title="Sigurd II">
<text>Sigurd Haraldsson (; 1133 – 10 June 1155), or Sigurd II, also called Sigurd Munn, was king of Norway from 1136 to 1155. He was son of Harald IV Gille, king of Norway and his mistress Thora Guttormsdotter (). He served as co-ruler with his half-brothers, Inge Haraldsson and Eystein II Haraldsson. His epithet Munn means &quot;the Mouth&quot; in Old Norse. He was killed in the power-struggle against his brother, Inge, in an early stage of the civil war era in Norway.

==Reign==
Sigurd was fostered by Guttorm (&quot;Guthormr&quot;) or Sådegyrd Bårdsson (&quot;Sáðagyrðr Bárðarson&quot;) in Trøndelag. When his father was murdered by the pretender Sigurd Slembe in 1136, Sigurd was made king at the thing of &quot;Eyrathing&quot;. At the same time, his brothers Inge and Magnus were also made kings and co-rulers. Their respective guardians joined forces against Sigurd Slembe and his ally, the former king Magnus the Blind. The battles against these pretenders dominated the early years of Sigurd&#x27;s reign. In 1139, they were defeated and slain at the Battle of Holmengrå.

After this followed a period of peace. During the minority of the brothers, Sigurd, Inge and Magnus, the Norwegian nobility cooperated to rule the kingdom and advise the kings. In 1142, their brother Eystein came to Norway from Scotland. His parentage was accepted, since Harald Gille had acknowledged that he had a son overseas. Eystein thus became king and co-ruler together with Sigurd and Inge. Magnus, of whom little more is known, died of natural causes at some point in the 1140s.

In 1152, Norway was visited by the papal legate Nicholas Breakspear. During his visit, the church in Norway was organised into a separate archbishopric, with its seat at Nidaros.

As they grew up, and their old advisors died, hostility began to grow among the brothers. In 1155, all three of them were set to meet in Bergen in an effort to keep the peace. Inge accused Sigurd and Eystein of planning to have him dethroned. Sigurd denied the accusations, but a few days later one of Inge&#x27;s guards was killed by one of Sigurd&#x27;s. At the advice of his mother Ingrid and his senior advisor, Gregorius Dagsson, Inge ordered his men to assault the house where Sigurd was residing. Sigurd had but few men, and no mercy was given. King Sigurd fell on 6 February 1155. He was buried by the old cathedral of Bergen, in what is today Bergenhus Fortress This cathedral was demolished and replaced by a larger cathedral soon after.

==Aftermath==
King Eystein was late in arriving for the meeting, and only approached the city after Sigurd was already dead. An uneasy settlement was reached between Inge and Eystein, but peace between them did not last long. As it turned out, the killing of king Sigurd started the second phase of the Norwegian civil war era, with fighting continuing with only short let-ups until 1208. The reasons for the fighting in Bergen remain disputed. According to the sagas, Eystein and Sigurd had plotted to strip Inge of his royal title and divide his share of the kingdom between them. Some modern historians doubt this version, seeing it as Inge’s excuse for his own aggressive actions.

During the following civil wars, several royal pretenders claimed to be the son of King Sigurd. For some, this was probably mostly a political statement, as royal lineage was necessary to be a candidate for the throne. Sverre Sigurdsson was the most successful by far of these claimants, and eventually succeeded in becoming king of Norway. Sigurd never married.

The sagas draw a rather negative picture of both Sigurd and his brother Eystein, generally choosing to portray Inge as the just ruler of the three brothers. &quot;Heimskringla&quot; writes of Sigurd:

:&quot;When King Sigurd grew up he was a very ungovernable, restless man in every way; and so was King Eystein, but Eystein was the more reasonable of the two. King Sigurd was a stout and strong man, of a brisk appearance; he had light brown hair, an ugly mouth; but otherwise a well-shaped countenance. He was polite in his conversation beyond any man, and was expert in all exercises.&quot;

==Descendants==
*Haakon II Sigurdsson (&quot;Hákon&quot;), known as &quot;Haakon the Broadshouldered&quot; (1147–1162). Made king by Sigurd and Eystein&#x27;s supporters after Eystein&#x27;s fall in 1157, in opposition to Inge Haraldsson. Killed in battle against Inge&#x27;s old supporters and their new king Magnus Erlingsson. Mother: Tora (&quot;Þóra&quot;).
*Sigurd Sigurdsson Markusfostre (&quot;Sigurðr&quot;), known as &quot;Sigurd Markusfostre&quot; (died 1163). Proclaimed king by Haakon the Broadshouldered&#x27;s followers in 1162, captured and decapitated by king Magnus&#x27; supporters in 1163.
*Harald Sigurdsson (&quot;Haraldr&quot;), (died 1170s). Captured and executed by king Magnus&#x27; supporters, because his parentage made him a potential threat to Magnus&#x27; rule. Mother: Kristin Sigurdsdotter (&quot;Kristín Sigurðardóttir&quot;).
*Cecilia Sigurdsdotter (died late 1180s). Married Folkvid the Lawspeaker, marriage later annulled. Mother of Haakon the Crazy. Remarried Bård Guttormsson (&quot;Bárðr Guthormsson&quot;)
* Helga Sigurdsdatter (Vestfold, c. 1152 - Bergen, 1202), &quot;frilledatter&quot;, &quot;Princess of Norway&quot;. Mother: Gunnhild Stadheim Giske (Stadheim, 1130 - 1200). Wife of Hjarande Hallvarson Hvite (Vestlandet, 1140 - Lier, 1220-1230), a nobleman from Western Norway living in 1165, &quot;adelsmann på Vestlandet&quot;, and had issue 

===Disputed===
* Sverre Sigurdsson (&quot;Sverrir&quot;), (died 1202). Ruled as king of Norway from 1184 until his death. Mother: Gunnhild Stadheim Giske (Stadheim, 1130 - 1200). Whether he was in fact a son of Sigurd is highly dubious. Sverris saga, the saga of Sigurd&#x27;s alleged son, also draws a somewhat unfavourable picture of Sigurd, contrasting him with the positive qualities of Sverre.
* Eirik? (&quot;Eiríkr&quot;) Sigurdsson? (died 1190). Made Jarl by king Sverre. Poisoned. Whether he was in fact a son of Sigurd is unknown.

==Sources==
The main sources to Sigurd’s reign are the kings’ sagas Heimskringla, Fagrskinna, Morkinskinna and Ágrip. The three former base at least part of their account on the older saga Hryggjarstykki, which was written some time between 1150 and 1170, and was thus a near-contemporary source. This saga itself has not been preserved.

<text>The United Arab States (UAS, ) was a short-lived confederation between the United Arab Republic and the Kingdom of Yemen from 1958 to 1961.
The United Arab Republic was a sovereign state formed by the union of Egypt and Syria in 1958. The same year, the Kingdom of Yemen, which had already signed a defense pact with Egypt, entered a loose confederation with the UAR called the United Arab States on March 8. One reason for this decision was because North Yemen had felt threatened by its considerably larger and more powerful northern neighbor Saudi Arabia and saw the confederation as a source of security. However, unlike the constituent countries of the United Arab Republic, North Yemen remained an independent sovereign state, maintaining its UN membership and separate embassies throughout the whole period of confederation.

Neither the union nor the confederation fulfilled their role as vehicles of pan-Arabism or Arab nationalism, resulting in its dissolution in 1961.

<text>Louis Tracy (1863–1928) was a British journalist, and prolific writer of fiction. He used the pseudonyms Gordon Holmes and Robert Fraser, which were at times shared with M. P. Shiel, a collaborator from the start of the twentieth century.

He was born in Liverpool to a well-to-do middle-class family. At first he was educated at home and then at the French Seminary at Douai. Around 1884 he became a reporter for a local paper, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; at Darlington, circulating in parts of Durham and North Yorkshire; later he worked for papers in Cardiff and Allahabad. During 1892–1894 he was closely associated with Arthur Harmsworth, in &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Evening News and Post&quot;.

His fiction included mystery, adventure and romance.

<doc id="1194327" wikidata="Q6517197" url="?curid=1194327" title="Watford, Northamptonshire">
<text>Watford is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 224 people, including Murcott and increasing to 320 at the 2011 Census. Watford is home to Watford Gap services, the UK&#x27;s oldest motorway service station, located directly on the M1 motorway and alongside the West Coast Main Line.

== History of Watford ==

===Roman era to the 5th century===
It is known that the important Roman road Watling Street was constructed on the western boundary of the village. In the Roman era the Roman settlement of Bannaventa (&#x27;A Gap in the Hills&#x27;), with defensive earth and timber ramparts and a ditch, was situated about two miles south-west of Watford. Today some remains of the settlement such as building platforms, mounds and crop marks are still visible.

===Anglo-Saxon period===
After the departure of the Romans, the area eventually became part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia. Watford is mentioned as one of the lands belonging to Ethelgifu and was probably inherited from her own kindred. In the 7th century the Mercians converted to Christianity with the death of pagan King Penda. About 889 the area was conquered by the Danes and became part of the Danelaw – with Watling Street serving as the boundary. This was in effect until the area was recaptured by the English about 917 under Wessex King Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great. In 940 the Vikings of York captured Northamptonshire and devastated the area, with the county retaken by the English in 942. Northamptonshire is one of the few counties to have both Saxon and Danish town-names and settlements. This may be reflected in the place-name&#x27;s etymology, where both Old Scandinavian &#x27;vað&#x27; has been coupled with its English translation, &#x27;ford&#x27;. Alternatively, the first element may be a Scandinavianised form of original Old English &#x27;gewæd&#x27;, with the same meaning, or else Old English &#x27;wāþ&#x27; (&#x27;hunting&#x27;).

===1066 and later===
In 1066 the local Saxon lord is recorded as Thor, a common Scandinavian name that may have dated back to the Viking invasions of several centuries prior. The first known recording of the affairs of Watford village is in the Domesday Book of 1086. At that time Watford was considered a fairly large village with a population that could have been more than 100 people. By 1086 the Saxons had been ousted by the Normans and Gilbert the Cook was Lord and Tenant-in-Chief of Watford and another parish. Baldwin was the son and successor of Gilbert in the reign of King Henry I. By the time Baldwin died in the first year of Henry II, Watford was held by the Barony of Brunn which was held by Baldwin. The Barony and Watford with it passed to the husband of one of Baldwin&#x27;s daughters, Hugo Wac, who became the Baron of Brunn succeeding his wife&#x27;s father.

===Medieval era===
Watford has extensive settlement remains for an earlier form of the village in the medieval era. There is a stone building, and remains of gardens, traces of medieval dwellings, house-sites, paddocks, etc. Additionally, there are reconstructed cottages from this era. The significance of the medieval village remains is underscored by the adjoining ridge and furrow, evidence of an extensive medieval cultivation system which provided rich, well-drained land for crop planting.

== Present day ==
Watford is close to the nationally known Watford Gap motorway service station. The original &quot;North of Watford&quot; expression was already in use many years before the Watford Gap Service Station or M1 opened in 1959. It is possible that the original phrase referred to the much larger town of Watford in Hertfordshire, which was the last urban stop on the main railway line out of London to the north of England. There is evidence to support this, as the phrase &quot;North of Watford Junction&quot; was used with similar meaning in the past, referring to Watford Junction railway station at Watford, Hertfordshire. Watford gives its name to the Watford Locks on the Grand Union Canal. Christadelphians have been using the village hall for meetings since the 2000s.

From 1838 until 1958, the village was served by nearby Welton railway station.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of 21 listed buildings and one scheduled monument in the parish of Watford. All of the listed buildings are Grade II except for St Peter &amp; St Paul&#x27;s Church which is Grade I. The properties concerned include:
*St Peter &amp; St Paul&#x27;s Church, Church Street
*Tile House, Main Street
*Watford Park: Remains of an 18th-century garden overlying the shrunken medieval village of Watford and associated ridge and furrow cultivation.

==Notable residents==
Pilgrim Father Thomas Rogers was born in Watford about 1572. He was the son of William Rogers and his wife Eleanor. He married Alice Cosford at Watford in 1597 and had six children baptised there between 1599 and 1613. The family joined the Separatist Church at Leiden in the Netherlands sometime after 1613. Thomas Rogers became a citizen of Leiden on 25 June 1618, and records state he was a merchant of camlet cloth (a combination of silk and camelhair). It is possible Alice Rogers died sometime before 1620 since, per 1622 records, a woman named Elizabeth (Elsgen), possibly his second wife, cared for the Rogers children left behind when Thomas and his son Joseph sailed for the New World.

Thomas Rogers and his son Joseph, aged about 18, went to North America on the Pilgrim ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620, while his other children remained in the Netherlands. Some of those children are known to have later gone to New England. Thomas died, as did many other &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers, during that first winter in Plymouth Colony, 1620–21. His son Joseph survived to live a long life as a person of note in the colony.

<text>Cleo Virginia Andrews (June 6, 1923 – December 19, 1986), better known as V. C. Andrews or Virginia C. Andrews, was an American novelist. She was best known for her 1979 novel &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, which inspired two movie adaptations and four sequels. While her novels are not classified by her publisher as Young Adult, their young protagonists have made them popular among teenagers for decades. After her death in 1986, a ghostwriter who was initially hired to complete two unfinished works has continued to publish books under her name.

==Profile==
Andrews&#x27;s novels combine Gothic horror and family saga, revolving around family secrets and forbidden love (frequently involving themes of horrific events, and sometimes including a rags-to-riches story). Her best-known novel is the bestseller &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; (1979), a tale of four children smuggled into the attic of their wealthy estranged pious grandmother, and held prisoner there by their mother.

Her novels were successful enough that following Andrews&#x27;s death, her estate hired a ghost writer, Andrew Neiderman, to continue to write novels to be published under her name. In assessing a deficiency in her estate tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service argued (successfully) that Virginia Andrews&#x27;s name was a valuable commercial asset, the value of which should be included in her gross estate.

Her novels have been translated into Czech, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Greek, Finnish, Hungarian, Swedish, Polish, Portuguese, Lithuanian, Chinese, Russian and Hebrew.

==Life==
Andrews was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, the youngest child and only daughter of Lillian Lilnora (Parker), a telephone operator, and William Henry Andrews, a tool-and-die maker. She had two older brothers, William Jr. and Eugene. Andrews grew up attending Southern Baptist and Methodist churches. As a teenager, Andrews suffered a fall from a school stairwell, resulting in severe back injuries. The subsequent surgery to correct these injuries resulted in Andrews&#x27; suffering from crippling arthritis that required her to use crutches and a wheelchair for much of her life. However, having always shown promise as an artist, she was able to complete a four-year correspondence course from her home and soon became a successful commercial artist, illustrator, and portrait painter, using her art commissions to support the family after her father&#x27;s death in 1957.

Later in life, Andrews turned to writing. Her first novel, written in 1972 and titled &quot;Gods of Green Mountain&quot;, was a science fiction effort that remained unpublished during her lifetime but was eventually released as an e-book in 2004.

In 1975, Andrews completed a manuscript for a novel she called &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;. &quot;I wrote it in two weeks,&quot; Andrews said. The novel was returned with the suggestion that she &quot;spice up&quot; and expand the story. In later interviews, Andrews claims to have made the necessary revisions in a single night. The novel, published in 1979, was an instant popular success, reaching the top of the bestseller lists in only two weeks. Every year thereafter until her death, Andrews published a new novel, each publication earning Andrews larger advances and a growing popular readership.

&quot;I think I tell a whopping good story. And I don&#x27;t drift away from it a great deal into descriptive material,&quot; she stated in &quot;Faces of Fear&quot; in 1985. &quot;When I read, if a book doesn&#x27;t hold my interest in what&#x27;s going to happen next, I put it down and don&#x27;t finish it. So I&#x27;m not going to let anybody put one of my books down and not finish it. My stuff is a very fast read.&quot; In an interview for Twilight Magazine in 1983, Andrews was questioned about the critics&#x27; response to her work. She answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the critics say. I used to, until I found out that most critics are would-be writers who are just jealous because I&#x27;m getting published and they aren&#x27;t. I also don&#x27;t think that anybody cares about what they say. Nor should they care.&quot;

Andrews died of breast cancer on December 19, 1986, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. After her death, her family hired a ghostwriter, Andrew Neiderman, to finish the manuscripts she had started. He would complete the next two novels, &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Fallen Hearts&quot;, and they were published soon after. These two novels are considered the last to bear the &quot;V. C. Andrews&quot; name and to be almost completely written by Andrews herself.

==Fiction==

The following books written by (and credited to) V. C. Andrews were published within her lifetime:

* &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; (1980)
* &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot; (1981)
* &quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot; (1982) 
* &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Heaven&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Dark Angel&quot; (1986)

The following two posthumous volumes were credited solely to V. C. Andrews, and were completed by Andrew Neiderman based on outlines, story fragments, or work partially finished by Andrews before her death:
* &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Fallen Hearts&quot; (1988)

All new &quot;V. C. Andrews&quot; work published subsequent to 1988, while credited solely to Andrews, is the work of Neiderman, under license from the V. C. Andrews estate. Neiderman has revisited some of Andrews&#x27; original characters and settings, while also creating numerous new series that explore similar themes. A listing of works and series credited under the name &quot;V. C. Andrews&quot; follows.

===By V. C. Andrews and Andrew Neiderman===
====The Dollanganger Family Series====
Andrews&#x27; first series of novels was published between 1979 and 1987.

&quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; focus on the four Dollanganger siblings and the events that shattered their perfect life after a car accident kills their father and their eventual imprisonment in their grandparents&#x27; attic as their mother tries to win back the love of her dying estranged father who must not know of the existence of her four children. &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; tells of their incarceration at Foxworth Hall, the death of one child, and subsequent escape of the other three, with &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; picking up directly after telling the story of life outside the attic walls and Cathy&#x27;s eventual revenge on the mother that locked them away. The story then continues in &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, which follows Cathy&#x27;s sons, Jory and Bart, and the mysterious new neighbor who befriends Bart, gradually turning him against his parents; to the eventual reconstruction of Foxworth Hall (which had previously burnt down in &quot;Petals&quot;) in &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot;. &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;, a prequel, tells the grandparents&#x27; story and how the children&#x27;s parents became involved with each other, leading to the events of the first novel.

A sequel was published 34 years later, to tie in with the &quot;Lifetime&quot; adaptation of &quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot;, by Andrew Neiderman.

Eventually Heaven leaves to go live with her maternal grandfather at Farthinggale Manor where she discovers the secrets of her mother and who her actual father is.

<text>Baywatch Nights is an American science-fiction mystery drama television series that aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997. Created by Douglas Schwartz, David Hasselhoff, and Gregory J. Bonann, the series is a spin-off from the television series, &quot;Baywatch&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The original premise of the series was that during a midlife crisis, Sgt. Garner Ellerbee (Gregory Alan Williams), who was the resident police officer of &quot;Baywatch&quot; since the beginning of the series, decides to quit his job as a police officer and form a detective agency. Mitch Buchannon (David Hasselhoff), his friend from &quot;Baywatch&quot;, joins to support him and they are, in turn, joined by a detective named Ryan McBride (Angie Harmon). Singer Lou Rawls, who starred in the first season, performed the series theme song, &quot;After the Sun Goes Down&quot;, alongside David Hasselhoff. Rawls played the role of Lou Raymond, owner of the nightclub where the detective agency rented its office. Midway into the first season, the series added two new cast members: Eddie Cibrian and Donna D&#x27;Errico.

For the second season, facing slipping ratings which were never as good as the original series&#x27;, the producers decided to switch to a science-fiction format (inspired by the success of &quot;The X-Files&quot;). Gregory Alan Williams left the series and was replaced by Dorian Gregory as Diamont Teague, a paranormal expert. The new format did not help the series and it was canceled after the second season. The character Donna Marco was later carried over to the original &quot;Baywatch&quot; series afterwards.

<text>The Salteens are a Canadian indie pop group based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The band released several albums of light pop music, toured in Canada and Australia; a number of their tracks were in rotation on CBC Radio.

==History==
The Salteens formed in Vancouver in 1997. Their 2000 debut LP &quot;Short-Term Memories&quot; was released on Endearing Records. For the next two years the band performed in support of this release, earning a fan base in Canada, Australia, Japan and the United States. &quot;Short-Term Memories&quot; rose to the top of Canada&#x27;s national college-radio chart, and was nominated in the category of Best Alternative Album at Canadian Music Week&#x27;s 2001 Independent Music Awards.

The band&#x27;s second release, &quot;Let Go of Your Bad Days&quot; was produced by Kevin Kane, with contributions from Ryan Dahle and Pete Bastard. It consisted of ten short tracks, and was released in 2003. The album was also released in Australia, supported by an opening berth on tour with Australian indie-pop bands The Lucksmiths and Jebediah.

Zellers, a Canadian discount department store, used the song &quot;Nice Day&quot; in its spring 2007 commercial. In addition, the band guest-starred and performed in 28 August 2007 episode of &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; titled &quot;Happy.&quot; The band wrote two songs for &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;: &quot;Be Nice to Animals&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Happy I Can Dance&quot;.

In February 2008 the band released two songs for free download on their official website. The songs were &quot;Hallowed Ways&quot; and &quot;Sunnyside St.&quot;. In March they released an additional two tracks: &quot;Don&#x27;t Break My Heart&quot; and &quot;Everything They Know About Us&quot;.

On 11 May 2010 the band released a digital EP containing six songs entitled &quot;Moths&quot;. The songs are the product of a number of recording sessions that took place during 2007 and 2008 in Vancouver. That year The Salteens recorded the band&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Grey Eyes&quot;, with producer Todd Simko. It was released in October though their own label, Boompa Records, and appeared on the !Earshot National Top 50 Chart.

<text>Yelvertoft is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 821 people, reducing to 764 at the 2011 Census, increasing again to 804 at the 2021 census.

Yelvertoft&#x27;s main thoroughfare, called High Street, is approximately three quarters of a mile long, from the Parish Church of All Saints to the Village Hall. This linear street follows the course of an ancient Portway known as Salters Way.
==History==
The village was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086, where a priest was mentioned.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;curtilage of Geldfrith&#x27;. Old English &#x27;cot&#x27;, &#x27;cotu&#x27;, &#x27;cottage(s)&#x27; may have been the original generic.

Yelvertoft has maintained a more independent, rural character compared to other villages in the region, such as Crick, because no major transport routes pass through it.

Sites of historical interest include a monument built for the 13th century Rector of the All Saints Church, John Drycson, a charity school building constructed in 1792 (the school was established in 1711) which now serves as the Reading Room, and a town pump dating from 1900, which was renovated in 2000.

==Geography==

Yelvertoft lies on a limestone rock belt which stretches from the south coast to Yorkshire.

The village is located in an area of relatively flat land and low hills called the Vale of Rugby. Roughly 4 km to the east of the village, the eastern edge of the Vale can be found at the beginning of the northern Northamptonshire Uplands and Hemplow Hills, roughly beginning at Honey Hill to the west of Elkington, and stretching south past Cracks Hill to the Watford Gap.

To the west of the village, the vale continues until the edge of the Dunsmore Heath, roughly 6 km away,at the edge of the town of Rugby, beyond Lilbourne.

Flowing through the northern edge of the village, the Yelvertoft Brook, a tributary of the Avon can be found. Due to the low-lying nature of the village, and the sometimes heavy flow of water through the brook, the village has experienced flooding on several occasions, most recently in February 2024.

==Demography==
According to the figures obtained at the Census 2001 there are 851 people living in the village, in a total of some 356 houses.

==Facilities==
Yelvertoft has three churches (Anglican, Congregational, Roman Catholic), a primary school, a butcher&#x27;s shop/delicatessen, a public house, an Equestrian centre and many small businesses.

Recreational facilities are mainly centred around the village hall and comprises a sports field with cricket and football pitches, a pocket park, children&#x27;s play area, skate park and a basketball court.

==Sport==

;Cricket
Yelvertoft currently only has a cricket team, Yelvertoft Cricket Club, which was established in 1905. The club previously operated out of their old ground on the bridleway between Yelvertoft and Crick via Cracks Hill, but moved to the new cricket pitch at the village hall in 2009. They currently operate two teams, with the first XI being in division seven of the Northants Cricket League system.

;Football
Yelvertoft previously had a football team which played regularly in the Rugby and District Sunday League division and was established in 1987. In 2023 the club ceased operating regularly, however a charity match is still organised every Christmas, they played in a black and white strip.

;Rugby Union
Yelvertoft previously had a Rugby team which operated until 1999, playing under the name the &quot;Knightley Arms Games Society (KnAGS)&quot;. The team played in a navy and white strip. The Knightley Arms was used for changing and catering, and games took place on a rugby pitch next to canal bridge 21 to the east of the village. The pitch was deconstructed in 2004. The KnAGS also organised walks and other charity events outside of their rugby team.

==Transport links==
Yelvertoft has few accessible transport links.

;Bus
There are currently no regular bus services to or from Yelvertoft.

;Rail
Railway stations in towns near Yelvertoft include Long Buckby, Market Harborough, Rugby and Northampton. The village previously had access to the Yelvertoft and Stanford Park railway station, which lay around 3 km to the north of Yelvertoft, but this was closed in 1966.

;Road
Yelvertoft is linked by road with access to Junction 18 of the M1 motorway within 5 minutes drive from the village. Following improvements to Catthorpe interchange in 2016/17 it is no longer possible to leave or join either the M1 or M6 from local roads at Junction 19. Junction 1 of the M6 and J20 of the M1 are both within 15 minutes drive from Yelvertoft.

;Canal
The Grand Union Canal passes close to the village.

<doc id="1194348" wikidata="Q2168666" url="?curid=1194348" title="Atlantic tripletail">
<text>The Atlantic tripletail (Lobotes surinamensis), also known as the black grunt, black perch, buoy fish, buoyfish, brown triple tail, brown tripletail, conchy leaf, dusky triple-tail, dusky tripletail, flasher, sleepfish, triple tail, triple-tail, tripletail, or tripple tail is a species of marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Lobotidae. This fish is found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world except for the eastern Pacific Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic tripletail was first formally described in 1790 as &quot;Holocentrus surinamensis&quot; by the German physician and naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch with its type locality given as the Caribbean Sea off Suriname. In 1830 Georges Cuvier proposed the new genus &quot;Lobotes&quot; with &quot;Holocentrus surinamensis&quot; its type species by monotypy. Some authorities treat &quot;Lobotes&quot; as a monospecific genus with the Pacific tripletail (&quot;L. pacifica)&quot; being regarded as a synonym of a single pantropical &quot;L. surinamensis&quot;. &quot;Lobotes&quot; is one of two genera in the family Lobotidae which the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies in the order Spariformes.

==Description==
The Atlantic tripletail has an oval- to rhomboid-shaped, compressed body with a slightly concave forehead and an upper jaw which can be protruded a short distance. There is an outer row of small, densely set canine-like teeth in each jaw and an inner band of smaller teeth but no teeth on the roof of the mouth. The preoperculum is serrated, the serrations shrinking and multiplying as the fish ages, and the operculum has two flat, hidden spines. The continuous dorsal fin is supported by 12 robust spines and 15 or 16 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 11 soft rays. The soft rayed portions of the dorsal and anal fins are high and rounded and extend beyond the caudal peduncle to create the impression of three symmetrical caudal fins. The caudal fin itself is rounded. Adults are dark brown or greenish yellow on the upper body and head and greyish silver on the lower body. The pectoral fins are pale yellow with the other fins being a darker colour than the body. The caudal fin has a yellow margin. This species has a maximum published total length of , with being typical. Juveniles have a mottled body with a mix of yellow, brown and black.

== Geographical distribution ==
The Atlantic tripletail is the only fish in the family Lobotidae that can be found in the Atlantic Ocean. It is, however, distributed across tropical seas especially in the Indonesian region which is commonly found in wet markets such as in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.

In US waters, Atlantic tripletails are found from Massachusetts and Bermuda to Argentina, the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, from Madeira Island to the Gulf of Guinea, the eastern Pacific from Costa Rica to Peru, and the western Pacific from Japan to Fiji and Tuvalu. They are rarely found north of Chesapeake Bay. They are found on the Gulf Coast from April to October and then migrate to warmer waters during winter. In the spring, tripletails concentrate just offshore of two particular spots: Port Canaveral, Florida (March–June) and Jekyll Island, Georgia (April–July).

The Atlantic tripletail has been recorded as far north as the United Kingdom.

== Habitat ==
Atlantic tripletails are found coastally in most, but not all, tropical and subtropical seas. They are semimigratorial and pelagic. Normally solitary, they have been known to form schools. They can be found in bays, sounds, and estuaries during the summer. Juveniles are usually found swimming under patches of &quot;Sargassum&quot; algae. In the Gulf of Mexico, adults are usually found in open water, but can also be found in passes, inlets, and bays near river mouths. Large adults are sometimes found near the surface over deep, open water, although always associated with floating objects. Young fishes are also often found in or near shipwrecks, beams or supports, jetties, flotsam and sea buoys. Fry are usually found in waters that exceed 84 °F (29 °C), greater than 3.3‰ salinity, and more than 230 feet (70 m) deep.

Tripletail are well known for their unusual behavior of floating just beneath the surface with one side exposed, mimicking a leaf or floating debris. They are also known to be able to change between light and dark shades of their normal coloration. These behaviors may help juveniles avoid predators, and are also believed to be a feeding strategy. Located in rafts of flotsam, near buoys, channel markers, crab trap floats, and other floating structures that provide cover for prey species, tripletail floating on their side may appear to be part of this cover, allowing close approach before the prey are taken in ambush. The behavior has resulted in a rapidly increasing incidence of recreational fishermen sight-fishing for the floating tripletail, resulting in severe bag and length restrictions in Florida and Georgia to ensure future populations.

== Biology ==
=== Diet ===
Atlantic tripletails are opportunistic eaters; they feed on a variety of foods, mostly small finfish such as gulf menhaden, Atlantic bumpers, and anchovies. They also feed on invertebrates such as blue crabs and brown shrimp, as well as other benthic crustaceans.

=== Reproduction ===
Spawning primarily occurs in the summer along both the Atlantic and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coasts, with peaks during July and August. The species is known to spawn in open water, with peak spawning occurring in the summer months. Females can produce up to 700,000 eggs per spawning event, and the eggs are pelagic and buoyant. The larvae are planktonic and undergo significant morphological changes before settling to the substrate. Males reach sexual maturity at a smaller size and younger age than females. Large congregations of tripletails during the summer months in the inshore and nearshore waters of coastal Georgia suggest this area is a critical estuarian spawning habitat for the species. Larval Atlantic tripletails go through four levels of development; preflexion, flexion, postflexion, and transformation. By the time the larvae reach 0.16 in (4 mm), they have large eyes and concave heads. The larvae of Atlantic tripletails resemble those of other species such as boarfishes, some jacks, spadefishes, and bass.

=== Predators ===
Atlantic tripletail does not have many predators but is preyed upon by a variety of larger predators, including sharks, barracudas, and other large predatory fish. Juvenile tripletail are also vulnerable to predation by birds, such as pelicans and gulls, which can be attracted to floating debris where the fish are sheltering.

=== Parasites ===
Parasites of the tripletail include the copepods &quot;Anuretes heckelii&quot; which affects the gills, &quot;Lernanthropus pupa&quot; which affects the gill filaments, and the ectoparasitic copepod &quot;Caligus tenius&quot;.

== Importance to humans ==
A few tons of Atlantic tripletails are fished commercially on the east and west coasts of Florida, and marketed fresh, frozen, or salted. They are mainly caught using haul seines, gill nets, and line gear. They are common taken as bycatch in driftnet catches of tuna along the edge of the continental shelf. It is a popular target for recreational anglers and its flesh is highly palatable and is considered superior to some other game fishes.

== Conservation ==
The Atlantic tripletail is listed as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Both Florida and Georgia have a bag limit of two fish per day for recreational fishing. In Florida, the minimum length is 18 in; in Georgia, 18 in.

<doc id="1194354" wikidata="Q2126429" url="?curid=1194354" title="Three Tales (Flaubert)">
<text>Three Tales () is a work by Gustave Flaubert that was originally published in French in 1877. It consists of the short stories: &quot;A Simple Heart&quot;, &quot;Saint Julian the Hospitalier&quot;, and &quot;Hérodias&quot;.

== &quot;A Simple Heart&quot; ==
&quot;A Simple Heart&quot;, or in French, is a story about a servant girl named Felicité. After her one and only love Théodore purportedly marries a well-to-do woman to avoid conscription, Felicité quits the farm where she works and heads for Pont-l&#x27;Évèque, where she picks up work in a widow&#x27;s house as a servant. She is very loyal and easily lends her affections to the two children of her mistress, Mme Aubain. She gives entirely to others; although many take advantage of her, she is unaffected.

She has no husband, no children, and no property, and is reliant on her mistress to keep her; she is uneducated; her death is virtually unnoticed. Despite her life being seemingly pointless, she has within her the power to love, which she does even when she does not receive it in return. She also carries within her a yearning, a majestic quasi-religious sensibility which finds its apotheosis in the deification, as she dies, of her pet parrot, who floats above her deathbed, masquerading as the Holy Ghost. She lives a simple, unexamined life.

Flaubert&#x27;s challenge was to create the main protagonist as someone very different from the satirical characters appearing in his previous novels such as &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;.

== &quot;The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitalier&quot; ==

&quot;The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitalier&quot;, in French, is a story about Julian the Hospitaller. (Note that the story has nothing to do with the Order of Hospitallers, despite the similarity of the names.) He is predicted at birth to do great things. His father is told that he will marry into the family of a great emperor, while his mother is told that he will be a saint. They dote on him. After Julian kills a mouse who interrupted his concentration in church, his cruelty towards animals grows and culminates into his massacre of an entire valley of deer. A stag curses him to kill his own parents. He almost brings the curse to fruition twice: he drops a sword while standing on a ladder near his father, and he pins his mother&#x27;s white shawl against a wall with a javelin because it looked like bird&#x27;s wings. He leaves to escape his future (much like Oedipus).

Julian joins a band of vagrants, and they eventually grow into a huge army under his control. He makes a name for himself and marries rich, but never hunts. Finally, his wife convinces him to go hunt, and he is haunted by the spirits of all of the animals he has killed. He returns home to surprise his wife and finds a man and a woman in her bed. Unknown to him, his parents had arrived to see him, and his wife had given them her bed. He thinks that it is another man sleeping with his wife and murders them. He recognizes his misdeed and leaves once again.

Having given all of his possessions to his wife, Julian begs for food but is shunned for his deeds. He comes across a deserted river crossing and decides to live a life of servitude. One day, there is a great storm, and a leper wishes to cross. It is rough, but Julian does not give up. Once across, the leper&#x27;s requests increase. He wishes for food and wine, Julian&#x27;s bed, and finally the warmth of Julian&#x27;s body. When Julian gives the man everything without hesitation, the leper is revealed to be Jesus Christ himself, who takes Julian with him to heaven.

== &quot;Hérodias&quot; ==
&quot;Hérodias&quot; is the retelling of the beheading of John the Baptist. It starts slightly before the arrival of the Syrian governor, Vitellius. Herodias holds a huge birthday celebration for her second husband, Herod Antipas. Unknown to him, she has concocted a plan to behead John. According to Flaubert, this plan entails making her husband fall in love with her daughter, Salomé, leading to him promising her whatever she wants. Salomé, obviously in line with the instructions of her mother, will ask for John&#x27;s head. Everything goes as planned. John has been repeatedly insulting the royals, so the king does not think long before granting Salomé&#x27;s wish. The crowd gathered for the party waits anxiously while the executioner, Mannaeus, kills John. The story ends with some of John&#x27;s disciples awaiting the Messiah.

== Sources of inspiration ==
* &quot;A Simple Heart&quot; was inspired by several events in Flaubert&#x27;s own life: he also lived in a farmhouse in rural Normandy, he also was adrift in his studies, much like Paul. Most importantly, he had an epileptic seizure in the same way that Félicité does in the story.
* Gustave Flaubert wrote &quot;A Simple Heart&quot; under encouragement from his good friend and author George Sand.
* &quot;The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitalier&quot; was inspired by a large stained-glass window at Rouen Cathedral. Flaubert deliberately made his story markedly different from the story told in glass.
* &quot;Hérodias&quot; is based on the biblical figure of the same name. Flaubert based the section on the dance of Salomé from a bas-relief also at Rouen Cathedral and his own experience watching a young female dancer while in Egypt.
* &quot;A Simple Heart&quot; was the inspiration for &quot;Flaubert&#x27;s Parrot&quot;, a literary novel by Julian Barnes.
* &quot;Hérodias&quot; is said to have influenced Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; (1893) and Jules Massenet&#x27;s opera &quot;Hérodiade&quot; (1881); &quot;The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitalier&quot; was the basis for an opera of the same title by Camille Erlanger (1888).
* The story is described at length in Yann Martel&#x27;s novel &quot;Beatrice and Virgil&quot;.

<doc id="1194359" wikidata="Q7993648" url="?curid=1194359" title="Whilton Locks">
<text>Whilton Locks is the name of a flight of seven locks on the Grand Union Canal near Daventry, in the county of Northamptonshire, England. They are also referred to as Buckby Lock Flight.

==History==
The Grand Junction Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 30 April 1793, and was to run over from Braunston on the Oxford Canal to Brentford near London, where it would join the River Thames. Construction of the northern section, which included the Whilton locks at Buckby, was complicated by the need for two tunnels, one to the north of the locks near Braunston, which was long, and the other to the south at Blisworth, which was long. Despite encountering quicksands in Braunston Tunnel, it was finished on 21 June 1796, and the canal opened to Weedon Bec, around to the south of the locks. Shortly afterwards, it was extended further south to Blisworth, but there were serious problems with Blisworth Tunnel, which had failed in January 1796. William Jessop was the engineer and wanted to abandon the idea of a tunnel. He proposed to build 29 locks to get beyond Blisworth, but was persuaded to try a different alignment by three engineers who were brought in to advise. Low level headings were cut to drain the main workings of water, and the tunnel opened on 25 March 1805, the last part of the canal to be completed. The Grand Junction Canal became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929, following amalgamation with the Regents Canal, the Warwick and Birmingham Canal and the Warwich and Napton Canal.
Below the bottom lock was a long level pound stretching to beyond Blisworth Tunnel. The seven locks raised the level of the canal by to a fairly short summit pound, which passed through Braunston Tunnel and then descended through five locks to Braunston. The locks were built wide enough to take two narrow boats side by side, in the hope that the canals beyond the northern terminus could be persuaded to widen their locks and that wide barges carrying 70 tons could be operated.

The locks at Buckby were all built with side ponds, to conserve water. These are maintained at an intermediate level between the upper and lower pound. When a lock is emptying, water from the top of the lock fills the side pond, and the rest is then discharged to the lower pound. When a lock is filling, the bottom of the lock is filled from the pond, and the rest is drawn from the upper pound. Typically, this system uses 40 per cent less water, but the ponds have been disused for a long time, and an electric pump is now used to pump water from the bottom of the flight to the top. The Grand Junction Canal experimented with side ponds from the early 1800s. The locks at Bourne End had several radial ponds, but use of the ponds was abandoned because it took too long to use the lock. Those at Buckby had two rectangular side ponds per lock, at different levels, and this design was eventually installed at most locks between Buckby and lock 45 at Bulbourne, the junction with the Wendover Arm.

==Location==
The locks are numbered from 7 at the top of the flight to 13 at the bottom. To the south of the flight is a long level pound, which stretches to the Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum and the top of the Stoke Bruerne flight of seven locks. Towards the southern end of this section is Blisworth Tunnel and Gayton Junction, where the Northampton Branch turns off to join the River Nene at Northampton. Just below the junction, the railway line from London to Rugby crosses the canal and then runs parallel to it. About below Whilton Locks, the M1 motorway approaches, and runs along the east bank, so that the bottom four locks are sandwiched between the railway and the motorway. The railway then crosses to the east bank, and the canal diverges to the west. Just before the final lock, the canal passes under Watling Street, once a Roman road and now part of the A5 road. The Leicester section of the Grand Union Canal then turns off at Norton Junction, and the canal continues on the level, passing through Braunston Tunnel to reach the top lock of the six that descend to Braunston, from the top of the Whilton flight.

The canal is above sea level at the top of the flight, and the locks drop the level by to . Whilton Marina is located close to the bottom lock. It was set up in 1971 in a field beside the canal, and now has 200 private moorings, while another 50 are occupied by boats which are for sale. The marina offers a full range of services. Between locks 7 and 8 there is an early nineteenth-century bridge, resting on stone supports. The piers and parapets are made of brick, and the structure is grade II listed. Beside lock 9 is a cast iron milepost, dating from the same period, indicating that it is to Braunston, which is also listed.

<doc id="1194361" wikidata="Q545153" url="?curid=1194361" title="Conon (crater)">
<text>Conon is a small but prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern foothills of the Montes Apenninus mountain range. The crater is named for the Greek astronomer Conon of Samos ( 250 BCE). Just to the west of Conon is the long mountainous ridge Mons Bradley. The nearest craters possessing an eponym are Galen, about to the east, and Aratus, about the same distance to the northeast.

==Description==
The edge of Conon&#x27;s rim is sharply defined and has not received significant erosion from later impacts. The inner wall is somewhat variable in width, and the interior floor forms an irregular oval shape. This irregularity may be due to the rough and uneven surface on which the crater was formed. The floor is rough, but lacks a central prominence of note.

To the south, in the Sinus Fidei, is a sinuous rille that follows a course to the south-southeast. This rille is designated Rima Conon, and is named after this crater.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Conon.

<text>Andrew James Matfin Bell (born 14 March 1986) is an English actor. He rose to prominence for his debut role in &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; (2000), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, becoming one of the youngest winners of the award. He is also known for his leading roles as Tintin in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011) and as Ben Grimm / Thing in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2015).

Other notable performances include in the films &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005), &quot;Jumper&quot; (2008), &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; (2013), &quot;Rocketman&quot; (2019), and &quot;All of Us Strangers&quot; (2023). He earned a second BAFTA Award nomination for his leading performance in &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot; (2017). In television, Bell starred as Abraham Woodhull in the AMC historical drama series &quot;&quot; (2014–2017).

==Early life==
Andrew James Matfin Bell was born on 14 March 1986 in Billingham, Teesside, England, where he grew up with his mother, Eileen Matfin and his elder sister Kathryn. His father, John Bell, a toolmaker, left before Jamie was born. Bell began his involvement with dancing after he accompanied his sister to her ballet lessons.

==Career==
===2000s===
In 1999, Bell was chosen from a field of over 2,000 boys for the role of Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old boy who dismays his working-class widowed father and elder brother by taking up ballet. Bell&#x27;s performance received widespread acclaim, and 14-year-old Bell won London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award for British Newcomer of the Year, British Independent Film Award for Best Newcomer, Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer, and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, becoming one of the youngest winners of the awards. His lack of an Oscar nomination was met with criticism. He also appeared in &quot;Close and True&quot;, an ITV legal drama shown in 2000, which starred Robson Green, James Bolam, Kerry Ann Christiansen and Susan Jameson.

Bell served as Honorary Jury President of the 2001 Giffoni Film Festival. In 2002, he appeared as the disabled servant Smike in an adaptation of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and a young soldier in &quot;Deathwatch&quot;. In the following years, he portrayed a teenager on the run in &quot;Undertow&quot;, a gun-toting pacifist in &quot;Dear Wendy&quot;, a disaffected Southern California teenager in &quot;The Chumscrubber&quot;, and the young Jimmy in the 2005 film version of &quot;King Kong&quot;. Also in 2005, he starred opposite Evan Rachel Wood in the Green Day video &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;, directed by Samuel Bayer. In 2007, he played the title character in &quot;Hallam Foe&quot; – for which he was nominated for the best actor award at the British Independent Film Awards – and appeared as himself in lonelygirl15 spin-off &quot;KateModern&quot;. He had roles in two 2008 films: the sci-fi film &quot;Jumper&quot; and the World War II drama &quot;Defiance&quot;. In the second film he plays Asael Bielski, the third of the Bielski Brothers, leaders of a partisan group that saved 1,200 lives during the Holocaust.

In 2009, producers announced that Bell would play the title role in the motion capture film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, alongside Andy Serkis and Daniel Craig. The film was released in 2011. 

===2010s===
Bell appeared in a number of films during the early 2010s, beginning with the 2011 films &quot;The Eagle&quot; as Esca and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; as St John Rivers. In 2013, he starred alongside James McAvoy in the film &quot;Filth&quot; and appeared as Edgar in &quot;Snowpiercer&quot;.

From 2014 to 2017, Bell appeared as Abraham Woodhull in &quot;&quot;. In 2015, he played the Thing in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; reboot. The film would go down in infamy as one of the worst comic book films ever made. In 2022, Bell would say of it, &quot;I don&#x27;t think [it deserves a second look.] Save your money, save your time.&quot;

In 2017, Bell had starring roles in &quot;6 Days&quot; and &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot;. The latter earned him a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In 2019, he had a supporting role as Bernie Taupin in the biographical musical film based on the life of Elton John, &quot;Rocketman&quot;.

In 2023, he appeared in the critically acclaimed movie &quot;All of Us Strangers&quot; as the protagonist&#x27;s father.

==Personal life==
Bell dated American actress Evan Rachel Wood for a year in 2005 after they had met at the Sundance Film Festival. Wood was aware of the false claims that they had first met while co-starring in the music video for Green Day&#x27;s song &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot; and has stated they were &quot;already dating and very much in love by that point.&quot; Five years later, in mid-2011, it was reported that Bell and Wood had rekindled their relationship. The couple married in a small ceremony in California on 30 October 2012. They have one son, born in July 2013. The couple announced that they had separated on 28 May 2014. 

Starting in 2020, Wood and Bell were in dispute over the custody of their son. Bell said he was deprived of contact with him when Wood moved from Los Angeles to Nashville; Wood claimed she did this to protect the child from former fiancé Marilyn Manson. Bell argued in court that Wood&#x27;s story defied credibility, and accused her of &quot;withholding our son from me for other reasons of her own invention.&quot; In May 2023, Wood accepted terms for their son staying in Los Angeles with Bell, while seeing him &quot;one extended weekend per month&quot; and holidays.

In late 2015, Bell began dating his &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; co-star Kate Mara, and in January 2017 the couple became engaged. On 17 July 2017 they announced that they had married. They have a daughter, born in May 2019. On 17 November 2022 his wife announced on her Instagram account that she had given birth to a son in the previous week.

Bell is an atheist. He is also a keen football fan and an avid supporter of Arsenal F.C.

<doc id="1194371" wikidata="Q7684276" url="?curid=1194371" title="Taoist diet">
<text>Taoist dietary practices are deeply rooted in the philosophical concepts of Yin-Yang, Qi (vital energy), and the pursuit of balance and harmony. While various schools of Taoism offer differing teachings, Taoist practitioners—particularly those in monastic and spiritual traditions—view diet as essential for maintaining physical, mental, and spiritual health. Central to these practices is the belief that food not only nourishes the body but also influences the flow of Qi, supporting the alignment of the practitioner with the natural rhythms of the Dao (the Way). Taoist diet emphasizes simplicity, frugality, and moderation, advocating for natural, minimally processed foods that help cultivate balance. By avoiding excess, practitioners seek to maintain harmony between internal and external forces, promoting longevity, clarity, and spiritual cultivation.

== Philosophical Foundations ==
Taoist dietary practices are deeply rooted in the philosophical principles of Taoism as expressed in foundational texts such as the Dao De Jing, the Zhuangzi, and the I-Ching. These works emphasize the importance of aligning with the Dao (the Way), maintaining simplicity, and achieving balance in all aspects of life, including diet.

=== Harmony with the Dao ===
The &quot;Dao De Jing&quot; emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with the natural world as a cornerstone of well-being. Chapter 8, for instance, compares the Dao to water, which effortlessly nourishes all things without contention. This concept inspires Taoists to adopt dietary practices that align with the natural flow of life, prioritizing natural and minimally processed foods. As stated in Chapter 8:

&quot;The highest goodness is like water. Water easily benefits all things without struggle. Yet it abides in places that men hate. Therefore it is like the Way&quot; (Laozi, 1991).

Similarly, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; illustrates this harmony with the story of Cook Ding, a butcher whose mastery lies in his ability to work in alignment with the natural rhythms of life. This story serves as a metaphor for approaching all aspects of life, including dietary choices, with mindfulness and respect for nature’s inherent order:

&quot;Now I practise with my mind, not with my eyes. I ignore my sense and follow my spirit. I see the natural lines and my knife slides through the great hollows, follows the great cavities, using that which is already there to my advantage&quot; (Zhuangzi, 2006).

These teachings collectively underscore a Taoist approach to diet that values simplicity, balance, and respect for the natural world.

=== Simplicity and Non-Excess ===
The &quot;Dao De Jing&quot; emphasizes the importance of simplicity and restraint in all aspects of life, warning against overstimulation of the senses and excessive indulgence.

&quot;&quot;The five colors blind the eye.&quot;

&quot;The five tones deafen the ear.&quot;

&quot;The five flavors confuse the palate.&quot;

&quot;Racing and hunting madden the mind.&quot;

&quot;Possessing rare treasures brings about harmful behavior.&quot;

&quot;Therefore, the sage acts from within and not from the senses.&quot;&quot;

This teaching reflects the Taoist ideal of avoiding excess and finding harmony through moderation. In the context of diet, it encourages the consumption of simple, natural foods while avoiding overly rich, processed, or highly spiced items that could overwhelm the senses and disturb inner balance. By prioritizing simplicity, Taoists seek to cultivate mental clarity, spiritual focus, and alignment with the natural order of the Dao.

The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; introduces the concept of &quot;xinzhai&quot; or &quot;fasting of the heart,&quot; a practice of emptying the mind and relinquishing desires. In this state, one is open and receptive to Dao (pag. 231). This spiritual fasting emphasizes inner clarity over external distractions:

&quot;Your mind must become one; do not try to understand with your ears but with your heart. Indeed, not with your heart but with your soul. Listening blocks the ears, set your heart on what is right, but let your soul be open to receive in true sincerity. The Way is found in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the heart&quot; (Zhuangzi, 2006, Chapter 4).

As Littlejohn (2019) explains in the &quot;Historical Dictionary of Daoism&quot;: &quot;Yan Hui mistakenly takes this to mean he should avoid eating. Confucius tells him that &quot;xinzhai&quot;, or &#x27;fasting of the heart-mind,&#x27; does not have to do with what one eats but with emptying the mind of thoughts and distinctions so that one’s &quot;qi&quot; can unite with the Dao.&quot; (pag. 116)

In the context of diet, this teaching extends to the principle of simplicity and moderation. Just as spiritual growth requires detachment from excess thoughts, dietary choices should reflect balance and avoid indulgence. Taoists view mindful eating as a way to foster both physical and spiritual well-being, aligning with the rhythms of nature and the Dao.

=== Yin-Yang Balance ===
The concept of Yin-Yang emphasizes the harmony of complementary forces, which is fundamental to maintaining health and well-being. This balance extends to nourishment, as described in Hexagram 27 of the &quot;I Ching&quot;, known as &quot;Nourishment.&quot; This hexagram highlights the importance of mindful consumption—not only of food but also of ideas, influences, and teachings. It underscores the Taoist ideal of moderation and simplicity in all aspects of life:

&quot;Nourishing. Righteous persistence brings good fortune. Watch people nourishing others and observe with what manner of things they seek to nourish themselves&quot; (Wilhelm &amp; Baynes, 1967, Hexagram 27).

The text also connects nourishment to moral discipline, encouraging thoughtful behavior. According to Blofeld (1968), the symbology of this hexagram expresses: “&quot;The Superior Man is thoughtful in speech and frugal in his eating and drinking.&quot;”

In Taoism, achieving balance in one’s diet reflects a broader effort to harmonize internal and external forces, aligning the body and spirit with the rhythms of nature.

=== Frugality as a Virtue ===
Frugality is a central virtue in Daoist teachings, emphasizing the importance of simplicity and balance in all aspects of life, including nourishment. The &quot;Dao De Jing&quot; repeatedly advocates for avoiding excess and embracing modesty:

“&quot;To hold until full is not as good as stopping.&quot;

&quot;An oversharpened sword cannot last long.&quot;

&quot;A room filled with gold and jewels cannot be protected.&quot;

&quot;Boasting of wealth and virtue brings your demise.&quot;

&quot;After finishing the work, withdraw.&quot;

&quot;This is the Way of Heaven&quot;” (Chapter 9)

In Chapter 67, Laozi describes frugality as one of the three essential treasures:

&quot;I have three treasures that I hold and cherish. The first is compassion, the second is frugality, and the third is not daring to put myself ahead of others.&quot;

Further, in Chapter 59, frugality is linked to good governance and spiritual growth:

&quot;In governing the country and serving Heaven, there is nothing like frugality. Only by being frugal can you recover quickly. When you recover quickly, you accumulate virtue. Having accumulated virtue, there is nothing you can&#x27;t overcome&quot; 

By advocating frugality, Daoism promotes a way of life that is sustainable, virtuous, and harmonious with the natural order, encouraging individuals to avoid indulgence and to focus on what truly nourishes the body and spirit.

=== Qi and purity ===
Taoist dietary practices emphasize the cultivation and preservation of qi (vital energy), a cornerstone of physical and spiritual well-being. Grains, while staples in many diets, were believed in Taoist tradition to disrupt the flow of qi. As Littlejohn (2019) explains: &quot;In Daoist practice, grains were believed to be the source of such harmful entities as &#x27;corpses&#x27; (sanshi) or &#x27;worms&#x27; (jiuchong) residing in the intestine and the brain&quot; (p. 15).

The Taoist practice of &quot;bigu&quot; (grain avoidance) emerged as a method of preserving purity and enhancing longevity. The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; highlights the dangers of grains in the Verse of Great Existence:

“&quot;The five grains are chisels cutting life away,&quot;

&quot;Making the five organs stink and shorten our spans.&quot;

&quot;Once entered into our stomach,&quot;

&quot;There’s no more chance to live quite long.&quot;

&quot;To strive for complete avoidance of all death,&quot;

&quot;Keep your intestines free of excrement!&quot;” (Zhuangzi, 1994)

In Taoist mythology, abstaining from grains was linked to mystical practices and spiritual refinement. One passage describes a transcendent being who nourishes themselves not with food but with the elements:

“&quot;He does not eat any of the five grains but inhales the wind and drinks the dew&quot;” (Zhuangzi, 1994).

By avoiding grains, practitioners aimed to purify their bodies, cultivate their qi, and align with natural rhythms. This approach reflects the Taoist ideal of minimizing external influences that disrupt the balance of life, fostering harmony with the Dao and longevity.

==Fasting==

Some early Taoist diets called for &quot;bigu&quot; (), based on the belief that immortality could be achieved in this way. The ancient Taoist texts of the &quot;Taiping Jing&quot; suggest that individuals who attained the state of complete ziran would not need food at all, but instead could sustain themselves by absorbing the cosmic qi.

==Vegetarianism==

Taoist religious orders often promote a vegetarian diet in order to minimize harm to other sentient life. Taoist levels of dietary restriction, however, are varied.

In legend, Han dynasty prince and Taoist adept Liú Ān is credited for inventing the vegetarian food tofu.

==Contemporary Taoism==

According to Ming Yi Wang, one version of the taoist diet includes bigu, veganism, as well as refraining from eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally asafoetida, shallot, mountain leek, and &quot;Allium chinense&quot; or other alliums, which together with garlic are referred to as &quot;wǔ hūn&quot; (五葷, or &#x27;Five Fetid and Strong-smelling Vegetables&#x27;). Additionally, nightshades are avoided.

<text>The Calder Valley line (also previously known as the Caldervale line) is a railway route in Northern England between the cities of Leeds and Manchester as well as the seaside resort of Blackpool. It is the slower of the two main rail routes between Leeds and Manchester (the other being the Huddersfield line), and the northernmost of the three main trans-Pennine routes.

==Services==

Passenger train services are operated by Northern and run on the following pattern:

* Bradford Interchange–Halifax– (Class 150 and occasionally Class 158 )
* Leeds––Manchester Victoria–Wigan Wallgate (Class 158 and occasionally Class 195 &quot;Civity&quot;)
* Leeds–Halifax–Manchester Victoria– (Class 195 &quot;Civity&quot;)
* York–Leeds–Halifax–Preston–Blackpool North (Class 195 &quot;Civity&quot;)
* –Burnley––Manchester Victoria (Class 150 or 156)
* –Bradford Interchange–Leeds–Hull (Class 158)

This line, along with the Huddersfield line and York and Selby lines, was in the past combined in national timetables to show a coast-to-coast service but since May 2018 has been split again into separate routes for operational reasons and to improve service reliability. Through running to Chester (with a limited peak provision to via Helsby) began in May 2019.

Services within West Yorkshire are sponsored by West Yorkshire Metro, whose tickets (including Metrocards) can be used up to Hebden Bridge between Leeds and Blackpool, and Walsden between Leeds and Manchester.

==Route==

Before the 1923 Grouping the first section of the line (Leeds–Bradford) was owned by the Great Northern Railway (GNR); and the entire remainder by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR), apart from the final section of the branch leading into Huddersfield, which was owned by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR).

For the section between Halifax and Burnley the line uses the valley of the River Calder, which in fact comprises two separate valleys with rivers of the same name, that of West Yorkshire and the Lancashire River Calder thus giving the services their name; it also follows the Rochdale Canal from Todmorden into Manchester. Since the route crosses the Pennines, there are many tunnels to negotiate &quot;en route&quot;.

The British Railways Board&#x27;s Corporate Plan for 1983–1988 marked the routes between Milner Royd Junction (east of Sowerby Bridge) and Bowling Junction (south of Bradford Interchange); and Milner Royd Junction and Heaton Lodge Junction (west of Mirfield) to be &#x27;singled&#x27; on a list &quot;The Proposed Elimination of Non-Essential Multiple Tracks&quot;. A combination of factors meant this was never implemented: the better gradients for freight than the Huddersfield trans-Pennine route; and the mid-1980s uncertainty over the Settle-Carlisle route meant that this became the preferred route for goods between Leeds and Preston/Carlisle.

Today, Hebden Bridge and Leeds are the only stations where every service calls, the route description follows.

===Leeds–Bradford===
For the initial section of the route between Leeds and Bradford, see Leeds–Bradford lines.

===Bradford–Halifax===
Many stations on this route have been closed. Stations currently open are in bold. Original places served, and notes on the route:
* Bowling was named &quot;Bowling Junction&quot; for its link with the GNR at this point
* here is &quot;Bowling Tunnel&quot; 1648 yd (1483m)
* Low Moor, also a junction with GNR. Closed in 1965 and reopened in April 2017.
* here was a triangular junction for the L&amp;YR line to Dewsbury
* here are two tunnels: &quot;New Furnace Tunnel&quot; and &quot;Wyke Tunnel&quot;
* Wyke and Norwood Green
* here is Pickle Bridge junction for the Pickle Bridge Line to Huddersfield: now closed, there were two stations, Bailiff Bridge and Clifton Road
* Lightcliffe
* here is &quot;Lightcliffe Tunnel&quot;
* Hipperholme
* here is &quot;Beacon Hill Tunnel&quot; 1105 yd (995m)
* Halifax

On 24 October 1901, as the 6.10 pm down goods train from Low Moor to Leeds to was passing through Bowling Tunnel, the rear section broke loose. It came to a stop in the tunnel and was run into from behind by the 9.05 pm goods train from Low Moor to Laisterdyke. Wreckage partly blocking the up line was then hit by the 9:00 pm passenger train from Leeds to Manchester. Nobody was killed but there was extensive damage to rolling stock.

===Halifax–Huddersfield===
This route was re-opened to passengers in 2000 when Brighouse station was re-opened, and two short lengths of line were relaid (after being out of use for 15 years) to enable trains to reach Huddersfield.
* At Dryclough Junction the Huddersfield route leaves the main line.
* Greetland station closed in 1962.
* Elland station closed in 1962 but is expected to reopen in 2025
* Brighouse
* Bradley station closed in 1950,
* Deighton is only used by trains on the Huddersfield line; Calder Valley line trains do not call there.
* Huddersfield

===Halifax–Manchester Oxford Road===
Many stations on this route have been closed (or are not served by the Calder Valley line trains): original stations served:
* here was the triangular junction for the line via Mirfield to Dewsbury; Brighouse station is on this line.
* here is &quot;Bank House Tunnel&quot;
* here was Copley station
* the line now turns west into the Calder valley, joining the original 1840 main line at &quot;Milner Royd Junction&quot;.
* Sowerby Bridge
* at Sowerby Bridge heading west the line used to branch off to Ripponden. It was originally intended to continue to Littleborough but ended at Rishworth. Closed to passengers 8 July 1929.
* here was Luddendenfoot railway station now closed
* Mytholmroyd
* here is &quot;Mytholmroyd Railway Viaduct&quot;
* Hebden Bridge
* (all Calder Valley Line services serve Hebden Bridge)
* here is &quot;Weasel Hall Tunnel&quot;
* here was Eastwood station
* here are: &quot;Castle Hill Tunnel&quot;; &quot;Horsfall Tunnel&quot;; and &quot;Millwood Tunnel&quot;
* &quot; Hall Royd Junction&quot;: here the trains on the Blackpool service turn northwestward, following the Calder Valley (see below)
* Todmorden here the line takes a southward direction, in the same valley as the Rochdale Canal
* Walsden 
* after &quot;Winterbutlee Tunnel&quot; follows &quot;Summit Tunnel&quot;, at 2885 yd (2597 m) the longest on the L&amp;YR lines. Here the line crosses into the Rochdale District of Greater Manchester
* Littleborough
* Smithy Bridge
* Rochdale: junction for two lines: to Bacup (closed to passengers 16 June 1947) and to Oldham
* Castleton: junction for a line to Bury
* Mills Hill
* Middleton Junction junction for two lines: Middleton branch; and Oldham (both closed)
* Moston
* Newton Heath
* Miles Platting
* Manchester Victoria
* The train passes Salford Central railway station on the formerly L&amp;MR line before traversing the Ordsall Chord to join the formerly CLC line.
* Deansgate
* Manchester Oxford Road

On 28 February 1902 a Wakefield to Rose Grove goods train broke into two due to a broken coupling, resulting in the rear half eventually crashing at high speed into the front half in Millwood Tunnel. No one was killed but wreckage filled the tunnel right up to the roof.

Summit Tunnel was the scene of a major fire in 1984, caused when a freight train hauling petrol tankers derailed.

===Blackpool route===
Trains continue up the Calder valley to Burnley and Blackburn; it also runs parallel with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal from Burnley. The section from Todmorden to Burnley (often called the Copy Pit line) was opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway (later L&amp;YR) on 12 November 1849. The East Lancashire Railway (later L&amp;YR) built the Burnley to Preston line, Burnley to Accrington 18 September 1848, Accrington to Blackburn 19 June 1848, and the Blackburn to Preston section on 1 June 1846.

The Rose Grove–Todmorden (Hall Royd) local service over this route ended in 1965, the only passenger services thereafter being a daily Leeds–Blackpool train. In mid-1982 the last tanker train travelled over the line, with the expectation of closure shortly after. A turning point came when the National and Provincial Building Society moved staff from Burnley to Bradford. The Society arranged for a Preston–Bradford Interchange train to be run to move staff from their home base to Bradford offices. In October 1984 British Rail developed this into five trains each way between Leeds and Preston with one extended to Blackpool.

====Todmorden curve====
The Todmorden curve is a section of track at Hall Royd Junction in Todmorden which was lifted in 1972. Originally Hall Royd Junction was triangular, and the lifted curve allowed services from Burnley to reach Manchester via Todmorden (regular services over it had ceased in November 1965). Reinstating the curve was a priority for Lancashire County Council and was ranked as the most important project in its 2010 Rail Improvement Schemes draft report. The government stated in March 2010 that reinstating the link would cost around £7 million and any new rail services would require initial subsidy. Burnley MP Kitty Ussher wrote to the North West Development Agency to seek assurance that it could find the money. In October 2010 Network Rail agreed to pay for the final assessment of the plans. This assessment, completed in May 2011, concluded that it could be feasible to reinstate the curve, although the original route could not be used as the original curve was deemed to be too sharp. An alternative route was instead put forward, and it was stated that, if funds could be obtained by early 2012 to carry forward the project, the curve could be back in use by the end of 2013.

On 31 October 2011, the deputy Prime Minister announced that the scheme would be given the go-ahead.

Construction work began in summer 2013, and the curve was planned to be available for the May 2014 timetable change. The track was completed and tested in May 2014, and services began on 17 May 2015.

====Original stations====
Many stations on this route have been closed (or are not served by the Calder Valley line trains): original stations served and other notes on the route:
* &quot;Hall Royd Junction&quot;: see above; there are now no stations on the route before Burnley; stations once served, and notes on the route:

* Blackburn: junction of the line to Bolton
* Mill Hill
* Cherry Tree
* here was the L&amp;YR/LNWR joint line (the &quot;Lancashire Union Joint Railway&quot;) to Chorley and the West Coast Route (opened 1 November 1869 and closed to passengers 4 January 1960)
* Pleasington
* Hoghton
* Bamber Bridge
* here was a junction for a direct route to Preston, the surviving route continues to Preston via Lostock Hall where there are further junctions, including one for the former through route to Liverpool.

===Preston to Blackpool===
This route is described in more detail in Blackpool branch lines.
* Preston: the joint LNWR/L&amp;YR station on the West Coast Route
* Lea Road
* Salwick
* Kirkham and Wesham
* here were junctions: for the direct route to Blackpool; and the coast route via Lytham St Annes on Sea
* Singleton
* Poulton-le-Fylde
* here was the junction for Fleetwood (line closed to passengers 1 June 1970)
* Layton (opened as Bispham)
* Blackpool North was named &quot;Talbot Road&quot;

===Holme Tunnel engineering work===
Holme Tunnel, which lies between Hebden Bridge and Burnley Manchester Road, was closed for 20 weeks from November 2013 until March 2014. This was to allow for major engineering work to fix the distorted shape of the tunnel, caused by movement of the ground through which it passes. The project was budgeted to cost £16.3 million. During the works, buses replaced train services. Trains can now pass through at 45 mph.

==Future==
Improvements to the line were proposed as part of Network Rail&#x27;s 2010 Northern Hub plans, which would allow for more frequent services on the line. Some services via Bradford would also be extended to , , Liverpool and . The Chester services started in December 2017 under the proposed &quot;Northern Connect&quot; brand, which has since been scrapped. Those services are operated by new 100 mph Class 195 diesel trains by December 2019. In 2018, the Manchester Airport trains briefly ran over the Ordsall Curve. However, those services have also been scrapped. Track and signalling upgrades between Hebden Bridge and Leeds (following on from work already carried out between Littleborough and Manchester) will allow for quicker journey times by the autumn of 2018. The work will see four existing signal boxes between Hebden Bridge and Mill Lane Junction in Bradford closed and signalling control transferred to the Rail Operating Centre at York. The ROC will also take over the operation of the parts of the line through Brighouse and Mirfield currently controlled from Huddersfield and Healey Mills panel boxes.

 station, between Bradford Interchange and Halifax, reopened on 2 April 2017 after the original opening planned for 2005 was delayed by the discovery of disused mine workings under the station site. A business case is being developed to re-open station between Halifax and Brighouse.

Calderdale Council have called for the route to be electrified as an alternative route to the line through Huddersfield should that be closed for engineering works. Tim Swift, the leader of Calderdale Council in 2015 stated &quot;It makes no logical sense in terms of a long term network to electrify the Trans-Pennine Route and not the Calder Valley Line&quot;. In March 2015 The Northern Sparks report was produced by a committee of Members of Parliament from all parties focusing on economic benefits of electrification in the North. The Calder Valley line in its entirety was number one priority. This was reiterated in 2018.

The Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands (IRP) is a government document that was published on 18 November 2021. This document says that the line from Leeds to Bradford Interchange will be electrified.

As part of the TFGM&#x27;s Delivery Plan, there are plans to electrify the line between Manchester Victoria to Rochdale via Mills Hill. This is part of the 2040 Strategy, and they aim to complete business cases for the early start of it with potential completion in 2026, subject to funding.

<doc id="1194373" wikidata="Q743285" url="?curid=1194373" title="Whilton">
<text>Whilton is a village and a civil parish in the English county of Northamptonshire. The population (including Slapton) at the 2011 Census was 271. The village is in West Northamptonshire. Whilton is northwest of London, west of Northampton and southeast of Rugby. The village lies east of the nearest town of Daventry. The nearest railway station is at Long Buckby for the Northampton loop of the West Coast Main Line which runs between Rugby, Northampton and London. The nearest airport is Birmingham Airport. Whilton gives its name to the nearby Whilton Locks and Whilton Marina on the Grand Union Canal. Whilton is also home to the world famous Whilton Mill Kart Circuit, where many drivers like Jack Wilch (WMKC B Final runner up) and Spencer Brougham (Electric Kart European championship winner) started their careers. Whilton Mill Kart Circuit is run by chief Marshal Harry Bonham

==History==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Wheel farm/settlement&#x27;, either alluding to the circular hill on which the village stands or the bending course of the stream here.

Whilton is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1068, where it is listed under the name of &#x27;Woltone&#x27;. The main tenant landowner was Robert, Count of Mortain who was the half-brother to William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy and later king William I of England.

Whilton gives its name to a book described as a Social-Legal Study of Dispute Settlement in Medieval England, called &#x27;The Whilton Dispute, 1264 to 1380&#x27;, written by Robert C Palmer, in which the Whelton family was engaged. The Mortimer &amp; Montgomery families were also involved.

==The Parish Church of Saint Andrew==
The Parish Church of Saint Andrew is constructed from the local Northamptonshire Ironstone and was built between the 12th and 13th centuries, although very little remains of this original, having been restored in late 18th century. The tower had a ring of 6 bells, which had been given in 1777 by the patron of the time William Lucas Rose, who also paid for their installation and the building work. Three of these original bells and three newer replacements were recast and, with added metal, were made into a ring of eight bells in 1994. They were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The tenor (heaviest) bell weighs and bears the inscription: CANON J.J. RICHARDSON, PRIEST /HAROLD HAYNES, JANET C. BOWERS CHURCHWARDENS /WHITECHAPEL 1994. The church clock is unusual as it was originally a one handed clock divided into ¼ hours and therefore does not have 60 minutes. In 1779 William Lucas Rose also gave a gift of communion vessels which are still in use today. The Church&#x27;s east window, the only stained glass in the building, portrays the crucifixion of Jesus and dates from 1878.

==Amenities==
The nearby Whilton Marina is close to Whilton Locks on the Grand Union canal. It was dug out in 1971 by the Steele family who still own and operate the business. The marina has over 200 moorings. The village also has a karting track nearby called Whilton Mill.

<doc id="1194374" wikidata="Q2363544" url="?curid=1194374" title="Keiki">
<text>In horticulture, a keiki ( ) is a plant produced asexually by an orchid plant, especially &quot;Dendrobium&quot;, &quot;Epidendrum&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), and &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; orchids. The baby plant is an exact clone of the mother plant, sometimes flowering while still attached to the mother. The word is Hawaiian for &#x27;baby&#x27; or &#x27;child&#x27;, literally meaning &#x27;the little one&#x27;.

On a &quot;Phalaenopsis,&quot; a keiki is a small plant growing from one node along the flower stem. Keiki growth may be induced by prolonged exposure to high temperatures during the final phase of spike growth. On a &quot;Dendrobium,&quot; the keiki is typically found sprouting along the length of the cane or from the end of the cane.

In addition to keikis which grow on flower spikes, &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; may occasionally produce basal keikis at the base of the orchid.

== Removing keikis ==

If a new plant is desired, the keiki should be left on the mother plant until it develops a healthy root system at least long and has two or three leaves (for a &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot;) or canes (&quot;Dendrobium&quot;). For a &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; keiki, this may take 6–12 months from when the keiki first forms. At this point, it can be carefully removed with a sharp knife and planted in its own pot. Keikis are cut below and above the stem, leaving a small piece of stem on the baby plant.

Some species orchids like &quot;Phalaenopsis pulchra&quot; frequently produce keikis, which flower while still attached to the mother plant.

If a new plant is not desired, the keiki can be removed at any time. Removing the entire inflorescence after flowering is complete can prevent the production of keikis and result in a &quot;tidier&quot; appearance for the plant.

== Hormone paste ==
Keiki paste is a cytokinin hormone which induces growth in the node of a &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; inflorescence. It should not be confused with paste or powder containing auxins, which are used to force the production of roots.

Nodes on &quot;Phalaenopsis&quot; spikes will form either vegetative growth (keiki) or floral growth (a branch with flower buds). If the node tissue is already differentiated so that it will become a floral branch, there is no way to change the result; therefore, the paste must be applied to the node before it is differentiated. However, there is no way to predict if an undifferentiated node will become a keiki or a floral branch.

<doc id="1194383" wikidata="Q2910384" url="?curid=1194383" title="Noozles">
<text>, also known as The Wondrous Koala Blinky, is a 26-episode anime by Nippon Animation Company that was originally released in Japan in 1984. It depicts the adventures of a 12-year-old girl named Sandy and her koala friends, Blinky and Pinky, who are from the extra-dimensional realm of Koalawalla Land.

&quot;Noozles&quot; aired in Japan on Fuji TV in Tokyo and affiliated stations in its original run from July to December 1984. An edited, dubbed version later aired in the United States on Nick Jr. from November 1988 to April 1993. The show usually aired at 1 P.M. on the weekdays, immediately following another koala-themed anime, &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot;, and in the UK on BBC, later on The Children&#x27;s Channel.

The series has also been dubbed into French (under the title &quot;Les Koalous&quot;), Korean, Spanish (under the title &quot;Sandy y sus koalas&quot;), Arabic and German.

The series features episode direction by Noboru Ishiguro, best known for his work on the sci-fi anime series &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (&quot;Star Blazers&quot;) and the original &quot;Macross&quot; series (which became part of &quot;Robotech&quot; in North America) and layout work by Yasuji Mori. Mori also worked on the series&#x27; original character designs with Shuichi Seki, but the final designs were done by Isamu Kumata.

==Plot==
One day, 12-year-old Sandy Brown receives a package from her long-lost grandfather containing a stuffed Koala named Blinky that was lost in a shipwreck 38 years ago. Sandy gives the koala a Noozle and it revives him from &quot;magic sleepytime&quot;. His first word is &quot;Blinky!!&quot; in response to Sandy thinking out loud what she should name the bear right before she awakens him. They are soon joined by Blinky&#x27;s sister Pinky, who appears out of thin air soon after Blinky is awakened, and demands immediately that Blinky returns with her to KoalaWalla Land. Blinky refuses however, and the trio go on to have many adventures together. Blinky is able to sustain himself while living on Earth with Sandy because of the Eucalyptus trees that Sandy&#x27;s grandmother had planted 38 years ago when Sandy&#x27;s grandfather, an archaeologist who had mysteriously disappeared while on an expedition to Ayers Rock, just before the ship was lost, told her that he was sending a Koala as a gift, as Sandy&#x27;s grandmother had expressed that she had always wanted one as a pet.

It takes Sandy some time to determine that the &quot;noozle&quot; is the action that revives Blinky from magic sleepytime. She does this several times without thinking about it, and gets frustrated over the fact that Blinky falls asleep repeatedly (during which time his appearance is similar to that of an ordinary stuffed animal) and stubbornly refuses to awaken until she realizes what she must do to revive him. Early in the series, Sandy decides to introduce Blinky and Pinky to her grandmother, but decides to keep them a secret to everyone else.

About halfway through the series, Blinky and Pinky bring Sandy to their homeworld of KoalaWalla Land. KoalaWalla Land is a parallel dimension inhabited by anthropomorphic koalas, kangaroos, platypuses, cassowaries, kiwi, and frill-necked lizards. It is ruled by a wise old koala known as the High Dingy Doo. Humans aren&#x27;t allowed in KoalaWalla Land (and in fact a human will be arrested and jailed on sight just for being in KoalaWalla Land), so Sandy has to wear a koala mask during each visit (though some are able to see through her poor disguise). A portal to KoalaWalla Land can be found at Ayers Rock. Pinkie also has the ability to create instant portals to KoalaWalla Land at any point, as well as portals back and forth through time, by utilizing the red lipstick in her magic cosmetic kit to draw an interdimensional hole in the time-space continuum.

Meanwhile, Sandy&#x27;s father Alex, who is also an archaeologist like his father before him, is exploring Ayers Rock and trying to solve the mystery of what happened to his father 38 years ago. While there, he discovers a cave, and on the wall of the cave is a message that his father wrote 38 years ago, saying &quot;I must leave on a mission of great importance. The little koala will know where I&#x27;ll be.&quot; Alex stumbles into the portal to KoalaWalla Land at the end of the tunnel, where he is chased by the KoalaWalla Land police. Sandy, Blinky, and Pinky travel to KoalaWalla Land to rescue him. Alex stumbles upon a crystal planetoid in KoalaWalla Land, where he sees a shadowy figure resembling his father in one of the crystals. There, the KoalaWalla Land police find him and place him under a sleeping spell, but Sandy and Blinky and Pinky arrive to rescue him. They bring him back to Ayers Rock. Alex wakes up, convinced that the entire experience was a dream.

When Sandy hears that her father saw her grandfather, she and Blinky and Pinky decide to go back to KoalaWalla Land to look for him. They decide to look in The Crystal Place, which is connected to the crystal planetoid where Alex saw his father. The Crystal Place, which lies at the very core of KoalaWalla Land and helps hold the universe together, is a giant crystalline sphere filled with brightly colored orbs, which when touched by bare hands immediately entrap that person&#x27;s essence forever with no escape. Sandy, protected by Pinky&#x27;s magic bubble, enters The Crystal Place, and finds the spirit of her grandfather imprisoned in one of the orbs, trapped in a limbo-like state. He tells her to learn from the creatures of KoalaWalla Land and to understand how their community has come to survive in a world of love and companionship. Finally, he delivers the cryptic message &quot;as the world of KoalaWalla Land goes, so goes the world of mankind.&quot; Sandy wants to know what he means, but that&#x27;s all he can tell her, and he tells her that more will be revealed in due time.

Some time later, Alex is exploring Africa. He is scheduled to return home, but when he hears the story of a magic stone called the &quot;wiseman stone&quot;, he decides to stay in Africa to search for it. Sandy and her mother are disappointed when they hear that Alex is staying in Africa, so Blinky and Pinky travel there to try to find a way to convince him to come home. They attempt to scare him back home by making ghost noises, and even create illusionary dinosaurs in an attempt to scare him away from the dig site, but nothing seems to work. Finally, Sandy&#x27;s grandmother appears. She has traveled to Africa to scold her son for running off to look for the wiseman stone when his wife and daughter are waiting for him to come home. Alex decides to come back home with his mother. Shortly after arriving back home, Alex receives a phone call from his assistant Lionel who says that his team has found what they believe to be the Wiseman Stone, but they need Alex to check if it&#x27;s the real deal since he&#x27;s the expert on the subject. Later, during a visit to Sandy&#x27;s grandmothers house, Blinky uses his magic powers to teleport an unknowing Alex to Africa. Confused as to how he got there, Alex checks the stone and confirms that it&#x27;s authentic. Alex still has the stone with him when Blinky transports him back. Alex is still confused about the whole thing. When he shows the stone to his mother, she tells him that he must have found the stone in her attic, and that it is a stone that his father had found many years ago. After Sandy and her Parents have gone home, her grandmother brings the stone up to her attic, and it is revealed that there are two wiseman stones, one that Alex found in Africa, and another that his father had found years before.

One day, during another trip to Sandy&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s house, Alex finds the two Wiseman stones in her attic. Alex is confused as to why there is now a second wiseman stone. His mother tells him that his father found one, and that he put the other one there when he came back from Africa. It is then that Sandy decides to tell her parents the truth about Blinky and Pinky. Shortly afterward, they receive a surprise visit from the High Dingy Doo, who has come to ask Alex a very important favor. The High Dingy explains that KoallaWalla Land and the Earth are destined to one day separate from each other naturally. However, because of Seismic Testing in the Australian Outback, the inter-dimensional axis that binds the two worlds together has become severely weakened, speeding up the process so much that both worlds could be destroyed in the separation. The High Dingy Doo also explains that Sandy&#x27;s grandfather knew that this would happen someday due to his research of ancient Australian folklore. He entered The Crystal Place and became trapped there while trying to unravel the secrets of KoalaWalla Land. The High Dingy Doo says that Sandy&#x27;s grandfather likely knows how to save the worlds from destruction, but that his spirit can only communicate with someone who is related to him by blood. The High Dingy Doo asks Alex to come to The Crystal Place so he can speak to his father&#x27;s Spirit. Alex, protected by a magic bubble created by the High Dingy Doo, enters The Crystal Place and tells his father&#x27;s spirit of the impending disaster. His father tells him that the only way to restore the balance between the two worlds so they can separate safely is to give the wiseman stones to Blinky, who will know what to do from there. After returning to earth, Alex gives the wiseman stones to Blinky, who now remembers what it is that he must do. Blinky teleports himself, Pinky, Sandy, her parents, and her grandmother to Ayers Rock, where the separation has already begun. Blinky and Pinky bring the stones to the top of Ayers Rock and place them in a predisposed altar, where Blinky manipulates them in a joystick-like fashion to keep the two worlds from destroying each other. Blinky and Pinky return to KoalaWalla Land in the process. Because the two worlds now exist as completely separate dimensions, Pinky&#x27;s magic is no longer able to bridge the ties that formerly bound them, meaning Blinky and Pinky must now forever remain in their home separate from Earth.

==Historical background==
&quot;Noozles&quot; was made as Japan was in the midst of a koala frenzy along with another koala themed anime titled コアラボーイコッキィ (&quot;Koala Boy Kokki&quot;), which would later be broadcast alongside &quot;Noozles&quot; on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block in 1988, under the English title &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot;. According to &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia&quot; by Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, Japan&#x27;s koala frenzy was sparked by the Tama Zoo in western Tokyo receiving their first koala as the Australian government sent six koalas to Japan as a token of goodwill, but in actuality, the Tama Zoo as well as other zoos in Japan got their koalas because Japan was craving them.

&quot;Noozles&quot; aired on Fuji TV in the Kanto region of Japan Saturday nights at 8pm from July through September 1984, then moved to Fridays at 7pm for the remainder of the series run. Some other stations in the Fuji network system, namely Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting, TV Shizuoka, Fukui TV, Tokai TV, Okayama Broadcasting and San-in Chūō Television Broadcasting, aired the series in the same time slots as the producing station; other stations in the chain aired it on a delayed basis.

<doc id="1194385" wikidata="Q6266699" url="?curid=1194385" title="Johnny Franz">
<text>John Charles Franz (23 February 1922 – 29 January 1977) was an English record producer and A&amp;R man at the Philips label. He was one of Britain&#x27;s most successful producers in the 1950s and 1960s. While his recordings encompassed several forms of mainstream popular music, his most enduring contributions were to British pop music of the mid-1960s on records by Dusty Springfield, The Walker Brothers, and the early solo recordings of Scott Walker. From 1973, he was responsible for the production of Peters &amp; Lee recordings, which included their No. 1 chart hit &quot;Welcome Home&quot;.

==Career==
Franz was born in Holloway, London, England, and learned piano before joining the music publishers Francis, Day &amp; Hunter as an office boy in Denmark Street, the British equivalent of Tin Pan Alley. He also worked as a club pianist in dance bands, and appeared on radio with harmonica player Ronald Chesney. By the late 1940s, he was regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s top accompanists for singers such as Anne Shelton.

He also worked as a BBC orchestrator before becoming the head of A&amp;R at Philips Records in 1954. Franz went on to produce many prolific British artists for the label, including Dame Shirley Bassey, the Beverley Sisters, Frankie Vaughan, Robert Earl, Susan Maughan, Marty Wilde, Ronnie Carroll, Sir Harry Secombe, Winifred Atwell, The Springfields, The Four Pennies, Julie Rogers, Peters and Lee, Dusty Springfield, Anne Shelton, and the Walker Brothers in the 1960s, as well as American singers who recorded in Britain, such as Mel Tormé. He also worked with some American artists under license from Columbia Records, such as Johnnie Ray, Doris Day and Rosemary Clooney. Franz&#x27;s production trademarks were a lush choir and big orchestras, provided by Wally Stott, Ivor Raymonde and Peter Knight.

Franz oversaw discs that matched first-class pop rock material and vocalists with the sort of orchestral production that was more typical of middle of the road pop. Franz&#x27;s role with these artists seems not to have been so much that of an innovator as one of a capable delegator. For Dusty Springfield&#x27;s first solo record in 1963, &quot;I Only Want to Be with You&quot;, and the many that followed – which were the best British equivalents to Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound – he relied heavily upon arranger Ivor Raymonde, who also co-wrote &quot;I Only Want To Be With You&quot;. Raymonde did some work on Walker Brothers hits (like &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot;), which were aided by engineer Peter Olliff. The more classical sounding Walker Brothers arrangements were frequently handled by Reg Guest.

Franz and Olliff continued to work with Scott Walker on the singer&#x27;s early solo albums, in which he developed a more serious and sombre approach to both repertoire and vocals. Walker and Franz were personal friends, and Franz arranged for Scott to study with British vocal instructor Freddie Winrose, who taught the singer much about breath control. However, Franz could not continue working with Walker after the singer left Philips to sign with CBS records in 1973, except to give valuable advice.

==Personal life and death==
Franz married his secretary, Moira Creamer, in 1966. His younger brother, Harold, worked as a promotion man for EMI Music Publishing. Franz would consume copious cups of tea and cigarettes at any time of day, but especially during recording sessions. He was proud of his Rolls-Royce car, which he bought from Philips artist Sir Harry Secombe.

Franz, who was known as the &quot;last of the great pros&quot;, died of a heart attack in 1977 whilst in London&#x27;s Brompton Hospital, at the age of 54. A memorial service was held for him at St Martin-in-the-Fields soon afterwards.

==Production credits==
Franz produced ten UK number ones enjoying, in total, twenty eight weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart.

<text>Curtius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern part of the Moon. From the Earth the crater appears foreshortened, making it more difficult to observe detail. Nevertheless, this is a large crater that can be readily found in even small telescopes. Curtius is located within one crater diameter of the still-larger Moretus to the southwest. To the northeast is the smaller Pentland. Curtius is 95 kilometers in diameter and 6.8 kilometers deep. It is from the Nectarian period, 3.92 to 3.85 billion years ago.

It is named after Albert Curtz. 

==Background==
The outer rim of Curtius has been softened due to impact erosion, but it retains much of its original structure. Along the north and northwest parts of the rim are a pair of notable outward bulges that ruin the overall symmetry of the crater. There is a small satellite crater, Curtius E, lying across the eastern rim, and a small, bowl-shaped craterlet Curtius A along the southern rim.
The interior floor is relatively level, with a low, rounded central peaks near the midpoint. The northern part of the inner wall has extended further into the crater floor than elsewhere, producing a slightly irregular surface. The floor is covered by a number of tiny craterlets, but there are no other impacts of note across the interior.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Curtius.

<text>Coyuya is a station on the Mexico City Metro.

==General information==
Coyuya is on Line 8, between Metro Santa Anita and Metro Iztacalco. It is located in the Iztacalco borough, in the eastern portion of the Mexican Federal District, and serves the Colonia Tlazintla district and neighbourhoods surrounding Avenida Coyuya, Avenida Francisco del Paso y Troncoso &quot;(eje&quot; 3-Ote), and Avenida Plutarco Elías Calles &quot;(eje&quot; 4-Sur).
A surface station, it was first opened to public passenger traffic on 20 July 1994.

===Ridership===
==Name and iconography==
The station logo depicts the ankle of an Aztec dancer festooned with a cuff-rattle made from nutshells – a pre-Hispanic musical instrument known by the Spanish name &quot;cascabel&quot; (similar to jingle bells). &quot;Coyuya&quot; is a Nahuatl toponym that means &quot;place where &quot;cascabeles&quot; are made&quot;.

<doc id="1194393" wikidata="Q1452250" url="?curid=1194393" title="Roadrunner">
<text>The roadrunners (genus Geococcyx), also known as chaparral birds or chaparral cocks, are two species of fast-running ground cuckoos with long tails and crests. They are found in the southwestern and south-central United States, Mexico and Central America, usually in the desert. Although capable of flight, roadrunners generally run away from predators. On the ground, some have been measured at .

== Species ==
The subfamily Neomorphinae, the New World ground cuckoos, includes 11 species of birds, while the genus &quot;Geococcyx&quot; has just two:



== Morphology ==
The roadrunner generally ranges in size from from tail to beak. The average weight is about . The roadrunner is a slender, black-brown and white-streaked ground bird with a distinctive head crest. It has long legs, strong feet, and an oversized dark bill. The tail is broad with white tips on the three outer tail feathers. The bird has a bare patch of skin behind each eye; this patch is shaded blue anterior to red posterior. The lesser roadrunner is slightly smaller, not as streaky, and has a smaller bill. Both the lesser roadrunner and the greater roadrunner leave behind very distinct &quot;X&quot; track marks appearing as if they are travelling in both directions.

Roadrunners and other members of the cuckoo family have zygodactyl feet. The roadrunner can run at speeds of up to and generally prefer sprinting to flying, though it will fly to escape predators. During flight, the short, rounded wings reveal a white crescent in the primary feathers.

=== Vocalization===
The roadrunner has a slow and descending dove-like &quot;coo&quot;. It also makes a rapid, vocalized clattering sound with its beak.

== Geographic range ==
Roadrunners inhabit the Southwestern United States, to parts of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana, as well as Mexico and Central America. They live in arid lowland or mountainous shrubland or woodland. They are non-migratory, staying in their breeding area year-round. The greater roadrunner is not currently considered threatened in the US, but is habitat-limited.

== Food and foraging habits ==
The roadrunner is an opportunistic omnivore. Its diet normally consists of insects (such as grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, and beetles), small reptiles (such as lizards and snakes, including rattlesnakes), rodents and other small mammals, spiders (including tarantulas), scorpions, centipedes, snails, small birds (and nestlings), eggs, and fruits and seeds like those from prickly pear cactuses and sumacs. The lesser roadrunner eats mainly insects. The roadrunner forages on the ground and, when hunting, usually runs after prey from under cover. It may leap to catch insects, and commonly batters certain prey against the ground. The roadrunner is one of the few animals that preys upon rattlesnakes; it is also the only real predator of tarantula hawk wasps.

== Behavior and breeding ==
The roadrunner usually lives alone or in pairs. Breeding pairs are monogamous and mate for life, and pairs may hold a territory all year. During the courtship display, the male bows, alternately lifting and dropping his wings and spreading his tail. He parades in front of the female with his head high and his tail and wings drooped, and may bring an offering of food. The reproductive season is spring to mid-summer (depending on geographic location and species).

The roadrunner&#x27;s nest is often composed of sticks, and may sometimes contain leaves, feathers, snakeskins, or dung. It is commonly placed above ground level in a low tree, bush, or cactus. Roadrunner eggs are generally white. The greater roadrunner generally lays 2–6 eggs per clutch, but the lesser roadrunner&#x27;s clutches are typically smaller. Hatching is asynchronous. Both sexes incubate the nest (with males incubating the nest at night) and feed the hatchlings. For the first one to two weeks after the young hatch, one parent remains at the nest. The young leave the nest at two to three weeks old, foraging with parents for a few days after.

== Thermoregulation ==
During the cold desert night, the roadrunner lowers its body temperature slightly, going into a slight torpor to conserve energy. To warm itself during the day, the roadrunner exposes dark patches of skin on its back to the sun.

== Indigenous lore ==

The Hopi and other Pueblo tribes believed roadrunners were &quot;medicine&quot; birds, capable of warding off evil spirits. The X-shaped footprints of roadrunners were seen as sacred symbols, believed to confuse evil spirits by concealing the bird&#x27;s direction of travel. Stylized roadrunner tracks have been found in the rock art of ancestral Southwestern tribes like the Mogollon cultures. Roadrunner feathers were used to decorate Pueblo cradleboards for spiritual protection. Among Mexican Indian and American Indian tribes, such as the Pima, seeing a roadrunner is considered good luck. While some Mexican tribes revered the roadrunner and never killed it, most used its meat as a folk remedy for illness or to boost stamina and strength.

Central American Indigenous peoples have various beliefs about the roadrunner. The Ch’orti’, known to call it t’unk’u’x or mu’, have taboos against harming the bird. The Ch&#x27;ol Maya believe roadrunners possess special powers, calling it ajkumtz’u’ due to its call, which is believed to induce tiredness in listeners.

The word for roadrunner in the O&#x27;odham language is , which is the name of a transit center in Tucson, Arizona. In the O&#x27;odham tradition, the roadrunner is also credited with bringing fire to the people.

==In media==
The roadrunner is the state bird of New Mexico. The roadrunner was made popular by the Warner Bros. cartoon characters Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, created in 1949, and the subject of a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts. In each episode, the cunning, insidious, and constantly hungry Wile E. Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, but is never successful. The cartoons led to a misconception that the call of the roadrunner is &quot;meep, meep&quot; because the roadrunner in this cartoon series made that sound instead of the aforementioned sound of a real roadrunner. In some shorts, the Road Runner makes a noise while sticking his tongue out at Wile E. Coyote, which resembles its actual call. The cartoons rely on a misconception that a roadrunner is much faster than a coyote. In fact, a coyote&#x27;s fastest sprinting speed is , which is twice that of a roadrunner&#x27;s at .

<text>Beefmaster is a breed of beef cattle that was developed in the early 1930s by Tom Lasater (the breed founder), from a systematic crossing of Hereford cows and Shorthorn cows with Brahman bulls. The exact mixture of the foundation cattle is unknown, but is thought to be about 25% Hereford, 25% Milking Shorthorn and 50% Brahman. It was first recognized by the USDA as a new breed in 1954. The original intention was to produce cattle that could produce economically in the difficult environment of South Texas. The cattle were selected by using the Six Essentials – weight, conformation, milking ability, fertility, hardiness and disposition. While brownish-red is the most common color, the breed has no color standards. Over the past decade, the Beefmaster breed has become very popular among herd managers using the breed in their heterosis programs for hybrid vigor. These cattle are a versatile breed and adapt to many climates.

<text>Peter Hyams (born July 26, 1943) is an American film director, screenwriter and cinematographer known for directing the 1977 conspiracy thriller film &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (which he also wrote), the 1981 science fiction-thriller &quot;Outland&quot;, the 1984 science fiction film &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (a sequel to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;), the 1986 action/comedy &quot;Running Scared&quot;, the comic book adaptation &quot;Timecop&quot;, the action film &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (both starring Jean-Claude Van Damme), and the horror films &quot;The Relic&quot; and &quot;End of Days&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hyams was born in New York City, New York, the son of Ruth Hurok and Barry Hyams, who was a theatrical producer and publicist on Broadway. His maternal grandfather was Sol Hurok, the Russian Jewish impresario. His stepfather was blacklisted conductor Arthur Lief. His sister is casting director Nessa Hyams. His son John Hyams is also a film director.

===Television===
Hyams studied art and music at Hunter College and Syracuse University before working as a producer/anchorman for WHDH-TV. During 1966 while working for a CBS owned station in New York, he served three months as a news correspondent in Vietnam. He worked in Boston then in January 1968 he joined WBBM-TV in Chicago as an anchorman and reporter to replace Fahey Flynn. A contemporary report described him as a &quot;glamor type&quot;.

During his time with CBS (where he worked from 1964 to 1970), he then began to shoot documentary films.

===Screenwriter===
Hyams moved to Los Angeles in 1970 where he sold his first screenplay, &quot;T.R. Baskin&quot;, to Paramount Pictures in 1971. Herbert Ross directed the film and Hyams produced.

===Directing===
Hyams made his directorial debut with an ABC Movie of the Week for Aaron Spelling, &quot;Rolling Man&quot; (1972) starring Dennis Weaver. Hyams worked on it solely as director, with the script being written by the producers.

Hyams followed it directing another TV movie which he also wrote, &quot;Goodnight, My Love&quot; (1972), about a private eye and a dwarf. The film was highly acclaimed.

Hyams optioned a novel &quot;Going All the Way&quot; which he intended to adapt and direct but it was not made.

The praise for &quot;Goodnight My Love&quot; meant Hyams was able to get finance for his debut feature as writer-director, &quot;Busting&quot; (1974), a buddy cop movie starring Elliott Gould and Robert Blake. He followed it with &quot;Our Time&quot; (1974), a romance with Pamela Sue Martin, which he directed only.

Hyams made &quot;Peeper&quot; (1975), for the producers of &quot;Busting&quot; with Michael Caine and Natalie Wood. It was a financial failure and Hyams&#x27; career was at a low ebb. He wrote the script &quot;Hanover Street&quot; which he could have sold outright but Hyams insisted on directing. He wrote the screenplay for the Charles Bronson thriller &quot;Telefon&quot; (1977), doing a draft for Richard Lester (who ended up not directing the film). It was rewritten extensively.

===&quot;Capricorn One&quot;===
Hyams had written the script for &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1977) a number of years earlier. It was a conspiracy thriller about a faked mission to Mars. Paul Lazarus managed to raise financing with Hyams as director and the film was his first hit.

This was followed by the less successful &quot;Hanover Street&quot; (1979) which starred Harrison Ford.

Hyams did a rewrite of Ted Leighton&#x27;s screenplay for the Steve McQueen film &quot;The Hunter&quot; (1980) which he was to direct. However he dropped out after clashes with McQueen.

He wanted to do a Western but was unable to get financing so he then wrote and directed the science fiction cult classic &quot;Outland&quot; (1981), which starred Sean Connery in a &#x27;High Noon&#x27; scenario set on Io, one of Jupiter&#x27;s moons.

Hyams directed the thriller &quot;The Star Chamber&quot; (1983), starring Michael Douglas, also rewriting the script.

===MGM===
For MGM Hyams produced, directed, and wrote the screenplay for &quot;2010&quot; (1984), collaborating closely with author Arthur C. Clarke (&quot;2010&quot;).

Hyams also co-authored with Clarke &quot;The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010&quot;, published 1985, a collection of their email correspondence which illustrates their fascination with the then pioneering medium, and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis while planning and producing the film.

Hyams directed an episode of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Falsworth&quot;.

Hyams had a hit with a buddy cop film, &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1986) at MGM with Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal.

He followed it with &quot;The Presidio&quot; (1988), another buddy action film, starring Sean Connery and Mark Harmon. In between he executive produced the 1980s cult kids movie &quot;The Monster Squad&quot; (1987).

Less popular was &quot;Narrow Margin&quot; (1990), a remake of the 1952 film, and the comedy &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; (1992).

===Jean-Claude Van Damme===
Hyams had a big hit with the Jean-Claude Van Damme film &quot;Timecop&quot; (1994). The director and actor subsequently reteamed on &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (1995) which did less well.

Hyams did a horror monster movie called &quot;The Relic&quot; (1997) which received mixed reviews and grossed $48 million at the box office.

The blockbuster &quot;End of Days&quot; (1999) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is the highest-grossing film in Hyams&#x27; career, grossing over $200 million at the worldwide box-office but was met with negative critical reception.

Hyams followed with &quot;The Musketeer&quot; (2001), a new version of the novel by Alexandre Dumas, which was a minor box office success.

However, his next film, &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; (2005), a science-fiction movie, had serious difficulties during its production (including the bankruptcy of the original production company during post-production), performed particularly badly at the box office worldwide and was poorly received by critics.

He directed an episode of the series &quot;Threshold&quot; (2005).

In 2007, it was reported that he would direct the remake of his own &quot;Capricorn One&quot;; instead he directed the remake of the 1956 film noir &quot;Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&quot; starring Michael Douglas, which was released in 2009, was a box office flop, and panned by critics.

===Reunion with Van Damme===
Hyams also contributed the cinematography to his son John&#x27;s effort, &quot;Universal Soldier: Regeneration&quot;, the third official &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; sequel starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren.

Hyams directed the thriller &quot;Enemies Closer&quot; which began filming in late 2012. It marked his fourth (third directorial) collaboration with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

===&quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;===
Hyams was interviewed by Ezra Edelman in the latter&#x27;s documentary &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;, which touched on Hyams&#x27; former friendship with O. J. Simpson, whom he had directed in &quot;Capricorn One&quot;. In his interview, Hyams revealed his initial belief that Simpson was innocent of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, but began to have doubts following the revelation of DNA evidence that suggested otherwise. Hyams said he felt particularly betrayed when Simpson continued to insist that he was innocent when Hyams&#x27; friend also began to voice his doubts about Simpson&#x27;s innocence. Following Simpson&#x27;s acquittal, Hyams stated that he found the African-American celebration of the acquittal to be particularly offensive and hurtful, and later severed his ties with Simpson.

==Personal life==
On December 19, 1964, Hyams married George-Ann Spota, with whom he has three sons. His first son, Chris Hyams, is the CEO of the job search website Indeed. His second son, John Hyams, is also a film director; Peter performed cinematography duties on John&#x27;s film &quot;Universal Soldier: Regeneration&quot;. His third son, Nick Hyams, works as a battle rap promoter and host under the name Lush One.

==Trademark==
Hyams is known for being his own cinematographer on the movies he has directed since 1984.

As a reference to his wife&#x27;s family, there is a minor character named Spota in many of his films, including those which he only wrote (such as 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Hunter&quot;); the exceptions being &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; (although there was a market called &quot;Spota&#x27;s&quot;), &quot;End of Days&quot; (although there was a bar called &quot;Spota&#x27;s&quot;), &quot;Narrow Margin&quot;, &quot;Running Scared&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Hanover Street&quot; and &quot;Peeper&quot;. In &quot;Hanover Street&quot;, Harrison Ford pilots a B-25 bomber named Gorgeous George-Ann.

<text>&quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; is an American patriotic song and ceremonial entrance march of the vice president of the United States. It was originally considered to be one of the unofficial national anthems of the United States until 1931, when &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was named as the official national anthem. Columbia is the name for the national personification of the United States which originated during the 18th century.

==History==

The music was composed by Philip Phile in 1789 for the first inauguration of George Washington and titled &quot;The President&#x27;s March&quot;. It became the song &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; when arranged with lyrics by Joseph Hopkinson in 1798. The song gained popularity during the XYZ Affair and subsequent Quasi-War with France. The song was used in the United States as a de facto national anthem throughout the 19th century. However, the song lost popularity after World War I until it was replaced by &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; in 1931.

It was the personal anthem for the president, until it was replaced by the song &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;, and it is now the official vice president&#x27;s personal anthem. The song is always preceded by four ruffles and flourishes when introducing the vice president. It has also been used as a slow march during military ceremonies, often while the band countermarches.

<doc id="1194415" wikidata="Q5639191" url="?curid=1194415" title="Hail Mary pass">
<text>A Hail Mary pass is a very long forward pass in American football, typically made in desperation, with a very small chance of achieving a completion. Due to the difficulty of a completion with this pass, it makes reference to the Catholic &quot;Hail Mary&quot; prayer for strength and help.

The expression goes back at least to the 1930s, when it was used publicly by Elmer Layden and Jim Crowley, two former members of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish&#x27;s Four Horsemen. Originally meaning any sort of desperation play, a Hail Mary pass gradually came to denote a long, low-probability pass, typically of the &quot;alley-oop&quot; variety, attempted at the end of a half when a team is too far from the end zone to execute a more conventional play, implying that it would take a miracle for the play to succeed. For more than 40 years, use of the term was largely confined to Notre Dame and other Catholic universities.

The term became widespread after an NFL playoff game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Minnesota Vikings on December 28, 1975 (see Cowboys–Vikings rivalry), when Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach (a devout Catholic) said about his game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Drew Pearson, &quot;I closed my eyes and said a Hail Mary.&quot;

== Origins ==

Crowley often told the story of a game between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech on October 28, 1922, in which the Fighting Irish players said Hail Mary prayers together before scoring each of the touchdowns, before winning the game 13–3. According to Crowley, it was one of the team&#x27;s linemen, Noble Kizer (a Presbyterian), who suggested praying before the first touchdown, which occurred on a fourth and goal play at the Georgia Tech 6-yard line during the second quarter. Quarterback Harry Stuhldreher, another of the Horsemen, threw a quick pass over the middle to Paul Castner for the score. The ritual was repeated before a third and goal play, again at Georgia Tech&#x27;s 6-yard line, in the fourth quarter. This time Stuhldreher ran for a touchdown, which sealed the win for Notre Dame. After the game, Kizer exclaimed to Crowley, &quot;Say, that Hail Mary is the best play we&#x27;ve got.&quot; Crowley related this story many times in public speeches beginning in the 1930s.

On November 2, 1935, with 32 seconds left in the so-called &quot;Game of the Century&quot; between Ohio State and Notre Dame, Irish halfback Bill Shakespeare found receiver Wayne Millner for a 19-yard, game-winning touchdown. Notre Dame head coach Elmer Layden, who had played in the 1922 Georgia Tech game, afterwards called it a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; play.

An early appearance of the term was in an Associated Press story about the upcoming 1941 Orange Bowl between the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the Georgetown Hoyas. The piece appeared in several newspapers including the December 31, 1940, &quot;Daytona Beach Morning Journal&quot; under the headline, &quot;Orange Bowl: [Georgetown] Hoyas Put Faith in &#x27;Hail Mary&#x27; Pass&quot;. As the article explained, &quot;A &#x27;hail Mary&#x27; pass, in the talk of the Washington eleven, is one that is thrown with a prayer because the odds against completion are big.&quot; During an NBC broadcast in 1963, Staubach, then a Navy quarterback, described a pass play during his team&#x27;s victory over Michigan that year as a &quot;Hail Mary play&quot;. He scrambled to escape a pass rush, nearly getting sacked 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage before completing a desperation pass for a one-yard gain.

== Examples ==
Arguably the most memorable and replayed Hail Mary walk-off touchdown pass came on November 23, 1984, in a game now known as &quot;Hail Flutie&quot;. Boston College was trailing Miami (FL) 45–41 with six seconds left, when their quarterback Doug Flutie threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to Gerard Phelan, succeeding primarily because Miami&#x27;s secondary stood on the goal line to keep the receivers in front of them without covering a post route behind them.

Miami&#x27;s defense was based on the assumption that the five-foot-nine-inch Flutie could not throw the ball as far as the end zone: instead, Flutie hit Phelan in stride against a flatfooted defense a yard deep in the end zone as time expired. To commemorate the play, a statue of Flutie in his Hail Mary passing pose was unveiled outside Alumni Stadium at Boston College on November 7, 2008.

Other noteworthy examples include:
* December 19, 1980: Known as &quot;The Miracle Bowl&quot;, Brigham Young University (BYU) quarterback Jim McMahon threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to tight end Clay Brown to defeat Southern Methodist University in the 1980 Holiday Bowl 46–45, which completed Brigham Young&#x27;s comeback from a 45–25 deficit with four minutes remaining.
* November 20, 1983: In a Week 12 matchup featuring the San Francisco 49ers vs the Atlanta Falcons, Falcon&#x27;s quarterback Steve Bartowski threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot; Johnson with no time left on the clock to win, 24–28. Johnson caught the ball at the six yard line, ran to his right and was tackled into the endzone by three 49er defenders.
* September 24, 1994: Known as the &quot;Miracle at Michigan&quot;, Colorado quarterback Kordell Stewart threw a 64-yard walk-off touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Westbrook to beat Michigan 27–26. Stewart&#x27;s pass had traveled 73 yards in the air from the Colorado 26 to the opposite 1-yard line, was tipped by Blake Anderson, then caught by Westbrook four yards deep in the end zone.
* October 31, 1999: The Cleveland Browns&#x27; first win after returning as an expansion team came on a Hail Mary walk-off touchdown against the New Orleans Saints, when Browns quarterback Tim Couch avoided the Saints pass rush and launched a 56-yard pass that was tipped up in the air and caught by receiver Kevin Johnson near the pylon for a 21–16 Browns victory.
* November 9, 2002: Known as the &quot;Bluegrass Miracle&quot;, Louisiana State University quarterback Marcus Randall threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Devery Henderson in the game to defeat Kentucky 33–30.
* December 8, 2002: Three years after his first Hail Mary, Tim Couch won another game with a game-ender against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Couch launched a 50-yard Hail Mary that was caught by Quincy Morgan, and the ensuing extra point gave the Browns a 21–20 win. Although he remains a hotly debated player - due to being picked #1 overall in the 1999 NFL draft and his injury-plagued career - Tim Couch remains the only NFL player to win two games on game-ending Hail Marys.
* October 22, 2011: Known as &quot;Rocket&quot;, Michigan State quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a 44-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keith Nichol to beat Wisconsin 37–31.
* November 16, 2013: Known as the &quot;Prayer at Jordan-Hare&quot;, Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ricardo Louis on fourth-and-18 with 36 seconds left to beat Georgia 43–38. Louis caught the ball after one Georgia defender tipped it away from another.
* November 10, 2013: With the Baltimore Ravens leading 17–10 on the last play of their game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton launched a 51-yard Hail Mary to the end zone, where a Ravens player tipped the ball in the air directly to A. J. Green for a touchdown. Despite this game-tying score, the Ravens won the game in overtime, 20–17.
* September 5, 2015: Known as the &quot;Miracle at Memorial&quot;, BYU quarterback Tanner Mangum threw a desperate 42-yard pass to wide receiver Mitch Mathews as time expired to defeat Nebraska 33–28 at Memorial Stadium, and break a streak of 29 consecutive home opener victories for the Cornhuskers. Mangum, a freshman just two months removed from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was the backup to senior Taysom Hill, who had left the game earlier with a season-ending Lisfranc injury, and was playing in his first organized football game in nearly four years.
* December 3, 2015: Known as the &quot;Miracle in Motown&quot;, a 15-yard defensive facemask penalty on the Detroit Lions as time expired gave the Green Bay Packers, who had been trailing the entire game, an additional untimed down. Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard touchdown pass which left his hand at Green Bay&#x27;s 35-yard line and was caught four yards into the end zone by tight end Richard Rodgers to give the Packers a 27–23 win. The total distance of 69 yards is the longest Hail Mary pass in NFL history.
* January 16, 2016: In the postseason after the Miracle in Motown, Aaron Rodgers completed a second Hail Mary pass: faced with a 4th and 20 on his own 4-yard line and a 20–13 deficit against the Arizona Cardinals in the final minute of the game, Rodgers threw a 60-yard completion to Jeff Janis. On the final play of regulation, he completed a 41-yard touchdown pass to Janis, making Green Bay the first postseason team ever to score a game-tying touchdown on the final play of the 4th quarter. Despite this, Arizona won the game in overtime largely through the efforts of Larry Fitzgerald, who went all the way to the Green Bay 5-yard line on a short pass he caught while wide open before scoring two plays afterwards.
* September 10, 2016: After Oklahoma State football quarterback Mason Rudolph threw the ball up into the air as time expired, it was ruled intentional grounding: under college football rules, the game should have ended and Oklahoma State should have defeated Central Michigan 27–24. However, both on-field officials (from Central Michigan&#x27;s home of the Mid-American Conference) and replay officials (from Oklahoma State&#x27;s home of the Big 12 Conference) missed the call and gave Central Michigan an untimed down. CMU quarterback Cooper Rush threw a 49-yard Hail Mary to receiver Jesse Kroll, who then lateraled to Malik Fountain, who ran it into the end zone to win the game 30–27.
* October 1, 2016: After a 47-yard touchdown pass with ten seconds remaining on the clock, a Georgia player took off his helmet during the celebration, resulting in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. The kickoff was returned to the Georgia 43-yard line: on the final play, Tennessee QB Joshua Dobbs threw a game-winning touchdown, caught by Jauan Jennings, as time expired to win 34–31.
* January 8, 2017: In a wildcard playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants, Aaron Rodgers completed a 42-yard pass to Randall Cobb over a crowd of players from both teams on the last play before halftime. This gave Green Bay a 14–6 halftime lead, and they went on to win 38–13.
* September 16, 2017: In a key Southeastern Conference matchup between the Florida Gators and the Tennessee Volunteers, Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks completed a 63-yard pass to Tyrie Cleveland as time expired to give UF a 26–20 win.
*November 15, 2020: In a week 10 game against the Buffalo Bills, Kyler Murray completed a 43-yard touchdown pass to receiver DeAndre Hopkins in the final seconds of the game. Hopkins caught the ball over three Bills defenders for a touchdown to win the game 32–30.
*September 17, 2022: During a &quot;College GameDay&quot; between Appalachian State and Troy, Appalachian State quarterback, Chase Brice, threw a 63-yard pass as time expired to Christan Horn who caught the pass for a touchdown, allowing Appalachian State to win, 32–28.
*September 17, 2023: In the dwindling seconds of a Week 2 matchup between the Washington Commanders and Denver Broncos, Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson completed a 50-yard touchdown pass to receiver Brandon Johnson to bring the game within a conversion, 35–33. Despite the incredible catch, which came off of multiple Commanders players deflecting the ball, the Broncos failed to complete the subsequent two-point conversion.
*October 14, 2024: In a Week 6 Monday night game between the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets, Aaron Rodgers threw a 52-yard deep pass to Allen Lazard into the end zone, crowded around the Bills defense on the last play before halftime. It was initially ruled as an incomplete pass, however, with the assistance of replay assist, the ruling was changed to a touchdown. The score after the PAT was 20-17 going into halftime. Despite this, Buffalo won the game 23–20.
*October 27, 2024: Known as the &quot;Hail Maryland&quot;, Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels threw a deep middle pass for 52 yards to receiver Noah Brown for a walk-off Commanders touchdown to beat Chicago 18–15. According to NextGen Stats, Daniels scrambled for 12.79 seconds to make the play possible, the longest since the statistic was begun in 2016. His pass of 64 yards in the air is the second-longest successful NFL Hail Mary behind Aaron Rodgers&#x27;s 69-yarder in the 2015 &quot;Miracle in Motown.&quot;

== Metaphorical usage in other fields ==
The term &quot;Hail Mary&quot; is sometimes used to refer to any last-ditch effort with little chance of success.

In military uses, General Norman Schwarzkopf described his strategy during the Persian Gulf War to bypass the bulk of Iraqi forces in Kuwait by attacking in a wide left sweep through their rear as a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; plan. This usage, however, did not refer to the plan&#x27;s chances of success but to the movement of Coalition forces to the left side of the front lines prior to the attack, which reflected the formation for a Hail Mary pass in which all the offensive team&#x27;s wide receivers line up on one side of the line of scrimmage.

Various legal actions attempting to overturn Donald Trump&#x27;s defeat in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, in particular the &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot; Supreme Court lawsuit, were described as &quot;Hail Marys&quot;.

There are similar usages in other fields, such as a &quot;Hail Mary shot&quot; in photography where a photographer holds the view finder of an SLR camera away from the eyes (so unable to compose the picture), usually high above the head, and takes a shot. This is often used in crowded situations.

In computer security, a &quot;Hail Mary attack&quot; will throw every exploit it has against a system to see whether any of them work.

When the Pennsylvania Republican Party sold its headquarters in Harrisburg to the Catholic Church, this was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a real-life Hail Mary&quot;.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Pope Francis&#x27; attempts to stop the conflict by consecrating Russia and Ukraine to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was called the &quot;Pope&#x27;s Hail Mary pass&quot;.

At the end of the NASCAR Cup Series&#x27; 2022 Xfinity 500 at Martinsville Speedway, Ross Chastain&#x27;s wall-ride move to get the positions he needed to clinch a spot in the Championship 4 was given the name &quot;Hail Melon&quot;, combining the name of the football pass play with Chastain&#x27;s association with watermelons.

<doc id="1194423" wikidata="Q721898" url="?curid=1194423" title="Quintus Pompeius Falco">
<text>Quintus Pompeius Falco (c. 70after 140 AD) was a Roman senator and general of the early 2nd century AD. He was governor of several provinces, most notably Roman Britain, where he hosted a visit to the province by the Emperor Hadrian in the last year. Falco achieved the rank of suffect consul for the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September to December 108 with Marcus Titius Lustricus Bruttianus as his colleague.

== Name ==
His complete name was Quintus Roscius Coelius Murena Silius Decianus Vibullius Pius Julius Eurycles Herculanus Pompeius Falco, an example of polyonymy. Werner Eck has shown that Falco was the son of Sextus Pompeius Falco and Clodia P.f. Falconilla who came from Sicily, as well as identifying a brother, Quintus Pompeius Pr[iscus]. The earliest inscriptions to mention him, dated to his governorship of Lower Moesia (115-118), use the name Quintus Roscius Murena Coelius Pompeius Falco, indicating that he was adopted (&quot;condicio nominis ferendi&quot;) by another Senator in hopes of preserving his lineage. The name of this man has been disputed. Both Ronald Syme and Anthony Birley identify him as Marcus Roscius Coelius, the suffect consul of the year 81. There is also the proconsul of Bithynia and Pontus, Marcus (Roscius) Murena, his son Marcus (Roscius) Murena, and his grandson Marcus Roscius Quirnia Lupus Murena, quaestor of Creta et Cyrenaica. However, as Olli Salomies notes in his monograph on Imperial naming practices, the adoptive father would have the &quot;praenomen&quot; &quot;Quintus&quot;, as Falco has, not &quot;Marcus&quot;. Salomies believes his adoptive father was a Quintus Roscius, most likely from Sicily, who could be related to either of the Roscii mentioned.

The latest inscription to mention him, dated to the year 123, uses his full name. Thus between 119 and 123 he acquired the name elements &quot;Silius Decianus Vibullius Pius Julius Eurycles Herculanus&quot;. The first two refer to a suffect consul of the year 94, Lucius Silius Decianus. The remaining elements come from the last of the Euryclids of Sparta, Gaius Julius Eurycles Herculanus, who is known to have died around 136/137; the elements &quot;Vibullius Pius&quot; come from another senator, Lucius Vibullius Pius, who actually adopted by testament Eurycles Herculanus. These names provide evidence for a fragment of the complex social network that Falco built up over his lifetime, which is often unknown in whole or even in part for his contemporaries.

== Life ==

=== Early life and career ===
An inscription recovered from Hierapolis ad Pyramum provides details of Falco&#x27;s career in the imperial service. He started as a member of one of the four boards of the &quot;vigintiviri&quot;, the &quot;decemviri stlitibus judicandis&quot;; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. A letter from Pliny the Younger to Falco written in 97 helps fix the date he advanced to the next magistracy, plebeian tribune, and indicates Falco was born around the year 70. While tribune, Falco at least once used his prerogative, interceding unsuccessfully for Aulus Didius Gallus Fabricius Veiento, favorite of the hated emperor Domitian and thrice consul, during the stormy session of the Senate when Pliny attacked Publicius Certus. Despite his defense of Veiento, Pliny was not offended by Falco&#x27;s action, or at least not much for his later letters to Falco are cordial. McDermott dates Falco&#x27;s tenure as praetor peregrinus to 99 or 100.

=== Dacian Wars, subsequent governorships ===
Birley describes Falco&#x27;s career as &quot;undistinguished&quot; until he was put in command of the Legio V Macedonica during the First Dacian War (101-2). His actions while commanding the legion earned him &quot;dona militaria&quot;. Following the conclusion of the war, he was made governor of Lycia et Pamphylia, and then (&quot;unusually&quot;, notes Anthony Birley) Judea; Birley speculates that the annexation of territory that became the province of Arabia Petraea &quot;made it desirable to appoint a particularly experienced man to the adjacent province.&quot; His consulship followed not long after, which he may have held &quot;in absentia&quot;.

Upon his return to Rome, Falco became the first curator of the Via Traiana. While admitting that this was not a post of major importance, especially for a consular whose earlier and later appointments were so notable, McDermott notes Trajan&#x27;s concern for roads and other infrastructure, and that the existing Via Appia, which ran through the Pomptine Marshes, was inadequate for traffic. Thus &quot;his charge was really to build the road&quot; and work was completed by the year 112. After a few years without employment, Falco served as governor of Moesia Inferior, where he is attested in 116 and 117. His appointment to govern Britain came soon after; Birley opines that it &quot;must have been one of Hadrian&#x27;s first acts.&quot;

=== Suppressing rebels in Britain ===
The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; reports that when Hadrian became emperor, he was confronted with a series of rebellions across the empire, which included Britain where &quot;the Britons could not be kept under Roman control&quot;. Sheppard Frere puts the Brigantes at the center of the rebellion in Britain, who had close ties to the Selgovae and the Novantae, in southern Caledonia. Frere notes we lack many of the details of this insurrection, but an inscription from Jarrow and commemorative coins issued in 119 attest to Falco&#x27;s supposed success in crushing the revolt. A reference by the orator Fronto to many soldiers being killed in Britannia under Hadrian&#x27;s rule has been suggested as indicating that the victory was hard-won. However, Fronto may have been referring to a different conflict.

=== Governor of Asia ===
In 122 Hadrian visited the island of Britain, and decreed numerous reforms for the province, which included the construction of the fortifications known as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. To implement them, however, the emperor replaced Falco with Aulus Platorius Nepos, and returned to Rome. Although he arrived in Rome too late to participate in the sortition for proconsular governorship for that year, the following year Falco received authority over the province of Asia for 123/124, considered one of the pinnacles of a successful senatorial career. McDermott notes that both of his previous postings had been difficult ones, and he most likely spent his years in those distant places without his family; whether this was the case, there is evidence that his wife and son accompanied him to this province.

=== Retirement ===
When Falco returned home from Asia, he retired from his public career to his estates, likely near Tusculum. Pompeius Falco is last heard of in a letter by the young Marcus Aurelius to Fronto, likely written in 143, in which he recalls a visit to Falco&#x27;s estate three years prior. There the elderly senator and soldier showed the boy and his father around the grounds, and pointed out a tree with numerous branches that Falco called a .

== Family ==
Falco married Sosia Polla, the daughter of Quintus Sosius Senecio, twice consul (cos. 99, 107), and the granddaughter of Sextus Iulius Frontinus, also a three-time consul (cos. 97, 98, 100); McDermott dates their marriage to after Falco&#x27;s return from Judea—namely, either the year 108 or slightly later. They are known to have had at least one son, Quintus Pompeius Sosius Priscus, consul in 149.

<text>Wharton&#x27;s jelly (&quot;substantia gelatinea funiculi umbilicalis&quot;) is a gelatinous substance within the umbilical cord, largely made up of mucopolysaccharides (hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate). It acts as a mucous connective tissue containing some fibroblasts and macrophages, and is derived from extra-embryonic mesoderm of the connecting stalk.

==Umbilical cord occlusion==

As a mucous connective tissue, it is rich in proteoglycans, and protects and insulates umbilical blood vessels. Wharton&#x27;s jelly, when exposed to temperature changes, collapses structures within the umbilical cord and thus provides a physiological clamping of the cord, typically three minutes after birth.

==Stem cells==
Cells in Wharton&#x27;s jelly express several stem cell genes, including telomerase. They can be extracted, cultured, and induced to differentiate into mature cell types such as neurons. Wharton&#x27;s jelly is therefore a potential source of adult stem cells, often collected from cord blood.

==Etymology==
It is named for the English physician and anatomist Thomas Wharton (1614–1673) who first described it in his publication &quot;Adenographia&quot;, or &quot;The Description of the Glands of the Entire Body&quot;, first published in 1656.

== Isolation of stem cells protocol ==
After obtaining the umbilical cord from the donor, it is transported to the laboratory in a cold and sterile environment using a transfer buffer that contains phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the vessels should be eliminated from the umbilical cord tissue on a sterile plate with the aid of autoclaved scissors. The sections of the umbilical cord tissue that are devoid of arteries should then be fragmented into smaller fragments. These tissue fragments are subsequently placed in a sterile cell culture plate or cell culture flask, and the cell culture medium (enriched with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) is added. Lastly, the flask containing the tissue fragments is placed in a CO2 incubator for a duration of 1-2 weeks. This process ultimately leads to the proliferation and migration of stem cells from the Wharton&#x27;s jelly into the plate or flask.

== Marketing ==
A 2024 editorial described a direct-to-consumer marketing email from a company in Arizona advertising a &quot;3 for 1&quot; sale on Exosomes or Whartons Jelly. The email stated that the products are &quot;manufactured in an FDA-registered, cGMP compliant, ISO certified lab&quot;, but did not mention that such birth products can be used only in a registered clinical trial, according to a directive from the United States Food and Drug Administration on May 31, 2021.

<doc id="1194426" wikidata="Q1192638" url="?curid=1194426" title="Yamaha YM2413">
<text>The YM2413, a.k.a. OPLL, is an FM synthesis sound chip manufactured by Yamaha Corporation. It is related to Yamaha&#x27;s OPL family of FM synthesis chips, and is a cost-reduced version of the YM3812 (OPL2).

== Technical details ==
Based on the YM3812, it features nine concurrent FM channels with two operators per channel. Common to the OPL family, it features a percussion mode (or rhythm mode) that turns the last three channels into percussion/rhythm channels to produce 5 percussion/rhythm sounds.

To make the chip cheaper to manufacture, many of the internal registers were removed. The result of this is that the YM2413 can only play one user-defined instrument at a time; the other 15 instrument settings are hard-coded and cannot be altered by the user. There were also some other cost-cutting modifications: the number of waveforms was reduced to two, additive mode was removed along with the 6-bit carrier volume control (channels instead have 15 levels of volume), and the channels are not mixed using an adder; instead, the chip&#x27;s built-in DAC uses time-division multiplexing to play short segments of each channel in sequence, which was also done in the YM2612 much later.

== Applications ==
The YM2413 was used in many devices, including:
* the FM Sound Unit add-on for the Sega Mark III sold exclusively in Japan, that improved the sound quality of all compatible games. The Japanese model of the Sega Master System came with this add-on built-in;
* an arcade board design produced by SNK and Alpha Denshi in the late 1980s for a number of their games, including &quot;Time Soldiers&quot;, &quot;Sky Soldiers&quot;, and &quot;Gang Wars&quot;;
* the Atari Games &quot;Rampart&quot; arcade game;
* the Yamaha PSS-170 and PSS-270 keyboards in 1986;
* the Yamaha SHS-10 shoulder keyboard in 1987, and the Yamaha PSS-140 and Yamaha SHS-200 in 1988;
* the Yamaha PSR-6 keyboard in 1988;
* several sound enhancement cartridges for MSX computers. It is also built into select MSX2 and MSX2+ systems, and all MSX Turbo R machines, as part of the MSX-Music standard; and
* JTES Japanese teletext receivers.

==Variants and clones==
*Konami VRC7 (Also known as &quot;VRC VII 053982&quot;) contains a YM2413 derivative, used on the Family Computer game &quot;Lagrange Point&quot;, as well as on a few redemption arcade machines. It has 6 FM channels instead of 9, lacks the rhythm channels, and has a different set of built in FM patches from the YM2413. While the chip was also known as the Yamaha DS1001, there are no official sources that have referenced this name, however it is labeled as such by Yamaha as an internal code.
**There is an undocumented debug mode that changes several inputs, including the ability to dump the chip&#x27;s FM patches as well as access to three additional channels, however this requires modification to the pinouts, which allowed access to the debug mode at the cost of disabling the internal mapper. Due to changes made to the YM2413-based core of the VRC7, the percussion/rhythm mode is not available at all, even when it has been reenabled. As a result, YM2413 streams using the rhythm channels will become completely inaudible on the VRC7 audio chips.
*Yamaha YM2420 (OPLL2) is a variant with slightly changed registers (intentionally undocumented to avoid hardware piracy), used in Yamaha&#x27;s own home keyboards. It has the same pinout and built-in FM patches as the YM2413, but several registers have parts of the bit order reversed.
*Yamaha YM2423 (OPLL-X) is another YM2413 derivative. It has the same pinout and register set as the YM2413, but a different set of built in FM patches.
*Yamaha YMF281 (OPLLP) is a later YM2413 derivative, possibly intended for pachinko or pachislot machines. It has the same pinout and register set as the YM2413, but a different set of built in FM patches.
*Yamaha YM2413B and YMF281B are low power variants of YM2413 and YMF281 respectively. These variants also reduced the crossover distortion of the built-in DAC. A lower power consumption indicates that these variants may be made using a CMOS process.
*Yamaha FHB013 is a later YM2413 derivative, using a 2-metal CMOS process instead of NMOS. It has the same pinout and register set as the YM2413, but a different set of built in FM patches. It may be the same chip as the YMF281B above, as it supposedly has the same patches. It may also be directly derived from the YM2413B, as the YMF281B was based on the YM2413B with different patches but also using the same CMOS process.
*UMC U3567 is a 100% software compatible chip with a slightly different pinout, requiring a pin-to-pin adapter in order to be used on a YM2413 socket.
*UMC UM3567 is a 100% software compatible chip, with the same pinout as the U3567 but has a slightly enhanced DAC output. It requires the same pin-to-pin adapter, but the different DAC output will also require the two pull-down resistors of the audio output pins to be removed from the mainboard.
*K-663A (sometimes known as the K-663 or K-633A) is a 100% software compatible chip, used on the Korean Family Computer karaoke game &quot;Family Noraebang&quot;, as well as on a few arcade machines. It is based on the UM3567, using the same pinouts and an enhanced DAC output. As with the U3567 and UM3567 chips, a pin-to-pin adapter is required to use the YM2413 sockets. Like the UM3567, the different DAC output will also require the two pull-down resistors of the audio output pins to be removed from the mainboard.

<doc id="1194427" wikidata="Q1163227" url="?curid=1194427" title="The Pillars of the Earth">
<text>The Pillars of the Earth is a historical novel by British author Ken Follett published in 1989 about the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. Set in the 12th century, the novel covers the time between the sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; and the murder of Thomas Becket, but focuses primarily on the Anarchy. The book traces the development of Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque architecture, and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory and village against the backdrop of historical events of the time.

Before this novel was published, Follett was known for writing in the thriller genre. &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; became his best-selling work. It was made into an 8-part miniseries in 2010, and a video game in 2017. The book was listed at no. 33 on the BBC&#x27;s Big Read, a 2003 survey with the goal of finding the &quot;nation&#x27;s best-loved book&quot;. The book was selected in the United States for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club in 2007. It is the first published book in Follett&#x27;s Kingsbridge Series. Three sequels and a prequel, each set in Kingsbridge during a different century, were published from 2007 to 2023.

==Background==
In the 1999 preface to &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, Follett tells readers that he grew up in a Puritan-based family, whose worship space was very sparse. In preparing for writing, he was reading about medieval architecture, and:
::... developed an interest in cathedrals. Before too long, it occurred to me to channel this enthusiasm into a novel. I knew it had to be a long book. It took at least thirty years to build a cathedral and most took longer because they would run out of money, or be attacked or invaded. So the story covers the entire lives of the main characters. My publishers were a little nervous about such a very unlikely subject but, paradoxically, it is my most popular book. It&#x27;s also the book I&#x27;m most proud of. It recreates, quite vividly, the entire life of the village and the people who live there. You feel you know the place and the people as intimately as if you yourself were living there in the Middle Ages.

The novel&#x27;s Kingsbridge is fictional. Follett set it in Marlborough, Wiltshire; he chose that location because the cathedrals of Winchester, Gloucester, and Salisbury could be reached from there within a few days on horseback. Kingsbridge Cathedral as described is based on the cathedrals of Wells and Salisbury. The Preface includes the following sources: &quot;An Outline of European Architecture,&quot; by Nikolaus Pevsner, &quot;The Cathedral Builders,&quot; by Jean Gimpel, and &quot;The Medieval Machine,&quot; by Jean Gimpel.

As well as the story of building a cathedral, and closely connected with it, the book depicts the growth of Kingsbridge from a backwoods village to a major town, the increasing wealth and assertiveness of the town&#x27;s merchants and artisans, to the point of their being able to stand up to the feudal aristocracy and defend their autonomy. While Kingsbridge is a fictional town, such developments are well attested in the history of various actual towns, and form a major theme of late medieval history.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; leaves King Henry I of England without a clear heir. After he dies the Anarchy begins: his daughter, Maud, and his nephew, Stephen of Blois, fight for the throne. Ambitious nobles and churchmen take sides, hoping to gain advantages. The novel, which is divided into a prologue and six sections, explores themes of intrigue and conspiracy, against a background of historical events. It explores the development of medieval architecture, the civil war, secular/religious conflicts, and shifting political loyalties.

===Prologue (1123)===
A red-headed man is hanged for theft after being condemned by a priest, a knight, and a monk. His pregnant lover curses the men who condemned him, declaring that their children will be hanged, their enemies will prosper, and that they will live the rest of their lives with regret and sorrow.

===Part One (1135–1136)===
Circumstances leave mason Tom Builder and his family destitute and starving. After his pregnant wife Agnes dies in childbirth, Tom abandons his newborn by his wife&#x27;s grave in the snowy woods, having no way to feed the infant. He later has a change of heart and returns, but finds the baby missing. After meeting up with an outlaw named Ellen and her son Jack, whom they had met earlier, the group discovers that Tom&#x27;s infant has been taken to a monastery cell belonging to the Kingsbridge Priory. Knowing that he will be charged with abandonment if he says the baby is his, and confident that the monks will be able to look after him, Tom decides to leave the infant to the monastery. After several unsuccessful attempts to find work, Tom convinces Bartholomew, Earl of Shiring, to hire him to repair the walls of the Earl&#x27;s castle.

Philip, the leader of the cell, is visited by his brother Francis, a priest, who warns him of a plot by Earl Bartholomew and the Earl of Gloucestershire against King Stephen. Philip tells Waleran Bigod, the ambitious archdeacon to the Bishop of Kingsbridge, of the plot, and travels to Kingsbridge Priory where the previous manager, Prior James, has died only a few days before. Waleran promises to make Philip the bishop&#x27;s nomination for prior, practically guaranteeing Philip&#x27;s election, in return for Philip&#x27;s support to later make Waleran bishop though Waleran conceals that the bishop is also already dead. Philip agrees as the priory has become financially and spiritually destitute under Prior James, and he believes he can correct that. He wins, making enemies of the rivals for the post, in particular the sub-prior Remigius. Tom&#x27;s infant, now named Jonathan, is sent to live with Philip at the priory.

Unsure of the validity of Philip&#x27;s words, Waleran goes to the Hamleighs, a noble family who have been enemies of the Earl of Shiring ever since the earl&#x27;s daughter, Aliena, rejected a marriage with William, the only son of the Hamleighs. Seeing this as an excuse for them to take their revenge, the Hamleighs take Bartholomew&#x27;s castle and arrest the earl, forcing Tom and Ellen, now lovers, and their children into homelessness once again. They eventually settle in Kingsbridge, Tom hoping to get a job rebuilding the cathedral there. The family sees Jonathan during this time, although only Tom and Ellen know that he is Tom&#x27;s son. To ensure that Tom will have work, Jack burns down the old Romanesque cathedral, telling no one else of his actions. After some convincing, Philip hires Tom to build the new cathedral.

Tom&#x27;s strong son Alfred physically bullies smaller and weaker Jack through repeated acts of battery which creates friction with Ellen as Tom sees no fault in his son and never disciplines him. Brother Remigius, who is opposed to Philip as prior, charges Ellen and Tom with fornication. Waleran, who was cursed by the woman at the hanging, orders Ellen to live apart from Tom. Outraged by Tom&#x27;s willingness to accept this, Ellen returns to the forest with Jack.

===Part Two (1136–1137)===
Philip and Waleran go to King Stephen in the hope of convincing him to give Bartholomew&#x27;s estates, including a huge limestone quarry, to the church, so that they can be used to pay for the new cathedral&#x27;s construction. Initially believing that Waleran will be loyal to him as a fellow cleric, Philip learns from the Hamleighs that Waleran intends to use the earldom solely to boost his own position. Realising that the Hamleighs are trying to divide him and Waleran so that they can take the earldom for themselves, Philip secretly conspires with the Hamleighs. They agree that Kingsbridge Priory will be given the quarry and some other lands with the rest of Shiring going to the Hamleighs, but the Hamleighs betray this deal and are given ownership of the quarry with Philip getting rights to, not ownership of, the stone. Furious at being foiled, Waleran vows to never let Philip build his cathedral.

Finding her still living in Shiring Castle, William attacks Aliena and her brother Richard. He mutilates the boy to coerce Aliena into not resisting as he rapes her brutally. This leaves Aliena traumatized. Homeless and destitute, Aliena and Richard travel to Winchester in the hope of receiving compensation from the king, and visit Bartholomew, now dying in prison. The former earl demands they swear an oath to work to regain the earldom. Aliena supports Richard financially by becoming a wealthy wool merchant (by, as described in the book, the hitherto unheard-of act of buying wool from the farmers on their farms and selling it at market rather than the farmers having to travel to market themselves, saving them time and effort) with the help of Philip, who agrees to buy her wool at a fair price when other merchants refuse to do so, and the two siblings settle in Kingsbridge.

The Hamleighs attempt to barricade the quarry against the priory, but Philip foils them by having his quarrymen travel there under the protection of the monks. The Hamleighs&#x27; men at arms retreat, fearing damnation if they do violence to the churchmen, leaving the quarry available for Philip&#x27;s use. In retaliation, the Hamleighs work with Waleran to try to have the cathedral moved to Shiring, thus depriving Philip of the properties tied to it, by claiming that Kingsbridge lacks the resources and manpower to build a cathedral. At the advice of his allies, Philip calls across the county for volunteers to work on the cathedral as penance for their sins. On the day of an inspection by Bishop Henry of Blois that Waleran had arranged, they arrive en masse, and Henry is convinced to not move the cathedral.

===Part Three (1140–1142)===
William&#x27;s father, Percy Hamleigh, dies, and William learns that the earldom will either go to him or Richard, now a knight, since they are both sons of an Earl of Shiring. Prior to the quarry, William destroys a mill and murders a miller in a village in front of Arthur and the townsfolk to provide fear and control of the serfs and villagers. In order to restore his fortunes so that he can raise an army with which to impress King Stephen, William leads an attack on the quarry, which the Hamleighs had unsuccessfully attempted to barricade against Philip, killing and expelling the priory&#x27;s quarrymen. Philip travels to Lincoln to attempt to persuade King Stephen to redress this outrage, but is interrupted by the Battle of Lincoln, where the king is captured by Robert of Gloucester. Philip is also captured by Robert&#x27;s forces but is released by his brother Francis, who is chaplain to Robert. Francis gets Philip an audience with the Empress Maud, who grants him a license for a market at Kingsbridge, while William Hamleigh, who has switched sides from Stephen to Maud, is granted sole right to the disputed quarry. Philip, despite the quarry being thus denied him, still manages to pay for stone for his cathedral using the revenues from the market.

Tom befriends Prior Philip and, when Ellen returns, he persuades Philip to allow them to marry. After some time, Alfred proposes to Aliena, but she turns him down. She also strikes up a friendship with Jack, with whom she falls in love, now working as an apprentice mason at Tom&#x27;s suggestion, but she shuns him after Alfred catches the two of them kissing, being reminded of William&#x27;s attack on her. The two stepbrothers continue to be at odds, and Alfred later claims that Jack&#x27;s father was hanged for thieving, starting a fight that leads to damage and a loss of construction materials. Jack is expelled from the cathedral construction, but Philip contrives a new construction overseer position for Jack that he can have, on the condition that he becomes a monk. Jack reluctantly agrees to this, in order to stay in Kingsbridge. Later on, Ellen claims that Jack&#x27;s father was innocent.

William proves a hapless and merciless lord who mishandles the earldom financially and routinely rapes any peasant woman he wishes. Attempting to restore his fortunes, William leads an attack that burns down Kingsbridge and kills many people including Tom Builder. In the chaos, Aliena&#x27;s entire stock of wool, in which she had invested all her money, is destroyed in the fire.

===Part Four (1142–1145)===
After losing her fortune again, Aliena agrees to marry Alfred if he supports Richard. Jack, who has been confined for continued infringements (largely fraternizing with Aliena) breaks his confinement in an attempt to talk to her, but is ultimately locked in the obedience room of the monastery. The next morning, Ellen breaks into the room, revealing that Jack&#x27;s father had once been imprisoned there after he was framed for theft by three men. Freed by his mother, Jack and Aliena make love on the morning of her wedding, and he tries to convince her to leave Kingsbridge with him, but she refuses to do anything that would require her to break her vow to support Richard. Jack attempts to persuade Alfred to call off the marriage, but discovers that Alfred plans to marry her solely to keep her from Jack, and intends to mistreat her to further spite him. Ellen curses the wedding, seemingly leaving Alfred impotent, and he and Aliena never consummate their marriage. Jack leaves Kingsbridge to find out about his father.

After years of putting off the decision following the death of Earl Percy Hamleigh, Stephen finally gives the earldom to William. Alfred persuades Philip to replace the wooden roof of the cathedral with a stone vault, but fails to reinforce the structure at the higher levels. This causes the cathedral to collapse during a service, killing many people. Aliena gives birth to a red-headed son, and Alfred abandons her, having realised that the child is Jack&#x27;s. On Ellen&#x27;s advice, Aliena leaves with her son to find Jack, and follows evidence of Jack&#x27;s sculpture through France and Spain, finding him in Paris, where they reconcile. Jack helps to calm a riot at a nearby cathedral using the &quot;Weeping Madonna&quot;, a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary he was given by a spice merchant he befriended that appears to weep when taken from a hot place to a cold place. The statue is viewed as a miracle, which Jack leverages for financial support to rebuild the cathedral in Kingsbridge.

As he travels home, Jack makes his way to Cherbourg where he is mistaken for the ghost of his father, Jacques Cherbourg, before meeting his grandmother and other relatives, who reveal that Jacques had supposedly died in the sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot;, of which he was a passenger. Returning to Kingsbridge, Jack convinces Philip and the clergy to make him the cathedral&#x27;s new master-builder, drawing up a new design for the cathedral based on his observations in France and Spain. His relationship with Aliena is discovered by the monks during the negotiations, and Philip orders them apart until Aliena&#x27;s marriage to Alfred is annulled.

Wanting more information on his father, Jack questions Ellen, who has continuously kept the truth from him out of fear that he would devote himself to a life of revenge against those responsible for his father&#x27;s death. She implies that the &quot;White Ship&quot; was sunk deliberately, reveals that the three men who framed Jacques Cherbourg were Percy Hamleigh, Waleran Bigod, and Prior James. After Jack visits Waleran to seek confirmation of Ellen&#x27;s words, William, jealous of Jack&#x27;s relationship with Aliena, convinces Waleran to let him attack Kingsbridge again, in order to kill Jack in a way that would avoid drawing attention to his accusations. Richard overhears fighters discussing the attack in another town, and his warning allows the villagers to build a set of town walls and earthen ramparts in about two days, thanks to the expertise of Jack. Fighting from the walls, the townspeople kill many of the attackers and repel William&#x27;s attack, while making it impossible for him to raid Kingsbridge again. As revenge, William asks Waleran to block Alfred and Aliena&#x27;s annulment. Though disheartened, Jack and Aliena agree to stay together, living separately (and occasionally making love in the forest) until the day they can marry.

===Part Five (1152–1155)===
Many years of famine pass, which are further exacerbated by William&#x27;s poor leadership. Alfred has left Kingsbridge for Shiring, but following a downturn in business, he returns to Kingsbridge and begs for a job from Jack. William&#x27;s mother dies, and after he forgets to summon the priest to give her last rites, the guilt-stricken William is persuaded by Waleran to build a cathedral in Shiring for the sake of his mother&#x27;s soul. They are later aided by Alfred, who brings all of the Kingsbridge workmen to Shiring in return for being in charge of the cathedral&#x27;s construction after Philip is unable to keep paying them.

Inspired by Aliena, Richard organises the starving peasants who have turned to outlawry into a militia, and goes to war with William, robbing him on multiple occasions. William learns of the location of Richard&#x27;s forces from Remigius, in return for making the monk the head of Shiring&#x27;s future chapter, and plans an overwhelming attack to kill all the rebels. When he arrives, he learns from Ellen that Richard&#x27;s men have left to join the forces of Maud&#x27;s son, the future Henry II of England, who has invaded the country on the advice of Francis.

Eventually, Stephen agrees to have Henry succeed him. Philip learns that as part of their deal, all properties will revert to the owners who held them prior to Stephen&#x27;s reign, thus making Richard the official earl, but Stephen will not have to force the handovers, meaning that Richard might not gain the earldom until Stephen&#x27;s death. With the help of William&#x27;s young wife, who loathes him, Aliena is able to allow Richard to capture the earldom&#x27;s castle before Henry and Stephen&#x27;s treaty can be made official and the King&#x27;s Peace restored. William returns to the village of Hamleigh, and Waleran proposes to sell him the position of sheriff of Shiring so that he can oppose Richard and keep funding the cathedral. Remigius is abandoned by the two of them during this time, but Philip forgives him for his treachery and allows him to return to the priory.

Richard refuses to grant the priory access to the quarry, on the basis that it was once part of the earldom. After Aliena calls him out for his ingratitude towards Philip, she is attacked and nearly raped by Alfred, who is out of work again after Shiring Cathedral is abandoned. Richard arrives and kills Alfred in the ensuing fight with Aliena&#x27;s assistance. Seeing a chance to regain the earldom, William obtains a warrant to arrest Richard for murder on the king&#x27;s behalf. Realising that Richard has no chance of a fair trial due to the attitudes towards marital rape of the time period and the hostility of both William and Stephen towards him, Philip proposes that Richard, who is more suited to be a soldier than an earl, fight in the Crusades as penance for killing Alfred; William would be unable to arrest him, and Aliena would be allowed to look after her brother&#x27;s lands, therefore giving the earldom both a competent ruler and one willing to cooperate with the priory. Aliena and Jack marry within the new cathedral.

===Part Six (1170–1174)===
After many years, Kingsbridge cathedral is completed. Waleran still seeks to ruin Philip, and accuses him of fornication by claiming that Jonathan, now a well liked and committed monk, is Philip&#x27;s son. With Philip&#x27;s conviction certain due to a lack of evidence proving his innocence, Jack and Jonathan attempt to figure out the identity of the latter&#x27;s father, both being unaware that he is Tom&#x27;s son. They discover the truth when Jonathan recalls that he had been found near the monastery cell that Philip once ran, a fact that had previously been unknown to Jack, who then remembers seeing the baby Jonathan lying on his mother&#x27;s grave. The two of them manage to convince Ellen, who has remained bitter towards Philip for his role in splitting up her and Tom, to testify on his behalf.

At Philip&#x27;s trial, Ellen&#x27;s testimony saves him from being convicted. Regardless, Waleran accuses Ellen of perjury, and she exposes his own perjury in the framing of Jacques Cherbourg, revealing that Waleran and the others had been bribed to dispose of him. Remigius confirms her testimony, having heard Prior James confess to his perjury shortly before the latter&#x27;s death. He explains that James&#x27;s misrule of the Priory had been the result of the guilt he felt for his part in the conspiracy, and admits that he had sought to become Prior to repair the damage, before admitting that Philip was better suited for the task. Waleran ultimately loses his position as bishop of Kingsbridge as a result of the revelations.

Later on, William and Waleran become involved with the plot to assassinate Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in order to protect their now crumbling positions of power. William leads the attack, and despite the efforts of Philip, who had traveled to Canterbury to meet with Becket, the archbishop is brutally murdered. Upon seeing the distraught congregation, Philip is inspired to treat Becket&#x27;s death as a martyrdom, and urges the assembled people to spread word of the murder across Christendom. With King Henry refusing to defend Becket&#x27;s killers, William is subsequently convicted of sacrilege by the efforts of both Philip and Tommy, the son of Jack and Aliena, and hanged.

At Kingsbridge, Jack meets with a ruined and repentant Waleran, now living as a monk in the priory, to learn why his father was framed. The former bishop explains that a group of barons had arranged the sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; in order to kill the king&#x27;s son and heir, with the belief that they would be able to influence the succession and gain more independence from the crown as a result. After they learned that Jacques Cherbourg had survived the sinking, the barons had him imprisoned in England to prevent him from exposing their conspiracy. While initially content to leave him there, they eventually chose to have him killed after he learned English and started attracting unwanted attention, hiring Waleran, Percy, and James for this end. Finally understanding the truth behind his father&#x27;s death, Jack is able to put it behind him. Elsewhere, the Pope forces King Henry&#x27;s public repentance and symbolic subjugation of the crown to the church, in which Philip, now Bishop of Kingsbridge, participates. In this final scene, Philip muses that the affair has proven the limitations of Royal power; the King could order Becket killed, but faced with the massive popular reaction he had to bow down and let himself be humiliated.

==Historical accuracy==
While the book has been praised for its description of medieval life, it also features some historical inaccuracies. Some of these might be to make the characters and the plot more suited for modern readers while some are clear anachronisms:
* One of the characters is called Francis, as is an imaginary person when Philip is lying to Waleran Bigod in Chapter 2, ii. It is unlikely that anybody in England would bear this name fifty years before the birth of Francis of Assisi. Indeed, Francis (from Old French &quot;Franseis&quot;, &quot;Franceis&quot;) was the saint&#x27;s nickname, while his Christian name was Giovanni (John). The name became widespread only due to the saint&#x27;s fame.
* Shareburg could not have been anglicized as such, because in the Norman pronunciation of the modern town Cherbourg, the &quot;Cher-&quot; element was and is pronounced [tʃɪr- / tʃɪl-] or [tʃɛr-] and was the same in Anglo-Norman. [tʃ] would have been retained in Middle English as well. [ʃɛr-] is Modern French. In the Old and Middle English and Anglo-Norman documents, Cherbourg is mentioned with different spellings from the 11th to the 15th century : &quot;Kiæresburh&quot; (1091, &quot;Anglo-Saxon chronicle&quot;), &quot;Chirburg(h)&quot;, &quot;Chierebour&quot;, &quot;Cheerebourg&quot;, &quot;Chierbourg(h)&quot;, &quot;Ch(i)erburg(h)&quot;, &quot;Chierbourc&quot;, &quot;Chirbourg(h)&quot;, &quot;Chirburt&quot;, &quot;Chireburgh&quot;, etc. The Parisian-French pronunciation was later adapted into English in the form &quot;Shearburg&quot; and is not mentioned before 1663.
* The English nobility of that period were Norman immigrants, together with other continental nationalities such as Bretons, Frenchmen (Paris and Île-de-France), Flemish and Angevin people. Anglo-Norman was the language of the court and upper class and it did not spread far into the rest of the English society. The ability of ordinary Englishmen to speak French was considered unusual, but Thomas Becket&#x27;s parents for example, who did not belong to the nobility, were traders and immigrated to England from Normandy and they were not the only ones. Thus, many of the encounters across social classes presented in the book have been characterized as implausible by some critics, although in fact bilingualism was then emerging in English society for practical and mercantile reasons. For example, the noblewoman Aliena (presumably a native Norman French-speaker) becomes a successful wool merchant, communicating with the Anglo-Saxon-speaking locals and running a successful business among them. As evidenced by the contemporary Peterborough Chronicle, English was still essentially pure Anglo-Saxon without the intermixture of French elements which would later create Middle English.
* Significantly, Tom and Ellen are rebuked for perpetrated fornication, and give the excuse that there was no priest at hand. Yet the diriment impediment &quot;lack of form&quot; dates back to no earlier than the Council of Trent, and clandestine marriages were only forbidden by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. The contemporary practice (as treated, for instance, by St. Thomas, S. th. Supp. 45) would have well made it possible for them to marry at once, without a priest, possibly taking their children as witnesses. Even more significantly, unmarried couples were fairly common throughout medieval society, and while the social standing of the woman would have been somewhat lowered by being a &quot;concubine&quot; and not a married woman, the fact itself carried no social stigma and scarcely provoked any intervention by law and church.
* Follett depicts Toledo, in medieval Spain, as a country with no wheat, supposedly due to a lack of proper flat terrain to cultivate it. In reality, the Kingdom of Castile&#x27;s plains, to which Toledo belonged, were famous for their extensive wheat fields.
* Agnes gives birth under a big horse-chestnut tree, but this species is native to the Balkans and was only introduced to England in the 16th century.
* Tom tries to find a hibernating squirrel &quot;in the dead leaves on the forest floor […] to put in the broth. He was unlucky.&quot; Squirrels found in the UK do not hibernate, although they are known to be lethargic in times of deep cold. (These would have been red squirrels in medieval times.)
* Sugar is mentioned several times in the book. Sugar was not available in England at that time, except in courtly circles: &quot;It is reported that the household of Henry III was using sugar in 1264, but not until 1319 was sugar in more general use in Britain.&quot; 
* The priory storeroom is said to contain hops, which were not used in Britain for food production until centuries later.
* Many people in the book are reported as having breakfast, though there is some debate on whether people in those times ate breakfast at all.
* In the novel a crate of glass wine bottles is mentioned, transported by boat from France. However, almost all wine was stored and transported in wooden barrels from the first century well into the twentieth century. Before that period, wine was transported in amphorae, wax-coated clay containers. Glass bottles were first introduced in the seventeenth century. The use of wine bottles was not common until the nineteenth century, after a machine was invented that manufactured identical bottles in the shape we know now.

==Adaptations==

===Board games===

Three separate board games have been developed that are based on &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;:
* A German-style board game by Michael Rieneck and Stefan Stadler was published in 2006 by Kosmos and released at the Spiel game fair as &quot;Die Säulen der Erde &quot;. The game sold out long before the fair ended. It has been awarded the 2007 Deutscher Spiele Preis, the Spanish &quot;Game of the Year 2007&quot; and the Norwegian &quot;Best Family Game of 2007&quot; and the GAMES Magazine &quot;Game of the Year 2007&quot;.
* A 2-player game was published by Kosmos in Germany and reprinted in the US as &quot;Pillars of the Earth: Builder&#x27;s Duel.&quot;
* A trivia game, attributed to E. Follett, was first published in 2008 by the British publisher Sophisticated Games.

<text>West Haddon is a village in West Northamptonshire, England about north-west of Northampton and east of Rugby and just off the A428 road which by-passes the village. The population of civil parish was 1,718 at the 2011 Census. The villages of West Haddon and Crick were by-passed by the A428 main road from Rugby to Northampton when the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT) was built in 1996 near junction 18 of the M1 Motorway, west of the village.

==History==
The name &#x27;Haddon&#x27; means &#x27;hill which is heathy&#x27;. ‘West’ to distinguish from East Haddon.

The fields of West Haddon were the location for an enclosure riot in 1765. An advertisement was made in the county newspaper for a football game that was to be played in those fields. The football game was a means to assemble a mob which tore down fences and burned them, protesting against the laws that were then being enacted that allowed wealthy landowners to lay claim to land that was once public land.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of 32 listed buildings in the parish of West Haddon, all of which are Grade II except for All Saints’ Church which is Grade I. These include:
*All Saints’ Church, High Street
*Redmoor House, Guilsborough Road – mid 17th-century farmhouse. 
*Brownstones, 2 High Street – former Vicarage, mainly built in the mid-18th century, with a 1612 datestone that may not be original.
*The Hall, 14 Station Road – an early 19th-century house with alterations made in 1946.

==Facilities==
It also has a General Stores and a Londis shop which incorporates a branch of the Post Office Ltd. There are two public houses, The Crown, which was recently refurbished and The Sheaf Inn, which re-opened in September 2018. The Pytchley Hotel is named after the local Pytchley hunt.

==Internet==
In 2003, a group of technology experts from the village and the village of Winwick grouped together to provide wireless internet for both villages, as British Telecom would not upgrade the local exchange to broadband internet. The system ran successfully until October 2004 when BT broadband was installed.

==Sport and activities==
The village has many provisions for sport, with two large playing fields, used for men&#x27;s football, at the north end of the village, a small children&#x27;s play area, a tennis court, a pétanque area, a cricket pitch with pavilion and car park, and links to numerous countryside paths, such as the Jurassic Way. In the middle of the village there is a bowls lawn.
West Haddon has many active sports clubs, such as a tennis club, bowls club, 3 senior football teams, several youth football teams, a cricket team, a bowls club a petanque club and a table tennis club.

West Haddon Players is a local amateur dramatics society founded in 1978.

==School==
The village&#x27;s primary school is West Haddon Endowed Church of England Primary School. Details of a series of reports on the school can be found in the relevant section of the Ofsted website. There were 201 pupils on the roll at the time of the inspection in January 2012.

Secondary school children in the village generally attend Guilsborough School in Guilsborough, Lawrence Sheriff School for Boys, Rugby High School for Girls or Rugby School.

==Notable residents==
* Marcia Williams - Baroness Falkender of West Haddon, former Private Secretary to Harold Wilson, Prime Minister.

<doc id="1194439" wikidata="Q4602755" url="?curid=1194439" title="Walgrave">
<text>Walgrave is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 822 people, increasing to 868 at the 2011 Census.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Old&#x27;s grove&#x27;. The village of Old is nearby and the main component is likely to be the same.

==Landmarks==
St Peter&#x27;s, a sandstone-spired church, is in the centre of the village. Throughout the autumn and winter, residents make donations to illuminate the church from 8.30pm. The west tower is 13th century, but the church is mostly 14th century. There is a monument to Mountague Lane, died 1670. Walgrave is part of a united benefice which also includes the parishes of Hannington, Old and Scaldwell with each village retaining its own church. In the mid-1950s, a walrus supposedly was living in one of the creeks near village, but was never captured.

The rectory, east of the church dates from 1687.

Up the road from St Peter&#x27;s is the 18th-century Baptist chapel. Although the Baptist church was founded before 1700, the present chapel was built in 1786 in typical Northamptonshire non-conformist style, being slightly wider than it is long. Built of the local brown limestone, with a gate guarded by two yew trees, it clashes a little with the attached brick-built Sunday School of 1899. The former graveyard has been converted into a garden area.

The remains of Walgrave Hall are in the north part of the village. The manor dates from around the 13th century. The hall had a tower on the left and then a lower wing. The remains of the hall are now sub-divided but the plast coat of arms of the Langham family remain with the date 1674. There is a fine staircase of c.1630.

==Annual Events==
Groove on the Green is an annually attended fundraiser event for the village fund and the small businesses that take part, often showcasing upcoming musical and comedy talent. The village also hosts open gardens where villagers get the opportunity to showcase their hard work.

==Village school==
Walgrave Primary School is in Kettering Road, Walgrave. Details of a series of reports on the school can be found in the relevant section of the Ofsted website. At the time of the inspection in March 2011 the number of pupils enrolled stood at 125.

==Football==
Walgrave is home to one of Northamptonshire&#x27;s oldest football teams. Formed in 1896, the club played in the Northamptonshire League (subsequently to become the United Counties League), the Kettering &amp; District Combination League, and more recently the Northants Central Combination League. In the last years of the 20th century, the club was forced to fold, and played for a while under the name Walgrave Royal Oak. After a gap of some 12 years, Walgrave Amber FC was reformed by David Rhodes. It formally re-affiliated with the Northants FA in 2007 and re-joined the Northants Combination League in time for the start of the 2008/9 season. The club&#x27;s original nickname, The Pipe Stems, has only recently been unearthed. Several Amber players have gone on to play professional football at the highest level, most notably Harry Walden who starred in Northampton Town&#x27;s rise from Division 4 obscurity to Division 1 between 1963 and 1966.

Walgrave Amber now plays its home games at the nearby new village of Mawsley, the facilities at the Walgrave Playing Field being no longer up to standard and the playing surface suffering a drainage collapse. Discussions regarding an upgrade of the changing rooms and renovation of the pitch are ongoing.

<doc id="1194442" wikidata="Q5928259" url="?curid=1194442" title="Huddersfield line">
<text>The Huddersfield line is the main railway line between the English cities of Leeds and Manchester, via Huddersfield. It is one of the busiest MetroTrain lines. The route travels south-south-west from Leeds through Dewsbury. After a short westward stretch through Mirfield, where it runs on the ex-L&amp;YR section, it continues south-west through Huddersfield, using the Colne Valley to its headwaters. The long Standedge Tunnel, just after Marsden, crosses under the watershed; the majority of the run down to Manchester is in the Tame Valley. From Manchester, some services continue to Manchester Airport and others to Liverpool.

In November 2011, the Government announced that this route would be electrified, to be completed by 2022; however, there have been multiple delays. It is currently subject to the Transpennine Route Upgrade, which is an element of the Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands that was announced in November 2021.

==History==

At the time of the 1923 Grouping, most of the route followed by the line was over London and North Western Railway (LNWR) metals; the exception was a short stretch around Mirfield, which was the property of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). The first section of the line, between Huddersfield and Stalybridge, was opened by the &quot;Manchester, Stockport and Leeds Railway&quot; on 1 August 1849. The line became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway after 1923.

The route was furnished with an additional two tracks in 1894, thus giving four tracks between Stalybridge and Leeds. The loss of traffic through the second half of the 20th century saw these cut back to just two lines and the closure of the Micklehurst (Friezland) loop.

The length of the line between Manchester Victoria and Holbeck Junction at Leeds is , though the Transpennine upgrade work covers the additional section to York which accounts for .

===Future===

From spring 2019, the whole route is being upgraded over the course of three control periods extending beyond 2029. Network Rail state that this will include doubling the track in some places and upgrading stations as well as some of the intended Transpennine north railway upgrade. The electrification was to have been curtailed in parts and, as such, the sections between Stalybridge and Huddersfield, with a further section of east of Leeds, was not to have been electrified. Emphasis was placed on the bi-modal power of the new trains using the line; this necessitated using diesel engines on the unelectrified sections of track.

In August 2019, Network Rail announced a proposal to upgrade the track between Huddersfield and Dewsbury from two tracks to four; at the same time, they also stated their intent to electrify the line between Huddersfield and Leeds. The plans were being put out for public consultation. In July 2020, the then Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, announced a £589 million upgrade to the line, including the reinstatement of an extra two tracks between Huddersfield and Thornhill Junction, to provide four tracks between the two points. These plans were submitted in April 2021 with the expectation of a decision on whether to proceed in 2023.

In March 2022, the first step in the Transpennine Route Upgrade programme was taken. A Transport and Works Act Order to begin works for electrification, track doubling in sections and station upgrades between Dewsbury and Huddersfield was submitted; approval was expected in early 2023. The TRU is an element of the Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands that was announced in November 2021. This proposal includes full electrification of the Huddersfield line and, as well as the track quadrupling between Huddersfield and Westtown (Dewsbury), a grade-separated junction at Thornhill L.N.W. Junction, close to Ravensthorpe.

==Route details==
Metro (West Yorkshire) pre-paid tickets and concessionary fares are available between Leeds and Marsden. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) fares are available for the Greenfield-Manchester section. Several of the intermediate stations listed were closed in the 1960s, as a result of the Beeching Axe, including many of those between Huddersfield and Manchester.

* Manchester Piccadilly

==Services==
TransPennine Express (TPE) operate the majority of the passenger services over the line, as it is the core line linking the North West with Yorkshire and the North East. Since privatisation in the 1990s, local services on the route have been operated by the Northern franchise (Arriva Trains Northern, Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North and, since 2020, Northern Trains). The first incarnation, Arriva Trains Northern, also operated the express services between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, York, Middlesbrough and Newcastle before the Strategic Rail Authority spun the express train services off into a separate franchise operated by First TransPennine Express and, since 2016, by TransPennine Express.

At the May 2018 timetable change, the Northern services calling at the smaller stations on the section between Greater Manchester and Huddersfield were transferred to TPE; they were combined into an hourly to service. This also saw many of the TPE services diverted away from the to Manchester Piccadilly corridor, so that through trains could use the newly opened Ordsall Chord. However, Northern still operate local services from Huddersfield to Sheffield, Leeds (via ) and Wakefield. Due to the change of line on the through Manchester services, the Liverpool trains no longer run on the line through , but travel via instead.

Six trains per hour provided by TPE in both directions run on the Huddersfield line between in Greater Manchester and Leeds:
* to (via )
*Liverpool Lime Street to (via Manchester Victoria)
* to Newcastle (via Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria)
*Manchester Airport to (via Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Victoria)
*Manchester Piccadilly to 
*Manchester Piccadilly to 

==Ale trail==
An &quot;ale trail&quot; has become popular along the route owing to a large number of easily accessed and nationally acclaimed pubs along the route; this includes pubs on the station platforms at Dewsbury, Huddersfield and Stalybridge. The following are of particular interest:

* &quot;West Riding Licensed Refreshment Rooms&quot;: located on the platform at Dewsbury station, 2006 runner up CAMRA National Pub of the Year)
* &quot;The Kings Head&quot;, formerly known as &quot;The Station Tavern&quot;, in the east wing of Huddersfield station
* &quot;The Head of Steam&quot;: in the west wing of Huddersfield station
* &quot;The Commercial&quot;, &quot;The Shoulder of Mutton&quot; and &quot;The Hideaway Crafthouse&quot; in Slaithwaite
* &quot;Riverhead&quot;, Marsden: with the Riverhead Brewery in the basement, in the town a little down from the station and tunnels
* &quot;Station Buffet&quot; at Stalybridge: an original Victorian station buffet with marble counter, on the platform at Stalybridge station)

The trail featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Oz and James Drink to Britain&quot; programme and consequently became very popular for drinkers in Manchester and Leeds. This has prompted some concerns over anti-social behaviour in the villages along the trail.

<text>Upper Catesby is a hamlet in the civil parish of Catesby, Northamptonshire, about southwest of Daventry. The hamlet is about above sea level, at the top of a northwest-facing escarpment. The population is included in the civil parish of Hellidon.

==Archaeology==
In 1895 during the sinking of a shaft for Catesby Tunnel a Roman cinerary urn was found about south of Upper Catesby.

==Village==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;farm/settlement of Katr/Kati&#x27;.

In 1389 Upper Catesby was recorded as &quot;Overcatsby&quot;. It is a shrunken village. The modern hamlet has only a handful of 19th- and 20th-century houses, but is surrounded by numerous earthen features showing where cottages and the main village street had been. Most of the fields around the former village still have clear ridge and furrow marks from the ploughing of the medieval arable farming with an open field system divided into narrow strips.

==Catesby House==
Catesby House is a Jacobethan country house about west of Upper Catesby. It was built in 1863 and enlarged in 1894. It includes 16th-century linenfold panelling said to come from Catesby Priory, and 17th-century panelling, doorcases and a stair with barley-sugar balusters, all from the previous 17th-century Catesby House that was in Lower Catesby.

==Catesby Tunnel==
Catesby Tunnel is a disused railway tunnel on the route of the former Great Central Main Line. It passes about west of Upper Catesby and about east of Catesby House. The tunnel&#x27;s north portal is about northwest of the hamlet, and its south portal is about north of Charwelton, just inside the southern boundary of Catesby parish.

<doc id="1194444" wikidata="Q1101402" url="?curid=1194444" title="Cuvier (crater)">
<text>Cuvier is a lunar impact crater on the southern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is attached to the east-southeast rim of the unusually shaped formation Heraclitus. To the northeast is the crater Clairaut.

The rim of this crater has been worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving an outer wall that has been rounded and diminished in prominence. There is a small but notable crater pair lying across the northern rim, and two other smaller craters lie along the east and south rims. There are also several small craterlets lying across the rim to the north-northwest. Where the rim is shared with Heraclitus, there is a slight inward bulge to the wall, producing a short section where the rim appears slightly flatter.

The interior floor is level and nearly featureless, and much of the floor appears to have been resurfaced. This surface does not possess the low albedo characteristic of the lunar mare, and it matches the hue of the surrounding terrain. Instead, the floor is marked by faint traces of ray material from elsewhere.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cuvier.

<doc id="1194445" wikidata="Q2724168" url="?curid=1194445" title="Aulus Platorius Nepos">
<text>Aulus Platorius Nepos was a Roman senator who held a number of appointments in the imperial service, including the governorship of Britain. He was suffect consul succeeding the &quot;consul posterior&quot; Publius Dasumius Rusticus as the colleague of the emperor Hadrian for March to April 119 AD.

Anthony Birley notes that Nepos&#x27; career &quot;in two important respects was an unusual one for a governor of Britain. In the first place, it is the only example recorded before the time of Severus Alexander of a man who had begun his career in the least favored post in the vigintivirate, the &quot;tresviri capitales&quot;, later receiving an emperor&#x27;s backing in his candidature for a higher post... Secondly, this is only one of three known instances (the others being those of L. Flavius Silva (&quot;ord&quot;. 81) and C. Bruttius Praesens (II &quot;ord&quot;. 139) of such men proceeding to the consulship after a single senior praetorian appointment.&quot;

== Life ==
It is unclear where he was born and raised, but because he was explicitly described as a friend of the emperor Hadrian before his accession, and both share the same tribe (Sergia), Birley states that it is &quot;not improbable&quot; that Nepos came from Southern Spain; he notes that the nomen Platorius is attested in Baetica. In the final years of the 1st century Nepos served as a military tribune with Legio XXII Primigenia at Mainz under the eye of the governor of Germania Superior, who brought him to the attention of Trajan, who, in turn, directly supported his candidacy for senatorial offices. Nepos likely became praetor in 111, then curator of the three roads in Etruria in 112 and 113 before becoming legate of Legio I Adiutrix during Trajan&#x27;s Parthian campaigns. Upon Hadrian assuming the imperial throne, Nepos was made governor of Thracia, then suffect consul in the spring of 119. Shortly afterwards he was made governor of Germania Inferior, and while governor received Hadrian during his tour in 121. He accompanied Hadrian to Britain in 122, when he was made governor of that province, and oversaw the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. He probably brought Legio VI Victrix with him from the continent to assist in the construction and perhaps to replace Legio IX Hispana which had left around 108. His tenure as governor of Roman Britain is securely dated by two military diplomas, one dated to 17 July 122, and the other to 15 September 124.

Nepos sought no further office after his time in Britain. Bricks bearing his name, and dated to 134, show he owned a brickworks near Rome. At some point Nepos held the augurate. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; twice records how Hadrian came to dislike his old friend, which Birley attempts to explain, for the &quot;Historia&quot; is considered an unreliable source. Birley suggests that A. Platorius Nepos Calpurnianus, curator of the Tiber in 161, was his son.

<doc id="1194448" wikidata="Q536896" url="?curid=1194448" title="Terry McDermott">
<text>Terence McDermott (born 8 December 1951) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Nicknamed &quot;Terry Mac&quot;, he is best known as a member of the Liverpool team of the 1970s and early 1980s, where he won three European Cups and five First Division titles. Either side of his time at Anfield, he played for Newcastle United, with his second stint seeing him reunite with former Liverpool teammate Kevin Keegan. Internationally, he was capped 25 times for England, and was part of the UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 FIFA World Cup squads.

McDermott has had an extensive coaching career, returning to Newcastle to be Keegan&#x27;s assistant manager, and would be kept on following Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s appointment as manager. He joined Celtic in 1999 to be John Barnes&#x27; assistant. McDermott returned to Newcastle again to be one of Graeme Souness&#x27; assistants and remained with the club until 2008, which included a short reunion with Keegan. He then became Lee Clark&#x27;s assistant at Huddersfield Town and Birmingham City.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
McDermott joined Bury as a youngster in 1969. He made a total of 90 appearances and eight goals before joining Newcastle United in 1973. Manager Joe Harvey gave McDermott his Newcastle debut on 17 March 1973, at Old Trafford against Manchester United. He came off the bench but could not do anything to prevent Newcastle losing 2–1.

McDermott reached the FA Cup final in 1974 against Liverpool. However, Newcastle lost the match 3–0.

===Liverpool===
Liverpool boss Bob Paisley, in his first season in charge after replacing Bill Shankly, brought McDermott to Merseyside in November 1974. McDermott made his Liverpool debut on 16 November, as did Phil Neal, in a Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park. Neither side could break the deadlock with both sides sharing the points. McDermott&#x27;s first goal came in a 1–1 league draw with Burnley at Turf Moor on 8 March 1975.

For the next two years, McDermott struggled to get into the team or hold down a place once given his chance. Liverpool won the League championship and the UEFA Cup in the 1975–76 season but McDermott did not play in enough matches to pick up a League medal, although he was in the squad which won in Europe. Speculation mounted that he would move on in the summer of 1976, but instead he stayed at Anfield and became an integral part of the following season&#x27;s triumphs.

McDermott was a fixture in the 1977 side that retained the title. Meanwhile, his goal against Everton in the semi-final of the FA Cup, a turn and chip from the edge of the penalty area, was voted the &quot;Goal of the Season&quot; by the BBC. That game finished 2–2, with Liverpool winning the replay. A subsequent success in a European Cup semi-final meant that Liverpool had reached the finals of both the FA Cup and European Cup, which were scheduled to be played respectively at Wembley and at Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico within four days of each other in May 1977. However, Liverpool were defeated in the FA Cup final by Manchester United, which ended their &quot;treble&quot; dream. There was joy for McDermott four days later, though, when he opened the scoring in the European Cup final against Borussia Mönchengladbach as Liverpool won 3–1.

On 6 December 1977, he scored a hat-trick in the second leg of Liverpool&#x27;s victory over Hamburg in the UEFA Super Cup Final.

Liverpool reached their first League Cup final in 1978 and this occasion was to prove memorable for McDermott for the wrong reasons. The first game at Wembley against Nottingham Forest ended goalless, but McDermott had a goal disallowed after the officials decided that Kenny Dalglish was in an offside position when McDermott struck his shot. In the replay at Old Trafford, after Forest had opened the scoring with a hotly disputed penalty, McDermott scored what he thought was the equaliser with a well-struck drive, only for the officials to deny him again, claiming he had controlled the pass with his arm. Forest held on to win 1–0 and McDermott offered to swear on oath in an after-match interview that he had trapped the ball legally with his chest.

Consolation at missing out on the League Cup was found at the end of the season when McDermott featured in the Liverpool team which retained the European Cup thanks to a 1–0 win over Club Brugge at Wembley.

The following season, McDermott scored one of Liverpool&#x27;s most memorable goals. It came at Anfield in a League match against Tottenham Hotspur on 2 September 1978. Liverpool were defending a corner which was cleared from their own penalty area to striker David Johnson, who hit a long pass to the sprinting winger Steve Heighway on the left flank as McDermott started to chase forward. Within just a few seconds, the ball was in the Spurs net as Heighway raced down the line and crossed the ball, without stopping to control it, for McDermott to head home after a 70-yard run. This was the final goal in a 7–0 win.

By the end of that season, McDermott and Liverpool were champions again and they retained the title in 1980, with McDermott being voted the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year - the first player to win both awards in the same season. He scored another memorable goal against Tottenham that season, this time in the FA Cup at White Hart Lane, when he took a misplaced pass from Osvaldo Ardiles on the right hand corner of the penalty area, flicked the ball into the air and hit a lob-volley into the far corner of the goal.

In 1981, McDermott featured as Liverpool beat West Ham United after a replay to win the League Cup for the first time. Later that season, he appeared in the team that defeated Real Madrid in the European Cup final. A further League title and League Cup followed in 1982 but his place in the side was becoming less assured.

===Later career===
McDermott returned to Newcastle United in September 1982. At Newcastle, he featured alongside his former Liverpool teammate Kevin Keegan, and youngsters Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley, as Newcastle won promotion back to the top flight of English football in 1984. McDermott left Newcastle in January 1985 and moved abroad to play with Cork City in Ireland.

From 1985 to 1987, McDermott played for the Cypriot club APOEL, alongside Ian Moores, where he won the Cypriot Championship and the Cypriot Super Cup.

==International career==
On 7 September 1977, Ron Greenwood gave McDermott his debut for England in a 0–0 friendly draw with Switzerland at Wembley Stadium. He opened his goalscoring account on 10 September 1980 during a World Cup qualifier at Wembley against Norway. McDermott scored twice, including a penalty, as England won 4–0.

McDermott was selected for the England squad which travelled to the 1980 European Championships in Italy. He played in two of the group games. McDermott was also picked for the England squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain but did not play, despite having featured in every qualifying game. He never played for England again and only featured as a substitute in one match for Liverpool the following season.

In his England career, he had been capped 25 times at senior level, and scored three goals.

==Coaching career==
When Kevin Keegan became manager of Newcastle on 5 February 1992, he recruited McDermott as his first team coach. Together, the two masterminded a return to the top of the English game for Newcastle, which included a close run to the League title in 1996, eventually won by Manchester United. After Keegan resigned, McDermott stayed at Newcastle for a further season under Kenny Dalglish. He left the club when Dalglish resigned and his successor Ruud Gullit decided to bring in his own coach.

When John Barnes was appointed as head coach of Celtic on 8 June 1999, he appointed McDermott as assistant head coach alongside Eric Black, before they were all sacked following the Scottish Cup defeat by Inverness Caledonian Thistle in February 2000.

In 2005, McDermott returned to Newcastle after he was recruited by manager Graeme Souness to work as a coach. After the sacking of Souness in February 2006, McDermott stayed on under managers Glenn Roeder, Sam Allardyce and Keegan once again. When Keegan quit in September 2008, McDermott also left, along with Adam Sadler.

On 19 December 2008, McDermott was named assistant manager of League One side Huddersfield Town, effectively becoming Lee Clark&#x27;s right-hand man. Following the sacking of Clark in February 2012, McDermott was also sacked. In June 2012, he joined Birmingham City as Clark&#x27;s assistant. On 17 February 2014, it was widely reported that he and first-team coach Derek Fazackerley had left Birmingham; this was later confirmed by the club.

==Personal life==
McDermott&#x27;s sons Neale and Greg also played football, formerly on the books of Gateshead. He also has a daughter named Rachel.

On 22 August 2021, he announced that he had been diagnosed with dementia.

<text>Thornby is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. It has a Manor house. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 162 people, increasing to 189 at the 2011 Census. The village is bisected by the A5199 (formerly A50) road between Northampton and Leicester and about north-west of Northampton town centre. It is about 1½ miles (2½ km) south of a junction with the A14 road which joins the M1 Motorway and M6 junction at Catthorpe with Felixstowe, Suffolk.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;farm/settlement with thorn trees&#x27;.

==Notable buildings==
The parish church is dedicated to St. Helen and is described by Pevsner as &quot;of little architectural interest&quot;. It dates from the 14th century and additions and re-building took place in 1870 by E F Law.

Thornby Hall is located off Naseby road and carries 17th century, with 19th- and 20th-century additions, for its Tudor style. The house and grounds were used as a school for young people with severe emotional and behavioural problems, as a result of attachment difficulties which may have been rooted in early life trauma. It is now closed and been sold. In 2017, Thornby Hall became home to Nagarjuna Kadampa Meditation Centre, a Kadampa Buddhist community and public meditation centre.

Stone House is c. 1700 and Thornby Grange was built in 1911 in the Stuart style.

<text>A hawker centre (), or cooked food centre (), is an often open-air complex commonly found in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. They are intended to provide a more sanitary alternative to mobile hawker carts and contain many stalls that sell different varieties of affordable meals. Tables and chairs are usually provided for diners.

Such centers are typically managed by a governing authority that maintains the facility and rents out stalls for hawkers to sell their goods.

==By countries or regions==
===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, most cooked food centres (熟食中心; or cooked food markets, 熟食市場) are either located in market complexes of residential districts, or as a standalone structure (this being the case in most industrial areas), with only a few exceptions (e.g. Mong Kok Cooked Food Market is located in the lower levels of Langham Place Hotel). Cooked food centres are managed by Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.

Most of the stalls from hawker centres are converted from former dai pai dong (cooked food stalls) by strict regulations and management; the Hong Kong Government regarded the provision of cooked food centres as a way to eliminate traditional dai pai dongs from local streets in the 1970s. During the industrial boom in the 1960s and 1970s, the government also built cooked food markets in industrial areas to serve the catering needs of the working class in major industrial centres such as Kwun Tong, Tsuen Wan and Fo Tan.

Stalls in cooked food centres usually provide local cuisine, with those selling exotic delicacies a minority.

While many cooked food centres in Hong Kong are open-air, many others are indoor air-conditioned complexes, owing to Hong Kong&#x27;s periods of extreme humidity.

===Malaysia===

During the 1950s, the British were concerned about the economic influence of the hawkers and kept them under surveillance. In response to the government&#x27;s plan to curb the activities of the Kuala Lumpur Hawkers and Petty Traders Association, its members threatened to take up arms and participate in the Malaysian Emergency against the government, leading the latter to back down. 

In the next decade, the association became part of the system and actively promoted the hawkers&#x27; interests where necessary. By the 1960s, however, the authorities began to crack down on illegal activities and unlicensed hawkers. Health and safety considerations also became paramount to the authorities as the hawkers had little sanitary considerations and frequently occupied the streets with their wares, even after being fined.

In 1967, the first two hawker centers in Malaysia were built in Kuala Lumpur as part of a programme to improve hygiene standards and clear the roads of streetside stores. While initially reluctant, the hawkers eventually moved to these facilities. However, many continue to operate in other areas, with operation in hawker centres being one of seven types of hawker licences issued by Kuala Lumpur.

In the state of Penang, most hawkers were also moved into fixed locations as hygiene and traffic concerns grew. Some temporary or mobile fixtures remain, however licences to do so can only be renewed, with no new licences for mobile hawking being offered. Moving to fixed locations is often unpopular with hawkers, who fear losing customers and the higher fees needed. Labour shortages in the 1980s and 1990s led to many hawker centres being staffed by foreigners. In 2014, after it was reported that in 68 hawker centres 119 foreign cooks were identified, a law banning foreign cooks was proposed and gathered support, finally being passed in 2016. This was purported as a move to protect Penang&#x27;s heritage, and 13 dishes were declared by the government as heritage dishes; 10 were of Chinese origin, 2 of Tamil origin, and 1 of Malay origin. Foreigners were still able to work as assistants, or as cooks in restaurants.

Cooks working in hawker centres are mainly older individuals, challenging the sustainability of the business. Hawking is viewed, including by many hawkers, as low-status and low-paying. The COVID-19 pandemic led to further challenges. The Penang government pledged to restore the Gurney Drive hawker centre, considered the most well-known, which had previously relied on both domestic and international tourists. Overall business in Penang&#x27;s hawker centres decreased by 50%, as national regulations limited their opening hours.

===Singapore===

Hawker centres sprang up in urban areas following the rapid urbanisation in the 1950s and 1960s. In many cases, they were built partly to address the problem of unhygienic food preparation by unlicensed street hawkers. In Singapore today, besides hawker centres, there are also increasing numbers of food courts, which are indoor, air conditioned versions of hawker centres located in shopping malls and other commercial venues.

In the 1950s and 1960s, hawker centres were considered to be a venue for the less affluent. They had a reputation for unhygienic food, partly due to the frequent appearance of stray domestic pets and pests. Many hawker centres were poorly managed by their operators, often lacking running water and proper facilities for cleaning. More recently, hygiene standards have improved, with pressure from the local authorities. This includes the implementation of licensing requirements, where a sufficient standard of hygiene is required for the stall to operate, and rewarding exceptionally good hygiene. A score of 85% or higher results in an A, and the lowest grade is a D, which ranges from 40 to 49% passing standards. These grades are required to be displayed on hawker stands. Upgrading or reconstruction of hawker centres was initiated in the 1990s in Singapore.

In 1987, a point demerit system was introduced to account for stand&#x27;s food and personal handing hygiene. Six demerit points yield a US$400 fee (HK$2470). Individual fines will be solicited for larger violations such as putting unclean materials in contact with the food. Failure to display issued license will result in a US$200 fine.

The hawker centres in Singapore are owned by three government bodies, namely the National Environment Agency (NEA) under the parent Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), Housing and Development Board (HDB) and JTC Corporation. All the centres owned by HDB and NEA, in turn, are regulated by NEA with the individual Town Councils managing the HDB owned centres. JTC owned centres are self-managed.

In 2011, Singapore announced plans to develop 10 hawker centres, which equates to 600 stalls in the next decade. It was expected to stabilise food prices and reduce rent of hawker stalls over time.

As of 2016, two Singaporean food stalls, both located in hawker centres, became the first street food vendors to be awarded a Michelin Star for excellence in eating. The two stalls are Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle. (Unfortunately, Hawker Chan lost its star in 2021, so only one hawker in Singapore currently has a Michelin Star.) As of 2019, more than 40 hawker stalls were awarded Michelin Star and Bib Gourmand in Singapore. In 2023, they already constituted the majority of the list.

In 2019, Singapore submitted its nomination to inscribe its hawker culture on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Inscription was announced on 16 December 2020, when UNESCO described the hawker centre as &quot;‘community dining rooms’ where people from diverse backgrounds gather and share the experience of dining over breakfast, lunch and dinner.&quot;

With effect from 1 September 2021, it is an offence to leave behind food trays, crockery, used tissues, wet wipes, drink straws, food wrappers, drink cans, plastic water bottles, food remnants and any other litter at hawker centres. First-time offenders will be issued a written warning. Second-time offenders will face a composition fine of SGD$300 and subsequent offenders may face court fines under the Environmental Public Health Act.

====Urban Hawker (New York City)====
On September 21, 2022, a Singaporean-style hawker centre opened in Manhattan, New York City. It was first mooted in 2013 by American chef Anthony Bourdain after visiting Singapore, and he collaborated with Singaporean chef K.F. Seetoh. Seetoh took up the mantle after Bourdain&#x27;s death in 2018. Known as the Urban Hawker, it consists of traditional Singaporean dishes, with most of the vendors hailing from Singapore.

=== Indonesia ===

In Surabaya, various hawker centers called &quot;Sentra Wisata Kuliner&quot; (abbreviated as SWK; ) were established. &quot;Sentra Wisata Kuliner&quot; are areas that provide various food dishes consisting of several small stalls or stands from culinary street vendors. The government of Surabaya has made culinary street vendors (&quot;pedagang kaki lima&quot;) a tourist destination so that their image may change for good.

<text>Frederick James Kimball (March 6, 1844 – July 27, 1903) was a civil engineer. He was an early president of the Norfolk and Western Railway and helped develop the Pocahontas coalfields in Virginia and West Virginia.

==Railroad career==
At 18, he went to work for the Erie Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad as a rodman, a menial worker. After a short time, he went to England for two years, where he worked for English railroads. Upon returning to the United States, he quickly moved up the ranks of railroading jobs. In 1870, he became a partner in E. W. Clark &amp; Co., a private Philadelphia financial firm. In 1878, Kimball became the prime mover behind the construction of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, which was building up the Shenandoah Valley.

In 1881, the Clark firm bought at auction the foreclosed Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), an east-west railroad across Virginia controlled by William Mahone. Kimball, who was a partner in the Clark firm, headed the new line, which was renamed Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, and consolidated it with the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. For the junction for the Shenandoah and the Norfolk &amp; Western, Kimball and his board of directors selected a small Virginia village called Big Lick, on the Roanoke River. The small town was later renamed Roanoke, Virginia. The lines were expanded from just over 500 miles of track to one of over one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-two miles in 1903, the year when Kimball died.

Under Kimball, the Norfolk &amp; Western became famous for manufacturing steam locomotives in-house at its Roanoke shops. Kimball, whose interest in geology was responsible for the opening of the Pocahontas coalfields in western Virginia and West Virginia, pushed N&amp;W lines through the wilds of West Virginia, north to Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio, and south to Durham and Winston-Salem, North Carolina. This gave the railroad the route structure it was to use for more than 60 years.

In 1885, several small mining companies representing about (1,600 km2) of bituminous coal reserves grouped together to form the coalfields&#x27; largest landowner, the Philadelphia-based Flat-Top Coal Land Association. Norfolk and Western Railway bought the Association and reorganized it as the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Co., which it later renamed Pocahontas Land Corp., now a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern.

Transported by the N&amp;W and neighboring Virginian Railway (VGN), Pocahontas coal fueled half the world&#x27;s navies during the 20th century and today stokes steel mills and power plants all over the globe.

Kimball died in 1903, and is buried in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was succeeded as president of the Norfolk and Western Railway by Lucius E. Johnson.

==Legacy==
A request was made to rename the town of Big Lick, now Roanoke, in his honor, but Mr. Kimball turned it down. Kimball Avenue in Roanoke, Virginia, was named in his honor. A decorative fountain in downtown Roanoke was named for him and dedicated in 1907. The rail station Kimball, just north of the town of Luray, VA was originally named after F.J Kimball, but the name was later changed to Elgin to eliminate confusion with another station. Kimball Road in Luray still bears his name though.

Abstract: The Norfolk and Western Railroad was organized in 1881, growing directly out of the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad. Primarily a line carrying agricultural products at its inception, the Norfolk and Western rapidly became associated with coal transportation and with the mineral development of Southwest Virginia and West Virginia. In 1881 it acquired the franchises to four companies: the New River Railroad, the New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company, the Bluestone Railroad, and the East River Railroad. These became the basis for the Norfolk and Western&#x27;s New River Division, which ran to the coal fields of the southwestern part of Virginia and West Virginia. In the 1890s the Norfolk and Western continued to expand and grow, but was forced to go into receivership in 1895, to emerge in 1896 as the Norfolk and Western Railway Company. The records include directors&#x27;, stockholders&#x27;, officers&#x27; and committee minutes; stock ledgers; real estate ledgers showing property owned; treasurer&#x27;s letter books and statements; unclaimed wages; advances on payroll; construction expenditures; arbitration correspondence and record books; executive correspondence, reports, subject files, and contracts of George F.

<text>Gerald Wayne Grote (October 6, 1942 – April 7, 2024) was an American professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball from 1963 through 1981 for the Houston Colt .45s, New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Kansas City Royals.

After playing for Houston from 1963 to 1964, Grote played for the Mets from 1966 to 1977. With the Mets, he was a two-time All-Star player and was a member of the team that became known as the Miracle Mets for their upset victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series. He finished his career with the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978 and the Royals and Dodgers in 1981. Grote was considered to be one of the best defensive catchers of his era. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Early life==
Grote was born on October 6, 1942, and was raised in San Antonio, Texas. When he was ten years old, he and his family were caught in an F-4 tornado. His mother, father, and two sisters made it to safety, however, his grandmother died in the storm.

Grote attended Douglas MacArthur High School, where he played on the baseball team as a pitcher, catcher, and third baseman. As a high school pitcher, he threw a no-hitter and a one hitter. Grote attended Trinity University in 1962, and played college baseball for the Trinity Tigers. He led the Tigers in batting average (.413), home runs (five), runs batted in (RBIs; 19), runs scored (29), and hits (31).

==Professional career==

===Houston Colt .45s===
After one season at Trinity University, Grote was signed as an amateur free agent by the Houston Colt .45s in 1962, and was assigned to play for their minor league affiliate, the San Antonio Bullets. At the age of 20, he made his major league debut with the Colt .45s on September 21, 1963 as a late-inning defensive replacement for John Bateman, and hit a sacrifice fly to score Bob Aspromonte in his only plate appearance. For the season he appeared in three games, including on September 27, when every starter in the Colts&#x27; line-up was a rookie.

In 1964, Grote platooned with Bateman at catcher; however, the Colts also experimented with young catchers Dave Adlesh and John Hoffman, as neither Grote nor Bateman hit for a very high average that season (.181 and .190, respectively). Grote was the Colts&#x27; catcher on April 23, when Ken Johnson became the first pitcher in major league history to lose a complete game no-hitter in nine innings.

In 1965, the newly renamed Houston Astros remained unsettled behind the plate, with former All-Star Gus Triandos and prospect Ron Brand being added to the roster. Grote spent the entire season with Houston&#x27;s Triple-A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, where he batted .265 with eleven home runs. At the end of the season, he was traded to the New York Mets for pitcher Tom Parsons.

===New York Mets===
Grote became the Mets&#x27; starting catcher in 1966. Though he batted only .237 with three home runs in his first season with the Mets, his handling of the Mets&#x27; young pitchers and his solid defensive skills were instrumental in helping the Mets avoid 100 losses and a last place finish for the first time in franchise history. Grote earned a reputation with his teammates and opponents as highly competitive, developing the trademark of rolling the ball to the far side of the pitcher&#x27;s mound (closest to the Mets&#x27; dugout) while leaving the field after his pitcher ended an inning with a strikeout. This necessitated the opposing team&#x27;s pitcher having to walk further to stoop and retrieve the ball.

In 1968, Grote was hitting over .300 at mid-season and was recognized as one of the top catchers in the Nationàl league when he was selected to be the starting catcher in the 1968 All-Star Game. He became only the second Met player in franchise history after Ron Hunt to earn a starting role in an All-Star game. Grote was hitless in two at-bats during the game. He ended the year with a .282 batting average along with three home runs and 31 RBIs.

In the 1969 season, the Chicago Cubs had been in first place since the beginning of the season and had a nine-game lead as late as August 15. However, the Cubs began to falter while the Mets continued to play well. When the two teams met for a two-game series on September 8, the Mets won both games to move just a half game behind the Cubs. Aside from calling Tom Seaver&#x27;s five-hit pitching performance in the second game, Grote drove in the Mets&#x27; seventh and final run of the game. The following day, the Mets swept the Montreal Expos in a doubleheader, with Grote catching all 21 innings. Coupled with a Cubs loss, the Mets moved into first place for the first time in their history. The Mets stayed in the lead for the rest of the season, finishing with a 37–11 record in their final 48 games while the Cubs slumped to a 9–17 record in their final 26 games, and clinched the National League East division title on September 24.

Grote finished the 1969 season with a .252 average and career-highs with six home runs and 40 RBIs, but it was his defensive skills that proved most valuable for the Mets. Grote posted a .991 fielding percentage and his 56.3% caught stealing percentage was second-best among National League catchers. He was also credited with guiding a Mets young pitching staff that led the league in victories and shutouts and finished second in team earned run average.

The Mets swept the Atlanta Braves in the 1969 National League Championship Series, but were considered heavy underdogs heading into the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. Following a 4–1 loss in the series opener with Cy Young Award winner Seaver on the mound, the Mets bounced back, winning the next four games to capture their first world championship. Besides catching every inning in the postseason, Grote contributed offensively with a single in Game Two to keep a ninth inning rally alive; Al Weis followed with the game-winning hit. With Game Four tied, Grote doubled to start the tenth inning, then pinch runner Rod Gaspar scored the winning run when an errant throw hit J.C. Martin on the wrist. With Grote calling the pitches, the Mets pitching staff held the Orioles hitters to a .146 batting average against during the series.

Grote led National League catchers in putouts and in range factor in 1970 and 1971. In 1972, Grote played in only 64 games due to injuries and in late September he had surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow.

In May 1973, Grote broke a bone in his right arm when he was hit by a pitch and went on the disabled list for two months. When he returned in mid-July, the Mets began winning, climbing from last place on August 30 to win the National League Eastern Division. They then proceeded to defeat the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds in the 1973 National League Championship Series. In the World Series, the Mets took the Oakland Athletics to the seventh and final game, before they were defeated. As he had in 1969, Grote caught every inning of every post-season game for the Mets in 1973. Looking back on his two pennant-winning seasons with the Mets, Grote said, &quot;It (the 1969 season) was no miracle. Now, &#x27;73 was a miracle.&quot;

In 1974, Grote was batting .287 with four home runs and 27 RBIs when he earned his second All-Star selection. Injuries began to take their toll and he split catching duties with Duffy Dyer. Grote rebounded in 1975, posting a career-high .295 batting average in 119 games and led all National League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage. At Veterans Stadium on July 4, 1975, Grote stepped in as a pinch hitter against longtime teammate Tug McGraw, who had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies during the off-season. With the Mets down 3–2, Grote connected for a game-winning two-run home run.

===Los Angeles Dodgers and Kansas City Royals===
In August 1977, the Mets traded Grote to the Los Angeles Dodgers for two players to be named later. Shortly after joining the Dodgers, Grote struck out in his only career at-bat against former battery-mate Tom Seaver, who was now with the Reds. During his two seasons with the Dodgers, he played part-time as a backup to Steve Yeager and appeared in two World Series against the New York Yankees. He retired from professional baseball after the 1978 season.

In 1981, the Kansas City Royals, who were experiencing a shortage of catchers, lured Grote out of retirement. On June 3, at the age of 38, Grote went 3-for-4 with a grand slam, a double, and a stolen base, driving in a team-record seven runs. He recorded 17 hits in 56 at bats (.304) in 22 games for the Royals before they placed him on release waivers on September 1. He signed with the Dodgers and appeared in one game for them before the end of the season. Grote retired again after the 1981 season.

==Career statistics==
In a 16-year major league career, Grote played in 1,421 games, accumulating 1,092 hits in 4,339 at bats for a .252 career batting average along with 39 home runs and 404 RBIs. He ended his career with a .991 fielding percentage, which at the time of his retirement was eighth highest all-time among catchers. On April 22, 1970, Grote set a major league record with 20 putouts in a game when Tom Seaver threw 19 strikeouts against the San Diego Padres. He is the Mets all-time leader in games played as a catcher (1,176). Grote caught 116 shutouts in his career, ranking him 15th all-time among catchers.

Grote called the pitches for some of the most outstanding pitchers of his era, including Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, Nolan Ryan, Tommy John, Don Sutton, and Dan Quisenberry. He possessed a strong and accurate throwing arm against opposing baserunners. Hall of Fame inductee Lou Brock found Grote to be one of the most difficult catchers on which to attempt a stolen base, and though Hall of Fame catcher Johnny Bench was the perennial Gold Glove winner during their careers in the National League together, Bench once said of Grote, &quot;If Grote and I were on the same team, I would be playing third base.&quot;

==Post retirement and honors==
After his playing career had ended, Grote went into business selling meat, but the business closed. In September 1983, he was indicted by a grand jury for hindering a secured creditor when he sold cattle that did not officially belong to him. The charges were dropped in May 1984.

Grote spent 1985 as manager of the Lakeland Tigers and the Birmingham Barons. In 1989, he played for the St. Lucie Legends in the Senior Professional Baseball Association. He was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, and the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1992. In 1998, he was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame. On October 8, 2011, Grote was inducted into the Trinity University Athletic Hall of Fame.

Grote appeared as a Mystery Guest on the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. Grote and some of his teammates with the 1969 Mets appeared on an episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; in 1999.

In 2010 and 2011, Grote was color commentator with Mike Capps on the Round Rock Express radio home broadcasts.

==Personal life==
Grote and his first wife, Sharon, divorced in 1980. He married his second wife, Toni, in May 1982 and they divorced in July 1983. He had three children with his first wife – Sandy, Jeff, and Jennifer.

On April 7, 2024, Grote died from respiratory failure at the Texas Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute in Austin, Texas. He was 81.

<text>The Sierra Network (TSN), later rebranded as the ImagiNation Network (INN), was an online service launched in 1991 by Sierra On-Line. First developed in 1989 and launched to the public in 1991, it offered subscribers a unique online space to play games and socialize, billing itself as a &quot;cyberspace theme park.&quot; This service was the first exclusively focused on online gaming and was among the early adopters of online avatars, laying the groundwork for future gaming communities.

==History==
TSN was conceived by Ken Williams, co-founder of Sierra On-Line, who saw potential in expanding the gaming experience beyond single-player adventures to a more social, interactive medium. This vision led to the creation of The Sierra Network (TSN) in 1991, a pioneering platform enabling real-time interactions and gameplay among users across different locations.

Previously, Williams had released a modem-supported helicopter flight simulator, showcasing his early fascination with multiplayer gaming. Additionally, he took an interest in Prodigy, an early online service, which he called a &quot;preview of the future.&quot; Prodigy stood out as the first platform to integrate text with an easy-to-use graphical user interface and wide-ranging content designed for a diverse and mainstream audience.

Williams initially proposed an innovative device: &quot;The Constant Companion&quot;, envisioned as a compact unit that could be connected to a television, similar in appearance to conventional video game systems. It was designed to be straightforward, requiring only a power source and a telephone line connection, with a built-in modem facilitating its operation. The goal was to market this device at an accessible price point of approximately $99, employing a business strategy where the initial sale would cover hardware costs, with the primary revenue coming from monthly or hourly subscription fees.

NEC initially collaborated with Williams, supplying the necessary computers and equipment to develop a prototype for the Constant Companion. However, as discussions about manufacturing the device progressed, NEC&#x27;s interest in the project diminished. In response, Sierra redirected its strategy to enhancing the device&#x27;s gaming content and making the Constant Companion accessible to a wider audience, specifically targeting individuals with personal computers. At that point, the program was rebranded as &quot;The Sierra Network&quot;, a change thought to broaden its appeal and leverage the recognition of the Sierra On-Line brand.

The technical execution of this idea fell to Jeff Stephenson, Sierra&#x27;s lead system programmer, who faced the task of developing a new programming language specifically for online gaming. The result, an online-enabled version of Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter, aimed to address the unique challenges of supporting multiple players in an online environment and creating an intuitive user interface.

In developing The Sierra Network, Williams prioritized simplicity to ensure the platform was accessible to a broad audience, especially those new to online gaming. His objective was to create an environment where users, regardless of their gaming experience, could easily navigate and engage with the content. As a result, TSN was designed with a user-friendly interface and launched with a variety of well-known games, such as bridge.

The company expanded and rented additional office space in Oakhurst within a building previously known as The Old Barn, a restaurant with a rustic Wild West theme. This building, recognizable by its water tower, would later be featured in the game&#x27;s home screen. 

By November 1992, the company had invested $10 million in developing the service, aiming for 50,000 members by March 1993.

==Features and games==

Unlike many services available at the time, TSN differentiated itself by utilizing a graphical interface to enhance the visual appeal of online interactions, as opposed to the prevalent text-based interfaces. The platform supported both multiplayer and single-player games, and it promoted social interactions through the creation of avatars and the ability for users to form guilds or clubs. TSN also introduced online shopping features, exploring a concept that was relatively uncommon in digital services of that era. In other words, TSN was &quot;tragically ahead of its time&quot;.

Inspired by Disneyland&#x27;s themed lands, Williams envisioned The Sierra Network as a digital theme park with distinct areas, aiming to create a space that vertically targeted different audiences and interests. 

* The Town Hall: Offered administrative services, including billing details and an events calendar.
* The Mall: The Mall initially offered physical copies of Sierra games and branded T-shirts via mail-order. The aim was to eventually evolve into a digital distribution platform for Sierra games.
* The Post Office: Allowed members to send and receive email.
* The Clubhouse: Provided access to traditional games such as chess, checkers, bridge, and backgammon.
* SierraLand: All-ages experiences with games like miniature golf, paintball, the Red Baron flight simulator, and Graffiti, a program for drawing and creativity.
* LarryLand: Catered to adults with a theme park inspired by the Leisure Suit Larry series, offering casino games and a virtual bar for socializing. The platform encourages playful interactions like electronic kisses, under the watchful eye of system operators to maintain appropriate conduct.
* The Shadow of Yserbius: A role-playing game set in Mount Yserbius&#x27; dungeons, filled with monsters and puzzles. It combined traditional RPG elements like turn-based combat and character development, paving the way for future online games with its mix of gameplay and social interaction.

TSN also introduced FaceMaker, a tool allowing members to design a virtual &quot;face&quot; or avatar for their online identity. These avatars, which could be seen during games or chats, offered customization options for gender, age, and style, enabling users to tailor their digital representation to their preferences. The style of avatars could also change depending on the area of The Sierra Network being accessed. The modular design was inspired by Mr. Potato Head. FaceMaker was among the first instances of customizable avatars, a concept that would quickly become a staple in online platforms.

==Pricing==
In June 1992, TSN introduced a new flat rate pricing model, starting at $12.95 for up to 30 hours of service each month. At the time, this approach was regarded as a significant long-term marketing strategy for the company. 

A central challenge was TSN&#x27;s high operational costs. The service predated the widespread consumer use of the internet. Users had to dial in through local telephone numbers, which then connected to TSN via Telnet. 
&quot;It was costing us more per hour to have customers online than what we were getting in revenue,&quot; said Williams.

By 1993, the pricing structure had evolved. A basic membership, priced at $12.95 a month, offered 30 hours of access during nights and weekends, but this was limited to Clubhouse games. Additional access to each of the three theme parks required an extra $4 per month. For broader access, packages could cost up to $150 a month, offering more playing time. These prices did not include the telephone charges required for connection, which could cost an additional $6.00 per hour. 

The need for a dial-up connection limited potential growth to users within the continental United States. Despite raising prices, the company was losing money rapidly and struggled to meet the initial goal of 50,000 subscribers.

==Partnership, divestiture and closure==

Faced with financial challenges from The Sierra Network (TSN), which was incurring significant losses without a clear path to profitability, Sierra opted for a strategic shift in 1993 by selling a 20% stake in TSN to AT&amp;T. This decision resulted in the renaming of the network to &quot;The ImagiNation Network&quot;. In 1994, AT&amp;T completed its investment by purchasing the remaining stake for $40 million, taking over network infrastructure and customer acquisition and billing process to address the operational challenges previously faced by Sierra. 

AT&amp;T planned to invest $5 million into developing new games for the platform. It also entered into an agreement to make ImagiNation accessible on Sega video game consoles. Furthermore, AT&amp;T officials expressed intentions to develop a version of a 3DO player that would include software for accessing the Sierra Network, indicating a strategy to expand and improve the network&#x27;s reach. However, the service struggled under the new corporate ownership, hampered by bureaucracy and attempts to overhaul its underlying code base. After several frustrating years, AT&amp;T sold the ImagiNation Network in 1996 to America Online. By 1998, the service was discontinued, concluding a significant chapter in the history of online gaming.

In a compelling alternate history, Bill Gates and Microsoft showed interest in purchasing The Sierra Network (TSN) concurrently with AT&amp;T&#x27;s initial investment. Gates felt let down when Sierra chose not to explore Microsoft&#x27;s proposal further, arguing that Microsoft&#x27;s bid would have been more advantageous for Sierra&#x27;s shareholders compared to AT&amp;T&#x27;s offer. He pointed out that Microsoft&#x27;s emphasis on online ventures was a better match for TSN&#x27;s direction than AT&amp;T&#x27;s wider-ranging strategy, suggesting a missed opportunity for a potentially more synergistic partnership.

<text>Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tale Classics, also known as Grimm Masterpiece Theater (グリム名作劇場 &quot;Gurimu meisaku gekijō&quot;) in the original version and The Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales (in Australia and New Zealand), is a Japanese anime anthology series by Nippon Animation based on the &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;.

== Premise ==
&quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tale Classics&quot; adapted several old favorites, taking liberties in some cases. The series also contains many obscure fairy tales, though some of these were removed from later reissues of the volume. Some were eliminated because they originated outside Germany, and therefore didn&#x27;t appear in the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s collection of stories, such as &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;, &quot;Bluebeard&quot; and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. &quot;The Worn-Out Dancing Shoes&quot; is instead based on a variation of the tale reported by the Brothers Grimm in the notes of the first edition of the book. Most of the tales were presented in one episode, while some stories in the first season were told over two or four episodes for a total of 41 fairy tales. Similar to &quot;Andersen Stories&quot; (1971), a green-haired female pixie was used as a framing device, though limiting herself to announce the titles and never getting involved with the plot.

The show comprises two series. The first series, known in Japan as , aired from October 21, 1987, to March 30, 1988, for a total of 24 episodes. The second series, known in Japan as , aired between October 2, 1988, and March 26, 1989, totaling 23 episodes. Both series were produced by Nippon Animation with the cooperation of Asahi Broadcasting Corporation in Osaka. It was also localized under the series&#x27; English name.

The fairy tale anthology was broadcast in the United States by Nickelodeon, in local stations throughout Europe, Latin America, Philippines, Israel, Arab World, New Zealand and Australia.

== Music ==
In Japan, for both seasons, the series used two theme songs; the opening theme, , and the ending theme, , were both performed by Ushio Hashimoto. Incidental music used in the Japanese version was composed by Hideo Shimazu. The theme tune and incidental music used in the English dub were both composed by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy. Most of the incidental music was in fact recycled from the earlier VHS series &quot;My Favorite Fairy Tales&quot;.

The rights to the English dub (owned by The Walt Disney Company following their purchase of Fox Family Worldwide in 2001) reverted to Nippon Animation on July 19, 2005 (series 1) and March 31, 2006 (series 2).

Discotek Media acquired the rights to release the series on SD-BD. The first volume was released on May 25, 2021, and the second volume was released on August 31 the same year. The releases included both the original Japanese versions of the episodes, along with the English dubs by Saban Entertainment, reconstructed using video from the Japanese version and audio from the dub masters. The Season 1 release included alternative English versions of &quot;The Travelling Musicians of Bremen&quot;, &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, and &quot;The Naughty Spirit&quot;. The Season 2 release included the English versions of &quot;The Crystal Ball&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Mrs. Fox&quot;, &quot;The Old Woman in the Woods&quot;, &quot;The Faithful Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Mother Holle&quot;, &quot;The Six Swans&quot;, &quot;The Spirit in the Bottle&quot;, &quot;The Iron Stove&quot;, &quot;The Water Nixie&quot;, and &quot;The Godfather of Death&quot;, which had never aired in North America. The Season 1 episode &quot;The Six Who Went Far&quot; is incorrectly titled &quot;The Six Who Went Too Far&quot; in the Discotek release.

Season 1 of the English dub is available on Amazon Prime in the USA.

<doc id="1194470" wikidata="Q7912772" url="?curid=1194470" title="Value of information">
<text>Value of information (VOI or VoI) is the amount a decision maker would be willing to pay for information prior to making a decision.

==Similar terms==
VoI is sometimes distinguished into value of perfect information, also called value of clairvoyance (VoC), and value of imperfect information. They are closely related to the widely known expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and expected value of sample information (EVSI). Note that VoI is not necessarily equal to &quot;value of decision situation with perfect information&quot; - &quot;value of current decision situation&quot; as commonly understood.

==Definitions==

===Simple ===

A simple example best illustrates the concept: Consider the decision situation with one decision, for example deciding on a &#x27;Vacation Activity&#x27;; and one uncertainty, for example what will the &#x27;Weather Condition&#x27; be? But we will only know the &#x27;Weather Condition&#x27; after we have decided and begun the &#x27;Vacation Activity&#x27;.
:* The Value of perfect information on &quot;Weather Condition&quot; captures the value of being able to know &quot;Weather Condition&quot; even before making the &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; decision. It is quantified as the highest price the decision-maker is willing to pay for being able to know &quot;Weather Condition&quot; before making the &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; decision.
:*The Value of imperfect information on &quot;Weather Condition&quot;, however, captures the value of being able to know the outcome of another related uncertainty, e.g., &quot;Weather Forecast&quot;, instead of &quot;Weather Condition&quot; itself before making &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; decision. It is quantified as the highest price the decision-maker is willing to pay for being able to know &quot;Weather Forecast&quot; before making &quot;Vacation Activity&quot; decision. Note that it is essentially the value of perfect information on &quot;Weather Forecast&quot;.

===Formal ===

The above definition illustrates that the value of imperfect information of any uncertainty can always be framed as the value of perfect information, i.e., VoC, of another uncertainty, hence only the term VoC will be used onwards.

====Standard ====

Consider a general decision situation having &quot;n&quot; decisions (&quot;d1&quot;, &quot;d2&quot;, &quot;d3&quot;, ..., &quot;dn&quot;) and &quot;m&quot; uncertainties (&quot;u1&quot;, &quot;u2&quot;, &quot;u3&quot;, ..., &quot;um&quot;). Rationality assumption in standard individual decision-making philosophy states that what is made or known are not forgotten, i.e., the decision-maker has perfect recall. This assumption translates into the existence of a linear ordering of these decisions and uncertainties such that;

:*&quot;di&quot; is made prior to making &quot;dj&quot; if and only if &quot;di&quot; comes before &quot;dj&quot; in the ordering
:*&quot;di&quot; is made prior to knowing &quot;uj&quot; if and only if &quot;di&quot; comes before &quot;uj&quot; in the ordering
:*&quot;di&quot; is made after knowing &quot;uj&quot; if and only if &quot;di&quot; comes after &quot;uj&quot; in the ordering

Consider cases where the decision-maker is enabled to know the outcome of some additional uncertainties earlier in his/her decision situation, i.e., some &quot;ui&quot; are moved to appear earlier in the ordering. In such case, VoC is quantified as the highest price which the decision-maker is willing to pay for all those moves.

====Generalized ====

The standard then is further generalized in team decision analysis framework where there is typically incomplete sharing of information among team members under the same decision situation. In such case, what is made or known might not be known in later decisions belonging to different team members, i.e., there might not exist linear ordering of decisions and uncertainties satisfying perfect recall assumption. VoC thus captures the value of being able to know &quot;not only additional uncertainties but also additional decisions already made by other team members&quot; before making some other decisions in the team decision situation.

==Characteristics==

There are four characteristics of VoI that always hold for any decision situation:

:*The value of information can never be less than zero since the decision-maker can always ignore the additional information and make a decision as if such information is not available.
:*No other information gathering/sharing activities can be more valuable than that quantified by value of clairvoyance.
:*Observing multiple new evidences yields the same gain in maximum expected utility regardless of the order of observation.
:*The VoI of observing two new evidence variables is not additive. Instead it is equivalent to observing one, incorporating it into our current evidence, then observing the other.

==Computation==

VoC is derived strictly following its definition as the monetary amount that is big enough to just offset the additional benefit of getting more information. In other words; VoC is calculated iteratively until

::&quot;value of decision situation with perfect information while paying VoC&quot; = &quot;value of current decision situation&quot;.

A special case is when the decision-maker is risk neutral where VoC can be simply computed as

::VoC = &quot;value of decision situation with perfect information&quot; - &quot;value of current decision situation&quot;.

This special case is how expected value of perfect information and expected value of sample information are calculated where risk neutrality is implicitly assumed. For cases where the decision-maker is risk averse or risk seeking, this simple calculation does not necessarily yield the correct result, and iterative calculation is the only way to ensure correctness.

Decision trees and influence diagrams are most commonly used in representing and solving decision situations as well as associated VoC calculation. The influence diagram, in particular, is structured to accommodate team decision situations where incomplete sharing of information among team members can be represented and solved very efficiently. While decision trees are not designed to accommodate team decision situations, they can do so by augmenting them with information sets widely used in game trees.

==Examples==

VoC is often illustrated using the example of paying for a consultant in a business transaction, who may either be perfect (expected value of perfect information) or imperfect (expected value of imperfect information).

In a typical consultant situation, the consultant would be paid up to cost &quot;c&quot; for their information, based on the expected cost &quot;E&quot; without the consultant and the revised cost &quot;F&quot; with the consultant&#x27;s information. In a perfect information scenario, &quot;E&quot; can be defined as the sum product of the probability of a good outcome &quot;g&quot; times its cost &quot;k&quot;, plus the probability of a bad outcome (1-&quot;g&quot;) times its cost &quot;k&quot;&#x27;&gt;k:

&quot;E&quot; = &quot;gk&quot; + &quot;(1-g)k&#x27;,&quot;

which is revised to reflect expected cost &quot;F&quot; of perfect information including consulting cost &quot;c&quot;. The perfect information case assumes the bad outcome does not occur due to the perfect information consultant.

&quot;F&quot; = &quot;g(k+c)&quot;

We then solve for values of &quot;c&quot; for which &quot;F&lt;E&quot; to determine when to pay the consultant.

In the case of a recursive decision tree, we often have an additional cost &quot;m&quot; that results from correcting the error, and the process restarts such that the expected cost will appear on both the left and right sides of our equations. This is typical of hiring-rehiring decisions or value chain decisions for which assembly line components must be replaced if erroneously ordered or installed:

&quot;E&quot; = &quot;gk&quot; + &quot;(1-g)(k&#x27;+m+E)&quot;

&quot;F&quot; = &quot;g(k+c)&quot;

If the consultant is imperfect with frequency &quot;f&quot;, then the consultant cost is solved with the probability of error included:

&quot;F&quot; = &quot;g(k+c)(1-f) + g(k+c+F)f + (1-g)(1-f)(k+c+F) + (1-g)f(k&#x27;+c+m+F)&quot;

VoI is also used to do an inspection and maintenance planning of the structures. analyze to what extent the value associated with the information collected during the service life of engineered structures, for example, inspections, in the context of integrity management, is affected by not only measurement random errors but also biases (systematic errors), taking the dependency between the collections into account

<doc id="1194473" wikidata="Q4983860" url="?curid=1194473" title="Bud Harrelson">
<text>Derrel McKinley &quot;Bud&quot; Harrelson (June 6, 1944 – January 11, 2024) was an American professional baseball shortstop, coach and manager. He played for the New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies and Texas Rangers from to . After his retirement as a player, he served as a coach for the 1986 Mets team that won the World Series, and as manager of the Mets in 1990 and 1991. He was a coach and part-owner of the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

Harrelson was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in . He was the only person to take part in both of the Mets&#x27; World Series championships and appear in the first three World Series for the team; he won in 1969 and appeared in the 1973 World Series as a player and in 1986 as a coach. Harrelson is also the only person in Mets history to have appeared in four playoff seasons: as a player in 1969 and 1973 and as a coach in 1986 and 1988.

==Early life==
Harrelson was born in Niles, California, on D-Day, June 6, 1944. His nickname of &quot;Bud&quot; came from his younger brother, who had trouble saying his name and instead called him &quot;brother&quot;, which was shortened to &quot;Bud&quot;. Harrelson was raised in Hayward, California, where he attended Sunset High School, graduating in 1962. He enrolled at San Francisco State University and, after one year, signed with the New York Mets as an amateur free agent in 1963.

==Playing career==
===New York Mets===
The Mets promoted Harrelson to the major leagues on September 1, 1965, and he made his debut with the Mets the following day. Harrelson anchored the Mets&#x27; infield for 13 seasons, including their championship season and pennant-winning season. Weighing only , Harrelson received the nicknames of &quot;Twiggy&quot;, &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mini Hawk&quot; from his teammates. Typical of shortstops of his era, Harrelson was a good fielder but poor hitter. He had a lifetime batting average of .236 and hit a total of seven home runs during his 15-year major league career, but had a lifetime .969 fielding percentage and won a Gold Glove Award at his position in . He was a National League All-Star in 1970 and 1971.

====Amazin&#x27; Mets====
On May 28, 1969, after a five-game losing streak that saw the Mets fall into fourth place in the newly aligned National League East, Harrelson hit an RBI single that won the game, beginning an 11-game team winning streak and a record of 82–39 over the rest of the season.

On September 10, the Mets jumped into first place for the first time in franchise history. On September 24, the team clinched the NL East with a 6–0 victory over Steve Carlton and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mets won 38 of their last 50 games and finished the season with 100 wins against 62 losses, eight games over the second-place Cubs. Harrelson batted .248 with no home runs, 24 RBI and 42 runs scored. He had a .969 fielding percentage in 119 games at shortstop.

====1969 postseason====
Harrelson&#x27;s two hits in the 1969 National League Championship Series against the Atlanta Braves included a go-ahead triple in the fourth inning of the first game and an RBI double in Game 2 of the Mets&#x27; three-game sweep.

====Fight with Pete Rose====
Harrelson&#x27;s light hitting became the subject of controversy during the 1973 National League Championship Series. Mets starter Jon Matlack held the Cincinnati Reds to two hits in his 5–0 complete game victory in Game 2 of the series at Riverfront Stadium. Following the game, Harrelson commented, &quot;He made the Big Red Machine look like me hitting today.&quot; Harrelson was confronted by Reds second baseman Joe Morgan during pregame warmups for Game 3 and warned that Pete Rose was unhappy with the quote.

In the fifth inning, Rose&#x27;s hard slide hard into second base sparked a bench-clearing brawl. The game was nearly forfeited when the Shea Stadium crowd threw objects at Rose, causing manager Sparky Anderson to remove the team from the field until order was restored. Mets manager Yogi Berra and players Willie Mays, Tom Seaver, Cleon Jones and Rusty Staub walked to left field to attempt to calm the fans.

===Phillies and Rangers===
After the Mets reacquired former #1 overall pick Tim Foli, Harrelson was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for Fred Andrews and cash on March 23, 1978. Rose and Harrelson became teammates with the Phillies but did not discuss the fight. The Phillies released Harrelson before the start of the 1980 season. Harrelson signed with the Texas Rangers in May after Rusty Staub broke a finger.

In , Harrelson was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.

==Post playing career==

After his retirement, Harrelson joined the Mets&#x27; coaching staff as a first-base coach and infield instructor for the 1982 season. During the 1983 season, Harrelson substituted for Steve Zabriskie as a broadcaster on 60 Mets games covered by WWOR-TV. Harrelson managed the Little Falls Mets in and was named the New York–Penn League manager of the year. He managed the Columbia Mets of the South Atlantic League in . When Mets third base coach Bobby Valentine accepted a managerial position with the Texas Rangers during the 1985 season, Harrelson replaced him on Davey Johnson&#x27;s coaching staff.

Harrelson was a coach with the Mets during their 1986 World Series championship season and replaced Johnson following his dismissal as Mets manager 42 games into the season. He led the Mets to their seventh consecutive winning season, finishing at 91–71. During the 1990 season, Harrelson hosted a WFAN radio show called &quot;The Bud Harrelson Report&quot; but ended it early in the 1991 season because Harrelson felt that some of Howie Rose&#x27;s questions were too negative.

Although the Mets were contenders for most of the first half of the 1991 season and were as close as 2.5 games behind the eventual division-winning Pittsburgh Pirates, the team collapsed in the second half and Harrelson was fired with a week remaining in the season and replaced by his third base coach Mike Cubbage. The Mets finished in fifth place at 77–84.

In 2000, Harrelson became part-owner of the Long Island Ducks, a newly formed independent league baseball team. He managed the Ducks in 2000, their inaugural season, and became a coach for Ducks home games in their second season. The Ducks retired Harrelson&#x27;s uniform number 3 in 2018.

==Personal life==
Harrelson married his first wife Yvonne on December 17, 1965. They later divorced, and Harrelson married Kim Battaglia in 1975. His children are Kimberly, Timothy, Alexandra, Kassandra and Troy Joseph. Harrelson was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the baseball category in 1992. He appeared as himself in a episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; along with several other members of the 1969 Mets. Harrelson resided in East Northport and Hauppauge, New York.

Harrelson was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2016 and publicly disclosed his diagnosis in 2018. He died at a hospice in East Northport, New York on January 11, 2024, at age 79.

<doc id="1194478" wikidata="Q3639999" url="?curid=1194478" title="Bill Sikes">
<text>William &quot;Bill&quot; Sikes is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists (alongside Monks) in the 1838 novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles Dickens. Sikes is a malicious criminal in Fagin&#x27;s gang, and a vicious robber and murderer. Throughout much of the novel Sikes is shadowed by his “bull-terrier” dog Bull&#x27;s-eye.

==Role in the novel==
Dickens describes his first appearance:
His girlfriend Nancy reluctantly tolerates, but is intimidated by, his violent behaviour. However, when he thinks Nancy has betrayed him, Sikes viciously murders her. After police identify him as travelling with a dog, Sikes attempts to drown Bull&#x27;s-eye to rid himself of his companion. In the end while trying to escape over the rooftops via a rope, a vision of the murdered Nancy&#x27;s eyes terrifies him into losing his balance, falling with the looped rope around his neck and accidentally hanging himself.

Sikes is a somewhat conflicted character. For instance, after preventing Nancy from keeping her midnight appointment with Rose Maylie and Mr Brownlow, he wondered aloud to Fagin if being indoors for so long in their dingy lodging was beginning to affect her after she dedicated the whole day caring for him. After he brutally beats Nancy to death, Sikes apparently is capable of feeling guilt—although the reader cannot be sure the emotion is not merely his suspicion that Fagin lied to him about her betrayal and fear of being arrested for the crime.

Sikes lives in Bethnal Green and later moves to the squalid rookery area of London then called Jacob&#x27;s Island, east of present-day Shad Thames. Otherwise, Sikes&#x27;s background and early life prior to joining Fagin are not mentioned in the book.

==Theatrical, cinematic, TV and radio portrayals==

===Theatre===
In the theatre, Sikes was played by Richard John Smith in &quot;Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1839), and by Henry Irving opposite Nelly Moore as Nancy in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London (1868).

Sikes was played by Danny Sewell in both the original West End and Broadway productions of the stage musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; which won several awards in the early 1960s. Oliver Reed played Sikes in the musical&#x27;s 1968 film adaptation which also won several awards, including the Oscar for Best Picture, with Reed&#x27;s performance often cited as one of the best portrayals of Sikes – being labelled as &quot;the sinister core of the film&quot;. His songs are removed from the film, making his performance of the character closer to that of the novel rather than the stage version. The famous climax of the 1948 film adaptation is retained and Sikes dies in the same manner of being shot and his body dangling from the rope about his body. Sikes was played by Graeme Campbell in the 1984 Broadway revival, Miles Anderson (later Steven Hartley) in the 1994 London revival, Burn Gorman (later Steven Hartley again) in the 2009 London revival and by Tam Mutu in the 2023 Encores! revival. Aaron Sidwell has played the role since July 2024, in Cameron Mackintosh’s revival at both Chichester Festival Theatre and Gielgud Theatre in London.

===Film===
Robert Newton first played Sikes on screen in the 1948 British film noir &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Sikes&#x27;s death is changed slightly: while attempting to swing to another building to escape the mob, he is shot by a police officer and dies while dangling from a building by a rope around his body. Perhaps Newton&#x27;s portrayal is the closest to how Dickens himself envisioned the character: a vicious, heavy drinking sociopath.

In Disney&#x27;s animated version, &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), Sikes is renamed Sykes and he is a cold-hearted loan shark who lives and works in a New York shipyard and is voiced by Robert Loggia, who was cast in the role after Marlon Brando rejected an offer to voice the character because he felt the film was going to be a flop. Sikes&#x27;s dog from the novel, Bull&#x27;s-eye, is replaced by two Dobermans named Roscoe and DeSoto. Fagin, here depicted as a hobo living with several dogs, owes him money before Sykes proceeds to kidnap a young wealthy girl, Jenny Foxworth, planning to take a ransom to himself. In a final confrontation, Sykes chases Fagin and the dogs into the subway tunnels in attempt to recapture Jenny until they reach the Brooklyn Bridge. While Roscoe and DeSoto are killed when they fall onto the electrified railway, Sykes fights with Oliver and Dodger on the roof of his limousine, and is brutally killed when his car collides with a train, sending his corpse falling into the East River.

In the 2021 movie, &quot;Twist&quot;, Sikes is altered into a female portrayed by Lena Headey with a pet Doberman named Bull&#x27;s-eye and appears to be a lesbian when seen in a supposed relationship with Nancy.

===Television===
Peter Vaughan portrayed Sikes in the BBC&#x27;s 1962 television adaptation, which saw the character portrayed in a gritty, violent way considered to be faithful to the original book. The scene where he brutally murders Nancy was very controversial at the time, with questions being asked in parliament if the serial should&#x27;ve even been allowed to air.

In Disney&#x27;s 1997 live-action television production, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Bill Sikes is played by David O&#x27;Hara. In the 2005 &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; Bill Sikes is played by Jamie Foreman.

In 2007, Sikes is portrayed by actor Tom Hardy in the BBC One miniseries &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, later aired in the United States on PBS&#x27; &quot;Masterpiece Classic&quot;.

In the 2015 BBC TV series &quot;Dickensian&quot;, Sikes is played by Mark Stanley.

===Radio===
The very first radio portrayal of Bill Sikes was on British radio in 1928 by Philip H. Harper. Successive radio Sikes included Matthew Boulton in 1934 on the BBC Regional Programme, Allan Jeaves in 1941 on the BBC Home Service, Ralph Truman in 1952 on the BBC Home Service, John Hollis in 1970 on BBC Radio 4, and Tim McInnerny in 1994 on BBC Radio 4.

<text>Essendon Airport is an Australian electronic music, post-punk group formed in 1978 which explored experimental minimalist and funk music. Founding mainstays were the duo of David Chesworth on electric piano and drum machine and Robert Goodge on guitar. They were joined in late 1980 by Ian Cox on saxophone and Paul Fletcher on drums.

In 1982 they added Barbara Hogarth on bass guitar but disbanded in the following year. The group issued a four-track extended play, &quot;Sonic Investigations (Of the Trivial)&quot; (May 1980), and a studio album, &quot;Palimpsest&quot; (May 1982). They reformed as the original duo line-up for occasional performances in 2003 after the issue of a compilation album, &quot;Sonic Investigations of the Trivial&quot;. A new double CD version of &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, and other live material, was released by Chapter Music in August 2011.

In September 2022, the group released their first new music in 40 years, with the double-A 7&quot; single &quot;Agua Por Favor&quot;/&quot;Ten Thousand Steps&quot;, featuring vocalist Anne Cessna.

== History ==

=== 1978–80: Formation to &quot;Sonic Investigations&quot; ===

Formed in Melbourne, Essendon Airport began as an instrumental electronic music duo in 1978 by Robert Goodge on lead guitar and David Chesworth on Wurlitzer electric piano and a home made drum machine, bought via the &quot;Trading Post&quot;. Both members lived in or near the suburb of Essendon, and took the name of Essendon Airport which since 1971 was no longer an international terminal (replaced by Melbourne Airport in Tullamarine).

The duo version released a four-track extended play, &quot;Sonic Investigations (Of the Trivial)&quot;, in May 1980 on Innocent Records. The duo described the EP&#x27;s tracks, &quot;songs which combine many of the most facile and insipid kinds of music in a redeemingly dignified manner... creating new trivia out of old. All this takes place along with a kind of pedantic fetishism for small-repetition games - the music travels in circles, spirals and solid blocks of sameness and difference.&quot; The label, Innocent Records, was co-owned by Chesworth and Philip Brophy (of performance group, → ↑ →).

Essendon Airport followed with a single, &quot;Talking to Cleopatra&quot; (September 1980), with Anne Cessna ( Anne Sanger) on lead vocals. Sanger later recalled working with the duo, &quot;we were sitting around one night when Robert and David were tossing around the idea of recording a single with a vocalist. But who should that be? I said I&#x27;d do it. I was partly being facetious. I wasn’t at all sure I could sing. Neither were they.&quot; According to &quot;theMusic.com.au&quot;″s writer, &quot;[it] went on to be something of a cult favourite among the Melburnian alt-music scene of the early 1980s.&quot;

This manifestation of Essendon Airport is less well known than the later ones but played memorable performances around Melbourne including the Clifton Hill Community Music Centre and supports at the Crystal Ballroom in front of bemused audience members waiting for bands like Midnight Oil or Jimmy and the Boys.

=== 1980–83: &quot;Palimpsest&quot; to break-up ===

Late in 1980 Essendon Airport became a four-piece, adding Ian Cox on saxophone and Paul Fletcher on drums. They performed around Melbourne&#x27;s newly emerging post-punk inner-city venues such as the Crystal Ballroom, various galleries such as the George Paton, and the Clifton Hill Community Music Centre (CHCMC), a venue for experimental music, performance and film during this time. They worked closely with → ↑ →.

Embellished with Fletcher&#x27;s arrhythmic drumming and Ian Cox&#x27; sweet, brittle saxophone, the four-piece provided a range of styles from extreme minimalism to plundering the hidden resonances in the popular song. Examples can be heard on the debut studio album, &quot;Palimpsest&quot; (Innocent Records), which appeared in May 1982. The group also made recordings for the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; cassette magazine and a disc give-away for the &quot;Art Network&quot; magazine.

Adding bass player Barabara Hogarth (from Government Drums with Willy Zygier and Richard Pleasance), the group developed material with a funk feel and performed head-lining shows at the Jump Club, and Crystal Ballroom, and toured to Sydney. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the five-piece line-up, &quot;[they] played a hybrid of modern jazz, rock and funk.&quot; No recordings by the quintet were released until 2011, when the 2× CD version of &quot;Palimpsest&quot; included live and studio tracks, including a live-to-air performances on 3RRR FM from the Crystal Ballroom which was their final performance. The group disbanded in mid-1983.

After the dissolution of Essendon Airport, Chesworth continued performing as a soloist and in 1985 formed a new group, Whaddya Want?, with Warwick Bone on synthesiser, Phillip Jackson (ex-Whirlywirld, Equal Local) on synthesiser, Bill McDonald on bass guitar and Michael Sheridan on lead guitar. Goodge, Cox and Hogarth formed the nucleus of the successful pop-funk band, I&#x27;m Talking in late 1983, which included Kate Ceberano as lead vocalist. Three years after the dissolution of I&#x27;m Talking, Cox, Chesworth and Goodge collaborated again, in 1990, in the group, Power Trip featuring Mr Larry Weems, alongside John Course, Angus Davidson, Mark Forrester, John McCall and Simon Polinski. Chesworth later formed the instrumental group, the David Chesworth Ensemble, for which Goodge has occasionally performed.

=== 2003–present: Reformations===

In 2003, a compilation CD was released via Chapter Music entitled &quot;Sonic Investigations of The Trivial&quot;, comprising live and studio recordings of the duo from 1978-1980. Following this release Essendon Airport have given occasional performances in their original duo guise. They perform their original music having painstakingly transferred the drum machine sounds from old tapes onto computer and have also added some new pieces. Graham Lee (ex-The Triffids) has been accompanying them on pedal-steel guitar. In 2011 Chapter Music reissued &quot;Palimpsest&quot; as a 2× CD with additional live tracks, and a four-piece version with Chesworth, Fletcher and Goodge were joined by Phil Bywater to perform live in support of the release. Bywater stood in for original saxophonist Ian Cox.

In September 2022, the group released the double-A 7&quot; single &quot;Agua Por Favor&quot;/&quot;Ten Thousand Steps&quot;, featuring vocalist Anne Cessna, and artwork by Paul Fletcher.

<doc id="1194486" wikidata="Q23727" url="?curid=1194486" title="Laguiole knife">
<text>The Laguiole knife (, locally ) is a traditional Occitan pocketknife originally produced in the &quot;knife city&quot; of Thiers, source of 70% of France&#x27;s cutting tool production, as well as the small village of Laguiole, both located in the Massif Central region of France. Laguiole in this instance does not refer to any knife brand in France, where use of the name is not legally restricted, but to a generic type of traditional slipjoint knife of a sort associated with this French region, now made worldwide.

== History ==

The major influence on the form of the classic &quot;laguiole&quot; is most likely the Arabo-Hispanic clasp knife of Andalusian Spain, the &quot;navaja&quot;. The &quot;laguiole&quot; was first designed in 1829 by Jean-Pierre Calmels. The earliest forms of &quot;laguiole&quot; knife were straight-bladed and handled, the so-called &quot;laguiole droit&quot;; the classic &quot;navaja&quot;-like &quot;laguiole&quot; seems to have been developed around 1860. The Calmels &quot;laguiole droit&quot; had a &#x27;half-lock&#x27; on the blade where a small projection on the end of the backspring (&quot;mouche&quot;) exerts pressure on a corresponding indent in the heel of blade when the knife is open; this, and not the full locking system of the &quot;navaja&quot;, remained a fixed feature in subsequent &quot;laguiole&quot; knives. Seasonal migrations of shepherds and cattle herders between Catalan Spain and southern France in summer and winter introduced the &quot;navaja&quot; to France. The Arabo-Hispanic design of the &quot;navaja&quot; was merged with that of local folding knives represented by older patterns such as the &quot;laguiole droit&quot; and &quot;Capuchadou&quot;; the result became the classic &quot;laguiole&quot;. In 1840, the first awl or trocar (a surgical instrument used to puncture body cavities and relieve the suffering of cattle and other animals with bloat) was added to the some &quot;laguiole&quot; knife patterns. In 1880, some models of the &quot;laguiole&quot; began featuring a corkscrew, in response to demands from the owners of bars in the Auvergne, and restaurants in Paris.

== Design ==


Classic &quot;laguiole&quot; knives feature a slim, sinuous outline. They are about 12 cm long when closed, with a narrow, tapered blade of a semi-yataghan form, steel backspring (slipjoint) and a high quality of construction. Traditionally, the handle was made of cattle horn; however, nowadays other materials are sometimes used. These materials include French woods, exotic woods from all around the world, and fossilised mammoth ivory from Alaska or Siberia. The French designer Philippe Starck re-designed &quot;laguiole&quot; knives using aluminium for the grips, but it was only a revival of a 1910 model. The blade is often made of stainless steel or high-carbon steel, with XC75 steels being 0.75% carbon and XC100 being 1% carbon.

The traditional &quot;laguiole&quot; utilizes a single blade, but sometimes a corkscrew or some other implement is added. This necessitates an even slimmer cutaway handle, the shape of which is fancifully known as the &quot;lady&#x27;s leg&quot;, the bolster at the base resembling a foot. A &#x27;Shepherd&#x27;s Cross&#x27; consisting of 6–8 inlaid metal pins forming a cross can be found on the handle of some &quot;laguioles&quot;. It is a myth that this embellishment is a reference to a legend of Catholic shepherds in need of a cross for prayer during their seasonal migrations between the mountains and the plains. The cross can be found in the knives not earlier than the 1950s and is a mere decoration.

There is much mythology about the insect depicted on the spring. A legend identifies the design as a bee granted by Emperor Napoleon I (the bee was adopted as a dynastic symbol by Napoleon) in recognition of the courage of local soldiers. However, the &quot;bee&quot; on the &quot;laguiole&quot; knives was only introduced after World War II, more than a century after the death of the emperor. Technically, &quot;la mouche&quot; (the fly) is the end of the backspring, which sits over the rotating part of the blade. The upper section was expanded to form a thumb rest. Older &quot;laguiole&quot; knives feature many kinds of decorated springs which don&#x27;t necessarily feature insects.

There are about 109 production steps for a one-piece &quot;laguiole&quot; (single blade), about 166 for a two-piece one (blade and one other tool), and about 216 for a three-piece model (blade and two tools – corkscrew and awl).

The name &quot;Laguiole&quot; has since been used as a trademark designation for various other implements, so that one can now buy, for example, a &quot;Laguiole&quot; corkscrew, spoon, or steak-knife set.

== French and overseas production ==

As &quot;laguiole&quot; designates a type of knife and is not a brand or trade name of cutlery, &quot;laguiole&quot; knives are manufactured globally. This has led to the widespread availability of inexpensive, and sometimes low-quality, &quot;laguiole&quot; knives from China and elsewhere. &quot;Laguiole&quot; knives from France are currently produced in the cutlery town of Thiers, and more recently, production resumed in the village of Laguiole, the knife&#x27;s namesake. French manufacturers stamp a trademark or signature into the steel of their knives. A description of the type of steel used and &quot;Made in France&quot; will often be stamped as well.

<doc id="1194492" wikidata="Q1233612" url="?curid=1194492" title="Marcus Atilius Bradua">
<text>Marcus Atilius Bradua, also known by his full name Marcus Atilius Metilius Bradua was a Roman politician who lived in the second half of the 1st century and the first half of the 2nd century in the Roman Empire.

==Biography==
Bradua was a member of the gens Atilia. He was born and raised in a Roman family of consular rank, possibly of Patrician rank. Bradua originated in Cisalpina (northern Italy). His father, Marcus Atilius Postumus Bradua, served as a proconsul of the Asia Province under the Emperor Domitian (81–96). His second nomen, &quot;Metilius&quot;, suggests that his mother may have been a Metilia. If so, his uncle could be the governor Publius Metilius Nepos.

Probably due to his patrician rank, Bradua went from the quaestorship to praetorship. There is a possibility at some point he could have served as a military tribune. In 108, Bradua served as an ordinary consul with Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus. After his time as consul, he was admitted to the College of Pontiffs.

From probably at least 111 until 118, Bradua served as the governor of Britain. At an unknown date he served as governor of either Germania Inferior or Germania Superior. Either in the year 122 or 123, Bradua became Proconsul of the Africa Province. Sometime after his African Proconsulship, he may have accompanied Hadrian on one of his numerous journeys around the Empire. Bradua outlived Hadrian&#x27;s reign and died at an unknown date during the reign of the Emperor Antoninus Pius (138–161).

==Marriage and issue==
Bradua married Caucidia Tertulla, an aristocrat who may have had Etruscan lineage. Tertulla bore Bradua two children:
* Son, Marcus Atilius Metilius Bradua Caucidius Tertullus...Bassus. He served as Proconsul of the Africa Province under Antoninus Pius.
* Daughter, Atilia Caucidia Tertulla, who married the younger Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus. His father, the elder Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus, was Bradua&#x27;s consular colleague in 108. Atilia Caucidia Tertulla bore the younger Appius Annius Trebonius Gallus two children.

One of the proconsular governors of Africa, Publius Vigellius Raius Plarius Saturninus Atilius Braduanus Caucidius Tertullus, may have been a descendant of Bradua&#x27;s marriage to Caucidia Tertulla.

==Posthumous Honors==
At Olympia, Greece, there is a stone inscription dedicated to him by his granddaughter Aspasia Annia Regilla.

: The city of the Eleans (honors) Marcus Appius Bradua (Greek: &quot;Μαρκόν Άππιον Βραδούαν&quot; ), quaestor, praetor, [?proconsul of … and of Africa?, comes?] of the god Hadrian, consular (governor) of Germany and Britain, pontifex, sodalis Hadrianalis, maternal grandfather of Regilla, wife of Herodes.

On a stone, dated perhaps after 126, there is an honorific inscription stating, “[…] Bradua […] Propraetor”, that is found in Gwynedd. This may refer to the period that Bradua was governor of Britain.

Aspasia Annia Regilla and her husband Herodes Atticus had built at Olympia an outdoor monument called an exedra, which featured statues honoring their various relatives and members of the ruling imperial family. Among the statues that Regilla added was one of Bradua, of which only the head and his portrait bust survived, and is on display at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia.

<text>Church Stowe is a village in West Northamptonshire in England. It is the largest settlement in the civil parish of Stowe Nine Churches (Where the population is included).

St Michael&#x27;s church is notable for the tomb of Elizabeth Danvers and the tower built in Anglo Saxon times. The rest of the church was built in 1639 but includes remains of the medieval church. The east end was rebuilt in 1860

According to legend, the site of the church was chosen by a supernatural spirit. It is said that the church&#x27;s builders found their materials moved to a different location overnight for nine consecutive nights, so they eventually built the church in that location. This is supposedly where the name Stowe Nine Churches derives from.

<text>The value of control is a quantitative measure of the value of controlling the outcome of an uncertain variable. Decision analysis provides a means for calculating the value of both perfect and imperfect control. The former value, informally known as the value of wizardry, is an upper bound for the latter. Obtaining meaningful value-of-control measurements requires an awareness of important restrictions (concerning the nature of free will and the meaning of counterfactual statements) on the validity of this kind of analysis.
