<doc id="1218305" wikidata="Q1500817" url="?curid=1218305" title="Fugen Nuclear Power Plant">
<text>Fugen was a prototype Japanese nuclear test reactor.
Fugen was a domestic Japanese design for a demonstration Advanced Thermal Reactor. It was a heavy water moderated, boiling light water cooled reactor.
The reactor was started in 1979 and shut down in 2003. As of 2018, it is undergoing decommissioning.
It is located in Myōjin-chō, in the city of Tsuruga, Fukui. 
The name &quot;Fugen&quot; is derived from Fugen Bosatsu (Samantabhadra), a Buddhist deity.

The reactor was the first in the world to use a full MOX fuel core. 
It had 772 assemblies, the most in the world. It has received the title of a historic landmark from the American Nuclear Society.

The design boils ordinary water like a boiling water reactor (BWR) but uses heavy water as a moderator as in a CANDU reactor. 
The electrical output was 165 MW and the thermal output was 557 MW.

*Core temperature: 300 °C
*Pellet centerline temperature: 2200 °C
*Fuel conversion time: 6 months

The plant is located on a site that covers 267,694 m2 (66 acres); buildings occupy 7,762 m2 (1.9 acres), and it has 46,488 m2 of floor space. It employed 256 workers.

==Accidents==
* 14–16 April 1997: A tritium leakage was announced to the responsible authorities 30 hours after the event. During the following investigation it was shown that it already had 11 similar incidents. Five managers of the operator at that time (at the time Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation) resigned.
* 8 April 2002: About 200 cubic meters of steam escaped from a defective pipe. The reactor was switched off.

During dismantling operations it was found that walls with controls did not have the necessary strength at 25 of 34 points.

<text>Bradford Swain Linaweaver (September 1, 1952 – August 29, 2019) was an American science fiction writer, film producer, actor, and magazine publisher. Over a 40-year career, he completed a body of work including novels, short stories, and screenplays.

==Early years and education==
Brad Linaweaver was born September 1, 1952, in Washington, North Carolina, the only child of Melville and June Linaweaver (née Swain). The family moved to the outskirts of Orlando, Florida in 1958, when Brad was six years old, where his father engaged in real estate development and investments. Linaweaver attended Orange County public schools, before attending Florida State University. He obtained his MFA degree in a program for poets and writers from Rollins College. Although he spent the better part of his career in Hollywood, he eventually settled at the family lake front home in Apopka, which his father designed and built shortly after moving to Florida in 1958.

==Career==
===Political essayist===
In late 1970, during his freshman year at Florida State University, Linaweaver joined the local college chapter of the national conservative organization &quot;Young Americans for Freedom&quot; (YAF). Both conservative and libertarian ideologies were represented within the local YAF chapter, prompting Linaweaver to begin writing and debating about the various political philosophies competing for followers on college campuses at that time. This eventually led to his first sale to a national publication, a short article &quot;The Wish&quot;, which made the case for capitalism over socialism. The article appeared in &quot;The New Guard&quot;, the magazine published by YAF. Subsequent articles in that publication drew the attention of public intellectual, conservative author, and YAF founder William F. Buckley. Linaweaver and Buckley subsequently struck up a friendship and correspondence, which lasted decades until Buckley&#x27;s death in 2008. Through that relationship, Linaweaver eventually published essays in Buckley&#x27;s magazine &quot;National Review&quot;. Unknown to him at the time, Linaweaver&#x27;s writing also caught the attention of Ronald Reagan. In 1976, Reagan devoted one of his radio show broadcasts to a discussion of &quot;The Wish&quot;, praising Linaweaver in the process. Reagan summed up his commentary on Linaweaver with the line, &quot;How right he is!&quot; The radio broadcast is included in the Reagan CD set &quot;In His Own Voice&quot; and in the book &quot;Stories in His Own Hand: The Everyday Wisdom of Ronald Reagan&quot;. Linaweaver didn&#x27;t learn about the endorsement from Reagan until decades later. He mused that if he had known about it earlier, it might have changed the trajectory of his career path. &quot;I never would have had my career in Hollywood. I might have been a boring political hack in Washington, trying to capitalize on the Reagan endorsement to be a political speechwriter. I&#x27;d be a worse libertarian than I am today.&quot; Instead, Linaweaver soon took up writing science fiction, and stories for movies, inserting his libertarian ideology into the works whenever feasible. In a 2007 interview, he noted that &quot;I&#x27;ve been getting libertarian messages into everything for a quarter of a century&quot;. But, he observed, not every genre lent itself to his form of political promotionalism. &quot;My involvement with movies has been mostly low-budget, exploitation stuff where ideology is not that relevant. When you&#x27;re writing science fiction for a New York publisher, you actually achieve something when you slip in a libertarian idea. But with independent, exploitation, low-budget Hollywood, there&#x27;s already an anti-authoritarian attitude. That culture is by nature fairly libertarian. There&#x27;s less need to be a propagandist.&quot;

===Film===
Linaweaver began his film career in 1978 with an original story credit for &quot;The Brain Leeches&quot;, the film that also jump started the career of prodigious Hollywood director producer (and sometimes professional wrestler) Fred Olen Ray. &quot;The Brain Leeches&quot; was completed, on budget, for $298.00. His association with Ray continued throughout Linaweaver&#x27;s life, and included work on &quot;Jack-O&quot; which Linaweaver wrote and Ray produced, as well as later projects like &quot;Super Shark&quot;, a 2011 Ray film where Linaweaver was executive producer. Linaweaver&#x27;s long association with independent film also included writing credits on low budget direct-to-video titles like &quot;The Boneyard Collection&quot;, &quot;Space Babes Meet the Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Low Budget Time Machine&quot;. Linaweaver&#x27;s association with Ray, and others, led to a number of small acting roles, both uncredited and 16 credited in numerous independent films.

===Science fiction===
Linaweaver&#x27;s first published science fiction sale was in the July 1980 issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot; with the short story &quot;The Competitor&quot;, which was later adapted as a radio play and stage production by the Atlanta Radio Theatre Company.

====Moon of Ice====
What soon followed is considered Linaweaver&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Moon of Ice&quot;. It is an alternate history tale that has Nazi Germany being the first to develop an atomic bomb, and using it to defeat the Soviet Union and Great Britain...only to reach a stalemate with the United States, which uses its own atomic bomb to defeat Japan. The work allowed Linaweaver to expound upon the different outcomes of economic models (National Socialism in Germany, Libertarianism in the United States), as well as the little known cultist underpinnings and beliefs of the Nazi regime. The work began in the form of a novella, which soon drew the attention of the science fiction community, resulting in a 1983 nomination for the Nebula Award, and finishing as a finalist in that category. Linaweaver then expanded the story to novel length, firmly establishing himself within the realm of Libertarian science fiction writers, and winning a Prometheus Award. The novel garnered the endorsements of Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and William F. Buckley, Jr. While many reviews praised the handling of economic themes, and Linaweaver&#x27;s research into the little known cultist beliefs of some Nazi elites (including a hollow earth, and a moon made of ice), some found fault with the story telling, opining that the torrent of information &quot;numbs rather than stimulates&quot;.

====Other novels====
His novel &quot;Sliders&quot;, based on the television series of the same name, includes a thorough critique of communism, expanding on ideas Linaweaver first explored in &quot;The Wish&quot; at the beginning of his career. His other novels include &quot;The Land Beyond Summer&quot;, four Doom novels with Dafydd ab Hugh, three &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; novels with actor Richard Hatch, and &quot;Anarquia&quot; with J. Kent Hastings, an alternate history treatment of the Spanish Civil War. The first collection of his short stories was published under the title &quot;Clownface&quot;.

Over his career, Linaweaver wrote more than 50 stories that found their way into print.

====Collaborations and awards====
Linaweaver&#x27;s 1995 story collaboration with Victor Koman, &quot;The Light That Blinds&quot; featured an occult battle between Aleister Crowley and Adolf Hitler.

In 1993, Linaweaver&#x27;s short story &quot;Unmerited Favor&quot; was published in Mike Resnick&#x27;s anthology &quot;Alternate Warriors&quot;.

In 1998, Linaweaver&#x27;s short story &quot;And to the Republic For Which It Stands&quot; was published in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s anthology &quot;Alternate Generals&quot;. In 2005, his short story &quot;A Good Bag&quot; was collected in another of Turtledove&#x27;s anthologies &quot;Alternate Generals III&quot;.

In 2004, he co-authored &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot; with former movie magazine editor and film memorabilia collector Forrest J Ackerman. The hardcover coffee table book featured cover art from science fiction&#x27;s Golden Age, from Ackerman&#x27;s considerable collection, and included full color reproductions and commentary from the authors.

Linaweaver shared a second &quot;Prometheus Award&quot; with Ed Kramer for co-editing &quot;Free Space,&quot; a libertarian science fiction anthology from TOR books.

Several of his short stories received Honorable Mention in &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy and Horror&quot; by Ellen Datlow. Those stories included &quot;The Lon Chaney Factory&quot;, &quot;Clutter&quot;, &quot;A Real Babe&quot;, and &quot;Chump Hoist&quot;. The Science Fiction story, &quot;Wells of Wisdom&quot; made the preliminary Nebula ballot and was part of the Galaxy Audio Project, read by Catherine Oxenberg.

===Web series===
Linaweaver also wrote and produced online content, including the award-winning web series &quot;Silicon Assassin&quot;, starring Richard Hatch, currently available on YouTube.

===Magazine publishing===
Linaweaver&#x27;s many years in Hollywood, and the stories and personalities he had come to know while living there, culminated in the creation of movie magazine &quot;Mondo Cult&quot;, with Linaweaver as publisher. The magazine featured literary contributions from, and articles about, Linaweaver&#x27;s eclectic list of celebrity friends and contacts, including &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; actor Richard Hatch; science fiction author and collector Forrest J. Ackerman; the conservative commentator, publisher, and television personality William F. Buckley, Jr.; adult cinema legend Traci Lords and poetry from speculative fiction icon Ray Bradbury and Linaweaver&#x27;s college friend and YAF colleague, Georgia State Representative Chesley V. Morton. Mondo Cult is edited by former Famous Monsters of Filmland editor, Jessie Lilley.

==Heinlein&#x27;s brass cannon==
Linaweaver owned a signaling gun, or small brass cannon, which had originally belonged to science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein. Heinlein and his wife Virginia, had acquired the cannon in 1964, immediately following the Goldwater campaign. It later provided inspiration for &quot;The Brass Cannon&quot; which was Heinlein&#x27;s working title for the 1966 novel which eventually became &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. In that novel, Heinlein refers to the cannon, in a parable implying that self-government is an illusion caused by failure to understand reality. For nearly 30 years, the firing of the brass cannon was a July 4 tradition at the Heinlein residence. Virginia Heinlein retained the cannon after her husband&#x27;s death in 1988, and it was bequeathed to Linaweaver in her will, after Virginia died in 2003. Linaweaver restored the cannon to working order and subsequently posted a 2007 video of it being fired several times (with very small charges) on YouTube.

==Death==
Brad Linaweaver, age 66, died August 29, 2019, of cancer at his home in Apopka, Florida.

<doc id="1218319" wikidata="Q5159722" url="?curid=1218319" title="Confederate Powderworks">
<text>The Confederate Powderworks (a.k.a. the Augusta Powderworks) was a gunpowder factory during the American Civil War. It is one of the only permanent structures completed by the Confederate States of America that wasn&#x27;t destroyed by Union forces. Colonel George Washington Rains chose the old United States Arsenal site between the Augusta Canal and Savannah River in Augusta, Georgia, as a secure inland location with good rail and water connections.
The Powderworks produced almost 3 million pounds of gunpowder during the war.

==History==
George Washington Rains graduated from West Point with the class of 1842 and served as a chemistry teacher for the Military Academy. He had resigned to become president of an iron works in Newburgh, New York. At the start of the Civil War he chose allegiance to his native North Carolina and returned to the south. He was placed in charge of the Gunpowder and Niter Bureau by Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.

Construction of the powder works began in September 1861, a 130 hp steam engine was purchased from an Atlanta flour mill owned by Richard Peters and the powder works was producing gunpowder in just 7 months in 1862. Rains was guided by a pamphlet written by a British artillery officer describing the powder works at Waltham Abbey in Essex County near London, and also found someone who had worked there to advise him. 

As was customary for gunpowder mills, the buildings were separated and designed to survive explosions, with raw materials starting at one end, and the finished powder ending a mile and a half away at the other end. The saltpeter refinery building was the largest, was designed in Gothic style as a replica of the British Houses of Parliament. 

The Confederate Powderworks was the second largest gunpowder factory in the world at that time, producing 3.5 tons per day. More than 2.75 million pounds of first-quality gunpowder (a majority of the powder used by the Confederacy) were produced before its closure in 1865. By comparison, Union gunpowder manufacture was distributed among many mills, with the larger Hazard Powder Company of Connecticut producing 40% of the annual production of 8.4 million pounds.

== Remains ==
Although the massive works were seized and dismantled after the war ended, Rains asked in 1872 that the obelisk chimney be spared as he had designed it to &quot;... remain a monument to the Confederacy should the Powderworks pass away&quot;. On June 2, 1879, Augusta gave custody of the chimney to the Confederate Survivors Association to &quot;beautify it and protect it from injury as a Confederate Memorial&quot;. The association repaired the square castellated base, protected the corners and in the face, looking towards the canal inserted a large tablet of Italian marble, bearing this inscription: &quot;This Obelisk Chimney — sole remnant of the extensive Powder Works here erected under the auspices of the Confederate Government — is by the Confederate Survivors&#x27; Association of Augusta, with the consent of the City Council, conserved in Honor of a fallen Nation, and inscribed to the memory of those who died in the Southern Armies during the War Between the States&quot;.

The 150 foot tall chimney still stands on the Augusta Canal and is one of the more recognizable features of the Augusta skyline today, located at the Sibley Mill at 1717 Goodrich Street in Augusta. The Sibley cotton mill was built on the site as a private venture in 1880–82, using bricks from the demolished powder works, and became one of the largest and most successful cotton mills in the region. It manufactured denim until 2006, and the mill&#x27;s water-driven turbines still generate electricity which is sold to Georgia Power.

The chimney is the only remaining portion of the original powder works. The B/G E. Porter Alexander Camp #158, Sons of Confederate Veterans, spent eight years raising $192,000 to restore the chimney with its historical marker; work started on November 19, 2009, and was completed on March 12, 2010. A rededication ceremony was held on Oct. 9, 2010.

<text>Santa Lucía Hill (), also known in Mapuche as Huelén Hill (), is a small hill in the centre of Santiago, Chile. It is situated between Alameda del Libertador Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins in the south, Santa Lucía Street in the west and Victoria Subercaseaux on the east. An adjacent metro station is named after it. The hill has an altitude of 629 m and a height of 69 m over the surrounding area. The hill is the remnant of a volcano 15 million years old.

The hill comprises a 65,300 square metre park adorned with ornate facades, stairways and fountains. At the highest point there is a viewpoint popular with tourists visiting the city and meeting point.

==History==
It was originally called Huelito o heutrecan by the pre-colonization inhabitants. However, the current name comes from the day in which Pedro de Valdivia conquered the hill, on December 13, 1540. That day celebrates &quot;Santa Lucía.&quot;

Its first use by its missionaries was as a point of worship, or prayer in the years of the chicken pox outbreak (1541).

In 1816, Manuel Olaguer Feliú, the Brigadier of the Royal Engineers, designed and built two forts or castles on Santa Lucía Hill, one north and the other south of the hill. The forts were built out of stone and lime and could fit eight or twelve cannons each. Besides, Olaguer Feliú drew and built an outbuilding for ammunition depot and to house the garrison.

On one side of the hill, Fort Hidalgo was finished in 1820 as a defensive point. On the other side, the hillside terrain was used as a &quot;cemetery for the dissidents&quot;, people who did not follow the then-official Roman Catholic faith, or were considered otherwise unworthy of burial at hallowed grounds. However, the remains buried in the hillside under this fashion were eventually transferred to a secluded section of the General Cemetery, before said cemetery, in turn, was opened to all burials regardless of creed or social condition.

In 1849 James Melville Gilliss led an American naval astronomical expedition to Chile in order to more precisely measure the solar parallax. An observatory was set up on Santa Lucía Hill and operated by Gilliss. When the expedition ended in September 1852 the observatory and related equipment was sold to the Chilean government and formed the nucleus of the first National Astronomical Observatory.

In 1872 Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna decided to conduct a dramatic change to the urban atmosphere of the city of Santiago, among his many works aimed to improve the city, and thus initiated an extensive remodelation of the hill.
The works of 1872 consisted of a road which crossed the hill, which at the top accessed a chapel which he also built there, illuminated by the then-novel means of gas. The rest of the hill contains a park with fountains and lookouts. The actual hill is watered by a sophisticated irrigation system. The now iconic yellow and white facade is also a product of Vicuña Mackenna&#x27;s remodelation.

Vicuña Mackenna was assisted in realizing his designs by the architect Manuel Aldunate, the constructor Enrique Henes, and the stonecutter Andrés Staimbuck.

A few years ago, Santa Lucía hill received an improvement in its illumination system and protections. Also, Fort Hidalgo was restored and reopened to the public. Traditionally, a cannon shot is fired exactly at noon.

==Curiosity==

Located in Santa Lucía Hill there is a monument which consists of a 2 m high stone carved with a paragraph extracted from the text that Pedro de Valdivia sent to emperor Charles V describing the features of the new land conquered.

==In popular culture==
Santa Lucía Hill is one of the entrances to the abyss in the videogame Abyss Odyssey, the entrance is located in the east part of the Terraza Neptuno.

Santa Lucía Hill was featured on the second episode of &quot;The Amazing Race 7&quot; with the competing teams finishing their leg in Santiago at Terraza Neptuno. The eighth season of the Israeli version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; also finished its sixth leg at Terraza Neptuno.

<text>John Harrison (12 November 1890 – 3 May 1917) was a professional rugby league footballer who played for Hull F.C.. He later became a British Army officer, and was the posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Harrison was born in Hull on 12 November 1890. His father was a plater and boilermaker in the Earles Shipyard. After leaving school, Harrison studied at St John&#x27;s College, York (now York St John University) where he was Rugby club captain and also represented the College at cricket and swimming before becoming a teacher later at Lime Street School in Hull. In York, he caught the attention of the York rugby league club, and played for them five times in 1911–12, scoring three tries.

He returned to Hull in September 1912 and married Lillian on 1 September 1914. He was invited to join Hull F.C. which included Billy Batten, and played his first match on 5 September 1912. In 1913–14 season, he scored a record 52 tries and he went on to score a total of 106 tries in 116 matches for Hull up to 1916. Jack Harrison played on the and scored a try in Hull F.C.&#x27;s 6–0 victory over Wakefield Trinity in the 1914 Challenge Cup Final during the 1913–14 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax, in front of a crowd of 19,000.

==First World War==
Not long after the birth of his son, Jackie, and while living at 75 Wharncliffe Street, Hull, Harrison volunteered for the army. He started receiving officer training on 4 November 1915, as a private in the Inns of Court Officer Training Corps. On completion of training, he was commissioned as a probationary temporary second lieutenant in the East Yorkshire Regiment on 5 August 1916, and was posted to 6 Platoon, 11th (Service) Battalion (the Hull Tradesmen). In February 1917 the Hull brigade entered the front line once again and Jack was soon in the thick of the action. On 25 February, Harrison led a patrol into no man&#x27;s land, and for this action he was awarded the Military Cross (MC). The citation for his MC read:


On 3 May 1917 came the actions that led to his VC, during the Capture of Oppy Wood as part of the Battle of Arras. Ordered, with the rest of his brigade, to attack a wood near Oppy, Pas-de-Calais, his platoon became pinned down by machine gun fire. The citation for his VC describes events in more detail:

Harrison&#x27;s body was never found. He is commemorated on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Arras Memorial.

==Further information==
Lilian Harrison was presented with his Victoria Cross at Buckingham Palace by King George V in March 1918. The war widow benefitted from a fund raised in Hull to provide for the younger John Harrison’s education. Their son went on to serve as an officer in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s West Riding Regiment during the Second World War, and was killed as a captain in the defence of Dunkirk, and is buried in the Dunkirk town cemetery.

Lillian Harrison died on 5 December 1977, and bequeathed Harrison&#x27;s medals to the East Yorkshire regimental museum in Beverley (now part of the Museum of Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire Museum in Tower St, York).

In 2017, York St John alumnus, Patrick H. A. Neal, released his biography of Harrison, &quot;The Heroic Johnsman: The Story of Jack Harrison VC, MC&quot;.

<text>The Seven Wonders of Wales () is a traditional list of notable landmarks in north Wales, commemorated in an anonymously written rhyme:

The rhyme is usually supposed to have been written sometime in the late 18th or early 19th century by an English visitor to North Wales. The specific number of wonders may have varied over the years: the antiquary Daines Barrington, in a letter written in 1770, refers to Llangollen Bridge as one of the &quot;five wonders of Wales, though like the seven wonders of Dauphiny, they turn out to be no wonders at all out of the Principality&quot;.

<text>The original St. Johns River Bridge was a four-lane concrete-and-steel causeway bridge constructed over the St. Johns River at the west outlet of Lake Monroe. It is a part of Interstate 4, and spans the border between Seminole and Volusia Counties in Florida, United States. On the Seminole side is Sanford and on the Volusia side is DeBary.

The bridge&#x27;s design, which lacked shoulders for disabled or wrecked vehicles to pull out of the flow of traffic, made it a severe bottleneck for commuters going to the Orlando Area beginning in the 1980s. A series of fatal traffic collisions on it and similarly-designed bridges statewide, most notably the Interstate 75 Lake Panasoffkee Bridge, led to a move in 2000 to use state emergency bridge funds similar to the contingency funds used to rebuild the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to begin planned reconstruction. Work began in 2001, and a new dual structure consisting of two three-lane spans, each with wide shoulders on either side, was fully opened in May 2004. The old bridge was dismantled over the next few months. Upon completion, the new structure was officially renamed the St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge.

<text>The Battle of Kuningtou or Battle of Guningtou (), also known as the Battle of Kinmen (), was fought over Kinmen in the Taiwan Strait during the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The failure of the Communists to take the island left it in the hands of the Kuomintang (Nationalists) and crushed their chances of taking Taiwan to destroy the Nationalists completely in the war.

==Prelude==
Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek began withdrawing its forces from mainland China to Taiwan. However, ROC garrisons remained stationed on the islands of Quemoy (Kinmen) and Matsu, located off the coast in Fujian Province. Commanders of the PRC People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) believed that Quemoy (Kinmen) and Matsu had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. The PLA planned to attack Kinmen from nearby Aotou () (in Xindian, Xiamen), Dadeng (Tateng) and Lianhe (Lienho) () (then part of Nan&#x27;an County, now also in Xindian) by launching a first attack with 9,000 troops to establish a beachhead, before landing a second force of roughly 10,000 on Greater Kinmen Island, expecting to take the entire island in three days from an ROC garrison not expected to be larger than two divisions. The Communists had incorrectly estimated that there were only 12,000 Nationalist soldiers on the entire island, and believed they consisted of green recruits and demoralized remnants of conscripted units that had survived defeats in central China – a miscalculation that would contribute to their calamitous defeat.

Expecting that a PLA attack was imminent, ROC commanders ordered the immediate construction of fortifications. By October, ROC troops had laid 7,455 land mines, and constructed roughly 200 earthen bunkers on the shores of Kinmen, as well as several anti-amphibious landing beach obstacles. The ROC garrison on Kinmen was also reinforced with armor (1st Battalion, 3rd Tank Regiment, which were veterans of Burma campaign, consisting of 22 M5A1 Stuart light tanks organized into two tank companies), battle-hardened infantry, and supplies from the 12th Army. In the opening hours of October 25, the PLA&#x27;s armada (consisting of hundreds of wooden fishing boats) set sail for Kinmen. They intended to land near the village of Longkou on the narrowest part of the island. But due to the crudeness of their craft, choppy waters and winds, many of them were scattered and carried past Longkou and northwestwards toward the shore of Guningtou instead.

In October 1949, the islands were home to approximately forty thousand residents. Despite its small size, Quemoy&#x27;s strategic significance lay in its remarkably close proximity to the mainland. This geographical proximity positioned Quemoy as a critical outpost for controlling maritime access to Xiamen and its adjacent coastal areas, making it strategically vital for the Nationalist government&#x27;s retreat to Taiwan.

==Battle==
===October 25===
Around 01:30 on October 25, a Nationalist patrol accidentally set off one of the land mines. The blast alerted other units all along the northern shore and the PLA&#x27;s quiet approach to Kinmen was compromised. Immediately, flares were fired into the air by ROC troops and searchlights swept the area, which brightly illuminated the PLA&#x27;s fleet and led to their discovery by the Nationalists.

At the time of the discovery, a tank squadron consisting of Tanks 64 and 65, were guarding a tank receiving maintenance (having been stuck in sand the evening prior). Upon seeing the illuminated PLA attack force, the soldiers began returning fire with the tanks. According to reported accounts, an ammunition ship was one of the first hit by ROC tank fire, resulting in a fire that burned neighboring landing craft.

At about 02:00 when the tide had begun to recede, PLA troops from regiments 244, 251, and 253 landed on the north side of Greater Kinmen Island at Guningtou (Ku-ning-t&#x27;ou, ), Huwei (湖尾) and Longkou (壟口). Regiment 244 was the first ashore landing near Lungkou where Nationalist defenders raked them with machine-gun fire, artillery, and mortars. They suffered heavy casualties. Regiments 251 and 253 fared better, landing near Guningtou and Huwei respectively where they broke through ROC defenses and continued to head inland.

Arriving at high tide, many of the PLA landing vessels became caught on submerged anti-amphibious landing beach obstacles and immobilized. When the tide went out, the PLA landing vessels became beached and were unable to return to the mainland to transport the second wave of reinforcements. Although these Communists were initially supported by artillery fire from the mainland, it had to cease firing once the infantry disembarked. Some of the troops, stranded in their vulnerable landing craft still far from shore, had to swim or wade some 650 yards (600 meters) in order to reach the shore, also rendering them without cover and extremely vulnerable to the defenders&#x27; fire. The beached PLA vessels were destroyed shortly afterwards by gunfire from two ROC Navy vessels patrolling off the northwest coast of Guningtou, strafing runs by ROCAF P-51s, as well as by ROC troops who burned the mostly wooden boats using flamethrowers, grenades, gasoline, and oil.

The advancing PLA forces were met by the ROC 18th Army and US-made M5A1 tanks of ROC 1st Bn, 3rd Tank Regiment. PLA Regiment 244 held high ground at Shuangru Hill (雙乳山), but were beaten back by ROC armor by early morning. PLA Regiment 253 holding Guanyin Hill (觀音山) and the Huwei Highlands (湖尾高地) were also forced to fall back by 12:00 after an overwhelming ROC counterattack of infantry, tanks, and soldiers with flamethrowers, and supported by mortars and artillery. The PLA troops were attacked from three sides. PLA Regiment 251 managed to break out of an ROC encirclement and entered the village of Guningtou, and dug in at Lincuo (林厝). Shortly afterwards, Regiment 251 was attacked by the ROC 14th and 118th divisions, with the ROC 118th division suffering heavy casualties. By the end of the day, the PLA had lost its beachheads at Huwei and Lungkou.

===October 26===
At 03:00 on October 26, around 1,000 troops in 4 companies from PLA Regiment 246 and the 85th division landed on Kinmen to reinforce PLA forces already on the island landing again at Huwei and Guningtou. At dawn, Regiment 246 managed to break through ROC forces surrounding the village of Guningtou, making a rendezvous with the surviving PLA troops taking cover in the town. At 06:30, the ROC 118th division launched a counterattack along the northern coast on PLA forces in Guningtou at Lincuo. The resulting battle was extremely bloody and soon turned into urban warfare in the streets and alleyways of Guningtou. With air support from P-47s and B-24s of the ROC Air Force, ROC forces eventually prevailed, taking Lincuo by noon and Nanshan (南山) at 3PM. Surviving PLA forces began falling back to the coast.

===October 27===
By the early morning of October 27, the surviving People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces had exhausted both their food and ammunition supplies. 1,300 PLA troops retreated to the beaches north of Guningtou. After a final ROC assault, the remaining PLA troops surrendered to ROC forces at 10:00 on that day. All of the PLA troops who had landed on Kinmen were either killed or captured.

==Aftermath==
Following the failure at Guningtou, PLA General Ye Fei submitted an official apology to Mao Zedong asking to be punished for his failure. General Ye attributed the failure of the operation to three factors: an insufficient number of landing vessels, failure to properly secure the beachheads, and the lack of an overall commanding officer to oversee the three regiments involved in the first wave. As Ye was one of Mao&#x27;s favorite generals, Mao never took any action against him.

For ROC forces accustomed to continuous defeats against the PLA on the mainland, the victory at Guningtou provided a much-needed morale boost. The failure of the PRC to take Kinmen effectively halted its advance towards Taiwan. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 and the signing of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty in 1954, the Communist plans to invade Taiwan were put on hold.

Due to the PLA&#x27;s defeat, the Battle of Guningtou was not widely publicized in the PRC until early in the 21st century when the publication of articles within the mainland examining reasons for its failure was widely distributed. The army generally concluded that its lack of amphibious landing experience, lack of sophisticated landing craft, lack of armor, low attack-repelling ability, lack of international recognition, and lack of intelligence services contributed to their defeat. As they had expected to win the battle after one day of fighting, they therefore did not bring enough ammunition, supplies, food, and water, on the first wave and also to a lesser degree during the second day&#x27;s invasion. The battle is seen as being highly significant in Taiwan, as it laid the foundation for the current &quot;status quo&quot; relationship between Taiwan and mainland China.

==ROC defenses at the landing site==
The M5A1 tanks employed by the ROC forces on Kinmen proved to be effective in countering the human wave attacks employed by the initial PLA landing forces, which were mostly composed of light infantry. ROC tank crews who had depleted their ammunition used their tanks as road rollers to crush PLA infantry. The pivotal role these tanks played caused ROC troops to give the M5A1 the nickname &quot;Bear of Kinmen&quot; (金門之熊). The PLA&#x27;s initial landing force of the 244th regiment at Longkou (壟口) was met by three tanks (#64, #65, #66) of the 1st platoon, 3rd company of the ROC 1st Battalion, 3rd Tank Regiment. The #66 tank had broken down on the beach the previous evening after company exercises, and the other two tanks in the platoon had been ordered to stay and guard it while repairs were attempted.

The ROC Navy tank landing ship ROCS &quot;Chung Lung&quot; (中榮) was anchored near the PLA&#x27;s landing site on October 25, and used its significant firepower (2x2 40mm guns, 6x1 40mm guns, 8x1 20mm guns) to destroy beached PLA landing craft, again made up mostly of wooden junks and fishing boats, during the battle. &quot;Chung Lung&quot; was supposed to leave on the evening of October 24 after offloading its cargo, but remained, offering an official excuse of &quot;bad weather&quot;. The unmentioned real reason the ship remained in the area was that it was running a side business of smuggling brown sugar from Taiwan island in exchange for peanut oil. However, there was not enough peanut oil on the whole island for the deal, so the ship was forced to stay for another day while waiting for more peanut oil to be produced, making it the accidental hero of the battle.

The battle also saw one of the few instances of combined-arms warfare from ROC forces. The ROCA 45th Division that formed part of Kinmen&#x27;s defense garrison were formerly a ROCAF airfield security brigade and was both equipped with specialized radio equipment and supported by forward air controllers from the ROCAF, giving the division the ability to directly coordinate with ROCAF aircraft operating over the island. The division&#x27;s commander, on his own initiative, organized air support that arrived before dawn and from his command post ordered airstrikes on PLA landing craft and transport ships off shore. This contributed to stranding of PLA forces already landed on the island.

== Legacy ==
In 1984, the soldiers and the fallen were memorialized in the Guningtou Battle Museum. The M5A1 tanks used the battle were also memorialized, displayed outside the museum.

In Taiwan, the battle was called “The Great Victory at Guningtou” (). Later views on the battle reflect a nuanced understanding of its significance and outcome. Government reports and scholarly analyses highlighted Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s strategic foresight and the KMT&#x27;s preparedness as key factors in the victory over the PLA. While acknowledging tactical errors by the PLA, newer perspectives also emphasize the role of &quot;coincidences&quot; that favored the KMT, such as the accidental triggering of a landmine and the sudden revival of malfunctioning tanks. Despite differing interpretations, these analyses underscore the enduring legacy of the battle as a testament to the importance of preparation and readiness in military endeavors.

<doc id="1218351" wikidata="Q561353" url="?curid=1218351" title="Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius">
<text>Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius, also known as Palladius Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus or most often just as Palladius, was an ancient writer who wrote in Latin, and is dated variously to the later 4th century or first half of the 5th century AD. He is principally known for his book on agriculture, &quot;Opus agriculturae&quot;, sometimes known as &quot;De re rustica&quot;.
==Life==
Since the Middle Ages, authors of agricultural treatises have referred often to Palladius. The Palladii were a prominent Gallic family, and the name &quot;Palladius&quot; is probably a family name (of Greek origin), with Aemilianus his &quot;cognomen&quot; (of Roman origin). In late antiquity, the convention of the &quot;tria nomina&quot; (&quot;three names&quot;) for Roman men was no longer standard, and the greater variation in naming practice contributes to the uncertainty over the correct order of his names. Evidence for his life is scant. Manuscripts of his work call him a &quot;vir illustris&quot;, which would indicate high rank. Although Palladius relies heavily on earlier agricultural writers, he himself owned farms in Italy and Sardinia, and had considerable experience of farming, with a special interest in fruit trees.
==Works==
The &quot;Opus agriculturae&quot; is a treatise on farming in 14 parts or books, written in the late fourth or early fifth century AD. The first book is general and introductory. Books 2 to 13 give detailed instructions for the typical activities on a Roman farm for each month of the year, starting with January. Each of these calendrical books has sections on field crops, vegetable gardens, fruit trees and other trees, and livestock. The fourteenth book, &quot;De Veterinaria Medicina&quot;, was rediscovered only in the 20th century, and gives instructions for the care of animals and elements of veterinary science. All of this is in prose, but Palladius also appended a poem, &quot;De Insitione&quot;, On Grafting, consisting of eighty-five couplets of elegiac verse.

Palladius&#x27; work stands in the tradition of Roman agricultural treatises, represented particularly by Marcus Priscus Cato, Marcus Terentius Varro, Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella, and Gargilius Martialis. His chief contribution was to reduce the exhaustive works of Columella and Martialis to an appropriate scale for the practical farmer, while at the same time re-organising them on a calendrical basis, to provide the farmer with a checklist of the tasks needing attention each month.

The work of Palladius was well known in the Middle Ages. A translation into Middle English verse survives from about 1420, entitled &quot;On Husbondrie&quot;; it can be seen as part of a genre of instructional agricultural writing that was to develop in England into works such as those of Thomas Tusser and Gervase Markham. Two notable thirteenth century works that draw on Palladius are the &quot;Commoda ruralia&quot; of Petrus de Crescentius, written and printed at Augsburg in 1471; and the &quot;Speculum Maius&quot; of Vincentius Bellovacensis (Vincent de Beauvais) written about 1250 and first printed in Strasbourg in 1473–76. There are a number of other &quot;incunabula&quot; or early editions.

===Water-mills===
The book is known for reference to a water-mill in Book 1, ch. 41, where Palladius suggests that waste water from bath buildings should be used to drive a mill. Such mills had been described by Vitruvius in 25 BC, and there is a growing number of examples of such Roman water-mills. The most spectacular is the set of 16 mills at Barbegal in southern France, using water fed by a stone aqueduct along the line of the same aqueduct which supplied nearby Arles.

==Principal early editions==

The earliest editions of Palladius group his works with those on agriculture of Cato the Elder, Varro and Columella. Some modern library catalogues follow Brunet in listing these under &quot;Rei rusticae scriptores&quot; or &quot;Scriptores rei rusticae&quot;.

<text>Teodorico &quot;Teo&quot; Fabi (born 9 March 1955) is an Italian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . In sportscar racing, Fabi won the World Sportscar Championship in 1991 with Jaguar.

Born and raised in Milan, Fabi is the older brother of former Formula One driver Corrado Fabi. He claimed pole position in his rookie year at the 1983 Indianapolis 500. At the 1984 Indianapolis 500, Fabi became the last active Formula One driver to race at the event until Fernando Alonso in 2017.

==Early racing==
Fabi was European Karting Champion in 1975 and followed that up with the European Formula Ford 1600 title in 1977.

==Open wheel racing==

===Formula car racing===

====European Formula Three====
Fabi competed in European Formula Three in 1978 for Forti Corse in a March-Toyota. He contested seven races for wins at Circuit Zolder, Dijon-Prenois and Autodromo Vallelunga Piero Taruffi. He finished fourth in points with 45.

====European Formula Two====
Fabi then competed in European Formula Two in for March Racing in a March 792-BMW. His best finish was second at Circuit Park Zandvoort. He scored 13 points overall.

Fabi returned to the series in for the ICI Roloil Racing Team in a March 802-BMW. He scored three wins, at the Jim Clark Rennen at Hockenheimring, the Eifelrennen at Nürburgring and the Preis Baden-Württemberg at Hockenheimring. He qualified on pole at the Grote Prijs van België Formel 2 at Circuit Zolder and the Preis Baden-Württemberg at Hockenheimring, and set fastest lap in the latter on the way to a victory. Fabi ended the season third in points, with 38 points.

====Formula One====
Fabi moved to Formula One in 1982, driving the No. 36 Candy Toleman TG181C-Hart 415T. The team had only qualified twice the previous year, and the season got off to a difficult start when the season-opening South African Grand Prix was disrupted by a drivers&#x27; strike. Under pressure from Toleman manager Alex Hawkridge, Fabi was the only driver to break the strike (Jochen Mass took no part from the start). His place was then jeopardised when Candy switched support to Tyrrell, but he saw out the season. The TG181C was uncompetitive and the team largely focused on lead driver Derek Warwick. This resulted in Fabi only qualifying for six races out of a possible 14. He qualified for the San Marino Grand Prix, due to the FISA–FOCA war which meant that only 14 cars attempted to qualify for the race. In the race Fabi finished seventh, eight laps down. Fabi qualified for the Belgian Grand Prix, starting and finishing twenty-first. He then failed to qualify at the Monaco Grand Prix before skipping both the Detroit Grand Prix and the Canadian Grand Prix. He failed to qualify at the German Grand Prix and the Caesars Palace Grand Prix. His best finish in the remaining races was twentieth at the Austrian Grand Prix, and he left Formula One at the end of the season.

Fabi&#x27;s Indy car season in 1983 rekindled Formula One teams&#x27; interest. With help from Italian dairy company Parmalat, which insisted on having an Italian driver in the team, he joined MRD International in 1984 to drive the No. 2 Brabham BT53-BMW M12 as the number two driver to reigning World Champion Nelson Piquet. He also continued to drive in the CART/PPG World Series for Forsythe Racing and missed three Grands Prix. In those races his younger brother, Corrado Fabi, drove in his place. The mixed approach led to disappointing results in both categories and mid-season saw Fabi decide to concentrate solely on Formula One. Prior to the change, Fabi&#x27;s best finish was ninth at the 1984 French Grand Prix and his best start was a sixth at the South African Grand Prix. His performances improved, including a strong run at Italian Grand Prix where he ran second behind Piquet in the first half of the race before retiring with engine failure, the major problem for Brabham during the year. Fabi scored points on three occasions, with a best finish of third at the Detroit Grand Prix and was twelfth in points with nine.

Brabham dropped Fabi for 1985 and he initially struggled to find a team. His profile in Italy allowed him to rejoin Toleman (now heavily sponsored by the Benetton Group) when they belatedly joined the championship at the Monaco Grand Prix. Fabi drove the No. 19 Toleman Motorsports Group Toleman TG185-Hart 415T. The season got off to a late start because Toleman had lost their supply of tyres when Michelin pulled out of F1 at the end of 1984. They could not access Goodyear tyres and Pirelli would not supply them as they had broken a contract with the Italian company in mid-1984 and gone with Michelin. Benetton bought both Toleman and the Spirit team and transferred Spirit&#x27;s Pirelli contract to Toleman. The late start meant the TG185 was never truly reliable, but Fabi&#x27;s speed lead to the marque&#x27;s only pole position, at the German Grand Prix, at the new Nürburgring. Fabi&#x27;s race was ruined when a slipping clutch meant he was well down the order at the end of the first lap. The team failed to score any points and Fabi only finished twice (even these races were disrupted by mechanical problems). 1980 World Champion Alan Jones (who also used a Hart engine in his Haas Lola) described it late in the season as &quot;sending a boy to do a man&#x27;s job&quot; in F1 against the likes of Renault, Ferrari, BMW, Honda and TAG-Porsche. Fabi&#x27;s best finish was twelfth at the Italian Grand Prix and he would again go unranked due to not scoring points.

Fabi drove for Benetton Formula in the No. 19 Benetton B186-BMW M12 after Toleman were fully taken over before the 1986 season to become Benetton, with powerful ( qualifying) engines, and talented young Austrian Gerhard Berger joining. The Benetton was fast but fragile with difficult Pirelli tyres and Fabi often qualified better than he raced. He managed pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix and the Italian Grand Prix but his best finish was fifth at the Spanish Grand Prix. He gained a reputation for being most competitive on faster circuits and struggling on slower, more technical courses. Both pole positions were at the two fastest circuits on the 1986 calendar, the Österreichring and the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. He ended the season fifteenth in points.

Fabi continued at Benetton Formula in 1987, driving the No. 19 B187-Ford Cosworth GBA V6 and was joined by Thierry Boutsen. While the package was not as fast, it was more consistent, allowing him to score points on five occasions. The Ford V6 suffered from unreliability early in the season due to the use of higher turbo boost in an effort to keep up with the Honda-powered cars from Williams and Lotus and the TAG-engined McLarens. When the boost was reduced from around mid-year, reliability returned but speed was sacrificed. Fabi had a best finish of third, at the Austrian Grand Prix, held at one of Fabi&#x27;s favourite tracks, the Österreichring. During the season Benetton signed young Italian charger Alessandro Nannini, for the 1988 season to partner Boutsen. In Fabi&#x27;s final Formula One race, at the Australian Grand Prix, he took his frustration of not being able to find a drive for 1988 out on Boutsen, spending many laps deliberately blocking his teammate and not letting himself be lapped despite the blue flags and orders from the team to move over. When Boutsen confronted Fabi after the race, the Italian angrily told him to &quot;come back and see me when you have a pole position&quot;. (Boutsen was third in this race, and ended his career following the 1993 season with three wins and one pole position). Fabi ended the season ranked a career-best ninth.

Fabi competed in 71 Formula One Grands Prix. He scored three pole positions, two fastest laps and two thirds in his career, scoring a total of 23 points.

===Indy car racing===

====Champ Car World Series====
Fabi joined the CART/PPG World Series in 1983 for Forsythe Racing in the No. 33 Skoal Bandit March 83C-Cosworth DFX. He made his Indy car debut at the Kraco Dixie 200 at Atlanta International Speedway, starting ninth and finishing twentieth after retiring after 41 laps due to suspension failure. 
At the Indianapolis 500 Fabi qualified on pole with a track record speed of 207.395 mph for four laps, and a one-lap record of 208.049 mph. In the process he became the first rookie to qualify on the pole position since Walt Faulkner in 1950. He led 23 of the first 47 laps before retiring during his second pit stop due to a broken fuel filter. Fabi was credited with twenty-sixth place and won the rookie of the year award. Fabi then qualified with pole position at the Dana Rex Mays Classic at the Wisconsin State Fairgrounds Park Speedway and finished fourth. He won the Domino&#x27;s Pizza 500 at Pocono International Raceway and then the Escort Radar Warnings 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. He moved into second place in the championship behind veteran Al Unser He then won the Cribari Wines 300K at Laguna Seca Raceway and the championship was decided at the season-ending Miller High Life 150 at Phoenix International Raceway Fabi won pole position, led 138 of 150 laps and won the race to score 22 points. Unser finished fourth for 16 points and took the championship. Fabi won the series&#x27; rookie of the year award.

In 1984 Fabi returned with Forsythe Racing in their No. 33 Skoal Bandit March 84C-Cosworth DFX. He qualified third at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach and was second at the Dana Jimmy Bryan 150 at Phoenix International Raceway. He was eighteenth and nineteenth due to a crash at Long Beach and a blown engine at Phoenix. At the Indianapolis 500 Fabi qualified fourteenth and retired in twenty-fourth place due to a fuel system failure after 104 laps and leading for 14 laps. His best finish was third at the Stroh&#x27;s/G.I. Joe&#x27;s 200 at Portland International Raceway. Following the Budweiser Cleveland Grand Prix Fabi left Indy car racing to concentrate on the Formula One season. Fabi ended his partial season twenty-fifth in points.
Brabham dropped Fabi for 1985
Fabi returned to Indy car racing in 1988 with Porsche Motorsports in their No. 8 Quaker State March 88P-Porsche Indy V8. The Porsche engine was less competitive than the Ilmor-Chevrolet and Cosworth engines. Despite the setbacks Fabi managed a best finish of fourth at the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Pennsylvania International Raceway. Fabi&#x27;s return to the Indianapolis 500 was also a disappointment as he qualified seventeenth and finished thirtieth after losing a wheel after 30 laps. He ended the season ranked tenth with 44 points.

In 1989 Fabi drove the No. 8 Quaker State March 89P-Porsche Indy V8. The engine and team began to compete regularly for wins with Fabi qualifying on pole at the Budweiser/G.I. Joe&#x27;s 200 at Portland International Raceway and the Red Roof Inns 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course where he led for 71 of 84 laps to get what would be his last Indy car victory. The engine also began to be competitive on the ovals, as highlighted by a second at the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway. At the Indianapolis 500 Fabi qualified thirteenth and again finished thirtieth after retiring due to ignition problems after 23 laps. After his Mid-Ohio victory Fabi moved into third place in points. At the final two races of the season, the Firestone Indy 225 at Pennsylvania International Raceway and the Champion Spark Plug 300K at Laguna Seca Raceway, Fabi retired due to handling issues at Nazareth and a crash at Laguna Seca. At the end of the season he was fourth with 141 points.
Fabi returned with Porsche Motorsports in 1990 to drive their No. 4 Foster&#x27;s-Quaker State March 90P-Porsche Indy V8. Prior to the start of the season Porsche was going to build an all carbon fibre chassis with their constructor, March Engineering. In January, Porsche&#x27;s competitors voted against the use of the car and as a result Porsche had to use the year-old March 89P chassis. Fabi qualified seventh at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on the but finished tenth. A new March 90P was used at the Indianapolis 500 and Fabi started twenty-third and retired in eighteenth due to transmission problems after 162 laps. Fabi later qualified on pole position for the Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Denver.He led one lap but crashed after seven laps and finished twenty-seventh. Fabi achieved a best finish of third, at the Marlboro Grand Prix at the Meadowlands, at Meadowlands Sports Complex, and ended the season fourteenth in points. At the end of the season Porsche withdrew from Indy car racing so Fabi moved to the World Sportscar Championship in 1991 and won the championship.

In 1992 Fabi drove at the ITT Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit at Belle Isle Park to substitute for Mario Andretti who suffered injuries at the Indianapolis 500. He drove for Newman-Haas Racing in their No. 2 Texaco Havoline/K Mart Lola T92/00-Ford Cosworth XB. He qualified third and finished sixth.

Fabi moved to Hall VDS Racing for 1993 in the No. 8 Pennzoil Lola T93/00-Ilmor-Chevrolet Indy V8 265C, achieving a best finish of fourth at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. After the race Fabi was third in points, 10 points out of the lead behind Nigel Mansell and Mario Andretti. At the Indianapolis 500 Fabi started seventeenth and finished ninth. After Long Beach his best finish was sixth, at the Marlboro 500, at Michigan International Speedway. Fabi ended up eleventh with 64 points.

For 1994 Fabi drove for the re-organized Hall Racing (VDS Racing withdrew from the team following 1993) in the No. 11 Pennzoil Reynard 94i-Ilmor Indy V8. During the season Fabi&#x27;s best finishes were a trio of thirds, at the ITT Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit, the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway and the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America. Fabi qualified twenty-fourth for the Indianapolis 500 and finished seventh, his best result in the race. He was ninth in points with 79.

In 1995 Fabi returned with Forsythe Racing in the No. 33 Combustion Engineering/Indeck Reynard 95i-Ford Cosworth XB. He had a best finish of third, at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. At the Indianapolis 500 Fabi started fifteenth and finished eighth. Fabi won pole at the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at the Milwaukee Mile, led for 27 laps but finished fourth, two laps down. At the New England 200 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway Fabi qualified second and led for 42 laps, only to finish twelfth, four laps down. He also started second at the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway, and finished fourth. He ended the season ninth with 83 points.

Fabi was unable to get a car to drive for 1996 as Forsythe Racing hired Indy Lights driver Greg Moore. He was to drive for PacWest Racing in their No. 18 Motorola Reynard 96i-Ford Cosworth XD to replace Mark Blundell, who was injured at the IndyCar Rio 400 at Autódromo de Jacarepaguá. He did compete in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach and the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth Speedway. In both races he qualified nineteenth, and finished eighteenth at Long Beach. Blundell returned for the U.S. 500 at Michigan International Speedway and Fabi was withdrawn from the car. Fabi scored no points for the first time in his career and finished thirty-sixth.

==Sports car racing==

===Can-Am===
Fabi competed in Can-Am in 1981 for Newman Freeman Racing in their No. 6 Budweiser March 817-Chevrolet V8. He took four wins, at Mosport Park (twice), Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and Laguna Seca Raceway. He finish second in points with 456 points.

===World Sportscar Championship===
Fabi began competing in the World Sportscar Championship in 1980 for Scuderia Lancia Corse in the No. 51 Lancia Beta Monte Carlo-Lancia 1.4L Turbo I4 for the Group 5 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Hans Heyer and Bernard Darniche. In the race, the car started twenty-sixth but retired after six laps with oil pump failure.

He returned to the series in 1982 for Martini Racing in the No. 51 Lancia LC1-Lancia 1.4L Turbo I4. Fabi would win the 1000km of Nürburgring at the Nürburgring with Michele Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese. Fabi also competed in the Group 6 class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the same car with Alboreto and Rolf Stommelen. The car qualified fourth but finished thirty-fourth after retiring on their ninety-second lap due to engine failure. He ended the season ranked fourth with 66 points.

In 1983 Fabi drove the No. 4 Martini Porsche 956 in the No. 4 Lancia LC2-Ferrari 268C 2.6L Turbo V8. He won the 1000km of Imola at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari with Hans Heyer. The team eventually had involvement from Lancia and the car became a Lancia LC2-Lancia 268C 2.6L Turbo V8 and he drove this car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Michele Alboreto and Alessandro Nannini in the C Class. The car started second but finished forty-sixth after retiring after 27 laps with gearbox failure. Fabi then drove the team&#x27;s second car, No. 5 which started fourth and finished thirty-sixth after retiring after 121 laps due to fuel pressure problems. Fabi&#x27;s win at Imola did not count towards the World Endurance Championship for Drivers and as a result he was unranked in the championship.

After the 1990 IndyCar season proved to be a backward step he returned to the series in 1991 with Tom Walkinshaw Racing/Silk Cut Jaguar in the No. 34 Jaguar XJR-12 and Jaguar XJR-14. Fabi won the Castrol BRDC Empire Trophy at the Silverstone Circuit with Derek Warwick. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the team&#x27;s Jaguar XJR-12-Jaguar 7.4L V12 with Bob Wollek and Kenny Acheson for the C2 class. In the race the car started twenty-seventh and finished third with 358 laps complete. Fabi went on to win the World Endurance Championship for Drivers with 86 points.

Fabi competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for Toyota Team Tom&#x27;s in the No. 8 Toyota TS010-Toyota RV10 3.5L V10 with Jan Lammers and Andy Wallace in the C1 Class. They started fourth and finished eighth, with 331 laps completed, and fifth in class. Fabi ended the season twenty-seventh in points with eight points.

===1993 24 Hours of Le Mans===
The 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans was held without a championship for points to go to after the collapse of the World Sportscar Championship and as a result the race was run as a standalone event. Fabi drove for Peugeot Talbot Sport in their No. 1 Peugeot 905 Evo 1B-Peugeot SA35 3.5L V10 with Thierry Boutsen and Yannick Dalmas in the C1 Class. They started and finished second overall, with 374 laps completed, and were also second in class.

<doc id="1218377" wikidata="Q171456" url="?curid=1218377" title="Adrián Campos">
<text>Adrián Campos Suñer (17 June 1960 – 27 January 2021) was a Spanish Formula One driver. He participated in 21 Grands Prix, debuting on 12 April 1987, without scoring a championship point. He later moved into team management, with more success. He was the founder of the Campos Meta Formula One team (later known as HRT), which competed in Formula One from 2010 to 2012. He founded Campos Racing in 1998.

==Racing career==

===Early years===
Campos&#x27; first success was in radio-controlled car racing, winning the Spanish Championship in 1980. He switched to car racing a year later, and competed in Formula Three from 1983 to 1985, finishing 3rd in the 1985 German Championship. He raced in Formula 3000 in the 1986 season, with modest success.

===Formula One===
Having done some testing for Tyrrell in 1986, Campos raced in the and F1 seasons for the Minardi team, alongside first Alessandro Nannini and then compatriot Luis Pérez-Sala. He only completed two of the 21 races he entered, although more of these were due to mechanical failures than driver errors. However, these retirements caused him to lose his motivation and in 1988, he was replaced by Pierluigi Martini after failing to qualify in three consecutive races.

===After Formula One===
Campos competed in Spanish Touring Cars, winning the championship in 1994. 1997 would be the last year Campos would spend as a professional driver. After some races in sports prototypes such as the Ferrari 333 SP, he would go on to form his own team as an owner.

==Team management==

After leaving Formula One, Campos was successfully involved in team management. He founded Adrian Campos Motorsport (later renamed Campos Racing) in 1998, with Marc Gené winning the 1998 Euro Open by Nissan championship in the championship&#x27;s first year before immediately reaching Formula One. He also managed Fernando Alonso in his early years.

Campos Racing entered the GP2 series when it was launched for 2005. Two fifth places were the best results that year. The team opened 2006 with a podium at Valencia for Adrian Valles, but neither he nor fellow Spaniard Félix Porteiro scored another podium all year (Portiero was second on the road at Silverstone, but a steering rack irregularity caused him to be disqualified).

The signing of veteran Giorgio Pantano for 2007 led the team forward, with Pantano scoring two victories and 3rd overall, and teammate Vitaly Petrov winning at the season finale at Valencia. For 2008 Petrov remained, with Ben Hanley replaced in the second car by Lucas di Grassi after three rounds. Di Grassi immediately recaptured his 2007 form, with three second places in his first four starts, and subsequent wins at the Hungaroring and the new Valencia Street Circuit - which represented a double for the team, as Petrov won race one, having scored just one other podium all year. The Campos team won the 2008 Teams&#x27; Championship. In October 2008, Campos announced that he planned to step down from running the GP2 team and to sell his stake in it, but would still remain involved in F3 and a new project that was unspecified. The GP2 team was taken over by Alejandro Agag and renamed Barwa Addax.

===Formula One===
Campos had been linked to a move into Formula One, and he considered buying the assets of the defunct Super Aguri team. In May 2009, Campos Grand Prix lodged an entry for the 2010 Formula One season, which was one of four to be accepted. The entry was successful along with Lotus F1, Manor GP &amp; US F1. The team, which was soon renamed to Campos Meta, confirmed on 30 October 2009 that Bruno Senna, who is Ayrton Senna&#x27;s nephew, would be one of their drivers on the grid in 2010.

In February 2010, with the Campos team struggling financially, a rescue deal was completed whereby shareholder José Ramón Carabante took over full control of the team. As part of the restructuring, Campos was replaced as team principal by Colin Kolles. The team was renamed Hispania Racing (or HRT F1), with Campos taking the role of executive vice-president.

==Personal life==
His maternal grandfather Luis Suñer was a noted industrialist in Spain. His father founded the Avidesa frozen food company. He has a son whose name is also Adrián Campos Jr.

Campos died on 27 January 2021, aged 60, due to an aortic dissection.

Campos&#x27; home circuit of Circuit Ricardo Tormo has named its final turn after Campos.

<doc id="1218382" wikidata="Q5138019" url="?curid=1218382" title="Coalpit Heath">
<text>Coalpit Heath is a small village in the civil parish of Westerleigh and Coalpit Heath, in the South Gloucestershire district, in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England, south of Yate and east of Frampton Cotterell.

==Background==

Due to the expansion of Coalpit Heath and the neighbouring villages in the late 20th century, the borders of Coalpit Heath with Frampton Cotterell have become vague. The village contains three pubs, one post office, a 27-hole golf course (The Kendleshire), and a few local shops. The village also includes a parish church, and a local primary school, The Manor CofE VC Primary school.

It was founded as a coal mining settlement. One pit was on Frog Lane at ST 685 815 (to the north east of the village). Other mines operated between Mays Hill and Nibley to the north and at Ram Hill and Henfield to the south. These were served by a railway line, closed some decades ago and no longer visible on the ground. In 1949 the coal ran out, and since then it has become a sought after place to live, with fields and easy accommodation. The South Gloucestershire Mines Research Group (SGMRG) has done a lot of research into the history of mining in the area. When the Kendleshire golf course was built, the remains of many bell pits were found and there are probably many more in the area.

Frampton Cotterell lies along the northwest border, but the rest of the village is surrounded by the rolling Cotswold countryside, stocked full of wildlife and country pursuits.

St. Saviour&#x27;s Church lies within the village. It was designed by William Butterfield in 1844 and was his first Anglican Church.

Amenities used and supported by the village include Bitterwell Lake at Henfield and Coalpit Heath Cricket Club at Ram Hill.

==Coalpit Heath in literature==

A number of sources, including Frank Barrett&#x27;s book &quot;Where Was Wonderland? A Traveller&#x27;s Guide to the Settings of Classic Children&#x27;s Books&quot;, cite Coalpit Heath as the setting for the Dick King Smith children&#x27;s book &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot;, later adapted for film as &quot;Babe&quot;.

The South Gloucestershire Mines Research Group have written two books (more to be published soon) on Coalpit Heath and the surrounding area, including &quot;Frog Lane&quot; and &quot;Kingswood Coal&quot;.

<doc id="1218383" wikidata="Q173197" url="?curid=1218383" title="Aguri Suzuki">
<text>is a Japanese former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to .

Suzuki entered 88 Formula One Grands Prix, achieving a best result of third at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, becoming the first Asian driver to score a podium finish. He also won the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship in 1988, and later finished third overall at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1998. He was also a race-winner in the All-Japan GT Championship.

He became involved in team ownership after his Formula One career, first forming Autobacs Racing Team Aguri (ARTA) in 1997 in partnership with Autobacs. ARTA has competed mostly in Super GT, where they have won titles in both the GT500 and GT300 classes. He was the owner of the Super Aguri F1 team, which participated in Formula One from to . He also formed Team Aguri, which raced in Formula E from 2014 to 2016.

==Early life==
Aguri Suzuki was born in Tokyo; his father Masashi Suzuki was of mixed ancestry from Japan and Martinique. Masashi Suzuki had worked as an aircraft technician for Honda Airways, and in 1973 established a go-cart shop. 

Aguri was named after the main character in the Kuri-chan comic strip. He attended Josai University majoring in the sciences, but did not complete his degree.

==Racing career==

===Early career===
Suzuki began racing karts in 1972, at the age of 12. In 1978 he won the Japanese kart championship and in 1979 made his debut in the Japanese Formula Three (All-Japan F3) championship. He continued in karting and in 1981 was again Japanese Kart Champion. In 1983 he finished second in the All-Japan F3 series, driving a Hayashi-Toyota. He then turned to touring car racing and, driving for the Nissan factory team won the Japanese title in 1986. The same year he made his debut in Japanese F2 and drove in the Le Mans 24 Hours. In 1987 he finished runner-up in the Japanese F3000 series, winning one race (Suzuka). In 1988, driving a March-Yamaha he won the title with three wins (Fuji, Nishi-Nippon and Suzuka).

===Formula One career===
In 1988, Suzuki raced in European F3000 with Footwork, before he debuted in Formula One on October 30 at his home race, replacing the ill Yannick Dalmas in the Larrousse-Lola. Zakspeed, who were using Yamaha engines, hired Suzuki for 1989, but he failed to pre-qualify in all 16 races.

For 1990 and 1991, he drove again for Larrousse. He finished sixth three times, before finishing third at Suzuka – the first ever podium for an Asian driver in F1. He also set the second-fastest lap.

In 1992 and 1993, he was at Footwork alongside Michele Alboreto and then Derek Warwick, but both usually outperformed him. He shared a Ligier with Martin Brundle in 1995, but only scored one point in his races, and was criticised by Mika Salo after the two collided in Buenos Aires. A massive crash in practice for the 1995 Japanese Grand Prix caused a neck injury which saw him miss the race, and he immediately announced his retirement.

Suzuki scored a total of eight championship points in F1. At the time he retired, he was the second most successful Japanese F1 driver after Satoru Nakajima in terms of points scored, but Takuma Sato and Kamui Kobayashi have since passed them both.

===After Formula One===

Suzuki later raced in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship, and remained involved in Japanese driver development. In 2000, with long-term sponsor Autobacs, he ran Autobacs Racing Team Aguri, which won the GT300 title in 2002, and expanded to Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters a season later. He also launched Super Aguri Fernandez Racing with Adrian Fernandez, running cars in the Indy Racing League.

==Team ownership==

From 2006 Suzuki ran the Super Aguri F1 Formula One team with the backing of Honda. He put his new team together in four and half months from his initial announcement on 1 November 2005. The team&#x27;s initial entry was rejected by the FIA after they failed to secure financial guarantees before the entry deadline, and their acceptance was not formally confirmed until 26 January 2006. The team made its debut at the Bahrain Grand Prix on 12 March 2006. In 2007, Takuma Sato scored two top-eight finishes, earning the team its first points, and Super Aguri ended up ninth in the Constructors&#x27; World Championship. On 6 May 2008, after competing in the opening four races of the season, the team withdrew from Formula One due to financial problems.

==Helmet==
Suzuki&#x27;s helmet is white with a red line with black sides surrounding the top, a red and black line going from the Rear down the chin (forming an A) and a black circle on the top.

<doc id="1218384" wikidata="Q698208" url="?curid=1218384" title="Reich Chancellery">
<text>The Reich Chancellery () was the traditional name of the office of the Chancellor of Germany (then called &quot;Reichskanzler&quot;) in the period of the German Reich from 1878 to 1945. The Chancellery&#x27;s seat, selected and prepared since 1875, was the former city palace of Adolf Friedrich Count von der Schulenburg (1685–1741) and later Prince Antoni Radziwiłł (1775–1833) on Wilhelmstraße in Berlin. Both the palace and a new Reich Chancellery building (completed in early 1939) were seriously damaged during World War II and subsequently demolished.

Today the office of the German chancellor is usually called &quot;Kanzleramt&quot; (Chancellor&#x27;s Office), or more formally &quot;Bundeskanzleramt&quot; (Federal Chancellor&#x27;s Office). The latter is also the name of the new seat of the Chancellor&#x27;s Office, completed in 2001.

== Old Reich Chancellery ==
When the military alliance of the North German Confederation was reorganised as a federal state with effect from July 1, 1867, the office of a Federal Chancellor &quot;(Bundeskanzler)&quot; was implemented at Berlin and staffed with the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck. After the unification of Germany on January 18, 1871, by accession of the South German states, Bismarck became Reich Chancellor of the new German Empire.

In 1869, the Prussian state government had acquired the Rococo city palace of late Prince Radziwiłł on Wilhelmstraße No. 77 (former &quot;Palais Schulenburg&quot;), which from 1875 was refurbished as the official building of the Chancellery. It was inaugurated with the meetings of the Berlin Congress in July 1878, followed by the Congo Conference in 1884.

In the days of the Weimar Republic the Chancellery was significantly enlarged by the construction of a Modern southern annex finished in 1930. In 1932/33, while his nearby office on Wilhelmstraße No. 73 was renovated, the building also served as the residence of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, where he appointed Adolf Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933. The Hitler Cabinet held few meetings here. In 1935, the architects Paul Troost and Leonhard Gall redesigned the interior as Hitler&#x27;s domicile. They also added a large reception hall/ballroom and conservatory, officially known as the &quot;Festsaal mit Wintergarten&quot; in the garden area. The latter addition was unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to an air-raid shelter known as the &quot;Vorbunker&quot;. Once completed in 1936, it was officially called the &quot;Reich Chancellery Air-Raid Shelter&quot; until 1943, with the construction to expand the bunker complex with the addition of the , located one level below. The two bunkers were connected by a stairway set at right angles which could be closed off from each other.

Devastated by air raids and almost completely destroyed during the Battle of Berlin, the ruins of the Old Reich Chancellery were not cleared until 1950.

==New Reich Chancellery==

In late January 1938, Adolf Hitler officially assigned his favourite architect, Albert Speer, to build the New Reich Chancellery around the corner on Voßstraße, a western branch-off of Wilhelmstraße, requesting that the building be completed within a year. Hitler commented that Bismarck&#x27;s Old Chancellery was &quot;fit for a soap company&quot; and not suitable as headquarters of a Greater German Reich. It nevertheless remained his official residence, where Hitler lived in the so-called &quot;Führerwohnung&quot; (&quot;Leader apartment&quot;). The Old and New Chancellery shared a large garden area, with the underground &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, where Hitler ultimately committed suicide at the end of April 1945.

Hitler placed the entire northern side of the Voßstraße at Speer&#x27;s disposal, assigning him the work of creating grand halls and salons which &quot;will make an impression on people&quot;. Speer was given a blank cheque—Hitler stated that the cost of the project was immaterial—and was instructed that the building be of solid construction, and that it be finished by the following January in time for the next New Year&#x27;s diplomatic reception to be held in the new building.

Speer claimed in his autobiography that he had completed the task of clearing the site, designing, constructing, and furnishing the building in less than a year. In fact, preliminary planning and versions of the designs were already being worked on as early as 1935. To clear the space for the New Reich Chancellery, the buildings on the northern side of Voßstraße No. 2–10 had been demolished in 1937.

Over 4,500 people worked in shifts, so that progress could be made around the clock. The immense construction was finished 48 hours ahead of schedule, and the project earned Speer a reputation as a good organiser, which played a part in the architect becoming Armaments Minister and a director of forced labour later in the war. Speer recalls that the whole work force—masons, carpenters, plumbers, etc. were invited to inspect the finished building. Hitler then addressed the workers in the Sportpalast; interior fittings, however, were not finished until the early 1940s. In the end, the project cost over 90 million Reichsmarks (equivalent to million €), and hosted the various ministries of the Reich.

In his memoirs, Speer described the impression of the &quot;Reichskanzlei&quot; on a visitor:

The series of rooms comprising the approach to Hitler&#x27;s reception gallery were decorated with a rich variety of materials and colours, and totalled in length. The gallery itself was long. Hitler&#x27;s own office was in size. From the outside, the chancellery had a stern, authoritarian appearance. From the Wilhelmplatz, guests would enter the Chancellery through the Court of Honour &quot;(Ehrenhof)&quot;. The building&#x27;s main entrance was flanked by two bronze statues by sculptor Arno Breker: &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Die Partei&quot; (&quot;Armed Forces&quot; and &quot;The Party&quot;). Hitler is said to have been greatly impressed by the building and was uncharacteristically free in his praise for Speer, lauding the architect as a &quot;genius&quot;. The chancellor&#x27;s great study was a particular favourite of the dictator. In it there stood a grand marble-topped table, which remained generally decorative up until 1944, when it served as an important part of the Nazi leader&#x27;s military headquarters; the study being used for military conferences. On the other hand, the Cabinet room was never used for its intended purpose.

The New Reich Chancellery suffered severe damage during the Battle of Berlin between April and May 1945 (in comparison, the Old Reich Chancellery was not as badly damaged). Andrei Gromyko, who would later become the Soviet foreign minister, visited the partially-destroyed structure a few weeks after the fighting in the city had completely ceased. He recalls, &quot;We reached it not without difficulties. Ruined edifices, formless heaps of metal and ferro-concrete encumbered the way. To the very entrance of the Chancellery, the car could not approach. We had to reach it on foot...&quot; He noted the New Reich Chancellery &quot;...was almost destroyed... Only the walls remained, riddled by countless shrapnel, yawning by big shot-holes from shells. Ceilings survived only partly. Windows loomed black by emptiness.&quot;

The last stage of defense by defending German troops took place inside the Reich Chancellery, as mentioned by Gromyko, who stated the following:

After World War II in Europe ended, the remains in what was then East Berlin (the Soviet-occupied sector of a divided Berlin) were demolished by the order of the Soviet occupation forces. Parts of the building&#x27;s marble walls were rumoured to have been used in the building of the Soviet war memorial located in Treptower Park, or to renovate and repair the nearby war-damaged Mohrenstraße U-Bahn station. Petrographic analyses of materials used for construction there did not confirm those rumours. Some of the so-called &quot;red marble&quot; (actually limestone) obtained from the demolition of the New Reich Chancellery was also supposedly used in the construction of the Moscow Metro&#x27;s palatial-style stations after the war. Also, it is alleged that a heater from one of Hitler&#x27;s rooms was placed in a Protestant hospital located not too far away from the Reich Chancellery.

While the western half of the plot was used by the East German government for the establishment of the so-called &quot;Death-Strip&quot; adjacent to the Berlin Wall in 1961 (when the barrier was being constructed), a &quot;Plattenbau&quot; apartment block, together with a kindergarten, was built on the eastern half (along Wilhelmstraße) during the 1980s.

<text>Alessandro &quot;Sandro&quot; Nannini (born 7 July 1959) is an Italian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nannini won the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix with Benetton.

Born in Siena, Nannini is the younger brother of musician Gianna Nannini. He began his career rallying in a Lancia Stratos before switching to open-wheel racing in 1981. The following year, he started competing for Minardi in European Formula Two, where he remained for three seasons. Nannini also made appearances in the World Sportscar Championship for Martini, winning the 1000km of Kyalami in 1984 and entering three editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. He was granted an FIA Super License in —having been controversially denied one the year prior—and made his Formula One debut at the with Minardi. After 26 retirements in 30 starts across two seasons at Minardi, Nannini joined Benetton to partner Thierry Boutsen. He retained his seat in after scoring podiums at the British and Spanish Grands Prix. Nannini took his only victory in Formula One at the , inheriting the win from Ayrton Senna following his infamous disqualification. Several podiums followed in as he was partnered by Nelson Piquet, including a second-placed finish at the .

In October 1990, Nannini severed his right forearm in a helicopter accident at his vineyard in Siena, ending his Formula One career with one win, two fastest laps and nine podiums. He returned to racing in 1993, competing in four seasons of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft—later known as the International Touring Car Championship—with Alfa Corse, finishing third in the 1996 standings. Nannini became a race-winner in the 1997 FIA GT Championship with Mercedes, before retiring at the end of the year.

==Biography==
Nannini was born in Siena on 7 July 1959. He began racing in a Lancia Stratos at national rally events before switching to Formula Italia in 1981. From 1982 to 1984, he raced for Minardi in Formula 2, attracting some attention for his speed in the uncompetitive car. Though his best season saw him only seventh overall in 1983, he was signed by Lancia to drive their fast but fragile LC2 prototype in the World Sportscar Championship, setting fastest lap at the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans where he finished eighth with Bob Wollek, and later that year winning the 1984 1000 km of Kyalami with Riccardo Patrese. For 1985, Giancarlo Minardi wanted Nannini to drive his new Formula One car, but Nannini was controversially denied an FIA Super Licence with his former F2 teammate Pierluigi Martini taking the drive instead. Nannini continued with Lancia instead, his best result being third in the 1000km Monza.

For 1986, Nannini was finally granted a Super Licence and signed up with Minardi&#x27;s Grand Prix team, where he stayed until 1987. The car was uncompetitive and unreliable (Nannini was classified only four times from 30 starts with the team), largely due to its disappointing Motori Moderni V6 engine. However, Nannini&#x27;s speed was noticed by many, especially after he largely outperformed experienced teammate Andrea de Cesaris in 1986. The following year, in his spare time, Nannini paired with veteran road race driver Giorgio Marin to win the 1987 Mille Miglia. 

Benetton signed Nannini for 1988 to drive alongside Thierry Boutsen. He generally performed very well, often out-pacing the highly regarded Belgian if not matching his consistency. He scored his first point in his second race for the team and took two third places on his way to tenth overall in the championship.

With Boutsen leaving for Williams Nannini was promoted to team leader at Benetton alongside young Englishman Johnny Herbert and delivered a number of strong performances, especially at Suzuka. There he lay third behind the two McLaren cars of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost when they collided, giving Nannini the lead. Prost retired whereas Senna rejoined after being push-started and pitted to replace his front wing, trailing Nannini in the race. Nannini was eventually passed by Senna who went on to cross the finish line first, however, the Brazilian was subsequently disqualified for missing the chicane following his collision with Prost. The disqualification handed Nannini what proved to be his only Formula One win. He rounded off the season with an impressive second place in torrential rain at Adelaide, moving him to sixth overall in the championship.

For 1990, he was joined in the team by Nelson Piquet and reverted to being the number two driver. However, he impressed by largely matching the pace of the three-times World Champion. At Hockenheim he led the race by deciding against stopping for tyres, resisting Senna for 16 laps before fading grip dropped him to second. He also challenged at the following Hungarian Grand Prix, hounding leader Boutsen until being controversially pushed off by the following Senna.

On 12 October 1990, the week after the , where he had finished third, Nannini was involved in a helicopter crash over his Siena vineyard, suffering a severed right forearm. The injury healed thanks to microsurgery but it ended his Formula One career. Nannini had been reconfirmed by Benetton for 1991 but Ferrari had a long-standing interest in the driver and were considering him as a replacement for the departing Nigel Mansell.

Once sufficiently recovered, Ferrari offered Nannini a test drive on its private Fiorano Circuit in 1992. Nannini completed a total of 38 laps driving Jean Alesi&#x27;s Ferrari F92A, which featured a specially modified steering wheel. In 1996, Benetton&#x27;s Flavio Briatore also honoured the promise of a test drive, which took place at Estoril aboard a B196.

Despite only regaining partial use of his right hand, Nannini was able to carve out a career in touring car racing with Alfa Romeo in the 1990s, placing fourth overall in the 1994 DTM championship and third in the 1996 International Touring Car Championship.

Nannini competed for Mercedes in the 1997 FIA GT Championship, finishing sixth overall and winning a race at Suzuka, before hanging up his helmet. He now runs a chain of upmarket cafes bearing his name, with branches as far flung as Indonesia.

2007 saw Nannini&#x27;s return to the track after a decade in retirement. He agreed to take part in the short-lived Grand Prix Masters championship for Formula One veterans, alongside drivers including his former Benetton teammate Johnny Herbert.

He is a member of the Italy–USA Foundation.

Matteo Nannini, a son of a first cousin of Alessandro, is also a racing driver, and has raced at the Formula 3 level as recently as 2021, as well as having competed in Indy NXT in 2023.

He currently serves as the team owner of Academy Motorsport in the NASCAR Euro Series, and acted as an owner-driver whilst it operated as Alex Caffi Motorsport.

==Early life==
Alessandro Giuseppe Caffi was born on 18 March 1964 in Rovato, Brescia, Northern Italy. He spent three years in Italian Formula Three from 1984 to 1986, finishing runner-up in 1984 and 1985, then third in 1986. 1986 also saw him land a one-off drive with the Osella Formula One team.

==Formula One career==
===1980s===
;1986
Caffi was handed his Formula One debut by Osella, at his, and the team&#x27;s home race, the Italian Grand Prix, in place of Canadian Allen Berg. Qualifying 27th and last in his FA1H (because of a quirk where for this race, and the following one in Portugal, 27 cars were allowed to start) Caffi drove sensibly and steadily to stay out of trouble and come home last of the runners, albeit six laps down and unclassified.

;1987
Osella were impressed by his sensible approach, and signed him for a full season in 1987. The Alfa Romeo-powered FA1I was uncompetitive and unreliable; Caffi finished no races out of 16 and failed to qualify twice, though he was classified once. At the opening round, the Brazilian Grand Prix, Caffi retired after 21 laps due to exhaustion as the heat and physically demanding nature of the car proved too much.

The San Marino Grand Prix, three weeks later, provided Caffi with his only classification of the year, 12th, despite running out of fuel five laps from the finish. Then came a run of 10 consecutive retirements; in Belgium, Monaco, where he qualified an excellent 16th and ran as high as 10th, the United States, where he qualified 19th, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Austria, Italy and Portugal.

As the season drew to a close, Caffi failed to qualify for two of the final four races in Spain and Australia, bookending retirements in Mexico, where he ran as high as 7th due to attrition, and Japan where he ran out of fuel. Despite finishing so few races, none were down to driver error, though Caffi was unclassified in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

;1988
1988 saw Caffi switch to the new Scuderia Italia team. Early season form was thin. Their challenger for the season, the Dallara built and Ford-Cosworth powered F188 was not ready for the first race in Brazil, so to fulfil the championship&#x27;s requirements of entering every race, a modified Formula 3000 car, the 3087, was used as a stop-gap. Not surprisingly, Caffi failed to pre-qualify.

The new car arrived in time for San Marino, but fortunes failed to improve as Caffi retired and an excellent 17th in qualifying at Monaco was ruined when he crashed all alone on the opening lap, the first blot on his career copybook. Caffi&#x27;s third retirement in a row in Mexico and failure to qualify in Canada only added to the nightmare.

Mid-season though saw a turnaround in both Caffi&#x27;s, and the team&#x27;s season, with four finishes on the spin; 8th in the United States, 12th in France after qualifying 14th, 11th in Great Britain and 15th in Germany after qualifying 19th.

Form during the following five races was patchy. Three top-10 finishes; 8th in Belgium after qualifying 15th, 7th in Portugal (his best career finish at the time) after qualifying 17th and 10th in Spain after qualifying 18th, were scattered around a couple of retirements; in Hungary where he qualified in the top-10 for the first time in 10th, and Italy.

1988 concluded with a brace of retirements in Japan, where he spun off, and after qualifying 11th in Australia. For the second season in a row Caffi was unclassified in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

;1989

Scuderia Italia expanded to a two-car outfit for the 1989 season, with fellow Italian Andrea de Cesaris in the second Pirelli shod F189. As with the previous year, Caffi failed to pre-qualify for the opening round in Brazil, but San Marino, next on the calendar, saw Caffi qualify 9th and finish just outside the points in 7th.

Momentum continued onto Monaco with another top-10 in qualifying, 9th, followed by the first Formula One points for himself and the team with an excellent drive to 4th. 13th in Mexico was followed by retirement in the United States, when Caffi, who qualified 6th and at one stage was running 2nd only to Alain Prost, was pushed into the wall rather comically whilst trying to lap teammate Andrea de Cesaris.

A second points finish of 6th in Canada was another highlight but Caffi&#x27;s season rarely peaked after that with just two finishes in the final 10 races; 7th in Hungary (after qualifying a stunning 3rd) and 9th in Japan.

Failure to finish in France, Germany, Belgium, after spinning off, Italy, Portugal where he qualified 7th then collided with three-time World Drivers&#x27; Champion Nelson Piquet, Spain and Australia, where he qualified 10th before spinning off, along with a failure to pre-qualify in Great Britain rounded off an inconsistent year. Four points and 19th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship were Caffi&#x27;s rewards.

===1990s===
;1990
Caffi, by now gaining a reputation as a promising talent, was tempted to Arrows for 1990 as Japan&#x27;s Footwork Corporation were investing in the team throughout the year (to the extent that Arrows was renamed Footwork from 1991 to 1996) and Porsche had agreed to supply engines to the squad. Caffi was signed to drive the second A11 alongside another Italian, 1985 World Drivers&#x27; Championship runner-up Michele Alboreto.

Injury caused by a pre-season cycling accident forced Caffi to sit out the opening race in the United States, with German Bernd Schneider filling the gap. Retirement in Brazil and failure to qualify in San Marino only compounded Caffi&#x27;s woes.

The following four races were patchy with a 5th, and two points, in Monaco followed by an 8th in Canada, failure to qualify in Mexico and retirement in France. Five consecutive top-10 finishes mid-season; in Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and Italy brought about a consistency to Caffi&#x27;s performance.

His, and everybody&#x27;s, Portuguese Grand Prix was ended early when he crashed into the Lola of Aguri Suzuki and the resulting foot injuries ruled Caffi out of the next race, Spain, with Schneider once again deputising.

Another positive performance of 9th in Japan was cancelled out by failure to qualify for the final round in Australia. Over the course of the season Caffi scored all the team&#x27;s points and outperformed the more experienced Alboreto to end 1990 with two points and 16th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

;1991
As Caffi&#x27;s career gradually rose in stock throughout the previous year, 1991 looked promising for the Italian. Unfortunately, the season turned out to be anything but. The Porsche 3512 V12 was cumbersome and underpowered, whilst both cars, the A11C and the FA12 were little better.

For the first time in his Formula One career, Caffi failed to qualify for any of the opening four races; in the United States, Brazil, San Marino, and Monaco.

The latter would be best remembered for a huge crash in practice, when Caffi slid off line and into the barriers at the Swimming Pool series of corners. The impact was so heavy, the car broke in three; the gearbox and rear wing broke free from the engine, which in turn came clear of the tub. Despite suffering no serious injuries as a result of the crash, Caffi was injured shortly after in a road accident.

As a result, Footwork drafted in Stefan Johansson for the races in Canada, Mexico, France and Great Britain and when Caffi returned to fitness, he discovered the team were trying to keep the Swede on. He managed to regain his seat via a legal injunction, but the struggles re-commenced with failure to qualify in Belgium compounded by pre-qualification failures in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

The season ended on a slightly higher note, as Caffi finished 10th in Japan and kept his head above water to finish 15th in the deluge in Australia. A season of catastrophe yielded no points and no classification in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

;1992
Footwork signed Aguri Suzuki to partner Michele Alboreto ahead of the 1992 season and Caffi was, rather abruptly, shown the door. With little time to find a drive, and most seats taken, he had no option but to sign for the new Andrea Moda team, alongside Italian Enrico Bertaggia. The team, owned by shoe-magnate and playboy Andrea Sassetti, had bought out the Coloni squad in 1991 and planned to use their C4 chassis with Judd V10 power for the new season.

However, registration problems with the FIA (involving Sassetti&#x27;s refusal to pay the $100,000 entrance fee for new teams) meant that Caffi managed no more than a few exploratory laps at the South African Grand Prix, the opening round of 1992. Before the next round in Mexico, the team&#x27;s new car, the Nick Wirth-designed S921, was built and prepared but freight delays forced Sassetti to withdraw both Caffi and Bertaggia from the Mexican event.

After two races Caffi had had enough, voiced his displeasure of the situation and was fired by Sassetti, with Brazilian super-sub Roberto Moreno taking his seat. No points from both races meant no classification in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, but more significantly, it signalled the end of the Italian&#x27;s Formula One career at the age of 28.

==Later life==
After F1 he raced on and off in sports and touring cars, mainly in the United States, where in 1998 he had an IRL test at Pikes Peak Raceway. After a brief career in Spanish and Italian Touring Cars, Caffi found his niche in sportscars, racing in GTs, FIA Sportscar, and ALMS. He returned to International motorsport in the IRC Rally Monte-Carlo 2011, driving a Skoda Fabia S2000. 25 years after his Formula 1 career Italian Alex Caffi won on the streets of the Principality during the Monaco Grand Prix Historique 2016. Caffi was one of the high-profile winners during the 10th running of the GP Historique when he guided the Kessel Racing Ensign N176 to victory in the Pre 1977 3-litre F1 race. 

In 2016, Caffi formed his own racing team Alex Caffi Motorsport. Alex Caffi Motorsport entered the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series on the same year as its formation, competing on a part-time basis for its debut season before stepping up to full-time competition in 2017. The team took part in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series under the Alex Caffi Motorsport guise for five seasons before it was rebranded to Academy Motorsport in 2021 after entrepreneur Federico Monti became the co-owner of the team. Academy continues to compete in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series to this day, currently fielding the #1 Ford Mustang and #5 EuroNASCAR FJ 2020 in both EuroNASCAR PRO and EuroNASCAR 2. 

When he is not racing he is an instructor at the official Subaru Italia safety driving and racing school.

<text>Alex Dias Ribeiro (born November 7, 1948) is a former racing driver from Brazil. He entered in 20 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix but scored no World Championship points.

==Career==

After solid graduation from the lower formulae (he placed fifth in the 1976 European Formula Two season), Ribeiro paid for his drive in the March Formula One team for the season (his main sponsors were Caixa Econômica Federal and Souza Cruz).

However, the season turned into a nightmare. March owner Max Mosley hired four drivers, and the team simply could not provide for them all. Ribeiro&#x27;s reputation as a driver suffered.

In 1978, he tried to save his credentials as a racing driver and set up a privately owned F2 team to enter the 1978 European Formula Two season, a year dominated by the March factory team. His car was painted with the words &quot;Jesus Saves&quot;, which he also painted his Formula One cars. Ribeiro managed to win the Nürburgring round dramatically after favorites Bruno Giacomelli and Marc Surer retired from the race. The rest of the season, however, bore no fruit.

Then, in 1979, the fellow Brazilian Fittipaldi team offered him two chances to qualify a second car, for the Canadian and American Formula One Grand Prix. However, the team was concentrating on former F1 champion Emerson Fittipaldi, and Ribeiro failed to qualify for both events.

He subsequently went on to perform chaplaincy at the F1 events he attended as the driver of the Medical Car and is arguably the most accomplished driver in the &#x27;Christians In Motorsport&#x27; group.

In 1994, he joined the Brazil national football team as a pastor at the FIFA World Cup in the United States. He held worship services for the team and later wrote a book about the team&#x27;s journey to victory, titled &quot;Who won the &#x27;94 World Cup?&quot; (¿quién Ganó La Copa Mundial?).

At the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, Ribeiro crashed her Medical Car at the Tabac curve before Saturday morning practice, and passenger doctor Sid Watkins broke three ribs. At the 2002 Brazilian Grand Prix, Ribeiro was involved in a potentially serious incident. During the morning warm-up on race day Sunday, Enrique Bernoldi crashed his Arrows in Turn 2. When Ribeiro, driving the Medical Car, went out to check on Bernoldi, he opened the door to the car. Just as he opened it, Nick Heidfeld came along in his Sauber and smashed into the open door. Both Ribeiro and Heidfeld were uninjured.

In 1981, Ribeiro wrote an autobiographical book called &quot;Mais Que Vencedor&quot; (rough translation &quot;More Than A Winner&quot;), in which he names March owner Max Mosley &quot;Mack Mouse&quot; and March engineer Robin Herd &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. He owned a motorbike shop in Brasilia where both Nelson Piquet and Roberto Moreno worked as young mechanics, therefore having the unusual distinction that the same shop produced 3 Formula One drivers.

<doc id="1218389" wikidata="Q78499" url="?curid=1218389" title="Alexander Wurz">
<text>Alexander Georg Wurz (; born 15 February 1974) is an Austrian former professional racing driver, driver training expert and businessman. He competed in Formula One from until , and is also a two-time winner of the Le Mans 24 Hours.

He is currently under contract to race for the Toyota factory racing team in the WEC (World Endurance Championship).
In Formula One, he is a commentator for TV and media, as well as being Williams F1 Team&#x27;s driver coach, chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association, and occasionally a driver steward.

==Career==

===Cycling===
Born in Waidhofen an der Thaya, Wurz competed in cycling events in his youth, and won the BMX World Championship in 1986 at the age of 12. In 2000, Wurz started a mountain bike team with his countryman Markus Rainer. The team, Rainer-Wurz.com, is sponsored by sponsors McLaren, Siemens, and Cannondale, and has won the World Cup several times. In the early 2000s, niche bicycle brand Katarga presented a limited edition high-end mountain bike called the Alexander Wurz EVO SL, whose frame prominently featured Wurz&#x27;s autograph.

===Auto racing===

====Early career====
Like most Formula One drivers, Wurz&#x27;s motorsport career began with karting. In 1991, Wurz drove in Formula Ford. In 1993, he switched to the German Formula Three Championship. During his time in Formula 3, Wurz crashed out of the lead at a race at AVUS in 1995 after a collision with the safety car. From 1996, Wurz drove an Opel Calibra for the Joest Racing touring car team in the DTM. Also in 1996, Wurz, together with Davy Jones and Manuel Reuter, won the Le Mans 24 Hours and in so doing became the youngest ever winner of the 24-hour race, a record he still holds.

====Formula One====

=====Benetton (1997–2000)=====
Wurz&#x27;s Formula One debut was on 15 June 1997 at Montreal for Benetton filling in for fellow Austrian Gerhard Berger, who could not race due to illness. Wurz achieved a podium position in his third race (1997 British Grand Prix) before returning to being a test driver upon Berger&#x27;s return to the cockpit at the German Grand Prix, which Berger won.

Wurz was given a full-time race seat for the 1998 season with Benetton and spent three more seasons at the team, partnered each year by Giancarlo Fisichella. In 1998, he outscored Fisichella by one point to finish joint 7th in the driver&#x27;s championship together with Heinz-Harald Frentzen. At the 1998 Monaco Grand Prix, he was running second ahead of Michael Schumacher for a brief period, but his hopes of a podium finish were ruined when Schumacher collided with him when tried to pass at Loews hairpin. The collision broke his suspension, causing him to spin off and crash at the Nouvelle Chicane exiting the tunnel.

The 1999 season was a disappointment for both drivers with the uncompetitive B199 (although Fisichella scored a podium in Canada). In the 2000 season, Wurz scored points only at the Italian Grand Prix, while Fisichella scored podium finishes three times. For 2001, Benetton&#x27;s last season before its transformation into Renault, he was replaced with Jenson Button.

=====Testing (2001–2006)=====

In , Wurz was a test driver for McLaren. In he was almost promoted as race driver for McLaren to replace Mika Häkkinen but he remained as test driver after Kimi Räikkönen took over.

In April 2005, with Juan Pablo Montoya injured, Wurz drove for McLaren in the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix, finishing fourth in the race, but taking third place after both BAR-Honda drivers were disqualified. This gave him the record for the longest interval between podium finishes at eight years.

Since signing to McLaren as test driver, Wurz had been eager to return to racing. At various times, rumours linked him to a return to a full race seat. In he was strongly linked to a race seat at Jaguar, where the under-fire Antônio Pizzonia was struggling. However, McLaren were struggling with their abortive new car and blocked the move to retain Wurz as a development driver. Jaguar then decided to give Pizzonia more time to prove himself, before drafting in Justin Wilson.

=====Williams (2007)=====

Wurz signed a deal with WilliamsF1 to become the team&#x27;s official test and reserve driver at the beginning of 2006. He drove the third car at all Friday sessions in . It was announced on 3 August 2006 that Wurz would replace Mark Webber as a race driver at Williams for the season. This was Wurz&#x27;s first full-time race drive since 2000, and his teammate was Nico Rosberg. At the Monaco GP on 27 May 2007, Wurz scored his first points for Williams, finishing in 7th place after qualifying 11th. He came third for the third time in his F1 career at the Canadian Grand Prix on 10 June 2007, having started 19th on the grid in an action packed race. He nearly repeated this at the European Grand Prix, but was unable to overtake Mark Webber at the final chicane. That race turned out to be Wurz&#x27;s last points finish. On 8 October 2007 he announced his immediate retirement from Formula One, meaning that the 2007 Chinese Grand Prix was his final race. He cited doubts over his own commitment as the main reason for his departure. He was replaced by Williams test driver Kazuki Nakajima for the final race of the 2007 season in Brazil.

=====Honda and Brawn GP (2008–2009)=====
Wurz was the Honda F1 test driver for the 2008 Formula One season, a role he kept when the team became Brawn GP in .

=====Williams (2012)=====
For the 2012 Formula One season, Wurz rejoined the Williams F1 Team, this time to guide the team&#x27;s inexperienced drivers Bruno Senna and Pastor Maldonado.

====Sportscars====
Wurz signed with Peugeot to be part of their driving squad for the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans and he also participated 1000km of Spa in the Le Mans Series.

In 2009, together with Marc Gené and David Brabham, he took outright victory in the Le Mans 24 Hours, driving a works Peugeot. The 13-year gap between Wurz&#x27;s victories is the largest in the event&#x27;s history. Together with his victory in 2010 of the 12hrs race of Sebring with Marc Gené and Anthony Davidson and his victory of the 1000 miles race of Road Atlanta with Stéphane Sarrazin and Franck Montagny in 2011 it made him win the 3 big Sportscar Classic Races in a Peugeot 908.
Wurz continued to race for Peugeot Sport Total through 2010 and 2011, though no further Le Mans wins were forthcoming. In November 2011, Toyota Motorsports confirmed Wurz as one of their factory drivers for the companies planned return to the 24 Heures du Mans in 2012. Wurz will drive their new LMP1 Hybrid Prototype alongside Nicolas Lapierre and Kazuki Nakajima.

====Rallycross====
In May 2018 Wurz announced that he would follow in the footsteps of his father by making his competitive rallycross debut at the FIA World Rallycross Championship&#x27;s World RX of Norway at Lånkebanen the following month, driving a Ford Fiesta Supercar for MJP Racing Team Austria.

==Road safety==
Wurz is involved in many projects regarding road safety and driver education and training. In 2006, he and his father founded the company &quot;Test and Training International&quot;, a leader in the field of road safety and driver training. He also works closely with the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile), since 2011 as an operating partner of the FIA Institute Young Driver Excellence Academy.

==Medical car driver==
In the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, Wurz drove the medical car after regular driver Jacques Tropenat fell ill.

==Team management==

===Team Superfund===
Wurz lodged an entry for his own team into Formula One (announced on 31 May 2009) but the application was unsuccessful. Team Superfund was one of several new applicants hoping to compete in the sport from the 2010 season onwards. It was believed that Wurz would prefer to align the team with an existing constructor based in the UK, perhaps renting space, facilities and staff from its factory, while Superfund takes time to build up its own headquarters, possibly based on existing resources in Austria. The team would have been funded by Christian Baha, the owner of the Superfund Group, and the cars would be powered by Cosworth engines.

==Personal life==
Wurz is the second son of former rallycross driver Franz Wurz, who won the European Rallycross Championship in 1974, 1976 and 1982.

Wurz resides in Monaco, is married to Julia Horden and has three sons: Charlie, Felix and Oscar. He used to race with different coloured boots on each foot, but since his return to racing in 2007, he wears matching pairs. On 10 November 2015 Wurz announced via his Twitter that after 20 years he would retire from racing. Wurz&#x27; son Charlie is currently competing in Formula 3 for Jenzer Motorsport and his son Oscar won the 2024 Formula 4 CEZ Championship.

<text> (, LU) or the Book of the Dun Cow (MS 23 E 25) is an Irish vellum manuscript dating to the 12th century. It is the oldest extant manuscript in Irish. It is held in the Royal Irish Academy and is badly damaged: only 67 leaves remain and many of the texts are incomplete. It is named after an anachronistic legend that it was made from the hide of a dun cow by Saint Ciarán of Clonmacnoise.

==History==
The manuscript is thought to be the work of three scribes, whose handwriting was distinguished by Richard Irvine Best in 1912 and identified with the letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;M&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. A and M are believed to be contemporary. A began the manuscript and wrote the opening pages of several of the texts, which were continued by M, who Best identified as Máel Muire mac Céilechair meic Cuinn na mBocht, based on matching the handwriting with two marginal &quot;probationes pennae&quot; or pen tests, in which the scribe wrote his name. A much later note elsewhere in the manuscript names Máel Muire as the person who &quot;wrote and compiled this book from divers[e] books&quot;. His murder by Vikings at Clonmacnoise is recorded in the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; in 1106, giving us a latest possible date and location for the main body of the manuscript. Some time later, &quot;H&quot; (named for his addition of two homilies) added a number of new texts and passages, sometimes over erased portions of the original, sometimes on new leaves. Based on orthography and an English loanword, Gearóid Mac Eoin concludes that H wrote in the late 12th or early 13th century.

After the monastery of Clonmacnoise was broken up, the manuscript came into the possession of the O&#x27;Donnell dynasty of Donegal who held it until 1359, when it and the lost &quot;Leabhar Gearr&quot; were used to ransom members of the clan who had been taken prisoner by Cathal Óg Ó Conchobhair Sligigh (d. 3 November 1362). Áed Ruad O&#x27;Donnell recovered the manuscript in 1470, and it remained in Donegal at least until 1631, when the compilation of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; was completed. Its location is unknown until 1837, when it was part of a collection owned by Messrs. Hodges &amp; Smith of College Green, Dublin, and was cited by George Petrie in an essay on the History and Antiquities of Tara Hill. The Hodges &amp; Smith collection, 227 manuscripts in all, was purchased by the Royal Irish Academy in 1844.

Joseph O&#x27;Longan&#x27;s lithographic facsimile of the manuscript was published by the RIA in 1870. A diplomatic edition by R. I. Best and Osborn Bergin , with the three hands distinguished by different typefaces, was published in 1929. Digital scans of the pages at the Royal Irish Academy have been published on the web by ISOS (Irish Script on Screen).

<text>Mahāsthāmaprāpta is a bodhisattva mahāsattva who represents the power of wisdom. His name literally means &quot;arrival of the great strength&quot;.

Mahāsthāmaprāpta is one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism, along with Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, Avalokiteśvara, Ākāśagarbha, Kṣitigarbha, Maitreya and Sarvanivarana-Vishkambhin.

In Chinese Buddhism, Mahasthamaprapta is sometimes portrayed as a woman, Dashizhi, with a likeness similar to Avalokiteśvara (known as Guanyin in China). He is also one of the Thirteen Buddhas in the Japanese school of Shingon Buddhism. In Tibetan Buddhism, Mahāsthāmaprāpta is equated with Vajrapani, who is one of his incarnations and was known as the Protector of Gautama Buddha.

Mahāsthāmaprāpta is one of the oldest bodhisattvas and is regarded as powerful, especially in the Pure Land school, where he takes an important role in the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;. He is often depicted in a trinity with Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin), especially in Pure Land Buddhism.

In the &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot;, Mahāsthāmaprāpta tells of how he gained enlightenment through the practice of nianfo, or continuous pure mindfulness of Amitābha, to obtain samādhi. In the &quot;Amitayurdhyana Sutra&quot;, Mahāsthāmaprāpta is symbolized by the moon while Avalokiteśvara is represented by the sun.

In the Introductory chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, Mahāsthāmaprāpta is present among the 80,000 bodhisattva mahāsattvas who assemble on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa to hear the Buddha&#x27;s preaching of the Wonderful Dharma of the Lotus Flower Sutra. The Buddha also addresses Mahāsthāmaprāpta in chapter 20 of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; to tell of the Buddha&#x27;s past life as the Bodhisattva Sadāparibhūta (&quot;Never Despising&quot;), a monk who was abused and reviled by arrogant monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen when he paid them respect by saying they would all become Buddhas. The Buddha explains to Mahāsthāmaprāpta how these arrogant people were punished, but are now bodhisattvas present in the assembly on the path to Enlightenment. The Buddha then praises the great strength of the Lotus Sutra thus: “O Mahāsthāmaprāpta, know that this Lotus Sutra will greatly benefit the bodhisattva mahāsattvas and lead them to highest, complete enlightenment. For this reason, after the Tathāgata’s parinirvāṇa the bodhisattva mahāsattvas should always preserve, recite, explain, and copy this sutra.”

==China==
Shi Yinguang (), a teacher of Pure Land Buddhism, was widely considered to be a manifestation of Mahāsthāmaprāpta based on the accounts of two people: 
1. Huìchāo (), a former Christian who had never heard of him before
2. Běnkōng (), a Buddhist monk and former student
Both of these figures had independent dreams regarding the situation.

==Japan==
In Japan, Mahāsthāmaprāpta is associated with the temple guardians Kongō Rikishi.

He is recognized as one of the Thirteen Buddhas.

<text>Playlife (stylised in reverse mirrored words) was a fashion company based in Treviso, Italy. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Benetton Group.

==History==
In July 1997, Benetton Group acquired a 57% stake in Benetton Sportsystem from Edizione Holdings for 318bn lire. At this time, it was rebranded to Playlife to represent sports equipment, goods and fashion for the company with brands such as Prince, Rollerblade and Kästle. In mid 1998, Benetton predicted around 40 Playlife specific stores would open in Europe. By 1999, the entire former Benetton Sportsystem brand was consolidated into the group under Playlife.

Playlife produced the tracksuits and casual shoes used by the Italian Olympic Team at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The team also opened the first dedicated Playlife store in Milan.

Store expansion continued and by 2011, Giovanni Peracin was announced as the new Playlife Business Director. At the same time, Benetton opened a new Playlife concept store in the headquarters city of Treviso, Italy.

However by late 2013, Playlife was axed by the Benetton Group during a restructuring.

==Formula One==
Between 1998 and 2000, the Benetton Formula One team utilised first Mecachrome and then Supertec engines that were rebranded to Playlife, and the cars featured sponsorship from the company.

<text>Andrea Lodovico de Adamich (born 3 October 1941) is a former racing driver from Italy. He participated in 34 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, making his debut on 1 January 1968. He scored a total of six championship points. He also participated in numerous non-championship Formula One races.

==Career==

De Adamich was born in Trieste, from a family originally from Croatia. One of his ancestors, Andrija Ljudevit Adamić, had been the wealthiest and most powerful merchant in Rijeka in the 18th century. Andrea de Adamich was an accomplished saloon and sport-car racer who performed solidly when asked to race in Formula One where he was one of the few drivers to have worn glasses to race.

He won the 1966 European Touring Car Championship at the start of a long relationship with Alfa Romeo and made his GP debut in the 1968 South African race when his Ferrari spun off on oil. Later in the season he won the South American Temporada F2 Championship in Argentina with Ferrari but was not retained by the Italian team and he returned to the Alfa Romeo fold as they entered F1 supplying engines to a third works McLaren. De Adamich only finished once in 1970 in the McLaren-Alfa and the following year was no more successful when the Alfa engine deal switched to March.

In 1972 De Adamich joined the Surtees team and scored his first Formula One points when he finished fourth in the Spanish GP at Jarama. In 1973 he moved to Brabham. After a promising start of the season, when he finished again fourth in the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, De Adamich career was ended abruptly due to injuries sustained in a multiple-car pile-up at the British Grand Prix. The accident happened when Jody Scheckter, running fourth in his McLaren, spun across the track at Woodcote Corner at the end of the first lap, causing many other cars to collide and crash. The incident eliminated nine cars, including all three works Surtees cars.

De Adamich retired the following year and became a respected motor sport journalist and TV pundit in his native Italy. From 1978 through 2012 he hosted the TV sport program &quot;Grand Prix&quot; on Italia 1.

He is currently the vice-president of N.Technology which prepares race cars for Alfa Romeo.

<doc id="1218397" wikidata="Q1324397" url="?curid=1218397" title="El Morro National Monument">
<text>El Morro National Monument is a U.S. national monument in Cibola County, New Mexico, United States. Located on an ancient east–west trail in the western part of the state, the monument preserves the remains of a large prehistoric pueblo atop a great sandstone promontory with a pool of water at its base, which subsequently became a landmark where over the centuries explorers and travelers have left personal inscriptions that survive today.

Between about 1275 to 1350 AD, up to 600 people of the Ancestral Puebloan culture lived in the 355+-room mesa-top pueblo. The village was situated on the old Zuni-Acoma Trail, an important ancient trade route. Spanish explorers visiting the area in the 16th century referred to the notable promontory as &quot;El Morro&quot; (&quot;The Headland&quot;); the local Zuni people call it &quot;A&#x27;ts&#x27;ina&quot; (&quot;Place of writings on the rock&quot;), and early Anglo-Americans referred to it as Inscription Rock.

With its oasis-like source of water, El Morro served as a natural resting place for numerous travelers through the otherwise arid and desolate region, many of whom left their signatures, names, dates, poems, and stories of their treks in the walls of the sandstone cliff. While some of the inscriptions are now faded through age, there are still many that can be seen today and remain legible, with some dating back to the 17th century. The oldest legible inscription at El Morro, left by Juan de Oñate, the first Spanish governor of the colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, is dated April 16, 1605. Among the Anglo-American emigrants who left their names there in 1858 were several members of the Rose-Baley Party, including Leonard Rose and John Udell. Nearby petroglyphs and carvings made by the Ancestral Puebloans were inscribed centuries before Europeans arrived. In 1906, U.S. federal law prohibited further carving on the cliffs.

El Morro was designated a national monument by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 8, 1906, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Today the site is managed by the National Park Service. The many inscription panels, water pool, pueblo ruins, and the top of the promontory are all accessible via park trails. El Morro is one of many prehistoric sites on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, a designated New Mexico Scenic Byway. The monument was featured in the film &quot;Four Faces West&quot; (1948), starring Joel McCrea. In December 2019, the International Dark Sky Association certified El Morro as an International Dark Sky Park, recognizing its preservation of not only the historic inscriptions but also its natural night sky.

<text>Lang Lang (; born 14 June 1982) is a Chinese pianist who has performed with major orchestras around the world and appeared at many leading concert halls. Active since the 1990s, he was the first Chinese pianist to be engaged by the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic and many of the top American orchestras. In 2000, a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; music critic called him &quot;the biggest, most exciting young keyboard talent I have encountered in many a year of attending piano recitals.&quot;

He was also a judge on the first two series of the British music competition television series &quot;The Piano&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

Lang Lang was born in Shenyang, China, in 1982 to a family of the Manchu Niohuru clan. His father Lang Guoren is a musician, playing the erhu. Both his father and mother, also a musician, were displaced to work on rice farms in the country during the Cultural Revolution, before Lang was born.

The &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; episode &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot;, which features Franz Liszt&#x27;s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2., motivated two-year-old Lang to learn the piano. He started lessons with Zhu Yafen at age three, won first place at the Shenyang Piano Competition and performed his first public recital when he was five.

When Lang was nine, he was expelled from his piano tutor&#x27;s studio for &quot;lack of talent&quot;. Lang has stated that upon learning of this, his father flew into a rage and told Lang that he &quot;shouldn&#x27;t live any more&quot;, ordering him to jump off the balcony of their 11th floor family apartment. Another music teacher at his state school noticed Lang and asked him to play the second movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 10, which reminded Lang of his love for the instrument. Lang later studied under Zhao Ping-Guo at Beijing&#x27;s Central Conservatory of Music.

Lang won the Xinghai National Piano Competition in Beijing in 1993 and first prize for outstanding artistic performance at the International Competition for Young Pianists in Ettlingen, Germany, in 1994. In 1995, Lang played the Chopin études at the Beijing Concert Hall, won the International Tchaikovsky Competition for Young Musicians in Japan, and performed as soloist with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. Fourteen-year-old Lang was a featured soloist for the China National Symphony&#x27;s inaugural concert in September 1996, then Chinese president Jiang Zemin met Lang after this performance.

Lang and his father moved to the United States in 1997, so Lang could pursue studies with Gary Graffman at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

== Career ==

Lang has been noted by musicians and critics around the world—the conductor Jahja Ling remarked: &quot;Lang Lang is special because of his total mastery of the piano... He has the flair and great communicative power.&quot; National Public Radio&#x27;s Morning Edition remarked: &quot;Lang Lang has conquered the classical world with dazzling technique and charisma.&quot; It is often noted that Lang successfully straddles two worlds—classical prodigy and rock-like &quot;superstar&quot;, a phenomenon summed up by &quot;The Times&quot; (London) journalist Emma Pomfret, who wrote, &quot;I can think of no other classical artist who has achieved Lang Lang&#x27;s broad appeal without dumbing down.&quot;

Lang&#x27;s performance style was controversial when he stormed into the classical music scene in 1999. At that time, pianist Earl Wild called him &quot;the J. Lo of the piano.&quot; Others have described him as immature, but admitted that his ability to &quot;conquer crowds with youthful bravado&quot; is phenomenal among classical musicians. His maturity in subsequent years was reported by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;The ebullient Lang Lang is maturing as an artist.&quot; In April 2009, when &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Lang in its list of the 100 most influential people, Herbie Hancock described his playing as &quot;so sensitive and so deeply human&quot;, commenting: &quot;You hear him play, and he never ceases to touch your heart.&quot;

In 2001, after a Carnegie Hall debut with Yuri Temirkanov, he traveled to Beijing with the Philadelphia Orchestra on a tour celebrating its 100th anniversary, during which he performed to an audience of 8,000 at the Great Hall of the People. The same year, he made his BBC Proms debut, prompting a music critic of the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; to write, &quot;Lang Lang took a sold-out Royal Albert Hall by storm... This could well be history in the making&quot;. In 2003, he returned to the BBC Proms for the First Night concert with Leonard Slatkin. After his recital debut with the Berlin Philharmonic, the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; wrote: &quot;Lang Lang is a superb musical performer whose artistic touch is always in service of the music&quot;. In 2004, Lang was featured in Radio Television Hong Kong&#x27;s TV documentary Outstanding Young Chinese Musicians.However, recent reviews have been mixed. Lately, a plethora of music critics have protested against too much showmanship; not enough care; not enough sensitivity. But audiences continue to adore him. Lang has become one of those artists whose career prospers outside the boundaries of critical approval. The pianist is bemused by the backlash: &quot;You get many good reviews from the beginning&quot;, he says, &quot;and then the critics start criticising you. It&#x27;s strange. The things they liked you for first—unique, fresh—they say is great. And then later they say you&#x27;re too fresh, too unique. But they&#x27;re the same thing!&quot;

Lang was the featured soloist on the Golden Globe-winning score of &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; and can be heard on the soundtrack of &quot;The Banquet&quot;. He has recorded for the Deutsche Grammophon and Telarc labels. His album of the first and fourth Beethoven piano concertos with the Orchestre de Paris and Christoph Eschenbach debuted at No. 1 on the Traditional Classical Billboard Chart. In 2008, he was the pianist on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;. In 2010, he signed with Sony for a reported $3 million. Metallica performed the song One alongside Lang at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014.

In December 2008, Lang partnered with Google and YouTube in the project YouTube Symphony Orchestra.

Lang has also recorded piano works for the video game &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;″s soundtrack, mostly under the &quot;Classical&quot; subgenre. This included versions of Danny Boy, &quot;Scott Joplin&#x27;s The Entertainer&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s 8th Piano Sonata, and one of the game&#x27;s intro pieces, the third movement from Prokofiev&#x27;s 7th Piano Sonata.

Lang has played for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, President Barack Obama, Queen Elizabeth II, President Hu Jintao, President Horst Köhler, Prince Charles (now Charles III), then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Polish President Lech Kaczyński.

He cancelled performances from March to July 2017, after injuring his left arm.

In 2023, Lang Lang became a judge on the Channel 4 television series &quot;The Piano&quot;, alongside singer Mika. He returned for the follow series in 2024, as well as a Christmas special, but departed afterwards to be replaced by American musician Jon Batiste.

=== White House state dinner ===

At the White House state dinner in honour of President of China Hu Jintao on 19 January 2011, one of the tunes Lang played was the song &quot;My Motherland&quot; from the movie &quot;Battle on Shangganling Mountain&quot;, a film about a Chinese victory in the Korean War. The song&#x27;s lyrics include the line &quot;We deal with wolves with guns&quot;, which in the film referred indirectly to the United States Army. Although the tune is popular and has lost much of its political and historical significance in China, the performance was interpreted by American conservatives as insulting the US.

In response to the controversy, Lang denied that he intended to insult the United States. He later released a statement stating that he &quot;selected this song because it has been a favorite of mine since I was a child. It was selected for no other reason but for the beauty of its melody.&quot; White House spokesperson Tommy Vietor also responded by saying &quot;My Motherland&quot; is &quot;widely known and popular in China for its melody. Lang played the song without lyrics or reference to any political theme... any suggestion that this was an insult to the United States is just flat wrong.&quot;

== Select appearances ==

Lang has performed at various open-air venues, including Central Park New York, Hollywood Bowl Los Angeles, the Ravinia Festival Chicago, Theaterplatz in Dresden, and Derby Park Hamburg.

In July 2007, he played at a concert from the Teatro del Silenzio, Lajatico, Italy, hosted by Andrea Bocelli. He performed &quot;Io ci sarò&quot; with Bocelli, and Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot;. The performance is available on a DVD entitled &quot;Vivere Live in Tuscany&quot;.

During these games, he was also featured on the German TV network ZDF and made several appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; Summer Olympics broadcasts.

<text>Denis Wick (1 June 1931 – 12 February 2025) was a British orchestral trombonist. He was also an internationally respected brass teacher and designer of brass mutes and mouthpieces. On retirement in 1989 he was awarded the International Trombone Association&#x27;s annual award; he served as their president 2004–2006.

==Life and career==
Wick was born in Braintree, Essex on 1 June 1931. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, and Luton Grammar School. He taught himself the trombone from the age of 10 when he received an instrument from the Chelmsford Salvation Army band. He played with the band until the age of 15 and soon joined Luton Brass Band which was enjoying considerable national success at the time. At the age of 16 he heard his first orchestral concert, and Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s trumpet playing so inspired him that he decided to pursue a career in playing.

Because his family was not well off, his mother worked to fund his studies. He spent a year at the Royal Academy of Music from 1950, but claimed he was frustrated with not learning anything there. Sid Langston was the professor, but he all but refused to pass on any of his experience in case his students &#x27;stole&#x27; his work.

Wick did an amateur date in Salisbury and by chance the other trombonists were from the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, so when the 2nd trombone job came up in July 1950, they called to invite him to audition, having already heard many of the final year students at the London music colleges. Wick won this audition and entered this large full-time professional orchestra at the age of 19. He went on to win an audition with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1952, a year after conductor Rudolf Schwarz had moved there. The audition had to be rigorous to persuade the administrators that Schwarz was not practising favouritism towards an ex-colleague from the BSO.

In Birmingham in 1955 Wick worked with Gordon Jacob in premiering his trombone concerto. This piece shows off the advances in technique that he was making: the cadenza in the last movement makes great use of warm-up and flexibility studies that Wick had developed and would prove hugely influential in the teaching of brass players in Britain to this day.

He held the position of principal trombone at the London Symphony Orchestra from 1957–1988, including when it recorded John Williams&#x27; arrangement of the opening title for &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The brass playing in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films has encouraged a whole generation of brass players, Wick making a blistering sound in partnership with Maurice Murphy, on 1st trumpet. Another recording where Wick made his mark is in the large solo in the 1970 LSO/Horenstein (Unicorn) recording of Mahler&#x27;s Third Symphony.

Soon after moving to the LSO, Wick moved the LSO section from .485&quot; bore Boosey Imperial tenor trombones and a .523&quot; G bass trombone to the American &quot;large bore&quot; instruments (.547&quot; tenor and slightly larger bass, now in B♭). Experimentation possibly started in Birmingham, and the Jacob Concerto suits the larger sound, but post-war import restrictions made these instruments impossible to obtain legally before 1958. Certainly he was a pioneer in Britain, and soon all the other orchestral players followed suit.

Wick taught initially at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1967–1989) and from 2000 had served on the faculty at the Royal Academy of Music, London. He was conductor of the Second Essex Youth Orchestra from 1977-1990s. He had also worked with the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra since 1993. He created his own line of mouthpieces and mutes for brass instruments, made by Denis Wick Products Ltd, and owned by Denis Wick Publishing.

He was honoured by the International Trombone Association several times. In 1989 he was awarded the ITA Award, presented each year to an individual who has greatly influenced the field of trombone. In 2006 he was presented with the Neill Humfeld Award, which recognises outstanding trombone teaching. During his presidency of the ITA 2004–2006 he brought the International Trombone Festival to Birmingham, and made great strides to internationalise the ITA magazine.

Wick died on 12 February 2025, at the age of 93.

<text>William Francis Burman (30 August 1897 – 23 October 1974) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Burman was 20 years old, and a sergeant in the 16th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge on 20 September 1917 south-east of Ypres, Belgium, when the advance of his company was held up by a machine-gun at point-blank range, Sergeant Burman shouted to the men next to him to wait a few minutes and going forward to what seemed certain death killed the enemy gunner and carried the gun to the company&#x27;s objective where he used it with great effect. Fifteen minutes later it was seen that about 40 of the enemy were enfilading the battalion on the right. Sergeant Burman and two others ran and got behind them, killing six and capturing two officers and 29 other ranks.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum in London, England.

<doc id="1218441" wikidata="Q6473773" url="?curid=1218441" title="Laidlaw">
<text>Laidlaw (), organized as Laidlaw International, Inc. (with corporate headquarters in Naperville, Illinois) was the largest provider of intercity bus services, contract public transit and paratransit, and contract school bus service in both the United States and Canada. In February 2007, FirstGroup, a bus and rail transportation operator in the United Kingdom with subsidiaries in North America, acquired Laidlaw International, Inc. FirstGroup completed the acquisition of Laidlaw International on October 1, 2007, and rebranded Laidlaw services under the First umbrella. The deal combined North America&#x27;s two largest private school bus operators—Education Services and First Student Inc.—giving them a combined 40% of the school bus contractor market.

Laidlaw had grown primarily through acquisitions of other companies and contracting of services formerly directly provided by government entities. It was the parent company of Laidlaw Transit (which was merged into First Transit), Laidlaw Education Services (merged into First Student), Greyhound Lines and Greyhound Lines of Canada, and a number of Gray Line Sightseeing franchises in major North American cities. In acquiring Laidlaw, FirstGroup announced that it would not retain the Laidlaw name, but that it would maintain the Greyhound brand.

== History ==
Laidlaw began in 1924 when founder Robert Laidlaw created Laidlaw Transit, a trucking service company in Hagersville, Ontario.

Beginning in 1972, under the leadership of Michael DeGroote, Laidlaw, Inc. began growing through acquisitions of other companies when it acquired a Canadian intercity and charter bus company. In 1979, it acquired a Canadian contract school bus business. In 1978 it entered the U.S. solid waste industry. In 1983, Laidlaw entered the U.S. school bus transportation sector with its acquisition of ARA Transportation, a major contract school bus provider which also owned a Wayne Corporation bus dealership. In 1984, Laidlaw Inc. exited the trucking business, as the company began a consolidating smaller school bus contracting companies in the U.S. and Canada. In 1988, Laidlaw, Inc. purchased a controlling interest in itself from Canadian Pacific Limited, parent of Canadian Pacific Railway.

Instances of reverse privatization were rare, but did occur during Laidlaw&#x27;s years of expansion. In Virginia, several school districts canceled their school bus contracts with private operators and brought bus operations in-house. By the late 1980s, the only 3 remaining district school bus contracts were at Petersburg, Norfolk and Hopewell. Self-operation conversions for all three were urged by Virginia Department of Education officials as &quot;cost-saving.&quot; The contracting companies unsuccessfully disputed the state&#x27;s financial calculations and cost allocations for the reverse privatizations, which effectively ended all public school bus contracting in Virginia by 1996. In 1991, after losing its major school bus contract in Norfolk, Virginia to a governmental conversion to district-self-operation, Laidlaw sold the rest of its urban-suburban bus line, school bus contracting business serving independent schools and day camps, and related assets in the Norfolk area to Virginia Overland Transportation. Virginia Overland Transportation was an operator of public service transportation and a much smaller industry consolidator in the state. The company had also lost their contract in Petersburg to self-operation in 1989, but was still operating at Hopewell. The latter converted in 1996, and Virginia Overland&#x27;s parent company based in Richmond closed in 2004. The former Virginia Overland subsidiary operation in the Norfolk area acquired from Laidlaw operates as Transquest and is now owned by Serco. As of 2007, Transquest was continuing bus contract operations transporting students to many independent schools in South Hampton Roads, including Norfolk Academy. 
In the 1990s, Laidlaw continued to acquire hundreds of smaller school bus and public transit contractors in the U.S. and Canada. These also included major competitors, including Mayflower Contract Services in 1995, and National Bus Service in 1996. In 1993, Laidlaw acquired San Diego–based MedTrans, a high quality industry leader which began as Harrison Ambulance in San Diego, operating emergency medical services operating in California, Washington, Nevada and Texas, and continued to grow it through 138 acquisitions across the country, reaching over $1 billion in revenue. Glen Roberts was the MedTrans CEO and Donald Jones, COO, at the time of the Laidlaw acquisition. In 1998, the company acquired American Medical Response, another nationwide U.S. ambulance service provider and CareLine, Inc., U.S. ambulance consolidator of smaller ambulance contractors. In 1996, Laidlaw sold its solid waste business to Allied Waste Industries. Allied Waste sold the Canadian operations to USA Waste Services, Inc. Laidlaw American branches were re-branded to many different names, depending on their location.

In 1998, a watershed year, Laidlaw Inc. acquired Greyhound Lines U.S. operations, Greyhound Canada, the DAVE Companies (specialists in paratransit) and emergency management companies EmCare and Spectrum Emergency Care.

After incurring heavy losses through its investments in Safety-Kleen and Greyhound Lines and after almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001. Laidlaw International, Inc. listed its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (Ticker: LI), on February 10, 2004, and emerged from reorganization on June 23, 2003, as the successor to Laidlaw Inc. Canadian Pacific sold its remaining 17% interest in Laidlaw Inc. The company later sold American Medical Response and EmCare, its EMS contract operations, to new owners.

===Laidlaw Waste Systems===
In 1969 DeGroote began to expand beyond trucking by acquiring a solid waste management company. In the 1970s he would increasingly focus on waste management and other areas, shifting away from the boom-or-bust trucking industry, which had a tendency to rise and fall with the economy. Garbage, on the other hand, always had to be dealt with. In 1978, Laidlaw entered the United States solid waste industry, Laidlaw Waste Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Laidlaw Inc, In 1986 Laidlaw acquired Genstar Corp (GSX) of Boston and in 1996 then sold its solid waste business to Allied Waste Industries and many former Laidlaw operations where then rebranded to local names depending on the locations. Laidlaw sold the Canadian operations to USA Waste Services, Inc. Laidlaw American branch&#x27;s where re-branded to many different names, depending on the location of were they were. After incurring heavy losses through its investments in Safety-Kleen and Greyhound Lines. After almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001.

<doc id="1218448" wikidata="Q12061547" url="?curid=1218448" title="McKeen Motor Car Company">
<text>The McKeen Motor Car Company of Omaha, Nebraska, was a builder of internal combustion-engined railroad motor cars (railcars), constructing 152 between 1905 and 1917.
Founded by William McKeen, the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Superintendent of Motive Power and Machinery, the company was essentially an offshoot of the Union Pacific and the first cars were constructed by the UP before McKeen leased shop space in the UP&#x27;s Omaha Shops in Omaha, Nebraska. The UP had asked him to develop a way of running small passenger trains more economically and McKeen produced a design that was ahead of its time. Unfortunately, internal combustion engine technology was not and the McKeen cars never found a truly reliable powerplant.

The vast majority of the cars produced were for E. H. Harriman&#x27;s empire of lines (Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and others). Harriman&#x27;s death in 1909 lost the company its major sponsor and investor and Harriman&#x27;s successors were less enthusiastic about the McKeen cars.

Many McKeen cars ended up being re-engined with a variety of drive mechanisms — gasoline-mechanical, gasoline-electric, diesel-electric or even steam power.

Most, although not all, McKeen cars had the distinctive &quot;wind-splitter&quot; pointed aerodynamic front end and rounded tail. The porthole windows were also a McKeen trademark, adopted allegedly for strength after the 7th production car. A dropped central door, as pictured, was also present on the majority of the cars. Two lengths, 55 and 70 feet, were offered; either could be fitted out with a large mail and express area ahead of the center doors, a smaller mail/express area, or the car could be all seats for a maximum capacity of 64 or 105 respectively.

==History==
==Anatomy of a McKeen car==

===Carbody===

===Engine===
Originally, McKeen cars used engines from the Standard Motor Works of Jersey City, New Jersey, but switched to an engine of their own design from the eighth car produced, &quot;M8&quot; on the Union Pacific. All engines were straight-6 in configuration, of power ratings between on the first car (&quot;M1&quot;) and a maximum of on the most powerful later cars. The cylinders were vertical and the engine mounted transversely across the car in all McKeen cars and locomotives produced. The majority of McKeen motors were distillate fueled. 

All engines were equipped to be run in either direction, as is not uncommon with marine engines; there was no reverse gear. To run in reverse, the engine had to be stopped, the camshaft shifted by the motorman to the reverse cam set and the engine restarted in reverse. A flywheel located on the left side of the lead truck spun in the direction the engine was operating, whether or not the car was in motion. The flywheel aided in the engine momentum and operated the electric generator for lighting.

Starting was by compressed air.


===Motor truck===

The lead truck of the car was the powered truck; the engine was rigidly mounted atop this truck and moved with it when it turned. Only the front axle was powered (via a chain drive) a design decision which contributed to the car&#x27;s poor adhesion characteristics. The front wheelset had a 42-inch diameter, while the three other wheelsets were 33-inch diameter.

===Interior===

McKeen cars were generally wood-panelled on the interior and fitted with transverse bench seats with a central aisle. The rounded rear was fitted with a semi-circular bench seat. Lighting was originally acetylene.

==Problems with McKeen cars==

Most of the problems experienced with McKeen cars involved the powerplant and drivetrain. As with many other attempts to bring marine engine technology to the rails, engines that were reliable on the stable platform of a ship when attended to by experienced technicians and operators proved less so when exposed to the vibration, indifferent maintenance and less careful handling they found on the railroad.

Starting the engine was a problem on the early cars; with no independently powered compressor, the compressed-air starting relied on the limited reserves of the car&#x27;s reservoirs. There were many reports of cars being started by being pushed or towed by locomotives or even horses, after the compressed air ran out. Later cars, with an independent gasoline-driven compressor which could be hand-started, did not suffer from these problems.

The lack of a reverse gear also caused problems. The engine had to be stopped, the camshaft shifted to a set of reverse cams and then started in the opposite direction. This was acceptable shipboard, perhaps, but deeply disliked by railroad operators. Accounts exist of engineers&#x27; elaborate schemes for avoiding the necessity to reverse.

The transmission was a common problem; a clutch did not seem to exist which combined the ability to withstand on a regular basis with the ability to give a smooth start. Clutch failures were commonplace. Competitor GE&#x27;s cars used an electric transmission and that or a hydraulic torque converter have been used on the vast majority of successful internal combustion-engined rail vehicles since.

Many operators found the McKeen car to be lacking in power and traction, the latter unsurprising since only one of four axles was powered.

==Unusual McKeen products==
The vast majority of McKeen products followed the pattern set out above, but some unusual ones were also rolled out.

===Victorian Railways cars===

The Victorian Railways, the government-run system of the state of Victoria in Australia, ordered two McKeen cars in 1911, these being delivered in 1912. These were the only broad-gauge cars, built to the VR gauge of . They were fitted with buffers and hook and chain couplers, and were built with the rounded-nose body type, rather than knife-nosed. Since VR stations uniformly had car-level platforms, the usual dropped entranceway was instead raised into the roof.

===Queensland Railways cars===
In 1911, the Queensland Railways of the state of Queensland, Australia, ordered five McKeen cars which were delivered in May 1913. These were to the QR gauge of , and were the only narrow gauge McKeen cars. They were issued running numbers 1 through 5.

Like the Victorian Railways cars, the cars were fitted with the more rounded nose and with buffers; however, the typical McKeen dropped center door was retained to permit easy passenger access without a raised platform. The cars, unlike most, had the same size of wheels on both axles of the lead truck and a chain drive linking them, making all 4 wheels driven.

These cars were approximately long and originally seated 75; this was soon reduced to 69 by dividing the car into a non-smoking section (seating 55) and a smoking section (seating 14). The five cars were based at Woolloongabba for most of their lives, and handled services to the Brisbane suburbs of Corinda and Sunnybank as well as between Manly and Cleveland.

The cars proved no more reliable in Queensland than elsewhere; by 1920 car No.1 was out of service and cars Nos. 2 and 5 were modified as Tourist and Day Inspection cars, with luxury accommodations for 32 passengers. They were still expensive to run, at an estimated double the running costs of a steam-hauled train; the Great Depression finished them off, and the five cars were withdrawn between 1929 and 1931 and scrapped at QR&#x27;s Ipswich shops.

===Southern Utah Railroad #100===
The Southern Utah Railroad took possession in 1916 of the most powerful McKeen motor car ever produced, with a six-wheel leading truck.
Two of the three axles in that truck were powered, connected by side rods; the engine developed . Unlike most McKeen cars, it had a rounded front end instead of the knife-edge prow normally favored; it also featured roof-mounted radiators in addition to those in the normal location behind the pilot.

Despite the extra power, this was only a car with a capacity of 48 passengers. The additional power was needed for the severe grades (max. 4.92%) and curvature of the line between Price and Hiawatha for which it was intended.

The car was apparently not a success and did not last long in service,
being withdrawn from service in June 1917 and dismantled, the engine and power truck being sold.
The carbody was used as a shop employee locker room for Utah Railway (successor to Southern Utah Railroad) at Martin until it was dismantled in 1990.
In the mid &#x27;90s the dismantled #100 was then purchased by a Utah Railway employee who also had a farm near Helper. To move the car, he cut it in half at the vestibule and used the rail car as two separate storage units. In 2015, the two halves were then traded for two sea containers by Bently enterprises LLC. It was then moved to Minden, Nevada and is undergoing restoration.

===Locomotives===

The company produced at least one gasoline-engined locomotive. A locomotive was produced in about 1913 and worked around the company shops in Omaha;
A locomotive (probably the same one) was tested in the UP&#x27;s Aspen Tunnel. A locomotive, numbered 5 but possibly again the same one, was documented in the contemporary trade press, photos of which are below.

It is described as being of 0-4-2 wheel arrangement, with the engine mounted across the car as normal and driving the rearmost driving axle in the normal McKeen fashion. Siderods transferred the drive to the other pair of driven wheels. The arrangement was largely identical to the three-axle lead truck on the unique Southern Utah Railway McKeen car.

Zeitler documents this locomotive as having a tractive effort of . The frame was cast steel, and the superstructure constructed of steel, with sufficient solidity to add structural strength; the horizontal cast steel engine bed was also described as a structural member. The straight-6 engine had an bore and stroke, for a total displacement of ; it developed .

Schopp documents that a locomotive was sold to the Motley County Railroad in 1915, and speculates that this may also have been the same single locomotive. In the same article, he recounts a locomotive reported as being stored at the Omaha shops in 1917 that may have been the same locomotive once more.

Another McKeen locomotive was created by the Charles City Western Railway of Iowa by building a wooden boxcab superstructure atop a McKeen power truck.

==Surviving McKeen products==
The Nevada State Railroad Museum has restored a full McKeen car, Virginia and Truckee Railway Motor Car 22, a 1910-built 70 foot car.
This was one of the last McKeen cars to be still running with its original motor. It made its last run in September 1945 and its body was sold in 1946 for service as a roadside diner, later to be used for a plumbing supply store in Carson City, Nevada. Donated to the Museum in 1996, its first run was on May 9, 2010, the car&#x27;s hundredth anniversary of construction.
The original powerplant did not survive and no other McKeen engines could be located. Consequently, a modern diesel engine was fitted to allow the car to operate up to the original maximum speed. The fully restored McKeen motorcar was put back into operation on May 9, 2010, right on schedule for its 100th anniversary of its construction. The motorcar is now being used at the Nevada State Railroad Museum In Carson City Nevada for special occasions such as Independence Day and Nevada Day

The NSRM also owns the remains of a second McKeen car which was converted into a diesel-electric switching locomotive.

Another McKeen body, construction number 83/103, survives in Ramona, California. It originally belonged to the San Diego Cuyamaca &amp; Eastern Railroad then was later sold to the Yuma Valley Railroad before arriving in Alaska around 1921, being re-engined and round-nosed in 1924, converted to an unpowered trailer in 1935 and finally retired in the late 1940s after serving in the 714th Railway Battalion during WWII.
The car, originally named the &quot;Cuyamaca&quot;, is now undergoing restoration by Madison Kirkman of the McKeen Motor Car Company Historical Society.

Two unpowered McKeen trailers survive; one is a storage shed in St. Helena, California. while the other is at the Illinois Railway Museum.

<doc id="1218450" wikidata="Q532440" url="?curid=1218450" title="Sundarbans National Park">
<text>Sundarbans National Park is a national park in West Bengal, India, and core part of tiger reserve and biosphere reserve. It is part of the Sundarbans on the Ganges Delta and adjacent to the Sundarban Reserve Forest in Bangladesh. It is located to south-west of Bangladesh. The delta is densely covered by mangrove forests, and is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. It is also home to a variety of bird, reptile and invertebrate species, including the salt-water crocodile. The present Sundarban National Park was declared as the core area of Sundarban Tiger Reserve in 1973 and a wildlife sanctuary in 1977. On 4 May 1984 it was declared a national park. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed in 1987, and it has been designated as a Ramsar site since 2019. It is considered as a World Network of Biosphere Reserve (Man and Biosphere Reserve) from 1989.

The first forest management division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A forest division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893–1898.

In 1911, it was described as a tract of unexamined waste country and was excluded from the census. It then stretched for about from the mouth of the Hugli to the mouth of the Meghna river and was bordered inland by the three settled districts of the 24 parganas, Khulna and Bakerganj. The total area (including water) was estimated at . It was a water-logged jungle, in which tigers and other wild beasts abounded. Attempts at reclamation had not been very successful. The Sundarbans was everywhere intersected by river channels and creeks, some of which afforded water communication throughout the Bengal region both for steamers and for native ships. The maximum part of the delta is located in Bangladesh.

== Administration ==
The Directorate of Forest is responsible for the administration and management of the Sundarbans. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Wildlife &amp; Bio-Diversity &amp; ex-officio Chief Wildlife Warden, West Bengal, is the senior most executive officer looking over the administration of the park. The Chief Conservator of Forests (South) &amp; Director, Sundarban Biosphere Reserve is the administrative head of the park at the local level and is assisted by a deputy field director and an assistant field director. The park area is divided into two ranges, overseen by range forest officers. Each range is further sub-divided into beats. The park also has floating watch stations and camps to protect the property from poachers.

The park receives financial aid from the state government as well as the Ministry of Environment and Forests under various plan and non-plan budgets. Additional funding is received under the Project Tiger from the Central Government. In 2001, a grant of US$20,000 was received as preparatory assistance for promotion between India and Bangladesh from the World Heritage Fund.

==Geography==
The Sundarban National Park is located between 21° 432′ – 21° 55′ N latitude and between 88° 42′ – 89° 04′ E longitude. The average altitude of the park is 7.5 m above sea level. The park is composed of 54 small islands and intersected by several distributaries of the Ganges river.

=== Climate ===
The average minimum and maximum temperature is 20 °C and 48 °C respectively. Rainfall is heavy with humidity as high as 80% as it is close to the Bay of Bengal. The monsoon lasts from mid-June to mid-September. Prevailing wind is from the north and north-east from October to mid-March and southwest westerlies prevails from mid-March to September. Storms which sometimes develop into cyclones are common during the months of May to October.

===Eco-geography, rivers and watercourses===
Seven main rivers and innumerable watercourses form a network of channels at this estuarine delta. All the rivers have a southward course towards the sea. The eco-geography of this area is totally dependent on the tidal effect of two flow tides and two ebb tides occurring within 24 hours with a tidal range of 3–5 m and up to 8 m in normal spring tide, inundating the whole of Sundarban in varying depths. The tidal action deposits silts back on the channels and raising the bed, it forms new islands and creeks contributing to uncertain geomorphology. There is a great natural depression called the &quot;Swatch of No Ground&quot; in the Bay of Bengal between 21°00&#x27; to 21°22&#x27; latitude where the depth of water changes suddenly from 20 m to 500 m. This mysterious depression pushes back the silts towards south and/or further east to form new islands.
===Mudflats===
The Sunderban mudflats are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The interior parts of the mudflats are the right environment for mangroves.

There are a number of mudflats outside Sundarbans National Park that have the potential to be tourist spots in the Sundarbans. One can visit them and enjoy the beauty of the place during low tide. If one is lucky, one can see sea anemones, horseshoe crab (Nearing extinction) and small octopus.

===Flora and fauna===
The coastal active delta of Sundarban at the mouth of Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh, having a complex geomorphologic and hydrological character with climatic hazards, has a vast area of mangrove forests with a variety of flora and diverse fauna in a unique ecosystem. The natural environment and coastal ecosystem of this Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site is under threat of physical disaster due to unscientific and excessive human interferences. Conservation and environmental management plan for safeguarding this unique coastal ecology and ecosystem is urgently required.

====Flora====
Sundarban has achieved its name from the tree. The word, &quot;Sundari&quot;, comes from the Sanskrit word &quot;Sundara&quot;. It is the most exquisite variety of tree that are found in this area, a special kind of mangrove tree. It has specialised roots called pneumatophores which emerge above ground and help in gaseous exchange i.e. respiration. During the rainy season when the entire forest is waterlogged, the spikes rising from the ground has their peak in the air and helps in the respiration process.

====Endangered species====
The endangered species that lives within the Sundarbans are royal Bengal tiger, saltwater crocodile, river terrapin, olive ridley turtle, Ganges river dolphin, hawksbill turtle and mangrove horseshoe crab.

====Marine mammals====

The proposed &quot;Sundarbans Cetacean Diversity Protected Area&quot;, includes the coastal waters off Sundarbans that host critical habitats for endangered cetaceans; resident groups of Bryde&#x27;s whales, a newly rediscovered critical population of Irrawaddy dolphins, Spinner dolphins, Ganges river dolphins, and Chinese white dolphins. Indo-Pacific finless porpoises, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, and Pantropical spotted dolphins are also regularly found in this area, while Minke whales and Rough-toothed dolphins and False killer whales are rarer.

==Management and special projects==
The Bengal tiger is the commonly found species in the park. Having protection since its creation, the core area is free from all human disturbances such as collection of wood, honey, fishing, and other forest products. However, in the buffer area, these activities are permitted in limited form. The forest staff, using motorboats and launches, protect the park from illegal poaching and theft. Forest offices and camps are located at several important parts of the park. Under the supervision of a range officer, two or three experienced workers manage anti-poaching camps.

Habitat of wildlife is maintained through eco-conservation, eco-development, training, education and research. Ten Forest Protection Committees and 14 Eco-development Committees have been formed in the fringe of Sundarbans Tiger Reserve to help in this regard. Seminars, workshops and awareness camps are organised in the vicinity of park to educate the people on eco-conservation, eco-development, and such other issues. Mangrove and other plants are planted in the fringe area to meet the local need of fuel wood for about 1000 villages and to conserve the buffer area. Conservation of soil is done to maintain the ecological balance. Several sweet water ponds have been dug up inside the park to provide drinking water for the wild animals.

Controlling man-eating tigers is another major activity. The number of casualties has been reduced from 40 to 10 per year. The reduction in number of casualties is a result of strict control over the movement of the people inside the tiger reserve, alternative income generation and awareness building among people. It is also believed that due to use of human masks and electric human dummies the tigers will stay away from the people. Straying of tigers into nearby villages is prevented through measures such as nylon net fencing and solar illumination of villages. The youths of the villages are given training in controlling the straying of tigers into the villages.

The Mangrove Interpretation Centre is established at Sajnekhali to make the local people and tourists aware of the importance of conservation of nature in general and specially the mangrove ecosystems.

===Constraints===
Though protection exists in the park, there are a few loopholes. The geographical topography with hostile terrain cris-crossed by several rivers and their tributaries, long international border with Bangladesh, fishing trawlers and launches enables poaching and the cutting of wood, affecting the mangrove forests. Lack of staff, infrastructure and lack of funds exacerbate the situation.

==Park-specific information==

The only means of travelling the park is by boat, down the various lanes formed by the many flowing rivers. Local boats or vessels operated by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, namely &quot;M.V. Chitrarekha&quot; and &quot;M.V. Sarbajaya&quot;. Accommodation on land and cruise safaris are provided by &quot;Sunderban Tiger Camp&quot;, the only government-approved resort in the region. They conduct fixed departures and private tours from Kolkata throughout the year.
Apart from viewing the wildlife from boat safaris, visitors also visit the Sudhanyakali Watch Tower, Dobanki Watch Tower, Burirdabri Watch Tower, Netidhopani Watch Tower, Sajnekhali Bird Sanctuary, Bhagabatpur Crocodile Project (a crocodile breeding farm), Sagar Island, Jambudweep, Haliday Island, and Kanak.

== Sunderban Tiger Reserve ==

===Background===
The Sunderban Tiger Reserve is located in the South 24 Parganas district of the Indian state of West Bengal, and has a total geographical area of 2585 km2, with 1437.4 km2 consisting of populated areas and forest covering the remaining 1474 km2. The Sunderban landscape is contiguous with the mangrove habitat in Bangladesh.

Sunderban mangroves form part of the largest mangrove system of the Indian subcontinent with a tiger population in a distinct ecological setting. These forests have saltwater crocodiles, estuarine and marine turtles, and a number of bird species. The reserve also contains species of the fishing cat, spotted deer, rhesus monkey, and wild pig.

The Sunderban is isolated with no forest connection to other tiger-occupied mainlands. Due to this, there is heavy biotic pressure for forest resources. On average, 50 metric tonnes of honey and 3 metric tonnes of wax are collected each year by locals under licence from the Indian Forest Service. The habitat is traversed by many narrow tidal channels forming small to large islands. Tigers readily cross these islands and human-tiger interactions are common.

The estimation of tiger population in Sunderban, as a part of the all India tiger estimation using the refined methodology, could not be carried out owing to the unique habitat and obliteration of evidences due to high and low tides. Phase-I data collection has been completed and process is on for tiger estimation using a combination of radio telemetry and pugmark deposition rate from known tigers. A 2022 survey by the National Tiger Conservation Authority photographed 100 unique tigers.

===Damage from Cyclone Aila===

Cyclone Aila struck Sunderban on 25 May 2009, causing damage to field camps and fringe villages bordering the reserve. Breaches in the embankments on the village side have caused large scale flooding, leaving lakhs of people marooned in the area. The field camps were under 12 to 15 feet of water for around seven hours, resulting in soil erosion and damage to staff quarters, generators and bamboo pilling. There was a report of a tiger wandering inside an abandoned cattle shed in a village, which was captured and released back in the wild. No tiger death has been reported, apart from the mortality of two spotted deer. Several NGOs have been involved in the relief operation.

The Forest Department of the State has constituted a Committee and has assessed damage of almost Rs. 11150,000. Central assistance amounting to Rs. 10 million under Project Tiger has been provided to the State for restoring the damage done to infrastructure.

=== Damage from Cyclone Amphan ===
Cyclone Amphan made landfall near Sagar Island of South 24 Parganas district on 20 May 2020. Lives have been lost and damage has been meted out to infrastructure. The cyclone damaged &quot;almost the entire nylon fencing&quot; in the forest which prevents the tigers from entering the forest-fringe villages, thereby keeping a check on the man-animal conflict. Besides the fencing, the cyclone also damaged &quot;dozens of forest camp offices, tents, watch towers and staff quarters&quot;. The West Bengal Forest Department were initially apprehensive about tigers being harmed or killed by the cyclone but the post cyclone patrolling revealed no dead bodies of the tigers and instead offered glimpses of the animals roaming around in the forest.

===Challenges===
The Sunderban Tiger Reserve has several challenges to its future operations. Due to wandering tigers, human-tiger conflict continues to be an issue. Sunderban tigers hunt humans, and it is estimated that over a thousand of the local people have been killed by tigers over the past four decades. An estimation of the number of tigers present in the reserve using the refined method has not yet been completed. A tiger conservation plan is awaited as are constitutions for the State level Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of the Chief Minister and the reserve-specific Tiger Conservation Foundation.

== Sundarban Transport ==
Air: Sundarban National Park is located 140 kilometres from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, which operates international flights across the world.

Rail: The nearest railway station to Sundarbans National Park is Canning railway station which is located 29 km far from the Gate way of Sundarban (i.e. Godhkhali).

Road: The national park can be accessed from Kolkata via West Bengal&#x27;s State Highway 3.

==Ecosystem valuation==
A 2015 economic assessment study of the Sundarbans estimated that the national park provides flow benefits worth ₹12.8 billion (approximately ₹50,000 per hectare of land) annually.

Important ecosystem services and their annual valuations include nursery function (₹5.17 billion), gene-pool protection (₹2.87 billion), provisioning of fish (₹1.6 billion) and waste assimilation services (₹1.5 billion). The study also mentioned services such as the generation of employment for local communities (₹36 million), moderation of cyclonic storms (₹275 million), provision of habitat and refugia for wildlife (₹360 million) and sequestration of carbon (₹462 million).

<text>Ruthven Campbell Todd (pronounced &#x27;riven&#x27;) (14 June 1914 – 11 October 1978) was a Scottish poet, artist and novelist, best known as an editor of the works of William Blake, and expert on his printing techniques. During the 1940s he also wrote detective fiction under the pseudonym R. T. Campbell
 and children&#x27;s fiction during the 1950s.

==Biography==
===Edinburgh and the early years===

Born in Edinburgh,
Todd was the eldest of the ten children of Walker Todd (an architect) and Christian Todd (née Craik). He was educated at Dalhousie Preparatory School, Fettes College and Edinburgh College of Art. His short spell at art college convinced him that he had no creative talent as an artist and he thereafter pursued his ambition to become a poet and writer. At Fettes and at art college he had proved to be a rebellious teenager and he left college prematurely to be sent by his parents to work for two years as an agricultural labourer on the Isle of Mull. He then returned to Edinburgh to begin a career in copy-writing and journalism, while writing poetry and novels. He left Edinburgh for London in 1935.

===London and Essex===
He lived in a variety of types of accommodation in central London until the flat he was renting in Bloomsbury was hit by a flying bomb in 1944. He then moved to Tilty Mill House near Dunmow in Essex (later rented to poet and novelist Elizabeth Smart).

During the 1930s, he had become friendly with Dylan Thomas, Louis MacNeice, Geoffrey Grigson, Norman Cameron, David Gascoyne and Len Lye. He became a life-long friend of Julian Symons, and a character based on Todd was included in Symons&#x27; first detective story, &quot;The Immaterial Murder Case&quot;. He also knew Wyndham Lewis, contributing to the Lewis issue of Julian Symons&#x27;s &quot;Twentieth Century Verse&quot;. Lewis recruited Todd to keep awake the dozing Ezra Pound, whose portrait Lewis was painting. He was secretary to the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition, during which he was memorably required to rescue Salvador Dalí from suffocating inside a heavy diving suit. In 1937 he worked for a period for Mass-Observation where he developed lasting friendships with Humphrey Jennings and Kathleen Raine. During this period, and throughout his life, Todd struggled to keep afloat financially and had to supplement a meagre and uncertain income from writing poetry and novels by writing reviews, tutoring and copy-writing.

Todd&#x27;s two allegorical novels &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Lost Traveller&quot; (1943) both feature protagonists on symbolic journeys; Todd acknowledged the influence of Lewis and Rex Warner on the latter novel. &quot;Over the Mountain&quot;, a satire on fascism, has its hero travel to a dystopian nation with an oppressive government. During World War II he was a conscientious objector. Near the start of the war, he began work on an ambitious project in collaboration with the William Blake expert Sir Geoffrey Keynes to compile a catalogue raisonné of the artworks of William Blake. The project was to be abandoned in 1947, after Todd moved to New York, but not before a great deal had been achieved.

===United States===
Todd moved to the United States in 1947, where he lived for the next twelve years, becoming a US citizen in 1959. He resided initially in New York where he became friendly with the writers Alastair Reid and Howard Schoenfeld. He worked in the summer of 1947 at Stanley William Hayter&#x27;s Atelier 17 printing workshop, where he collaborated with Joan Miró and other artists in experiments relating to William Blake&#x27;s printing methods. He founded and ran the Weekend Press during the early 1950s, and received friendship and some financial support from W. H. Auden. He was one of the main participants in the events surrounding Dylan Thomas&#x27;s death in 1953. In 1954 he moved to live on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard where he began to write children&#x27;s fiction, with the launch of the &quot;Space Cat&quot; series. In 1959 he was commissioned by the Trustees of the Dylan Thomas Estate to write the official biography of Thomas. However, he was forced to abandon the work three years later and the job passed to Constantine Fitzgibbon.

===Mallorca===
In 1960, Todd moved to Mallorca, briefly living in the village of Deià, where he became a friend of Robert Graves, before settling at El Terreno in Palma de Mallorca. He moved in 1965 to the mountain village of Galilea where he spent the remainder of his life. During the 1970s he visited the US on a number of occasions to give lecture courses on Creative Writing and William Blake at the Universities of Buffalo and Maryland. He died in Galilea from emphysema in 1978.

The first biography of Ruthven Todd was published in 2018, and a bibliography of his works was published in 2020.

==Personal life==

In 1937, Todd married Cicely Crew, daughter of the geneticist Professor Francis Crew. They had one son, Christopher, born in 1939. The couple separated in 1943 and were divorced three years later. While living in New York in 1949, Todd was briefly and unsuccessfully married to Paula Norworth, before a third marriage to the artist and sculptor Joellen Hall in 1952. They divorced in 1956.

Todd had a lifelong interest in the natural world, particularly in plants and fungi, and was a knowledgeable amateur mycologist. He was also a highly skilled illustrator of wild flowers and fungi. He made some money from selling his drawings, but most were given away to friends.

From his teenage years and throughout his life, Todd was a chronic alcoholic. He underwent treatment for addiction in 1965, but this was only partially successful. He was also a chain-smoker and suffered from frequent bouts of pulmonary illness.

<text>Jens Weißflog (; born 21 July 1964) is an East German and later German former ski jumper. He is one of the best and most successful ski jumpers in the history of the sport. He is a two time olympic and nordic world ski champion; also overall world winner.

==Career==
Weißflog was born in Erlabrunn (now a part of Breitenbrunn) in Saxony.

===Olympics and Four Hills Tournament===
As a 19-year-old he won the Four Hills Tournament for East Germany in 1983/84. Weißflog was known as &quot;Floh&quot; (flea in German) due to his slight stature and his light body. That same winter he won the combined World Cup and later the normal hill event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The following winter was dominated by Weißflog and the outstanding Finn Matti Nykänen.

The most remarkable part of his career is that he competed at the top level for twelve years. Neither the regime change from East Germany to the unified Germany in late 1990, nor the change in ski jumping techniques from the parallel technique to the V-style around 1993 stopped his success. 

In 1994 he won two gold medals in the individual large hill and team large hill events at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, ten years after his first Olympic victory. Controversially, he committed one of the most unsporting acts in winter sports history, when he congratulated Japan&#x27;s last team jumper with the victory, before the competition was over. The japanese failed miserably with his jump, while Weissflog did not, and thus Germany won the gold. In the next event, Weissflog was duly booed by approximately 40 000 spectators, who all regarded this former act as most unfair play, and a very dirty move. Weissflog responded by flipping the bird to the spectators, who did not warm further to him.

He finished his career in 1996 by becoming the first ski jumper to win the combined Four Hills Tournament four times. Only the Finn Janne Ahonen has surpassed that record by winning the Four Hills Tournament five times. He had also earned five-second-place finishes in the competition over the course of his career. After this achievement he retired from professional sport.

===World Championships===
At the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, Weißflog won two golds in the individual normal hill (1985, 1989), three silvers in the individual large hill (1989) and team large hill (1984 and 1995), and four bronzes in the individual large hill (1991, 1993) and team large hill (1985 and 1991). He also won two medals at the FIS Ski Flying World Championships with a silver in 1985 and a bronze in 1990.

Weißflog also won the ski jumping competition at the Holmenkollen ski festival twice (1989, 1990). He was awarded the Holmenkollen medal in 1991 (shared with Vegard Ulvang, Trond Einar Elden, and Ernst Vettori).

==Life after the career==
Today, Jens Weißflog owns a hotel in his home town of Oberwiesenthal and is the main ski jump commentator for German television station ZDF.

<doc id="1218471" wikidata="Q7729868" url="?curid=1218471" title="The Detectives (1993 TV series)">
<text>The Detectives is a British comedy television series, starring Jasper Carrott, Robert Powell, and George Sewell. It aired on BBC One from 27 January 1993 to 28 December 1997, and was a spoof of police dramas. It was written by Mike Whitehill and Steve Knight.

==Concept==
&quot;The Detectives&quot; originated from a recurring sketch that first appeared on Jasper Carrott&#x27;s comedy show &quot;Canned Carrott&quot;. Because of its success, it was turned into a television series. There were a few differences from the sketch to the TV series, such as Dave Briggs being married in the sketch (to Brenda), while in the series, both he and Louis are single and hopeless at romance.

Jasper Carrott and Robert Powell play the bumbling detective constables Bob Louis and David Briggs. They were bad at their job, to the despair of their boss, Superintendent Frank Cottam (played by Sewell). However, they usually ended up solving their cases.

The BBC compared it to the series &quot;Special Branch&quot; (1969–74), in which Sewell had also appeared. Mark Lewisohn compared it to &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975–78), describing Sewell&#x27;s role as &quot;a deadpan spin on that series&#x27; Chief Inspector Haskins&quot;. Moreover, the original sketches were introduced by a blue-tinted sequence and musical score that parodied &quot;The Sweeney&quot;&#x27;s opening titles.

Each episode showcased different guest stars, and some of them played the same characters they had played in other television series: Leslie Grantham appeared as Danny Kane from &quot;The Paradise Club&quot;, while John Nettles and Terence Alexander reprised their roles from &quot;Bergerac&quot;.

In 2012, BBC1 broadcast a one-off sketch show &quot;The One Jasper Carrott&quot; (part of a series showcasing various comedians) which included an extended sketch about Briggs and Louis having formed an incompetent private detective agency, Sherlock and Holmes (the role of Superintendent was now played by Michael Melia, who had played the character Brian in the second episode of series 1, as George Sewell had died in 2007).

==Characters==

===David Briggs===
Briggs (Robert Powell) usually spoofs the leader of a crime-fighting duo that takes all the risks, leads the cases and comes up with the ideas, but is always unluckier with women.

===Bob Louis===
Though being the cynic and the voice of reason, Bob Louis (Jasper Carrott) is as hopeless as Briggs at flirting with women.

===Superintendent Cottam===
Frank Cottam (George Sewell) is a parody of Sewell&#x27;s earlier character in Euston Films drama &quot;Special Branch&quot;. Cottam usually gives Briggs and Louis dangerous assignments to get rid of them.

===Nozzer===
Nozzer (Tony Selby) is a desk sergeant at West End Central police station. His first episode was in &quot;Rear Window&quot;, although in this episode, the character was a dog handler rather than a desk sergeant. He also appeared in &quot;DC of Love&quot;, &quot;Curse of the Comanches&quot;, &quot;Sacked&quot; and &quot;Best Man&quot;

<text>The Battle of San Pasqual, also spelled San Pascual, was a military encounter that occurred during the Mexican–American War in what is now the San Pasqual Valley community in the county of San Diego, California. The series of military skirmishes ended with both sides claiming victory, and the victor of the battle is still debated. On December 6 and 7, 1846, General Stephen W. Kearny&#x27;s US Army of the West, along with a small detachment of the California Battalion led by Archibald H. Gillespie, engaged a small contingent of Californios and their Presidial Lancers Los Galgos (The Greyhounds), led by Major Andrés Pico. After U.S. reinforcements arrived, Kearny&#x27;s troops were able to reach San Diego.

==Background==
Following a clash of U.S. forces with Mexican forces near the Rio Grande, Colonel Stephen Watts Kearny was promoted to a brigadier general and tasked with multiple objectives to include the seizure of New Mexico and California, establish civilian government within seized territories, disrupt trade, and to &quot;act in such a manner as best to conciliate the inhabitants, and render them friendly to the United States&quot;. Kearny&#x27;s initial force consisted of 300 regular army soldiers, 1,000 volunteers from Missouri, and the Mormon Battalion. From Fort Leavenworth, via Bent&#x27;s Fort, Kearny had New Mexico capitulate without violent conflict. While in Santa Fe, Kearny established Fort Marcy, named after the Secretary of War William L. Marcy, who had ordered Kearny&#x27;s force westward.

En route from New Mexico, Kearny&#x27;s force interacted with the Apache and Maricopa tribes, and captured a Mexican courier with news of American activities in California, with the news stating the Californios had capitulated. Forces under Commodore Sloat had taken control a significant portion of Alta California. Kearny had orders to assume command of U.S. forces in California with his, but sent back most of his force after meeting up with Kit Carson near Socorro on Oct 6 and hearing of the seizure of California by Commodore Robert F. Stockton, Kearny keeping only Companies C &amp; K, 1st Dragoons, about 100 men. Kearny, at that time with a force of 300 men, learning of escalating issues with the Navajo, and with the belief a smaller force could move faster, ordered 200 back to Santa Fe. Kearny&#x27;s force, guided by Carson, reached Warner&#x27;s Ranch in California on Dec 2, travel-weary and in a greatly weakened condition. They had just completed a 2,000 mile march; the longest march in U.S. Army history. The men mounted mules and half-broken horses owned by California Capt. Jose Maria Flores, which they rounded up around Warner Ranch.

General Kearny&#x27;s Army, most originating from Fort Scott:
* Captain Abraham Robinson Johnston – regimental adjutant, Company K, 12 mounted dragoons
* Captain Benjamin (Ben) Daviess Moore – Company C, 60 dismounted dragoons, some mounted on mules
* Captain Henry Smith Turner – Kearny&#x27;s Army of the West Adjutant general
* Lieutenant William H. Emory – Chief Topographical Engineer, Corps of Topographical Engineers
* Lieutenant William H. Warner – Corps of Topographical Engineers, commanding four topographical engineering &quot;mountainmen&quot; Peterson, Londeau, Perrot, and Private Francois Menard
* Lieutenant John W. Davidson – commanded two howitzers and six dragoons placed at the rear of the advance
* Second Lieutenant Thomas (Tom) C. Hammond – aide-de-camp
* Major Swords – assistant quartermaster – rear guard for baggage train, officers&#x27; personal slaves, and civilians
* U.S. Army Surgeon (Captain) Dr. John S. Griffin
* Enlisted men:
** Judge Pearce (Kearny&#x27;s personal bodyguard), Sergeant Williams, Pat Halpin (bugler), Sergeant Falls, Sergeant John Cox, Private William B. Dunne, Private David Streeter, Private James Osbourne, (Private) Dr. Erasmus Darwin French (physician assistant)
** Company C: Corporal William C. West, Private George Ashmead, Private Joseph T. Campbell, Private John Dunlop, Private William Dalton, Private William C. Leckey, Private Samuel F. Repoll, Private Joseph B. Kennedy,
** Company K: 1st Sergeant Otis L. Moor, Sergeant William Whitness, Corporal George Ramsdale, farrier David W. Johnston, Private William G. Gholston, Private William H. Fiel, Private Robert S. Gregory, Private Hugh McKaffray
Captains Johnston, Griffin (Surgeon), and Turner kept journals during their journey from Santa Fe. Lieutenant W. H. Emory of the Topographical Engineers kept the official designated U.S. Government diary, or &quot;Military Reconnoissance&quot; from Ft. Leavenworth to California which was published in 1848.

After turning back the Americans trying to recapture Los Angeles in the Battle of Dominguez Rancho, Capt. Jose Maria Flores sent about 100 men to San Luis Obispo to confront Lt. Col. John C. Fremont&#x27;s 300 men moving south from Monterey, and sent another 100 men to watch Stockton&#x27;s base at San Diego, but Flores kept the bulk of his men at Los Angeles.

Captain Archibald Gillespie with 39 men, met Kearny on December 5 with a message from Stockton requesting Kearny confront Flores&#x27; men outside San Diego. The total American force now amounted to 179 men.

USMC Acting-Captain (Lt.) Gillespie&#x27;s Mounted Rifle Volunteers &#x27;detachment&#x27; of the California Battalion:
* 10 U.S. Navy carbiners from &#x27;Fleet on the Pacific Coast&#x27; F Company aboard the commanded by Acting-Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald Beale and Passed-Midshipman James M. Duncan (later commanded )
* Sutter Fort&#x27;s Russian brass 4-pounder cannon, which had been hidden after Mexican authorities tried to use the cannon against Californios at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass during the 1831 tax revolt. Charles Weber disclosed its location to Gillespie.
* 26 Mounted Rifle Company, commanded by Acting-Captain (Sgt.) Samual Gibson (later commanded company B of 26th Arkansas Infantry Regiment) and longtime Kit Carson and John Fremont associate, Acting-Lieutenant Alexis Godey: including Antoine Robidoux (interpreter), Philip Crosthwaite, Beatitude Patitoux, William Henry Russell, Daniel Sexton, Franklin Sears, Thomas Burgess, Jean Nutrelle, Private Henry Booker.
* Rafael Machado, Californio guide provided by San Diego

Captains Leonardo Cota and Jose Alipaz took a force to San Pasqual Valley with the intention to interdict and keep in check Captain Gillespie after his departure from San Diego. Later, Major Andrés Pico, after a failed search for a detachment of U.S. soldiers, joined forces with the captains and took command. These Californios led a force consisting of landowners, sons of landowners, and vaqueros, many with well known and respected family names in the community:
* Don Leonardo Cota: Capt. Enrique Abilia (Los Angeles), Capt. Ramon Carillo (Los Angeles), Capt. Jose Maria Cota (Los Angeles), Capt. Carlos Dominguez (Los Angeles), Capt. Nicolas Hermosillo (Los Angeles), Capt. Jose Alipaz (San Juan Capistrano), Capt. Ramon O. Suna (San Diego)
* General Andres Pico: Don Leandro Osuna (San Diego), Capt. Juan Bautista Moreno, Capt. Tomás A. Sanchez, Capt. Pablo Vejar, Capt. Manuel Vejar
On the night of December 5, a Native American informed the Californio forces of the presence of Kearny&#x27;s forces.

==Prelude==
A dragoon patrol under Lieutenant Thomas C. Hammond, guided by Rafael Machado, the son of Don José Manuel Machado (grantee of Rancho El Rosario and sent by the Machado family to assist Kearny), reconnoitered Capt. Andres Pico&#x27;s force along the road at San Pasqual.

While Machado sneaked into the camp, Lt. Hammond became suspicious he was being set up for an ambush and rode the dragoons into the camp, where they spoke with an Indian they found sleeping in a hut. In a coincidence that has never been fully explained, a guard under the command of Machado&#x27;s concuñado, the brother of a brother-in-law and future father-in-law, Captain Jose Alipaz, challenged the dragoons and alerted the camp to their presence. While Machado quickly ran back to Hammond&#x27;s scouting party, Alipaz sounded the alarm but was dismissed by General Pico, until a U.S. Army blanket and dragoon coat were discovered on the edge of camp by Pablo Véjar. With Capt. Alipaz, Captain Leonardo Cota and José María Ibarra (the Californio standing guard) chased the dragoons to the top of the next ridge with the battle cry of &quot;!Viva California!&quot;. Pico was alerted, and the Californio camp prepared for the U.S. Army dragoons and marines to attack.

Kearny had planned a surprise attack at daylight, despite the damp weather wetting down their powder and the extremely poor state of the soldiers&#x27; equipment and mounts – mostly mules, as the horses had died on the preceding march.

==Battle==

Having lost the element of surprise, at midnight Kearny ordered an immediate advance from his camp nine miles away. It had rained that night. Men, muskets, pistols and equipment were wet and cold, but the troops, after over six months without any action, were eager to engage the Californios. Early in the morning of December 6, 1846, the column proceeded by twos across the ridge between Santa Maria (present day Ramona, California) and San Pasqual. During the descent, while it was still dark and with a low-lying fog, Kearny&#x27;s force became strung out and were caught in a disadvantageous position by General Pico&#x27;s swift advance. Kearny gave the plan of battle prior to proceeding down into the valley, to keep all casualties to a minimum, to encircle San Pasqual to capture fresh mounts.

Captain Abraham R. Johnston&#x27;s advance guard, while still three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) from Pico&#x27;s forces, was ordered by Kearny to &quot;Trot!&quot;, which Johnston misunderstood as &quot;Gallop!&quot;. Seeing this Kearny exclaimed &quot;Oh, heavens! I did not mean that!&quot;. Forty of the best mounted pulled far ahead of the main body of the force, in violation of the &quot;Cavalry Tactics&quot; manual of 1841, which instructed a charge to begin at just 40 paces from the enemy &quot;so as to arrive in good order, and without fatiguing the horses.&quot; The mules pulling the howitzers bolted, taking one of the guns with them. Pico&#x27;s mounted force remained ahead of the pursuing U.S. forces. Their fresh horses and superior horsemanship allowed them to outmaneuver and lead the advance group of dragoons away from the main force. The Californios had a distinct advantage over the U.S. soldiers in their knowledge of the terrain. A second separation developed until twenty-eight dragoons, including Kearny, were separated. Damp powder reduced the effectiveness of carbines to clubs and pistols to hammers, as described by &quot;Felicita&quot; a San Pasqual Indian that witnessed the battle. The Californios were armed with long lances and reatas (braided rawhide lariat), which they used with great effect. As a consequence, Johnston&#x27;s charge was unsupported and his dragoons were forced to withdraw.

As the leading element of the U.S. force&#x27;s attack drew close to a Kumeyaay village, the Californios wheeled back and fired their few firearms. At this time Captain Johnston was killed by a bullet. Pico then withdrew a half mile to higher ground.

A second charge ordered by Capt. Benjamin D. Moore further separated the Americans, and the Californios met his dragoons with a counter-charge by lancers. The charge was quickly surrounded, and Capt. Moore was killed. Gillespie arrived within fifteen minutes with the artillery. Mules are reluctant to wheel, and the horse-mounted Californios outflanked the Americans and captured one of the unattended howitzers. Gillespie used a sabre to fight off a vicious personal attack made by a group of lancers in revenge for his previous actions during his occupation of Los Angeles and the broken agreement to cease hostilities. He took a lance thrust just over the heart that pierced a lung. Kearny was wounded when he was lanced. Other U.S. dragoons were worked on by pairs of Californios who, with fresh mounts and years of practice, would use a lasso to yank soldiers off their mounts to the ground, where the second rider would lance them. Gillespie&#x27;s men unlimbered the remaining howitzer – John Sutter&#x27;s Russian-made bronze four-pounder – and were able to drive the Californio fighters from the field after Midshipman Duncan fired canister into them. Either this action (traditional U.S. view) or the unusual degree of bloodshed (traditional Californio view), prompted Pico to withdraw. The U.S. forces fortified a camp on a low hill north of the valley, initially placing their dead on mules that were unable to transport them before burying them outside of the camp under cover of darkness. The location of this camp is within the modern day San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

Summarizing the battle, historian Owen Coy writes: Coy goes on to write: 

==After the battle==

=== Six messengers ===
The next day, December 7, 1846, after assurances by Dr. Griffin that the worst of the injured could be moved, Captain Turner, now in command of the Dragoons, since Kearny was wounded, marched the column toward San Diego. Californio lancers established a blocking position near what is now known as &quot;Mule Hill&quot;. Captain Turner ordered Lieutenant William H. Emory and a squad of dragoons to engage and drive off the menacing lancers. With dry powder in their carbines, the dragoons easily forced the lancers away, while inflicting five dead among the fleeing Californios. That evening, Captain Turner, established a strong defensive perimeter and then sent dispatches requesting urgent reinforcements, carried to Commodore Stockton by &quot;Alexis Godey, Thomas Burgess, and one other.&quot; On December 8, there still had been no word from the three messengers, when suddenly there appeared a white flag from the Californios. The Lancers wished to trade &quot;four Americans whom [they] wished to exchange for four Californians. This was embarrassing, because the Americans had but one man, Pablo Vejar, as a prisoner.&quot; With the trade completed, it was learned from the returned men that Stockton had no horses and therefore could not send a relief party. Prior to capture by the Californios on their return trip, they had hid Stockton&#x27;s message under a tree, &quot;but when this cache was examined the letters were missing.&quot; With Kearny somewhat recovering from his wounds, he regained the command from Turner, and Kearny determined to dispatch another detail to San Diego. On the evening of the 8th, Beale and Carson volunteered for the mission, however General Kearny wanted to retain Carson with the command in case he was needed. Lieut. Beale explained to Kearny that the dispatches might not make it through to San Diego without Kit Carson&#x27;s experience. That night Lieut. Beale, Scout Carson, and an Indian guide named &quot;Pontho&quot; moved under cover of darkness, taking different routes to the commodore&#x27;s headquarters at San Diego, 28 miles (45 km) to the south-southwest. For Kit Carson and Pontho (or Panto) the foot journey to San Diego was &quot;a matter of routine.&quot; But &quot;to the young naval officer it was pure torture, and upon his arrival at old town [San Diego], being unable to stand because of his lacerated feet, he had to be carried into Commodore Stockton&#x27;s headquarters.&quot; To insure that at least one messenger would make it through, the three men had separated a few miles from San Diego, Pontho (Panto) was the first to make it, then followed Carson, then later the much suffering naval officer Lieut. Beale.

==Reinforcement and casualties==

Stockton quickly dispatched a unit of over 200 sailors and marines, whose arrival caused the Californios to disperse. Kearny had already determined the night before (December 9) to continue the march the next morning. Stockton&#x27;s unit then escorted Kearny&#x27;s battered troops to San Diego, where they arrived December 12.

Dr. John S. Griffin, Kearny&#x27;s surgeon, reported that the Americans had lost 17 killed and 18 wounded out of the 50 officers and men who engaged Pico&#x27;s lancers. When they arrived in San Diego, the wounded survivors were treated by their Californio guide&#x27;s sister, Nurse Juanita Machado Alipas de Wrightington, known as the Florence Nightingale of San Diego for her charity work for the oppressed native peoples camped outside San Diego.

===Assessment===
General Kearny&#x27;s official report states:
&quot;On the morning of the 7th, having made ambulances for our wounded . . . we proceeded on our march, when the enemy showed himself, occupying the hills in our front, which they left as we approached, till reaching San Bernardo a party of them took possession of a hill near to it and maintained their position until attacked by our advance, who quickly drove them from it, killing and wounding five of their number with no loss on our part.&quot; Some time after the battle, General Kearny wrote that the U.S. had achieved victory since the Californios had &quot;fled the field,&quot; but the Californios saw the engagement as their victory.

According to Kit Carson, who was on the battlefield that day, &quot;Kearny chose to press the attack with an eye to capturing Pico&#x27;s horses.&quot;

With the conclusion of the fight at San Pasqual, San Diego and &quot;all of California north of Santa Barbara were in American hands. Only Los Angeles and its immediate environs were still under control of the Californios.&quot;
The battle is unique, as it was one of the few military battles in the United States that involved elements of the Army, Navy, Marines, and civilian volunteers, all in the same skirmish. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians debated which force won or lost the battle. Clearly, Kearny retained the battle area, the ability to operate and maneuver, and also the initiative, though his losses were significantly higher; however, he did not implement his battle plan, his ammunition was compromised, and he outran his artillery and support. According to Geoffrey Regan:

Historian Lt. Colonel Cory Hollon cited Kearny&#x27;s misjudgments: the battle was arguably unnecessary; the operating environment disadvantaged Kearny; he was unaware, or possibly misinformed, about the character of the threat; Kearny overestimated or misused his friendly forces; and Kearny culminated at San Pasqual because he had overextended his supply chain, resulting in a poorly prepared force facing an underestimated enemy. Hollon states that Kearny&#x27;s misjudgments resulted in nearly disastrous consequences for the Army of the West and put the United States’ plans for conquest and empire in peril. Historian Arthur Woodward wrote, &quot;One can only suppose that Kearny, having made one of the longest marches in the history of the United States Army, was spoiling for a fight and intended to have it.&quot;
In late December 1846, Kearny&#x27;s force began its march to Los Angeles. It consisted of a mixed force of Army dragoons, Navy sailors, Marines, volunteers and artillery. Although there was contention on leadership of U.S. forces in California, this and Stockton&#x27;s combined forces went on to engage the Californios at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel, resulting in a Californio retreat. The following day the Battle of La Mesa resulted in another Californio defeat, leading to the surrender of the Pueblo de Los Ángeles and later the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga. Historian Hollon wrote:

==Legacy==
* Fort Moore was constructed on North Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles, California, originally as an improvised defensive position used by Lt. Gillespie, in honor of Captain Benjamin D. Moore. The Fort Moore Hill Pioneer Memorial further honors Moore and other American pioneers.
* Kearny Mesa, an area of San Diego, was named after Camp Kearny; Camp Kearny was named for Stephen W. Kearny.
* Kit Carson Park, in Escondido, was named for Kit Carson.
* Beale Air Force Base in Marysville, California, was named after Edward Beale, keeping the name of its World War II era army base Camp Beale.
* Camp Gillespie, completed in 1942 during World War II, was named in honor of Lieutenant Archibald Gillespie. In 1944 the federal government transferred the property to the County of San Diego. It rechristened the facility as Gillespie Field, since used as a municipal airport.
* The site of the battle is commemorated as San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park.
* A cross was placed on Battle Mountain in Rancho Bernardo, which has been incorrectly identified as Mule Hill, commemorating the battle. Raised in Easter 1966, it was later dedicated to local residents who died during the Tenerife airport disaster.
* A bronze relief of Beale and Carson contacting Stockton was unveiled at the National Museum in 1910.
* The battle was dramatized in the 1927 film &quot;California&quot;, which starred Tim McCoy as Captain Gillespie.
* In 1931, Joseph Leland Roop created a diorama depicting the battle for the Los Angeles Natural History Museum.

<text>Alexander Stewart Burton, VC (20 January 1893 – 9 August 1915) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Burton was born at Kyneton, in the state of Victoria, on 20 January 1893. His father, a grocer, moved his family to Euroa where he commenced working for a department store. After completing his schooling, Alexander joined his father at the store, working in the ironmongers section.

==First World War==
Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, Burton enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 18 August 1914 and posted to the 7th Battalion. He embarked with the battalion for the Middle East on 19 October 1914. On 25 April 1915, 7th Battalion landed at Gallipoli but Burton was sick and did not reach the frontlines until a week later. He was promoted to the rank of lance corporal on 10 July 1915 for &quot;having volunteered and taken part in the forcing of Saphead D21 in the face of the enemy&quot;.

On 9 August 1915, Burton fought in the Battle of Lone Pine when his company reinforced newly captured Turkish trenches. Burton was one of a party of men that manned a barricade against attacking Turkish soldiers. Killed in this action, he was recommended by his battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harold &quot;Pompey&quot; Elliott, for the award of the Victoria Cross (VC). Two other members of the party, Lieutenant Frederick Tubb and Corporal William Dunstan, were also awarded VCs. Burton&#x27;s VC was gazetted on 15 October 1915; the citation read as follows:

Burton has no known grave and is commemorated on the Lone Pine Memorial. He was subsequently mentioned in despatches by General Sir Ian Hamilton on 28 January 1916.

==The medal==
In early 1916, the VC, along with a cover letter from King George V, was presented to Burton&#x27;s father who later wore it for the homecoming of Frederick Tubb, who was a friend of Burton&#x27;s, and had returned to Australia to convalesce from the wounds received at Lone Pine. Burton&#x27;s VC remained in his family for many years but in 1967, it was donated to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where it is on display.

<doc id="1218486" wikidata="Q1453038" url="?curid=1218486" title="Frederick Townsend Ward">
<text>Frederick Townsend Ward (; November 29, 1831September 22, 1862) was an American sailor and mercenary known for his military service in Imperial China during the Taiping Rebellion. He commanded the Ever Victorious Army, a joint Sino-foreign force, against the Taiping rebels. He remained in command of the Ever Victorious Army until his death in battle in 1862, after which leadership was taken over by Henry Andres Burgevine.

==Early life and education==
Ward was born in Salem, Massachusetts on November 29, 1831. Ward was rebellious in his youth, so his father removed Ward from school in 1847 and found him a position as second mate on the &quot;Hamilton&quot;, a clipper ship commanded by a family friend. Another version is that Ward demanded to leave school.

Life at sea proved difficult. Ward was given authority over many &quot;old salts&quot;. He was thrown overboard after complaints that he gave too many orders for a youth. Captain William Allen recalled that Ward possessed traits of &quot;reckless daring&quot;, but was on the whole a valuable officer.

On the &quot;Hamilton&quot;, Ward sailed from New York to Hong Kong in 1847, but probably saw little beyond the port city because the Qing dynasty forbade foreigners from venturing inland (Hong Kong Island had become a British Crown Colony in 1842, at the end of the First Opium War).

In 1849, Ward enrolled at the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy, now Norwich University in Vermont from 1846 to 1848, where the curriculum included military tactics, strategy, drill, and ceremonies. In 1850 he shipped out as first mate of the clipper ship &quot;Russell Clover&quot;. His father was the captain.

==Filibustering==

Aside from working as a sailor during the 1850s, Ward found employment as a filibuster. Filibustering is &quot;raising private mercenary armies and leading them into other countries to advance either [one&#x27;s own] schemes or those of wealthy sponsors&quot;. Ward worked for the infamous &quot;King of the Filibusters&quot;, William Walker, in Mexico, where he learned how to recruit, train, and command mercenary troops. 

Ward also learned to avoid some of Walker&#x27;s practices and behaviors. Walker had a reputation for being &quot;excessively vain, weak minded and ambitious… his weakness renders him cruel…&quot; During Ward&#x27;s later time in China, he displayed respect and concern for the Western and Chinese troops under his command, whom he referred to as &quot;my people&quot;.

Ward learned about practical warfare during his &quot;filibusteresque&quot; experience in 1854 and when he served as a lieutenant with the French Army in the Crimean War. He learned about weapons, tactics, using riflemen in mobile platoons rather than in fixed firing lines and siege techniques. Ward also learned that the frontal assault was of limited value against disciplined long-range firepower, and he gained experience under fire. He did not serve throughout the entire war, because he was &#x27;allowed&#x27; to resign after being insubordinate to a superior officer.

In 1857, Ward sought work as a mercenary, but when he did not secure such work, he served as the first mate on a coastal steamship in dangerous waters. He worked as a shipping agent in his father&#x27;s New York City office alongside his brother in 1859.

==Shanghai newcomer==

The Gen. Ward came to Penang on the steamer &quot;Ganges&quot; accompanied by the U.S. Minister and was transferred to the USS &quot;Powhatan&quot; on his way to Pekin in May 1859. The American government also at the same time chartered the steamer &quot;Hong Kong&quot; to accompany Ward into the north and to return the remains of Ye Mingchen&#x27;s for interment in Canton, 13 May 1859.

According to a contemporary account written in early 1862, Ward and his brother arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 for the purpose of trading, perhaps as an extension of their father&#x27;s New York office. This may be true, but given Ward&#x27;s activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. He had little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as &quot;lying, swindling and smuggling&quot;. Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area.

While Ward&#x27;s brother set up a trading business in Shanghai, Ward himself took up customary employment as the executive officer on the &quot;Confucius&quot;, an armed riverboat commanded by an American, employed by the Shanghai Pirate Suppression Bureau. The Bureau was organized by Xue Huan and Wu Xu, Shanghai governmental officials who took pains to shield explicit imperial association with Western mercenaries and military, and primarily funded by Yang Fang, a prominent Ningbo banker and mercantilist.

Ward&#x27;s show of bravery and initiative on board the &quot;Confucius&quot; reflected great credit upon him, and the prominent men of Shanghai took notice. His exploits, previous military experience, ability to empathise with local populations and motivate Chinese soldiers, and his stated mercenary intentions, made him an attractive candidate to lead a force of foreign nationals in defense of Shanghai against encroaching Taiping forces.

Wu Xu and Yang Fang both increasingly recognized that such a force was necessary, as Imperial forces, frequently staffed by Confucian scholars and conscripts, rather than experienced commanders and soldiers, had all too often proven unequal to the task of defeating Taiping forces.

Through their contacts with the Western business community, and Ward&#x27;s own relentless self-promotion, in the spring of 1860 Wu and Fang reached out to Ward and became his employers. Ward then began scouring the wharves of Shanghai for every Westerner, sober or otherwise, capable of firing a weapon. With this, the Shanghai Foreign Arms Corps was born, which in defeat, would form the nucleus for the Ever Victorious Army.

==Shanghai Foreign Arms Corps==

In 1860, both Chinese and Westerners would place more faith in a small, motley group of mercenaries than readily available local citizenry, because the average Chinese of the time had little understanding of marksmanship, nor much impetus to defend the Manchu throne. Further, with Taiping armies edging closer to Shanghai, there was no time to train native peasants in either conventional Chinese or Western warfare.

On the Shanghai docks, however, Westerners with diverse military experience existed as &quot;discharged seamen, deserters, and other drifters who made Shanghai their temporary home, and even the gainfully employed could be tempted by the prospect of adventure, high pay, and loot&quot; into joining Western-led mercenary endeavours.

This weapon, already forged, was used by Ward against the Taipings, with the backing of local Shanghai ministers and merchants, in a highly charged political atmosphere in which the Manchu Imperial forces had no desire to show their reliance upon Western powers. By the same token, the diplomats and military men of the Western powers discouraged foreign involvement in domestic Chinese matters, even by Westerners in Chinese employ. The Western powers&#x27; concerns did not relate to principle; they were most concerned about the power of the Taipings to block trade downriver from the interior to Shanghai if neutrality were violated.

By June 1860, Ward had a polyglot force of 100 Westerners, trained in the best small arms (including Colt revolvers) and rifles available for purchase in Shanghai. Protesting that his forces were not fully trained, Ward was forced by his Shanghai backers to take his men into action alongside Imperial forces probing Taiping advances, retaking two captured towns. They were then forced by circumstances (and the urging of their Shanghai backers) to assault the Taiping occupied and fortified city of Songjiang, without artillery—a near-impossible task.

The attack failed, sending the thoroughly defeated force back to Shanghai. However, by mid-July, Ward had recruited additional Westerners and over 80 Filipino &quot;Manilamen&quot;, and purchased several artillery pieces, and once again, his forces assaulted Sung-Chiang (松江). They were successful, but at enormous cost. Out of a force of roughly 250 men, 62 were killed, and 100 were wounded, including Ward himself.

Ward and his forces now gained a notoriety that attracted new recruits (for the pay was attractive, even if looting was discouraged by Ward), and enraged local Westerners who saw Ward as an inflammatory, filibustering element sure to force the Taipings to stop the flow of trade. More disconcertingly, the Taipings themselves were now aware of a new and potent force against them.

On August 2, 1860, Ward led the Foreign Arms Corps against Chingpu (上海青浦), the next town from Sung-chiang on the approaches to Shanghai, and this time the Taiping were prepared. As the Corps stormed a garrison wall, Taiping forces lying in ambush waited for the optimum moment and then delivered a withering barrage of close-range musket fire. Within 10 minutes, the Foreign Arms Corps had suffered 50% casualties, and Ward himself was shot in the left jaw, with an exit wound in the right cheek, scarring him for life and leaving him with a speech impediment.

The force retreated and Ward returned to Shanghai for medical treatment and to attempt to recruit more forces and buy additional artillery. Within several days he and the remnants of the Foreign Arms Corps laid siege to Chingpu and bombarded it with artillery. By this time, the Taiping&#x27;s best military leader Li Xiucheng (李秀成), called Zhong Wang (忠王) or &quot;The Faithful King&quot;, dispatched 20,000 troops downriver to break the siege, sending the Foreign Arms Corps fleeing back to the Songjiang area, where Ward&#x27;s second-in-command, Henry Andres Burgevine (another American fortune seeker), held the Corps briefly together, but it soon &quot;ceased to function as an organized entity&quot;.

Ward returned to Shanghai for further treatment of his injury, and was there while the Zhong Wang&#x27;s forces laid siege, and were beaten back by Western and Imperial forces within the city. Ward left Shanghai (apparently secretly) in late 1860 for further treatment of his facial wound, while the remnants of the Corps remained more or less under the command of Burgevine. After Ward&#x27;s death, Burgevine briefly took command of the force, but could not get along with his Imperial Chinese superiors and struck Yang Fang, whereupon Burgevine was relieved of command; he later went over to the Taiping rebels. In 1865, Burgevine was arrested by Imperial officers and died in a drowning accident.

It is unclear as to whether Yang was still funding the Corps in the late fall of 1860, but upon Ward&#x27;s return in the spring of 1861, Ward was able to attract desired elements of the Corps back to his employ. After his return, Ward tenaciously began to recruit and train replacements for the Foreign Arms Corps, offering terms attractive enough to cause desertion among the many British warships in port. Ward, facing arrest and numerous political difficulties arising from the Western governments&#x27; desire to remain neutral, opted to become a Chinese subject, by entering a seemingly rushed marriage with a Chinese woman. In addition, the provincial governor in Shanghai (who happened to be one of Ward&#x27;s patrons) produced falsified papers (Ward would not become a citizen until February) ostensibly proving his Chinese citizenship. These papers were seemingly convincing enough that the US consul refused to prosecute him, at which point British Admiral James Hope locked him up in a room of his flagship to prevent more British men from being lured into Qing military service. Ward jumped through an open window late one night, and promptly disappeared.

In May 1861, Ward once again led the Foreign Arms Corps into battle at Chingpu, and once again, the assault failed, with heavy casualties. This was the last major engagement of the Foreign Arms Corps in its &quot;primarily Western&quot; configuration.

Judgments as to the effectiveness of the Foreign Army Corps vary depending upon the sympathies of the author. The most recent Ward biographer, Caleb Carr, seems fairly generous in his estimation of Ward&#x27;s accomplishments in his 1992 work. However, perhaps the most authoritative judgment was rendered by Richard J. Smith, who stated:

Repeatedly sent into the field without adequate preparation by Ward&#x27;s frantic sponsors, the poorly trained and ill-disciplined contingent stood virtually no chance of success against Li Xiucheng&#x27;s seasoned troops. Sometimes drunk and always disorderly, the Foreign-Arms Corps depended primarily on the element of surprise and the superiority of Western weapons to obtain victory.

Ward clearly recognized the harsh truth of this statement. He soon embarked upon a new scheme, in which he would reform the more reliable elements of the Corps into the nucleus of an effective fighting force, composed primarily of local Chinese.

==Commander of the Ever Victorious Army==

Credit for the concept of training Chinese in Western military tactics and arming them with the best available weaponry is sometimes given to Ward, other times to Li Hongzhang, a local Imperial commander &quot;ordered to cooperate with — and keep an eye on — Ward&#x27;s unruly contingent&quot; and other times to Burgevine, who according to some began the training while Ward was recuperating, having been inspired by the sight of a Chinese gun crew acting under French direction.

Perhaps another factor in the reconsideration of local Chinese troops was the changing mood of the local peasantry. Where before they had been unwilling to fight for Manchu primacy, they were now constantly threatened and in some cases occupied by Taiping forces that were, despite their &quot;heavenly&quot; origin, ruthless in their treatment of local populations. Indeed, in many cases informal militias were formed to drive Taiping forces out, and conduct guerilla operations.

Regardless of the concept&#x27;s true origin, Ward became its champion and after his untimely death, no other commander could quite repeat his success. Ward&#x27;s decision to turn to local Chinese forces would ensure his place in history, and help to end the Taiping Rebellion.

By summer 1861, a training camp was established by Xue Huan&#x27;s &quot;right hand man&quot; Wu Xu (吳煦) at Song Chiang (松江), where Ward set up operations. Working with the best of the survivors of the Foreign Arms Corp, and supported by a strong Headquarters staff, Ward trained an increasing number (see below) of Chinese in western small arms, gunnery, tactics, customs and drill and ceremonies. Particular care was taken to train the Chinese to hold their fire until their targets were within effective range. Chinese troops, both Taiping and Imperial, &quot;had a lingering faith… in the intimidating power of noise&quot;.

He even trained them to respond to western bugle calls and verbal commands, and most strikingly, outfitted them in Western-style utility uniforms, color-coded for branch of arms (infantry or artillery), with Indian Sepoy-style turbans. This garb, at first distressing to the Chinese troops, earned them the nickname &quot;Imitation Foreign Devils&quot; among the local populace, as well as a fair share of mockery. In time, as the troops proved themselves the equal of their European counterparts, both on the parade ground and the battlefield, their distinct uniforms would become a point of pride.

Another point of pride was their pay, which was both high and consistent by Chinese standards – a strong recruiting drive that triumphed over most discomfort with unfamiliar uniforms. The pay was high in part to attract new recruits to dangerous work, but also to compensate for the lack of &quot;looting&quot; opportunity. Ward strongly discouraged looting, as he knew the practice turned local populaces against their &quot;liberators&quot;. Other benefits offered to Ward&#x27;s men included better rations, billets, and of course, better chance of survival in combat.

By January 1862, with about one thousand Chinese soldiers trained and ready, Ward stated that his unit was ready for the field – much to the relief of his Shanghai backers, particularly Yang Fang, who had significantly invested both government and private funds into the force&#x27;s recruitment, arms and supplies. This was timely, as within the same month, the Chung Wang&#x27;s forces reentered that region with over 120,000 troops, in an attempt to first cut off, and then enter and occupy Shanghai.

Ward, ever hungry for glory and no doubt seeking redress for his facial injury, welcomed the conflict, and was absolutely confident in his troops&#x27; ability to defend his Songjiang headquarters, while simultaneously operating as &quot;flying columns&quot; to be directed to strategic areas and Taiping vulnerabilities. He soon had several opportunities to test this confidence.

In the middle of January, about 10 miles north of Shanghai in Wu-Sung, and over 25 snow-covered miles from their own headquarters, Ward led his new army into action, under a banner carrying a Chinese rendering of his own name reading &quot;HUA&quot; (華, 华). His forces drove the Taipings from their entrenched positions, despite greater rebel numbers. A week later, after a return march, Ward&#x27;s forces struck at the city of Guangfulin, occupied by over 20,000 Taiping troops, just five miles from Ward&#x27;s own headquarters.

Ward, at the head of five hundred men, attacked the city without artillery support. The defenders, seeing the strange attire, military skill and foreign leadership of their own countrymen, wavered and &quot;were filled with dismay and fled precipitately.

In February, again facing Taiping forces moving near his training area, Ward took five hundred troops and in joint operations with local Imperial commanders, drove the rebels from Yinchipeng, Chenshan, Tianmashan, and other areas around Songjiang. In the course of these actions against superior numbers, thousands of Taiping were killed or wounded, while Ward himself suffered five wounds, including the loss of a finger to a musket ball.

Li Xiucheng, enraged at this foreign irritant, had a force of 20,000 attack Songjiang, defended only by Ward&#x27;s force of about 1,500 men. Upon approach, rebel forces came under the fire of camouflaged artillery and lost over 2,000 men. Immediately thereafter infantry struck out of the city at the rebels, and cut off and captured another 800, while capturing a large number of boats bearing Taiping supplies and arms.

The Taipings beat a hasty retreat, rather than lay siege to such a hornet&#x27;s nest. It was this moment, perhaps, that secured Ward&#x27;s reputation among all the people of the Shanghai area; Chinese, Western and Taiping alike. From this moment on, the key Western commanders and politicians would support him, funds for troops would flow relatively freely from Imperial coffers, and his decisions would no longer be second-guessed by his backers in Shanghai.

By March 1862, Ward&#x27;s force would be officially named by the Qing government, and to history, as the &quot;Ever Victorious Army&quot;, and Ward himself would be made first a 4th-rank, and then a 3rd-rank mandarin, high honors from the Manchu court for a &quot;barbarian&quot;.

Through the course of 1862, the Ever Victorious Army (常勝軍) would essentially live up to its name, repeatedly defeating numerically superior opponents, often in entrenched positions. Further, its presence on the battlefield and example of effective Chinese soldiering served as a &quot;force multiplier&quot; for Imperial Anhui units commanded by Li Hongzhang, between whom and Ward mutual respect grew during joint operations.

During the summer, Ward&#x27;s &quot;duckfoot&quot; background found immediate application to the problems of land warfare. The Chung Wang&#x27;s growing Taiping forces in the area led to multiple threats at multiple points across the region. Clearly, mobility was needed for Ward&#x27;s limited forces, but the road system was inadequate.

While another commander might have tried to solve the problem through additional wagons and horses, Ward saw the rivers and canals criss-crossing the region not as obstacles, but as passageways. He quickly secured the use of several river steamers, fitted them out as mobile artillery and troop transports, and increased his army&#x27;s effectiveness several times over. Li Xiucheng himself later &quot;attributed his defeats in the Suzhou area to Western steamers. Taiping land forces could contend with &#x27;foreign devils,&#x27; he believed, but rebel water forces could not&quot;.

Throughout this time, Ward&#x27;s reputation continued to grow. Ward himself, outwardly caring little for public adulation, still sought to quench some inner need for further glory, and hoped to participate in an eventual strike against Nanjing, the Taiping capital, but this was not to be. The Manchu court, suspicious of Ward from the beginning, grew even more concerned that as time passed, he refused to shave his forehead, wear a queue or even appear in his fine Mandarin robes. These and other comments regarding his ambitions led the court to limit the size of his unit far beneath his potential to recruit for it, and to give Ward far less rein than they would have to a commander with more Confucian leanings.

By September, the Ever Victorious Army would number over 5,000 men, organized in four battalions as well as an artillery corps, with several riverboats used for transport and mobile artillery.

==Death in battle==

Ward was mortally wounded in the Battle of Cixi, about 10 miles from Ningbo on September 21, 1862, when he was shot in the abdomen. One version is that he was wounded at the base of the city wall. Ward had survived 14 previous battlefield injuries.

Ward lingered for a day. During that time he dictated a will ensuring his brother, sister and Chinese wife, Chang Meihua, would be cared for; he died on the morning of September 22, 1862. A poor man when he entered China, Ward became able in his will to also bequeath a large sum of money towards the Union cause in his own country&#x27;s Civil War.

==Legacy==

Just as the events of the American Civil War overshadowed Ward&#x27;s accomplishments in China during his life, his reputation after his death was overshadowed by Charles George Gordon, aka &quot;Chinese Gordon&quot;, a British Army officer. After Ward&#x27;s death, the command of the Ever-Victorious Army passed to his second in command, Henry Andres Burgevine, and later to Gordon. Gordon biographers diminish or disregard that Ward creation, the Ever Victorious Army, an original and unique military development which made Gordon&#x27;s famed success in China possible. Today, Chinese Gordon is remembered, while Ward is largely forgotten. Some of Gordon&#x27;s fame is due to his dramatic death in Khartoum years after the Taiping Rebellion.

There have been several books on Ward and the Ever Victorious Army by Ward&#x27;s contemporaries and biographers published in the century since his death that seek to acknowledge Ward&#x27;s contributions. The bestseller, &quot;The Devil Soldier&quot; (1992), by novelist and military historian Caleb Carr, was optioned for a motion picture soon after publication. Actor Tom Cruise and director John Woo were developing a movie scripted by Carr, but the project was never completed.

===Physical remains and monuments===

There are just two U.S. memorials to Ward, both in Salem, Massachusetts: a headstone at an unfilled grave, and a collection of materials detailing his life and times by the Essex Institute. According to Caleb Carr, that &quot;Ward&#x27;s remains were dug up, and his grave site and shrine were destroyed and paved over. The whereabouts of Ward&#x27;s bones today are unknown. They have almost certainly been destroyed. A plain headstone over a cenotaph in Salem is the only memorial to this most noteworthy of nineteenth-century American adventurers&quot;.

Ward is also remembered in a Songjiang Roman Catholic Church, and in a Nanjing museum. One visitor wrote &quot;The grave of Ward, a Protestant, revered as a Chinese Confucian hero, with a temple in his honour, now lies under the altar of a Roman Catholic church [built in 1982], whilst the land itself is the property of the local Buddhist monastery in a Communist state… Ward has not been forgotten in Songjiang and local memory still has Ward&#x27;s bones under the high altar of the Catholic church&quot;. Ward&#x27;s accomplishments are documented in the Taiping Rebellion Museum in Nanjing. One visitor remarked &quot;To my surprise I saw, in a museum in Nanjing, a tribute to Ward — a large headstone bearing Ward&#x27;s name, put in place by the American Legion on May 29, 1923&quot;.

==In fiction==

Ward appears in &quot;Flashman and the Dragon&quot;, the eighth volume of George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s fictional Flashman Papers as a gun smuggler (apocryphal) and as the leader of the embryonic Ever Victorious Army.

Ward appears as Fletcher Thorson Wood in the novel &quot;Yang Shen&quot; by James Lande, which relates the tale of the first three years of the Ever Victorious Army, from its beginning as the Foreign Rifles in 1860 through September 1862.

<doc id="1218488" wikidata="Q511158" url="?curid=1218488" title="Gallus Anonymus">
<text>thumb|An artist&#x27;s impression of Gallus Anonymus&#x27; portrait by ], 1898.
Gallus Anonymus, also known by his Polonized variant Gall , is the name traditionally given to the anonymous author of (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in Latin between 1112 and 1118.
&quot;Gallus&quot; is generally regarded as the first historian to have described the history of Poland. His &quot;Chronicles&quot; are an obligatory text for university courses in Polish history. Very little is known of the author himself and it is widely believed that he was a foreigner.

== Kromer ==

The only source for &quot;Gallus&quot;&#x27; real name is a note made by Prince-Bishop of Warmia Marcin Kromer (1512–89) in the margin of folio 119 of the &quot;Heilsberg manuscript.&quot; It reads: &quot;Gallus hanc historiam scripsit, monachus, opinor, aliquis, ut ex proemiis coniicere licet qui Boleslai tertii tempore vixit&quot; (&quot;Gallus&quot; wrote this history, some monk, in my opinion, who lived in the time of Boleslaus III Wrymouth, as can be conjectured from the preface.&#x27;) It is not known whether Kromer intended the word &quot;Gallus&quot; as a proper name or as a reference to the author&#x27;s nationality (&quot;Gallus&quot; in this period normally means &quot;a Frenchman&quot;), nor what he based his identification on.

The Heilsberg manuscript, one of three extant witnesses of the &quot;Gesta&quot;, was written between 1469 and 1471. From the mid-16th to 18th centuries, it was kept in the town of Heilsberg (today Lidzbark Warmiński, Poland). It was later published at the behest of Prince-Bishop of Warmia Adam Stanisław Grabowski (1698–1766).

== Origin ==
The author of the &quot;Gesta&quot; wrote little about himself and was not written about in contemporary sources. What &quot;Gallus&quot; did write about himself may be summed up as follows: Before going to Poland, he likely spent some time in Hungary, where he met Polish duke Boleslaus III Wrymouth; he was a pilgrim; he revered Saint Giles; and he knew little about Scandinavia.

Historians agree that &quot;Gallus&quot;&#x27; writing style indicates a substantial education, available only to nobles and monks; and that he was an experienced writer, thus likely also to have authored earlier works. The &quot;clericus de penna vivens&quot; (&quot;cleric living by his pen&quot;) is suspected by Danuta Borawska and Marian Plezia to have earlier penned the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; (Deeds of the Hungarians) and the &quot;Translatio Sancti Nicolai&quot; (The Transfer of St. Nicholas); and his writing style is thought to have been influenced by recent literary developments that were then common only in northern France and the Netherlands.

Budapest&#x27;s Vajdahunyad Castle features an evocative bronze statue of a seated &quot;Anonymus&quot; in monk&#x27;s habit, the cowl obscuring his face.

&quot;Gallus&quot;&#x27; place of origin is unknown. Several theories have been advanced. Traditional scholarship has assumed that he was French (hence &quot;Gallus&quot;), perhaps from France or Flanders. Plezia has suggested that he was a monk from Saint Giles&#x27; Monastery in Provence, France.

Some scholars have pointed out that &quot;Gallus&quot;&#x27; writing style resembles that of Hildebert of Lavardin and have thought that &quot;Gallus&quot; had been educated at Le Mans or, according to Zathey, at Chartres or Bec in Normandy.

Before World War II, French historian Pierre David advanced a theory that Gallus might have been a Hungarian monk from Saint Giles&#x27; Monastery in Somogyvár who accompanied Boleslaus in his return from Hungary to Poland. This theory enjoys little support.

Another theory has been gaining ground in Poland. Professors Danuta Borawska and Tomasz Jasiński of Poznań University have presented a case for a Venetian origin. It has been argued that &quot;Gallus&quot; may have been a monk from St. Giles&#x27; Monastery at the Lido, Venice, Italy, and Professor Plezia has subsequently concurred.

The Venetian theory was first broached in 1904 by Polish historian Tadeusz Wojciechowski. In 1965 it was proposed again by Borawska but did not win acceptance. In recent years, however, it has been revisited and has now gained positive reviews from several Polish medievalists. It has been supported by Professors Janusz Bieniak, Roman Michałowski and Wojciech Fałkowski. Fałkowski has noted that the two theories—French and Italian—may be less mutually exclusive than some think, as &quot;Gallus&quot; might have been born in Italy, been a monk at the Lido, and have later traveled to France and Hungary.

According to Tomasz Jasiński, who in 2008 published a book on Gallus, the chronicler came to Poland over the Via Egnatia across the Slavic-speaking countries of &quot;Epirus, Thrace, Dalmatia, Croatia, Istria.&quot; When Jasiński compared the &quot;Chronicle&quot; with the &quot;Transfer of St. Nicholas&quot;, he found over 100 similarities. Jasiński has concluded that &quot;Gallus&quot;, like many Venetian clergymen of the time, had a native knowledge of both Italian and Slavic languages.

However, Paul W. Knoll and Frank Schaer regard the Venetian suggestion as &quot;too weak to be considered seriously.&quot; In Poland, medievalist Professor Jacek Banaszkiewicz supports a French over an Italian origin for &quot;Gallus Anonymus&quot;.

== Influence ==
The anonymous author of the &quot;Gesta&quot; influenced the subsequent course of Poland&#x27;s history, in that his version of early Polish history held the ruler&#x27;s authority to be inferior to that of God, a principle expressed by the voice of the people (as in the Latin proverb, &quot;Vox populi, vox Dei&quot;).

This concept reinforced Poles&#x27; electoral traditions and their tendency to disobey and question authority. Via the &quot;Chronicles&quot; of Wincenty Kadłubek and the &quot;Sermons&quot; of Stanisław of Skarbimierz, it contributed to the development of the unique &quot;Golden Liberty&quot; that would characterize the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, whose kings were elected and were obliged to obey the &quot;Sejm&quot; (parliament).

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Bushell VC DSO (31 October 1888 – 8 August 1918) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Bushell was 29 years old, and a temporary lieutenant colonel in the 7th (S) Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Royal West Surrey Regiment, British Army, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 23 March 1918 west of St. Quentin&#x27;s Canal and north of Tergnier, France, Lieutenant Colonel Bushell personally led C Company of his battalion, who were cooperating with an Allied regiment in a counterattack. In the course of this attack he was severely wounded in the head, but continued to carry on, walking in front of both British and Allied troops, encouraging them and visiting every portion of the lines in the face of terrific machine-gun and rifle fire. He refused to go to the rear until he had to be removed to the dressing station in a fainting condition.

He was killed in action to the south of Morlancourt, Somme, France, on 8 August 1918. He is buried at Querrieu CWGC, Somme, France.

In 1923, the Christopher Bushell Prize of books, for Modern History undergraduates, was established at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where Bushell read Modern History from 1906 to 1909.

<text>The Siemens Competition was a science competition for US high school students funded by the Siemens Foundation, which was administered by the College Board from 1999-2013 and by Discovery Education from 2014–2017. The Siemens Foundation released a statement on February 1, 2018 stating that the 2017 iteration of the competition was the final one.

== History ==

Siemens AG purchased Westinghouse Electric Corporation&#x27;s power generation unit in 1997, but sponsorship of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search (now the Regeneron Science Talent Search) was not part of the deal. When Siemens lost the bidding for the competition to Intel, Siemens decided to create the Siemens Foundation to continue the tradition using the well-known Westinghouse name, calling the new competition the Siemens Westinghouse Competition (SWC) and, later, the Siemens Competition. The first awards were given in 1999.

The competition had the same goals as the old Westinghouse Competition, but with several added dimensions, most notably awards for team projects and regional awards. The regional finals were held in cooperation with six partner universities: MIT, Georgia Tech, Caltech, University of Texas at Austin, University of Notre Dame, and Carnegie Mellon.

2007 was the first year that women won the top prizes in both the individual and team competitions at Siemens.
The individual winner was Isha Jain of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the top team winners were Janelle Schlossberger and Amanda Marinoff of Plainview, New York.

The Siemens Competition ran for 18 years. On February 1, 2018, the Siemens Foundation announced that the 2017 competition would be its last.

== Selection process ==

Each year, research reports submitted before a late-September to early-October deadline were subjected to a blind reading. 300 outstanding research reports, from more than 1600 entries, were selected as semifinalists. All semifinalists received a special recognition package, with their names announced in a full page USA Today advertisement. 
From the pool of semifinalists, 30 individuals and 30 teams (2–3 students) were selected as Regional Finalists and invited to compete during the month of November at one of the six partner universities (Caltech, UT Austin, Notre Dame, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Ga. Tech). In addition to project content, judging was also based on the oral presentation, poster display, cited references, and the question and answer session. All regional finalists received $1,000 scholarships and bronze medals. One individual and one team from each region advanced to the National Finals. These Regional winners received $3,000 (individual) or $6,000 (total for teams) scholarships, and silver medals.

The National Finalists (6 individual and 6 team projects) received an all-expense-paid trip during the first weekend of December to Washington, D.C. Winners of the Nationals received scholarships ranging from $10,000 to the coveted $100,000 grand prize for the top individual and top team.

==Background==
Butler was born in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, on 20 December 1888 to Lieutenant Colonel Francis John Paul Butler and the Hon. Elspeth Butler (née Gifford), daughter of Robert Gifford, 2nd Baron Gifford. Butler was thus the nephew of fellow Victoria Cross recipient Edric Gifford, 3rd Baron Gifford.

He was married, to Alice Amelia of Portfield, Chichester.

==Military career==
In February 1907, Butler was commissioned into the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. In October 1913 he was seconded for service under the Colonial Office, and attached to the Gold Coast Regiment.

Butler was a 25 year old lieutenant in The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, attached to Pioneer Company, Gold Coast Regiment, West African Frontier Force, when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 17 November 1914 in the Cameroons, Nigeria.

===Citation===
The following year he was promoted captain and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Posted to German East Africa with his Regiment, he was killed in action at Motomba on 5 September 1916 and is buried at Morogoro Cemetery in Tanzania.

==Medal==
His medal is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester.

<text>Thomas Byrne, VC (December 1866 Dublin – 15 March 1944) was an Irish British Army soldier. He was the recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Deed==
He was 31 years old, and a private in the 21st Lancers (Empress of India&#x27;s), British Army, during the reconquest of Sudan when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 2 September 1898 at the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, Private Byrne turned back in the middle of the charge of the 21st Lancers and went to the assistance of a lieutenant of the Royal Horse Guards who was wounded, dismounted, disarmed and being attacked by several Dervishes. Private Byrne already wounded, attacked these Dervishes, received a second severe wound and by his gallant conduct enabled the officer to escape.

Winston Churchill, an eye-witness, described it was the bravest act he had ever seen performed.

==Honours==
Byrne&#x27;s medal entitlement was:


* His Medals (including a replacement VC) were sold at Auction for £40,000 at David Lay Auctioneers in Penzance, Cornwall on 25 August 2015.

==Later life==
He later served in the Second Boer War and retired from the army in 1909 after serving with the Regimental Police. In retirement he lived in Canterbury, Kent. He rejoined the army in 1914 and served at the Cavalry Remount Depot, Canterbury, and in the Garrison Police. After the War, he was a messenger at the Cavalry Pay and Records Office.

<doc id="1218519" wikidata="Q2495699" url="?curid=1218519" title="Human rights in Turkey">
<text>Human rights in [[Turkey]] are protected by a variety of international law treaties, which take precedence over domestic legislation, according to Article 90 of the 1982 Constitution. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) was not signed by Turkey until 2000. As of today, however, Turkey is party to 16 out of 18 international human rights treaties of the United Nations.
The issue of human rights is of high importance for the negotiations with the European Union (EU).

In 2024, Freedom House rated Turkey&#x27;s human rights at 33 out of 100 (not free).

==Overview==
Acute human rights issues include in particular the status of Kurds in Turkey. The Kurdish–Turkish conflict has caused numerous human rights violations over the years. There is an ongoing debate in the country on the right to life, torture, freedom of expression as well as freedoms of religion, assembly and association.

In 2009, the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey released two reports detailing human rights abuses including torture, ill-treatment and isolation of small groups in prison. The reports documented 419 deaths in custody in a period of 15 years of military rule with 39 deaths recorded in prison in 2008 alone. Under the state of emergency powers, crackdown on the media freedom increased with several journalist arrested and held in prisons, media outlets shuttered or taken over by the state on the allegations of terrorism, “anti-state activities” and “denigrating Turkishness” or “insulting Islam”.

Turkey still keeps laws which are seen as undemocratic or authoritarian, such as prohibiting minorities to get a primary education in their mother tongue. The country&#x27;s largest minority, the Kurds, which comprise 15% of the population, have no right to self-determination even though Turkey has signed the ICCPR. In March 2017, the United Nations accused the Turkish government of &quot;massive destruction, killings and numerous other serious human rights violations&quot; against the ethnic Kurdish minority.

== Commitment to international human rights law ==
The Republic of Turkey has entered various human rights commitments, some of which are expressed in the 1982 Turkish Constitution, Part Two of which guarantees &quot;fundamental rights and freedoms&quot; such as the right to life, security of person, and right to property. In addition, Turkey has signed a number of treaties, shown in the tables below:



:*The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was signed in 1949.

:*The European Convention on Human Rights (1954) places Turkey under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). In 1987, Turkey accepted the right to apply individually to the ECtHR (Article 25 of the European Convention on Human Rights = ECHR) and 1990 recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 46 of the ECHR.

In October 2009 the European Commission on Enlargement to the European Union attested regarding Turkey that
On October 18, 2017, Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland called for the release of human rights activists detained in Turkey in a telephone call with Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül.

=== European Court of Human Rights judgments ===
Turkey&#x27;s human rights record has long continued to attract scrutiny, both internally and externally. According to the Foreign Ministry, Turkey was sentenced to 33 million euros in 567 different cases between 1990—when Turkey effectively allowed individual applications to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)—and 2006. Most abuses were done in the South-East, in the frame of the Kurdish–Turkish conflict.

In 2007, there were 2830 applications lodged against the Republic of Turkey before the ECtHR and consequently 331 judgments on the merits have been issued affirming 319 violations and 9 non-violations. In 2008, Turkey ranked second after Russia in the list of countries with the largest number of human rights violation cases open at the European Court of Human Rights, with 9,000 cases pending as of August 2008. In 2011, the ECtHR issued 159 judgments that found violations by Turkey, the most of any country, with Russia coming second at 121 judgments.

Between 1 November 1998 and 31 December 2008 the ECtHR received 24,945 applications from Turkey. It declared 2,237 cases admissible and 13,615 inadmissible. During the same time it reached 1,905 judgments finding at least one violation in 1,652 cases. While there are hardly any decision regarding Article 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ban of discrimination), many judgments concerning Article 2 (right to life) and Article 3 of the convention (ban of torture) were taken on procedural grounds rather than testifying an involvement of State agencies. According to the European Commission on Enlargement of the EU Turkey continued to make progress on the execution of ECtHR judgments. All pecuniary compensation was paid on time, totalling €5.2 million in 2008.

The ECtHR has heard nine cases against Turkey concerning political party bans by the Constitutional Court of Turkey. In all but one case (which concerned the Islamist Welfare Party), the European Court has ruled against the decision to ban, finding Turkey in violation of articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention (freedom of expression and freedom of association). The ECtHR&#x27;s decision concerning the Welfare Party has been criticized for lack of consistency with its other decisions, in particular by Human Rights Watch.

One ECtHR judgment sentenced Turkey to a 103,000 euros fine for its decisions about the Yüksekova Gang (aka &quot;the gang with uniforms&quot;), related to the JİTEM clandestine gendarmerie intelligence unit. The EHCR also sentenced in 2006 Turkey to a 28,500 Euros fine for the JİTEM murder of 72-year-old Kurdish writer Musa Anter, in 1992 in Diyarbakir. Other cases include the 2000 Akkoç v. Turkey judgment, concerning the assassination of a trade-unionist; or the Loizidou v. Turkey case in 1996, which set a precedent in the Cyprus dispute, as the ECtHR ordered Turkey to give financial compensation to a person expelled from the Turkish-controlled side of Cyprus.

The ECtHR also awarded in 2005 Kurdish deputy Leyla Zana €9000 from the Turkish government, ruling Turkey had violated her rights of free expression. Zana, who had been recognized as prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International and had been awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had been jailed in 1994, allegedly for being a member of the outlawed PKK, but officiously for having spoken Kurdish in public during her parliamentary oath.

==The right to live==
The right to live may be threatened by other means than the death penalty. In particular during the 1990s there were many instances of extrajudicial executions, (political) killings by unidentified perpetrators (&quot;faili meçhul cinayetler&quot;) and cases of &quot;disappearances&quot;.

===Capital punishment===

The death penalty has not been implemented in Turkey since 1984. Turkey abolished the sentence for peace time offences in 2002 and for all offences in 2004. The sentence was replaced by aggravated life imprisonment (&quot;ağırlaştırılmış müebbet hapis cezası&quot;). According to Article 9 of Law 5275 on the Execution of Sentences these prisoners are held in individual cells in high security prisons and are allowed to exercise in a neighbouring yard one hour per day. They have more limited access to activities and they are not allowed to work.

===Extrajudicial executions===
In 1990 Amnesty International published its first report on extrajudicial executions in Turkey. In the following years the problem became more serious. The Human Rights Foundation of Turkey determined the following figures on extrajudicial executions in Turkey for the years 1991 to 2001:
In 2001 the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Ms. Asma Jahangir, presented a report on a visit to Turkey. The report presented details of killings of prisoners (26 September 1999, 10 prisoners killed in a prison in Ankara; 19 December 2000, an operation in 20 prisons launched throughout Turkey resulted in the death of 30 inmates and two gendarmes).

For the years 2000–2008 the Human Rights Association (HRA) gives the following figures on doubtful deaths/deaths in
custody/extra judicial execution/torture by paid village guards
In 2008 the human rights organization Mazlum Der counted 25 extrajudicial killings in Turkey.

===Unsolved killings===
The mass violations of human rights in the mainly Kurdish-populated southeast and eastern regions of Turkey in the 1990s took the form of enforced disappearances and killings by unknown perpetrators which the state authorities showed no willingness to solve. In 2009 the Human Rights Association stated that up to the end of 2008 a total of 2,949 people had been killed by unknown perpetrators and 2,308 people had become victims of extrajudicial executions.

A parliamentary commission to research killings by unknown perpetrators (&quot;faili meçhul cinayetleri araştırma komisyonu&quot;) was founded in 1993 and worked for about two years. Many members complained that they had not been assisted and their work had been undermined. One member of the commission, Eyüp Aşık, stated that the Turkish Hezbollah had been behind many of these killings and added that the State had had three effective arms in the fight against terrorism: special teams, village guards and Hezbollah. Although he had witnessed about 80 actions of Hezbollah in Adıyaman province the then Minister for the Interior had said that there was nothing by that name. This in turn had made him believe that the State supported Hezbollah.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) first called for an investigation of links between Hezbollah and the security forces in 1992. In a separate report HRW stated:
Based on the data of the Interior Ministry, the daily &quot;Zaman&quot; reported that between 1987 and 2001 a total of 2,914 political killings, 1,334 of them in the responsibility area of the police and 1,580 in area of the gendarmerie, were committed in the Eastern and Southern Eastern Anatolia Regions. 457 of the killings in areas of the police and 1,291 in areas of the gendarmerie had not been clarified.

The following figures were presented in the annual reports of the HRFT between 1990 and 2001
The Human Rights Association (HRA) presents the following figures for the years 1999 to 2008:

The Human Rights Association Mazlumder presented figures on killing by unknown assailants and suspicious death for the years 2005 to 2008:

===&quot;Disappearances&quot;===

In Turkey, the military campaign against Kurdish secessionists in Eastern Anatolia has been accompanied by numerous enforced disappearances, which also gave rise to judgments of the European Court of Human Rights to murder. There were only a handful of cases of &quot;disappearances&quot; in Turkey in the 1980s, but a high number of deaths in custody. The opposite was true for the 1990s, when the number of people who &quot;disappeared&quot; after having been abducted by agents of the States increased.

In 1998 the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances issued a Report on the visit to Turkey by two members of the Working Group from 20 to 26 September 1998. It stated &quot;inter alia&quot;:

In her report of 18 December 2001 the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Ms. Asma Jahangir, wrote: While the number of cases of abductions or &quot;disappearances&quot; have decreased over the last few years, at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#x27;s visit such incidents still did occur, particularly in the remote areas of south-east Turkey, and there was deep concern at the recent disappearance of two persons.

In some places on the Internet a list attributed to the HRA can be found (but not on the website of the HRA). It is said that the original list contained 839 names, but that adding further names the list covered 1,251 names in the end. In a revised list that covers only the time between 1980 and 1999 Helmut Oberdiek reached a figure of 818 cases of &quot;disappearances&quot; in Turkey.

The &quot;Saturday Mothers&quot; held weekly protests against &quot;disappearances&quot; between May 1995 and 1999. They had to suspend their action on 13 March 1999 after week 200, because of intense pressure, detention and ill-treatment. In March 2009 the Saturday Mothers took their action up again.

==Torture==

The widespread and systematic use of torture in Turkey was first observed by Amnesty International (AI) after the 1971 Turkish coup d&#x27;état. Until 2002 the organization continued to speak of systematic torture in Turkey. Günter Verheugen, Commissioner for Enlargement of the European Union went to Turkey in September 2004 and maintained that torture was no longer systematic practice in Turkey. The Human Rights Association (HRA) protested against this evaluation and pointed at recent figures and definitions of systematic torture by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee against Torture.

Since 2005 incidents of torture seem to be on the rise. According to an October report by the Prime Ministry&#x27;s Human Rights Presidency (HRP), the number of torture and cruel treatment cases reported in the first six months of the year surpassed the number reported in the first half of 2007. The HRP reported that, in the first half of the year, 178 persons reported cruel treatment and 26 reported torture, up from 79 reports of cruel treatment and 17 reports of torture during the same period in 2007. In the report on progress of November 2008 the European Commission stated, &quot;the number of applications to NGOs in relation to cases of torture and ill-treatment has increased, in particular outside official places of detention, notably during apprehension, transfer, or in the open with no detention registered... There is a lack of prompt, impartial and independent investigation into allegations of human rights violations by members of security forces.&quot; In the 2009 annual report Amnesty International stated: &quot;Reports of torture and other ill-treatment rose during 2008, especially outside official places of detention but also in police stations and prisons.&quot;
In its 2012 Annual Review, Freedom from Torture the UK charity which works with survivors of victims of torture, stated that the charity had received 79 referrals of individuals from Turkey for clinical treatment and other services.

===Deaths in custody===
An important characteristic of the period following the 12 September 1980 military intervention was the disregard to the right to life and the increase in torture cases and deaths due to torture. The HRFT published two reports on Deaths in Custody (14 and 15 years since the military take over) presenting a list of 419 deaths in custody (in 15 years) with a suspicion that torture might have been the reason. Another 15 deaths were attributed to hunger strikes while medical neglect was given as the reason for 26 deaths. On the basis of this list Helmut Oberdiek compiled a revised list for 20 years (12 September 1980 to 12 September 2000) and concluded that in 428 cases torture may have been the reason for the death of prisoners. In 2008 alone the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey reported of 39 deaths in prison. In some cases torture was involved. In 2012, two prison guards and an official were given life sentences for the torture death of activist Engin Çeber, the first such verdict in Turkey&#x27;s history.

=== Poor living conditions in Turkish prisons ===
Turkey has repeatedly been criticized for allowing poor living conditions to exist in its prisons and in particular, it has been criticized for not doing anything to solve the problem of overcrowded prisons. Following the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état political prisoners tried in military courts were held in military prisons and were thus subjected to military discipline. Prisoners were obliged to participate in daily roll-calls, the singing of marches and drills in the open air. In particular, Diyarbakır and Mamak Military Prisons (the latter in Ankara) became notorious for the routine beatings which accompanied attempts to enforce military discipline among civilians. In addition, so-called &quot;inaugural-beatings&quot; had been institutionalized in almost all prisons in Turkey.

In 2008, allegations of ill-treatment in prisons and allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners during their transfers continued to be made. Small-group isolation remained a problem across the prison system for people who were accused or convicted of politically motivated offences. The Human Rights Foundation of Turkey registered 39 deaths in prison.

In March 2020, following the publication of reports which documented the life-threatening living conditions which existed in prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Turkey published a draft of a document in which it stated that it was preparing to release 100,000 inmates. However, Amnesty International and several other human rights organizations stated that they were still concerned about journalist and human rights defenders, who as per the government&#x27;s perceived policies, will remain behind bars.

==Freedom of religion==
Turkey identifies a secular country, as detailed by Article 24 of the Turkish Constitution. Islam is the predominant religion, with the two main sects being Sunni and Alevi. In Turkey Alevi are the minority, estimated at 17 percent of the Muslim population.

Religious education is compulsory in primary and secondary education (Article 24 of the Constitution). Mainly Sunni theology is taught. The government oversees Muslim religious facilities and education through its Directorate of Religious Affairs, which is under the authority of the Prime Ministry. The Directory regulates the operation of the country&#x27;s 77,777 registered mosques and employs local and provincial imams, who are civil servants. Sunni imams are nominated and paid by the state. The Alevis pray in &quot;cemevis&quot;. &quot;Cemevleri&quot; (places of gathering) have no legal status as places of worship in the state. However, Kuşadası and Tunceli municipalities ruled in 2008 that Alevi &quot;cemevleri&quot; are considered places of worship.

Exact figures on the non-Islamic population in Turkey are not available. Some sources estimate the Christian population between three and five percent. Their communities mainly exist in Istanbul with Armenian and Greek-Orthodox Christians; in southeastern Turkey other groups like the Syriacs and Yazidi (a syncretistic faith) can be found. In the big cities Jewish and other communities such as the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses exist. According to the Treaty of Lausanne only the Armenian, Greek and Jewish communities are recognized as minorities.

According to the human rights organization Mazlumder, the military charged individuals with lack of discipline for activities that included performing Muslim prayers or being married to women who wore headscarves. In December 2008 the General Staff issued 24 dismissals, five of which pertained to alleged Islamic fundamentalism.

In 2022, Freedom House rated Turkey&#x27;s religious freedom as 2 out of 4, noting that apart from Sunni Islam, Judaism, Orthodox Christianity and Armenian Christianity are officially recognized, but there are regular disputes regarding property and training of clerics.

==Freedom of expression==
Article 26 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. Articles 27 and 28 of the Constitution guarantee the &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;unhindered dissemination of thought&quot;. Paragraph 2 of Article 27 affirms that &quot;the right to disseminate shall not be exercised for the purpose of changing the provisions of Articles 1, 2 and 3 of [the] Constitution&quot;, articles in question referring to the unitary, secular, democratic and republican nature of the state.

Law 765 (the old penal code) that entered into force on 1 March 1926 restricted freedom of expression, despite several amendments. Law 5237 that replaced the old penal code on 1 June 2005 preserved several provisions that restrict freedom of thought and expression. A number of special laws such as the Law 5816 (offences against the memory of Atatürk), Press Law and the Law on Political Parties also restrict freedom of expression.

In the 1970s and 1980s the Articles 141 (membership of communist organizations), 142 (communist or separatist propaganda) and 163 (membership of or propaganda for anti-secular organizations) of Law 765 (the Turkish Penal Code, TPC) were most frequently used to punish peaceful opposition. On 12 April 1991 Law 3713 on the &quot;Fight against Terrorism&quot; (or Anti-Terror Law, ATL) entered into force. It abolished these provisions, but retained part of Article 142 TPC in Article 8 ATL. Journalists, politicians, human rights defenders and trade unionists were convicted under this provision, often simply for having used the word &quot;Kurdistan&quot;.

After the European Court of Human Rights had passed more than 100 judgments finding a violation of Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights some changes were made to existing legislation. Article 8 of the ATL was abolished by Law 4928 of 30 July 2003. Another frequently used Article 312/2 of the TPC (incitement to hatred and enmity) was amended by Law 4744 of 9 February 2002. The new version narrowed the use of this Article by introducing the condition &quot;if the incitement might endanger public order&quot;. The new wording (and sentences) for such an &quot;offence&quot; are now contained in Article 216 of Law 5237. The sentence that mere criticism should not be punishable under Article 159 of Law 765 (denigrating Turkishness, the Republic or the Grand National Assembly of Turkey) was added to the law text, although this had already been established in the case law. The &quot;offence&quot; is now described in Article 301 of Law 5237.

After severe criticism from NGOs and European institutions Article 301 was once again amended on 30 April 2008. The amendments introduced a requirement for permission to be obtained from the Justice Minister in order to launch a criminal investigation. 
Human Rights Watch reported on July 26, 2017, that over the past year, hundreds of outlets have been shuttered or taken over under state of emergency powers. More than 160 journalists and media workers are now in prison or pretrial detention, according to Turkish media watchdog NGO P24. They include 10 of the Cumhuriyet staff currently on trial.

Following the adoption of the amendments to Article 301, Turkish courts had forwarded, by September 2008, 257 cases to the Minister of Justice for prior authorisation. The Minister had reviewed 163 cases and refused to grant permission to proceed in 126 cases. The Minister of Justice authorised the criminal investigations to continue in 37 cases. This included one case which was initiated following a statement made by a Turkish writer on the Armenian issue shortly after the assassination of the Turkish journalist of Armenian origin, Hrant Dink.

Other legal provisions that restrict freedom of expression include Articles 215, 216 and 217 of the Turkish Criminal Code, that criminalise offences against public order, and the Anti-Terror Law have been applied to prosecute and convict those expressing non-violent opinions on Kurdish issues.

The use of the Turkish alphabet is mandated by law, reflecting the historic transition from an Arabic to a Latin script.

According to the Human Rights Watch 2019 report, Turkey has the maximum number of jailed journalists. In February 2018, prominent journalists Ahmet Altan, Mehmet Altan and Nazlı Ilıcak were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on the couped charges.

On 3 July 2020, in a high-profile trial, a Turkish court sentenced the honorary chair of Amnesty International Turkey, Taner Kilic, to six years and three months in jail, accusing him for being a member of terror organization. The organization&#x27;s former director İdil Eser was also sentenced to two years and one month, along with members Günal Kursun and Özlem Dalgiran, on same charges. The human rights group denied all the charges. Human rights organizations claimed that holding individuals charged with terrorism offenses in prolonged pre-trial detention continued to be widely used in Turkey and raised concerns regarding it becoming a form of summary punishment.

On 21 February 2022, the Human Rights Watch reported that Öztürk Türkdoğan, co-chair of the Human Rights Association (Turkey), was prosecuted for his legitimate human rights work. Ankara prosecutors prepared three indictments against Türkdoğan in a single month for speeches and statements that do not advocate violence. On March 19, 2021, police briefly detained Türkdoğan from his home and confiscating his laptop and phone. He was later released with a travel ban imposed on him.

On 25 June 2022, the Amnesty International reported that Turkish authorities detained the head of the Human Rights Association, Öztürk Türkdoğan, prominent human rights lawyer, Eren Keskin, and several relatives of victims of enforced disappearances from the Saturday Mothers/People 900th vigil. The authorities also prevented a peaceful vigil by human rights defenders demonstrating on behalf of people who have been forcibly disappeared in Turkey.

On 14 October 2022, the OHCHR expressed concern over the adoption by Turkiye&#x27;s Parliament of a package of amendments to various laws “that risk curtailing freedom of expression” in the country. One of the amendments was a revision of the criminal code that establishes sentences of up to three years in prison for “publicly disseminating false information” on digital platforms. Under international human rights law, freedom of expression is not limited to ‘truthful’ information, but applies to ‘information and ideas of all kinds&#x27;.

On 26 October 2022, Turkish authorities arrested and detained the head of Turkey&#x27;s medical association, Şebnem Korur Fincancı. Her arrest was linked to a statement she made in the press on the occasion of a conference she gave in Germany on 19 October 2022, about allegations of the use of chemical weapon by Turkey in Kurdistan regional federation of Iraq.

===Freedom of the media===
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the AKP government has waged one of the world&#x27;s biggest crackdowns on media freedom. Many journalists have been arrested using charges of &quot;terrorism&quot; and &quot;anti-state activities&quot; such as the Ergenekon and Balyoz cases, while thousands have been investigated on charges such as &quot;denigrating Turkishness&quot; or &quot;insulting Islam&quot; in an effort to sow self-censorship. In 2017, the CPJ identified 81 jailed journalists in Turkey (including the editorial staff of &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot;, Turkey&#x27;s oldest newspaper still in circulation), all directly held for their published work (ranking first in the world in 2017, with more journalists in prison than in Iran, Eritrea or China); while in 2015 Freemuse identified nine musicians imprisoned for their work (ranking third in that year after Russia and China). In 2015 Turkey&#x27;s media was rated as &quot;not free&quot; by Freedom House. In its resolution &quot;The functioning of democratic institutions in Turkey&quot; on 22 June 2016, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe warned that &quot;recent developments in Turkey pertaining to freedom of the media and of expression, erosion of the rule of law and the human rights violations in relation to anti-terrorism security operations in south-east Turkey have (...) raised serious questions about the functioning of its democratic institutions.&quot;

On 29 April 2017, Turkish authorities blocked online access to Wikipedia in all languages across Turkey. The restrictions were imposed in the context of the purges that followed the coup attempt, a few weeks after a significant constitutional referendum, and following more selective partial blocking of Wikipedia content in previous years. Following the ban, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia&#x27;s founder, was disinvited from the World Cities Expo in Istanbul from 15 to 18 May. Turkish law professor Yaman Akdeniz estimated that Wikipedia was one of about 127,000 websites blocked by Turkish authorities. An estimated 45 percent of Turks have circumvented the Internet blocks, at one time or another, by using a virtual private network (VPN). On 15 January 2020 access started being progressively restored, after the Constitutional Court ruled that the ban violated freedom of expression, 991 days after the block had started.

===2016 coup crackdown===
After the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared a state of emergency and began an ideological purge of government and civil society. The government blamed its former ally the Gülen movement for the coup, and had declared it a terrorist organization in late 2015. The purge was criticized internationally, including by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra&#x27;ad Al Hussein and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who also condemned the coup attempt. Critics said the Turkish government was using terrorist affiliation as a pretense to suppress dissent and punish political opponents of Erdoğan generally.

The government has alleged affiliation with the Gülen movement or with the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (also listed as a terrorist organization) as a reason for firings and arrests. The purge has resulted in the dismissal of tens of thousands of government employees, including thousands of police and teachers. Arrests have included thousands of members of the military; about a third of the judges in the country; Kurdish activists, mayors, governors, and members of parliament, especially those affiliated with the HDP (which opposed the coup); and journalists. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs. Various television stations, radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses were shut down, and tens of thousands of passports were revoked. A lot of international media attention and international diplomatic negotiations followed the arrest of ten Human Right&#x27;s defenders in July 2017, and they became known internationally as the Istanbul 10. Wikipedia was blocked in Turkey between April 2017 and January 2020.

===Conscientious objection===
There is currently no provision for conscientious objection. Article 72 of the Turkish Constitution states: &quot;National service is the right and duty of every Turk. The manner in which this service shall be performed, or considered as performed, either in the Armed Forces or in public service, shall be regulated by law.&quot; This in principle would allow for a non-military alternative. Turkey, Belarus and Azerbaijan are the only European countries that have not introduced any legislation on conscientious objection.

In January 2006, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey had violated Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights that prohibits degrading treatment in a case relating to Osman Murat Ulke, the first conscientious objector to be imprisoned for his objection. Another conscientious objector, Mehmet Tarhan, was sentenced to four years in prison by a military court in 2005 for refusing to do his military service, but he was later released in March 2006. However, he is still a convict and shall be arrested on sight.In a related case, journalist Perihan Mağden was tried and acquitted by a Turkish court for supporting Tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right.

Since 1989, 74 people have refused to perform compulsory military service in Turkey. Only six of them have been tried for being a conscientious objector or sent to the military unit they were assigned to after being captured. COs may be punished under Article 63 of the Turkish Military Penal Code for avoiding military service. COs who attract media attention or publish articles about their refusal to perform military service may also be punished to between six months’ and two years&#x27; imprisonment under Article 318 of the Turkish Criminal Code for &quot;alienating the people from the armed forces&quot;. In 2004, a new Criminal Code was introduced (Law No 5237). Under the previous Criminal Code, &quot;alienating people from the armed forces&quot; was punishable under Article 155 with a similar term of imprisonment.

Some members of religious denominations who forbid their members to bear arms, in particular Jehovah’s Witnesses, have also refused to perform military service. Members of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have regularly been sentenced to imprisonment under Article 63 of the Penal Code for avoiding military service. For many years, conscientious objectors who are Jehovah’s Witnesses have faced repeated military call-ups, prosecutions, burdensome fines, and imprisonment. Since 2011, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has issued three judgments in favor of the Witnesses, and in 2012, the UN Human Rights Committee released a favorable decision on this issue. However, Türkiye continues to prosecute young Witness men who refuse military service. 

Muhammed Serdar Delice, a young Muslim, declared his conscientious objection to military service in 2011 and argued that his objection was based on his Muslim faith. After serving a few months in the Armed Forces he claimed that he had experienced disrespectful interference with his religious practice, as well as indoctrination about Turkey&#x27;s three-decade-old war with Kurdish insurgents. Most Kurds are fellow Muslims.

Further instances of imprisonment included
* Halil Savda: He was sentenced to 21.5 months imprisonment
* Mehmet Bal: He was repeatedly imprisoned in 2002, 2003 and 2008. He was allegedly beaten in prison.

The Council of Europe and the United Nations have regularly called upon Turkey to legally recognise the right to conscientious objection. In March 2004, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe stated that: &quot;Despite Turkey&#x27;s geostrategic position, the Assembly demands that Turkey recognises the right to conscientious objection and introduce an alternative civilian service.&quot; In September 2009 the Turkish press reported that the Turkish government is considering creating regulations regarding conscientious objectors. According to the amendment planned on the issue, those refusing to perform compulsory military service will no longer be forcibly drafted to the military while they are under detention and will be able to be defended by a lawyer while being tried. They will also be able to benefit from the Probation Law.

=== Quotes on free opinion in Turkey ===
* Amnesty International: &quot;Human rights defenders, writers, journalists and others were unjustly prosecuted under unfair laws and subjected to arbitrary decisions by judges and prosecutors. Courts also acted disproportionately when shutting down websites on the basis of posted items. People expressing dissenting views remained at risk, with individuals threatened with violence by unknown individuals or groups. Police bodyguards were provided in a number of cases.&quot;
* Human Rights Watch: &quot;Critical and open debate increased, even as restrictions on free speech continue.&quot;
* US Department of State: &quot;The government limited freedom of expression through the use of constitutional restrictions and numerous laws, including articles of the penal code prohibiting insults to the government, the state, the &quot;Turkish nation,&quot; or the institution and symbols of the republic. Limitations on freedom of expression applied to the Internet, and courts and an independent board ordered telecommunications providers to block access to Web sites on approximately 1,475 occasions.&quot;
* European Union: &quot;There has been some progress in the efforts to strengthen the safeguards for freedom of expression, which is a priority of the Accession Partnership. However, only a consistent track record of implementation will show whether or not the revised article is adequate.&quot;

==Freedom of assembly==
Article 34 of the 1982 Constitute (as amended on October 17, 2001) states, &quot;Everyone has the right to hold unarmed and peaceful meetings and demonstration marches without prior permission.&quot; Restrictions may only be introduced on the grounds of national security, and public order, or prevention of crime commitment, public health and public morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Article 3 of Law 2911 on demonstrations and meeting provides, &quot;Everybody has the right to hold unarmed and peaceful assembly without prior permission.&quot; Nevertheless, Amnesty International stated in 2009 that the right to freedom of peaceful assembly was denied, and law enforcement officials used excessive force to disperse demonstrations.

Deaths due to excessive police force during demonstrations have a long history in Turkey. They include
* Taksim Square massacre of 1 May 1977, death toll varies between 34 and 42
* Further casualties on 1 May Labour Day (all in Istanbul):
** 1989: 1 person killed
** 1996: 3 demonstrators killed.
* Newroz celebrations; usually on or around 21 March each year
** Newroz 1991: 31 people shot dead The annual report of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT) reported that one demonstrator was killed in Nusaybin.
** Newroz 1992: The Newroz festivities left at least 91 people dead in three towns of the southeast, Cizre, Şırnak and Nusaybin, and 9 others elsewhere in the region, and according to Helsinki Watch, &#x27;all or nearly all of the casualties resulted from unprovoked, unnecessary and unjustified attacks by Turkish security forces against peaceful Kurdish civilian demonstrators&#x27;.
** Newroz 1993: Three people were killed in Adana and Batman.
* Different occasions
** Funeral of Vedat Aydin in Diyarbakir in June 1991, 15 people were shot dead The annual report of the HRFT reported that seven demonstrators were killed.
** During a demonstration in Digor because of the 9th anniversary of the beginning of the armed fight of the PKK on 15 August 1984. 15 demonstrators were killed.
** 20 people died in Gazi and 1 May quarter of Istanbul during an unrest that started with shots on coffee shop frequented by Alevis.
** Funeral of PKK militants at the end of March 2006: 13 people were killed in Diyarbakir and further places

In July 2017 Turkey arrested in the eve of the G20 summit in Hamburg from ‘digital security and information management workshop’ 12 persons. They included Idil Eser, head of Amnesty International Turkey, Peter Steudtner, a hotel owner and a Swedish and German trainee. Activists detained included Ilknur Üstün of the Women&#x27;s Coalition, lawyer Günal Kursun and Veli Acu of the Human Rights Agenda Association.

==Freedom of association==

The law provides for freedom of association. Under the law persons organizing an association do not need to notify authorities beforehand, but an association must provide notification before interacting with international organizations or receiving financial support from abroad, and must provide detailed documents on such activities.

The Constitution affirms the right of workers to form labor unions &quot;without obtaining permission&quot; and &quot;to possess the right to become a member of a union and to freely withdraw from membership&quot; (Article 51). Articles 53 and 54 affirm the right of workers to bargain collectively and to strike, respectively.

Until March 2008 a total of 26 political parties had been banned, two of them before the Constitutional Court (the place where such decisions are taken) was established on 25 April 1962. This figure does not include the 18 political parties that were banned immediately after the 1980 coup d&#x27;état and dissolved on 16 October 1981. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey passed Law 2533 on 19 June 1992 allowing these parties to be opened again.

The Foundation for social, economic and political research (TESAV) has detailed information on the closure of political parties. They list ten political parties (instead of two) that were closed before the Constitutional Court was established. The details are (in collapsible tables)

==Ethnic rights==

Though Turkey is a land of vast ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity – home not only to Turks, Kurds and Armenians, but also, among others, Alevis, Ezidis, Assyrians, Laz, Caferis, Roma, Greeks, Caucasians and Jews, the history of the state is one of severe repression of minorities in the name of nationalism.

According to Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution, &quot;everyone bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a Turk&quot;. The Constitution affirms the principle of the indivisibility of the Turkish Nation, Nation State and of constitutional citizenship that is not based on ethnicity. Consequently, the word &quot;Turkish&quot; legally refers to all citizens of Turkey, though individual interpretation can be more limited. According to the constitution, there are no minority rights since all citizens are Turks. This constitutional article ignores the basic ethnic and religious minority rights. Although the Treaty of Lausanne, before the proclamation of the Republic, guarantees some rights to non-Muslim minorities, in practise Turkey has recognised only Armenians, Greeks and Jews as minorities and excluded other non-Muslim groups, such as Assyrians and Yazidis, from the minority status and these rights. Advocacy for protection of minorities&#x27; rights can lead to legal prosecutions as a number of provisions in Turkish law prohibits creation of minorities or alleging existence of minorities, such as Article 81 of the Law on Political Parties.

===Kurdish people===
Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, some Kurdish tribes, which were still feudal (manorial) communities led by chieftains (&quot;agha&quot;), became discontent about certain aspects of Atatürk&#x27;s reforms aiming to modernise the country, such as secularism (the Sheikh Said rebellion, 1925) and land reform (the Dersim rebellion, 1937–1938), and staged armed revolts that were put down with military operations.

The Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States, the European Union and NATO) was founded in 1978 by a group of Kurdish militants led by Abdullah Öcalan, seeking the foundation of an independent, Marxist–Leninist state in the region, which was to be known as Kurdistan. A full-scale insurgency began in 1984, when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising. Since the conflict began, more than 40,000 people have died, most of whom were Turkish Kurds. Following the arrest and imprisonment of Abdullah Öcalan in 1999, the PKK modified its demands into equal rights for ethnic Kurds and provincial autonomy within Turkey.

Due to the large population of Kurdish people, successive governments have viewed the expression of a Kurdish identity as a potential threat to Turkish unity, a feeling that has been compounded since the armed rebellion initiated by the PKK in 1984. One of the main accusations of cultural assimilation comes from the state&#x27;s historic suppression of the Kurdish language. Kurdish publications created throughout the 1960s and 1970s were shut down under various legal pretexts. Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited from government institutions. The letters W, X or Q present in the uncorroborated Kurdish alphabet is not recognized.

Between 1959 and 2011, the European Court of Human Rights has condemned Turkey for the thousands of human rights abuses against Kurdish people. Many judgments are related to cases such as civilian deaths in aerial bombardments, torturing, forced displacements, destroyed villages, arbitrary arrests, murdered and disappeared Kurdish journalists, activists and politicians.

Since 2002, as part of its reforms aimed at European Union integration and under pressure to further the rights of Kurds, Turkey passed laws allowing Kurdish radio and television broadcasts as well the option of private Kurdish education. In 2010 a master level and in 2011 a graduate level university program were started and a Kurdish Language and Literature Department was established in the state-owned Mardin Artuklu University.

In August 2009, Turkish government has restored the Kurdish name of one Kurdish village, and was considering allowing religious sermons to be made in Kurdish in rural villages as part of reforms to answer the grievances of the ethnic minority and advance its EU candidacy.
More than 4,000 Kurds were arrested in 2011, including dozens of journalists and politicians. Mass trials of local deputies, mayors, academics and human rights activists have occurred in Diyarbakir. Hundreds of Kurds remain in pre-trial detention, some of them for many months.

In January 2013, the Turkish parliament passed a law that permits use of the Kurdish language in the courts, albeit with restrictions. The law was passed by votes of the ruling AKP and the pro-Kurdish rights opposition party BDP, against criticism from the secularist CHP party and the nationalist MHP, with MHP and CHP deputies nearly coming to blows with BDP deputies over the law. In spite of their support in the parliament, the BDP was critical of the provision in the law that the defendants will pay for the translation fees and that the law applies only to spoken defense in court but not to a written defense or the pre-trial investigation. According to one source the law does not comply with EU standards. Deputy prime minister of Turkey Bekir Bozdağ replied to criticism of the law from both sides saying that the fees of defendants who does not speak Turkish will be paid by the state, while, those who speak Turkish yet prefer to speak in the court in another language will have to pay the fees themselves. European Commissioner for Enlargement Stefan Füle welcomed the new law.

In February 2013, Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said during a meeting with Muslim opinion leaders, that he has &quot;positive views&quot; about imams delivering sermons in Turkish, Kurdish or Arabic, according to the most widely spoken language among the mosque attendees. This move received support from Kurdish politicians and human rights groups.

===Minority languages===
Despite the improvement of minorities language rights in Turkey, the only language of instruction in the education system is Turkish language. Minority languages are illegal to use as a main languages in the education. Minorities are allowed to study their languages only as a minor subject in private and public educational institutions.
Until reforms that started in 2002, there were legal restrictions on publishing in minority languages except for Greek, Armenian and Hebrew which are the languages of minorities officially recognized by the Lausanne Treaty. Since September 2002, those minorities, too, have the right to operate private courses that teach any language spoken in Turkey. Some of the Kurdish courses were closed down by their owners in 2005 due to their limitations and a lack of interest. However, as of 2010, there were active Kurdish language minor subject courses with increasing number of students. In 2010, state-owned Mardin Artuklu University started a master-level Kurdish language and literature (&quot;Kurdology&quot;)program. Dicle University, another Turkish state university in Diyarbakır, started to give Kurdish courses in June 2011. In September 2011, the first undergraduate level Kurdish Language and Literature Department in Turkey was opened in the Mardin Artuklu University. According to the deputy rector of the university, this was not only the first university department on this subject in Turkey, but also the first one of the whole world.

NGOs have called on Turkey to adopt the definitions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. If Turkey were to become a signatory to this treaty, it would have to accept and subsidise the education of minorities in their own first languages, and that for at least all the period of mandatory education. To this day 21 member states of the Council of Europe out of 49 have proceeded with ratification.

The state-owned TRT has been broadcasting short programmes in a number of minority languages, including Bosnian, Arabic, Kabardian and Kurdish, since July 2003. The legal basis were the Regulation on the Language of Radio and Television Broadcasts of December 2002 In the beginning TV programs were restricted to 45 minutes per day; radio programs had a limit of 60 minutes per day. In June 2006 the restrictions were lifted for music and film programs in minority languages.

In the 21st century some reforms have taken place to improve the cultural rights of ethnic minorities in Turkey, such as the establishment of TRT Kurdî, TRT Arabi and TRT Avaz by the TRT.

==Other discrimination==
===Women===
In the 1930s, Turkey became one of the first countries in the world to give full political rights to women, including the right to elect and be elected locally (in 1930) and nationwide (in 1934). Therefore, the Constitution was amended.

Article 10 of the Turkish Constitution bans any discrimination, state or private, on the grounds of sex. Turkey elected a female prime minister, Tansu Çiller in 1995. It is also the first country which had a woman, Tülay Tuğcu, as the President of its Constitutional Court. In addition, Turkish Council of State, the supreme court for administrative cases, also has a woman judge Sumru Çörtoğlu as its president. However, representation of women in political and decision-making bodies is low. In the Grand National Assembly of Turkey the percentage of women is 9.1 (17.3 percent is the average in the world). In 1975 the percentage was 10.9 and in 2006 it was 16.3. Only 5.58 percent of mayors are women and in the whole of Turkey there is one governor (among 81) and 14 local governors.

Since 1985, Turkish women have the right to freely exercise abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and the right to contraceptive medicine paid for by the Social Security. Modifications to the Civil Code in 1926 gave the right to women to initiate and obtain a divorce; a right still not recognized in Malta, an EU country.

Nevertheless, in Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions, older attitudes prevail among the local Kurdish, Turkish and Arab populations, where women still face domestic violence, forced marriages, and so-called honor killings. To combat this, the government and various other foundations are engaged in education campaigns in Southeastern Anatolia to improve the rate of literacy and education levels of women.

In 2008, critics have pointed out that Turkey has become a major market for foreign women who are coaxed and forcibly brought to the country by international mafia to work as sex slaves, especially in big and touristic cities.

A 2008 poll by the Women Entrepreneurs Association of Turkey showed that almost half of urban Turkish women believe economic independence for women is unnecessary reflecting, in the view of psychologist Leyla Navaro, a heritage of patriarchy.

===Children===
Child labor is a minor yet still occurring issue in Turkey. Despite the Government&#x27;s moderate advancement in eliminating child labor and its worst forms, children continue to engage in agricultural activities for the most part.
In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 2.6% (corresponding to around 320,000 children) of children aged 5 to 14 work, and that 57% of them are found in the agricultural sector, 15% in the industrial sector and 27% in services.
Even though these children&#x27;s work remains seasonal, the fact that child labor still occurs is partly due to the fact that agricultural enterprises with a very limited workforce are not subject to Government law.
In December 2014, the Department&#x27;s &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&quot; reported 8 goods produced exclusively by child labor in Turkey. The majority of these products are agricultural goods including cotton, cumin, hazelnuts, peanuts, pulses and sugar beets.

In March 2021, a report published by the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey claimed that more than 3,000 students have suffered from rights violations during protests and demonstrations in turkey between 2015 and 2019.

===Sexuality===

Homosexual sexual relationships between consenting adults in private are not a crime in Turkey. The age of consent for both heterosexual and homosexual sex is eighteen. On the other hand, the criminal code has vaguely worded prohibitions on &quot;public exhibitionism&quot; and &quot;offenses against public morality&quot; that are sometimes used to discriminate against the LGBT community. As of 2006, Turkey neither has a law permitting homosexuals to get married, nor does it have a law against the discrimination of Turkey&#x27;s LGBT community. Lambda Istanbul, an LGBT organization founded in 1996, was dissolved in May 2008 following a court decision. The prosecution argued that its objectives went against &quot;the law and morality&quot;, but Human Rights Watch has criticized the decision, claiming it had been closed only on procedural grounds. On 28 November 2008, the Supreme Court of Appeals overturned an Istanbul court&#x27;s decision ordering the closure of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender solidarity organization, Lambda Istanbul.

Homosexuals have the right to exemption from military service, if they so request, only if their &quot;condition&quot; is verified by medical and psychological tests, which often involves presenting humiliating, graphic proof of homosexuality, and anal examination.

Discrimination against LGBT people in Turkey is widespread. According to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center, 78% of Turkish respondents believe that homosexuality is not accepted by society.

The killing of Ebru Soykan, a prominent transgender human rights activist, on March 10, 2009, &quot;shows a continuing climate of violence based on gender identity that authorities should urgently take steps to combat,&quot; Human Rights Watch said on 13 March 2009. News reports and members of a Turkish human rights group said that an assailant stabbed and killed Ebru, 28, in her home in the center of Istanbul. Members of Lambda Istanbul, which works for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and transsexual (LGBTT) people, told Human Rights Watch that in the last month Ebru had asked the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office for protection from the man who had beaten her on several occasions and threatened to kill her. Lambda Istanbul was told that a few weeks ago police detained the man but released him two hours later. The same man is under police custody as the murder suspect.

On 21 May 2008 Human Rights Watch published a 123-page report documenting a long and continuing history of violence and abuse based on sexual orientation and gender identity in Turkey. Human Rights Watch conducted more than 70 interviews over a three-year period, documenting how gay men and transgender people face beatings, robberies, police harassment, and the threat of murder. The interviews also exposed the physical and psychological violence lesbian and bisexual women and girls confront within their families. Human Rights Watch found that, in most cases, the response by the authorities is inadequate if not nonexistent.

===Disabled citizens===
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was signed by the Turkish Republic on 30 March 2007. The convention was discussed in TBMM (Turkish Grand National Assembly) on 8 May 2008 and it was ratified on 3 December 2008. In July 2005 Law 5378 on Disabled People was enacted.

In one particular case, an advocacy group for people with mental disabilities called Mental Disability Rights International criticized the treatment of the mentally ill in a report called &quot;Behind Closed Doors: Human Rights Abuses in the Psychiatric Facilities, Orphanages and Rehabilitation Centers of Turkey&quot;. As a result of this criticism, Turkey&#x27;s largest psychiatric hospital, the Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital in Istanbul, abolished the use of &quot;unmodified&quot; ECT procedures.

===Racism===

Analysts pointed (in 2010) to racism and hate speech on the rise in Turkey, including against Armenians and against Jews. The report says &quot;If one goes through the press in Turkey, one would easily find cases of racism and hate speech, particularly in response to the deplorable carnage and suffering in Gaza. These are the cases in which there is no longer a distinction between criticizing and condemning Israel&#x27;s acts and placing Jews on the firing line.&quot;

===Religious===
Mistreatment of religious minorities is a common problem in Turkey and is sometimes sanctioned by the state&#x27;s leadership. Christians for example live in fear of persecution and suffer from discriminatory laws that give non-Muslims disadvantages in comparison to the country&#x27;s Muslim majority.

Among the discriminated religious minorities in Turkey are the Alevis, whose &quot;Muslimness&quot; is still unconfirmed. As a result of national and government policy, their religious rights are also restricted and at many instances are a persecuted religious minority.

====Hate crimes====

During 2008 there has been an increase in &quot;hate crimes&quot; in Turkey originating from racism, nationalism and intolerance. Despite provisions in the Constitution and the laws there have been no convictions for a hate crime so far, from either racism or discrimination. Since the beginning of 2006 a number of killings were committed in Turkey against people of ethnic or religious minorities or different sexual orientation or social sexual identity. Article 216 of the Turkish Penal Code provides for a general ban of publicly inciting people to hatred and disgust.

Turkey does not appear to be the scene of large-scale or overt expressions of racism against individuals in the strictest sense of term. However, one of the main challenges facing Turkey in the field of European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong sense of national identity and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their own sense of ethnic identity, for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects of that identity.

==Internally displaced people==

Around a million people became displaced from towns and villages in south-eastern Turkey during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of the insurgent actions of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the counter-insurgency policies of the Turkish government.

The Migrants’ Association for Social Cooperation and Culture (GÖÇ-DER) was founded in Istanbul in 1997. Branches were later established in Diyarbakir, Van and Hakkari. GÖÇ-DER has been sued five times for its activities. Four of them ended in acquittal. One case demanding the closure of GÖÇ-DER Diyarbakir is still pending after the Court of Cassation cancelled the decision of Diyarbakir Judicial Court No. 1 not to band the association. This court has to hear the case again and scheduled the next hearing for 2 February 2010.

In July 2008 Beşir Atalay, Minister of the Interior, answered a request by the CHP deputy of Adıyaman, Şevket Köse. He said that 314,000 people had applied for aid in order to return to their village. As of May 2008 151,469 people had returned to their villages in 14 provinces. They had been paid about 530 million Turkish Lira.

On 12 April 2006, Human Rights Watch researcher Jonathan Sugden was detained by police in Bingöl, while he was carrying out research in the predominantly Kurdish southeast of the country into the possibilities for IDPs to return and abuses allegedly involving the Turkish gendarmerie and government-armed local defense units called &quot;village guards.&quot; He was deported to London the next day.

==Workers&#x27; rights==
The Constitution affirms the right of workers to form labor unions &quot;without obtaining permission&quot; and &quot;to possess the right to become a member of a union and to freely withdraw from membership&quot; (Article 51). Articles 53 and 54 affirm the right of workers to bargain collectively and to strike, respectively. The law prohibits strikes by civil servants, public workers engaged in the safeguarding of life and property, workers in the coal mining and petroleum industries, sanitation services, national defense, banking, and education; however, many workers in these sectors conducted strikes in violation of these restrictions with general impunity. The law requires that, in order to become a bargaining agent, a union must represent 50 percent plus one of the employees at a given work site and 10 percent of all the workers in that particular industry. Labor law prohibits union leaders from becoming officers of or otherwise performing duties for political parties and from working for or being involved in the operation of any profit-making enterprise Most labor experts in the country estimated that approximately 20 percent of the wage and salary workers in the labor force were unionized.

The Labor Act of 2003 established a 45-hour workweek, banned discrimination based on sex, religion, or political affiliation, and entitlement to compensation in case of termination without valid cause. It also mandated that working hours per day cannot exceed 11 hours.

Turkey has had a standard state-run pensions system based on European models since the 1930s. Furthermore, since 1999, Turkey has a state-run unemployment insurance system, introduced by Law 4447 obligatory for all declared workers.

==Extraterritorial beatings==
In May 2017, bodyguards of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attacked Kurdish rights protesters outside the Turkish embassy in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="1218539" wikidata="Q530787" url="?curid=1218539" title="Sydney Parkinson">
<text>Sydney Parkinson ( 1745 – 26 January 1771) was a Scottish botanical illustrator and natural history artist. He was the first European artist to visit Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti. Parkinson was the first Quaker to visit New Zealand. 

== Early life and family ==
Parkinson was born in Edinburgh; his parents were the Edinburgh brewer Joel Parkinson, a Quaker, and his wife Elizabeth. His birth year is usually given as , but is somewhat suspect as his mother was born . He had a brother, Stanfield, and a sister, whose name was Britannia. The parents were members of the Edinburgh meeting of Quakers; John Fothergill was another member. Parkinson&#x27;s father died in 1749, leaving the family in financial difficulties. Parkinson became apprentice of a woollen draper. According to his brother, he took &quot;a particular delight in drawing flowers, fruits and other objects of natural history&quot;, becoming &quot;so great a proficient in that stile of painting, as to attract the notice of the most celebrated botanists.&quot; While no direct evidence exists that Parkinson received formal training in art, he has been connected to William Delacour, who taught drawing and design at the Trustees&#x27; Academy, and may have been influenced by other Edinburgh artists.

== London ==

The family moved to London , where Parkinson&#x27;s brother Stanfield worked as an upholsterer. In 1765 and 1766, some of Parkinson&#x27;s flower paintings and drawings were shown at Free Society of Artists exhibitions. Parkinson began to give drawing lessons, and the Scottish nurseryman James Lee, a fellow Quaker, employed him as teacher to his daughter Ann. Lee introduced Parkinson to Joseph Banks in 1767. Through Banks, Parkinson also established contact with the zoologist Thomas Pennant. Parkinson produced copies of some animal paintings in the collection of Joan Gideon Loten, which were later published in some of Pennant&#x27;s zoological books. His watercolours of birds of the Loten collection were painted in 1767, either from specimens or from drawings. Together with a fellow artist, Peter Paillou, Parkinson worked for Banks on the latter&#x27;s collections from his 1766 voyage to Newfoundland and Labrador. He produced drawings and watercolour paintings of animals, from specimens preserved in alcohol or stuffed birds. When Banks planned a voyage to Sweden in order to meet Linnaeus in Uppsala and to see Lapland, he intended to take Parkinson as his draughtsman.

== Voyage with Captain Cook ==

Parkinson was employed by Joseph Banks to travel with him on James Cook&#x27;s first voyage to the Pacific in 1768, in HMS Endeavour. Parkinson made nearly a thousand drawings of plants and animals collected by Banks and Daniel Solander on the voyage. He had to work in difficult conditions, living and working in a small cabin surrounded by hundreds of specimens. In Tahiti, he was plagued by swarms of flies which ate the paint as he worked. He died at sea on the way to Cape Town of dysentery contracted at Princes&#x27; Island off the western end of Java. Banks paid his outstanding salary to his brother.

Before his travels, Parkinson had taught illustration to Ann Lee, daughter of James Lee a Hammersmith nurseryman for whom he had made illustrations. In his will Parkinson left &quot;whatever utensils that are useful in painting or drawing to Mr. Lee’s daughter, my scholar.&quot;

== Journal ==
Parkinson kept a journal on board the ship until shortly before his death in January 1771. While the fair copy of the journal was lost and never found, Stanfield Parkinson obtained some of his brother&#x27;s papers from Banks in 1773, and decided to publish them earlier than John Hawkesworth&#x27;s official publication of Cook&#x27;s and Banks&#x27;s journals. A legal injunction obtained by Hawkesworth prevented the publication until two days after his book had appeared on 10 June 1773.

== Legacy ==
Parkinson is commemorated in the common and scientific name of the Parkinson&#x27;s petrel &quot;Procellaria parkinsoni&quot;. The great Florilegium of his work was finally published in 1988 by Alecto Historical Editions in 35 volumes and has since been digitized by the Natural History Museum in London.

In 1986, he was honoured on a postage stamp depicting his portrait issued by Australia Post.

<doc id="1218546" wikidata="Q6231208" url="?curid=1218546" title="John Edmondson (soldier)">
<text>John Hurst Edmondson, VC (8 October 1914 – 14 April 1941) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
John Hurst Edmondson was born at Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. His parents moved to the Sydney suburb of Liverpool where he attended Austral Public School and Hurlstone Agricultural High School. He later became a farm worker.

==Second World War==
On 20 May 1940 Edmondson enlisted in the 2/17th Battalion after serving with the 4th Militia Battalion since March 1939. He was promoted to corporal. After training at Ingleburn and Bathurst, his battalion embarked for the Middle East on 19 October 1940 as reinforcements for the 9th Division. After desert training, his division relieved the 6th Australian Division at Marsa Brega in Cyrenaica on 9 March 1941. On 31 March, the German forces under the command of General Erwin Rommel mounted an attack on the Australian and British positions, forcing them to retreat. The 9th Division took up new positions outside the port of Tobruk and on 11 April, the now famous siege began.

===Victoria Cross citation===
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 1 July 1941, reading:
An hour later, 200 German infantrymen attacked the post, forcing the Australians to withdraw, and established a bridgehead in the outer defensive line. However, the fierceness of the platoon&#x27;s defence pressured Rommel into diverting troops from his main attack. The attack failed, with the German tanks being mauled and forced to retreat with heavy casualties.

Corporal John Edmondson died of his wounds and is buried in the Tobruk war cemetery. He was the first Australian to receive the Victoria Cross in the war. Edmondson&#x27;s VC was presented to his mother by the Governor-General on 27 September 1941. In 1969, she presented her son&#x27;s medals and some of his personal belongings to the Australian War Memorial, where they still are on display.

==Legacy==

His name is still honoured by: the John Edmondson VC Rest Area at Roses Lagoon on the Remembrance Driveway from Sydney to Canberra; John Edmondson VC Memorial RSL Club, Liverpool, NSW; a plaque in the Walk of Honour in Baylis Street, in his birthplace of Wagga Wagga, NSW; the school hall in his former school, Hurlstone Agricultural High School, is named after him; a high school in the Horningsea Park district in NSW is named after him; the Sydney suburb of Edmondson Park, and Edmondson Street in the Sydney suburb of North Ryde, are named in his honour. Edmondson St in Campbell situated in Canberra, within 400m of the War Memorial is also named in his honour. Freemasons&#x27; Lodge Victoria Cross No. 928 of the United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory (UGLNSWACT) which meets in Fairfield, NSW, was formed in honour of Cpl J H Edmondson, who was posted to Holsworthy Army Barracks, and who was an attending member of Liverpool Lodge. The Edmondson VC Club at ARTC Kapooka, an outer suburb of Wagga Wagga, is also named in his honour.

<text>David Ross Lauder VC (31 January 1894 – 4 June 1972) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Lauder was 21 years old, and a private in the 1/4th Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 August 1915 at Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey, Private Lauder was with a bombing party retaking a sap when he threw a bomb which failed to clear the parapet and fell amongst the bombing party. There was no time to smother the bomb and Private Lauder at once put his foot on it, thereby localizing the explosion. His foot was blown off, but the remainder of the party escaped unhurt.

<text>A drovers&#x27; road, drove road, droveway, or simply a drove, is a route for droving livestock on foot from one place to another, such as to market or between summer and winter pasture (see transhumance). Many drovers&#x27; roads were ancient routes of unknown age; others are known to date back to medieval or more recent times.

==Description==
Drovers&#x27; roads are often wider than other roads, able to accommodate large herds or flocks. Packhorse ways were quite narrow as the horses moved in single file, whereas drove roads were at least and up to wide. In the United Kingdom, where many original drovers&#x27; roads have been converted into single carriageway metalled roads, unusually wide verges often give an indication of the road&#x27;s origin. In Wales, the start of many droveways, drovers&#x27; roads are often recognisable by being deeply set into the countryside, with high earth walls or hedges. The most characteristic feature of these roads is the occasional sharp turn in the road, which provided cover for animals and men in severe rain or snow. Some drovers&#x27; roads crossed mountains.

It is likely that the so-called &quot;Roman Steps&quot; in the Rhinogydd in Wales is an example of a drove road.

== Drovers ==

&quot;Drovers&quot; (those droving or driving livestock) accompanied their livestock either on foot or on horseback, travelling substantial distances. Rural England, Wales and Scotland are crossed by numerous drove roads that were used for this trade, many of which are now no more than tracks, and some lost altogether. The word &quot;drover&quot; (porthmon in Welsh) is used for those engaged in long distance tradedistances which could cover much of the length of Britain or other world regions where droving was usedwhile &quot;cattle driver&quot; was used for those taking cattle to local markets.

Drovers used dogs to help control the stock, and these would sometimes be sent home alone after a drove, retracing their outward route and being fed at inns or farms the drove had &#x27;stanced&#x27; at; the drover would pay for their food on his next journey.

A newspaper reported that the dogs mostly used in London for droving to the outlying butcheries and depots were principally collies, but in this show were a few of the old English bob-tailed animals seldom seen in London except on show, and not so often seen in the country as was the case thirty or forty years ago.

Controlling herds of three or four hundred animals on narrow roads, keeping them healthy, and feeding them &quot;en route&quot; over several weeks or months required expertise and authority. There was licensing under legislation introduced in 1563 intended to control &quot;badgers&quot; of grain and drovers of cattle, although it seems to have been less rigorously applied to drovers.

Drovers&#x27; dogs were also licensed. 

They were also exempted from the Disarming Acts of 1716 and 1748, which were passed after Jacobite risings. They were not necessarily literate but were respected as experts in their trade.

== Early history ==
Some form of drovers&#x27; roads existed in Romano-British times and certainly throughout the Early Middle Ages. For example, the old east-west drovers&#x27; road connecting the Dorset/Exeter region with London and thence Suffolk is along a similar alignment to the Roman road of the same route. Many lengths of the Welsh Road through the English Midlands coincide with manorial or parish boundaries, suggesting that it predates them and probably had pre-Roman origins as an ancient trackway.

==Medieval drovers&#x27; roads==
In Great Britain, &quot;Drove&quot; as a placename can be traced to the early 13th century, and there are records of cattle driven from Wales to London and sheep from Lincolnshire to York in the early 14th century. Drovers from Scotland were licensed in 1359 to drive stock through England. These may be simply the earliest records of a more ancient trade. There is increasing evidence for large-scale cattle-rearing in Bronze Age and Iron Age Britain. Cattle and sheep were part of the Romano-British economy. By the Anglo-Saxon period there was long distance movement of cattle, including stolen stock.

What is certain is that during the medieval period there was a substantial trade in cattle out of Wales into England, to which cattle from Ireland were added. These were driven across Somerset, Wiltshire and Berkshire to feed the growing population of London. The drovers made use of ancient ridgeways, including the Ridgeway over the Berkshire Downs, and ridgeways still known as the Old Shaftesbury Drove and the Ox Drove leading from Shaftesbury and Blandford to Salisbury.

Medieval drovers&#x27; roads were wide by medieval standards, 20 metres across, with wide grazing verges on either side, the &quot;long acre&quot;.

In medieval Spain the existence of migratory flocks on the largest scale, which were carefully organised through the system of the &quot;Mesta&quot;, gave rise to orderly drovers&#x27; roads, called &quot;cabañeras&quot; in Aragon, &quot;carreradas&quot; in Catalonia, &quot;azadores reales&quot;, emphasising royal patronage, in Valencia, and most famous of all, &quot;cañadas&quot;, including three major &quot;cañadas reales&quot;, in Castile. Along these grazing trackways, sheep travelled for distances of 350 to 450 miles (560 to 725 km), to the summer pasturages of the north, around León, Soria, Cuenca and Segovia, from the middle of April, and returning to winter pasturage in La Mancha, Extremadura, Alcántara and the lowlands of Andalusia.

In Languedoc the transhumance pathways, more restricted by agriculture and orchards and less organized than those of Iberia, were the &quot;drailles&quot; that fed into the main &quot;carraïres&quot;, which led from coastal plains to summer mountain pastures. They are documented from the 13th century and were organised in the 16th century by &quot;Statuts de la transhumance&quot;. In some areas, such as on Mont Lozère, the &quot;drailles&quot; were marked by &quot;montjoies&quot; (standing stones).

In the Kingdom of Naples, patterns of transhumance established in Late Antiquity were codified by Frederick II Hohenstaufen, but the arrival of rulers of Aragon in the 15th century saw the organisation of sheepways, &quot;tratturi delle pecore&quot; on the Aragonese model, and pastoralists were given privileges and restrictions, collectively termed the &quot;dogana&quot;, that were reminiscent of those of the &quot;Mesta&quot;. This established drovers&#x27; roads that continued without substantial change into the age of the railway.

== 17th century onwards ==
By the 17th century Daniel Defoe described Smithfield, in London, as the greatest meat market in the world. In 1855 it was moved to the outskirts of the city, to a site known as the Caledonian Market on Caledonian Road, Islington, to avoid the problems of large numbers of stock being driven through the streets. Cattle were also driven to other major cities, to areas of intermediate grazing to be fattened for market, and to markets and fairs. Many of the greatest stock fairs, such as Tan Hill, Yarnbury and White Sheet in Wiltshire, were held on ancient sites to which cattle were driven for centuries, perhaps since prehistoric times.

Geese, turkeys, pigs, and horses and in some cases goats were also driven to markets. Large quantities were driven to London. Cattle were shod with iron shoes; geese could be driven through a pan of tar mixed with sawdust, grit or ground shells or fitted with pads to protect their feet. The feet of turkeys could be tarred and sanded. Daniel Defoe recorded that 150,000 turkeys were driven from East Anglia to London each year, the journey taking three months to complete. There is reported to be a record of a wager in 1740 on whether geese or turkeys would travel fasterthe winner being the geese which could graze as they moved, while the turkeys had to stop to be fed.

Repeatedly, regulations were put in place to try to control outbreaks of cattle disease and these included the drovers&#x27; activities. Penalties of £50 or more could be imposed.
During one disease outbreak, drovers were no longer able to take their dogs into Ireland.
The regularity of the Welsh trade across Wiltshire is proved by an inscription in Welsh on an old inn (now a private house) in Stockbridge, still visible in the twentieth century: &quot;Gwair tymherus porfa flasus&quot; (worthwhile grass and a pleasant pasture) and &quot;Cwrw da cwal cysurus&quot; (good beer and a comfortable shelter).

Much of the trade in cattle from Wales to London was done on letters of credit. In 1706 the law was changed specifically to prevent drovers escaping their debts by declaring themselves bankrupt. The trade promoted the development of banking systems in both London and Wales. David Jones, a farmer&#x27;s son, came into contact with the drovers whilst employed at the King&#x27;s Head in Llandovery and set up his own Black Ox Bank in Llandovery in 1799; the bank issued its own bank notes. The bank survived until 1909 when it was taken over by Lloyds Bank.

==Long acre==

The &quot;long acre&quot; is a traditional term for wide grassy road verges. In some places, such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of the British Isles, rural roads are often separated from adjoining paddocks and fields by both a hedge or fence and a wide grass verge. Rather than leaving this verge fallow, farmers often tether livestock on it to use pasture feed (in the form of the grass) that would otherwise be wasted. Historically, the long acre was also grazed by herds or flocks moving from place to place, either on long journeys, or from one small local field to another. The long acre provided an important resource for such flocks and herds, perhaps forming a significant part of a small farmer&#x27;s pasture. In Australia, the most common method of keeping grazing stock off a road is by the use of a portable electric fence, visible to the stock and to passing travellers as a single white tape. The use of the long acre as pasture has sometimes become formalised. For example, in parts of England, some have been registered as common land. In some cases the herbage of the drove was rented out to local farmers for grazing.

The related term &quot;long paddock&quot; is occasionally encountered in Australia with the same meaning, although the term also has a more specific historical meaning, relating to the cross-country droving of cattle between Queensland and New South Wales along what is now the route of the Cobb Highway.

==Drover&#x27;s House==
Whilst drovers often slept in the open, there were pubs that catered for the needs of drovers and their stock. One such was the Tydd Gote Inn, advertised as a Drover&#x27;s House.
==Decline of droving==

Droving declined during the nineteenth century, through a combination of agricultural change, the introduction of railway transport from the 1840s, cattle disease, and more intensive use of the countryside through which the stock had passed for hundreds of years. For example, importation of cattle from Donaghadee in Ireland to Portpatrick, which would then be driven through Wigtownshire, had reached 20,000 per year in 1812, but fell to 1,080 in 1832, because they came by steamer directly to ports at Liverpool and Glasgow instead.

As the use of driveways declined and rights of way and responsibility for maintenance were disputed, evidence of usage by drivers could be given in court, as happened in Wisbech St Mary, Isle of Ely in 1843.

Drovers&#x27; rights to occupy a stance and pasture their cattle was also being challenged.
The last recorded large-scale cattle drove across Wales was in 1870, and of sheep in 1900, although droving was briefly resumed during the rail strike of 1912. In Scotland, the last drove over the Corrieyairack Pass is believed to have taken place in 1906. Corrieyairack Pass had also been used by droves of cattle and sheep from the Isle of Skye; the last drove from Skye to use the pass occurred &quot;in the closing years of the 19th century&quot;.

An example of regular annual sheep droving is described as taking place &quot;a short time before the [First World] war&quot; in England between Dorset and Hertfordshire.

When cattle were moved by rail by the North-East railway company, initially the drovers accompanied the stock on the goods train; later, they were required to use the passenger trains.

Despite the decline in droving, the annual Drovers&#x27; Tea in Norwich in 1906 organised by the RSPCA catered for 570.

Drovers and other road users could come into conflict. In 1916 a new order compelled farmers and drovers of cattle, sheep, et cetera, to carry lamps at the front and rear of herds or flocks, such lamps &quot;to be visible for a reasonable distance&quot;, and swung to and fro on the approach of any vehicle to indicate the presence of an obstruction on the road.

== North America and South America ==

Cattle drives in North America by American cowboys and South American cattle drivers are similar in nature, although distances were often greater; like most routes they started out by following a general geographic route before becoming roadways. They were a major economic activity in the 19th and early 20th century. Particularly common in the western states, such as Texas, Kansas, Louisiana. The peak period for cattle driving was between 1850s and 1910s. In this period, about 27 million cattle were moved during that time. The riders covered long distances. Both riders and stock animals were in need of rest, this resulted in formation of &quot;cow towns&quot; across the frontier. The first of them were Abilene, Wichita and Dodge City.

<text>Sinitta Malone known mononymously as Sinitta, is a British-American singer. She initially found commercial success in the mid-1980s with the single &quot;So Macho&quot; and had several other hits during the decade. In the 2000s, she became known for television appearances, including &quot;Loose Women&quot;, &quot;The Xtra Factor&quot; and &quot;This Morning&quot;. She took part in the ITV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2011.

== Early life ==
She was born in Seattle, Washington. Sinitta&#x27;s mother is Miquel Brown, who was a popular Canadian disco-soul singer in the 1970s and 1980s and a member of the cast of &quot;Hair&quot;. Sinitta&#x27;s father&#x27;s name is Anthony.

She has a sister, Gretta, who was adopted by a relative. Sinitta was born and raised in Seattle and later Detroit, but frequently travelled with her mother on tour including to Sydney. Her mother then directed the London production of &quot;Hair&quot;; Sinitta was sent to boarding school in East Sussex, and ballet school in Tunbridge Wells from the age of 9. She auditioned for musical roles in London, performing in &quot;The Wiz&quot; at age 12 while still in school.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
In 1981, Sinitta appeared in the film &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; as Frankie, credited as Sinitta Renet. Sinitta continued her career by appearing in several West End productions, notably the first production of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Cats&quot;. She also later appeared in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. In 1983, she appeared in the video for Forrest&#x27;s version of The Hues Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;.

=== 1986–1988: &quot;Sinitta!&quot; and &quot;So Macho&quot; ===
In 1986, Sinitta released the single &quot;So Macho&quot;, which debuted at 59 on the UK charts; the single remained rather low in the charts but, later that year, reached number 16, climbing to number 5 the following week. The subsequent week, &quot;So Macho&quot; reached number 2 in the UK, scoring its highest position on the charts and also giving Sinitta her first Top 3 charting single. &quot;So Macho&quot; spent the following six weeks in the Top 20 in the UK. Alongside this success in the UK, &quot;So Macho&quot; also reached the Top 20 in Sweden, Australia and Austria. &quot;So Macho&quot; subsequently became the highest-charting of Sinitta&#x27;s career to date. Sinitta&#x27;s second single &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot; was less commercially successful, charting at number 45.

In 1987, Sinitta released the lead single from her upcoming debut album, after seeking the help of producers Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW). The product of that collaboration, &quot;Toy Boy&quot;, was based on a tabloid headline about Sinitta&#x27;s love life, and featured a rap written by the singer. It debuted at number 41 and climbed to number 4 in the UK, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. The single remained in the Top 20 for eight weeks. The track also reached number 3 in Switzerland, reaching the Top 20 in Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Germany. Sinitta then released the second single from the album, &quot;GTO&quot;; the single reached number 15 on the UK chart.

&quot;GTO&quot; also became Sinitta&#x27;s first hit in Spain, reaching number 3. The track reached number 11 in Switzerland, number 9 in Norway and number 13 in Ireland. The success of the track came despite the singer initially expressing her dissatisfaction with the subject matter of the song when first presented with the idea by record label boss, Simon Cowell. Fearing that the title would mean nothing to her core audience of gay men and younger record buyers, Sinitta had unsuccessfully begged producers Stock Aitken Waterman to retitle the track before recording. Sinitta later released her debut album &quot;Sinitta!&quot;, which performed moderately, charting at number 34 in the UK. This album also reached number 69 in Australia.

In 1988, Sinitta released &quot;Cross My Broken Heart&quot;, taken from &quot;Sinitta!&quot;, which reached number 6 in the UK and number 7 in Ireland. The track charted at number 12 in Spain, becoming her second Top 20 single in Spain. Sinitta then released &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe In Miracles&quot;, which reached number 22 in the UK.

=== 1989–1990: &quot;Wicked&quot; and &quot;Right Back Where We Started From&quot; ===
In 1989, Sinitta moved away from working directly with producers Stock Aitken Waterman amid creatives differences and the producers&#x27; changing priorities following the rise of their in-house superstar Kylie Minogue. However, Sinitta did continue to work with Pete Hammond, Phil Harding and Ian Curnow with PWL, in co-operation with German producer Ralf-René Maué who was responsible for such hits of the Hamburg-based eurodisco duo London Boys as &quot;Harlem Desire&quot;, &quot;Requiem&quot; and &quot;London Nights&quot;. The second album was confirmed as &quot;Wicked&quot;. The lead single of the album was a cover of Maxine Nightingale&#x27;s &quot;Right Back Where We Started From&quot;, which debuted at number 19 in the UK and rose to number 6. The following week the track climbed to number 4 in the UK, holding this position for the subsequent week.

For the subsequent four weeks, the single remained in the Top 40. It also charted across the rest of Europe, including reaching number 7 in Finland and the Top 40 in Denmark, Spain and Germany. &quot;Right Back Where We Started From&quot; also charted successfully in Oceania, reaching number 7 in Australia and number 2 in New Zealand, thus becoming her highest charting single in both countries. In addition to this success, the track made the year-end charts, at number 45 in Australia, number 38 in New Zealand and number 49 in the UK. As a follow-up single, Sinitta released &quot;Love on a Mountain Top&quot;, which charted at number 20 in the UK and number 81 in Australia.

The final single of the album, however, was the least successful out of the three, failing to chart. In 1990, Sinitta released the single &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot;, which performed moderately, charting at number 20 in the UK, whilst &quot;Love and Affection&quot; peaked at number 62.

=== 1992–1997: &quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot; and &quot;Naughty Naughty&quot; ===
In July 1992, &quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot; debuted at number 31 in the UK, and later peaked at number 28.

The following April, Sinitta released the 4 track EP &quot;The Supreme&quot;, containing covers of 4 songs originally by The Supremes which charted at number 49 in the UK. In 1995, Sinitta released a covers album called &quot;Naughty Naughty&quot;, which was also the only album of hers to be released in Asia.

She appeared on the cast recording album for &quot;What a Feeling&quot;, a live recording taken from the Apollo Playhouse Theatre, Edinburgh, in May 1997, and replaced Irene Cara to tour with Sonia (a fellow former SAW artist) and Luke Goss (formerly of Bros) in the rock and pop musicals concert, &quot;What a Feeling&quot; the same year.

In 1997, Sinitta recorded vocals for a cover of the Limmie &amp; Family Cookin&#x27; hit &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken, believing it to be her comeback single. However, the track was in fact an elaborate stunt by TV show &quot;The Cook Report&quot;, which aimed to expose alleged chart rigging by attempting to hype the track into the charts. The record was fronted by reporter Debbie Currie, who pretended to sing to Sinitta&#x27;s vocal. Sinitta only discovered this when the show was aired, leaving her feeling used and betrayed.

=== 2004–2023: The &quot;X Factor&quot; era, television and judging ===
In 2004, Sinitta made her premiere appearance on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the first series, when she assisted Simon Cowell at the Judges&#x27; Houses stage, helping to select his final three acts for the live show, choosing Verity Keays, Rowetta Satchell and the eventual series winner Steve Brookstein. In 2005, Sinitta helped Cowell once more during the second series, this time choosing the final four groups Addictiv Ladies, 4Tune, The Conway Sisters and Journey South. In 2006, she returned in the third series and helped Cowell select his final four acts including Ashley McKenzie, Nikitta Angus, Ray Quinn and Leona Lewis, who became the second winner chosen by them, with Lewis becoming one of the most successful acts from the show. In 2009, Sinitta returned to the show again during the sixth series for the Judges&#x27; Houses stage, and then helped Cowell select Jamie Archer, Danyl Johnson and Olly Murs. In 2007, Sinitta became a judge on the ITV show &quot;Grease Is the Word&quot;.

The following year, Sinitta joined the cast of the daytime ITV show &quot;Loose Women&quot; as a presenter. In 2010, Sinitta returned to The X Factor for series 7 and helped Cowell again by choosing F.Y.D, Belle Amie and One Direction who have since become the biggest act to have come out of the &quot;X Factor&quot;. In 2011, however, Sinitta assisted Louis Walsh for the first time, rather than Cowell, when she returned in series 8, selecting Jonjo Kerr, Sami Brookes, Johnny Robinson and Kitty Brucknell. In November that year, Sinitta was confirmed to be taking part in the eleventh series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!&quot; as one of the contestants and she entered the jungle on Day 3.

In 2013, Sinitta helped Walsh on series 10 of &quot;The X Factor&quot; to select Sam Callahan, Luke Friend and Nicholas McDonald, who eventually finished second. That same year, she appeared in the music video for a cover of a-ha&#x27;s 1984 hit &quot;Take On Me&quot; on &quot;Children in Need&quot;. In December, she appeared on &quot;Celebrity Come Dine with Me&quot;, alongside Danniella Westbrook, Louie Spence and Hugo Taylor.

The following year, Sinitta was announced as joining the cast of the first series of the Channel 4 reality TV show &quot;The Jump&quot;. Sinitta was eliminated fourth overall, placing seventh.

Sinitta returned to her music career in 2014, with her comeback single being a cover of her mother Miquel Brown&#x27;s song &quot;So Many Men, So Little Time&quot;. She later performed the single at Pride in London. Sinitta returned to &quot;The X Factor&quot; on series 11 to assist Simon Cowell again that year, when she helped to choose Jay James, second place finalist Fleur East and eventual winner Ben Haenow.

In 2009, Sinitta became one of the main presenters on &quot;The Xtra Factor&quot;, on which she interviewed the contestants&#x27; friends and family. In 2011, she returned to the show during the live show stages as one of the presenters who visited the finalists&#x27; home towns. Her segment on the show became regular, and carried on into 2012 and subsequently 2013 and 2014. In 2016, she was announced as the producer and one of the lead presenters of the &quot;Xtra Factor&quot;; she stated that she had &quot;revamped&quot; the whole show.

Sinitta appeared in the hit reality TV show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; as a recurring character in 2016. Alongside this, Sinitta became a series regular on the chat show &quot;Up Late with Rylan&quot;, and also made appearances on &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot; as a contestant, although she was eliminated in Week 1.

Sinitta&#x27;s first Christmas track, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Lonely This Christmas&quot;, was released on 3 December 2021.

Sinitta took part in the 11th series of &quot;Celebs Go Dating&quot; but opted to leave the show in episode 14 after failing to find love. The final episode in the series took place in Cyprus, where Sinitta appeared for a surprise performance.

Throughout 2024 Sinitta took part in the live stage show tour of The Masked Singer (British TV series) performing and touring around Butlin&#x27;s holiday resorts.

== Personal life ==
Sinitta was married from 2002 to 2010 to Andy Willner, and has two adopted children. A series of autobiographical videos document her life, and a book is due to follow. Her past relationships and documentation of sexual assaults received media attention in 2018.

<text>Denham Golf Club railway station is a railway station near the villages of Baker&#x27;s Wood and Denham, Buckinghamshire, England. The station is on the Chiltern Main Line between and .

==History==

The station was opened on 22 July 1912, at the request of the Golf Club, which had opened the previous year. It is on what was the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, which had been opened in 1906. The station was originally called Denham Golf Club Platform, and it was built to serve the adjacent golf club. Between the two World Wars the platforms were lengthened and the station was made a halt. The original &quot;up&quot; platform was on the London side of the road bridge, and made of wood, with an access path connecting to the track leading to the Golf Club. In 1954 British Railways had a new concrete &quot;up&quot; platform built on the Wycombe side of the road bridge, opposite the &quot;down&quot; platform, which was also rebuilt in concrete. At the same time a proposed name change to &#x27;Higher Denham&#x27; was rejected.

The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.

The two waiting rooms are original Great Western Railway &quot;pagoda&quot; shelters. The ticket office, at road level on the down side, was also a pagoda building. Both waiting rooms and the original ticket office have been listed buildings since 27 November 1992, to prevent their replacement by the bus shelter type structures then being installed at other stations on the line. The ticket office was damaged by fire in 2005 and demolished early in 2007. It was replaced with a near replica in 2007, but unlike the original the new building has no clerk&#x27;s window. The waiting rooms have recently been repainted to match the ticket office.

The original platform lamp-posts were cast iron, marked with the initials &quot;G.W. &amp; G.C. Jt&quot; of the original operator. The lamp-posts were removed when the station lighting — and indeed the whole line — were modernised in about 1991, at about the time as the new Class 165 diesel multiple unit trains entered service.

The station was closed between 16 March to 19 June 2015 to allow Network Rail to undertake major repairs.

==Services==
All services at Denham Golf Club are operated by Chiltern Railways.

The typical weekday off-peak service is one train every two hours between London Marylebone and . Services to and from London operate as stopping services calling at most stations. Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, including some services that run semi-fast to and from London.

On weekends, the service is increased to hourly in each direction and northbound services are extended beyond High Wycombe to and from via .

<doc id="1218563" wikidata="Q717959" url="?curid=1218563" title="Tony Mowbray">
<text>Anthony Mark Mowbray (born 22 November 1963) is an English football manager and former footballer who is the currently manager of EFL Championship club West Bromwich Albion. Mowbray played for Middlesbrough, Celtic and Ipswich Town as a defender.

He began his coaching career with Ipswich Town and took his first managerial job at Scottish Premier League side Hibernian, where he won the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Manager of the Year award in his first season. He moved on to West Bromwich Albion in 2006, where he won the Football League Championship in 2008, but then suffered relegation from the Premier League the following year. Mowbray was then appointed as manager of Celtic, but was dismissed after nine months for poor results.

Mowbray subsequently took the manager&#x27;s role at another of his former clubs, Middlesbrough. After a poor start to the 2013–14 season, Mowbray left Middlesbrough in October 2013. After a spell with Coventry City, he was appointed Blackburn Rovers manager in February 2017. He was unable to prevent Rovers being relegated to League One, but then won promotion back to the Championship at the first attempt.

==Playing career==

===Middlesbrough===
After playing his first match for the club in 1982, Mowbray became captain of Middlesbrough in 1986 when he was just 22 years old. Affectionately known to Boro fans as &quot;Mogga&quot;, Mowbray became a legend in Middlesbrough for being a local lad who led the club from liquidation back into the top league of English football within two seasons.

In 2007, Mowbray was placed at number 7 in a chronological list of Middlesbrough legends compiled by local newspaper the &quot;Evening Gazette&quot;. The Middlesbrough club fanzine &quot;Fly me to the Moon&quot; is named after a quote about Mowbray from ex-Middlesbrough manager Bruce Rioch – &quot;If I had to fly to the moon I&#x27;d take Tony Mowbray, my captain, with me. He&#x27;s a magnificent man&quot;. In 1991 after 348 appearances for &quot;Boro&quot;, Mowbray moved to Scottish club Celtic for £1 million.

===Celtic===
During his playing career with Celtic, Mowbray&#x27;s wife Bernadette, a native of Renfrewshire, died of breast cancer. The episode is recalled in Mowbray&#x27;s book, &quot;Kissed by an Angel.&quot; It is often asserted that the &quot;huddle&quot; which Celtic players still perform before each match was arranged as a tribute to Bernadette. However, it was merely suggested by Mowbray on a pre-season tour of Germany to bring the squad together at a time of uncertainty. 

===Ipswich Town===
He later moved on to Ipswich Town, where he played for five years, becoming the team captain. He scored an equalising goal in the 2000 Division One playoff final victory against Barnsley. Ipswich won the match 4–2 and secured promotion to the FA Premier League. This match was both Mowbray&#x27;s Wembley debut and the last of his playing career.

==Coaching career==
Once his playing career finished he moved into coaching, starting as a first-team coach at Ipswich Town. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager of Ipswich, following the sacking of George Burley and prior to the appointment of Joe Royle.

===Hibernian===
In May 2004, Mowbray was appointed manager of Hibernian, replacing Bobby Williamson. He gained much acclaim for the job he did, winning the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association manager of the year award in his first season. Hibs finished in the top four in the SPL in his only two full seasons in charge, which was the first time since Eddie Turnbull&#x27;s time as manager that the club had done this in the top division in consecutive seasons.

The Hibs team progressed to the later stages of every domestic cup competition during his tenure, and made two appearances in European football. They lost heavily to Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the first round of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup and on the away goals rule to OB Odense in the 2006 Intertoto Cup. During mid-2006 Mowbray was interviewed for the vacant managerial position at Ipswich Town, but he rejected this approach. In September 2006 he signed a 12-month rolling deal with Hibs that was due to take effect from July 2007. Just one month later, however, Mowbray moved to West Bromwich Albion.

===West Bromwich Albion===
West Bromwich Albion appointed Mowbray as its manager on 13 October 2006. Mowbray faced the task of returning the Baggies to the Premier League after relegation the previous season. Although he managed to turn around the club&#x27;s poor away form, an indifferent run of results at home towards the end of the season meant that Albion finished fourth in The Championship table behind Sunderland, Birmingham City and Derby County, and faced the lottery of the Championship play-offs. Despite two famous victories over old rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-finals, Albion lost 1–0 to Derby County in the Wembley final.

As a result, during the close season, Mowbray set about restructuring his squad, moving out several of Robson&#x27;s players for multimillion-pound fees, after press reports of dressing room division.

High-profile players such as Jason Koumas, Diomansy Kamara and Curtis Davies were sold to Premier League clubs for large fees, in addition to the departures of Paul McShane, Nathan Ellington, Darren Carter and Steve Watson. Mowbray replaced them by signing a total of 14 permanent and loan players in the summer transfer window, making an overall profit in the process. His most expensive signings were Chris Brunt from Sheffield Wednesday for £3 million, Leon Barnett from Luton Town for £2.5 million, and James Morrison from Middlesbrough for £1.5 million.

Despite the large changes in his squad, Mowbray won the Championship Manager of the Month award in September 2007, after Albion gained 13 out of the maximum 15 points and climbed to 2nd in the Division.

At the start of 2008, Mowbray&#x27;s young Albion team topped the table, receiving growing plaudits from the media and supporters alike for their attractive brand of attacking one touch passing football, a reflection of Mowbray&#x27;s staunch footballing philosophy.

Mowbray guided West Brom to the EFL Championship title, meaning promotion to the Premier League and reached the semi-final of the FA Cup. The semi-final, the first to be played at the new Wembley Stadium, pitted West Brom against Portsmouth, the only remaining Premier League team left in the FA Cup. Portsmouth won the match 1–0 with the only goal of the game coming from Kanu. Mowbray won the Championship manager of the month award for April, as well as the League Managers Association manager of the year award.

After a poor 2008–09 season, West Bromwich were relegated from the Premier League, finishing 20th. Mowbray was still thought highly of by the fans, however, and this was evidenced by them wearing Mowbray masks at their last game of the season. Mowbray left the club for Celtic shortly afterwards.

===Celtic===
On 8 June 2009, it was reported that Celtic had approached West Bromwich Albion for permission to speak to Mowbray about their managerial vacancy. A compensation fee of £2 million was agreed, and Celtic declared Mowbray as their new manager on 16 June 2009. He was unveiled as Celtic manager at a press conference a day later. His coaching team was Neil Lennon, Peter Grant, Mark Venus, and Stevie Woods. On 12 September 2009 was named as the Coach of the Month of August in the Scottish Premier League.

Mowbray was described as &quot;beleaguered&quot; by &quot;The Herald&quot; after Celtic fell 10 points behind Old Firm rivals Rangers in the SPL title race after a 2–1 home defeat by Hibs.

Mowbray decided to make significant changes to his squad during the January 2010 transfer window, selling Gary Caldwell and Barry Robson, which apparently caused disruption to the team in the immediate aftermath of those deals being completed. Robbie Keane was recruited early in 2010 on a loan deal from Tottenham Hotspur amid great excitement, however further poor results, particularly a record 4–0 defeat by St Mirren, led to Mowbray being sacked on 25 March. It was reported in May 2010 that Celtic had yet to agree compensation with Mowbray and his management team.

===Middlesbrough===
Mowbray was appointed Middlesbrough manager on 26 October 2010, replacing Gordon Strachan. He lost his first match in charge, 2–1 against Bristol City, but followed this with wins against Crystal Palace and Scunthorpe. Mowbray guided Boro to Championship safety, having joined the club when they were 22nd in the league. The club finished the season well, winning their last four league games and finished 12th in the league table. The same season, Mowbray started giving youngsters a first team place such as Joe Bennett, Luke Williams and Richard Smallwood. Mowbray also started giving Marvin Emnes more playing time after returning on loan from Swansea City.

Middlesbrough began the 2011–12 season well and Mowbray won manager of the month for September. Middlesbrough relinquished the only unbeaten record in the league after a 2–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest in October 2011. After a poor start to 2012, Middlesbrough&#x27;s form picked up in late February with four wins in five games. Middlesbrough finished 7th in the 2011–12 season, missing out on a play-off place by one position.

After an unbeaten run in October 2012, Mowbray won the accolade of Championship Manager of the Month for that month. On 21 October 2013, it was announced that Mowbray had left the club with immediate effect after a run of two wins in 12 games in the 2013–14 campaign.

===Coventry City===
On 3 March 2015, Mowbray was appointed manager of Coventry City on a deal until the end of the 2014–15 season. With the club facing the possibility of relegation to the fourth-tier for the first time since the late 1950s, Tony Mowbray&#x27;s initial brief was to keep the club in the third-tier. A final-day victory away at Crawley Town was enough for Mowbray to secure League One football for the Sky Blues for the 2015–16 season.

Following protracted negotiations at the end of the season, Tony Mowbray agreed to sign a two-year contract extension to remain as Coventry City manager.

Mowbray resigned from Coventry City on 29 September 2016 after a string of results without a win.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 22 February 2017, Mowbray was appointed head coach of Blackburn Rovers on an 18-month contract, effectively lasting until the end of the 2017–18 season. Despite an improvement in form that offered some hope of survival, Blackburn were relegated to League One at the end of the 2016–17 season.

Mowbray signed a new contract that would keep him at the club until 2019, with an option of a further 12 months after that as well. Under his managership, Blackburn won promotion back to the Championship after a single year in League One. Their promotion was assured on 24 April, after a 1–0 away win against Doncaster Rovers.

In the 2018–19 season Mowbray led Blackburn to a final finish of 15th in the Championship. In the EFL Cup they reached the third round before being eliminated at AFC Bournemouth. In the FA Cup Blackburn were eliminated in the third round after extra time in a replay against Newcastle United.

In the 2019–20 season Mowbray secured an 11th-place finish in the Championship. In the EFL Cup the team reached the second round before defeat at Sheffield United. They were beaten in the third round of the FA Cup at fellow Championship side Birmingham City. Mowbray left Blackburn at the conclusion of his contract in May 2022 and was replaced by Jon Dahl Tomasson as head coach. He had served five years in the post.

===Sunderland===
On 30 August 2022, Mowbray was appointed head coach of Championship club Sunderland replacing Alex Neil.

He led the Black Cats to the play-offs, finishing 6th in his first season. Sunderland won the first leg against Luton Town 2–1 at the Stadium of Light but lost 2–0 in the second leg, losing 3–2 on aggregate.

On 4 December 2023, Mowbray was dismissed by Sunderland with the club in 9th position in the Championship.

===Birmingham City===
Mowbray was appointed manager of Championship club Birmingham City on 8 January 2024, replacing Wayne Rooney; he signed a two-and-a-half-year contract. On 19 February, the club announced that the need for medical treatment forced his temporary withdrawal from the role. His assistant, Mark Venus, took charge for a month, and on 19 March, Birmingham confirmed that Mowbray was taking formal medical leave until the start of 2024–25 pre-season and that their former manager Gary Rowett would take charge for the last eight games of the season. The team were unable to avoid relegation. On 21 May, Mowbray resigned as manager with immediate effect, stating that his health would not allow him to resume his duties soon enough for the needs of the club, and that once fit, he intended to prioritise &quot;quality time&quot; with his family before returning to football management. Mowbray later confirmed that he had been diagnosed with bowel cancer.

===Return to West Bromwich Albion===
On 18 January 2025, Mowbray was reappointed head coach of EFL Championship club West Bromwich Albion on a two-and-a-half-year contract.

==Personal life==
Mowbray has three sons with his wife, Amber Mowbray. His first wife, Bernadette Doyle Mowbray, died of breast cancer on New Year&#x27;s Day 1995, aged 26. Mowbray&#x27;s brother Darren is the current head of recruitment at Southampton.

<text>Paratransit (the term used in North America) or intermediate public transport (also known by other names such as community transport (UK)), is a type of transportation service that supplements fixed-route mass transit by providing individualized rides without fixed routes or timetables. Paratransit services may vary considerably on the degree of flexibility they provide their customers. At their simplest they may consist of a taxi or small bus that will run along a more or less defined route and then stop to pick up or discharge passengers on request. At the other end of the spectrum—fully demand-responsive transport—the most flexible paratransit systems offer on-demand call-up door-to-door service from any origin to any destination in a service area. In addition to public transit agencies, paratransit services may be operated by community groups or not-for-profit organizations, and for-profit private companies or operators.

The concept of intermediate public transport (IPT) or paratransit, exhibits considerable variation between developed and developing nations. In developed countries, it is typically a flexible, demand-responsive form of public transportation designed to provide point-to-point service. These systems are generally well-structured and organized. On the other hand, in developing countries, IPT often operates as an informal, cost-effective alternative to formal transportation modes. It tends to be unorganized and subject to minimal government regulation, serving as a prevalent form of spontaneous public transport that facilitates quick and convenient travel.

The importance of IPT may extends beyond mobility, as it can also contribute to the economic well-being of those who operate these services. In some cases, drivers of vehicles such as tempos and autorickshaws can earn a substantial daily income, which supports their livelihoods.

Typically, minibuses are used to provide paratransit service in USA. Most paratransit vehicles are equipped with wheelchair lifts or ramps to facilitate access.

In the United States, private transportation companies often provide paratransit service in cities and metropolitan areas under contract to local public transportation agencies.

==Terminology==

The use of &quot;paratransit&quot; (&quot;para transit&quot;, &quot;para-transit&quot;) has evolved and taken on two somewhat separate broad sets of meaning and application in North America; the term is rarely used in the rest of the world.

The more general meaning includes any transit service operating alongside conventional fixed-route services, including airport limousines and carpools. Since the early 1980s, particularly in North America, the term began to be used increasingly to describe the second meaning: special transport services for people with disabilities. In this respect, paratransit has become a subsector and business in its own right. The term &quot;paratransit&quot; is rarely used outside of North America.

Projects in the broader sense were documented by the Urban Institute in the 1974 book &quot;Para-transit: Neglected options for urban mobility&quot;, followed a year later by the first international overview, &quot;Paratransit: Survey of International Experience and Prospects&quot;. Robert Cervero&#x27;s 1997 book, &quot;Paratransit in America: Redefining Mass Transportation&quot;, embraced this wider definition of paratransit, arguing that America&#x27;s mass transit sector should enlarge to include micro-vehicles, minibuses, and shared-taxi services found in many developing cities. Paratransit, as an alternative mode of flexible passenger transportation that does not follow fixed routes or schedules, are common and often offer the only mechanized mobility options for the poor in many parts of the developing world.

==Diversion to taxis and ride-hailing services==

Some paratransit systems have begun subsidizing private taxi or ride-hailing trips as an alternative to the government-run or government-contracted system. For example, in 2010, Solano County, California dissolved Solano Paratransit and allowed paratransit-eligible passengers to buy $100 worth of taxi scrip for $15. This eliminated the need for passengers to book a week in advance, and reduced the cost to the county from $81 to about $30.

In 2016, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority began a pilot program which has subsidized paratransit passengers on Uber, Lyft, and Curb, up to a cap of $42 per ride. This retained the ability to book by phone, lowered the fare for riders, eliminated the need to book the trip a day in advance, eliminated shared trips, reduced in-transit time, and reduced the pickup wait time from 30 minutes to as low as 5 minutes in the urban core. With the subsidy cap initially set at $13, the MBTA reduced the average cost of a paratransit trip from $35 to $9. Pilot participants on average substantially increased the number of trips they took, but still at a lower overall cost to the agency. Availability of wheelchair-accessible vehicles remained an occasional problem, but these were only needed by about 20% of paratransit riders.

==In the United States==

===Rehabilitation Act of 1973===
Before passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), paratransit was provided by not-for-profit human service agencies and public transit agencies in response to the requirements in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 prohibited the exclusion of disabled people from &quot;any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance&quot;. In Title 49 Part 37 (49 CFR 37) of the &quot;Code of Federal Regulations&quot;, the Federal Transit Administration defined requirements for making buses accessible or providing complementary paratransit services within public transit service areas.

Most transit agencies did not see fixed route accessibility as desirable and opted for a flexible system of small paratransit vehicles operating parallel to a system of larger, fixed-route buses. The expectation was that the paratransit services would not be heavily used, making a flexible system of small vehicles a less expensive alternative for accessibility than options with larger, fixed-route vehicles. This however ended up not being the case. Often paratransit services were being filled up to their capacity. In some cases, leaving individuals who were in need of the door to door service provided by paratransit unable to utilize it due to the fact that disabled people who could use fixed-route vehicles also found themselves using these paratransit services.

===Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990===
With the passage of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act was extended to include &quot;all&quot; activities of state and local government. Its provisions were not limited to programs receiving federal funds and applied to all public transit services, regardless of how the services were funded or managed. Title II of the ADA also more clearly defined a disabled person&#x27;s right to equal participation in transit programs, and the provider&#x27;s responsibility to make that participation possible.

In revisions to Title 49 Part 37, the Federal Transit Administration defined the combined requirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act for transit providers. These requirements included &quot;complementary&quot; paratransit to destinations within 3/4 mile of all fixed routes (49 CFR 37.131) and submission of a plan for complying with complementary paratransit service regulations (49 CFR 37.135). Paratransit service is an unfunded mandate.

Under the ADA, complementary paratransit service is required for passengers who are 1) Unable to navigate the public bus system, 2) unable to get to a point from which they could access the public bus system, or 3) have a temporary need for these services because of injury or some type of limited duration cause of disability (49 CFR 37.123). Title 49 Part 37 details the eligibility rules along with requirements governing how the service must be provided and managed. In the United States, paratransit service is now highly regulated and closely monitored for compliance with standards set by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

As the ADA came into effect in 1992 (49 CFR 37.135), the FTA required transit systems in the United States to plan and begin implementing ADA compliant services, with full implementation by 1997 (49 CFR 37.139). During this period, paratransit demand and services rapidly expanded. This growth led to many new approaches to manage and provide these services. Computerized reservation, scheduling and dispatching for paratransit have also evolved substantially and are now arguably among the most sophisticated management systems available in the world of rubber tire transit (land-based non-rail public transit).

Since the passage of the ADA, paratransit service has grown rapidly as a mode of public transit in the United States. Continued growth can be expected due to the aging of baby boomers and disabled Iraq War veterans. The growth of the number of people requiring paratransit has resulted in an increase in cost for the paratransit industry to maintain these services. The results of this rising cost are the paratransit industry trying to get individuals to move from a reliance on paratransit vehicles to fixed-route vehicles. Due to the push to have paratransit vehicles being the main method of transportation for disabled individuals prior to the passing of the ADA, the paratransit industry is finding it hard to get individuals to switch over to fixed route transportation.

===Statistics===
Beginning in 2004, the bus, rail and motor coach trade magazine &quot;Metro Magazine&quot; began conducting annual surveys of public and private paratransit providers:

The US Government Accountability Office GAO released a report in November 2012 for the Federal Transit Administration which &quot;examined: (1) the extent of compliance with ADA paratransit requirements, (2) changes in ADA paratransit demand and costs since 2007, and (3) actions transit agencies are taking to help address changes in the demand for and costs of ADA paratransit service.&quot; The report found that &quot;average number of annual ADA paratransit trips provided by a transit agency increased 7 percent from 2007 to 2010&quot; and that the average cost of providing a paratransit trip is &quot;an estimated three and a half times more expensive than the average cost of $8.15 to provide a fixed-route trip.&quot;


The Maryland Transit Administration reported paratransit ridership increases of 15% in fiscal 2012, with double-digit increases expected in fiscal 2013 and 2014. The cost of providing paratransit service is considerably higher than traditional fixed-route bus service, with Maryland&#x27;s &quot;Mobility&quot; service reporting per-passenger costs of over $40 per trip in 2010.
Paratransit ridership growth of more than 10% per year was reported in the District of Columbia metropolitan area for 2006 through 2009. 
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority&#x27;s MetroAccess service in Washington, D.C. conducted a peer review of large urban paratransit systems in the US in 2009:
In response to increasing ridership and costs of providing paratransit service, WMATA made two significant changes beginning in 2010: the paratransit service area was reduced from jurisdictional boundaries to the ADA requirement of within a 3/4 mile corridor of fixed-route services; and, fares were linked to WMATA&#x27;s fixed route services and charged to the ADA allowable maximum of two times the fastest equivalent bus or rail fare.
These changes helped result in the first-ever reduction in the number of year-over-year trips between 2011 and 2012.

Annually, the Canadian Urban Transit Association publishes a fact book providing statistics for all of the Ontario specialized public transit services; as of 2015 there were 79 in operation.

=== Technology ===

The complicated nature of providing paratransit service in accordance with ADA guidelines led to the development of sophisticated software for the industry.

Intelligent transportation systems technologies, primarily GPS, mobile data terminals, digital mobile radios, and cell phones, and scheduling, dispatching, and call reservation software are now in use increasingly in North America and Europe. Interactive voice response systems and web-based initiatives are the next technology innovation anticipated for paratransit services.

Advanced analytics is another field being applied to paratransit operations. Some companies are beginning to integrate cloud computing models to find operational efficiencies and cost savings for smaller paratransit service providers.

==Canada==

There is no legislation providing details on paratransit standards, but the Canadian Urban Transit Association has provided voluntary guidelines for member transit agencies to use to determine paratransit needs and standards. Various operators including the TTC, BC Transit, OC Transpo and TransLink offer the service, and in the province of British Columbia paratransit is referred to as HandyDART throughout by both major transit operators.

== Developing countries ==

Paratransit systems in many developing world cities are operated by individuals and small business. The fragmented, intensely competitive nature of the industry makes government regulation and control much harder than traditional public transport. Government authorities have cited problems with unsafe vehicles and drivers as justifying efforts to regulate and &quot;formalize&quot; paratransit operations. However, these efforts have been limited by ignorance on the part of regulatory authorities and mistrust between
authorities and operators.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In sub-Saharan Africa, this form of transport (called &quot;transport artisanal&quot; in French) serves more than 70% of commuters, evolved organically and replaced formal transit after independence. Paratransit can take many forms, from the 16-seater minibus taxis (see share taxi), to motorbikes (boda boda).

== Other areas ==

In the United Kingdom, services are called community transport and provided locally. The Community Transport Association 
 is a central organization recognized by the government which &quot;promotes excellence through training, publications, advice, events and project support on voluntary, community and accessible transport.&quot;

In Zagreb, Croatia, the municipal mass transit operator ZET operates a fleet of minibuses equipped with several seats and lift for wheelchairs for on-demand transport of disabled persons.

In Hong Kong, Rehabus service is provided by the Hong Kong Society for Rehabilitation.

The New Zealand Transport Agency provides a comprehensive list of options in the country, including Total Mobility (TM) in Auckland.

In Australia, Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport under subsection 31 (1) of the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 mandated that as of 2002 &quot;all new public transport conveyances, premises and infrastructure must comply with the transport standards. Facilities already in operation at that time have between five and thirty years to comply with the standards.&quot;

In some parts of the world, transportation services for the elderly and disabled are obtainable through share taxi options, often without formal government involvement.

<text>The , also called the Seta River (瀬田川 &quot;Seta-gawa&quot;) and the Uji River (宇治川 &quot;Uji-gawa&quot;) at portions of its route, is the principal river in Osaka Prefecture on Honshu, Japan. The source of the river is Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture to the north.

The Yodo River, usually called the Seta River in Shiga Prefecture, begins at the southern outlet of the lake in Ōtsu. There is a dam there to regulate the lake level. Further downstream, the Seta flows into Kyoto Prefecture and its name changes to the Uji River. It then merges with two other rivers, the Katsura River and the Kizu River in Kyoto Prefecture. The Katsura has its headwaters in the mountains of Kyoto Prefecture, while the Kizu comes from Mie Prefecture. From the three-river confluence, the river is called the Yodo River, which flows south, through Osaka, and on into Osaka Bay. In Osaka, part of the river has been diverted into an artificial channel; the old course in the heart of Osaka is called the Kyū-Yodo River (literally, &#x27;Former Yodo River&#x27;). It serves as a source of water for irrigation and also powers hydroelectric generators.

==History==
The choice of the ancient capital Heian-kyō (now Kyoto) during the Heian period, was partly chosen because of the presence of the Yodo river that flows towards Osaka, and its outlet on the Seto Inland Sea.

The river played a very important role for the movement and transport of goods between Osaka and Kyoto, until the arrival of the first trains in the 1870s. In 1858, it is estimated there were 50 boats daily of all types that carried about 1,500 people from Osaka to Fushimi. In the 19th century, a trip by Steamboat between Osaka and Fushimi could take 12 hours.

There&#x27;s antique Ukiyo-e that depict the history of Yodo River (Uji River). The Uji River has a prominent place in the so-called &quot;Uji chapters&quot; of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, a novel written by the Japanese noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu in the early eleventh century.

Nowadays, the Uji River, or the Yodo River in Kyoto Prefecture, is a popular fishing spot during the summer and fall months.

==Transportation==
There are more than 50 bridges that cross the Yodo river. These include bridges for cars and trains.

<text>Donald MacKintosh VC (7 February 1896 – 11 April 1917) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
He was born in Glasgow on 7 February 1896, the son of Dr Donald James MacKintosh FRSE and his wife Margaret Fullarton. He and his mother went to live in Moffat while his father served in the Boer War, and he was then educated at St Ninian&#x27;s Preparatory School, Moffat. When the family returned to Glasgow he attended Glasgow Academy.

He was then sent as a boarder to Fettes College in Edinburgh. Intending to study medicine at Glasgow University his plans were disrupted by the First World War and he instead enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps where he was posted to the 3rd Scottish General Hospital and quickly rose to Acting Sergeant. In February 1915 he received his commission and joined the Seaforth Highlanders. Sent to France he was severely wounded on 21 March 1916 and after treatment at Le Touquet Hospital was sent home to Britain for hospital care. He returned to his battalion in July 1916.

He was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, The Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, Duke of Albany&#x27;s), British Army during the Battle of Arras when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 11 April 1917 north of Fampoux, France, during the initial advance, Lieutenant Mackintosh was shot through the right leg, but although crippled, continued to lead his men, and captured the trench. He then collected men of another company who had lost their leader and drove back a counter-attack, when he was again wounded and although unable to stand, nevertheless continued to control the situation. With only 15 men left he ordered them to be ready to advance to the final objective and with great difficulty got out of the trench, encouraging them to advance. He was wounded yet again and fell.

He is buried in grave II.C.49 in Brown&#x27;s Copse Cemetery near the village of Rouex, just north-east of Arras.

==Memorials==

His dying moments are immortalised in Fettes College&#x27;s War memorial, which features a statue of him urging his men onwards and bears the legend &quot;Carry on&quot;.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Highlanders Museum (Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders Collection), Fort George, Scotland

<doc id="1218572" wikidata="Q727120" url="?curid=1218572" title="HTTP pipelining">
<text>HTTP pipelining is a feature of HTTP/1.1, which allows multiple HTTP requests to be sent over a single TCP connection without waiting for the corresponding responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;HTTP/1.1-pipelining&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; HTTP/1.1 requires servers to respond to pipelined requests correctly, with non-pipelined but valid responses even if server does not support HTTP pipelining. Despite this requirement, many legacy HTTP/1.1 servers do not support pipelining correctly, forcing most HTTP clients to not use HTTP pipelining.

The technique was superseded by [[multiplexing]] via HTTP/2, which is supported by most modern browsers.

In HTTP/3, multiplexing is accomplished via QUIC which replaces TCP. This further reduces loading time, as there is no head-of-line blocking even if some packets are lost.

==Motivation and limitations==
The pipelining of requests results in a dramatic improvement in the loading times of HTML pages, especially over high latency connections such as satellite Internet connections. The speedup is less apparent on broadband connections, as the limitation of HTTP 1.1 still applies: the server must send its responses in the same order that the requests were received—so the entire connection remains first-in-first-out and HOL blocking can occur.

The asynchronous operations of HTTP/2 and SPDY are solution for this. By 2017 most browsers supported HTTP/2 by default which uses multiplexing instead.

Non-idempotent requests such as codice_1 should not be pipelined. Read requests like codice_2 and codice_3 can always be pipelined. A sequence of other idempotent requests like codice_4 and codice_5 can be pipelined or not depending on whether requests in the sequence depend on the effect of others.

HTTP pipelining requires both the client and the server to support it. HTTP/1.1 conforming servers are required to produce valid responses to pipelined requests, but may not actually process requests concurrently.
Most pipelining problems happen in HTTP intermediate nodes (hop-by-hop), i.e. in proxy servers, especially in transparent proxy servers (if one of them along the HTTP chain does not handle pipelined requests properly then nothing works as it should).

Using pipelining with HTTP proxy servers is usually not recommended also because the HOL blocking problem may really slow down proxy server responses (as the server responses must be in the same order of the received requests). 

Example: if a client sends 4 pipelined GET requests to a proxy through a single connection and the first one is not in its cache then the proxy has to forward that request to the destination web server; if the following three requests are instead found in its cache, the proxy has to wait for the web server response, then it has to send it to the client and only then it can send the three cached responses too.

If instead a client opens 4 connections to a proxy and sends 1 GET request per connection (without using pipelining) the proxy can send the three cached responses to client in parallel before the response from server is received, decreasing the overall completion time (because requests are served in parallel with no head-of-line blocking problem).&lt;ref name=&quot;HTTP/1.1-concurrency&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The same advantage exists in HTTP/2 multiplexed streams.

==Implementation status==
Pipelining was introduced in HTTP/1.1 and was not present in HTTP/1.0.

There have always been complaints about browsers, proxy servers, etc. not working well when using pipelined requests / responses, up to the point that for many years (at least till 2011) software developers, engineers, web experts, etc. tried to summarize the various kind of problems they noted, to fix things and to give advices about how to deal with pipelining on the Open Web.

===Implementation in web browsers===
Of all the major browsers, only Opera had a fully working implementation that was enabled by default. In other browsers HTTP pipelining was disabled or not implemented.
*Internet Explorer 8 does not support pipeline requests, due to concerns regarding buggy proxies and head-of-line blocking.
*Internet Explorer 11 does not support pipelining.
*Mozilla browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox, SeaMonkey and Camino) used to support pipelining; however, it was removed in Firefox 54. When it was supported, pipelining was disabled by default to avoid issues with misbehaving servers. If pipelining was enabled by the user, Mozilla browsers used some heuristics, mostly to turn pipelining off for older Microsoft IIS servers. The removal was eventually backported to SeaMonkey.
*Konqueror 2.0 supports pipelining, but it is disabled by default.
*Google Chrome previously supported pipelining, but it has been disabled due to bugs and problems with poorly behaving servers.
*Pale Moon (web browser) supports pipelining, and is enabled by default.

===Implementation in web proxy servers===
Most HTTP proxies do not pipeline outgoing requests.

Some HTTP proxies, including transparent HTTP proxies, may manage pipelined requests very badly (e.g. by mixing up the order of pipelined responses).

Some versions of the Squid web proxy will pipeline up to two outgoing requests. This functionality has been disabled by default and needs to be manually enabled for &quot;bandwidth management and access logging reasons&quot;. Squid supports multiple requests from clients.

The Polipo proxy pipelines outgoing requests.

Tempesta FW, an open source application delivery controller, also pipelines requests to backend servers.

===Other implementations===
The libwww library made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), supports pipelining since version 5.1 released at 18 February 1997.

Other application development libraries that support HTTP pipelining include:

*Perl modules providing client support for HTTP pipelining are HTTP::Async and the LWPng (libwww-perl New Generation) library.
*The Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 supports HTTP pipelining in the module codice_6.
*Qt class codice_7, introduced in 4.4.

Some other applications currently exploiting pipelining are:

*IceBreak application server since BUILD389
*phttpget from FreeBSD (a minimalist pipelined HTTP client)
*libcurl previously had limited support for pipelining using the CURLMOPT_PIPELINING option, but this support was removed in version 7.65.0
*portsnap (a FreeBSD ports tree distribution system)
*Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) supports pipelining.
*Subversion (SVN) has optional support for HTTP pipelining with the serf WebDAV access module (the default module, neon, does not have pipelining support).
*Microsoft Message Queuing on Windows Server 2003 utilises pipelining on HTTP by default, and can be configured to use it on HTTPS.
*IBM CICS 3.1 supports HTTP pipelining within its client.

Testing tools which support HTTP pipelining include:

*httperf
*Nmap supports pipelining requests with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

<doc id="1218593" wikidata="Q5540792" url="?curid=1218593" title="George Howell (soldier)">
<text>George Julian &quot;Snowy&quot; Howell, VC, MM (19 November 1893 – 23 December 1964) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Howell was decorated with the Victoria Cross following his actions during the Second Battle of Bullecourt, in which he ran along the parapet of a trench bombing the German forces attacking his position through the use of grenades, and thus driving them back.

Born in a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Howell was employed as a builder before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in June 1915. Allotted to the force&#x27;s 1st Battalion, he served at Gallipoli prior to transferring to the Western Front. Participating in the Somme offensive of 1916, Howell was wounded at Pozières and promoted to corporal in early 1917. During an attack on a German held village, he led a rifle bombing section and was awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Severely wounded in his Victoria Cross action, Howell underwent a prolonged hospitalisation period before returning to Australia and receiving his discharge on medical grounds. Settling in Coogee, he gained employment by working on the advertising staff of several newspapers. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell served with the Australian Eastern Command Headquarters but soon sought his discharge and enlisted with the United States Sea Transport Service. He died in 1964 at the age of 71.

==Early life==
Howell was born in the Sydney suburb of Enfield, New South Wales, on 19 November 1893, the fourth son of English-born carpenter, Francis John Howell, and his Australian wife, Martha (née Sweeny). Howell was educated at Croydon Park and Burwood Public Schools, before receiving an apprenticeship as a bricklayer. Becoming a builder, he was employed in his native Enfield area of Sydney.

==First World War==
On 3 June 1915, Howell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. Allotted to the 7th Reinforcements of the 1st Battalion as a private, he embarked from Sydney for Egypt on 14 July aboard HMAT &quot;Orsova&quot;. Joining the 1st Battalion at Gallipoli on 1 November, Howell served on the peninsula until the Allied evacuation the following month. Returning to Egypt, the battalion spent several months training in the desert in preparation for service on the Western Front.

The 1st Battalion embarked for France in March 1916, and by April the unit was entrenched in the Fromelles sector. In the third week of July, Howell was wounded in the Battle of Pozières while taking part in the Somme offensive. Evacuated to a hospital in Sheffield, England, during early August, Howell attended a training school before returning to his battalion on 26 November. Appointed lance corporal on 10 December, he was promoted to corporal on 6 February 1917.

On 9 April 1917, Howell took part in the 1st Battalion&#x27;s attack on the German held village of Demicourt. During the engagement, Howell led a rifle bombing section at the forefront of his company against the German position. The section was held up several times in their advance due to heavy machine gun fire, but managed to overcome the opposition and continue the advance each time. For his actions during the battle, Howell was awarded the Military Medal, the recommendation of which cited his &quot;... courage and devotion to duty ... was of great assistance to his company in the capture of its objectives&quot;. The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 26 May 1917.

===Victoria Cross===
In preparation for an attack on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—was attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was entrenched in the old German line known as &#x27;OG1&#x27;. Three of the battalion&#x27;s companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory.

From the initial attack, only the Canadians on the extreme right and the 3rd Australian Brigade on the extreme left were able to capture and hold their set objectives. Over the course of the next three days, severe fighting took place and further troops were drawn in to hold and extend the gains of 3 May. On 6 May, the Germans launched a counter-attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches; it was during this engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross.

At 06:00, Howell, who was in charge of a post to the right of the line, noticed the battalion on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire. Immediately alerting battalion headquarters, Captain Alexander MacKenzie—who had assumed temporary command of the battalion—hurriedly organised a group of non-combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance. A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion, Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans, all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb attack. Forcing the Germans back along the trench, Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun. Soon exhausting his supply of bombs, Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the trench wounded. Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire, and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later, it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty-eight separate wounds. Due to his actions, the ground which had been lost was soon retaken, and the German attack was later repulsed.

The full citation for Howell&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 27 June 1917, reading:

===Hospitalisation and repatriation===
Howell&#x27;s multiple wounds at Bullecourt required a prolonged hospitalisation period for treatment, and he was sent to the Norfolk and Norwich War Hospital in England. On 21 July 1917, Howell was invested with his Victoria Cross and Military Medal by King George V in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. A photograph of the pair together was taken at this time, and later published in the &quot;Times History of the War&quot;. Promoted to sergeant, Howell returned to Australia on 31 October. Having not adequately recovered from his wounds, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 5 June 1918 on medical grounds. Howell&#x27;s father and one of his brothers had also served on the Western Front during the First World War; his father with the 54th Battalion and his brother, Frederick, with the 1st Pioneer Battalion.

==Later life==
On 1 March 1919, Howell married Sadie Lillian Yates, a nurse, at St Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Sydney. The pair settled in Coogee, where Howell was employed on the advertising staff of &quot;Smith&#x27;s Newspapers Ltd&quot; and later the &quot;Bulletin Newspaper Co. Pty Ltd&quot;. By 1933, he was the New South Wales representative for the &quot;Brisbane Standard&quot; and the &quot;Queensland Worker&quot;.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell once again offered his services and enlisted in the Australian Army on 14 October 1939. Posted to Eastern Command Headquarters, Paddington, he was granted the rank of staff sergeant, but found staff work to be dull and sought his discharge in February 1941. In August 1944, Howell enlisted in the United States Army for service in the United States Sea Transport Service, and was thus able to participate in the invasion of Leyte at the commencement of the Philippines campaign.

In December 1953, following his wife&#x27;s death, Howell moved from Sydney to Western Australia. Accompanied by his grandson, the journey took four days by train before the pair arrived in the Perth suburb of Applecross, where Howell was to live with his married daughter, Norma. He later moved to Gunyidi, via Watheroo, where he was to reside for a few years before returning to Perth. In 1956, he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London&#x27;s Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the Victoria Cross.

Howell died at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood, Perth, on 23 December 1964. He was granted a funeral with military honours, before his body was cremated and his ashes interred at Karrakatta Cemetery, Perth. Howell&#x27;s name is commemorated by a plaque in the Western Australian Garden of Remembrance, and his Victoria Cross and other medals are on display at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

<text>Major General Matthew Charles Dixon VC CB (5 February 1821 – 8 January 1905) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, and a Knight of the Legion of Honour.

He was the eldest son of Major-General Matthew Charles Dixon RE (1791–1860) and his second wife Emma Dalton (1794–1853) and was born in France on 5 February 1821.

==Military career==
He entered the British Army in 1839, was promoted to lieutenant in 1841, and to captain in 1848.

He was 34 years old, and a captain in the Royal Regiment of Artillery, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 17 April 1855 at Sebastopol, the Crimea, at about 2pm the battery commanded by Captain Dixon was blown up by a shell from the enemy which burst in the magazine, destroying the parapets, killing or wounding 10 men, disabling five guns and covering a sixth with earth. The captain reopened fire with the remaining gun and continued firing it until sunset, despite the heavy concentration of fire from the enemy&#x27;s batteries and the ruined state of his own.

As well as the VC, he received the 5th class of the Medjidie and the Turkish Medal and was made a Knight of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

He was promoted to major and lieutenant-colonel in 1855, colonel in 1862 and retired from the Royal Artillery in 1869 with the honorary rank of major-general. He later achieved the rank of major general.

==Later life==
On 13 May 1862 he married Henrietta Letitia Eliza Bosanquet (1834–1926), daughter of Admiral C.J. Bosanquet of Wildwood. They had no family, and his medal was in the possession of a descendant of his sister, Frances Maria Clarke née Dixon. It was sold to the Lord Ashcroft collection in 2014.

On leaving the army he took up residence at &quot;Woodgate&quot;, Pembury (near Tonbridge) and lived there until his death on 7 January 1905 aged 84. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery on 12 January. His wife survived him by 21 years.

<text>Major Allan Ebenezer Ker VC (5 March 1883 – 12 September 1958) was a British Army officer and a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
He was born in Edinburgh on 5 March 1883 the son of Robert Darling Ker WS (1853-1940) and his wife Johanna Johnston. The family lived at 14 Findhorn Place in the Grange district.

He was educated at Edinburgh Academy. He then studied law at the University of Edinburgh. Before the First World War he had his own legal practice at 5 George Street in the New Town and was living at &quot;St Abbs&quot;, a villa on Russell Place in Trinity.

In 1908 he joined a unit of the Territorial Force: the Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Mounted Rifles. In 1914 he went to Aberdeen to settle the affairs of his cousin, Captain Arthur Milford Ker who had been killed in the first weeks of the First World War and Allan was persuaded to join his cousin&#x27;s regiment; the Gordon Highlanders.

He was 35 years old, and a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders, British Army, attached 61st Battalion, Machine Gun Corps during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 21 March 1918 near Saint-Quentin, France, when the enemy had penetrated the British line, Lieutenant Ker, with one Vickers gun, succeeded in holding up the attack, inflicting many casualties. He then stayed at his post with a sergeant and several men who had been badly wounded, beating off bayonet attacks with revolvers, the Vickers gun having been destroyed. Although exhausted from want of food and gas poisoning, as well as from fighting and attending to the wounded, Lieutenant Ker only surrendered when all his ammunition was spent and the position overrun - he had managed to hold 500 of the enemy off for three hours.

He was, however, captured in the event and spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war only being released in December 1918, a few weeks after the armistice of 11 November 1918. He was gazetted for the VC on 4 September 1919 and was presented the medal personally by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 26 November 1919. On 11 November 1920 he was one of the 100 VC winners chosen as the guard of honour, escorting the gun carriage to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Westminster Abbey.

He later achieved the rank of major. He was demobbed in 1922 and went back to practising law, but in London rather than Edinburgh.

In 1926 he was one of four VC holders who laid a wreath after the dedication of the Machine Gun Corps Memorial at Hyde Park Corner. The others were Arthur Henry Cross, Reginald Graham, and William Allison White.

In the Second World War he served on the Directorate of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. His duties included attendance at the Potsdam Conference in July/August 1945.

He died at New Garden Hospital in Hampstead, North London, on 12 September 1958 aged 75. He is buried in West Hampstead Cemetery but was also memorialised in 2018 on his parents restored grave in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh.

==Recognition==
Anthony Powell later used him as the inspiration for the character of Colonel Finn in his novels &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Art&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Military Philosophers&quot; (1968).

A plaque was erected on his birthplace at 16 Findhorn Place in The Grange, Edinburgh in 2018.

<text>Dumgoyne is a hill prominent on the edge of the Campsie Fells and is a well-known landmark visible from Glasgow. It is a volcanic plug and is high. The plug is readily reached from a path beside Glengoyne Distillery or via a water-board track from the contiguous villages of Strathblane and Blanefield to the east or Killearn to the west.

From Strathblane-Blanefield, the path begins as Campsie Dene Road, which almost immediately becomes a private road after passing between the village&#x27;s war memorial and the grounds of St. Kessog&#x27;s Catholic Church. Public parking is not permitted on the private road, but several cars can be parallel parked on the church-side of the road between the main road and the driveway to the church (the Number 10 bus from Glasgow also stops close by), and the walk begins by following this private road for approximately . After passing several gates on the way, turn to the right where there is another gate. Follow this path up and around the side Dumfoyn, and from here the path steepens, as it goes up Dumgoyne. The summit is marked by a small standing stone erected some years ago by local Rotarians. This route to Dumgoyne passes close to the Spittal of Ballewan (545811) the former site of a medieval Knights Templar hospital.

Close to Dumgoyne is Dumfoyn (547825; ) a similar but less remarkable and much less climbed hill. From these hills the much smaller but heavily wooded Dumgoyach (531810; ) can be seen. Dumgoyach due to its association with the Edmonstons of Duntreath provides a historic link with Alice Keppel and Queen Camilla.

==Hamlet==
Dumgoyne is also the name of a nearby hamlet, a popular stop for people walking on the West Highland Way.

<text>The Goulburn Correctional Centre, (also known as The Circle), is an Australian supermaximum security prison for males. It is located in Goulburn, New South Wales, three kilometres north-east of the central business district. The facility is operated by Corrective Services NSW. The Complex accepts prisoners charged and convicted under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation and serves as a reception prison for Southern New South Wales, and, in some cases, for inmates from the Australian Capital Territory.

The High Risk Management Centre (commonly called the SuperMax) was opened in September 2001. This was the first such facility in Australia and makes the centre the highest security prison in Australia. Supermax was completely renovated over 9 months and completed in April 2020.

The current structure incorporates a massive, heritage-listed hand-carved sandstone gate and façade that was opened in 1884 based on designs by the Colonial Architect, James Barnet. The complex is listed on the Register of the National Estate and the New South Wales State Heritage Register as a site of State significance.

==History==

Goulburn&#x27;s first lock-up was built around 1830 and gallows were built as early as 1832 when floggings were common. The first Goulburn Gaol was proclaimed on 28 June 1847, attached to the local Courthouse. When the Controller of Prisons first reported to parliament in 1878 Goulburn Gaol had accommodation for 63 segregated and 127 associated prisoners, and held 66 prisoners; inclusive of one female.

The plan for the new prison complex was developed in 1879 as part of a scheme to &quot;bring the Colony from its backward position as regards to prison buildings&quot;, in J. Barnet&#x27;s office under the supervision of William Coles. It was built by Frederick Lemm of Sydney between 1881 and 1884 at a cost of sixty-one thousand pounds. It was formally proclaimed as a public gaol, prison and house of correction from 1 July 1884. The gaol also became a place of detention for male prisoners under sentence or transportation. The new gaol increased the capacity of the gaol to 182 separated and 546 associated prisoners. In the year ended 1884 there were a total of 295 prisoners in custody. The opening of the gaol was part of the public works boom in the town during the 1869- 6 period and boosted employment as well as local industry. In 1893 prison labour was used to build an additional 127 cells to Goulburn Gaol, six exercise yards for &#x27;youthful offenders&#x27; and a further yard for prisoners awaiting trial. This extension enabled Goulburn gaol to operate on the principle of restricted association which was gradually being adopted throughout the Colony. The following year additional cells were erected for female prisoners. The &#x27;7th class&#x27; prisoners were moved into the former women&#x27;s cells thus preventing contact between these young prisoners and serious offenders. Steam cooking facilities were installed and a chimney was erected, new workshops were planned to create one of the most complete prison complexes in NSW.

Areas for agricultural cultivation were introduced in 1897-1899 and a bakery was constructed in 1916. In 1957, work commenced on a new cell block outside the walls of the gaol to accommodate prisoners employed at the agricultural area. This wing opened in 1961. During 1966-1967 a new education block and auditorium were completed.

For eighty years up to the 1970s, Goulburn was the establishment within the NSW penal system with a particular role in the reformation of first time and young offenders. It had a long history of agricultural and industrial training and education and built up a strong economic and social association with the town of Goulburn.

The prison was renamed the Goulburn Reformatory in 1928, and became known as the Goulburn Training Centre in 1949. In 1992 the centre was again renamed Goulburn Correctional Centre.

In 1986–1988, the first major redevelopment project was undertaken. It involved the extension of the perimeter walls to include a new industrial and sports area and the construction of a high security segregation unit.

Initially, Goulburn was one of the principal gaols in NSW. Its early prime focus was upon the first offenders where a program of employment, educational opportunities, physical education in addition to the scheme of restricted association was credited for a relatively low level of re-offending.

In 2015, Goulburn attracted controversy after a prisoner who was housed in the maximum security wing escaped after he cut through a gate at the back of a small secure exercise yard attached to his cell, tied bed sheets together to scale a wall, and put a pillow around his waist to avoid being hurt by razor wire. In the same year the Minister for Corrections announced that security would be tightened following a breach when an inmate was caught with a contraband mobile phone that he used to upload pictures and text to a social media website.

In late 2016, a two-year trial of mobile phone jamming equipment at the prison was approved by the Australian Communications &amp; Media Authority; following a successful trial of jamming at the Lithgow Correctional Centre.

==High-Risk Management Correctional Centre==
Opened in 2001 at a cost of A$20 million, the Super Maximum facility is located within the confines of the Goulburn Correctional Centre. Initially called the High-Risk Management Unit (HRMU, also referred to by inmates as HARM-U), it was Australia&#x27;s first Supermax prison since the closure of the Katingal facility at the Long Bay Correctional Centre in 1978. The facility is the most secure prison within the NSW correctional system, and the inmates are subject to very strict daily regimes, and under intense scrutiny by security. Goulburn HRMCC has received complaints by prisoners, including the lack of natural light and fresh air; access to legal books; the use of isolation and solitary confinement; limited and enclosed exercise; self-mutilation and harsh treatment. A 2008 report by the New South Wales Ombudsman explained that there is &quot;no doubt… that the HRMU does not provide a therapeutic environment for these inmates&quot;.

In spite of the security measures inside the HRMCC, in June 2011 it was reported that an unnamed inmate in the centre had allegedly smuggled a mobile phone into the unit and plotted two kidnappings and a shooting. Criminal charges were laid against the inmate and his alleged co-conspirators.

<doc id="1218607" wikidata="Q964382" url="?curid=1218607" title="James Gandon">
<text>James Gandon (20 February 1743 – 24 December 1823) was an English architect best known for his work in Ireland during the late 18th century and early 19th century. His better known works include The Custom House and the surrounding Beresford Place, the Four Courts and the King&#x27;s Inns in Dublin and Emo Court in County Laois.

== Early life ==
Gandon was born on 20 February 1742 in New Bond Street, London, at the house of his grandfather Peter Gandon, a French Huguenot refugee. He was the only son of Peter Gandon (b. 1713), a gunmaker, and Jane Burchall (possibly née Wynne). From 1749 he was educated at Shipley&#x27;s Drawing Academy where he studied the classics, mathematics, arts and architecture. On leaving the drawing academy he was articled to study architecture in the office of Sir William Chambers. Chambers was an advocate of the neoclassical evolution of Palladian architecture, although he later made designs in the Gothic Revival style. However, it was Chambers&#x27;s palladian and neoclassical concepts which most influenced the young Gandon.

In 1765, Gandon left William Chambers to begin practice on his own. His first commission was on Sir Samuel Hellier&#x27;s estate at the Wodehouse, near Wombourne. Gandon&#x27;s new practice, whilst successful, always remained small. In about 1769 he entered an architectural competition to design the new Royal Exchange in Dublin. The plan eventually chosen was by Thomas Cooley. However, Gandon&#x27;s design came second and brought him to the attention of the politicians who were overseeing the large-scale redevelopment of Dublin, one of the largest cities in Europe at the time.

During the following years in England, Gandon was responsible for the design of the County Hall in Nottingham. Between 1769 and 1771, he collaborated with John Woolfe on two additional volumes of Vitruvius Britannicus, a book of plans and drawings of Palladian revival buildings by such architects as Inigo Jones and Colen Campbell. During his English career he was awarded the gold medal for architecture by the Royal Academy, London in 1768.

In 1771 he was paid five guineas ″To making of a design of a Theater at Wynnstay″ He was also paid nine guineas for giving ″36 Lessons in Architecture″ to Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. The Theatre was converted from a huge kitchen which had been built for the stupendous Coming of Age Celebrations of Sir Watkin in that year and was used from 1771 until Sir Watkin died. The British Library has a drawing of the Theatre which was used for an admission ticket for a performance which belonged to King George III.

== Designing the Custom House ==

In 1780 Gandon declined an invitation from a member of the Romanov family to work in St. Petersburg but in 1781, at the age of 38, he accepted an invitation to Ireland from Lord Carlow and John Beresford (the Revenue Commissioner for Ireland) to supervise the construction of the new Custom House in Dublin. Thomas Cooley, the original architect on that project, had died and Gandon was chosen to assume complete control. Gandon employed the sculptor Edward Smyth to work on the Custom House and all of his Dublin buildings. The new Custom House was unpopular with Dublin Corporation and some city merchants who complained that it moved the axis of the city, would leave little room for shipping, and it was being built on what at the time was a swamp. It is said that the Irish people were so opposed to the Custom House and its associated taxes that Beresford had to smuggle Gandon into the country and keep him hidden in his own home for the first three months. The project was eventually completed at a cost of £200,000, an enormous sum at the time.
This conspicuous commission proved to be the turning point in Gandon&#x27;s career and Dublin was to become Gandon&#x27;s home and its architecture his &quot;raison d&#x27;etre&quot; for the remainder of his life. He took a house in Mecklenburgh Street (now Railway Street), that he might be near the residence of John Beresford, the main proponent for the development of the city. The city, which in Gandon&#x27;s lifetime was to grow to become the fifth largest city in Europe, was undergoing vast expansion, mostly following the Palladian and neoclassical designs already popularised in the city by Edward Lovett Pearce and Richard Cassels.

The newly formed Wide Streets Commission employed Gandon to design a new aristocratic enclave in the vicinity of Mountjoy Square and Gardiner Street. The new classical terraces of large residences became the Town houses of members of the newly built and imposing Irish Houses of Parliament situated in College Green south of the river. Gandon also designed Carlisle Bridge (now O&#x27;Connell Bridge) over the River Liffey to join the north and south areas of the city.
== Other Irish works ==

Gandon&#x27;s other works in the city included:

*The Four Courts of 1786,
*The centre portion of King&#x27;s Inns Henrietta Street begun in 1795 and completed in 1816 by his pupil Henry Aaron Baker,
*The improvement of the Rotunda Assembly rooms 1786.

Gandon&#x27;s least well known building in Dublin is his Royal Military Infirmary of 1787 on Infirmary Road. He worked for the Wide Street Commissioners and designed the facades for the shops at ground floor of D&#x27;Olier Street, Burgh Quay and some surrounding streets. One of his most prestigious commissions, which came in 1785, was to extend Pearce&#x27;s monumental Houses of Parliament, for which he built the (well known today) curved screen wall which links his new corinthian portico for the House of Lords facing College Street to Pearce&#x27;s original building. This building is now the Bank of Ireland.
His work in Ireland was not confined to Dublin, nor to civic and municipal commissions. In 1784 he designed the new courthouse and Gaol in Broad Street (Demolished) in Waterford; and he also worked on many private houses, including Abbeville, Dublin which he designed for John Beresford in 1792, Emsworth, Malahide, County Dublin in 1794 for James Woodmason, a London stationer who became involved in banking in Dublin, and Sandymount Park for the painter William Ashford. In County Laois, he designed Emo Court, County Laois in 1790–96 for the Earl of Portarlington, and also Coolbanagher Church of Ireland Church just outside Emo village.

His town planning work included creating a new setting for the Custom House with a curved terrace of townhouses at Beresford Place, Dublin, and the New Geneva town in County Waterford which was never completed. He designed a number of buildings including walled gardens, and farm buildings at Carriglass just outside Longford Town.

== Criticism and decline ==

The success of Gandon&#x27;s designs and commissions were however not reflected in personal popularity: he attracted huge criticism from his enemies. So hated was the taxation symbolised by the Custom House that the stigma of being its creator was to taint the appreciation of his work throughout his lifetime. It was even claimed that Gandon was designing buildings to boost his self-esteem. In the 1780s, during the construction of the Four Courts, one broadsheet published daily letters from a correspondent castigating and insulting Gandon and his designs. This further fostered the hate directed against him. In truth Gandon had merely rediscovered what architects from Vitruvius to Thomas Jefferson believed, which was that the Palladian form was eminently suitable for the design of public buildings where huge civic prestige was required.

In 1798, revolution broke out on the streets of Ireland and Gandon, an unpopular figure, hurriedly fled to London. On returning to Dublin he found a much changed city. The Irish Houses of Parliament, which had inspired the great period of development, were closed. The 1801 Act of Union had placed Ireland directly under rule from London. One by one the Anglo-Irish aristocracy left their fine new town houses in the city. As a direct result Dublin declined from being one of the great cities of Europe.

Gandon had married Eleanor Smullen on 26 July 1770. They had five children, four daughters and a son, James. Some sources state he was widowed shortly after his invitation to Dublin, but others state there is evidence of his wife in Dublin for a short time. Gandon died on 24 December 1823 at his home in Lucan, County Dublin, having spent forty-two years in the city. He was buried in the church-yard of Drumcondra Church, in the same grave as his friend the antiquary Francis Grose. It seems that already by the time of his death his reputation was undergoing a re-evaluation, for his tomb-stone reads: – &quot;&quot;Such was the respect in which Gandon was held by his neighbours and friends from around his home in Lucan that they refused carriages and walked the 16 miles to and from Drumcondra on the day of his funeral&quot;.&quot;

In the years since his death, Ireland&#x27;s troubled history has resulted in destruction and damage to much of Gandon&#x27;s work, especially his interiors. The Custom House was burnt down in 1921 by the IRA during the War of Independence and parts of it were rebuilt using a darker shade of native limestone. The Four Courts was shelled by government forces during the Civil War in 1922 and partly destroyed by a huge explosion. Even though it was later rebuilt, much of Gandon&#x27;s original work is gone and the interior can today only be appreciated from his original drawings. The wings to the Four Courts were shortened by one bay, in order to widen the roadway, and to permit more lanes of traffic. This alteration seriously damages the original composition. Yet despite this, the stamp of his work is still clearly visible in Georgian Dublin today.

<text>Henry Mitchell Jones VC, also known as Henry Michael Jones (11 February 1831 – 18 December 1916) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. In later life he was a British diplomat.

Jones was born in Dublin. He entered the army as an ensign in 1849 and exchanged to the 7th Regiment of Foot (later the Royal Fusiliers) in 1854 during the Crimean War. As a lieutenant at the Battle of the Alma on 20 September 1854, whilst carrying the Queen&#x27;s Colour he was severely wounded by gunshot through the lower jaw. He carried the bullet in his jaw for thirty years until he complained of a toothache. He saw a doctor who removed the bullet which had been lodged in his jawbone.

Jones was promoted to captain in 1855 and was awarded the VC &quot;for having distinguished himself, while serving with the party which stormed and took the Quarries, before Sebastopol, by repeatedly leading on his men to repel the continual assaults of the enemy during the night. Although wounded early in the evening, Captain Jones remained unflinchingly at his post until after daylight the following morning.&quot; This took place on 7 June 1855, during the Siege of Sebastopol, but Jones&#x27; Victoria Cross was not gazetted (formally announced) until September 1857.

Jones resigned his commission three months prior to the notification of the award of his Victoria Cross, and entered the Diplomatic Service. He was appointed Consul in the Fiji and Tonga Islands 1863, Consul-General at Tabreez 1868, at Christiania 1875, and at Philippopolis (now Plovdiv) 1880. In 1889 he was appointed Minister Resident at Bangkok and in 1895 he was transferred to be Minister Resident and Consul-General at Lima and at Quito.

He retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1898 and died in Eastbourne, Sussex, on 18 December 1916.

==The medal==
Jones&#x27; Victoria Cross is displayed at the Victoria Barracks in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Angus Falconar Douglas-Hamilton VC (20 August 1863 – 26 September 1915) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Born at Brighton in 1863, he was the son of Major General Octavius Douglas-Hamilton and Katherine Macleod, and a great-great-grandson of Lt.Gen.James Douglas-Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton and 1st Duke of Brandon. Douglas-Hamilton was educated at Foster&#x27;s Naval Preparatory School, and latterly at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Having been commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders in 1884, he served in the Sudan, Gibraltar, Malta, South Africa, North China, and India, attaining the rank of major by 1901. He retired in 1912, whilst remaining on the army&#x27;s reserve list.

==First World War==
In August 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, he was 50 years old. Recalled, and promoted to a temporary Lieutenant-Colonelcy in the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders Reserve of Officers, British Army, commanding the 6th Battalion, the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25–26 September 1915 during operations on Hill 70 at the Battle of Loos, France, Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas-Hamilton, when the battalions on his right and left had retired, rallied his own battalion again and again and led his men forward four times. The last time he led all that remained, about 50 men, in a most gallant manner, and was killed at their head. It was due to his bravery, and splendid leadership that the line at this point was able to check the enemy&#x27;s advance.

He is commemorated on the Loos Memorial.

<text>Lance Corporal Hubert William Lewis (1 May 1896 – 22 February 1977) was a Welsh soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Milford Haven, he left school at 13 to work in a local fish market. He enlisted in the Welsh Regiment in 1914 and, after serving briefly in France, he was reposted to the Macedonian front of the First World War. During a night raid on German trenches, despite being wounded twice, he single-handedly captured three enemy soldiers before carrying a wounded officer back to safety under artillery fire. For his actions he was awarded the Victoria Cross, becoming the youngest Welsh recipient of the award. He later performed a similar feat when carrying a captain to safety in 1918 during an assault on an enemy position.

After the war, he returned to Milford Haven where he married and raised three children. He continued working in the local fish market, first as a trader before becoming the foreman for an ice company at the site for over 40 years. He served in the Home Guard during the Second World War. Prior to his death in 1977, he was the last surviving Welsh Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War.

==Early life==
Lewis was born on 1 May 1896 in Robert Street in the coastal town of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire. He was the second of four children born to Adrian Lewis, a brass moulder and fitter at Milford Haven docks, and his wife Sarah (née Broome). His father was known as &quot;Stokey&quot; Lewis and Hubert became known as &quot;Young Stokey&quot; as a child before taking on the original nickname as he grew older. The family later moved to 27 Dartmouth Gardens and Lewis attended Milford Haven National School as well as a Wesleyan Sunday School. After leaving school at the age of 13, Lewis went to work as a packer in the town&#x27;s fish market for local businessman George Bradbury. A local newspaper reporter described him as an &quot;unpredictable prankster&quot; and recounted incidents where Lewis lightly nicked the reporter with a fish knife and where he once &quot;swiped&quot; the editor of the &quot;Western Telegraph&quot; with a hake. He also played amateur football for local side Milford Haven Stars.

==First World War==
In early September 1914, 18-year old Lewis attended a recruitment meeting organised by a Major Birt, who was also his father&#x27;s employer, which drew crowds of 2000–3000 people before enlisting in the 11th (Service) Battalion of the Welsh Regiment which had been formed little over a month before as the Cardiff Commercial Battalion, a pals unit. At 10 a.m. the next day, Lewis, was one of 75 local volunteers who left Milford Haven before being split into smaller groups with Lewis and 45 others travelling to Maindy Barracks in Cardiff, the rest joining the Royal Engineers or the Royal Artillery. Two days later, his unit was moved to Lewes as part of the 67th Brigade, part of the 22nd Division. He also underwent training at Eastbourne, Hastings, Aldershot and Seaford. It was at Aldershot where Lewis and his battalion were visited by King George V and Lord Kitchener. On 5 September 1915, just over a year after enlisting, Lewis and his unit sailed to Boulogne, France from Southampton. Several days after his arrival, he was attached to the 9th (Service) Battalion, Border Regiment, the 22nd Division&#x27;s pioneer battalion, as a machine gunner. 

===Victoria Cross===
Soon after, Bulgaria, which had been neutral since the war began, entered the war on the German side. Lewis&#x27;s division was one of several that were removed from the Western Front and posted to Greece to prepare for a possible attack by enemy forces on the Macedonian front under the command of Lieutenant-General Bryan Mahon of the British Salonika Army. The force initially entrenched themselves in the Thessaloniki area in preparation for an attack but the decision was eventually made to launch an offense against the enemy forces. On 17 October 1916, the order was given for Lewis&#x27; battalion to launch a raid on German trenches near Dorsale. However, bad weather delayed the attack for several days before it was eventually launched at 9 p.m. on 22 October. The battalion was split into four parties with Lewis assigned to &quot;D&quot; Party. During the initial rush, D Party was spotted by a German sentry after crossing only of ground, allowing the enemy forces to open fire with machine guns and artillery. They were targeted by &quot;intense&quot; shelling for 40 minutes during which Lewis received a wound to his arm. However, he turned away medical assistance after seeing more badly wounded men needing attention.

During a brief respite in the shelling, Captain Guthrie Morgan led a charge of around 150 men, including Lewis, into the German trenches where they were able to gain control after a period of hand-to-hand combat. During the fighting, Lewis received a second wound as the Germans attempted to counterattack but refused treatment for a second time. He continued through the enemy trench where he came across three German soldiers. Using his rifle butt and bayonet, Lewis briefly fought with the men before they surrendered to him, in an incident witnessed by Captain Morgan and another soldier.

The German forces launched another counterattack, this time successful, and Lewis and his battalion were ordered to retreat. In the descent back to their lines, Lewis heard the cries of a wounded officer, Lieutenant Turner, who was lying on the fire step of a trench, and, despite suffering from two wounds himself, carried the wounded soldier over his shoulder the rest of the way through enemy artillery fire. They reached safety at 4:30 a.m. the following morning at which point Lewis let down Turner before collapsing though exhaustion.

For his actions, Lewis was awarded for the Victoria Cross (VC). His award was announced on 15 December 1916 in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, the citation reading:

Lewis returned home in January 1917, attending a press conference at The Grand Hotel in Cardiff where he stated &quot;I joined The Welsh Regiment as a raw recruit, and I am proud of the fact that I have not disgraced the honour and proud record of the regiment.&quot; He also corrected errors in the reporting of his actions, including the number of wounds he had received which had initially been reported as three. He later returned to his hometown Milford Haven, where he was given a gold watch, before receiving his VC from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 5 February 1917. At the age of 20, he was the youngest Welsh recipient of the award.

===Later actions===
Only ten days after being awarded his VC, Lewis returned to the front lines of the Balkans campaign. In June 1918, Lewis again received praise for his bravery under fire when he rescued Captain Morgan during an assault near Salonika. After seeing his captain fall, he rushed to his aid despite suffering the effects of poisonous gas and fighting off nearby Bulgarian troops. He then carried Morgan back to safety. Morgan later wrote to Lewis and stated &quot;It is impossible for me to express how grateful I am to you for saving my life…You certainly deserve a Bar to your Victoria Cross.&quot; However, he was not put forward for the award, only one other soldier (Noel Godfrey Chavasse) received a second VC during the First World War. He was also awarded the Médaille militaire by France in July 1917. He was promoted to lance corporal on 16 April 1919.

==Later life==
At the end of the hostilities, Lewis returned to his hometown Milford Haven and continued work at the fish market where he worked as a merchant before his employer went out of business during the 1920s. He took several jobs in order to earn a living before again returning to the fish market to work for the Milford Haven Ice Company, unloading delivery lorries. He eventually became the foreman for the company at the site where he worked for a further 43 years and was locally known by the nickname &quot;VC Lewis&quot;.

Lewis married his fiancée, Edith Eveline Etherington, in Haverfordwest on 9 October 1920 and the couple had three sons, Edward, Vernon and Arthur. In 1921 he was asked to unveil the County of Pembroke War Memorial in Haverfordwest.

During the Second World War he served in the Home Guard and was given a Certificate of Good Service. One of his sons, Vernon, a flight sergeant in the RAF, was killed in a nighttime bombing raid over Germany in August 1943 at the age of 22; his Avro Lancaster was shot down by an enemy night fighter. Lewis subsequently received his son&#x27;s posthumous Distinguished Flying Medal from King George VI in May 1946. He also suffered further loss during the 1960s when his grandson was accidentally killed by a reversing bus.

Lewis became active in the veteran community and was the vice-president of the Milford Haven branch of The Royal British Legion. He became friends with fellow VC recipient Ivor Rees. In 1964, the pair, along with another VC recipient, Edward Thomas Chapman, attended the film premiere of &quot;Zulu&quot; where they dined with Michael Caine. His wife Edith died in 1969. Lewis died eight years later in his hometown of Milford Haven on 22 February 1977 at the age of 80. He was buried in Milford Haven Cemetery with his wife. Prior to his death, he was the last surviving Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross from the First World War.

Lewis&#x27;s medals, including his VC, were sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in 1993 for £26,450. They were later bought by Lord Ashcroft in 1999 and his VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Percy Thompson Dean, VC (20 July 1877 – 20 March 1939) was a British businessman, politician, sailor, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, and also a politician.

==Victoria Cross==
Dean was 40 years old and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 and 23 April 1918 at Zeebrugge, Belgium, after &quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Iphigenia&quot; had been scuttled, their crews were taken off by Motor Launch 282 commanded by Lieutenant Dean. He embarked more than 100 officers and men under constant and deadly fire from heavy and machine-guns at point blank range. This complete, he was about to clear the canal when the steering gear broke down, so he manoeuvred on his engines and was actually clear of the entrance to the harbour when he was told there was an officer in the water. He immediately turned back and rescued him.

Dean later achieved the rank of lieutenant commander.

==Post-war==
After the war, Dean was elected at the 1918 general election as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Blackburn, serving until the 1922 general election. He was chairman of the Moelferna and Dee Side Slate and Slab Quarries Company in Wales between the wars.

Dean was one of 100 VC recipients to form the VC Guard of Honour at the State Funeral for the Unknown Warrior held on 11 November 1920. 

Dean&#x27;s VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Memorials==
On 23 April 2003, a blue plaque was unveiled at Dean&#x27;s former residence at 19 Gorse Street, Blackburn.

In April 2018, a stone was unveiled outside Blackburn Town Hall to recognise Dean in a ceremony attended by Dean&#x27;s family and local dignitaries.

<text>The Adventures of Champion is an American children&#x27;s Western television series that aired from September 23, 1955, to March 3, 1956, for 26 episodes on CBS. In the United Kingdom, the series was re-broadcast under the title Champion the Wonder Horse. The series was repeated on and off by the BBC in the UK throughout the 70s, 80s and early 90s, with its final BBC broadcast being the episode &quot;The Stone Heart&quot; on 23 January 1993.

==Synopsis==
Set in the 1880s in the American Southwest, the show features 12-year-old Ricky North, who lives on a ranch with his uncle Sandy. Ricky has an uncanny ability to find himself in some kind of trouble, but is always rescued by his faithful friend Champion, the Wonder Horse, a wild stallion who has befriended Ricky. His adventures (and rescues) always involve Ricky&#x27;s other constant companion, a German Shepherd named Rebel.

== Cast ==
*Champion as Champion, the Wonder Horse
*Barry Curtis as Ricky North
*Jim Bannon as Sandy North
*Blaze as Rebel, the dog

== Background and production ==

=== Casting (animals) ===
The horse starring in &quot;The Adventures of Champion&quot; was known as Television Champion, or TV Champ, for short. In real life, the Wonder Horse, Champion, was owned by Gene Autry who, over many years, owned a succession of celebrity horses bearing the same name. TV Champ was distinguished by his chestnut coat, blond mane and tail, four white stockings and broad white facial blaze. He made frequent appearances with Autry in films and television during the 1950s. Unlike his fictional namesake, TV Champ was a gelding.

Ken Beck and Jim Clark, in their book, &quot;The Encyclopedia of TV Pets: A Complete History of Television&#x27;s Greatest Animal Stars&quot;, quote animal trainer Bob Blair as identifying the dog as J.R., the canine that had the title role in &quot;The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin&quot; TV program. &quot;He was the best-trained dog in the business,&quot; Blair said.

=== Filming ===
Filmed by Flying A Productions, the series was shot on location within California. Vasquez Rocks. was used for the introduction and episodes. The Andy Jauregui Ranch at Placerita Canyon, Newhall was also used for several exteriors.

==Episodes==
==Related shows==
The television program used characters similar to those in the 1949–50 radio serial, &quot;The Adventures of Champion&quot;. The radio serial told of young Ricky West (rather than Ricky North), who was raised on a ranch by his adoptive Uncle Smoky (rather than Sandy). Ricky was often accompanied by his German Shepherd, Rebel.

Beginning in 1950, &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot;, a western/cowboy television series, aired for 91 episodes on CBS. &quot;The Adventures of Champion&quot; was a prime time spinoff for the 1955–1956 season.

<text>John McDermond VC (1832 – 22 July 1868) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
McDermond was approximately 22 years old, and a private in the 47th (the Lancashire) Regiment of Foot, British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 5 November 1854 at the Battle of Inkerman, Crimea, Private McDermond and Captain Hugh Rowlands saved the life of a Colonel William O&#x27;Grady Haly who was lying wounded on the ground surrounded by the enemy. Private McDermond rushed to the rescue and killed the man who had wounded the colonel. 

There is a painting depicting this event hung in the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment Museum at Fulwood Barracks, Preston.
According to his service record John McDermod was from Clackmannan and was discharged due to injury. He died 19 July 1866 Glasgow, Scotland of typhus. Although only 38 his profession was marked down as &quot;pensioner&quot;.

It is generally believed that he is buried in Paisley but this may be because a person with the same name died at the poor house there in 1868

==The medal==
Of the 16 V.C.&#x27;s awarded for actions during the Battle of Inkerman, two are unaccounted for – those won by John McDermond and John Byrne of the 68th Durham Light Infantry, the other 14 being in private collections or museums.

It is thought a Victoria Cross medal (missing the suspender bar and ribbon) found by Tobias Neto in the mud of the river Thames in December 2015 could be that of John McDermond or John Byrne - the medal having the date of 5 November 1854 engraved on the reverse.

<text>Jordan Nathaniel Marcel Knight (born May 17, 1970) is an American-Canadian pop singer and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist of the boy band New Kids on the Block (NKOTB), which rose to fame in the 1980s and 1990s, using a falsetto style of singing influenced by The Stylistics. After New Kids on the Block split in 1994, he launched a solo career. 

Knight&#x27;s first solo album, released in 1999, and his latest solo album, released in 2011, reached the Top 50 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. As of 2011, he released four Top 40 singles, the best known being &quot;Give It to You&quot; in 1999. Knight has released three solo albums, one remix album, and one EP. On May 31, 2011, Knight released the studio album, &quot;Unfinished&quot;. Knight has sold over 1.5 million records worldwide as a solo artist. 

==Early life and career==
Knight was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the youngest of six children to Canadian parents; his father Allan Knight, an Episcopal priest, is from Meaford, Ontario and his mother Marlene (née Putnam) is from Dunnville, Ontario. Consequently, Knight holds dual US and Canadian citizenship. Before achieving fame, he played in a youth baseball league in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

Jordan was almost 14 years old in 1984 when he joined New Kids on the Block, a band assembled in Boston by producer Maurice Starr. His fellow members included his older brother Jonathan, as well as Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg, and Danny Wood. Over the next few years, he began writing songs and teaching himself piano and keyboard instruments. Starr, who wrote much of the New Kids&#x27; material, was reluctant to add his work to the band&#x27;s repertoire. One night while the band was on tour in 1989, Knight noticed Tommy Page playing piano at a hotel one night and approached him, and the two played piano together for a period of time. Knight played Page a verse from what would become &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Everything&quot;, a song that he wanted to save for a future solo project. The two later collaborated on finishing the song, and Page asked if he could record it for his upcoming album. Knight agreed and co-produced the track, and fellow band members Wood and Wahlberg contributed, respectively co-writing and co-producing the song. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Everything&quot; became a hit single for Page upon its release in February 1990, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for a week that April, spending thirteen weeks in the top 40, and eventually being certified gold by the RIAA.

The group originally disbanded in 1994 but reunited in 2008, scoring 2 top 40 hits and embarking on a successful tour. In the fall of 2010, they teamed with the Backstreet Boys (BSB), creating the boy band NKOTBSB, and toured in summer 2011.

New Kids on the Block have sold over 80 million records worldwide, generated hundreds of million of dollars in concert revenues and paved the way for later boy bands like Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC.

==Solo career==
Knight made a comeback by releasing his first solo single, &quot;Give It To You&quot;, on February 16, 1999. The single, produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; and No. 35 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, went gold, and was nominated for the 1999 MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video, though it lost to Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; La Vida Loca&quot;. He was also nominated for &quot;Favorite Male Singer&quot; at the 2000 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. Knight&#x27;s self-titled debut album, released on May 25, was certified gold for sales of over 500,000 copies in the US on July 7, 1999. The album peaked at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and No. 9 on the Top Internet Albums chart, and later won an Aspire Music Award for Best Male Album (Pop).

Knight released a remix album, &quot;Jordan Knight Performs New Kids on the Block: The Remix Album&quot;, in 2004.

In 2005, Knight released an EP titled &quot;The Fix&quot; supported by the lead single &quot;Where Is Your Heart Tonight,&quot; which reached its peak at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. He continued to tour extensively in 2005–2006 promoting the EP.

In September 2006, Knight&#x27;s next album, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, was released by Transcontinental Records. The first single was &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; a duet with fellow 1980s pop singer Deborah Gibson, that peaked at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.

On May 31, 2011, Knight released his third solo album, &quot;Unfinished&quot;. The album reached No. 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart, No. 48 on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; and No. 55 in Canada. He began his Live and Unfinished Tour on December 11, 2011. Knight performed the announced dates with Boston-based band Elevation Theory.

In 2014, Knight teamed up with Nick Carter for the release of the album &quot;Nick &amp; Knight&quot;, touring throughout the fall of that year to support the album.

==Television==
Knight was a judge on the &quot;American Idol&quot; spin-off, &quot;American Juniors.&quot; He was a third-season cast member on the VH1 reality television series &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; with other celebrities in 2004, and later appeared in the 2007 spin-off &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot;.

In 2005, Knight appeared on the British show &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time,&quot; where he performed &quot;Give It to You,&quot; as well as a cover of &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; by Mario.

In September 2005, Knight also starred in a British documentary on Five in the UK called &quot;Trust Me – I&#x27;m a Holiday Rep.&quot; Six celebrities spent 10 days in the role of an Olympic Holidays holiday rep in Ayia Napa, Cyprus.

Knight also appeared on the game show &quot;Identity,&quot; hosted by Penn Jillette. In September 2011, he featured as a judge on the CBC show &quot;Cover Me Canada.&quot;

==Personal life==
Knight has been married to Evelyn Melendez since 2004. They have two sons, Dante Jordan (born August 25, 1999) and Eric Jacob (born February 21, 2007).

Knight lives in Milton, Massachusetts, where in 2016, he became a partner in a local Italian restaurant called Novara.

<text>Hugh McIver VC MM &amp; Bar (21 June 1890 – 2 September 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 28 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Scots (The Lothian Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 August 1918 east of Courcelle-le Compte, France, Private McIver was employed as a company-runner and under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire carried messages regardless of his own safety. Single-handed he pursued an enemy scout into a machine-gun post and having killed six of the garrison, captured 20 prisoners and two machine-guns. Later he succeeded, at great personal risk, in stopping the fire of a British tank which was directed in error against our own troops. He was killed in action 10 days later near Courcelles, France, on 2 September 1918.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Scots Museum, Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.

Born in Linwood, Renfrewshire, he spent much of his life in Newton (Cambuslang) and is commemorated in both towns. In 2015, Kier Homes named a street in their Hawkhead Village development in Paisley, Hugh McIver Avenue, in memory of him.

<text>Major Henry Kelly VC, MC &amp; bar (10 July 1887 – 18 July 1960) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Kelly was born on 10 July 1887 in Collyhurst, Manchester. He was a temporary second lieutenant in the 10th Battalion, The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding) Regiment during the First World War at the time of his award of the Victoria Cross in 1916. He was awarded a Military Cross and later a bar to that medal in Italy in 1918. Other military awards include the Belgian Croix de Guerre, the French Médaille Militaire and the Spanish Grand Laurelled Cross of San Fernando.

==Early life==
Henry Kelly was born to Charles Kelly of Dublin and Jane (née McGarry) of Manchester. He was left the oldest of 10 children after his father died in 1904. He was educated at St Patrick&#x27;s School and Xaverian College, both in Manchester. After moving to King Street in Moston, he was employed as a sorting clerk at the Newton Street sorting office and trained with the &#x27;Manchester Royal Engineers territorial Regiment&#x27;. On 5 September 1914, aged 27, he enlisted into the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders as a private. He transferred to the Manchester Regiment and became a lance corporal and two weeks later a sergeant major. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 12 May 1915 into the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding Regiment), and was posted to France the same month. On 29 October 1916 he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and, after being presented with his VC ribbon by the corps commander on 11 September, he was made a temporary lieutenant.

===Award of Victoria Cross===

On 4 October 1916, when Kelly was 29 years old, he performed an act of bravery at Le Sars, France, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Later he was also awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and the French Médaille Militaire.

===Award of Military Cross===
Kelly was made a temporary captain in September 1917 and in 1918 moved with the 10th Battalion to Italy. In June 1918, Kelly saw action in Italy on the Asiago Plateau, where he led a successful raid on Ave, to the south of Asiago, on the night of 21–22 June, after which he was awarded the Military Cross:

===Award of Bar to Military Cross===
Kelly was involved in later actions on Il Montello above the River Piave. On 27 October 1918 during the Battle of the Piave River he led a successful attack across the Piave, after which he was awarded a bar to his Military Cross:

Kelly left the army in 1920, having been promoted to the rank of temporary major.

==Between the wars==
Kelly spent 1922–1923 in the Irish National Army during the Irish Civil War, then later joined the International Brigades, in 1936, as a foreign volunteer fighting against Fascists in the Spanish Civil War and was ranked Comandante General. Here he was awarded the Grand Laurelled Cross of San Fernando.

After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, aged 52, he rejoined the British army and served as a lieutenant in the Pioneer Corps from December 1940, transferring to the Cheshire Regiment in October 1941. From October 1943 until February 1944, he was in charge of the District Claims office of London District, at Curzon Street. He was at that time court martialled and severely reprimanded for making an allegedly false claim for £2 10s. In November 1944 he resigned his commission and left the army to return to work for the Post Office.

==Post 1945==

Kelly continued to work for the Post Office and lived in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Following a long illness Kelly died, on 18 January 1960, in Prestwich Hospital. He was buried in Southern Cemetery, Manchester.

==Medal location==
Kelly&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed in The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regimental Museum, located within the Bankfield Museum, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England.

<text>Thomas Alfred Jones, VC, DCM (25 December 1880 – 30 January 1956), also known as &#x27;Todger&#x27; Jones, was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. There is a statue of Jones at Runcorn War Memorial.

==Biography==

Jones was born in Runcorn, Cheshire, on 25 December (Christmas Day) 1880. He was a private in the 1st Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War. He was known affectionately locally as &#x27;Todger&#x27; Jones.

He was 35 years old when on 25 September 1916, during the Battle of Morval, Jones performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was with his company covering the advance in front of a village, when he noticed an enemy sniper away. He left his trench on his own, and crossed no man&#x27;s land without covering fire. Although one bullet went through his helmet and another through his coat, he returned the sniper&#x27;s fire and killed him. Near the enemy trench, he saw two more Germans firing on him while simultaneously displaying a white flag. Jones shot them both. Upon reaching the enemy trench, he found several occupied dug-outs and single-handedly disarmed 102 Germans. Three or four were officers, and the entire trench was taken by Jones and his comrades.

While still serving with the 1st Cheshires, in September 1918 he won the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for his actions near Bapaume when he &quot;went forward five times with messages through an intense barrage [and] led forward stragglers and placed them in positions. His fine example and utter fearlessness of danger were a great incentive to the men.&quot;

Jones continued to live in Runcorn and died on 30 January 1956, aged 75. He is buried in Runcorn Cemetery. His Victoria Cross medal group is displayed at the Cheshire Military Museum in Chester.

==Statue==

On 3 August 2014 a bronze statue of Jones was unveiled in the Memorial Garden, Runcorn. Following a ceremony in front of the War Memorial opposite to the garden, the statue was unveiled by four veterans and active servicemen. It was created by the Scottish sculptor David Annand.

==Honours==

<text>William Merrifield VC, MM (9 October 1890 – 8 August 1943) was an English-born Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions on 1 October 1918, during the Battle of the Canal du Nord. Earlier in the war he had been awarded the Military Medal.

==Early life==
William Merrifield was born at Brentwood, Essex in England on 9 October 1890. He emigrated to Canada for employment, settling in Ottawa. He later moved to Sudbury, where he worked as a fireman on the Canadian Pacific Railway. He also joined the 97th Regiment, known as the Algonquin Rifles, a unit of Canada&#x27;s militia.

==First World War==
On 23 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, Merrifield enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), being posted to the 2nd Battalion. He fought at the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, and two years later was transferred to the CEF&#x27;s 4th Battalion, part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division. He participated in the Battle of Passchendaele, and for his conduct during the fighting was awarded the Military Medal (MM).

On 1 October 1918, along with the rest of the 1st Division, the 4th Battalion was engaged in the Battle of the Canal du Nord, advancing near Abancourt, north of Cambrai. However, the flanking British division had failed to progress its own front, and the Canadians were exposed to machine-gun fire. Merrifield, now a sergeant and leading a platoon, made a solo foray to deal with two machine-gun posts. Despite being wounded, he was successful in his endeavours and resumed the advance with his platoon. It was not until he was again wounded that he was treated for his wounds. He was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows:
King George V presented Merrifield with a VC on 26 January 1919, in a ceremony at York Cottage in Sandringham. He returned to Canada a few months later and was discharged from the CEF.

==Later life==

Resuming to civilian life, Merrifield remained in the militia, in which he was now a lieutenant. In late 1919, he accompanied the then Prince Edward for part of his royal tour of Canada. Two years later, Merrifield married Maude and the couple lived in Sault Ste. Marie, in Ontario. In 1939, he suffered a stroke. His health never recovered and he died in a hospital in Toronto on 8 August 1943. He is buried in West Korah Cemetery in Sault Ste. Marie.

A school in Sault Ste. Marie was named after him in recognition of his service to his country although it was closed in 2015. The armoury of the 56th Field Artillery Regiment in Brantford, Ontario, is also named for Merrifield.

==Victoria Cross==
In addition to the VC and MM, Merrifield was also entitled to the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. He also held the King George VI Coronation Medal. His medals were donated to the Canadian War Museum by the Merrifield family in November 2005.

<text>Allan Leonard Lewis VC (28 February 1895 – 21 September 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Lewis was born in Herefordshire, but moved to South Wales to find work. On the outbreak of the First World War he was employed by the Great Western Railway as a bus driver at Neath. he joined up in March 1915. The GWR has no record of Lewis on its Rolls of Honour or War memorials, and it may be that he joined up without the company&#x27;s agreement, and thus lost his post and pension rights. By September 1918 he was 23 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 6th Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment, British Army during the same war when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 18 September 1918 at Rossnoy, near Lempire, France, Lance-Corporal Lewis was in command of a section on the right of the attacking line, held up by intense machine-gun fire. He saw that two guns were enfilading the line and crawled forward alone, successfully bombed the guns and by rifle fire made the whole team surrender. On 21 September he rushed his company through the enemy barrage, but was killed while getting his men under cover from heavy machine-gun fire.

==Further information==
Lance-Corporal Lewis is remembered on the Vis-en-Artois memorial near Vis-en-Artois British Cemetery, Haucourt as he has no known grave.
The medal was handed to Lance-Corporal&#x27;s Lewis&#x27;s elder brother Frank by their mother. She made him promise that the medal would never be sold as she said that she lost a son, and she considered any profit from it would be blood money. Frank kept the medal in his home until his death. It was then agreed by the children of Frank that as he still had a brother, alive, he could hold the medal for his remaining days and then it was to be placed in a museum, either the regimental or local Hereford. When this brother died, the medal was assumed to be part of his estate and was kept by sole beneficiary of the will. Despite requests from Frank&#x27;s close family, the medal was not returned and therefore not put into a museum.

On the centenary of Lewis&#x27; sacrifice a number of events took place to honour him.

On 18 September 2018 two plaques honouring Allan Lewis (one in English and one in Welsh) were unveiled at Neath Station, by his great niece, Dawn Lewis. The Railway Heritage Trust funded these plaques.

On 21 September 2018, the exact centenary of his death, a bronze statue of Lewis was unveiled in Hereford&#x27;s Old Market Shopping Centre. The statue was designed by Jemma Pearson, and was unveiled by Her Majesty&#x27;s Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire, The Dowager Countess of Darnley. The statue was funded by the A L Lewis VC Memorial Fund, the chair of which is Dawn Lewis. In addition to the statue, a memorial plaque was dedicated to Allan in the Lady Arbour at Hereford Cathedral.

At about the same time the modern Great Western Railway named one of its new InterCity bi-mode trains after Allan Lewis, recognizing him despite the predecessor company having not done so.
