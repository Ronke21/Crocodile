<text>Patricia Lynne Duffy is the author of &quot;Blue Cats and Chartreuse Kittens: How Synesthetes Color Their Worlds&quot;, the first book by a synesthete about synesthesia. &quot;Blue Cats&quot; has been reviewed in both the popular press as well as in academic journals, &quot;Cerebrum&quot; and the &quot;APA Review of Books&quot;. The book describes Duffy&#x27;s own experience of synesthesia, as well as that of the many synesthetes she interviewed, along with theories of what causes synesthetic perception.

She is the author of the chapter, &quot;Synesthesia and Literature&quot;, included in the &quot;Oxford Handbook of Synesthesia&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2013). Duffy has given a number of presentations on synesthesia in literature, with an emphasis on her four categories of literary depiction, at universities including the University of Texas at Houston, the Leibniz University Hannover, McMaster University and Vanderbilt University as well as an event hosted by the organization Ediciones Fundación Internacional Artecittà at the University of Granada.

In addition, she has presented on the topic of synesthesia at a number of universities including Yale University, Princeton University, the University of California, San Diego, Rockefeller University, the University of Virginia, the University of Almería, the University of Jaén, Stockholm University and others. Duffy was invited to be a Plenary Speaker on synesthesia at the &quot;Towards a Science of Consciousness&quot; conference at University of Arizona in Tucson. She is a co-founder of and consultant to the American Synesthesia Association.

Duffy is an instructor in the UN Language and Communications Programme. She has an M.A. from Teachers College, Columbia University, from which she received the 2009 Distinguished Alumni Award. She is a member of the UN Society of Writers and on the management committee of the UN Staff One Percent for Development Fund as well as the founder of the development fund&#x27;s Authors-for-Literacy reading series. She has taught English at New York University, the City University of New York, and the UN Language and Communications Programme, including staff training abroad at UN offices in Addis Ababa, Arusha, Entebbe, Kigali, Monrovia, Nairobi, and Port-au-Prince. Her article on development micro-projects, &quot;Kitengesa, Uganda: Happy Developments&quot; was published on the web site of Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. In addition, Duffy has written articles for publications including &quot;New York Newsday&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; (article &quot;All the Colors of the Rainbow&quot;), the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, and the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. Duffy wrote two award-winning essays, &quot;Taipei Tales&quot; and &quot;Dining in French&quot; for the literary journal &quot;Literal Latte&quot;. Her work is included in the anthologies &quot;They Only Laughed Later: Tales of Women on the Move&quot; (Europublic Press) and &quot;Soulful Living&quot; (HCI). She has traveled extensively throughout Europe and Asia and lived and worked in China for a year and a half.

Her special interest is in what she terms &quot;personal coding&quot;, the unique way in which each person codes information and makes a one-of-a-kind &quot;inner map&quot; of the world around them. She has been interviewed about her research and her synesthesia by a number of publications including the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine, &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, as well as on TV and radio channels such as National Public Radio, the BBC, Public Radio International and the Discovery Channel.

<text>Raymond Paul Mears (born 7 February 1964) is a British woodsman, instructor, businessman, author and TV presenter. His TV appearances cover bushcraft and survival techniques. 

He is best known for the TV series &quot;Ray Mears&#x27; Bushcraft&quot;, &quot;Ray Mears&#x27; World of Survival&quot;, &quot;Extreme Survival&quot;, &quot;Survival with Ray Mears&quot;, &quot;Wild Britain with Ray Mears&quot; and &quot;Ray Mears Goes Walkabout&quot;.

==Early life==
Mears grew up on the North Downs, in Southern England. He attended Downside Preparatory School in Purley and then Reigate Grammar School, where he was a member of the Royal Navy section of the Combined Cadet Force.

Mears&#x27;s ambition was to join the Royal Marines, but he could not meet the eyesight requirements for entry. After taking A-levels, Mears briefly worked in an office in the City of London.

==Career==
In 1983, Mears founded Woodlore, a company that offers bushcraft-related courses and paraphernalia. It became so successful that it soon led to the trademarking of the name &quot;Ray Mears&quot;. Mears first appeared on television in 1994 presenting the BBC series &quot;Tracks&quot; and then, in 1997, &quot;Ray Mears&#x27; World of Survival&quot;. In 2003, he presented the BBC documentary &quot;Ray Mears&#x27; Real Heroes of Telemark&quot; about the Norwegian heavy water sabotage mission during World War II.

In 2003, Mears won The Ness Award.

While filming a documentary in Wyoming, US in 2005, Mears was involved in a serious accident. The helicopter in which he and his camera crew were travelling hit the ground during a steep low level turn, and broke apart, rolling to a stop. The fuel tank was ruptured in the accident and escaping fuel covered Mears and the crew. No fire occurred, and Mears was able to escape the wreckage uninjured and assist in the rescue and administer first aid to one of the crew who was badly hurt.

In 2009, Mears was approached by ITV to present a planned revival of the nature documentary series &quot;Survival&quot;. The resulting three-part series was rebranded &quot;Survival with Ray Mears&quot; and broadcast on ITV1 in 2010. Each episode followed Mears as he used his tracking skills to locate bears, wolves and leopards.

In a &quot;Radio Times&quot; interview to promote the series, Mears complained of being typecast by the BBC with the result that he was not offered the opportunity to present wildlife programmes. Mears was a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in January 2014.

In 2009, he was awarded the prestigious Mungo Park Medal.

In July 2010, Mears was asked by Northumbria Police to help them track fugitive killer Raoul Moat, after he fled his temporary tent-based shelter in the village of Rothbury.

Between 2010 and 2013 he presented three series of &quot;Wild Britain&quot; on ITV. The first series consisted of six 45 minute episodes, while series two and three had ten episodes of programmes lasting half an hour. Each programme would see Mears visit a different habitat in a different part of the country. The programme was a rating success, regularly featuring in the top 30 watched programmes of the week.

2013 also saw Mears write &quot;My Outdoor Life&quot;, which was a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller.

In 2014, he presented &quot;Wilderness Walks&quot;, where he visited six areas of natural beauty across the United Kingdom. Each episode would see Mears spend day in a location exploring the local wildlife and offering advice on how to find wild food and make the most of natural resources. In 2015 he presented &quot;Wild River&quot;, a one-off episode where he explores the wildlife around the River Wye.

2016 saw him present &quot;Wild Australia&quot; where he explored the wildlife of several locations both on land and in the sea, coming across several iconic Australian species, such as the Red Kangaroo and Platypus. He then presented six episodes of &quot;Wild France&quot;, travelling around the country and looking at its wildlife. Following the same format as his previous series, each programme focused on a different environment. He returned to Australia in 2017, presenting the seven part-series &quot;Australian Wilderness&quot; with Ray Mears.

In 2021, he presented &quot;Wild China with Ray Mears&quot;, a seven part series, where he visited a range of habitats and looked at several iconic animals, including Snow Leopards and Giants Pandas.

==Personal life==
Mears met his first wife, Rachel, in 1992 when she attended one of his five-day survival courses. The couple lived in Eastbourne, East Sussex with her two adult children and married in 2005, after Rachel was diagnosed with breast cancer. Rachel died in 2006, aged 50, and her ashes are scattered in Ashdown Forest near their home.

Mears married again in 2009 to Ruth. They live in Sussex with her stepson.

In 2019 he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of York&#x27;s archaeology department for &quot;...his excellent representation of craft, the wilderness and public outreach.&quot;

<text>Toward the Within is the first live album by Australian band Dead Can Dance, released on 24 October 1994 by 4AD. It contains 15 songs, of which only four appeared on their previous albums, and two of which were later re-recorded and included on Lisa Gerrard&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Mirror Pool&quot;. The others previously existed only in live performances and unofficial bootlegs, but were not officially released until &quot;Toward the Within&quot;. Along with Perry and Gerrard were a number of musicians who had performed with them on other occasions.

== Overview ==
&quot;Toward the Within&quot; was recorded in one take in November 1993 at the Mayfair Theatre in Santa Monica, California and was released by 4AD as an album and a video (VHS and LaserDisc) a year later. It was the last major event to take place in the Mayfair Theatre before it was severely damaged in the Northridge earthquake in January 1994 and had to be closed indefinitely. The video was filmed by producer Mark Magidson, known for his work on the 1992 film &quot;Baraka&quot;. It contains interviews with Gerrard and Perry, as well as a music video for &quot;Yulunga (Spirit Dance)&quot;, composed of clips from &quot;Baraka&quot;.

While the CD functions as the soundtrack to the video, neither contain the entire show. The CD lacks &quot;Gloridean&quot; as well as the song played over the ending credits of the video, while the video lacks &quot;Persian Love Song&quot; and concert footage of &quot;Yulunga (Spirit Dance)&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;Toward the Within&quot; was re-released on DVD and included in the box set &quot;Dead Can Dance (1981-1998)&quot;. In addition to the original content, the DVD release contained a few extras: a discography; music videos for &quot;Frontier&quot;, &quot;The Protagonist&quot; and &quot;The Carnival Is Over&quot;; and a chapter from &quot;Baraka&quot; titled &quot;Calcutta Foragers/Homeless&quot;, which is set to Dead Can Dance&#x27;s &quot;The Host of Seraphim&quot;. In 2004, the DVD was released in a stand-alone package.

== Track listing ==

Songs composed by Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, except as noted

Note: &quot;Persian Love Song&quot; is based on an ancient Persian song, later re-recorded by Lisa Gerrard and released in 1995 on her solo album &quot;The Mirror Pool&quot;. The same song was used by David Sylvian as an introduction to &quot;Nostalgia&quot; (from the &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; album), a 20-second sample from the song &quot;The Silver Gun&quot; taken from &quot;Persian Love Song &amp; Mystic Chants&quot;, an album released in 1971 by Shusha Guppy, although Sylvian did not specify that in the album credits.
&quot;I Am Stretched on Your Grave&quot; is based on an anonymous 17th century poem. Sinéad O&#x27;Connor performed the song in a traditional style over a hip hop drum beat on her 1990 album &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#x27;t Got&quot;.

<doc id="1195861" wikidata="Q410374" url="?curid=1195861" title="Papaverine">
<text>Papaverine (Latin &quot;papaver&quot;, &quot;poppy&quot;) is an opium alkaloid antispasmodic drug, used primarily in the treatment of visceral spasms and vasospasms (especially those involving the intestines, heart, or brain), occasionally in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and acute mesenteric ischemia. While it is found in the opium poppy, papaverine differs in both structure and pharmacological action from the analgesic morphine and its derivatives (such as codeine).

In addition to opium, papaverine is purported to be present in high concentrations in star gooseberry.

== History ==

Papaverine was discovered in 1848 by Georg Merck (1825–1873). Merck was a student of the German chemists Justus von Liebig and August Hofmann, and he was the son of Emanuel Merck (1794–1855), founder of the Merck corporation, a major German chemical and pharmaceutical company.

== Uses ==
Papaverine is approved to treat spasms of the gastrointestinal tract, bile ducts and ureter and for use as a cerebral and coronary vasodilator in subarachnoid hemorrhage (combined with balloon angioplasty) and coronary artery bypass surgery. Papaverine may also be used as a smooth muscle relaxant in microsurgery where it is applied directly to blood vessels.

Papaverine is used as an erectile dysfunction drug, alone or sometimes in combination. Papaverine, when injected in penile tissue, causes direct smooth muscle relaxation and consequent filling of the corpus cavernosum with blood resulting in erection. A topical gel is also available for ED treatment.

It is also commonly used in cryopreservation of blood vessels along with the other glycosaminoglycans and protein suspensions. Functions as a vasodilator during cryopreservation when used in conjunction with verapamil, phentolamine, nifedipine, tolazoline or nitroprusside.

Papaverine is also being investigated as a topical growth factor in tissue expansion with some success.

Papaverine is used as an off-label prophylaxis (preventative) of migraine headaches. It is not a first line drug such as a few beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and some anticonvulsants such as divalproex, but rather when these first line drugs and secondary drugs such as SSRIs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, etc. fail in the prophylaxis of migraines, have intolerable side effects or are contraindicated.

Papaverine is also present in combinations of opium alkaloid salts such as papaveretum (Omnopon, Pantopon) and others, along with morphine, codeine, and in some cases noscapine and others in a percentage similar to that in opium, or modified for a given application.

Papaverine is found as a contaminant in some heroin and can be used by forensic laboratories in heroin profiling to identify its source. The metabolites can also be found in the urine of heroin users, allowing street heroin to be distinguished from pharmaceutical diacetylmorphine.

==Mechanism==
The &quot;in vivo&quot; mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but an inhibition of the enzyme phosphodiesterase causing elevation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels is significant. It may also alter mitochondrial respiration.

Papaverine has also been demonstrated to be a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the PDE10A subtype found mainly in the striatum of the brain. When administered chronically to mice, it produced motor and cognitive deficits and increased anxiety, but conversely may produce an antipsychotic effect, although not all studies support this view.

== Side effects ==
Frequent side effects of papaverine treatment include polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, constipation, interference with sulphobromophthalein retention test (used to determine hepatic function), increased transaminase levels, increased alkaline phosphatase levels, somnolence, and vertigo.

Rare side effects include flushing of the face, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), cutaneous eruption, arterial hypotension, tachycardia, loss of appetite, jaundice, eosinophilia, thrombopenia, mixed hepatitis, headache, allergic reaction, chronic active hepatitis, and paradoxical aggravation of cerebral vasospasm.

Papaverine in the plant Sauropus androgynus is linked to bronchiolitis obliterans.

== Formulations and trade names==
Papaverine is available in its salt form as the hydrochloride, codecarboxylate, adenylate, and teprosylate. It was also once available as a salt of hydrobromide, camsylate, cromesilate, nicotinate, and phenylglycolate. The hydrochloride salt is available for intramuscular, intravenous, rectal and oral administration. The teprosylate is available in intravenous, intramuscular, and orally administered formulations. The codecarboxylate is available in oral form, only, as is the adenylate.

The codecarboxylate is sold under the name Albatran, the adenylate as Dicertan, and the hydrochloride salt is sold variously as Artegodan (Germany), Cardioverina (countries outside Europe and the United States), Dispamil (countries outside Europe and the United States), Opdensit (Germany), Panergon (Germany), Paverina Houde (Italy, Belgium), Pavacap (United States), Pavadyl (United States), Papaverine (Israel), Papaverin-Hamelin (Germany), Paveron (Germany), Spasmo-Nit (Germany), Cardiospan, Papaversan, Cepaverin, Cerespan, Drapavel, Forpaven, Papalease, Pavatest, Paverolan, Therapav (Canada), Vasospan, Cerebid, Delapav, Dilaves, Durapav, Dynovas, Optenyl, Pameion, Papacon, Pavabid, Pavacen, Pavakey, Pavased, Pavnell, Alapav, Myobid, Vasal, Pamelon, Pavadel, Pavagen, Ro-Papav, Vaso-Pav, Papanerin-hcl, Qua bid, Papital T.R., Paptial T.R., Pap-Kaps-150. In Hungary, papaverine and homatropine methylbromide are used in mild drugs that help &quot;flush&quot; the bile.

<text>The culture of Germany has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular.

==Language==

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany. It is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission, along with English and French. Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Sorbian, 
North Frisian and 
Saterland Frisian, with Low German being a regional language. They are officially protected by the ECRML. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Kurdish, Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian.

Standard German is a West Germanic language and is closely related to and classified alongside English, Dutch, and the Frisian languages. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the East (extinct) and North Germanic languages. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as Denglisch). German is written using the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with Umlaut, namely ä, ö, and ü, as well as the Eszett or &quot;scharfes S&quot; (&quot;sharp s&quot;) which is written &quot;ß&quot; (not used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, where it is written &quot;ss&quot; instead). German orthography has gone through a series of reforms, the most recent in 1996.

German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German. German dialects are traditional local varieties and can be traced back to the different German tribes. Many of them are not easily understandable to a speaker of standard German, since they often differ in lexicon, phonology, and syntax.

Around the world, German has approximately 100 million native speakers and also about 80 million non-native speakers. German is the main language of about 90 million people (18%) in the EU. 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language, 27% in at least two languages other than their first.

In the German diaspora, aspects of German culture are passed on to younger generations through naming customs and through the use of spoken and written German. The Goethe Institute seeks to spread the knowledge of German culture worldwide. A total of 15.5 million people are currently learning German as a second language.

==Literature==

German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages, with the most notable authors of the period being Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach.
The , whose author remains unknown, is also an important work of the epoch, as is the &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot;. The fairy tales collections collected and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.

&quot;Land der Dichter und Denker&quot; (&quot;Land of poets and thinkers&quot;) is a phrase used by many Germans to refer to Germany, though it is hardly known in non-German-speaking countries. It is occasionally used to describe certain cities as well (&quot;Stadt der Dichter und Denker&quot;), such as Tübingen and Jena.

Theologian Luther, who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern &quot;High German&quot; language.

Among the most admired German philosophers and authors are Lessing, Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, Hoffmann, Brecht, Heine and Schmidt. Nine Germans have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: Theodor Mommsen, Paul von Heyse, Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Nelly Sachs, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Böll, Günter Grass, and Herta Müller.

==Philosophy==

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.

German philosophers have helped shape western philosophy from as early as the Middle Ages (Albertus Magnus). Later, Leibniz (17th century) and most importantly Kant played central roles in the history of philosophy. Kantianism inspired the work of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche as well as German idealism defended by Fichte and Hegel. Marx and Engels developed communist theory in the second half of the 19th century while Heidegger and Gadamer pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in sociology, most notably Adorno, Elias, Habermas, Horkheimer, Luhmann, Marcuse, Simmel, Tönnies, and Weber. The University of Berlin founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.

In the 21st century Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.

== Music ==

In the field of music, Germany claims some of the most renowned classical composers of the world, including Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, who marked the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western classical music. Also, Germans developed many Lutheran chorales and hymns.

Other composers of the Austro-German tradition who achieved international fame include Brahms, Wagner, Haydn, Johann Pachelbel, Schubert, Händel, Schumann, Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Johann Strauss II, Bruckner, Mahler, Telemann, Richard Strauss, Schoenberg, Orff, and most recently, Henze, Lachenmann, and Stockhausen.

Germany is the largest music market in Europe, and third largest in the world. It has exerted a strong influence on rock and heavy metal music. Artists such as Herbert Grönemeyer, Scorpions, Blind Guardian, Rammstein, Nena, Unheilig, Xavier Naidoo, Tokio Hotel and Modern Talking have enjoyed international fame. 

German musicians have contributed heavily to developments in electronic music, in synth-pop, electronic body music, trance and hardcore. Krautrock band Kraftwerk are considered to be the pioneers of synth-pop, electro, techno, and house music. Tangerine Dream&#x27;s &quot;Love on a Real Train&quot; was a major influence on the development of synthwave.

German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle (Nena, Alphaville), Ostrock (City, Keimzeit), metal/rock, punk (Nina Hagen, Böhse Onkelz, Die Ärzte, Die Toten Hosen), pop rock (Beatsteaks), indie (Tocotronic, Blumfeld) and hip hop (Die Fantastischen Vier, Deichkind). A global trendsetter is the German techno and minimal scene (e.g. Ricardo Villalobos, Paul Kalkbrenner and Sven Väth).

Germany hosts many large rock music festivals every year. The Rock am Ring festival is the largest music festival in Germany, and among the largest in the world. German artists also make up a large percentage of industrial and Neue Deutsche Härte acts. Germany hosts some of the largest goth or dark culture scenes and festivals in the entire world, with events like Wave-Gotik-Treffen and M&#x27;era Luna Festival attracting up to 30,000 people. In addition, the country hosts Wacken Open Air, the biggest heavy metal open air festival in the world.

Since about 1970, Germany has once again had a thriving popular culture, now increasingly led by its reinstated capital Berlin, and a self-confident music and art scene. Germany is also very well known for its many renowned opera houses, such as Semperoper, Komische Oper Berlin and Munich State Theatre. Richard Wagner established the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

One of the most famous composers of the international film business is Hans Zimmer. The year 2020 was designated &quot;Beethoven Year&quot; to mark 250 years since the composer was born.

==Cinema==
German cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the work of Max Skladanowsky. It was particularly influential during the years of the Weimar Republic with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Austrian-based director Fritz Lang, who became a German citizen in 1926 and whose career flourished in the pre-war German film industry, is said to have been a major influence on Hollywood cinema. His silent movie Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the birth of modern Science Fiction movies.
Founded in 1912, the Babelsberg Film Studio is the oldest large-scale film studio in the world.

In 1930, Josef von Sternberg directed &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, which was the first major German sound film and it brought world fame to actress Marlene Dietrich. Impressionist documentary , directed by Walter Ruttmann, is a prominent example of the city symphony genre. The Nazi era produced mostly propaganda films although the work of Leni Riefenstahl still introduced new aesthetics to film.

During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schlöndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder put West German cinema back on the international stage with their often provocative films.

More recently, films such as &quot;Good Bye Lenin!&quot; (2003), &quot;Gegen die Wand (Head-on)&quot; (2004), &quot;Der Untergang (Downfall)&quot; (2004), and &quot;Der Baader Meinhof Komplex&quot; (2008) have enjoyed international success.

The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film went to the German production &quot;Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum)&quot; in 1979, to &quot;Nowhere in Africa&quot; in 2002, and to &quot;Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others)&quot; in 2007. Among the most famous German actors are Marlene Dietrich, Klaus Kinski, Hanna Schygulla, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Jürgen Prochnow, Thomas Kretschmann, Til Schweiger and Daniel Brühl.

The Berlin Film Festival, held annually since 1951, is one of the world&#x27;s foremost film festivals. An international jury places emphasis on representing films from all over the world and awards the winners with the Golden and Silver Bears. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every second year in the city of Berlin, where the European Film Academy (EFA) is located. The Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam are the oldest large-scale film studios in the world and a centre for international film production.

==Media==

Germany&#x27;s television market is the largest in Europe, with 34,000,000 TV households.
The many regional and national public broadcasters are organised in line with the federal political structure. Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, and viewers can choose from a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels. Pay-TV services have not become popular or successful while public TV broadcasters ZDF and ARD offer a range of digital-only channels. Reality TV is the most popular programming in Germany and a key part in modern German culture.

Germany is home to some of the world&#x27;s largest media conglomerates, including Bertelsmann, the Axel Springer AG and ProSiebenSat.1 Media.

The German-speaking book publishers produce about 700,000,000 copies of books every year, with about 80,000 titles, nearly 60,000 of them new publications. Germany is in third place on international statistics after the English-speaking book market and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Frankfurt Book Fair is considered to be the most important book fair in the world for international deals and trading and has a tradition that spans over 500 years.

Many of Europe&#x27;s best-selling newspapers and magazines are produced in Germany. The papers with the highest circulation are &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Die Welt&quot;, the largest magazines include &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;Stern&quot; and &quot;Focus&quot;. The &quot;Bild&quot; is a tabloid and has the largest circulation of all German papers.

However, the publishing industry is in flux – amongst other things because meanwhile almost 800,000 newspaper copies sold daily are distributed digitally and the number of digital subscriptions is continually rising. Nevertheless, a total of around 38 million people in Germany still read a printed newspaper every day, while around 14.6 million make use of newspapers’ digital offerings.

==Architecture and World Heritage==

Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, important precursors of Romanesque. The region has also produced significant works in styles such as the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque.

The nation was particularly important in the early modern movement through the Deutscher Werkbund and the Bauhaus movement identified with Walter Gropius. The Nazis closed these movements and favoured a type of neo-classicism. Since World War II post-modern structures have been built. Since the reunification of Germany the trend has continued.

The UNESCO inscribed 54 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.

==Art==

German art has a long and distinguished tradition in the visual arts, from the earliest known work of figurative art to its current output of contemporary art. Celtic art and Germanic art both partially originated in Germany.

Carolingian and Ottonian art played a role in the origin of Romanesque art.

Important German Renaissance painters include Albrecht Altdorfer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Matthias Grünewald, Hans Holbein the Younger and the well-known Albrecht Dürer. The most important Baroque artists from Germany are Cosmas Damian Asam. Further artists are the painter Anselm Kiefer, romantic Caspar David Friedrich, the surrealist Max Ernst, the conceptualist Joseph Beuys, or Wolf Vostell or the neo-expressionist Georg Baselitz.

Within modern day society, contemporary art is a large aspect of the culture. This large community draws in people from all around the world. There are around 500 galleries in Germany that caters to this modern form of art. Art Cologne is a popular fair that displays contemporary art.

== Politics ==

Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the (Federal Diet) and (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the and the ; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.

The president, who has been Frank-Walter Steinmeier since 2017, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the . The chancellor, who has been Olaf Scholz since 2021, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German , though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.

A global opinion poll for the BBC revealed that Germany is recognized for having the most positive influence in the world in 2011, 2013, and 2014.

==Religion==

Christianity was introduced to the area of modern Germany by 300 AD and became fully Christianized by the time of Charlemagne in the eighth and ninth century. After the Reformation started by Martin Luther in the early 16th century, many people left the Catholic Church and became Protestant, mainly Lutheran and Calvinist. 59.4% of the German population belongs to Christian denominations: 30% are Roman Catholic, and 29% are affiliated with Protestantism (the figures are known accurately because Germany imposes a church tax on those who disclose a religious affiliation).
The north and east are predominantly Protestant, the south and west predominantly Catholic. Nowadays there is a non-religious majority in Hamburg and the former East German states. Germany was, at one point, almost in its entirety within the Roman Catholic Holy Roman Empire, but was also the source of Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther. During the Kulturkampf (from about 1872 to 1886) the government opposed the Catholic church.

Historically, Germany had a substantial Jewish population. Only a few thousand people of Jewish origin remained in Germany after the Holocaust, but the German Jewish community now has about 100,000 members, many from the former Soviet Union. Germany also has a substantial Muslim population, most of whom are descendants of Turkish workers from Turkey.

German theologians include Luther, Melanchthon, Schleiermacher, Feuerbach, and Rudolf Otto. Germany was also the origin of many mystics, including Meister Eckhart and Jakob Boehme; and of Pope Benedict XVI.

==Holidays and celebrations==
There are a number of public holidays in Germany. The country is particularly known for its Oktoberfest celebrations in Munich, its carnival culture and globally influential Christmas customs known as Weihnachten. 3 October has been the national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the German Unity Day (&quot;Tag der Deutschen Einheit&quot;).

==Science==
Germany has been the home of many famous inventors and engineers, such as Johannes Gutenberg, who is credited with the invention of movable type printing in Europe; Hans Geiger, the creator of the Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first computer. German inventors, engineers and industrialists such as Zeppelin, Lilienthal, Daimler, Diesel, Otto, Wankel, von Braun and Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology including the beginnings of space travel.

The work of Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Werner Heisenberg was crucial to the foundation of modern physics. They were preceded by such key physicists as Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer, and Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit, among others. Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovered X-rays, an accomplishment that earned him the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. Before World War II, Germany had produced more Nobel laureates in scientific fields than any other nation, and was the preeminent country in the natural sciences. Germany is currently the nation with the 3rd most Nobel Prize winners, 115. The Walhalla temple for &quot;laudable and distinguished Germans&quot; features a number of scientists, and is located east of Regensburg, in Bavaria.

Germany is home to some of the finest academic centers in Europe. Some famous universities are those of Munich and Berlin, University of Tübingen, University of Göttingen, University of Marburg, University of Berlin, Mining Academy Freiberg and Freiburg University, among many others. Moreover, the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg is one of the oldest universities in Europe.

==Fashion and design==
German designers were leaders of modern product design, with the Bauhaus designers like Mies van der Rohe, and Dieter Rams of Braun being essential.

Germany is a leading country in the fashion industry. The German textile industry consisted of about 1,300 companies with more than 130,000 employees in 2010, which generated a revenue of 28 billion Euro. Almost 44 percent of the products are exported. The textile branch thus is the second largest producer of consumer goods after food production in the country. Berlin is the center of young and creative fashion in Germany, prominently displayed at Berlin Fashion Week (twice a year). It also hosts Europe&#x27;s largest fashion trade fair called Bread &amp; Butter.

Munich, Hamburg and Düsseldorf are also important design and production hubs of the German fashion industry, among smaller towns. Renowned fashion designers from Germany include Karl Lagerfeld, Jil Sander, Wolfgang Joop, Philipp Plein and Michael Michalsky. Important brands include Hugo Boss, Escada and Triumph, as well as special outfitters like Adidas, PUMA and Jack Wolfskin. The German supermodels Claudia Schiffer, Heidi Klum, Tatjana Patitz and Nadja Auermann came to global fame.

== Cuisine ==

German cuisine varies from region to region. The southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, for instance, share a culinary culture with Switzerland and Austria, like the Schnitzel. Pork, beef, and poultry are the main varieties of meat consumed in Germany; pork is the most popular. Throughout all regions, meat is often eaten in sausage form. More than 1,500 different types of sausage are produced in Germany. Organic food has gained a market share of almost 6%, and this is predicted to increase further.

A popular German saying has the meaning: &quot;Breakfast like an emperor, lunch like a king, and dine like a beggar.&quot; Breakfast is usually a selection of breads and rolls with jam and honey or cold cuts and cheese, sometimes accompanied by a boiled egg. Cereals or muesli with milk or yoghurt is less common but widespread. More than 3000 types of bread are sold in bakery shops across the country. Occasionally, more traditional and heartier Breakfasts, like the Bavarian &quot;Brotzeit&quot; with Weisswurst, Sweet Mustard and Wheat beer, or the Bauernfrühstück are also popular.

It is customary for Germans to have a very large lunch around noon. A typical lunch usually consists of some type of meat or fish, a heavy carb such as potato or German noodles, and a side of vegetables. Due to the increasing number of Germans who work in urban centers, however, many more people are eating simple items on-the-go for lunch such as Currywurst, a go-to quick meal to pick up that consists of small pieces of sausage, french fries, and a spicy ketchup sauce.

The term for dinner in German is Abendbrot which directly translates to &quot;evening bread&quot;. As the name suggests, typically Germans will have a lighter dinner that consists of sliced meat, sausages, bread, and cheeses. Also, most dinners eaten by Germans usually include some form of mustard and pickles. The habit of having a simple, light dinner has become less of an everyday routine for many Germans. Due to the increasing number of people who work all day, it is difficult for many Germans to make the time to have a large lunch. For this reason, larger dinners have become more common. Although, most families still have Abendbrot at least a few times a week.

As a country with many immigrants, Germany has adopted many international dishes into its cuisine and daily eating habits. Italian dishes like pizza and pasta, Turkish and Arab dishes like döner kebab and falafel, are well established, especially in bigger cities. International burger chains, as well as Chinese and Greek restaurants, are widespread. Indian, Thai, Japanese, and other Asian cuisines have gained popularity in recent decades.
Among high-profile restaurants in Germany, the Michelin guide has awarded ten restaurants three stars, the highest designation, while 38 more received two stars and 255 one star. German restaurants have become the world&#x27;s second most decorated eateries after France.

Although German wine is becoming more popular in many parts of Germany, the national alcoholic drink is beer. In over 1.500 breweries more than 5.000 types of beer are produced. German beer consumption per person is declining but—at 116 litres annually—it is still among the highest in the world. Beer varieties include Alt, Bock, Dunkel, Kölsch, Lager, Malzbier, Pils, and Weizenbier. Among 18 surveyed western countries, Germany ranked 14th in the list of per capita consumption of soft drinks in general, while it ranked third in the consumption of fruit juices. Furthermore, carbonated mineral water and &quot;Schorle&quot; (its mixture with fruit juice or wine) are very popular in Germany.

== Gaming ==

Germany is filled with inventors of board games, also known as Eurogames, that are played around the world. Popular games include The Settlers of Catan, which features hexagonal resource tiles that generate resources according to the roll of two dice, and Carcassonne with its randomly drawn square tiles that eventually make a medieval map and its notability for its meeples. The fervor for new games continued with Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, and Alhambra. In 2008, Germany imported the popular card game Dominion from the US. Today, Germany publishes more board games than any other country per capita.

The German video gaming market is one of the largest in the world. The Gamescom in Cologne is the world&#x27;s leading gaming convention. Popular game series from Germany include &quot;Turrican&quot;, the &quot;Anno&quot; series, &quot;The Settlers&quot; series, the &quot;Gothic&quot; series, &quot;SpellForce&quot;, the &quot;X&quot; series, the &quot;FIFA Manager&quot; series, &quot;Far Cry&quot; and &quot;Crysis&quot;. The most relevant game developers and publishers are Blue Byte, Crytek, Deck13, Deep Silver, Daedalic Entertainment, Egosoft, Kalypso Media, Koch Media, Piranha Bytes, Related Designs and Yager Development. Bigpoint, Gameforge, Goodgame, Quake III Arena / Defrag and Wooga are leading developers of online and social games.

==Sports==

Sport forms an integral part of German life. 27,000,000 Germans are members of a sports club and an additional 12,000,000 pursue such an activity individually. Association football is the most popular sport. With more than 6,300,000 official members, the German Football Association (&quot;Deutscher Fußball-Bund&quot;) is the largest sports organisation of its kind worldwide. The Bundesliga attracts the second-highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world. The Germany national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014 and the UEFA European Football Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996. Germany has hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1974 and 2006 and the UEFA European Football Championship in 1988. Amongst the most successful and renowned footballers are: Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Jürgen Klinsmann, Lothar Matthäus, and Oliver Kahn. Other popular spectator sports include handball, volleyball, basketball, ice hockey, and tennis.

Germany is one of the leading motorsports countries in the world. Race-winning cars, teams and drivers have come from Germany. One of the most successful Formula One drivers in history, Michael Schumacher, set many significant motorsport records during his career, winning seven Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championships and 91 Formula One race wins, making him the most gilded driver since Formula One&#x27;s debut season in 1950. He is one of the highest paid sportsmen in history and became a billionaire athlete. Sebastian Vettel, another German Formula One pilot, later became the youngest Formula One World Champion in history and went on to win four consecutive world championship titles. He still holds records for the highest number of consecutive race wins and most pole positions in a single season. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are among the leading manufacturers in motorsport. Additionally, Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a prestigious annual endurance race held in France, 16 times, and Audi has won it 9 times. The Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters is a popular series in Germany.

Historically, German sportsmen have been some of the most successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count, combining East and West German medals. In the 2016 Summer Olympics, Germany finished fifth in the medal count, while in the 2018 Winter Olympics they finished second. Germany has hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice, in Berlin in 1936 and in Munich in 1972. The Winter Olympic Games took place in Germany once in 1936 when they were staged in the Bavarian twin towns of Garmisch and Partenkirchen.

==Society==

Germany is a modern, advanced society, shaped by a plurality of lifestyles and regional identities. The country has established a high level of gender equality, promotes disability rights, and is legally and socially tolerant towards homosexuals. Gays and lesbians can legally adopt their partner&#x27;s biological children, and same-sex marriage has been permitted since 2017. The former Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle and the former mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, are openly gay.

During the last decade of the twentieth century, Germany&#x27;s attitude towards immigrants changed. Until the mid-1990s, the opinion was widespread that Germany was not a country of immigration, even though about 20% of the population were of non-German origin. Today the government and a majority of the German society are acknowledging that immigrants from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds are part of German society and that controlled immigration should be initiated based on qualification standards.

Since the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the internal and external evaluation of Germany&#x27;s national image has changed. In the annual Nation Brands Index global survey, Germany became significantly and repeatedly more highly ranked after the tournament. People in 20 different states assessed the country&#x27;s reputation in terms of culture, politics, exports, its people and its attractiveness to tourists, immigrants and investments. Germany has been named the world&#x27;s second most valued nation among 50 countries in 2010. Another global opinion poll, for the BBC, revealed that Germany is recognised for the most positive influence in the world in 2010. A majority of 59% have a positive view of the country, while 14% have a negative view.

With an expenditure of €67 billion on international travel in 2008, Germans spent more money on travel than any other country. The most visited destinations were Spain, Italy and Austria. Additionally, tourism analysts estimate that over 65 percent of Germans vacationed for 5 or more days in 2007. The large amount of travel that Germans partake in can also be attributed to the amount of vacation days they receive. In Germany, employees are given a minimum of 24 vacation days annually, but often employers will give between 25 and 30 paid vacation days. Germans also like packaged vacations which can be all-inclusive vacations or pre-booked excursions or reservations. In 2018, 43% of all German travel consisted of packaged vacations.

== Leisure ==
In Germany, leisure is considered a quintessential part of the culture. Researchers in Hamburg concluded that Germans over 14 years old have an average of 4 hours of leisure time per day. Regardless of many factors that differentiate Germans, across the board, the most popular leisure activity is watching television. Most Germans dedicate their Sundays to leisure activity because a majority of shops and restaurants are closed on Sundays.

Sports clubs are a large part of Germans&#x27; leisure time. Currently, around 26 million people in Germany make up the membership to the over 91,000 sports clubs in Germany. Sports clubs can aid children and adults in getting to know people in their community through a shared passion for sports.

Another leisure activity that Germans like to partake in is exercise. Studies show that most Germans work out at least once a week in their free time.

<text>The Space Pen (also known as the Zero Gravity Pen), marketed by Fisher Space Pen Company, is a pen that uses pressurized ink cartridges and is able to write in zero gravity, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in a very wide range of temperatures.

==Inventors==
The Fisher Space Pen was created by Austrian Friedrich Schächter and expanded by Erwin Rath. Paul C. Fisher invented the &quot;thixotropic special ink&quot;. The pens are manufactured in Boulder City, Nevada. Paul C. Fisher first patented the AG7 &quot;anti-gravity&quot; pen in 1965.

==Models==
There are two prominent styles of the pen: the AG7 &quot;Astronaut pen&quot;, a long thin retractable pen shaped like a common ballpoint, and the &quot;Bullet pen&quot; which is non-retractable, shorter than standard ballpoints when capped, but full size when the cap is posted on the rear for writing.

Several of the Fisher Space Pen models (the &quot;Millennium&quot; is one) are claimed to write for a lifetime of &quot;average&quot; use; however, the product literature states that the pen will write exactly 30.7miles (). In contrast, the standard PR (Pressurized Refill) cartridge is rated to write for over 12,000feet ( or ).

Standard Space Pen refills can be used in any pen able to take a standard Parker-type ballpoint refill, using the small plastic adapter that is supplied with each refill. Fisher also makes a Space Pen-type refill that fits Cross pens, one that fits 1950s-style Paper Mate pens (or any pen that uses that type of refill), and a &quot;universal&quot; refill that fits some other ballpoint pens.

==Technology==
The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic visco-elastic ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is able to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly . Operating temperatures range from . The pen can write without the help of gravity, at any angle. The pen has an estimated shelf life of 100 years. 

One of the first Space Pen patents is US3285228, which was filed on 19 May 1965.

==Uses in the U.S. and Soviet space programs==

An urban legend states that NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in space (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviets just used pencils. In reality, NASA began to develop a space pen, but when development costs skyrocketed the project was abandoned and astronauts went back to using pencils, along with the Soviets. However, the claim that NASA spent millions on the Space Pen is incorrect, as the Fisher pen was developed using private capital, not government funding. The development of the thixotropic ink cost Paul Fisher around $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). NASA, and the Soviets, eventually began purchasing such pens.

NASA programs previously used pencils (as demonstrated by an order in 1965 for mechanical pencils) but because of the substantial dangers that broken pencil tips and graphite dust pose to electronics in zero gravity, the flammable nature of wood present in pencils, and the inadequate quality documentation produced by non-permanent or smeared recordkeeping, a better solution was needed. Soviet cosmonauts used pencils, and grease pencils on plastic slates until also adopting a space pen in 1969 with a purchase of 100 units for use on all future missions. NASA never approached Paul Fisher to develop a pen, nor did Fisher receive any government funding for the pen&#x27;s development. Fisher invented it independently and then, in 1965, asked NASA to try it. After extensive testing, NASA decided to use the pens in future Apollo missions. Subsequently, in 1967 it was reported that NASA purchased approximately 400 pens for $2.95 apiece (equivalent to $ each in ).

In 2008, Gene Cernan&#x27;s Apollo 17-flown space pen sold in a Heritage auction for US$23,900.

As of 2021, Fisher space pens were still being used on the International Space Station.

== In popular culture ==
* The 20th episode of season 3 of the comedy television show &quot;Seinfeld&quot; is called &quot;The Pen&quot; with a Space Pen featured as a major plot point.
* The Space Pen is featured in the 2009 Bollywood film &quot;3 Idiots&quot;, presented by the director of an engineering college to his students.

<text>Petrov&#x27;s Defence or the Petrov Defence (also called Petroff Defence, Petrov&#x27;s Game, Russian Defence, or Russian Game – ) is a chess opening characterised by the following moves:
:1. 
:2. 

Though this response has a long history, it was first popularised by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player in the mid-19th century. In recognition of the early investigations by the Russian masters Petrov and Carl Jaenisch, this opening is called the Russian Game in some countries.

The Petrov has a drawish reputation; however, it offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quite . Often a trade occurs and Black, after gaining a tempo, has a well-placed knight. Pillsbury&#x27;s game in 1895 against Emanuel Lasker testifies to this. The Black counterattack in the also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano (and other lines of the Italian Game), and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world&#x27;s leading players, including world champions Vasily Smyslov, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik, along with grandmaster Fabiano Caruana and others.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; codes for Petrov&#x27;s Defence are C43 (for 3.d4) and C42 (for all other lines).
==White&#x27;s third move==
White&#x27;s two main choices for move three are 3.Nxe5, the Classical Variation and 3.d4, the Steinitz Variation. 3.Nxe5 is more popular but they often lead to similar positions and &quot;there is no clear reason to prefer one move over the other&quot;.

3.Nc3 may transpose to the Four Knights Game. 3.Bc4 may lead to the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit or transpose to the Two Knights Defence. Occasionally seen is the 3.d3, the French Attack.

===Classical Variation: 3.Nxe5 ===

After 3.Nxe5, the Classical Variation, the standard reply for Black is 3...d6. 

====3...d6====
Most often, White follows the main line 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 (5.Bd3 is also playable, known as the Millennium Attack) d5 6.Bd3. White will try to drive Black&#x27;s advanced knight from e4 with moves like c4 and Re1. If White achieves this, then he is up two tempi (Nf6–e4–f6, plus the tempo White starts the game with). In practice White is usually able to achieve this, but at some structural cost such as having to play c4, which balances out. White can also force simplification with Lasker&#x27;s 5.Qe2 Qe7 6.d3. This is generally only good enough for a draw, which Black should be satisfied with. Another possibility, explored by Keres, is 5.c4, known as the Kauffmann Attack.

A completely different approach is to meet 4...Nxe4 with 5.Nc3 Nxc3 6.dxc3 with rapid and castling. For instance, White can plan a quick Be3, Qd2, and 0-0-0, and play for a attack, trusting that his doubled c-pawns will help protect his king, and that his initiative and attacking potential will offset the longterm disadvantage of having doubled pawns. In the 5.Nc3 line, Black must avoid 5...Bf5 6.Qe2! which wins a piece due to the pin (if 6...Qe7 7.Nd5, forcing 7...Qd7 because of the threat to the c7-pawn; then 8.d3 wins the piece). Viswanathan Anand resigned after only six moves after falling for this against Alonso Zapata at Biel in 1988.

The Cochrane Gambit, 4.Nxf7, is labelled &quot;speculative but entertaining&quot; by Nick de Firmian in &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;MCO&quot;) 14th edition. He evaluates the position in Veselin Topalov–Vladimir Kramnik, Linares 1999 as offering chances for both sides after 4...Kxf7 5.Nc3 c5!? 6.Bc4+ Be6 7.Bxe6+ Kxe6 8.d4 Kf7 9.dxc5 Nc6. 

The Paulsen Variation, 4.Nc4, is labelled &quot;ineffective&quot; by de Firmian in &quot;MCO&quot;, but is occasionally seen at grandmaster level. US master Andrew Karklins has experimented with 4.Nd3!?, now called the Karklins–Martinovsky Variation. This was played in the World Chess Championship 2018 between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana.

====Other replies====
3...Nxe4, the Damiano Variation, has traditionally been regarded as an error, though it has occasionally been seen in recent grandmaster play. Black must play accurately to avoid a serious disadvantage. After 4.Qe2 Black must avoid:
* 4...Nf6 5.Nc6+ winning the queen
* 4...d5 5.d3 Qe7 6.dxe4 Qxe5 7.exd5 and Black loses a pawn
* 4...d6? 5.Nxf7 Kxf7 6.Qxe4 and Black has lost a pawn and the ability to castle

Best is 4...Qe7 5.Qxe4 d6 6.d4 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nc6, and after 8.Nc3 Qxe5 9.Qxe5+ Nxe5 10.Nb5 (or 10.Bf4) White has the advantage. 

3...Qe7 is inferior, as 4.d4 d6 5.Nf3 Qxe4+ 6.Be2 gives White a large lead in development.
3... Nc6?!, recently dubbed the Stafford Gambit, is considered dubious, but it sets a number of traps, and in the early 2020s it became popular in online blitz and bullet games. After 4.Nxc6 dxc6, White wins a pawn but must play carefully. After 5.e5 (5.d3 is better) Ne4 6.d3?? (White should play 6.Nc3, 6.d4, or 6.Qe2) 6...Bc5! and White resigned in Lowens–Stafford, US correspondence game 1950. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 Nc6 4.Nxc6 dxc6 5.d3 Bc5, White must avoid the Légal Trap 6.Bg5?? Nxe4!, and if 7.Bxd8 (relatively best but still losing is 7.Be3) 7...Bxf2+ 8. Ke2 Bg4#. Instead White should play 6.Be2 Bc5 7.c3! with d3-d4 to follow, and Black has insufficient compensation for the pawn, though White must still play carefully.

===Steinitz Variation: 3.d4 ===


3.d4 was favoured by Wilhelm Steinitz, and is sometimes called the Steinitz Variation, although it was known earlier. Black can capture either pawn; also possible is 3...d6, transposing into the Philidor Defence.

After 3...exd4 4.e5 (4.Bc4 transposes into the Urusov Gambit) 4...Ne4 (4...Qe7?! 5.Be2 is better for White) 5.Qxd4 d5 6.exd6 Nxd6 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Qf4 the game is approximately . After the other capture, 3...Nxe4, 4.Bd3 d5 (4...Nc6!? 5.Bxe4 d5, intending 6.Bd3 e4, is also possible) 5.Nxe5, when either 5...Nd7 or 5...Bd6 gives roughly equal chances.

A long and complicated tactical sequence which has frequently been seen in master games is 3...Nxe4 4.Bd3 d5 5.Nxe5 Bd6 6.0-0 0-0 7.c4 Bxe5 8.dxe5 Nc6 9.cxd5 Qxd5 10.Qc2 Nb4 11.Bxe4 Nxc2 12.Bxd5 Bf5 13.g4 Bxg4 14.Be4 Nxa1 15.Bf4 f5 16.Bd5+ Kh8 17.Rc1 c6 18.Bg2 Rfd8 19.Nd2 () and White has the slightly better endgame after either 19...Rxd2 20.Bxd2 Rd8 21.Bc3 Rd1+ 22.Rxd1 Bxd1 or 19...h6 20.h4.
===Three Knights Game: 3.Nc3 ===
3.Nc3 is the Three Knights Game of Petrov&#x27;s Defence. It can also be reached via 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 (the Vienna Game). 3...Nc6 transposes to the Four Knights Game. With the reply 3...Bb4 (or some others), it remains the Three Knights Game proper.

===Italian Variation: 3.Bc4 ===
3.Bc4 is the Italian Variation of Petrov&#x27;s Defence. With 3...Nc6, it transposes to the Two Knights Defence.

====Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit====

Another possibility is 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3, the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit. It is not considered wholly sound, since Black has several viable options. Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, but must play carefully after 6.0-0 (for example 6...Bc5?? 7.Nxe5! is disastrous; 6...d6 and 6...Nc6 are good). Another more aggressive try is 6.Nh4, where White goes for a quick assault on Black&#x27;s king, but Black can maintain a small advantage if he plays cautiously via 6...g6 7.f4 Qe7 8.f5 Qg7 9.Qg4 Kd8. Another possibility is returning the gambit pawn with 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 c6 6.Nxe5 d5, which equalises. A third possibility is transposing to the Italian Four Knights Game with 4...Nc6, and if 5.Nxe4, 5...d5. If 5.Bxf7+?, then 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 gives Black the and control of the . If 5.0-0, Black plays 5...Nxc3 6.dxc3 and now Black can play 6...Qe7!, after which Bobby Fischer wrote that &quot;White has no compensation for the Pawn&quot;, or 6...f6 transposing to the main line of the Boden–Kieseritzky. Black also has lines beginning 6...Be7 and 6...h6.

<doc id="1195891" wikidata="Q3547409" url="?curid=1195891" title="USS John Adams (1799)">
<text>The first John Adams was originally built in 1799 as a frigate for the United States Navy, used as a stores ship/provisioning ship ordered to provide that service in May, 1804, converted to a corvette in 1809, and later converted back to a frigate in 1830. Named for American Founding Father and president John Adams, she fought in the Quasi-War, the First and Second Barbary Wars, the War of 1812, the Second Sumatran Expedition, the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. At the end of her career, she participated in the Union blockade of South Carolina&#x27;s ports.

==Origin==
&quot;John Adams&quot; was built for the United States by the people of Charleston, South Carolina, under contract to Paul Pritchard and launched in the latter&#x27;s shipyard some from Charleston 5 June 1799.

==Quasi-War==
Captain George Cross sailed &quot;John Adams&quot; on 20 October for Cayenne, French Guiana, to operate against French privateers based at that port. By the time she arrived off South America, the British had captured Surinam, which made the French base in Guiana unsafe for privateers. Captain Cross therefore decided to sail her on to Guadeloupe to join her squadron.

Early in January 1800, she began operations against the French, taking an unidentified lugger off San Juan, Puerto Rico and recapturing brig &quot;Dolphin&quot;. She then retook the brigs &quot;Hannibal&quot; on 22 March and &quot;Atlantic&quot; the next day, both prizes of the French privateer &quot;President Tout&quot;. The French privateer schooner &quot;Jason&quot; surrendered to her 3 April. In May she retook schooners &quot;Dispatch&quot; and &quot;William&quot;. Sometime in the late spring or summer she recaptured the American brig &quot;Olive&quot;, and on 13 June she took French privateer schooner &quot;La Decade&quot;. On 7 September she recaptured ship &quot;Seahorse&quot;. These victories punctuated and highlighted the day-to-day duty of patrolling the West Indies. She continued to protect American shipping through the late summer and fall.

&quot;John Adams&quot; left on 22 November escorting a convoy to the United States. She was placed in ordinary in Charleston in mid-January 1801, and then in late June she sailed to Washington, D.C. where she was laid up.

As the Quasi-War with France drew to a close, President Adams could report to Congress:

The present Navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence by a great national emergency, has raised us in our own esteem; and by the protection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our expectations the objects for which it was created.

==First Barbary War==
Peace with France freed the Navy for operations against Barbary corsairs who had been preying on American shipping in the Mediterranean. A small squadron under Commodore Richard Dale, sent out in 1801 for operations against Tripoli, was followed in 1802 by a much stronger force under Commodore Richard Valentine Morris. In a letter dated 25 August, 1802 Captain John Rodgers was ordered to take command. On 22 October she sailed from Hampton Roads to join Commodore Morris. She arrived at Gibraltar on 10 December. After escorting vessels from Gibraltar to Málaga and Menorca, she finally caught up with Commodore Morris at Malta on 5 January 1803. She then operated with the squadron until 3 May when she received orders to cruise independently off Tripoli. Upon arriving off Tripoli, 8-9 May, 1803, she, still under the command of Rodgers, boldly attacked the forts and the gunboats anchored under their protection. There was an exchange of fire with the gunboats the next day also. On 12 May she captured 28-gun former Tripolitan cruiser &quot;Meshuda&quot;, that had been transferred to Moroccan ownership while being blockaded at Gibraltar, while trying to run the blockade into Tripoli. After and joined her, &quot;John Adams&quot; engaged a flotilla of enemy gunboats off Tripoli on 22 May sending them scurrying back into the harbor to safety. Five days later—with the added support of , a sister frigate also named for President John Adams—the squadron again exchanged fire with group of Tripolitan forts and gunboats.

One of the most important victories of the war came on 21 June when &quot;John Adams&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; captured a 22-gun vessel belonging to Tripoli, thus weakening that state sufficiently to allow the squadron to turn its attention to Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco, which were threatening U.S. commerce in the Western Mediterranean. Throughout the summer and early fall &quot;John Adams&quot; operated in that quarter before returning home with New York. On 6 October, 1803 Capt. High Campbell took command. At the end of the brief war between the U. S. And Morocco, that had been started by the Governor of Tangier without permission of the Emperor of Morocco, Meshuda was returned to the Emperor of Morocco on 19 October, 1803. On 19 October she sailed for home. She arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on 11 December, 1803.

In March, 1804 she was fitting out for deployment to the Mediterranean and Lt. Isaac Chauncey was ordered to take command on 8 March. By 24 May, 1804 Chauncey had been promoted to Master Commandant. In a letter dated 29 May to Commodore Preble the Secretary of the Navy states that &quot;John Adams&#x27; is a stores/provisioning ship and should be constantly used as such unless an operation was about to happen that she could be useful for, but be detained as little as necessary. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 15 June, departing 25 June. Meanwhile, Commodore Edward Preble, who had led a powerful fleet to the Mediterranean, vigorously pressed the fight. In August and September 1804 he made a series of major attacks on Tripoli. As the second of these blows was being delivered 7 August, &quot;John Adams&quot;, now under Captain Isaac Chauncey, arrived on the scene deeply laden with stores. Her boats participated in a reconnaissance patrol on the night of 18 August, and 6 days later she slipped in close to the city for an intensive 4-hour bombardment. Two nights later during a similar attack, an enemy shot sank one of &quot;John Adams&quot;″s boats, killing three men and wounding a fourth, as the American Squadron severely punished Tripoli with over 700 well-directed rounds which took effect within the city. After a fifth attack had been successfully completed 3 September, bad weather interrupted operations and &quot;John Adams&quot; sailed to Syracuse with other ships of the squadron. 

Three months later she sailed for New York with Commodore Preble, arriving 26 February 1805. On 6 March 1805 Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith wrote to Captain Isaac Chauncey regarding recruitment of seamen for the frigate&#x27;s third voyage to the Mediterranean, he emphasized, the Navy wanted,&quot;active men who can fight.&quot; It is my wish to send to the Mediterranean as many men in the &quot;John Adams&quot; as she can conveniently carry thither. I want to send out 500 Men, of which number at least 200 must be Able Seamen. You will begin to recruit as soon as you conveniently can. Enter the men to serve 2 years (although it is probable they will not be kept in the Mediterranean for 2 years) allow Able Seamen $ 12 per month, Ordinary Seamen $ 8, Boys $ 6. Engage healthy, active men who can fight. Allow 2 to 4 months advance on customary security.

After a third Mediterranean cruise from May to November, she was laid up in ordinary. In service she had been considered a poor sailor; between 1807 and 1809 her forecastle and quarterdeck were removed and she was re-rated as (depending on the source) either a corvette or a sloop-of-war.

==War of 1812==
The outbreak of the War of 1812 found her undergoing repairs at Boston whence she was hurried to New York to have the work completed. There the British blockade and a critical shortage of seamen kept her in a laid-up status until early 1814. She finally sailed under a flag of truce carrying peace commissioners Henry Clay and Jonathan Russell to Europe and arrived Wargo Island, Norway, 14 April. She returned to the United States 5 September bringing dispatches from the American commissioners the Treaty of Ghent that would end the war towards the end of the year.

==Second Barbary War==
Meanwhile, the Barbary pirates, taking advantage of the American Navy&#x27;s preoccupation with the British fleet during the War of 1812, had resumed operations against American merchantmen in the Mediterranean. Fortunately the treaty of peace signed on Christmas Eve 1814 freed United States men-of-war for renewed attention to this chronic trouble spot. In the autumn of 1815 &quot;John Adams&quot; arrived in the Mediterranean to assist frigates and and sloops and in maintaining peace and order in the area after strong squadrons under Commodores Stephen Decatur and William Bainbridge had induced the Barbary princes to honor their treaty commitments. Early in 1816 she returned home with dispatches, and with marble from Naples for refurbishing the Capitol at Washington.

==West Indies==
Pirates were also active in the West Indies at this time. Taking advantage of the chaos attendant upon the dissolution of Spain&#x27;s American empire, lawless vessels from many nations preyed on neutral as well as Spanish commerce in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and along the storied Spanish Main. For the next few years &quot;John Adams&quot; was busy fighting buccaneers. On 22 December 1817 she demanded and received the surrender of Amelia Island, off the east coast of Florida, the base from which corsairs of Commodore Louis-Michel Aury pounced upon merchantmen of all nations.

==Venezuela==
In the spring of 1819 Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson selected Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry for the mission of establishing friendly relations with the government of newly independent Republic of Venezuela and Provinces United of Rio de La Plata and negotiating with the president Simon Bolivar to obtain restitution for United States schooners &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; that the Venezuelans patriots had illegally taken in the Orinoco river during the revolution. Perry boarded his flagship &quot;John Adams&quot; at Annapolis and sailed in company with schooner on 7 June. A month later he reached the mouth of the Orinoco, which he ascended to Angostura in &quot;Nonsuch&quot; while &quot;John Adams&quot; sailed on to Trinidad to await his return at Port of Spain. After protracted negotiation, the Vice President of Venezuela Francisco Antonio Zea granted all the demands of the United States on 11 August. However, during the passage down the river, Perry was stricken with yellow fever and died on board the &quot;John Adams&quot;.

Commodore Charles Morris succeeded Perry in command of the squadron and &quot;John Adams&quot; accompanied his flagship &quot;Constellation&quot; on a voyage to the Plata River to continue the negotiations inaugurated by Perry to establish friendly relations with the new Latin American republics and to protect American commerce from South American privateers. After visiting Montevideo and Buenos Aires, both ships returned to the United States, arriving Hampton Roads on 24 April 1820.

==1821–1845==
In spite of these successes, piracy remained rampant in the West Indies, and &quot;John Adams&quot; was part of a strong West Indies Squadron created in 1821 to cope with the problem. Nicholas Biddle&#x27;s ships labored with zeal; but the task, entailing careful searches by small-boat expeditions of innumerable bays, lagoons, and inlets, seemed endless. Yellow fever took a much heavier toll than the enemy necessitating reinforcements which arrived 3 March 1823 when Commodore David Porter&#x27;s &quot;Mosquito Fleet&quot; anchored off Saint Thomas. Porter, the squadron&#x27;s new commander, selected &quot;John Adams&quot; as his flagship. When Porter was recalled, his successor, Commodore Lewis Warrington retained &quot;John Adams&quot; as his flagship until 1826. From time to time, thereafter, the frigate returned to the West Indies for operations against pirates until 1829 when she was laid up and almost entirely rebuilt at the Navy Yard in Gosport, Virginia.

&quot;John Adams&quot; joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1831 as a frigate. One of her first duties was to take her former commander, ex-Commodore Porter, to Constantinople where he became the U.S.&#x27;s first chargé d&#x27;affaires. The ship was granted the rare privilege of passing through the Dardanelles with guns mounted. Thereafter, she convoyed ships in the Mediterranean and in 1833 visited Liberia.

After extensive repairs in the United States, &quot;John Adams&quot; sailed from Hampton Roads on 5 May 1838, accompanied by , on a cruise around the world. Particular stress was placed upon showing the flag in the East Indies where the United States enjoyed a prosperous and growing trade. Both ships arrived Rio de Janeiro 10 July but departed separately, &quot;John Adams&quot; sailing on 25 July. She stopped at Zanzibar en route to Bombay, where she rejoined &quot;Columbia&quot; before sailing on to Goa and Colombo, Ceylon.

At Colombo the ships learned that natives at Susoh (currently in Southwest Aceh Regency, Aceh, Indonesia) had attacked the American ship &quot;Eclipse&quot;. The squadron immediately sailed to the scene of the incident and bombarded the forts at Kuala Batee to induce the Rajahs of Sumatra to agree to offer assistance and protection to American vessels. They then landed over 300 marines and sailors to attack the village of Muckie, which they destroyed (Second Sumatran Expedition). Before returning to Rio de Janeiro on 23 April 1840, the squadron called at Singapore, Macau, Honolulu, Valparaíso, and Cape Horn.

==Mexican-American and Civil Wars==
&quot;John Adams&quot; finally arrived Boston about the middle of June where she was laid up until 1842. After duty on the Brazil Station, she went into ordinary where she remained until recommissioned at the beginning of the Mexican-U.S. War.

She was anchored off the bar at Santiago 8 May 1846 during the Battle of Palo Alto. She then maintained a blockading station off the east coast of Mexico for the remainder of the war. The prolonged period of time the John Adams spent on station off the Mexican coast in support of American military operations, may account for the increase in flogging as reflected in the surviving disciplinary reports for years, 1846–1847. 

&quot;John Adams&quot; returned to Boston in September 1848 and received extensive repairs before joining the Royal Navy for action against the slave trade around Africa. Rear Admiral Barrington Reynolds was the British Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope Station at the time. She returned from this difficult duty in July 1853. Thereafter, with the exception of periods at home for repairs, &quot;John Adams&quot; operated in the Pacific and the Far East until after the outbreak of the Civil War. She sailed for home from Siam 6 July 1861 and reached New York 11 January 1862, bringing a box containing two letters from the King of Siam to President Lincoln, along with a sword and a pair of ivory tusks.

&quot;John Adams&quot; was sent to Newport, Rhode Island, the wartime location of the Naval Academy, to act as training ship for midshipmen. In the summer of 1863 she joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and took station off Morris Island inside Charleston Bar. There she served as flagship of the inner blockade until she sailed into the harbor after the evacuation of Charleston in February 1865.

One of her crew, Coxswain Oliver O&#x27;Brien, received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the 1864 capture of a blockade runner. Another member of her crew, Acting Ensign Pierre d&#x27;Orléans, was a member of the Orleansist branch of the French royal family.

==Fate==
Late in the summer of 1865 she sailed to Boston where she was decommissioned in September. She was one of the oldest vessels in the US Navy at the time of her decommissioning.

&quot;John Adams&quot; was sold 5 October 1867 for $1500 to the British government to use as quarters for the Hong Kong police. She was taken to Hong Kong where her hulk was commissioned in 1868 for use as Water Police Headquarters. In February 1884 the hulk &quot;John Adams&quot; caught fire and was lost. later torpedoed and sank the burnt-out hulk.

<text>Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm (chữ Hán: ; 1491–1585) was a Vietnamese administrator, confucianist, poet, prophet and later a saint of the Cao Dai religion and of the new religious movement known as School of Teaching Goodness.

==Biography==
Born on the coast in Cổ Am village (which is now part of Hai Phong). As an adult, he studied knowledge from the second-rank doctor Lương Đắc Bằng and passed the official government examination at the fairly late age of 44 in the exams of 1535. However, he passed the exam, ranking number one in the country. This was a period of great instability in Vietnam which may explain why he took the exam at such a late age. He served in the Mạc dynasty court for just seven years until 1542 when he resigned after his official complaints of government corruptions were ignored. He then returned to his native village and opened a school. Among his students were Phùng Khắc Khoan (diplomat), Lương Hữu Khánh, Nguyễn Dữ (author of &quot;Truyền kỳ mạn lục&quot;).

Khiêm became a person much sought after by many leaders during that time of upheaval, civil war, the Mạc collapse, and the rise of the Trịnh lords and Nguyễn lords. Both Trịnh Kiểm and Nguyễn Hoàng purportedly sought his advice in their pursuit of power. To the former, he gave the advice of being the real power behind the (restored) Lê dynasty. To the latter, he advised building a base of power in the undeveloped south. Both men followed these suggestions, resulting in a political and military division of Vietnam that would last for 200 years. As a result of this sage advice, Khiêm gained a reputation as someone who could foretell the future. Some of his prophecies were of a Delphic nature as they were ambiguous and could be read in several ways.

Khiêm was also a poet, composing many poems in Chinese and Nôm that have survived to this day. There is a long poem attributed to him called &quot;Sấm Trạng Trình&quot; (讖狀程, The Prophecies of Trạng Trình). (Trạng Trình is one of Khiêm&#x27;s nicknames.)

This is the Vietnamese equivalent of the Nostradamus quatrains. It is suggestive, believed to predict future events, and very mysterious. This poem includes the line, &quot;Vietnam is being created&quot; (), an early use of the word Vietnam.

Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.

==Modern Cult in the School of Teaching Goodness==
The School of Teaching Goodness emerged in the 1990s in the Vĩnh Bảo District, a rural area of the city of Hải Phòng. A local carpenter known simply as &quot;Master Thu&quot; claimed to have been visited at night by the spirit of Khiêm, who ordered him to build a shrine in his honor. Thu owned some land, where he built and inaugurated in 1996 a shrine he called Minh Đường Trung Tân (The School of Teaching Goodness). By 2016, it had attracted more than 10,000 visitors, and Thu had organized around the channeled messages of Khiêm a new religious movement with thousands of followers.

In 2016, a woman credited with spiritual powers who lived near the shrine claimed to have found Khiêm&#x27;s coffin buried in her garden. State archeologists took the finding seriously and investigated it. The results were inconclusive, but the fame of the shrine grew as a result of the incident.

<text>Peanut oil, also known as groundnut oil or arachis oil, is a vegetable oil derived from peanuts. The oil usually has a mild or neutral flavor but, if made with roasted peanuts, has a stronger peanut flavor and aroma. It is often used in American, Chinese, Indian, African and Southeast Asian cuisine, both for general cooking and in the case of roasted oil, for added flavor. Peanut oil has a high smoke point relative to many other cooking oils, so it is commonly used for frying foods.

==History==
Due to war shortages of other oils, the use of readily available peanut oil increased in the United States during World War II.

== Production ==
In 2021, world production of peanut oil (reported as groundnut oil) was 4.75 million tonnes, led by China with 39% of the total (table). India was a major secondary producer.

==Uses==
Unrefined peanut oil is used as a flavorant for dishes akin to sesame oil. Refined peanut oil is commonly used for frying volume batches of foods like French fries and has a smoke point of 450 °F/232 °C.

Unrefined peanut oil is commonly used for cooking due to its natural flavor and nutritional benefits. It&#x27;s also used in skincare products for its moisturizing properties.

Unrefined peanut oil is often used in salad dressings and marinades for its rich, nutty taste.

===Biodiesel===
At the 1900 Paris Exhibition, the Otto Company, at the request of the French Government, demonstrated that peanut oil could be used as a source of fuel for the diesel engine; this was one of the earliest demonstrations of biodiesel technology.

Crude peanut oil can be filtered and placed in a reaction tank with methanol and sodium hydroxide to yield methyl ester - the Biodiesel fuel. 

===Other uses===
Peanut oil, as with other vegetable oils, can be used to make soap by the process of saponification. Peanut oil is safe for use as a massage oil.

==Composition==
The oil is 93% fat, composed of oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat (57% of total), linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fat (20%), and palmitic acid, a saturated fat (16%).

==Nutritional content==
In a reference amount of , peanut oil is a rich source of vitamin E, providing 101% of the Daily Value (table). There is no protein or carbohydrate content, and no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table). 

==Health issues==

===Toxins===
If quality control is neglected, peanuts that contain the mold that produces highly toxic aflatoxin can end up contaminating the oil derived from them.

===Allergens===
Those allergic to peanuts can consume highly refined peanut oil, but should avoid first-press, organic oil. Most highly refined peanut oils remove the peanut allergens and have been shown to be safe for &quot;the vast majority of peanut-allergic individuals&quot;. However, cold-pressed peanut oils may not remove the allergens and thus could be highly dangerous to people with peanut allergy.

Since the degree of processing for any particular product is often unclear, many believe that &quot;avoidance is prudent&quot;.

<text>Thomas Pride VC (29 March 1835 – 16 July 1893) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a serviceman in the British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Pride was 29 years old, and a captain of the after guard in the Royal Navy during the Shimonoseki Expedition, Japan when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 6 September 1864 at Shimonoseki, Japan, Captain of the After Guard Pride was one of the two colour sergeants who accompanied Midshipman Duncan Gordon Boyes from HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; when they carried the Queen&#x27;s Colour into action in the capture of the enemy&#x27;s stockade. They kept the flag flying in spite of the fierce fire which killed the other colour sergeant and severely wounded Pride. He and the midshipman, however, did not falter and were only finally prevented from going further forward by direct orders from their superior officer.

==Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, London.

<text>Mohammad Hashim Kamali (Pashto/Dari: ; born 7 February 1944) is an Afghan Islamic scholar and former professor of law at the International Islamic University of Malaysia. He taught Islamic law and jurisprudence between 1985 and 2004. One author has described him as &quot;the most widely read living author on Islamic law in the English language.&quot;

==Education==
Kamali studied his BA at University of Kabul and completed his LL.M.. in comparative law from The London School of Economics and Political Science, and a PhD in Islamic and Middle Eastern law at the University of London, 1969–1976.

==Academic career==
Kamali served as Professor of Islamic law and jurisprudence at the International Islamic University Malaysia, and also as Dean of the International Institute of Islamic Thought &amp; Civilisation (ISTAC) from 1985 to 2007. He currently is the chairman of the &quot;Institute for Law and Society&quot; (ILSAF).

In 2000 he published &quot;Islamic Commercial Law: An Analysis of Futures and Options&quot;, an analysis of options and futures contracts as trading tools from the point of view of shariah. The book is divided into three parts: the first describes derivatives trading in its nuts-and-bolts in secular terms. The second part looks at the issue of whether futures trading is permissible in Islamic law, and concludes that it is, due to the principle of maslaha, i.e. consideration of the public interest. The third part of the book draws the same conclusion with regard to options. Businessman Mohammed Amin recommended the book.

<text>Calshot is a coastal village in Hampshire, England, at the west corner of Southampton Water where it joins the Solent.

==History==
In 1539, Henry VIII ordered the construction of Calshot Castle, at the end of Calshot Spit, to defend the port of Southampton from attack. Its strategic importance continues to the present day, and there is still a military presence in Calshot, though the castle is no longer a manned fort.

Calshot is notable for its role in the development of aircraft and flying boats. In 1913 the Royal Flying Corps established Calshot Naval Air Station (later known as RNAS Calshot and RAF Calshot) at the end of Calshot Spit. It was also at one point home to Lawrence of Arabia.

Calshot Lifeboat Station was established in 1970 by the RNLI.

===Relationship with Tristan da Cunha===
Following a volcanic eruption in 1961, the population of the Tristan da Cunha islands was evacuated to Calshot. Many evacuees thrived, with the children attending local schools and adults employed in a variety of local businesses and on ships. However, problems occurred: one of the islanders&#x27; elders, a disabled gentleman called Ian Bootla, was mugged, the islanders lacked immunity from flu epidemics, and they also had to endure the harsh winter of 1962–63. Most of the islanders returned home, but some of the families decided to stay and remain a close-knit community centred on a complex of 50 houses called Tristan Close. Those that returned to Tristan da Cunha renamed the harbour there Calshot Harbour, after their temporary home.

==Today==

The original hangar from the World War II flying boats remains as an activity centre for watersports (including kite-surfing), climbing, snowboarding and track cycling. There is a small indoor velodrome, a dry ski slope, and facilities for climbing and bouldering. The climbing grades vary from about 3 to the occasional 8a. The centre offers residential and visitor courses.

Next to the hangar is a dinghy marina. The approach road passes on the landward side of the spit, and there are a large number of beach huts.
The spit comprises a flint pebble structure around one mile long. Between it and the main shore is a salt marshy area with a wealth of wildlife and birds. The nearby Fawley Power Station discharged cooling water into the shallow waters around Calshot beach, and this has led to some reports of warm water species being attracted into the Solent. The Habitats Directive Review of Consents for the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation (SAC) did indeed identify thermal pollution on the intertidal zone on the west shore of Southampton Water, but this is likely to be from more than this one source. Excavation for the nearby power station discovered buried land surfaces from the Neolithic period.

<text>Steven Neal Barton (June 26, 1954 – July 21, 2001) was an American actor, singer, dancer, teacher, choreographer, and stage director. He worked internationally in the United States, London, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. He is most well-known for originating the role of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny in the West End and Broadway productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and later taking over the title role of The Phantom of the Opera in the Broadway production. He also originated the starring role of Graf von Krolock in &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;.

== Early life ==
Barton was born on June 26, 1954, in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the youngest of three children of Tom and Mary Barton. He was raised in Nederland, Texas.

He won a scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin (UT), where he majored in theater, dance and voice, and appeared in over 30 productions with UT and the Ballet of Austin. A UT endowed Presidential Scholarship is now named for him. After graduation he went to Europe. 

== Career ==
He landed his first professional role in St. Gallen, Switzerland, then performed in several major Swiss, German and Austrian theater companies.

He played leading roles in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Godspell&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and &quot;Camelot&quot;, before playing the role of &quot;Munkustrap&quot; in the original Vienna cast of &quot;Cats&quot;, at the Theater an der Wien. At the Theater des Westens in Berlin he played roles in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (as Jesus), &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; (as both Jean Michel and Albin/Zaza) and Robert in &quot;Company&quot;. 

In 1986, Barton originated the role of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; in London. He also understudied the title role and notably played the role when Michael Crawford was sick in April 1987. In 1988, he reprised the role of Raoul in the original Broadway cast.
In 1989, Barton reprised his performance as Raoul opposite Crawford’s Phantom in the previews and opening night performance of the Ahmanson Theatre production of the show when principal Raoul actor Reece Holland was injured. Barton took over the role of The Phantom in 1990 from Cris Groenendaal in the Broadway production; he was the fourth principal actor to portray the role on Broadway.

In 1996, Barton returned to Vienna, where he took over the part of The Beast in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. He originated the role of Graf von Krolock, a vampire in Jim Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;, for which he won an IMAGE (International Music Award Germany) in 1998. Barton celebrated his 30-year onstage anniversary in 1997 during his run as von Krolock.

At the end of his life he was working on &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; in Bremen, Germany. He was taking over the title role from Ethan Freeman.

== Personal life ==

Barton was married to swing dancer and choreographer Denny Berry, who served as dance supervisor for the North American productions of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, whom he met at college. Their son, Edward, was born in Vienna in 1984; the couple separated at an unspecified later date. He was an honorary chairperson of the Steadman Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation and an honorary member of the UTA Board of Education.

==Death==
Barton was found dead at his apartment in Bremen, Germany, on July 21, 2001, aged 47. While his death was initially attributed to heart failure, according to obituary information released by the press office for the New York production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, it was later ruled a suicide by the Bremen district attorney.

<doc id="1195954" wikidata="Q5499662" url="?curid=1195954" title="FreePPP">
<text>FreePPP is a Point to Point Protocol (PPP) implementation for computers running the classic Mac OS. FreePPP was widely considered the first working and most stable version of PPP for Apple Macintosh and led many PPP internet service providers to support Macintosh users for the first time.

Besides the overall stability, usability was a large factor in the popularity of this implementation. A menu bar icon was introduced that gave users easy access to common tasks such as dialing and disconnecting. Modems were &quot;auto-detected&quot;, keeping users from having to find and configure an init string for their modem (a common stumbling block for users). FreePPP was installed by a &quot;lite&quot; version of the commercial Internet Setup Monkey product, whose producer Rockstar Studios was a primary contributor to FreePPP. The installer included cartoon images of a monkey installing software on the computer.

== Early history ==
FreePPP 1.0, the first version, was simply a repackaging of MacPPP from Merit Network; MacPPP developed for the most part by Larry Blunk. MacPPP was actually the first PPP for the Mac OS but was unstable and prone to error. The source code was made freely available and various users released fixes for common bugs. Steve Dagley aggregated most of those patches to MacPPP and added ISDN functionality. He re-released it as FreePPP in early 1994.

== Adoption by Apple ==
FreePPP 2.5, the most popular version, was the result of Apple Computer getting involved in the development of MacPPP. Steve Dagley contacted Apple about his work with FreePPP and convinced Apple to use it for its Internet software, Cyberdog. An Apple engineer, Richard Reynolds, rewrote most of FreePPP, greatly improving stability.

Richard left Apple to form Rockstar Studios along with Brian Chen, creator of the immensely popular screensaver from Berkeley Systems, &quot;After Dark&quot;. Apple allowed Richard to take his work with him to Rockstar and continue it. Consequently, Steve Dagley and Richard (along with Rockstar) created The FreePPP Group to manage the distribution and licensing of FreePPP. Steve Dagley developed an all-new control panel that included location management. Rockstar Studios contributed PPP Menu and The Internet Setup Monkey. The Internet Setup Monkey included a cartoon monkey, developed by Matt Small, that appears to tear apart a computer, install FreePPP then put it back together. Rockstar sold this installer to Internet Service providers. This was a time when most operating systems did not come with any form of TCP networking support, requiring separate installation before its users could connect to the Internet. Installation and configuration issues were a common problem for both users and ISPs.

Apple released a version of FreePPP under the old name MacPPP and included it in a few minor System 7.5.x releases. Open Transport eventually included a completely new PPP developed by Apple directly into Mac OS but many users choose FreePPP for its advanced and easy to use features. Eventually Rockstar Studios released a version of PPP Menu that supported Open Transport PPP (OT/PPP), consequently FreePPP users slowly migrated to Open Transport PPP. FreePPP is still widely available for users of older Macintosh hardware that cannot run Mac OS X. One of the most popular features of FreePPP is still included in macOS today. macOS includes a menu bar icon that allows users to open and close a PPP connection as well as configure PPP.

== Legacy ==
As of 2004, Steve Dagley works for Netscape on the Mac OS version of Netscape Communicator. Richard Reynolds still works at Rockstar Studios. Rockstar Studios released software centered on FreePPP and Open Transport PPP though the late ’90s then changed its name to Rockstar Software and it changed its focus to Microsoft Windows based Internet account setup software. The company once again changed its name to Aramova, Inc. and changed its focus to wireless software. Aramova does not seem to have any macOS products at this time.

== Contributors ==
Besides Steve Dagley and Richard Reynolds, other contributors in the FreePPP group are Mike Alexander, Yan Arrouye, Steve Brecher, Jim Browne, Alec Carlson, Tom Evans, Joe Husk, Cliff McCollum, Edward Moy, Tom Shaw and John Stephen. Most of the initial patches the Steve Dagley aggregated came from these contributors.

<text>Captain Hugh Talbot Burgoyne VC (17 July 1833 – 7 September 1870) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross. Born in Dublin, he was the son of John Fox Burgoyne and the grandson of John Burgoyne.

Burgoyne was a 21-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant, serving in the Crimean War when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the VC.

==Details==
On 29 May 1855, in the Sea of Azov, Crimea, Lieutenant Burgoyne of HMS &quot;Swallow&quot;, with Lieutenant Cecil William Buckley from HMS &quot;Miranda&quot; and Gunner John Robarts from HMS &quot;Ardent&quot;, volunteered to land at a beach where the Russian army were in strength. They were out of covering gunshot range of the ships offshore and met considerable enemy opposition, but managed to set fire to corn stores and ammunition dumps and destroy enemy equipment before embarking again.

Burgoyne was Commander on HMS &quot;Ganges&quot; under Captain John Fulford during that vessel&#x27;s service in the waters of the Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia during the fledgling years of the latter colony&#x27;s establishment. &quot;When the American merchant ship &quot;Northern Eagle&quot; was burned in Esquimalt Harbour, Captain Burgoyne was highly commended for his efforts to save everything possible from the burning ship. Seamen from the &quot;Ganges&quot;, &quot;Pylades&quot;, &quot;Tribune&quot;, and &quot;Plumper&quot; also assisted.&quot;

==Later career==
Burgoyne later achieved the rank of captain and was killed when in command of HMS &quot;Captain&quot;, which capsized off Cape Finisterre during a gale on 7 September 1870. This revolutionary masted turret ship had been the subject of considerable controversy during its design and construction and its loss was attributed to its poor stability.

Lost at sea, Burgoyne and his father [Field Marshall Sir John Fox Talbot buried at the Tower of London] are memorialised in Brompton Cemetery, London, at the Burgoyne family plot against the wall, towards the north-east corner of the cemetery.

==Legacy==
Burgoyne Bay in British Columbia was named after him in 1859.
St. Paul’s Cathedral, London houses a memorial to Burgoyne and the Officers, Marines, Men and Boys who perished off the South African Coast.

<doc id="1195973" wikidata="Q1394849" url="?curid=1195973" title="Downy mildew">
<text>Downy mildew refers to any of several types of oomycete microbes that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to the Peronosporaceae family. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vegetables that grow on vines. The prime example is &quot;Peronospora farinosa&quot; featured in NCBI-Taxonomy and HYP3. This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states. It progresses northward with cucurbit production each spring. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is most likely related to soft rots that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit. Cucurbit downy mildew only affects leaves of cucurbit plants.

== Symptoms ==

Initial symptoms include large, angular or blocky, yellow areas visible on the upper surface. They can also be distinguished by their sporadic yellow patch appearance. As lesions mature, they expand rapidly and turn brown. The under surface of infected leaves appears watersoaked. Upon closer inspection, a purple-brown mold (conidiophores) becomes apparent. Small spores shaped like footballs can be observed among the mold with a 10x hand lens. As a result of numerous infectious sites, leaves might show a blighted appearance if the disease continues to spread. In disease-favorable conditions (cool nights with long dew periods), downy mildew will spread rapidly, destroying leaf tissue without affecting stems or petioles.

=== Floricolous species ===
One monophyletic clade of &quot;Peronospora&quot;, known as the &quot;floricolous downy mildews&quot;, only cause symptoms in the flowers of their hosts. Infection is systemic, with hyphae produced at low densities in the host xylem. This clade is known from hostplants in the Asteraceae, Campanulaceae, Dipsacaceae, Lamiaceae, and Orobanchaceae.

One floricolous species, &quot;Peronospora violacea&quot;, causes its host &quot;Succisa pratensis&quot; to produce longer, pinker petals, and abort its anthers. Other authors report that on the same host it causes the host corollas to be brownish and dead-looking.

== Treatment and management ==

=== Cultural options ===
Because the downy mildew pathogen does not overwinter in midwestern fields, crop rotations and tillage practices do not affect disease development. The pathogen tends to become established in late summer. Therefore, planting early season varieties may further reduce the already minor threat posed by downy mildew. When downy mildew does pose a threat, the removal and destruction of plants displaying symptoms is good practice. 

=== Chemical control ===
Fungicides applied specifically for downy mildew control may be unnecessary. Broad spectrum protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and fixed copper are at least somewhat effective in protecting against downy mildew infection. Systemic fungicides are labeled for use against cucurbit downy mildew, but are recommended only after diagnosis of this disease has been confirmed. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved oxathiapiprolin for use against downy mildew. In Canada, a mixture of zoxamide and mancozeb was registered for control of the mildew under the trademark Gavel (fungicide) as early as 2008.

=== Organic control ===
One way to control downy mildew is to eliminate moisture and humidity around the impacted plants. Watering from below, such as with a drip system, and improve air circulation through selective pruning. In enclosed environments, like in the house or in a greenhouse, reducing the humidity will help as well.

=== Resistant cultivars ===
Recent breeding efforts have produced resistant basil cultivars. Choosing resistant cultivars, in combination with other prevention and control measures, can help growers with high downy mildew pressure still produce a viable crop.

== Plant-specific mildews ==

===Basil===
Downy mildew of basil caused by &quot;Peronospora belbahrii&quot; has been a huge problem for both commercial producers and home growers. The disease was first reported in Italy in 2004, was reported in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008 and has been steadily increasing in prevalence, distribution, and economic importance since then. The highest disease occurrence in basil leaves occurs at temperatures around 68°F.

===Cucurbitaceae===
Cucurbitaceae downy mildew (caused by &quot;Pseudoperonospora cubensis&quot;) is specific to cucurbits (e.g., cantaloupe (&quot;Cucumis melo&quot;), cucumber (&quot;Cucumis sativus&quot;), pumpkin, squash, watermelon (&quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot;) and other members of the gourd family). The disease is one of the most significant diseases of cucurbits worldwide.

===Grapes===
&quot;Plasmopara viticola&quot; is the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew.

===Hops===
Hop Downy Mildew (caused by &quot;Pseudoperonospora humuli&quot;) is specific to hops (&quot;Humulus lupulus&quot;). The disease is the single most devastating disease in Western United States hopyards, since the microbe thrives in moist climates. Infected young hop bines become stunted with thickened clusters of pale curled leaves. These spikes have a silvery upper surface, while the undersides of leaves become blackened with spores. These dwarfed spikes are called &quot;basal spikes&quot;. &#x27;Lateral&#x27; or &#x27;terminal&#x27; spikes occur further up the vine. An entire hop crop could be devastated in only a few days.

===Ornamentals===
A new and particularly aggressive form of impatiens downy mildew has recently emerged as a major threat to the cultivation of ornamental impatiens in the United States, where they are one of the most popular ornamental plants.

&quot;Peronospora sparsa&quot; attacks rose bushes (including &quot;Rosa canina&quot;) and Rubus species.

===Soybeans===
&quot;Peronospora manshurica&quot; infects soybeans, reducing photosynthetic activity, yield, and quality. The fungus spreads by oospores on diseased leaves and/or on infected seed. The disease spreads in environments with high humidity and favors temperatures between 20-22 °C. Tufts of grayish to pale-colored sporangiophores on the underside of leaves easily distinguish the infection from other foliar diseases. The disease is often controlled using the fungicides mancozeb, maneb, or zineb.

===Spinach===
Downy mildew on spinach is caused by &quot;Peronospora effusa,&quot; an oomycete pathogen that poses a challenge to spinach production worldwide, especially in organic production.

===Sunflowers===
&quot;Plasmopara halstedii&quot; infects sunflowers, producing oospores which can remain dormant in the soil for many years.

<doc id="1195987" wikidata="Q409587" url="?curid=1195987" title="Naltrexone">
<text>Naltrexone, sold under the brand name Revia among others, is a medication primarily used to manage alcohol use or opioid use disorder by reducing cravings and feelings of euphoria associated with substance use disorder. It has also been found effective in the treatment of other addictions and may be used for them off-label. An opioid-dependent person should not receive naltrexone before detoxification. It is taken orally or by injection into a muscle. Effects begin within 30 minutes, though a decreased desire for opioids may take a few weeks to occur.
Side effects may include trouble sleeping, anxiety, nausea, and headaches. In those still on opioids, opioid withdrawal may occur. Use is not recommended in people with liver failure. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and works by blocking the effects of opioids, including both opioid drugs as well as opioids naturally produced in the brain.
Naltrexone was first made in 1965 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. Naltrexone, as naltrexone/bupropion (brand name Contrave), is also used to treat obesity. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 254th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

===Alcohol use disorder===
Naltrexone has been best studied as a treatment for alcoholism. Naltrexone has been shown to decrease the quantity and frequency of ethanol consumption by reducing the dopamine release from the brain after consuming alcohol. It does not appear to change the percentage of people drinking. Its overall benefit has been described as &quot;modest&quot;.

Acamprosate may work better than naltrexone for eliminating alcohol abuse, while naltrexone may decrease the desire for alcohol to a greater extent.

A method pioneered by scientist John David Sinclair (dubbed commercially the “Sinclair Method”) advocates for “pharmacological extinction” of problem drinking behavior by administering naltrexone alongside controlled alcohol consumption. In effect, he argues that naltrexone-induced opioid antagonism sufficiently disrupts reflexive reward mechanisms inherent in the consumption of alcohol and, given enough repetition, will dissociate positive associations formerly made with the consumption of alcohol. The Sinclair Method has a clinically proven success rate of 78%.

===Opioid use disorder===
Long-acting injectable naltrexone (under the brand name Vivitrol) is an opioid antagonist, blocking the effects of heroin and other opioids, and decreases heroin use compared to a placebo. Unlike methadone and buprenorphine, it is not a controlled medication. It may decrease cravings for opioids after a number of weeks, and decreases the risk of overdose, at least during the time period that naltrexone is still active, though concern about risk of overdose for those stopping treatment remains. It is given once per month and has better compliance and effect for opioid use than the oral formulation.

A drawback of injectable naltrexone is that it requires patients with opioid use disorder and current physiological dependence to be fully withdrawn before it is initiated to avoid a precipitated opioid withdrawal that may be quite severe. In contrast, initiation of buprenorphine only requires delay of the first dose until the patient begins to manifest at least mild opioid withdrawal symptoms. Among patients able to successfully initiate injectable naltrexone, long-term remission rates were similar to those seen in clinical buprenorphine/naloxone administration. 

The consequence of relapse when weighing the best course of treatment for opiate use disorder remains a concern. Methadone and buprenorphine administration maintain greater drug tolerance while naltrexone allows tolerance to fade, leading to higher instances of an overdose in people who relapse and thus higher mortality. World Health Organization guidelines state that most patients should be advised to use opioid agonists (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) rather than opioid antagonists like naltrexone, citing evidence of superiority in reducing mortality and retaining patients in care.

A 2011 review found insufficient evidence to determine the effect of naltrexone taken orally on opioid dependence. While some do well with this formulation, it must be taken daily, and a person whose cravings become overwhelming can obtain opioid intoxication simply by skipping a dose. Due to this issue, the usefulness of oral naltrexone in opioid use disorder is limited by the low retention in treatment. Naltrexone taken orally remains an ideal treatment for a small number of people with opioid use, usually those with a stable social situation and motivation. With additional contingency management support, naltrexone may be effective in a broader population.

===Others===
Unlike varenicline (brand name Chantix), naltrexone is not useful for quitting smoking. Naltrexone has also been under investigation for reducing behavioral addictions such as gambling, NSSID (non-suicidal self-injury disorder), and kleptomania, as well as compulsive sexual behaviors in both offenders and non-offenders (e.g. compulsive porn viewing and masturbation). The results were promising. In one study, the majority of sexual offenders reported a strong reduction in sexual urges and fantasies which reverted to baseline once the medication was discontinued. Case reports have also shown cessation of gambling and other compulsive behaviors, for as long as the medication was taken.

When taken at much smaller doses, a regimen known as low-dose naltrexone (LDN), naltrexone may reduce pain and help to address neurological symptoms. Some patients report that LDN helps reduce their symptoms of ME/CFS, multiple sclerosis (MS), fibromyalgia, or autoimmune diseases. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, some have speculated that it may act as an anti-inflammatory. LDN is also being considered as a potential treatment for long COVID.

===Available forms===
Naltrexone is available and most commonly used in the form of an oral tablet (50 mg). Vivitrol, a naltrexone formulation for depot injection containing 380 mg of the medication per vial, is also available. Additionally, naltrexone subcutaneous implants that are surgically implanted are available. While these are manufactured in Australia, they are not authorized for use within Australia, but only for export. By 2009, naltrexone implants showed superior efficacy in the treatment of heroin dependence when compared to the oral form.

==Contraindications==
Naltrexone should not be used by persons with acute hepatitis or liver failure, or those with recent opioid use (typically 7–10 days).

==Side effects==
The most common side effects reported with naltrexone are gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are analogous to the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, as the μ-opioid receptor blockade will increase gastrointestinal motility.

The side effects of naltrexone by incidence are as follows:

* Greater than 10%: difficulty sleeping, anxiety, , abdominal pain/cramps, nausea and/or vomiting, low energy, joint/muscle pain, and headache.
* Less than 10%: loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, thirstiness, increased energy, feeling down, irritability, dizziness, skin rash, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and chills.
* A variety of other adverse events have also been reported with less than 1% incidence.

===Opioid withdrawal===
Naltrexone should not be started until several (typically 7–10) days of abstinence from opioids have been achieved. This is due to the risk of acute opioid withdrawal if naltrexone is taken, as naltrexone will displace most opioids from their receptors. The time of abstinence may be shorter than 7 days, depending on the half-life of the specific opioid taken. Some physicians use a naloxone challenge to determine whether an individual has any opioids remaining. The challenge involves giving a test dose of naloxone and monitoring for opioid withdrawal. If withdrawal occurs, naltrexone should not be started.

===Adverse effects===
Whether naltrexone causes dysphoria, depression, anhedonia, or other aversive effects has been studied and reviewed. In early studies of normal and opioid-abstinent individuals, acute and short-term administration of naltrexone was reported to produce a variety of aversive effects including fatigue, loss of energy, sleepiness, mild dysphoria, depression, lightheadedness, faintness, confusion, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweating, and occasional derealization. However, these studies were small, often uncontrolled, and used subjective means of assessing side effects. Most subsequent longer-term studies of naltrexone for indications like alcohol or opioid dependence have not reported dysphoria or depression with naltrexone in most individuals. According to one source:

: Naltrexone itself produces little or no psychoactive effect in normal research volunteers even at high doses, which is remarkable given that the endogenous opioid system is important in normal hedonic functioning. Because endogenous opioids are involved in the brain reward system, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that naltrexone might produce anhedonic or dysphoric effects. Although some evidence from small, early trials suggested that patients with a history of opiate dependence might be susceptible to dysphoric effects in response to naltrexone (Crowley et al. 1985; Hollister et al. 1981), reports of such effects have been inconsistent. Most large clinical studies of recovering opioid-dependent individuals have not found naltrexone to have an adverse effect on mood (Greenstein et al. 1984; Malcolm et al. 1987; Miotto et al. 2002; Shufman et al. 1994). Some studies have actually found improvements in mood during the course of treatment with naltrexone (Miotto et al. 1997; Rawlins and Randall 1976).

Based on available evidence, naltrexone seems to have minimal untoward effects in the aforementioned areas, at least with long-term therapy. It has been suggested that differences in findings between acute and longer-term studies of naltrexone treatment might be related to altered function in the opioid system with chronic administration of naltrexone. For example, marked upregulation of opioid receptors and hyper-sensitivity to opioids have been observed with naltrexone in preclinical studies. Another possibility is that the central opioid system may have low endogenous functionality in most individuals, becoming active only in the presence of exogenously administered opioid receptor agonists or with stimulation by endogenous opioids induced by pain or stress. A third possibility is that normal individuals may experience different side effects with naltrexone than people with addictive disease such as alcohol or opioid dependence, who may have altered opioid tone or responsiveness. It is notable in this regard that most studies of naltrexone have been in people with substance dependence.

Naltrexone may also initially produce opioid withdrawal-like symptoms in a small subset of people not dependent on opioids:

: The side-effect profile [of naltrexone], at least on the recommended dose of 50 mg per day, is generally benign, although 5 to 10 percent of detoxified opioid addicts experience immediate, intolerable levels of withdrawal-like effects including agitation, anxiety, insomnia, light-headedness, sweating, dysphoria, and nausea. Most patients on naltrexone experience few or no symptoms after the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment; for a substantial minority (20 to 30 percent) protracted discomfort is experienced.

Persisting affective distress related to naltrexone may account for individuals taking the drug who drop out of treatment.

Naltrexone has been reported to reduce feelings of social connection. The μ-opioid receptor has been found to play a major role in social reward in animals and the μ-opioid receptor knockout mouse is an animal model of autism. Studies on whether naltrexone can decrease the pleasurable effects of listening to music are conflicting. Besides humans, naltrexone has been found to produce aversive effects in rodents as assessed by conditioned place aversion.

===Liver damage===
Naltrexone has been reported to cause liver damage when given at doses higher than recommended. It carries an FDA boxed warning for this rare side effect. Due to these reports, some physicians may check liver function tests before starting naltrexone, and periodically thereafter. Concerns for liver toxicity initially arose from a study of nonaddicted obese patients receiving 300 mg of naltrexone. Subsequent studies have suggested limited or no toxicity in other patient populations and at typical recommended doses such as 50 to 100 mg/day.

==Overdose==
No toxic effects have been observed with naltrexone in doses of up to 800 mg/day in clinical studies. The largest reported overdose of naltrexone, which was 1,500 mg in a female patient and was equivalent to an entire bottle of medication (30 × 50 mg tablets), was uneventful. No deaths are known to have occurred with naltrexone overdose.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Opioid receptor blockade====
Naltrexone and its active metabolite 6β-naltrexol are competitive antagonists of the opioid receptors. Naltrexone is specifically an antagonist preferentially of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), to a lesser extent of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and to a much lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). However, naltrexone is not actually a silent antagonist of these receptors but instead acts as a weak partial agonist, with Emax values of 14 to 29% at the MOR, 16 to 39% at the KOR, and 14 to 25% at the DOR in different studies. In accordance with its partial agonism, although naltrexone is described as a pure opioid receptor antagonist, it has shown some evidence of weak opioid effects in clinical and preclinical studies.

By itself, naltrexone acts as an antagonist or weak partial agonist of the opioid receptors. In combination with agonists of the MOR such as morphine however, naltrexone appears to become an inverse agonist of the MOR. Conversely, the naltrexone remains a neutral antagonist (or weak partial agonist) of the KOR and DOR. In contrast to naltrexone, 6β-naltrexol is purely a neutral antagonist of the opioid receptors. The MOR inverse agonism of naltrexone, when it is co-present with MOR agonists, may in part underlie its ability to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. This may be due to suppression of basal MOR signaling via inverse agonism.

Occupancy of the opioid receptors in the brain by naltrexone has been studied using positron emission tomography (PET). Naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/day has been found to occupy approximately 90 to 95% of brain MORs and 20 to 35% of brain DORs. Naltrexone at a dose of 100 mg/day has been found to achieve 87% and 92% brain occupancy of the KOR in different studies. Per simulation, a lower dose of naltrexone of 25 mg/day might be expected to achieve around 60% brain occupancy of the KOR but still close to 90% occupancy of the MOR. In a study of the duration of MOR blockade with naltrexone, the drug with a single 50 mg dose showed 91% blockade of brain [11C]carfentanil (a selective MOR ligand) binding at 48 hours (2 days), 80% blockade at 72 hours (3 days), 46% blockade at 120 hours (5 days), and 30% blockade at 168 hours (7 days). The half-time of brain MOR blockade by naltrexone in this study was 72 to 108 hours (3.0 to 4.5 days). Based on these findings, doses of naltrexone of even less than 50 mg/day would be expected to achieve virtually complete brain MOR occupancy. Blockade of brain MORs with naltrexone is much longer-lasting than with other opioid antagonists like naloxone (half-time of ~1.7 hours intranasally) or nalmefene (half-time of ~29 hours).

The half-life of occupancy of the brain MOR and duration of clinical effect of naltrexone are much longer than suggested by its plasma elimination half-life. A single 50 mg oral dose of naltrexone has been found to block brain MORs and opioid effects for at least 48 to 72 hours. The half-time of brain MOR blockade by naltrexone (72–108 hours) is much longer than the fast plasma clearance component of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol (~4–12 hours) but was reported to correspond well to the longer terminal phase of plasma naltrexone clearance (96 hours). As an alternative possibility, the prolonged brain MOR occupancy by opioid antagonists like naltrexone and nalmefene may be due to slow dissociation from MORs consequent to their very high MOR affinity (&lt;1.0 nM).

Naltrexone blocks the effects of MOR agonists like morphine, heroin, and hydromorphone in humans via its MOR antagonism. Following a single 100 mg dose of naltrexone, the subjective and objective effects of heroin were blocked by 90% at 24 hours, with blockade then decreasing up to 72 hours. Similarly, 20 to 200 mg naltrexone dose-dependently antagonized the effects of heroin for up to 72 hours. Naltrexone also blocks the effects of KOR agonists like salvinorin A, pentazocine, and butorphanol in humans via its KOR antagonism. In addition to opioids, naltrexone has been found to block or reduce the rewarding and other effects of other euphoriant drugs including alcohol, nicotine, and amphetamines.

The opioid receptors are involved in neuroendocrine regulation. MOR agonists produce increases in levels of prolactin and decreases in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone. Doses of naltrexone of 25 to 150 mg/day have been found to produce significant increases in levels of β-endorphin, cortisol, and LH, equivocal changes in levels of prolactin and testosterone, and no significant changes in levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Naltrexone influences the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) probably through interference with opioid receptor signaling by endorphins.

Blockade of MORs is thought to be the mechanism of action of naltrexone in the management of opioid dependence—it reversibly blocks or attenuates the effects of opioids. It is also thought to be involved in the effectiveness of naltrexone in alcohol dependence by reducing the euphoric effects of alcohol. The role of KOR modulation by naltrexone in its effectiveness for alcohol dependence is unclear but this action may also be involved based on theory and animal studies.

====Other activities====
In addition to the opioid receptors, naltrexone binds to and acts as an antagonist of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interacts with high- and low-affinity binding sites in filamin A (FLNA). It is said that very low doses of naltrexone (&lt;0.001–1 mg/day) interact with FLNA, low doses (1 to 5 mg/day) produce TLR4 antagonism, and standard clinical doses (50 to 100 mg/day) exert opioid receptor and OGFR antagonism. The interactions of naltrexone with FLNA and TLR4 are claimed to be involved in the therapeutic effects of low-dose naltrexone.

===Pharmacokinetics===


====Absorption====
The absorption of naltrexone with oral administration is rapid and nearly complete (96%). The bioavailability of naltrexone with oral administration is 5 to 60% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Peak concentrations of naltrexone are 19 to 44 μg/L after a single 100 mg oral dose and time to peak concentrations of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol (metabolite) is within 1 hour. Linear increases in circulating naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol concentrations occur over an oral dose range of 50 to 200 mg. Naltrexone does not appear to be accumulated with repeated once-daily oral administration and there is no change in time to peak concentrations with repeated administration.

====Distribution====
The plasma protein binding of naltrexone is about 20% over a naltrexone concentration range of 0.1 to 500 μg/L. Its apparent volume of distribution at 100 mg orally is 16.1 L/kg after a single dose and 14.2 L/kg with repeated doses.

====Metabolism====
Naltrexone is metabolized in the liver mainly by dihydrodiol dehydrogenases into 6β-naltrexol (6β-hydroxynaltrexone). Levels of 6β-naltrexol are 10- to 30-fold higher than those of naltrexone with oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Conversely, 6β-naltrexol exposure is only about 2-fold higher than that of naltrexone with intramuscular injection of naltrexone in microspheres (brand name Vivitrol). 6β-Naltrexol is an opioid receptor antagonist similarly to naltrexone and shows a comparable binding profile to the opioid receptors. However, 6β-naltrexol is peripherally selective and crosses into the brain much less readily than does naltrexone. In any case, 6β-naltrexol does still show some central activity and may contribute significantly to the central actions of oral naltrexone. Other metabolites of naltrexone include 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6β-naltrexol and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxynaltrexone. Following their formation, the metabolites of naltrexone are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to form glucuronides. Naltrexone is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has low potential for drug interactions.

====Elimination====
The elimination of naltrexone is biexponential and rapid over the first 24 hours followed by a third extremely slow decline after 24 hours. The fast elimination half-lives of naltrexone and its metabolite 6β-naltrexol are about 4 hours and 13 hours, respectively. In Contrave oral tablets, which also contain bupropion and are described as extended-release, the half-life of naltrexone is 5 hours. The slow terminal-phase elimination half-life of naltrexone is approximately 96 hours. As microspheres of naltrexone by intramuscular injection (Vivitrol), the elimination half-lives of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol are both 5 to 10 days. Whereas oral naltrexone is administered daily, naltrexone in microspheres by intramuscular injection is suitable for administration once every 4 weeks or once per month.

Naltrexone and its metabolites are excreted in urine.

===Pharmacogenetics===
Tentative evidence suggests that family history and presence of the Asn40Asp polymorphism predict naltrexone being effective.

==Chemistry==
Naltrexone, also known as &quot;N&quot;-cyclopropylmethylnoroxymorphone, is a derivative of oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone). It is specifically the derivative of oxymorphone in which the tertiary amine methyl substituent is replaced with methylcyclopropane.

===Analogues===
The closely related medication, methylnaltrexone (&quot;N&quot;-methylnaltrexone), is used to treat opioid-induced constipation but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Nalmefene (6-desoxy-6-methylenenaltrexone) is similar to naltrexone and is used for the same purposes as naltrexone. Naltrexone should not be confused with naloxone (&quot;N&quot;-allylnoroxymorphone), which is used in emergency cases of opioid overdose. Other opioid antagonists related to naltrexone include 6β-naltrexol (6β-hydroxynaltrexone), samidorphan (3-carboxamido-4-hydroxynaltrexone), β-funaltrexamine (naltrexone fumarate methyl ester), nalodeine (&quot;N&quot;-allylnorcodeine), nalorphine (&quot;N&quot;-allylnormorphine), and nalbuphine (&quot;N&quot;-cyclobutylmethyl-14-hydroxydihydronormorphine).

==History==
Naltrexone was first synthesized in 1963 by Metossian at Endo Laboratories, a small pharmaceutical company in New York City. It was characterized by Blumberg, Dayton, and Wolf in 1965 and was found to be an orally active, long-acting, and very potent opioid antagonist. The drug showed advantages over earlier opioid antagonists such as cyclazocine, nalorphine, and naloxone, including its oral activity, a long duration of action allowing for once-daily administration, and a lack of dysphoria, and was selected for further development. It was patented by Endo Laboratories in 1967 under the developmental code name EN-1639A and Endo Laboratories was acquired by DuPont in 1969. Clinical trials for opioid dependence began in 1973, and a developmental collaboration of DuPont with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for this indication started the next year in 1974. The drug was approved by the FDA for the oral treatment of opioid dependence in 1984, with the brand name Trexan, and for the oral treatment of alcohol dependence in 1995, when the brand name was changed by DuPont to Revia. A depot formulation for intramuscular injection was approved by the FDA under the brand name Vivitrol for alcohol dependence in 2006 and opioid dependence in 2010.

===Brand names===
Naltrexone is or has been sold under a variety of brand names, including Adepend, Antaxone, Celupan, Depade, Destoxican, Nalorex, Narcoral, Nemexin, Nodict, Revia, Trexan, Vivitrex, and Vivitrol. It is also marketed in combination with bupropion (naltrexone/bupropion) as Contrave, and was marketed with morphine (morphine/naltrexone) as Embeda. A combination of naltrexone with buprenorphine (buprenorphine/naltrexone) has been developed, but has not been marketed.

===Controversies===
The FDA authorized use of injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid addiction using a single study that was led by Evgeny Krupitsky at Bekhterev Research Psychoneurological Institute, St Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University, St Petersburg, Russia, a country where opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine are not available. The study was a &quot;double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized&quot;, 24-week trial running &quot;from July 3, 2008, through October 5, 2009&quot; with &quot;250 patients with opioid dependence disorder&quot; at &quot;13 clinical sites in Russia&quot; on the use of injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence. The study was funded by the Boston-based biotech Alkermes firm which produces and markets naltrexone in the United States. Critics charged that the study violated ethical guidelines since it compared the formulation of naltrexone not to the best available, evidence-based treatment (methadone or buprenorphine), but to a placebo. Further, the trial did not follow patients who dropped out of the trial to evaluate subsequent risk of fatal overdose, a major health concern . Subsequent trials in Norway and the US did compare injectable naltrexone to buprenorphine and found them to be similar in outcomes for patients willing to undergo the withdrawal symptoms required before naltrexone administration. Nearly 30% of patients in the US trial did not complete induction. In real-world settings, a review of more than 40,000 patient records found that while methadone and buprenorphine reduced risk of fatal overdose, naltrexone administration showed no greater effect on overdose or subsequent emergency care than counseling alone.

Despite these findings, naltrexone&#x27;s manufacturer and some health authorities have promoted the medicine as superior to methadone and buprenorphine since it is not an opioid and does not induce dependence. The manufacturer has also marketed directly to law enforcement and criminal justice officials, spending millions of dollars on lobbying and providing thousands of free doses to jails and prisons. The technique has been successful, with the criminal justice system in 43 states now incorporating long-acting naltrexone. Many do this through Vivitrol courts that offer only this option, leading some to characterize this as &quot;an offer that cannot be refused.&quot; The company&#x27;s marketing techniques have led to a Congressional investigation, and warning from the FDA about failure to adequately state risks of fatal overdose to patients receiving the medicine.

In May 2017, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price praised [Vivitrol] as the future of opioid addiction treatment after visiting the company&#x27;s plant in Ohio. His remarks set off sharp criticism with almost 700 experts in the field of substance use submitting a letter to Price cautioning him about Vivitrol&#x27;s &quot;marketing tactics&quot; and warning him that his comments &quot;ignore widely accepted science&quot;. The experts pointed out that Vivitrol&#x27;s competitors, buprenorphine and methadone, are &quot;less expensive&quot;, &quot;more widely used&quot;, and have been &quot;rigorously studied&quot;. Price had claimed that buprenorphine and methadone were &quot;simply substitute[s]&quot; for &quot;illicit drugs&quot; whereas according to the letter, &quot;the substantial body of research evidence supporting these treatments is summarized in guidance from within your own agency, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Buprenorphine and methadone have been demonstrated to be highly effective in managing the core symptoms of opioid use disorder, reducing the risk of relapse and fatal overdose, and encouraging long-term recovery.&quot;

===Film===
&quot;One Little Pill&quot; was a 2014 documentary film about the use of naltrexone to treat alcohol use disorder.

&quot;Four Good Days&quot; is a 2020 film about the four days a drug addict woman has to stay sober to get a shot of naltrexone in a detox facility.

==Research==

===Depersonalization===
Naltrexone is sometimes used in the treatment of dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization and derealization. Some studies suggest it might help. Other small, preliminary studies have also shown benefit. Blockade of the KOR by naltrexone and naloxone is thought to be responsible for their effectiveness in ameliorating depersonalization and derealization. Since these drugs are less efficacious in blocking the KOR relative to the MOR, higher doses than typically used seem to be necessary.

===Low-dose naltrexone===
Naltrexone has been used off-label at low doses for diseases not related to chemical dependency or intoxication, such as multiple sclerosis. Evidence for recommending low-dose naltrexone is lacking. This treatment has received attention on the Internet. In 2022, four studies (in a few hundred patients) were conducted on naltrexone for long COVID.

===Self-injury===
One study suggests that self-injurious behaviors present in persons with developmental disabilities (including autism) can sometimes be remedied with naltrexone.
In these cases, the self-injury is believed to be done to release beta-endorphin, which binds to the same receptors as heroin and morphine. If the &quot;rush&quot; generated by self-injury is removed, the behavior may stop.

===Behavioral disorders===
Some indications exist that naltrexone might be beneficial in the treatment of impulse-control disorders such as kleptomania, compulsive gambling, or trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling), but evidence of its effectiveness for gambling is conflicting. A 2008 case study reported successful use of naltrexone in suppressing and treating an internet pornography addiction.

===Interferon alpha===
Naltrexone is effective in suppressing the cytokine-mediated adverse neuropsychiatric effects of interferon alpha therapy.

===Critical addiction studies===
Some historians and sociologists have suggested that the meanings and uses attributed to anti-craving medicine, such as naltrexone, are context-dependent. Studies have suggested the use of naltrexone in drug courts or healthcare rehabs is a form of &quot;post-social control,&quot; or &quot;post-disciplinary control,&quot; whereby control strategies for managing offenders and addicts shift from imprisonment and supervision toward more direct control over biological processes.

===Sexual addiction===
Small studies have shown a reduction of sexual addiction and problematic sexual behaviours from naltrexone.

<doc id="1195989" wikidata="Q639358" url="?curid=1195989" title="Military Order of Aviz">
<text>The Military Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz (, ), previously to 1910 Royal Military Order of Saint Benedict of Aviz (), previously to 1789 Knights (of the Order) of Saint Benedict of Aviz () or &quot;Friars of Santa Maria of Évora&quot;, is a Portuguese order of chivalry, founded in Portugal in 1146. It gave its name and coat of arms to the Aviz Dynasty that ruled Portugal between 1385 and 1580.

==Early history==
The order, as a monastic military order, was founded in emulation of such military orders as the Knights Templar, which existed in Portugal as early as 1128, and received a grant from Theresa, Countess of Portugal in the year of the Council of Troyes, which confirmed their early statutes. A native order of this kind sprang up in Portugal about 1146. Afonso, the first king, gave to it the town of Évora, captured from the Moors in 1166, and the Knights were first called &quot;Friars of Santa Maria of Évora&quot;. Gonçalo Viegas, was the first grand master.

After the conquest of Aviz a castle erected there became the motherhouse of the order, and they were then called &quot;Knights of St. Benedict of Aviz&quot;, since they adopted the Benedictine rule in 1162, as modified by John Ziritu, one of the earliest Cistercian abbots of Portugal. Like the Knights of Calatrava in Castile, the Knights of Portugal were indebted to the Cistercians for their rule and their habit—a white mantle with a green fleur-de-lysed cross. The Knights of Calatrava also surrendered some of their places in Portugal to them on condition that the Knights of Aviz should be subject to the visitation of their grand master. Hence the Knights of Aviz were sometimes regarded as a branch of the Calatravan Order, although they never ceased to have a Portuguese grand master, dependent for temporalities on the Portuguese King.

At the death of King Ferdinand (1383) war broke out between Castile and Portugal. When João I, who had been grand master of the Knights of Aviz, ascended the throne of Portugal, he forbade the knights to submit to Castilian authority, and consequently, when Gonsalvo de Guzman came to Aviz as Visitor, the knights, while according him hospitality, refused to recognise him as a superior. Guzman protested, and the point remained a subject of contention until the Council of Basle (1431), when Portugal was declared to be in the wrong. But the right of the Calatravans was never exercised, and the next grand master of the Knights of Aviz, Fernando Rodrigues de Sequeira, continued to assert supreme authority over them.

The mission of the military orders in Portugal seemed to end after the overthrow of Muslim domination, but the Portuguese expeditions across the sea opened up a new field for them. The conquest of Ceuta by King João I (1415), the attacks upon Tangier under João&#x27;s son Duarte (1437) were also crusades, inspired by a religious spirit and sanctioned by similar Papal Bulls. The Knights of Aviz and the Knights of Christ from Order of Christ, scions of the Knights Templars, achieved deeds of valour, the former under the Prince Fernando, the latter under Henrique, brother of King Duarte. Fernando displayed a no less heroic forbearance during his six years of captivity among the Muslims, a long martyrdom which after his death placed him among the Blessed (Acta SS.,5 June).

This enthusiasm did not last, and the Crusade in Africa continued as a mercantile enterprise. After the grand mastership of the order had been vested in the King in perpetuity (1551), he availed himself of its income to reward any kind of service in the army or the fleet. If the wealth of the Knights of Aviz was not as great as that of the Knights of Christ, it was still quite large, drawn as it was from some forty-three commanderies. The religious spirit of the knights vanished, and they withdrew from their clerical brothers who continued alone the conventual life. They were dispensed from their vow of celibacy by Alexander VI (1502), who tolerated their marriage to prevent scandalous concubinage; Julius III (1551) allowed them to dispose freely of their personal properties. Nobility of birth remained the chief requirement of aspirants to the mantle, a requirement confirmed by a decree of 1604.

==Secularization of the order==

Pope Pius VI (1789) and Queen Mary I reformed the order into a secular institution. In 1834, when the civil government of Portugal abolished religious orders and monasteries, after the defeat of King Miguel in the Civil War, under the constitutional monarchy the order lost its properties. The ancient military orders were transformed by the liberal constitution and subsequent legislation into mere orders of merit. The privileges which once had been an essential part of the membership of the old military orders also ceased.

In 1910, when the Portuguese monarchy ended, the Republic of Portugal abolished all the orders except the Order of the Tower and Sword. However, in 1917, at the end of the Great War, some of these orders were re-established as mere orders of merit to reward outstanding services to the state, the office of grand master belonging to the head of state, the President of the Republic. The Military Order of Aviz, together with the other Portuguese Orders of Merit, had its statutes revised on several occasions, during the First Republic (1910–1926), then in 1962, and again in 1986.

The Military Order of Aviz, together with the Military Orders of Christ and of St. James of the Sword form the group of the &quot;Ancient Military Orders&quot;, governed by a chancellor and a council of eight members, appointed by the President of the Republic, to assist him as grand master in all matters concerning the administration of the order. The order can only be conferred on military personnel, both Portuguese and foreign, for outstanding service. For Portuguese nationals, a minimum of seven years of service in the armed forces is required as well as an outstanding and exemplary service record. The regulations of the order suggest classes to be conferred according to military rank thus: 
*Army Captains and Navy Lieutenants: Knight
*Majors and Lieutenant-Commanders: Officer
*Lieutenant Colonels and Commanders: Commander
*Colonels, Brigadiers, Navy Captains and Rear Admirals (US RADM, Commodore/US RDML being a virtually non-existing rank in the Portuguese Navy): Grand Officer
*Major Generals, Lieutenant Generals, Generals, Vice-Admirals and Admirals: Grand Cross.

However, a number of further provisions in the regulations of the order allow for exceptions to this general rule.

==Grades==
The Order of Aviz, as awarded by the Portuguese government today, comes in five classes:

*&quot;Grand Cross&quot; (GCA), which wears the badge of the Order on a sash on the right shoulder, and the star of the Order in gold on the left chest; 
*&quot;Grand Officer&quot; (GOA), which wears the badge of the Order on a necklet, and the star of the Order in gold on the left chest; 
*&quot;Commander&quot; (ComA), which wears the badge of the Order on a necklet, and the star of the Order in silver on the left chest; 
*&quot;Officer&quot; (OA), which wears the badge of the Order on a ribbon with rosette on the left chest; 
*&quot;Knight&quot; (CvA) or &quot;Dame&quot; (DmA), which wears the badge of the Order on a plain ribbon on the left chest.

A sixth class, Grand Collar (GColA), outranking all previous, was introduced in 2021.&lt;ref name=&quot;DL55/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insignia==

*The &quot;badge&quot; of the Order is a gilt cross with green enamel, similar to the Order&#x27;s emblem illustrated here, but with a longer lower arm. During the monarchy the badge was topped by the Sacred Heart of Christ.
*The &quot;star&quot; of the Order is an eight-pointed, faceted star, in gilt for Grand Cross and Grand Officer, and in silver for Commander. The central disc is in white enamel, with a miniature of the modern badge in it. During the monarchy the Sacred Heart of Christ was placed at the top of the star.
*The &quot;ribbon&quot; of the Order is plain green.

<text>The Hotel Canberra, also known as Hyatt Hotel Canberra, is a historic hotel in the Australian national capital, Canberra. It is located in the suburb of Yarralumla, near Lake Burley Griffin and Parliament House. It was built to house politicians when the Federal Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1927. It was constructed by the contractor John Howie between 1922-1925. Originally opened in 1924 as &quot;Hostel No. 1&quot;, in 1927 it became known as the &quot;Hotel Canberra&quot;.

==History==

The federal government decided in January 1921 to build a hostel in Canberra, to accommodate politicians and visitors, in anticipation of the relocation of federal government functions from Melbourne. The hotel was designed by federal architect John Smith Murdoch, and used an unusual (for a hotel) scheme of pavilions arranged around garden courts. The design gave each pavilion better outlook, and could be segregated from other pavilions (while still accessible to hotel services). The building opened on 10 December 1924.

The Hotel Canberra was the first hotel to open in Canberra. It was followed shortly after (in 1926) by the Hotel Kurrajong, located on the other side of the central axis of the Parliamentary Triangle. Once the national capital moved to Canberra, a number of other hotels opened in 1927. The Hotel Canberra was not licensed to serve alcohol until 1928 (which is why it was initially called a &quot;hostel&quot;), owing to Minister for Home Affairs King O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s decision to keep Canberra free of alcohol as it was being constructed.

The Canberra was frequently used as sitting-time accommodation by politicians and, in the early years, as long term accommodation for officials while homes were still being constructed for them. The same was true at the Hotel Kurrajong, with the Kurrajong reputedly favoured by politicians from the Australian Labor Party and the Canberra by politicians from the conservative parties.

When James Scullin became Prime Minister in 1929, he refused to live in The Lodge, the official residence of the Prime Minister, and he and his wife lived at the Hotel Canberra during parliamentary sessions, and at their home in Melbourne at other times. 

During the Great Depression, economic conditions and the reduction in the number of government employees reduced demand for accommodation in Canberra, and the Canberra and the Kurrajong were the only hotels left open for a time. 

In 1950, the government gave up the management of the hotel and the lease was taken over by Tooheys. In 1974 the lease was not renewed and the hotel was shut down. Between 1976 and 1984 it was used as an annexe for Parliament House, providing office space for parliamentary staff.

The hotel was designated as part of the National Estate by the federal government in 1980, shortly before a project began in 1982 to restore the hotel to its former glory and extend it in sympathetic style. After several years of troubles with the backers, Hyatt re-opened Hotel Canberra on 23 July 1988 as the new Hyatt Hotel Canberra, at the time the only international five-star hotel in Canberra.

On 30 September 1998, the building was added to the Interim Heritage Places Register of the Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register.

The Hyatt Hotel Canberra has been owned by Thailand-based conglomerate TCC Group, which purchased the building for AU $80 million in 2008.

<text>The Inner North Coast Ranges occur along the east slope of the outer Northern California Coast Ranges. The term &quot;inner&quot; is a reference to the greater distances of the mountain ranges from the Pacific Ocean, compared to the &quot;outer&quot; ranges that are nearer to that ocean, and often larger.

==Geography==
The inner ranges of mountains and hills run from near Anderson, California at the south end of the High North Coast Ranges, southwards to west of the Russian River.

==Ecology==
Willis Linn Jepson was one of the first to describe the flora of the Inner North Coast Ranges. Jepson noted the presence of Yellow Pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;) and Sugar Pine (&quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot;) species.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Edmund Commerell, (13 January 1829 – 21 May 1901) was a Royal Navy officer. As a junior officer, he was present at the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado in November 1845 during the Uruguayan Civil War. He also took part in operations in Sea of Azov during the Crimean War and went ashore with the quartermaster and a seaman, to destroy large quantities of enemy forage on the shore. After a difficult and dangerous journey they reached their objective – a magazine of corn – and managed to ignite the stacks, but the guards were alerted and immediately opened fire and gave chase. The men had difficulty in escaping, but they finally reached their ship and the lookouts later reported that the forage store had burned to the ground. He and his colleague, Quartermaster William Thomas Rickard, were awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Commerell went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope Station, Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station and then Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. He was also a Conservative politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1888.

==Early career==

Born the son of John Williams Commerell and Sophia Commerell (née Bosanquet), Commerell was educated at Clifton College and joined the Royal Navy in March 1842. He was appointed to the third-rate HMS &quot;Cornwallis&quot; and saw action in China in August 1842 during the First Opium War. He then transferred to the paddle frigate HMS &quot;Firebrand&quot; on the South America Station and was present at the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado in November 1845 during the Uruguayan Civil War. At Punta Obligado he helped cut the chain that defended the Paraná River. He transferred to the sloop HMS &quot;Comus&quot; at Woolwich in May 1848 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 13 December 1848, transferred to the paddle frigate HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1849 and to the screw frigate HMS &quot;Dauntless&quot; at Devonport in August 1850.

Commerell joined the frigate HMS &quot;Vulture&quot; in February 1854 and saw action in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean War. He became commanding officer of the gun vessel HMS &quot;Weser&quot; in February 1855; however the ship caught fire near Constantinople and was beached before being towed off and joining the bombardment of Sevastopol in June 1855. He then took part in operations in Sea of Azov and, having been promoted to commander on 29 September 1855, went ashore with the quartermaster and a seaman, to destroy large quantities of enemy forage on the shore. After a difficult and dangerous journey they reached their objective – a magazine of corn – and managed to ignite the stacks, but the guards were alerted and immediately opened fire and gave chase. The men had difficulty in escaping, but they finally reached their ship and the lookouts later reported that the forage store had burned to the ground. He and his colleague, Quartermaster William Thomas Rickard, were awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation reads:
Commerell became commanding officer of the steam vessel HMS &quot;Snake&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in February 1856 and, having been awarded French Legion of Honour, 5th class on 2 August 1856 and the Turkish Order of the Medjidie, fifth class on 3 April 1858, he became commanding officer of the paddle sloop HMS &quot;Fury&quot; on the East Indies and China Station in October 1858. He was second-in-command of a naval brigade which landed in China, but then had to retreat to their boats after facing firm resistance, at Battle of Taku Forts in June 1859 during the Second Opium War.

Promoted to captain on 18 July 1859, Commerell went on to be commanding officer of the paddle frigate HMS &quot;Magicienne&quot; on the East Indies and China Station in September 1859 and commanding officer of the turret ship HMS &quot;Scorpion&quot; at Portsmouth in May 1865. After that he became commanding officer of the frigate HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; in May 1866 and assisted the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot; to lay the fifth (and first successful) Atlantic cable. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (civil division) on 2 November 1866 and became commanding officer of the turret ship HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; in the Channel Squadron in May 1869. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (military division) on 2 June 1869.

==Senior command==
Promoted to commodore, second class in February 1871, Commerell became Commander-in-Chief Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, with his broad pennant in the corvette HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. However, in August 1873, when he was undertaking a reconnaissance up the Pra River at the start of the Third Anglo-Ashanti War, he was wounded in the lung, and had to resign his command. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 31 March 1874, he was appointed a Groom in Waiting to the Queen on 26 May 1874.

Promoted to rear admiral on 12 November 1876, Commerell became second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet, with his flag in the armoured frigate HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot;, in July 1877. This was a time of great tension in the region with the Russo-Turkish War at its peak. He then became Junior Naval Lord in the Second Disraeli ministry in December 1879 where he sat until the Government fell in May 1880. In the 1880 general election he stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Southampton.

Promoted to vice admiral on 19 January 1881, Commerell became Commander in Chief, North America and West Indies Station, with his flag in the armoured cruiser HMS &quot;Northampton&quot;, in November 1882. At the 1885 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for the Southampton seat, which he held until he resigned from the House of Commons on 15 May 1888. As a member of parliament he lobbied hard for the Naval Defence Bill.

Promoted to full admiral on 12 April 1886, Commerell became was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887 and became Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in June 1888. He was appointed a Groom in Waiting to the Queen again on 31 December 1891.

Commerell was promoted to admiral of the fleet on 14 February 1892, advanced to the Turkish Order of the Medjidie, first class on 5 March 1894 and retired in January 1899. On 4 February 1901 he was made a Grand Cross of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. He died at his home at Rutland Gate in London on 21 May 1901 and was buried at Cheriton Road Cemetery, Folkestone. Edmund Rock and Commerell Point in British Columbia, Canada, were named in his honour. His Victoria Cross is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Family==
In 1853 Commerell married Matilda Bushby; they had three daughters. His brother, William, was a first-class cricketer.

<doc id="1196017" wikidata="Q830309" url="?curid=1196017" title="Best Off Skyranger">
<text>The Best Off Skyranger is a French-designed two-seat ultralight utility aircraft, produced by Best Off, of Toulouse. It is a high-wing conventional monoplane with tricycle undercarriage, and of fabric-covered tubular construction.

The Skyranger is also manufactured under licence by Aero Bravo in Brazil, SkyRanger Aircraft in the United States (as a kit), Aeros in Ukraine and at least 150 were built by Synairgie in France, too.

Some 900 are flying throughout the world.

==Variants==
;Skyranger
:Original model, introduced 1990.
;Skyranger Vfun
:Renamed original model for the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale microlight class. Standard engines available are the Rotax 582 two-stroke, the Rotax 912UL, the Rotax 912ULS, Jabiru 2200, the VW and the HKS 700E four-stroke powerplants. The aircraft has also been equipped with the JLT Motors Ecoyota engine.
;Skyranger Vmax
:Improved model for United Kingdom BCAR Section &quot;S&quot; certification, with ventral fin. Standard engines available are the Rotax 582 two-stroke, the Rotax 912UL, the Rotax 912ULS, Jabiru 2200, the VW and the HKS 700E four-stroke powerplants.
;Skyranger Swift
:Improved model based on the Vmax for the US light-sport aircraft market, with reduced wingspan.
;Reusable Bomber Drones
:On 26 April 2024, 6 photos surfaced online, taken somewhere in Russia, which appeared to show a crashed Skyranger Swift 2 fitted with a single OFAB-100-120 bomb. Along with other equipment to allow for it to become a “remotely piloted bomber”. Skyranger had been contacted and said it could be an existing aircraft or one built from a kit worth $55,000.00. Ukraine has previously modified a Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat into a kamikaze drone.

<doc id="1196020" wikidata="Q21680473" url="?curid=1196020" title="List of interactive geometry software">
<text>Interactive geometry software (IGS) or dynamic geometry environments (DGEs) are computer programs which allow one to create and then manipulate geometric constructions, primarily in plane geometry. In most IGS, one starts construction by putting a few points and using them to define new objects such as lines, circles or other points. After some construction is done, one can move the points one started with and see how the construction changes.

== History ==

The earliest IGS was the Geometric Supposer, which was developed in the early 1980s. This was soon followed by Cabri in 1986 and The Geometer&#x27;s Sketchpad.

== Comparison ==

There are three main types of computer environments for studying school geometry: supposers, dynamic geometry environments (DGEs) and Logo-based programs. Most are DGEs: software that allows the user to manipulate (&quot;drag&quot;) the geometric object into different shapes or positions. The main example of a supposer is the Geometric Supposer, which does not have draggable objects, but allows students to study pre-defined shapes. Nearly all of the following programs are DGEs. For a related, comparative physical example of these algorithms, see Lenart Sphere.

==Continuity versus determinism==

All these programs can be divided into two category: deterministic and continuous.
GeoGebra can be deterministic or continuous (one can change it in preferences).

All constructions in the deterministic programs (GSP, Cabri, Kseg and most of others) are completely determined by the given points but the result of some constructions can jump or behave unexpectedly when a given point is moved.

On the contrary, some constructions in continuous programs (so far only Cinderella and GeoGebra), depend on the number of hidden parameters and in such a way that moving a given point produces a continuous motion of the construction, as a result, if the point is moved back to the original position the result of construction might be different.

Here is a test to check whether a particular program is continuous:

Construct the orthocenter of triangle and three midpoints (say &quot;A&#x27;, B&#x27; C&#x27; &quot; ) between vertices and orthocenter.

Construct a circumcircle of &quot;A&#x27;B&#x27;C&#x27; &quot;.

This is the nine-point circle, it intersects each side of the original triangle at two points: the base of altitude and midpoint. Construct an intersection of one side with the circle at midpoint now move opposite vertex of the original triangle, if the constructed point does not move when base of altitude moves through it that probably means that your program is continuous.

Although it is possible to make a deterministic program which behaves continuously in this and similar simple examples, in general it can be proved that no program can be continuous and deterministic at the same time.

<doc id="1196025" wikidata="Q1078015" url="?curid=1196025" title="Kanō Motonobu">
<text>was a Japanese painter and calligrapher. He was a member of the Kanō school of painting. Through his political connections, patronage, organization, and influence he was able to make the Kanō school into what it is today. The system was responsible for the training of a great majority of painters throughout the Edo period (1603–1868). After his death, he was referred to as Kohōgen (古法眼).

==Family background==
The Kanō family are presumed to be the descendants from a line of warriors from the Kanō district. The Kanō district is now called Shizuoka Prefecture. The forebear of this family was Kanō Kagenobu. He seems to have been a retainer of the Imagawa family. It has been reported that he painted a picture of Mount Fuji for a visit to the &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshinori in 1432. The Kanō family dominated the painting world from the end of the Muromachi period (1336–1573) to the end of the Edo period (1603–1868).

Kanō Masanobu, Motonobu&#x27;s father, was the founder of the Kanō school. Kanō Masanobu was the official court painter to the Ashikaga shogunate in 1481. Masanobu was a professional artist whose style derived from the &quot;Kanga&quot; style (Chinese-style ink painting). Masanobu’s descendants were the people that made up the Kanō school. The Kanō school had secular ink painters.

==Career==
At the age of 10 years old, he become an attendant of general Yoshihisa Ashikaga, and it is said that he served Yoshizumi Ashikaga.

Since Kanō Motonobu was a son and heir of the founder of the Kanō School, Kanō Masanobu, he was likely trained in &quot;Kanga&quot; (Chinese-style ink painting) by his father. Right away Motonobu showed great promise as an artist and procured several commissions from major patrons as early as nine years old. Such patrons include the Ashikaga shogunate, members of the imperial aristocracy, Kyoto merchant class, and major Kyoto shrines and temples.

One of his earliest documented contracts was for a set of votive plaques (e-ma) depicting for the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals for the Shinto shrine of Itsukushima. It was commissioned by a group of Sakai merchants in 1515 and the pieces are now located in Hiroshima Prefecture.

By the 1530s Motonobu had married the daughter of the head of the Tosa School of painting, Tosa Mitsunobu, had three sons (Shōei [1519–1592], Yusetsu [1514–1562], and Joshin), and lead a small Kanō sect in northern Kyoto. The workshop contains roughly ten people containing Motonobu, his three sons, Motonobu’s younger brother Yukinobu (1513–1575), and some assistants that might have not been blood related. Since Motonobu was the head or chief architect of these paintings he took on the contracting, production, and organization of the projects while still being very involved with the marketing of his work and his studio. Known for his charm and intellect, Motonobu became a fierce businessman, and frequently petitioned to the shogun for a vast amount of varied commissions with his fellow merchant, Hasuike Hideaki.

Motonobu is a painter who survived the turbulent world of the Warring States period while receiving the patronage of the influential people of the time, such as the shogunate, the imperial court, Ishiyama Hongan-ji, and the influential townspeople.

However, the time he spent marketing did not deter him from his paintings. As head of the Kanō school, he took the most important rooms in a building commissioned, and then assigned his son and assistants other projects based on hierarchy. These projects could be painting their own rooms independently or grinding pigments, preparing the paper, painting the background color, or simply filled in large areas of color. As a result of Motonobu&#x27;s marketing skills, the commissions grew allowing the workshop and school itself to expand. Motonobu trained his workshop which was full of members of his family and other apprentices to execute his many designs. The workshop trained other artists by watching the master painter work and emphasised recreating their master&#x27;s style.

As a professional painter, he left works in a variety of genres, including portraits such as that of &quot;Iio Munegi&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) and the &quot;Kamo Shimba Zukaku&quot; (votive tablet depicting a horse) for the Kamo Shrine in Hyogo Prefecture, both of which are still extant.

==Style==
Motonobu was known for his Chinese monochromatic style and characteristic brushwork, pioneering the suiboku-ga (sumi-e) painting style in Japan. The forms were organic, natural, and full of drama. Motonobu&#x27;s commissions were generally designed for in the home of the samurai warrior class, focusing on &quot;fusuma&quot; and &quot;byōbu&quot;. His sumi-e style paintings are reported to take inspiration from three distinct Chinese masters of the sumi-e technique, Mu-ch&#x27;i Fa-ch&#x27;ang, Hsia Kuei, and Yü Chien (c. 1230).

However, he was versatile in his painting and was able to produce landscapes, scenery, and figures of bold decorative patterns. This was likely due to his father-in-law being head of the Tosa school, Tosa Mitsunobu, who was famous for his revival of the &quot;yamato-e&quot; style. Noted works in the &quot;yamato-e&quot; style include a set of hand scrolls &quot;Seiryō-ji no engi&quot; (&quot;Origins of Seiryō-ji&quot;, 1515; Kyoto, Seiryō-ji), and some &quot;fusuma&quot; wall paintings. By mastering these two distinct styles, Motonobu&#x27;s artistic skills could be tailored to match his respective patron and create a unique fusion of Chinese and Japanese style. This fusion of Chinese style and iconography with Japanese aesthetics is what helped the Kanō school achieve the legendary status it is known for today.

He also was a master in calligraphy, specifically the formal style known as &quot;shintai&quot; (&quot;new form&quot;), the more informal form known as &quot;gyōsho&quot; (&quot;running style&quot;), and the running style &quot;sōsho&quot; (&quot;grass&quot;, very cursive style).

==Legacy==
One of Motonobu&#x27;s greatest achievements was the creation of a new technique for painting. This technique formed the basis for the early Kanō school style. It was known as wa-kan, a mixture of Japanese and Chinese painting. This combination had the spatial solidity and careful brushwork techniques of &quot;Kanga&quot;. It also had some of the characteristics of &quot;Yamato-e&quot; style, for instance, the fine line and decorative patterning, use of colors, and gold leaf. The wall panels depicting &quot;Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons&quot; shows this combination of styles.

He taught other generations everything he learned. This established some creativity and flexibility in the Kanō school. &quot;The Story of Xiang yan&quot; (Tokyo National Museum) shows the emergence of Kanō style, although it has an underlying Chinese philosophy to it. But the figure in the foreground is active and the vertical plane makes the painting Japanese. The brushwork and compositional elements also make the painting appear distinctively Japanese.

The Kanō school flourished because of leaders like Motonobu. His reputation, talent and developed organizational skills made this possible. Though the school was founded in the 15th century, its impact can still be felt in modern art across the world.

<text>Car Wash is a 1976 American comedy film directed by Michael Schultz from a screenplay by Joel Schumacher, and starring an ensemble cast. Originally conceived as a musical, the film is an episodic comedy about a day in the lives of a close-knit group of employees at a Los Angeles car wash. It features Franklyn Ajaye, George Carlin, Irwin Corey, Ivan Dixon, Bill Duke, Antonio Fargas, Jack Kehoe, Clarence Muse, Lorraine Gary, The Pointer Sisters, Richard Pryor, and Garrett Morris. 

The film was one of several Black-focused films produced by a major Hollywood studio during the 1970s. It was released by Universal Pictures on September 3, 1976. It won the Technical Grand Prize at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. 

Despite lukewarm commercial performance on initial release, the film received widespread positive reviews from critics and has developed a strong cult following. The film is also noted for its Grammy Award-winning soundtrack by the funk group Rose Royce.

==Plot==
Over a single Friday in July, the Dee-Luxe Car Wash welcomes all manner of strange and unusual visitors. A hysterical wealthy woman from Beverly Hills arrives with a carsick son. Money-hungry evangelist &quot;Daddy Rich,&quot; who preaches a pseudo-gospel of prosperity theology, appears with his loyal (and singing) entourage, The Wilson Sisters. The employees must also deal with a man they believe is the notorious &quot;pop bottle bomber&quot; being sought that day by the police. It alarms employees, customers, and the owner of the car wash, Leon &quot;Mr. B&quot; Barrow, but the strange man&#x27;s &quot;bomb&quot; turns out to be simply a urine sample he is taking to the hospital for a liver test.

Mr. B&#x27;s son Irwin, a left-wing college student who smokes pot in the men&#x27;s restroom and carries around a copy of &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao&quot;, insists on spending a day with the &quot;working class&quot; employees, whom he considers &quot;brothers&quot; in the &quot;struggle.&quot; As he prepares for work, he sets off motion sensors that give him the first &quot;human car wash,&quot; which he good-naturedly accepts (though while pot-induced). A taxi driver searches fruitlessly for a prostitute named Marleen, who stiffed him for a fare earlier and has her own hopes shattered later on as a customer with whom she apparently has fallen in love has given her a false telephone number. Abdullah Mohammed Akbar, formerly known as Duane, is a tall Black revolutionary and recent convert to Islam who dismisses Daddy Rich&#x27;s preaching when the quartet visits and collects donations from the employees. Middle-aged ex-convict Lonnie, the foreman of the car wash, tries to mentor Abdullah while struggling to raise two young children and fend off his parole officer. Abdullah confronts the flamboyant homosexual Lindy and sharply criticizes his cross-dressing, to which Lindy replies, &quot;Honey, I am more man than you&#x27;ll ever be and more woman than you&#x27;ll ever get.&quot;

Theodore Chauncey &quot;T.C.&quot; Elcott, another young employee, is determined to win a radio call-in contest to win tickets for a rock concert and to convince his estranged girlfriend Mona, a waitress working in a diner across the street, to accompany him, eventually succeeding. Musicians Floyd and Lloyd, who have an audition for an agent when their shift ends, rehearse their jazz-blues dance moves in front of bewildered customers. An employee named Justin clashes with his girlfriend, Loretta, who wants him to return to college, but he declines, feeling that a black man like him will not get anywhere in the world with any kind of education. His elderly grandfather, Snapper, works as the shoe shine man at the car wash and is a Daddy Rich follower.

Other employees include womanizer Geronimo (&quot;married three and a half times&quot;), a thin African-American with feathers in his hair; cowboy Scruggs, the gas pump operator concerned about having caught a &quot;social disease&quot; the night before; overweight, good-natured Hippo, who is constantly listening to his transistor radio and hooks up with Marleen; a scheming, jokester Latino named Chuco; a Native American named Goody, who wears a home made hat with pig face, tail, and pointy ears; scruffy, middle-aged Charlie; con artist and bookie Sly, who later gets arrested for a series of unpaid parking tickets; and the &quot;holier than thou&quot; Earl, who sees himself as superior to his colleagues because he does not get wet (since he waxes the cars).

Among everything, Mr. B constantly flirts with the young, busty cashier/receptionist Marsha to escape his troubled home life. Constantly tense, he worries about his car wash going out of business due to a competitor a few miles down the street. Lonnie, conversely, has numerous ideas on how to save the car wash, but everyone else, including the miserly Mr. B, ignores him. Later, Abdullah, after being fired by Mr. B for his unexplained absences from work for the past several weeks, appears in the office with a gun while Lonnie is closing up, intending to rob the business. Lonnie dissuades him, knowing where a life of crime will lead. The day ends melancholically as everyone goes their separate ways.

==Cast==
===Other actors===
Danny DeVito and Brooke Adams appeared in the film as Joe and Terry, the owners of a food stand called &#x27;Big Joe&#x27;s Dog House&#x27;, which is located next to the car wash. Though they had speaking roles, nearly all of their scenes were deleted from the theatrical version, and they were only seen in the background. Their scenes were restored for the edited television version.

The film also featured the speaking voices of local L.A. disc jockeys Jay Butler, J. J. Jackson, Rod McGrew, Sarina C. Grant, and Cleveland&#x27;s Billy Bass, all heard in the film&#x27;s background on the fictional &quot;KGYS&quot; radio station.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
The producers originally intended the project to be a stage production, which would feature a replicate car wash on stage, hoping that the project, if successful, could be adapted as a movie. They pitched the idea to Universal&#x27;s then-president Ned Tanen, who persuaded them to make the film version instead. Joel Schumacher was chosen to write based on his work writing &quot;Sparkle&quot;.

===Music===

Unusual for film production, the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced. The director wanted the actors to actually listen to the same music that would later be added in post-production while filming the scenes.

&quot;Car Wash&quot;, recorded by Rose Royce, was a major success, yielding three Billboard R&amp;B Top Ten singles: &quot;Car Wash&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Get Next to You&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Going Down&quot;. The title track, written and produced by Norman Whitfield, was a #1 hit and was one of the biggest hit singles of the disco era. Meanwhile, The Pointer Sisters&#x27; &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot; — which the group performed during their cameo in the film — was a Top Twenty R&amp;B hit.

The &quot;Car Wash&quot; soundtrack won a 1977 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album.

===Versions===
&quot;Car Wash&quot; had its network television premiere on &quot;NBC Monday Night at the Movies&quot; in 1978. Along with the standard dubbing of strong language, many scenes that included the gay character Lindy (Fargas) were trimmed or deleted. To replace these shortened scenes, and therefore shortened film, a subplot of a diner owner (Danny DeVito) (scenes shot for the theatrical version but cut prior to release) were re-inserted. As of 2013, commercially available versions of the movie were of the original theatrical release, not the revised TV version.

===Adaptations===
In 2024, NBC launched a project to revive &quot;Car Wash&quot; through a TV series.

==Reception==
The film presently has a score of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews, with an average score of 6.8 out of 10.

Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it &quot;a sunny, lively comedy&quot; with a &quot;tremendous sense of life.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a cheerful, somewhat vulgar, very cleverly executed comedy,&quot; adding, &quot;Nothing terribly dramatic happens, and some of the comedy gets a bit forced, but the wonder of the film is how it manages to succeed so much of the time.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four and called it &quot;quite entertaining&quot; with &quot;plenty of strong performances.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;An enormous, and enormously talented, cast is put through its paces masterfully by director Michael Schultz, making the most of Joel Schumacher&#x27;s zany screenplay.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a high-energy, high-entertainment, raucously well-observed slice of life.&quot; Sander Vanocur of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;more than a movie. It&#x27;s an experience that will make you feel good.&quot;

While it did well at the box office, it still fell short of the high expectations Universal had, probably because of the declining market for black-oriented films at the time. Since the film&#x27;s initial release, it has had a small but constant following as a cult film, with some notable disciples including Michael Bay and Sandford Bay.

Gay film historian Vito Russo cites the character Lindy, played by Antonio Fargas, as being both funny and challenging through his gay militancy. Russo deems Lindy&#x27;s response to the militant Abdullah as being potentially revolutionary had it not been placed strictly within a comedic context. African American cultural critic Angela Nelson identifies Lindy as a &quot;sophisticated sissy.&quot; The &quot;sophisticated sissy&quot; characterization is often used as an easy contrast to the &quot;appropriate&quot; masculine behavior that heterosexual black male characters are expected to display.

They played their home games at Municipal Stadium which was opened in 1930 and seated 4,600 people. The team mascot was Woolie, a giant woolly bear caterpillar.

== History ==
=== Toronto Blue Jays (1993–2000) ===
The ownership of the previous Double A Hagerstown Suns chose to move their existing Hagerstown franchise to Bowie as the Bowie Baysox. Hagerstown would not go without, though. Winston Blenckstone immediately relocated his Myrtle Beach Hurricanes franchise in the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to Hagerstown after the 1992 season and promptly renamed them the Suns.

The change brought a competitive team to Hagerstown for the 1993 season. The offense got steady power production from Mike Coolbaugh, who led the team with 16 home runs. The best all-around hitter on the team proved to be D.J. Boston. Boston hit .315 with 13 home runs and 93 runs batted in (RBI). Those numbers were good enough to earn him league Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. Two outfielders, Rickey Cradle and Jose Herrera, put together solid seasons at the plate for the Suns. Herrera hit .317 in 95 games, while Cradle belted 13 home runs. Brad Cornett led the team in earned run average (ERA), with a 2.40 mark, and also innings pitched, with 172.1. Silva went 12–4 with a 2.52 ERA in 142.2 innings. In that time frame, Silva struck out 161 batters.

In 1994, the Suns reached the playoffs for the first time since 1991. On offense, the team was led by former first round draft choice Shannon Stewart. Stewart hit .324 with 4 home runs and 25 RBI in an injury-shortened season. Tom Evans returned from the 1993 squad, hitting .273 with 13 home runs and 48 RBI in 95 games. The power was supplied by Lorenzo Delacruz and Ryan Jones, who hit 19 and 18 home runs, respectively. Jones also had a team leading 72 RBI. Edwin Hurtado went 11–2 with a 2.95 ERA in 33 games, 16 of which were starts. The bullpen was headlined by Steve Sinclair and Dave Sinnes. Sinclair appeared in 37 games out of the bullpen and picked up a total of 9 wins with 105 innings pitched. Sinclair only made one start for the Suns all year. Closer Sinnes tied for the South Atlantic League lead with 37 saves.

In 1995, veteran Jeff Ladd was the home run leader on the team. Ladd hit 19 home runs in 95 games before a promotion to Double-A Knoxville. That turned out to be Ladd&#x27;s last professional season. Bobby Llanos hit 17 home runs and produced a team leading 63 RBI. The Suns got stable production behind the plate from Julio Mosquera. Mosquera hit .291 in 108 games for the team. Brian Smith pitched his way to a 9–1 record in 47 games out of the bullpen and picked up 21 saves along the way. He also had 101 strikeouts in 104 innings. Doug Meiners proved to be the Suns&#x27; best starter of the season. He went 8–4 with a 2.99 ERA in 18 starts. Another highlight from the starting staff was Tom Davey, who went 4–1 with a 3.38 ERA in 8 starts.

The 1996 campaign was the Suns&#x27; first losing year in the SAL. First basemen Mike Whitlock led the team in home runs (20) and RBI (91) with a .252 batting average while drawing a franchise record 108 walks. He did this in 131 games at the age of 19, yet never played a game in the major leagues. Another player who displayed power was Craig Wilson. Wilson hit 11 home runs with 70 RBI while maintaining a .261 batting average. Craig Stone returned from the 1995 squad, batting .310 with 10 home runs and 35 RBI in 56 games. Mike Johnson won a staff-leading 11 games and also had a team-leading total of 162.2 innings pitched. He made his major league debut a season later with the Baltimore Orioles. Tom Davey won 10 games and had a 3.87 ERA in 26 starts.

In 1997, the offense was led by Luis Lopez, who put together one of the best individual years by a Sun ever. Lopez batted .358 with 11 home runs and 99 RBI. These numbers would give him SAL MVP honors. The pitching staff was led by Clint Lawrence, who won a team-leading 13 games in 26 starts. One pitcher who had a bizarre season was starter Gary Glover. Glover posted a 3.73 ERA and threw a team leading 173.2 innings. He, along with John Bale, tied for the team lead in strikeouts with 155. Despite these advantages, his overall record was 6–17. Those 17 losses set a franchise record. The Suns finished in last place, 11 games behind first place Charleston (West Virginia).

The 1998 offense got power from catcher/first basemen Bobby Cripps. Cripps hit 29 home runs and also led the Suns with 88 RBI and threw out 47 percent of would-be base stealers in 56 games behind the plate. Mike Young batted .282 with 16 home runs and 86 RBI at second base. Two other future major league All Stars on the Suns that year were Vernon Wells and César Izturis. Wells batted .285 with 11 home runs and 65 RBI. Izturis meanwhile had a .262 average with a team-leading 20 stolen bases. John Sneed had one of the best seasons ever by a Suns pitcher, as he won a franchise record 16 games, while losing just 2, with a 2.56 ERA in 27 starts. He also collected 200 strikeouts in 161.1 innings pitched. Clayton Andrews returned from the 1997 squad and nearly matched Sneed&#x27;s dominance. He went 10–7 with a 2.28 ERA and had 193 strikeouts in 162 innings pitched. The Suns closer was Jaron Seabury, who had a 1.65 ERA in 45 games with 17 saves. The Suns won the first-half division title and finished with the best record in the Northern Division. They made the playoffs and won in the first round, but did not advance to the championship because the league now had a three-round playoff format featuring 8 out of 14 teams. In the second round, the Suns would lose to the eventual league champion Capital City Bombers.

In 1999, Jay Gibbons was the best all-around hitter. In 71 games, Gibbons batted .305 with 16 home runs and 69 RBI. Second basemen Jorge Nunez batted .268 with 14 home runs and 61 RBI, while leading the team with 51 stolen bases. Outfielder Ryan Fleming hit .335 in 61 games. Tyler Thompson led the team with 17 homeruns and RBI with 81. Pasqual Coco went 9–1 in 14 starts with a 2.21 ERA. Scott Cassidy won a team-leading 13 games in 27 starts in 170.2 innings. He struck out 178 batters, leading the team. The Suns bullpen got a strong season from closer Jarrod Kingrey. Kingrey had 27 saves and 69 strikeouts in 61 innings. he Suns made the playoffs by winning the first-half division title and wound up with the best overall record in the SAL. They were knocked out of the first round by their division rival, the Cape Fear Crocs. This was the last season that the SAL used a three division (North, Central, and South) format.

The Suns had a losing season in 2000. Reed Johnson hit .290 with 8 home runs and 70 RBI in 95 games. Kevin Cash led the team in home runs with 10, while also contributing 27 RBI in 59 games. He displayed great defense by throwing out 55 percent of potential base stealers. Shortstop Brandon Jackson led the team with a .312 batting average, while outfielder Shannon Carter stole a team-leading 33 bases. Marcos Sandoval led the Suns with 163.2 innings pitched, while Travis Hubbel posted a 3.89 ERA in 19 starts. Matt Ford, a 19-year-old left-hander, went 5–3 with a 3.87 ERA in 18 games, 14 of which were starts. He struck out 86 batters in 83 innings with the team. Rob Hamman picked up 8 wins while pitching in 34 games, but only one of them was a start. The most unusual aspect of the season was the bench–clearing brawl that occurred in July against the Columbus Red Stixx at Municipal Stadium. The Suns were losing when Reed Johnson was hit by a pitch that caused outfielder Auntwan Riggins to charge the pitcher from the dugout. The brawl led to so many ejections that Columbus was unable to field a full team and had to forfeit the game to the Suns. Officially, Hagerstown was declared the game&#x27;s winner by a 9–1 score.

=== San Francisco Giants (2001–2004) ===
The 2001 season brought on a lot of changes for the Hagerstown Suns. After eight seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays, the team switched its parent club to the San Francisco Giants. The team was also sold to Andy Rayburn. On the field, the Suns returned to winning. The offense got power from Dan Trumble, who led the team with 26 home runs. Outfielder Jason Ellison put together a good season, as he batted .291 with a team leading 19 stolen bases in 130 games. Adam Shabala would post a solid .313 batting average in a span of 70 games. The pitching staff was the best that the Suns had since joining the South Atlantic League, as two pitchers won over 10 games. Boof Bonser tied the Suns&#x27; record for wins in a season with 16, while losing just 4 games. He also struck out 178 batters in 134 innings, earning him the South Atlantic League Pitcher of the Year Award. Another player with 10 plus wins was Jeff Clark. Clark would go 14–9 while posting a solid 3.65 Earned Run Average (ERA) in 27 games. The most impressive season for the Suns may have come out of the bullpen, as closer Jackson Markert put together a memorable year. Markert broke the Suns&#x27; save record by picking up 39 saves and posting a 2.82 ERA. His success was a big reason why the Suns advanced to the playoffs. After winning the Northern Division second-half title, the Suns entered the playoffs, but came up short as Lexington swept them in two games.

The Suns missed the playoffs in 2002, suffering a losing record. Tyler Von Schell led the Suns in home runs with 14. Julian Benavidez led the way in RBIs. Brandon Florence may have been the best all-around hitter on the team with an batting average of .303, with 11 home runs, and 63 RBI in 109 games. On the pitching side, Anthony Pannone led the Suns with nine wins and led innings pitched with 168.2. Ryan Hannaman put together a nice season with a 2.80 ERA and 145 strikeouts in 131.2 innings. Suns fans also saw a glimpse of what was to come with Francisco Liriano. Liriano went 3–6, but had a 3.59 ERA and struck out 85 batters in 80 innings as an 18-year-old. The Suns finished 20.5 games back of the first place, and eventual league champions Hickory Crawdads. Mandalay Entertainment Group purchased the team from Andy Rayburn.

The team scraped together a winning season in 2003 but did not make the playoffs. The Suns&#x27; best power hitter in 2003 was Carlos Sosa, who led the team in both homeruns and RBI with 10 and 63. Derin McMains hit a solid .289 in 54 games before he was promoted to High-A San Jose. Brian Buscher would come to the Suns in the second half and hit .275 in 54 games. The strength of the Suns in 2003 lied in their pitching staff, in which several pitchers had great seasons. Merkin Valdez went 9–5 with a 2.25 ERA in 26 starts. He also led the Suns in innings pitched with 156, and strikeouts with 166. Josh Habel led the team with 11 wins in 36 games, 16 of which were starts. Habel also accumulated 127 strikeouts in 122 innings. Brian Stirm was also solid, as he went 8–5 with a 2.86 ERA in 17 games. Other noteworthy starters for the Suns in 2003 were Clay Hensley and Matt Cain. Hensley went 4–3 with 3.18 ERA in 12 starts before he was promoted to High–A San Jose, but one start in particular was noteworthy. On May 3, 2003, Hensley threw the Suns&#x27; only perfect game. He did this by retiring 21 consecutive batters in the second game of a double header against the Kannapolis Intimidators. Meanwhile, Matt Cain went 4–4 in 14 starts with the Suns, while posting a 2.55 ERA. He struck out 90 batters in just 74 innings. In the bullpen, Matt Palmer would have a great season as he went 5–0 with a 1.20 ERA and 25 saves. The Suns pitching staff in 2003 stands out among the best in franchise history.

The 2004 season turned out to be one of the worst seasons for the Suns. They finished in last place in the South Atlantic League North Division, 34.5 games behind the eventual league champion Hickory Crawdads. In his short stay with the team, Nate Schierholtz proved to be the best hitter. He batted .289 with 15 homeruns and 54 RBI in just 59 games. Another productive hitter on the team that year was Travis Ishikawa. Ishikawa had exactly the same home run and RBI total as Schierholtz, with a .257 average in 97 games. Both players were promoted to High-A San Jose before the season&#x27;s end. Designated hitter Jason Columbus led the team in RBI with 87. The Suns&#x27; leader in wins was Juan Serrato, who compiled 8 wins in 26 games, 21 of which were starts. The Suns&#x27; best all-around pitcher in 2004 was reliever Joe Bateman. Bateman went 7–5 with a 2.14 ERA in 36 games. He picked up 81 strikeouts in just 70 innings of work before he was promoted to Double-A Norwich. One pitcher of note in the Suns bullpen was Brian Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s numbers in Hagerstown were not impressive, 2–5 with a 5.34 ERA in 23 games and 3 starts. However, Wilson&#x27;s later major league performances earned him a spot in the Hagerstown Suns Hall of Fame.

=== New York Mets (2005–2006) ===
Hagerstown once again changed affiliates in 2005, initiating a two-year stint with the New York Mets. Minor League Baseball teams are known for their promotions, and the Suns had one consistent with the cold weather that Hagerstown has early in the baseball season. The Suns unveiled their &quot;Eskimo Day&quot; promotion including giving every fan a free ice cube and granting free admission to fans indigenous to Alaska, Canada, or any place where Eskimos are part of the culture. There was also a special contest for fans at the ballpark: guessing how long it would take a bucket of ice to melt. On the field, the season began with a seven-game winning streak. On May 8, Hagerstown and Asheville combined for 35 runs in the Suns&#x27; 19–16 victory. Hagerstown broke a 16–16 tie with three runs in the 12th inning. The clubs set a South Atlantic League record with 20 extra-base hits, while the 41 hits–23 for Hagerstown—matched a league mark. Also in May, Hagerstown committed seven errors in a game against Delmarva. In June, the Suns qualified for the playoffs in dramatic fashion. Pitcher Gaby Hernandez&#x27;s 115–pitch no-hitter in a 1–0 win over the West Virginia Power on June 19 set up a one-game playoff between the Suns and Lexington Legends on June 25 for the first-half crown. Both teams completed the first–half regular schedule with 42–28 records. In the one game playoff, the Suns defeated the Legends, 9–4, with Hernandez again taking the mound and the win. The Suns slumped badly during the second half of the season, finishing last in the Northern Division. In September however, Hagerstown won the Northern Division by defeating the second-half Northern Division champion Delmarva Shorebirds two games to one. The Suns were ultimately unsuccessful in their quest for the South Atlantic League championship, losing to the Kannapolis Intimidators, three games to one.

The Suns&#x27; prowess in promotions was recognized in 2006 with the award of the &quot;Veeckie&quot; Award from &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; for their &quot;They even gave away the Kitchen Sink&quot; kitchen sink giveaway promotion. The award, named after famous baseball promoter Bill Veeck, is given annually by the magazine to recognize the industry&#x27;s top promotions each season. The Suns have received a &quot;Veeckie&quot; in three of the previous five years. Earlier winning promotions included the Guinness World Record for the Youngest Broadcaster ever (2002) and the Free Funeral Giveaway (2003), which was also selected as the Promotion of the Year by &quot;ESPN the Magazine&quot; and was named as one of the top five baseball promotions of all time by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. The most noteworthy event on the field was an 8–7 loss at Lakewood, a 22-inning marathon that took nearly a week and a half to complete. The game began on April 26, but was called in the 17th inning due to league rules that state an inning cannot be started after 12:30 a.m. It was finally completed on May 6, taking 7 hours and 47 minutes. The 22 innings bested the previous 21-inning South Atlantic League record.

=== Washington Nationals (2007–2020) ===
In 2007, the Suns became a member of the Washington Nationals farm system. The Suns won few games as the talent-poor Nationals organization rapidly promoted Suns players with potential. Of four players selected for the South Atlantic League All-Star Game (Leonard Davis, Cory VanAllen, Mike Daniel, and Chris Marrero), none actually played because they had been promoted to the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals by the time the game occurred. In the promotions area, romance novelist Nora Roberts was honored with a Nora Roberts bobblehead on July 6. Roberts is a resident of Washington County, Maryland, where Hagerstown is located and has been honored by the Suns several times.

There were two significant milestones for the Suns organization in 2008. The first occurred on May 30, when the number 50 was retired in honor of SAL President Emeritus John Henry Moss. Along with the number-retiring ceremony, the Suns honored Moss with a bronze plaque placed in Municipal Stadium, highlighting his 50 years of service to the league. The second milestone occurred on November 13 when Hagerstown native and Suns Director of Business Operations Carol Gehr was selected as the Rawlings Woman Executive of the Year. The Rawlings Award honors an outstanding woman executive from either Major League or Minor League Baseball. Gehr was with the club in many capacities over a 25-year career spanning six different ownership groups.

A bright spot to an otherwise dismal season in 2009 was the performance of catcher Derek Norris. He led the SAL with a .413 on-base percentage and 90 walks while being named the SAL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Major League Prospect. He also finished among the top five in the SAL in homers (23), extra-base hits (53), RBIs (84), runs (78), and slugging percentage (.513). He was selected as the designated hitter to the Class A Topps/MiLB All-Star Team, which includes both A-Advanced and A level leagues.

On July 15, 2010, Hagerstown players Steven Souza and J.R. Higley were suspended for using performance-enhancing drugs. Each received 50-game suspensions after testing positive for methylphenidate and ritalinic acid, performance-enhancing substances in violation of the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Souza was a 2010 SAL All-Star. On the field, Eury Perez&#x27;s four stolen bases in seven innings against Delmarva on August 19 was nominated as one of the Class A games of the year for 2010. Finally, a new ownership group with local ties, Hagerstown Baseball, LLC, purchased the Suns in September 2010 for a reported $6.7 million from Mandalay Sports Entertainment. Mandalay used proceeds of the sale to purchase the Oklahoma City Redhawks Triple-A franchise. The new ownership group is led by Florida businessman and general manager of Polo Trace Country Club Bruce Quinn; Tony Dahbura, corporate vice president of Hub Labels in Hagerstown; Dr. Mitesh Kothari of Hagerstown; and Quinn&#x27;s sister, Sheri.

Two number one draft picks dominated the news for the Hagerstown Suns in 2011. Bryce Harper, the overall first pick in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft, started the season with the Suns. Before he moved to the Double-A Harrisburg Senators in mid-season, he played well enough to be selected for the SAL All-Star Game. Later in the season, the 2009 Major League Baseball draft overall first pick, Stephen Strasburg, pitched at Hagerstown on a rehabilitation assignment.

The 2012 season had a tragic beginning when Mitchell Akers, an 18-year-old high school senior who was working with the team, died on April 11. Sources within the league said he fell off the back of a John Deere Gator at Municipal Stadium and later died from his injuries. On the field, 2012 proved to be a banner year for Suns third baseman Matt Skole. He led the SAL in home runs (27), bases on balls (94), on base percentage (.438), and slugging percentage (.574). In addition, Skole was also elected as the Nationals&#x27; Minor League Player of the Year and the SAL Player of the Year. The Suns made the divisional playoffs; however, they were swept by the defending SAL champion Greensboro Grasshoppers, two games to none. Discussions concerning the relocation of the Hagerstown Suns to Virginia began circulating. A letter from the Washington Nationals was sent to Suns majority owner Bruce Quinn stating that Hagerstown&#x27;s 80-year-old Municipal Stadium was no longer up to Major League Baseball standards. Initially, Quinn began discussions with the Winchester Economic Development Authority to relocate the team to Winchester, Virginia, to begin play in 2014. The negotiations failed in part because of the refusal of the Winchester community to provide public funding for a new stadium

In 2013, Hagerstown led the SAL in the offensive categories of runs scored (692), runs batted in (608), and on base percentage (.341). Improving over 2012, the Suns won the SAL Northern Division, but fell to the Savannah Sand Gnats, three games to one in the league championship. Tony Renda was selected as the initial recipient of the Bob Boone Award, granted to the Washington Nationals&#x27; minor league player &quot;who best demonstrates the professionalism, leadership, loyalty, passion, selflessness, durability, determination, and work ethic required to play the game the Washington Nationals way.&quot; In October 2013, the Suns formally applied to Minor League Baseball to relocate to Fredericksburg, Virginia, for the 2015 season. The Suns and their partners, New Jersey-based Diamond Nation and a Fredericksburg-area automotive company, agreed to purchase a 38-acre stadium site inside the Fredericksburg city limits. The facility was initially planned to be ready for the start of the 2015 season at a cost of $29 million. However, in November 2014 Diamond Nation announced that it was terminating its option to purchase the Suns. A contributing factor in this decision was the increase in estimated cost to build the facility to $53 million.

Hagerstown began the 2014 season with a record of 31 wins and 8 losses, which was the highest winning percentage in the minor leagues. However, the team then went 13–18, finishing with a first-half season record of 44–26. The Greensboro Grasshoppers shared the 44–26 record. However, because Greensboro defeated Hagerstown in three out of four games during the first-half season, Greensboro was awarded the SAL Northern Division first half title. The second-half season proved to be a repeat of the first. Once again, Greensboro and Hagerstown finished in a tie for first, this time with identical 43–27 records. The tie breaker system worked in the Suns&#x27; favor this time, because Hagerstown won five of seven games against Greensboro in the second half. Shining brightest among the Suns&#x27; everyday players in 2014 was SAL Most Valuable Player Wilmer Difo. The middle infielder led the SAL with 176 hits, placed second with 49 stolen bases, and fourth with 90 runs batted in. Additionally, Difo was the recipient of the 2014 Bob Boone Award. Fellow SAL End-of-Season All-Star Rafael Bautista led the league with 69 steals. The pitching was also a team strength, led by Lucas Giolito who was honored as the league&#x27;s top pitcher and top major league prospect. The Suns improved their playoff performance over 2013, but it was still not enough to claim the John Henry Moss Cup, symbolic of the SAL championship. The Suns lost the SAL championship series, three games to two, to the Asheville Tourists.

The most unusual game of 2015 occurred on April 15 when the Suns won a 1–0 game against the West Virginia Power despite having no hits. The lone run in the game crossed the plate in the top of the first inning. The Suns loaded the bases after being issued two walks and one batter getting hit. With two outs, left fielder Jeff Gardner drew a walk to force home right fielder Narciso Mesa from third to score the only run of the game. This was the first minor league no-hitter resulting in defeat in a full-season league since 2008. During the year Suns majority owner Bruce Quinn entered into negotiations with Spotsylvania County, Virginia officials to move the Suns. Quinn proposed a 5,000-seat, $30 million stadium, with $28 million borrowed by the county and $2 million paid by the Suns, who would pay a rent of $175,000 annually. Minor League Baseball gave Quinn until July 31 to complete the deal. The deadline passed with no further action.

The 2016 campaign saw a return to postseason play for Hagerstown as the Suns won the first-half Northern Division title by one-half game over the Delmarva Shorebirds. In the Northern Division championship the Suns were swept 2–0 by the Lakewood BlueClaws. The Suns SAL End-of-Season All-Stars were Kevin Gutierrez (third base), Ian Sagdall (utility infielder), and Patrick Anderson (manager).

There were several noteworthy games during the 2017 season. On April 30, the Suns set a single-game record SAL record with 30 hits in a 22 to 4 victory over the Lexington Legends. Hagerstown and Lexington also tied the SAL record of 42 combined hits during the game. Games from June 1 to June 4 set a four-game series attendance record (22,578) at Municipal Stadium as Tim Tebow visited Hagerstown with the Columbia Fireflies. On June 7, Hagerstown and the Greensboro Grasshoppers played a game at Burlington, North Carolina&#x27;s Burlington Athletic Stadium, home of the short-season rookie Appalachian League Burlington Royals. This was the first full-season Class A game in Burlington since 1964. On Father&#x27;s Day (June 18) in Lexington, inclement weather caused the Suns and Legends to end their game in an unusual 5 to 5 tie. Ross Combs was recognized as the SAL Sales Executive of the Year.

In 2018, Brandon Groomes was recognized as the SAL Batperson of the Year for the fourth year in a row.

2019 was noteworthy in three respects. It was the last year the Suns fielded a team. Patrick Anderson had a record-breaking sixth year managing the team. Finally, the Suns had a record low attendance of 59,686 fans during the season.

=== Team folds ===
Following the cancelled 2020 season, the team announced in an email to season ticket holders on November 21, 2020, that the Washington Nationals were not renewing their affiliation with the Suns. Team General Manager Travis Painter noted, &quot;It is with a heavy heart that I’m writing to let you know that the Washington Nationals have decided not to renew their affiliation with the Hagerstown Suns. This brings 40 years of Hagerstown Suns baseball to a close.&quot; On December 9, 2020, the Nationals announced that the Fredericksburg Nationals, formerly the Potomac Nationals of Woodbridge, Virginia, would take over as the club&#x27;s Low-A affiliate. As part of the minor league restructuring process, Major League Baseball did not invite the Suns to affiliate at any level or with any team, formally ending affiliated minor league baseball in Hagerstown.

<doc id="1196038" wikidata="Q2264905" url="?curid=1196038" title="Rock in a Hard Place">
<text>Rock in a Hard Place is the seventh studio album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released on August 27, 1982, by Columbia Records. It was certified gold on November 10, 1989. It is the only Aerosmith album not to feature lead guitarist Joe Perry, following his departure from the band in 1979. Rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford also left during the recording in 1981. The band spent $1.5 million on the recording of this album, which saw them reunited with producer Jack Douglas.

==Background==
Aerosmith had released six studio albums during the 1970s. But as the decade concluded, multiple problems arose. Guitarist Joe Perry had left the band in 1979 after incidents at the World Series of Rock in Cleveland, Ohio and was replaced by Jimmy Crespo. Meanwhile, Steven Tyler&#x27;s drug abuse increased. After recording the single &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, guitarist Brad Whitford also left Aerosmith in 1981 and was replaced by Rick Dufay when the recording of the album was finally complete.

Guitarist Dufay recalls the difficulty in completing the album in a 2008 interview: &quot;They tried to make that album for two years but Steven couldn&#x27;t finish stuff and they had trouble with their original producer but once they got Jack and me on board, we were just pushing it. When we went down to Florida, Steven was way too fucked up to do anything, he was nodding off when he was trying to write lyrics and I said to Jack that we had to get him out and get him together. It took about two or three months and we pretty much nursed him back to health. We got him off the hard stuff, sat in the sun and had some laughs and I established a bond with him. It&#x27;s pretty well documented on the Behind the Music show. He was pretty sick and I just took care of him and even had to wipe his ass for him!!

An outtake from the album titled “Riff &amp; Roll” was released on their 1991 box set, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;.

==Critical reception ==

From contemporary reviews, J. D. Considine lamented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; how the band had decided to maintain their old sound on the album, despite new heavy rock &quot;fast power chords had made Aerosmith&#x27;s bluesy boogie almost obsolete&quot;. He praised &quot;Perry lookalike Jimmy Crespo&quot;&#x27;s guitar playing, but wrote that &quot;despite an occasional burst of primal energy, much of the LP rocks by rote.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; gave the album a one out of five star rating, opining that &quot;It&#x27;s sad when once-vital hard rock bands outlast their usefulness, if only because there are so few of them around.&quot;

AllMusic Greg Prato wrote that Aerosmith &quot;didn&#x27;t possess the magical chemistry of their &#x27;70s classics&quot; without Perry and Whitford, but the band could &quot;still rock out&quot; producing their &quot;most studio-enhanced and experimental record up to this point&quot; with &quot;a few pleasant surprises&quot;, like &quot;the psychedelicized &#x27;Joanie&#x27;s Butterfly&#x27;&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described the album as &quot;a bit patchy&quot; with highlights being &quot;Jailbait&quot;, &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot; and &quot;Joanie&#x27;s Butterfly&quot; and the rest &quot;variously lumbering, untuneful and forced&quot;, and concluded that, although Aerosmith &quot;could barely function&quot;, they &quot;never made a bad record.&quot; &quot;In theory a disaster,&quot; observed &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, &quot;in practice, an unlikely triumph. Never mind the &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;-anticipating Stonehenge cover – &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; is one kick-ass album… &#x27;Lightning Strikes&#x27;, &#x27;Bolivian Ragamuffin&#x27; and &#x27;Joanie&#x27;s Butterfly&#x27; are classic Aerosmith songs – no matter who played on them.&quot;

&quot;The record doesn&#x27;t suck,&quot; wrote drummer Joey Kramer in his 2009 autobiography, &quot;Hit Hard: A Story of Hitting Rock Bottom at the Top&quot;. &quot;There&#x27;s some real good stuff on it. But it&#x27;s not a real Aerosmith record because it&#x27;s just me, Steven, and Tom [Hamilton] — with a fill-in guitar player... It&#x27;s Jimmy Crespo doing the guitar work.&quot;

<text>The Kingsport Mets were a Minor League Baseball team of the Appalachian League from 1921 to 2020. They were located in Kingsport, Tennessee, and were last named for the team&#x27;s major league affiliate, the New York Mets. The team played its home games at Hunter Wright Stadium which opened in 1995. The Mets previously played at Dobyns-Bennett High School. In 1983, while Dobyns-Bennett&#x27;s field was being renovated, the team temporarily moved to Sarasota, Florida, and played in the Gulf Coast League as the Gulf Coast League Mets.

==History==
The first professional team to hail from Kingsport was the Kingsport Indians who played in the Appalachian League from 1921 to 1925. From 1938 to 1941, the Kingsport team was known as the Cherokees, but changed to the Dodgers in 1942 when the team became a farm team of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers. They reverted to the Cherokees name in 1943 and continued to play under this moniker through 1955. The Kingsport Cherokees competed in the Mountain States League from 1953 to 1954, before returning to the Appalachian League in 1957 as the Kingsport Orioles after two years of dormancy. After another two years on hiatus, Kingsport returned as the Pirates from 1960 to 1963. From 1969 to 1970, they competed as the Kingsport Royals. Notable players during this period include Al Cowens and U L Washington.

From 1974 to 1979, they were known as the Braves. As an Atlanta Braves affiliate, multiple future major leaguers played for them, including Matt Sinatro, Rick Behenna, Jose Alvarez, Steve Bedrosian, Paul Runge, Brad Komminsk, Milt Thompson, Brook Jacoby, and Mike Payne. Additionally, National League MVP Dale Murphy and Cy Young Award winner Steve Bedrosian played in Kingsport.

In 1980, the team became known as the Kingsport Mets, the name under which the team has competed since then—with the exception of playing the 1983 season in Sarasota, Florida, as the Gulf Coast League Mets while their home stadium underwent renovations. Players Darryl Strawberry, Dwight Gooden, Kevin Mitchell, José Reyes, David Wright, Lastings Milledge, and A. J. Burnett made their professional debuts in Kingsport. The Mets won the Appalachian League Championship in 1988 and 1995.

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Mets were replaced by a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshmen and sophomores.
== All Silver Anniversary Team ==
In 2005, the team selected 14 former players and a manager for its All Silver Anniversary Team in commemoration of 25 years as a Mets affiliate.

<text>The Village Vanguard is a jazz club at Seventh Avenue South in Greenwich Village, New York City. The club was opened on February 22, 1935, by Max Gordon. Originally, the club presented folk music and beat poetry, but it became primarily a jazz music venue in 1957. It has hosted many highly renowned jazz musicians since then, and today is the oldest operating jazz club in New York City.

==History==
===Early years===
Max Gordon opened the Village Vanguard in 1934 on Charles Street and Greenwich Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. He intended it to be a forum for poets and artists as well as a site for musical performances. Due to insufficient facilities, Gordon was refused a cabaret license from the police department and was unable to create the club that he envisioned. In his autobiography he wrote: &quot;I knew if I was ever to get anywhere in the nightclub business, I&#x27;d have to find another place with two johns, two exits, two hundred feet away from a church or synagogue or school, and with the rent under $100 a month.&quot; In 1934, he moved his business and purchased the Golden Triangle, a speakeasy at 178 Seventh Avenue South.

The Golden Triangle opened its doors in 1935. The Golden Triangle&#x27;s basement facility structure resembled that of an isosceles triangle. After purchasing the property, Gordon changed the name of the club to the Village Vanguard.

Like its prototype on Charles Street, the Vanguard was dedicated to poetry readings and folk music. During the 1930s and 1940s, visitors to the club heard poetry read by Maxwell Bodenheim and Harry Kemp, blues and folk music by Lead Belly, and Caribbean calypso by the Duke of Iron. Painters discussed the Spanish Civil War between walls dotted with political posters. Comedians such as Phil Leeds performed stand-up routines.

===Jazz===

Lorraine Gordon, Max Gordon&#x27;s wife, wrote: &quot;The biggest reason my pals and I went to the Vanguard, though, was because there were jazz jam sessions in the afternoons on Sundays. You could go hear Lester Young, Ben Webster, all the greatest jazz musicians for fifty cents at the door, or something like that.&quot; Although jazz was not yet the main attraction at the club, the Vanguard was a haven for small, swing groups. In the 1930s and 1940s, Sidney Bechet, Una Mae Carlisle, Art Hodes, and Mary Lou Williams performed at the Vanguard. According to Lorraine Gordon, &quot;in time, Max began to book acts, often three a night. Many proved to be high-caliber jazzmen.&quot; In 1940, Roy Eldridge performed at the Vanguard. His performance and his dedicated fans raised the possibility that jazz could be the main attraction. As modern jazz developed in the 1940s, small groups began to dominate the Vanguard. College students and artists in Greenwich Village took an interest in jazz. In 1940, a resident trio was formed by Eddie Heywood, Zutty Singleton, and Jimmy Hamilton.

By 1957, as one commentator writes, &quot;Gordon reversed his policy, putting jazz at the top of the bill and letting the folknicks…and the comics…fill it out. Thus the Vanguard booked Miles Davis, Horace Silver, Thelonious Monk, Gerry Mulligan, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Jimmy Giuffre, Sonny Rollins, Anita O&#x27;Day, Charlie Mingus, Bill Evans (a regular), Stan Getz, Carmen McRae.&quot;

The booking of Monk demonstrated the Vanguard&#x27;s ability to take a relatively unknown musician and help launch their career. The story began with the first ever encounter between Max and Lorraine, who met in the Bluebell Bakery, a &quot;homey little Fire Island joint.&quot; After Lorraine walked in and spotted Max (who she knew to be the Vanguard&#x27;s owner), she proposed that he showcase Monk at the club for a week. Max agreed and on September 14, 1948, Monk opened at the Vanguard. The reception was not ideal. &quot;[N]obody came. None of the so-called jazz critics. None of the so-called cognoscenti. Zilch.&quot; But Lorraine continued to sponsor Monk as a genius and, through her persistence, helped him grow into the pillar of jazz he became.

From the 1950s on, the Vanguard was the leading small venue for jazz, launching many celebrated careers and sustaining others that were already aloft. The Thad Jones–Mel Lewis Orchestra that eventually became the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra played on Monday nights between 1966 and 1990.

Max Gordon died on May 11, 1989. The day after, Lorraine closed the Vanguard; the following day, she reopened it and continued to run the place. On June 9, 2018, Lorraine Gordon died of a stroke at age 95.

==Recordings==
The Vanguard helped start many careers and has hosted many recordings that are regarded as masterpieces in its basement, making it now a club of international renown. On 3 November 1957, during some of the first recording sessions at the club, Sonny Rollins, a tenor sax player, recorded three LPs. These recordings were at the forefront of the hard-bop movement. The LPs documented two different saxophone-bass-drums trios. Rollins had shown an interest in smaller ensembles as early as 1955; in Paradox, he exchanged four-measure phrases with drummer Max Roach, with no other instrument taking part. In the Vanguard recordings we hear similar styles in arrangements. In the song &quot;Old Devil Moon&quot;, Rollins is accompanied only by a bassist and a drummer. Musically, this song set the standard for the piano-less trio. Following Rollins, recordings continued; The Gerry Mulligan Concert Jazz Band performed and recorded there in December 1960 after returning from a European Tour. Then there was John Coltrane&#x27;s and Bill Evans&#x27;s Vanguard titles, both from 1961 (Evans was extensively recorded at the Village Vanguard just three months before his death in 1980). Coltrane&#x27;s album was five titles taken from 22 recorded songs over four nights at the Vanguard.
In 1962 &quot;The Cannonball Adderley Sextet in New York&quot; was released. The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra performed every Monday Night beginning in 1965, recording several times, and in 1976 hosted Dexter Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Homecoming&quot; performance with Woody Shaw. Rahsaan Roland Kirk performed several shows at the Vanguard in May 1970 that were compiled for his album &quot;Rahsaan Rahsaan&quot;. During the same year and only four months apart, Pat Patrick and Thelonious Monk played together at the Village Vanguard.

Other recordings include Art Pepper&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Night at the Village Vanguard&quot; (1977), Tommy Flanagan&#x27;s &quot;Nights at the Vanguard&quot; (1986), Vincent Herring&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1993), and Wynton Marsalis&#x27;s seven-disc &quot;Live at the Vanguard&quot; (1999). &quot;The words &#x27;Live at the Village Vanguard&#x27; do have a direct and positive influence on an album&#x27;s sales&quot;, said Bruce Lundvall, president of Blue Note, a jazz label with more than a dozen &quot;Live at the Vanguard&quot; titles in its catalog.

In 2013, Ravi Coltrane, the son of John Coltrane, performed at the Village Vanguard.

Singer Cécile McLorin Salvant recorded many of the songs from her album &quot;Dreams and Daggers&quot; live at the Vanguard. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2018.

<doc id="1196062" wikidata="Q7164463" url="?curid=1196062" title="Penny knife">
<text>The penny knife was a originally a simple 18th century utility knife with a fixed blade. It got the name &quot;penny knife&quot; because it cost 1 penny in England and America towards the end of the 18th century.

The famous &quot;Fuller&#x27;s Penny Knife&quot; helped gain the reputation of Sheffield, England, cutlers in the pre-industrial era of the early 18th century.

==Description==

The &quot;penny knife&quot; later evolved into a basic, mass-produced pocketknife with a folding blade, which pivoted freely in and out of the handle without a backspring or other device to hold it in position (other than the frictional pressures of the knife handle). This type of knife was popular with farmers in the United States, England, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain for much of the 19th and part of the 20th century, and consequently is often called a &quot;farmer knife&quot;, &quot;sodbuster knife&quot;, or &quot;peasant knife&quot;.

Antique penny knives have increased in value and can sell for up to US $500 or 400 Euros.

In modern production, the smallest models of the Opinel, a late 19th-century peasant&#x27;s knife, continue to use this basic design, consisting of a folding blade pivoting on an axle mounted through a steel-bolstered wooden handle.

<doc id="1196068" wikidata="Q154662" url="?curid=1196068" title="Nana Mouskouri">
<text>Ioanna &quot;Nana&quot; Mouskouri ( ; born 13 October 1934) is a Greek singer and politician. Over the span of her career, she has released over 200 albums in at least thirteen languages, including Greek, French, English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Hebrew, Welsh, Mandarin Chinese and Corsican.

Mouskouri became well known throughout Europe for the song &quot;The White Rose of Athens&quot;, recorded first in German as &quot;Weiße Rosen aus Athen&quot; as an adaptation of her Greek song &quot;&quot; (&quot;San sfyríxeis tris forés&quot;, &quot;When you whistle three times&quot;). It became her first record to sell over one million copies.

Later, in 1963, she represented Luxembourg at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;À force de prier&quot;. Her friendship with the composer Michel Legrand led to the recording by Mouskouri of the theme song of the Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. From 1968 to 1976, she hosted her own TV show produced by BBC, &quot;Presenting Nana Mouskouri&quot;. Her popularity as a multilingual television personality and distinctive image, owing to the then unusual signature black-rimmed glasses, turned Mouskouri into an international star.

&quot;Je chante avec toi Liberté&quot;, recorded in 1981, is perhaps her biggest hit to date, performed in at least five languages – French, English as &quot;Song for Liberty&quot;, German as &quot;Lied der Freiheit&quot;, Spanish as &quot;Libertad&quot; and Portuguese as &quot;Liberdade&quot;. &quot;Only Love&quot;, a song recorded in 1984 as the theme song of TV series &quot;Mistral&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, gained worldwide popularity along with its other versions in French (as &quot;L&#x27;Amour en Héritage&quot;), Italian (as &quot;Come un&#x27;eredità&quot;), Spanish (as &quot;La dicha del amor&quot;), and German (as &quot;Aber die Liebe bleibt&quot;). It became her only UK hit single when it reached number two in February 1986.

Mouskouri became a spokesperson for UNICEF in 1993 and was elected to the European Parliament as a Greek deputy from 1994 to 1999. 

In 2006, she was a special guest on Eurovision Song Contest 2006&#x27;s final, presented as the best selling artist of all time.

In 2015, she was awarded the Echo Music Prize for Outstanding achievements by the German music association Deutsche Phono-Akademie.

==Early years==
Nana Mouskouri was born on 13 October 1934 in Chania, Crete, where her father, Constantinos, worked as a film projectionist in a local cinema; her mother, Aliki, worked in the same cinema as an usher. When Mouskouri was three, her family moved to Athens.

Mouskouri&#x27;s family sent her and her older sister Eugenía (Jenny) to the Athens Conservatoire. Although Mouskouri had displayed exceptional musical talent from age six, Jenny initially appeared to be the more gifted sibling. Financially unable to support both girls&#x27; studies, the parents asked their tutor which one should continue. The tutor conceded that Jenny had the better voice, but Nana was the one with the true inner need to sing. Mouskouri has said that a medical examination revealed she has only one functioning vocal cord and this could well account for her remarkable singing voice (in her younger years ranging from a husky, dark alto, which she later dropped, to a ringing coloratura mezzo), as opposed to her breathy, raspy speaking voice.

Mouskouri&#x27;s early childhood was marked by the German Nazi occupation of Greece. Her father became part of the anti-Nazi resistance movement in Athens. Mouskouri began singing lessons at age 12. As a child, she listened to radio broadcasts of singers including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Charles Trenet, Billie Holiday, and Édith Piaf.

In 1950, she was accepted at the Conservatoire. She studied classical music with an emphasis on singing opera. After eight years at the Conservatoire, Mouskouri was encouraged by her friends to experiment with jazz music. She began singing with her friends&#x27; jazz group at night. However, when Mouskouri&#x27;s Conservatory professor found out about Mouskouri&#x27;s involvement with a genre of music that was not in keeping with her classical studies, he prevented her from sitting for her end-of-year exams. 

During an episode of &quot;Joanna Lumley&#x27;s Greek Odyssey&quot;, shown on the UK ITV channel in the autumn of 2011, Mouskouri told the actress Joanna Lumley how she had been scheduled to sing at the amphitheatre at Epidauros with other students of the Conservatoire, when upon arrival at the amphitheatre word came through from the Conservatoire in Athens that she had just been barred from participating in the performance there owing to her involvement in light music. Mouskouri subsequently left the Conservatoire and began performing at the Tzaki club in Athens.

She began singing jazz in nightclubs with a bias towards Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s repertoire. In 1957, she recorded her first song, &quot;Fascination&quot;, in both Greek and English for Odeon/EMI Greece. By 1958 while still performing at the Tzaki, she met Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis. Hadjidakis was impressed by Nana&#x27;s voice and offered to write songs for her. In 1959 Mouskouri performed Hadjidakis&#x27; &quot;Κάπου υπάρχει η αγάπη μου&quot; (&quot;Kápou ipárchi i agápi mou&quot;, &quot;Somewhere my love exists&quot;; co-written with poet Nikos Gatsos) at the inaugural Greek Song Festival. The song won first prize, and Mouskouri began to be noticed.

At the 1960 Greek Song Festival, she performed two more Hadjidakis compositions, &quot;Τιμωρία&quot; (&quot;Timōría&quot;, &quot;Punishment&quot;) and &quot;Κυπαρισσάκι&quot; (&quot;Kyparissáki&quot;, &quot;Little cypress&quot;). Both these songs tied for first prize. Mouskouri performed Kostas Yannidis&#x27; composition, &quot;Ξύπνα αγάπη μου&quot; (&quot;Xýpna agápi mou&quot;, &quot;Wake up, my love&quot;), at the Mediterranean Song Festival, held in Barcelona that year. The song won first prize, and she went on to sign a recording contract with Paris-based Philips-Fontana.

In 1961, Mouskouri performed the soundtrack of a German documentary about Greece. This resulted in the German-language single &quot;Weiße Rosen aus Athen&quot; (&quot;White Roses from Athens&quot;). The song was originally adapted by Hadjidakis from a folk melody. It became a success, selling over a million copies in Germany. The song was later translated into several languages and it went on to become one of Mouskouri&#x27;s signature tunes.
==Family life==
Mouskouri has been married twice: first at age 25, to Yorgos (George) Petsilas, a guitarist in her backing band (the trio &quot;The Athenians&quot;) They had two children (Nicolas Petsilas in 1968 and Hélène (Lénou) Petsilas in 1970) but divorced when Mouskouri was 39. Not long after that, she started a relationship with her record producer André Chapelle; however, they did not marry then because she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to bring another man into the family&quot; and divorce was against her conservative upbringing. They eventually married on January 13, 2003, and live primarily in Switzerland.

==Life outside Greece==
In 1960, Mouskouri moved to Paris. She performed Luxembourg&#x27;s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963, &quot;À force de prier&quot;. Although the song achieved only eighth place in the contest, it achieved commercial success, and helped win her the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque in France. Mouskouri soon attracted the attention of French composer Michel Legrand, who composed two songs which became major French hits for her: &quot;Les Parapluies de Cherbourg&quot; (1964) and an arrangement of Katherine K. Davis&#x27;s &quot;Carol of the Drum&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Enfant au Tambour&quot; (1965).

In 1962, she met Quincy Jones, who persuaded her to travel to New York City to record an album of American jazz titled &quot;The Girl from Greece Sings&quot;. Following that she scored another hit in the United Kingdom with the song &quot;My Colouring Book&quot; (later included in her 1973 album &quot;Songs from her TV series&quot;). In 1965, she recorded her second English-language album to be released in the United States, entitled &quot;Nana Sings&quot;. American singer Harry Belafonte heard and liked the album. Belafonte brought Mouskouri on tour with him through 1966. They teamed up for a duo album entitled &quot;An Evening With Belafonte/Mouskouri&quot;. During this tour, Belafonte suggested that Mouskouri remove her signature black-rimmed glasses when on stage. She was so unhappy with the request that she wanted to quit the show after only two days. Finally, Belafonte relented and respected her wish to perform while wearing glasses.

On September 15, 1965, Mouskouri appeared for the first time on American television with Harry Belafonte on the &quot;Danny Kaye Show&quot;. While on the show Mouskouri performed &quot;Telalima&quot; followed by &quot;Σήκω χόρεψε κουκλί μου&quot; (&quot;Siko horepse koukli mou&quot;) accompanied by Harry Belafonte and Danny Kaye.
Mouskouri&#x27;s 1967 French album &quot;Le jour où la colombe&quot; raised her to super-stardom in France. This album featured many of her French songs, &quot;Au cœur de septembre&quot;, &quot;Adieu Angélina&quot;, &quot;Robe bleue, robe blanche&quot; and the French pop classic &quot;Le Temps des cerises&quot;. Mouskouri made her first appearance at Paris&#x27; legendary Olympia concert theatre the same year, singing French pop, Greek folk, and Hadjidakis numbers.

These successes across Europe and elsewhere impressed Yvonne Littlewood, the BBC producer who had first met Mouskouri at the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest in London. Following several successful guest appearances on British TV after her Eurovision performance, the BBC invited Mouskouri and her backing group, The Athenians, to start hosting a TV series called &quot;Presenting Nana Mouskouri&quot; from 1968 onwards. A typical episode of her series contained contemporary British, American and French pop and folk music, popular classical pieces, and the Greek songs which had originally made her famous. The shows also featured European and world music stars of the time as guests, making it one of the first BBC TV series to do so regularly. Despite the fact that stars from mainland Europe singing in languages other than English have tended to find it difficult to break into the British market, the series proved very popular with viewers of the new BBC-2 channel, and it ran until 1976. As well as performing songs known to British viewers, Mouskouri welcomed the television audience, chatted to her guest stars and gave spoken introductions to her French and Greek songs in fluent English. These introductions, along with a modest stage presence and her bespectacled appearance, made her a very distinctive star, as Yvonne Littlewood later explained:

: &quot;I suppose it was unusual to see a singer wearing glasses. She didn&#x27;t look like everyone else. She didn&#x27;t have blonde hair, and she was very distinctive in her appearance. […] You know, we should remember that, in those days, we didn&#x27;t have all the holiday programmes, so Greek music and anything Greek wasn’t as well known to the average public as it is now. […] She would give the gist [in English] of the subject of the song before she sang it, and that was really quite unique and quite charming.&quot;

Mouskouri&#x27;s international appeal encouraged the BBC to sell her programmes to television stations across the world, a fact which she acknowledged in a BBC interview in 2014:

: &quot;This series – I mean, for about 10 years I was doing every year the series on BBC-2… and they went everywhere… in Asia… of course in the Commonwealth… but even in South America… so that I think that I owe to the BBC a lot. And to Yvonne Littlewood, really.&quot;

Mouskouri also hosted her own shows for French and West German broadcasters during this period. At a time when TV programmes could attract huge audiences, her popularity as a multilingual television personality turned her into a truly international star. 

Although music series such as hers started to become less common on British TV as the 1970s wore on, the BBC continued to engage Mouskouri regularly for one-off television specials and guest appearances on other programmes until the mid-1980s, by which time she had been a regular contributor to British TV for more than 20 years. 

In 1969, Mouskouri released her first British LP, &quot;Over and over&quot;, which reached number 10 and spent a total of 102 weeks in the UK album charts. This began a series of albums for the UK market which, boosted by her TV appearances, sold extremely well during the early 1970s, including &quot;The exquisite Nana Mouskouri&quot; (1969), &quot;Turn on the sun&quot; (1970), &quot;A place in my heart&quot; (1971) and &quot;Presenting Nana Mouskouri - Songs from her TV series&quot; (1973), while concerts from two of her British tours were also recorded and released as LPs: &quot;British Concert&quot; (1972) and &quot;Live at the Albert Hall&quot; (1974).

During the 1970s, Mouskouri - always a prolific recording artist - recorded several hit records in German, such as &quot;Sieben schwarze Rosen&quot; (1975) and &quot;Lieder, die die Liebe schreibt&quot; (1978), and she continued to release a series of top-selling records in France, including &quot;Comme un soleil&quot; (1971), &quot;Une voix qui vient du cœur&quot; (1972), &quot;Vieilles chansons de France&quot; (1973), and &quot;Quand tu chantes&quot; (1976). Meanwhile, &quot;Passport,&quot; a compilation including her most popular songs in English, reached number 3 in the UK album charts in 1976 and won for her a gold disc.

In August 1974, while in Australia, Mouskouri was presented with a plaque representing the sale of twenty Gold Records.

As her fame began spreading outside her fan base in Europe, the United States, and the Commonwealth, Mouskouri was asked to record songs for the Japanese and Taiwanese markets. In 1976, a renowned Taiwanese author, Echo, heard her music and introduced it to one of her female radio DJ friends. Mouskouri&#x27;s records then became popular in Taiwan, especially among high school and college students, with one of her British albums, &quot;Nana&#x27;s book of songs&quot; (1974) becoming particularly popular.

==Middle years==
In 1979, Mouskouri released another English-language album named &quot;Roses and Sunshine&quot;. This album consisted largely of folk and country material, and included work from sources including Neil Young, Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan and John Denver. It was well received in Canada, and one of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Even Now&quot; (not the same song as the 1978 Barry Manilow hit), became a staple on beautiful music radio stations in the United States. She scored a worldwide hit in 1981 with &quot;Je chante avec toi Liberté&quot;, which was translated into several languages after its success in France. The momentum from this album also helped boost her following German album, &quot;Meine Lieder sind mein Leben&quot;. In 1984, Mouskouri returned to Greece and performed to a large audience at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus; her first performance in her homeland since 1962.

In 1985, Mouskouri recorded &quot;Only Love&quot;, the theme song to the American TV series &quot;Mistral&#x27;s Daughter&quot; – based upon the novel by Judith Krantz – which reached number 2 in the UK charts. The song was also a hit in its other versions: &quot;L&#x27;Amour en héritage&quot; (French), &quot;Come un&#x27;eredità&quot; (Italian), &quot;La dicha del amor&quot; (Spanish), and &quot;Aber die Liebe bleibt&quot; (German). The German version was also recorded with an alternate set of lyrics under the title &quot;Der wilde Wein&quot;; it was withdrawn in favour of &quot;Aber die Liebe bleibt&quot;.

That same year, Mouskouri made a play for the Spanish-language market with the hit single &quot;Con Toda el Alma&quot;. The song was a major success in Spain, Argentina and Chile.

Mouskouri released five albums in different languages in 1987, and the following year returned to her classical conservatory roots with the double LP &quot;The Classical Nana&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Nana Classique&quot;), which featured adaptations of classical songs and excerpts from opera. By the end of 1987, she had performed a series of concerts in Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand.

==Later years==
Mouskouri&#x27;s 1991 English album, &quot;Only Love: The Best of Nana Mouskouri&quot;, became her best-selling release in the United States. She spent much of the 1990s touring the globe. Among her early 1990s albums were spiritual music, &quot;Gospel&quot; (1990), the Spanish-language &quot;Nuestras Canciones&quot;, the multilingual, Mediterranean-themed &quot;Côté Sud, Côté Coeur&quot; (1992), &quot;Dix Mille Ans Encore&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love Again: Great Songs From the Movies&quot;. &quot;Falling in Love&quot; featured two duets with Harry Belafonte.

In 1993, Mouskouri recorded the album &quot;Hollywood&quot;. Produced by Michel Legrand it was a collection of famous songs from films, and served not only as a tribute to the world of cinema, but also as a personal reference to childhood memories of sitting with her father in his projection room in Crete.

She recorded several more albums in 1996 and 1997, including the Spanish &quot;Nana Latina&quot; (which featured duets with Julio Iglesias and Mercedes Sosa), the English-language &quot;Return to Love&quot;, and the French pop classics, &quot;Hommages&quot;. In 1997, she staged a high-profile &quot;Concert for Peace&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. This concert was later released as an album, and aired as a TV special on PBS in the United States.

On 30 May 2013, Mouskouri was awarded an honorary degree by McGill University, Canada.

==UNICEF and politics==
Mouskouri was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in October 1993. She took over from the previous ambassador, the recently deceased actress Audrey Hepburn. Mouskouri&#x27;s first U.N. mission took her to Bosnia to draw attention to the plight of children affected by the Bosnian war. She went on to give a series of fund-raising concerts in Sweden and Belgium.

She was a Member of the European Parliament for Greece through the centre-right New Democracy party from 1994 until 1999, when she resigned from her position as an MEP. Several reasons have been given for the resignation, one being her pacifism, and another being that she felt ill-equipped for the day-to-day work of a politician.

==21st century==

Mouskouri lives in Switzerland with Chapelle, and, until her final performance in 2008, performed hundreds of concerts every year throughout her career. In 2004, her French record company released a 34-CD box set of more than 600 of Mouskouri&#x27;s mostly French songs. In 2006, she made a guest appearance at that year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest which was held, for the first time ever, in her native Greece.

In the same year, she announced her plans to retire. From 2005 until 2008, she conducted a farewell concert tour of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South America, the United States, and Canada. On July 23 and 24, 2008, Mouskouri gave her two final &#x27;Farewell Concert&#x27; performances at the ancient Herodes Atticus Theatre, in Athens, Greece, before a packed stadium, including Greece&#x27;s Prime Minister and the mayor of Athens, plus the mayors of Berlin, Paris and Luxembourg, along with fans from around the world and thousands of her Athenian admirers.

In 2010, in response to the financial crisis in Greece, Mouskouri announced that she would forgo her pension to contribute to the country&#x27;s recovery. She commented: &quot;Everywhere I see stories about my country going bankrupt. And people are aggressive about it. It&#x27;s frightening. And it&#x27;s painful for me. Nobody wants their country to be treated badly. It&#x27;s frustrating and very sad.&quot;

In late 2011, Mouskouri released two newly recorded CDs, the first featuring songs of the Greek Islands, recorded with other Greek singers, and the second featuring duets with French contemporaries. In late November 2011, Mouskouri sang again at a single concert, with guests, in Berlin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of her hit single &quot;The White Rose of Athens&quot;. She then did a concert tour in Germany in 2012. At age 80, she embarked on a three-year Happy Birthday Tour; in 2018 she had booked a five-month Forever Young Tour through parts of Europe and North America.

In 2015, she was awarded with the Echo Music Prize for Outstanding achievements by the German music association Deutsche Phono-Akademie.

Despite her &#x27;farewell tour&#x27; and &#x27;final concert&#x27;, she continues to make occasional appearances on TV shows, especially in Germany, though increasingly using &#x27;le playback&#x27; (miming), which, unlike many other singers, she rarely used through most of her career; the most recent at time of writing was the 2023-12-2 German (ARD1) &#x27;Das Adventsfest der 100 000 Lichter&#x27; (advent celebration of 100,000 lights - coincidentally the show&#x27;s title partially reflecting one of her early [1965] German hits), in which she duetted one song and participated in the finale.

==In popular culture==
The British comedian Benny Hill impersonated Mouskouri on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;. Wearing a long dress, large glasses and long black hair, he talked and sang with a slow and quiet voice. He introduced a song with a long translation into English of all the events supposedly mentioned in the song; he then sang just a single line of &quot;Greek&quot;.

Andrea Martin played Mouskouri in a sketch, &#x27;The Nana Mouskouri Story&#x27;, during the 1981–1982 season of &quot;SCTV&quot; (later included in a DVD compilation).

In 1976, Ronnie Barker performed a song in drag as a parody of Mouskouri in &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; as Nana Moussaka. Mouskouri was also parodied in the first episode of the 1970s New Zealand political satire &quot;A Week Of It&quot;.

In 1991, British comedian Victoria Wood mentioned Mouskouri in her original song, &quot;The Reincarnation Song.&quot; The song was included in Wood&#x27;s television special of that year, &quot;Victoria Wood: Sold Out&quot;.

In the &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; episode &quot;O-Ed-Eleven&quot;, Eddy&#x27;s brother is shown to have a Nana Mouskouri poster in his old bedroom.

Karl Pilkington included Mouskouri as a clue in his contest &#x27;Rockbusters&#x27;, part of the radio show &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; on XFM. Broadcasting on December 31, 2005, the clue was &quot;Me granny&#x27;s taking a penalty. She better get the ball in the back of the net,&quot; initials (NM) = Nana Mouskouri (nanna must score &#x27;ere). Gervais described this clue as &quot;one of his best clues ever.&quot;

In 2015, Liina Vahtrik parodied her song &quot;Only Love&quot; on the Estonian version of &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot;.

==Chart records and certifications ==
United Kingdom

In the UK, Mouskouri performed quite successfully. Her 1976 release titled &quot;Passport&quot; was certified Gold while her 1977 album &quot;The Magic of Nana Mouskouri&quot; also attained Gold status a year after it was released. She also had two other silver certified albums, &quot;Alone&quot; (1986) and &quot;At Her Very Best&quot; (2001).

Others

In 2003, Arion Greek Music Awards honored Mouskouri with a Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2015, Echo Awards honored Mouskouri with a Lifetime Achievement Award for her undeniable impact and legacy.

In 1992, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine included Mouskouri on their list of &quot;7 chart-toppers you won&#x27;t see on MTV&quot; and stated that Mouskouri sells two million records each year worldwide and has released about 800 albums in seven different languages.

In 1996, Platinum Europe Awards handed Mouskouri a special award saying &quot;Europe is a great musical culture&quot;. She also received a Golden Disc Award for &quot;Weisse Rosen Aus Athen&quot; and became the first Philip artist to reach one million sales.

The single &quot;White Roses from Athens” was released in 1961, which stayed at number 1 on the charts for 39 weeks and sold more than 1.5 million copies within six months.

<text>The Council of Epaone or Synod of Epaone was held in September 517 at Epaone (or Epao, near the present Anneyron) in the Burgundian Kingdom.

It was one of three national councils of bishops held around that time in former Roman Gaul: the council of Agde was held in 506 in the Visigothic Kingdom in the south and the council of Orléans in 511 for the Kingdom of the Franks. The synod enacted the first legislation against wooden altars, forbidding the building of any but stone altars. It also witnessed to the rise of the practice of mitigation of canonical penance in view of the changing times and social conditions of Christians.

== Attendees ==
* St. Viventiolus (515-523), who presided
* St. Avitus, also presiding.
* St. Constantinus, bishop of Gap.
* Catulinus, bishop of Embrun.
* Laymen were also present and had a chance to question the morality of the local clergymen.

== Edicts passed ==
* Canon 12: forbade bishops from alienating ecclesiastical property without the permission of their metropolitan.
* Canon 15: Attendance at Jewish banquets prohibited.
* Canon 16: allowed baptized heretics to be admitted to the Church by a rite of unction (&quot;Presbyteros, . . . si conversionem subitam petant, chrismate subvenire permittimus&quot;). This was the practice also in the East, but in Rome and Italy admission was by laying on of hands.
* Canon 26: forbade the consecration of any but stone Altars.
* Clergy forbidden to hunt. 
* Completely abrogated in the entire Kingdom the consecration of widows who are named Deaconesses.
* Canon 29 reduced to two years the penance that apostates were to undergo on their return to the Church, but obliged them to fast one day in three during those two years, to come to church and take their place at the penitents&#x27; door, and to leave with the catechumens. Any who objected to the new arrangement were to observe the much longer ancient penance.

* &quot;EPAO, SYNOD OF: A synod held in Sept., 517, at Epao or Epaone, a village to the south of Vienne, near the present Anneyron, at that time part of the kingdom of Burgundy, where a year earlier the Arian king Gundobad had been succeeded by his orthodox son Sigismund. It was attended by twenty-four bishops from all parts of the kingdom, on the invitation of Avitua of Vienne (q.v.). Laymen seem to have been present, after their participation had been declared lawful; canon axiv. permitted them to bring charges against any clergy who were justly accused of immorality. The forty canons passed at this meeting should be considered in connection with those of the synods of Agile (506) and Orleans (511; qq.v.). They were intended to do for the Burgundian kingdom what these had done for the Visigothic or Frankish — though the speedy dissolution of the former made their effect slight. Several of them, however, were included in a later (Spanish) collection of the canons of Agile (though with some modifications in the direction of less severity), and thus continued to have an influence on subsequent practise. The spirit of Avitus breathes through them all. An important section deals with the inalienability of ecclesiastical property; a more vigorous repression of Arianism is demanded, though the return of individuals to the Church is made easy. It appears that priests and deacons were married, and that the episcopal oversight embraced the monasteries. The enforcement of the rights of bishops corresponds to the treatment of the metropolitan power. The number of forbidden degrees for marriage is increased, in har mony with older legislation, apparently with an eye to the case of a royal official who had married his deceased wife&#x27;s sister; this led to an attempt on the king&#x27;s part to discipline the bishops, and to a firm pronouncement on their part at the first Synod of Lyons (before 523), at which eleven of the members of the Synod of Epao were present.&quot;

<text>The Council of Vaison refers to two separate synods consisting of officials and theologians of the Catholic Church which were held in or near to the Avignon commune of Vaison, France. The first was held in 442 and the second in 529.

==First meeting==
During the second meeting, 10 canons were decreed, mainly dealing with solidifying the power in which the bishops held, such as that priests should not have fellowship with enemies of the aforesaid.

==Second meeting==
The third and final council enacted only 5 laws, which mainly related to Mass, including a requirement of repetition of the Kyrie (Lord have mercy) and another which called for regular prayers for the Bishop of Rome.

The meeting was presided over by Caesarius of Arles.

<doc id="1196080" wikidata="Q2164003" url="?curid=1196080" title="Spawning (video games)">
<text>In video games, spawning is the live creation of a character, item or NPC. Respawning is the recreation of an entity after its death or destruction, perhaps after losing one of its lives. Despawning is the deletion of an entity from the game world.

All player characters typically spawn at the start of a round, whereas some objects or mobs may spawn after the occurrence of a particular event or delay. When a player character respawns, they generally do so in an earlier point of the level and get some kind of penalty.

The term was coined by id Software within the context of its game, &quot;Doom&quot;.

==Spawn points==
&quot;Spawn points&quot; are areas in a level where players spawn. In levels designed for team play, these points are usually grouped so that each team spawns in their own tight area of the level. Spawn points are typically reserved for one team at any time and often have the ability to change hands to the other team. Some games even allow spawn points to be created by players; using a beacon for example in &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot;. &quot;Odd&quot; spawn points cause the player to be spawned as if actively entering the game world, rather than merely appearing there.

Regarding player-created spawn points, the game &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot; allows players utilizing the Strogg Technician class (Strogg team version of GDF Medic class) to create &quot;spawn hosts&quot; out of the bodies of fallen GDF enemies. Any player on the Strogg team can use any unused spawn host and the player – upon death – can use it to spawn closer to the objective or in a tactical location, being effective tools for defending a location or advancing the front line. The spawn host disappears after the Strogg player respawns at its location, so the spawn host can only be used once. Conversely, players utilizing the GDF Medic class can disable and remove Strogg player-created spawn hosts by zapping them with their defibrillator pads.

Spawn camping is a practice where a player waits near precise spawn points to kill enemies as they spawn. This is usually considered to be poor sportsmanship and some players even perceive it to be exploitative of the game itself. Most team-based games have some kind of protection against spawn camping, such as a one-way door that only allows players to &quot;leave&quot; the spawn area, permanent AI defences or perhaps a timer which kills enemies if they spend too long around the spawn area. Games with capturable spawn points will often leave some spawn points without this sort of camping protection. Spawn points for game objects are often abused in a similar fashion in game types such as role-playing games.

==Enemy respawning==
In some games, enemies may be respawned (or, equivalently, new ones spawned) to keep players on their toes and create tension, or force players to move on, making it too costly (in resources) and/or too dangerous to stay in one place for too long. Enemies may visibly spawn or, in games that emphasize realism, spawn outside the player&#x27;s line of sight and move towards the player. Early games including monster respawning are &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; and its sequel &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;. The enemies in these games had the ability to spawn from their teammates.

In MMORPGs, it is typical for monsters or mobs of monsters to continually respawn to allow all players a chance to fight. Some of these games implement instances, which create a temporary copy of the game world and its characters, reserved for a subset of players; this allows each subset the chance to experience that part of the game without any interference from uninvited guests.

==Player-requested entities==
In some games a player who has access to debugging or administrative tools can spawn entities or pickups with said tools.

<text>Salonius of Embrun and Sagittarius of Gap were two bishops who had been condemned at the Council of Lyon (). They were detained in Saint-Marcel-lès-Chalon (near Chalon, eastern Gaul). They succeeded, however, in persuading Guntram, King of Burgundy, that they had been condemned unjustly, and appealed to the pope. Influenced by the king&#x27;s letters, Pope John III decided that they must be restored to their sees.

<text>The side-chain theory (German, Seitenkettentheorie) is a theory proposed by Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915) to explain the immune response in living cells. Ehrlich theorized from very early in his career that chemical structure could be used to explain why the immune response occurred in reaction to infection. He believed that toxins and antitoxins were chemical substances at a time when very little was known about their nature. The theory explains the interaction of antibodies and antigens in the blood, and how antibodies are produced.

==History==

In 1891, Paul Ehrlich joined the newly established Robert Koch Institute in Berlin upon the invitation of Robert Koch himself. By 1896 a new branch, the Institute for Serum Research and Testing (Institut für Serumforschung und Serumprüfung), was established in Frankfurt with Ehrlich as its founding director. He worked on antitoxins for diphtheria and their binding to antibodies in the blood. He hypothesised that antibodies bind to antigens through special chemical structures that he called &quot;side chains&quot; (which he later named &quot;receptors&quot;). Borrowing a concept used by Emil Fischer in 1894 to explain the interaction between an enzyme and its substrate, Ehrlich proposed that binding of the receptor to an infectious agent was like the fit between a lock and key. He published the first part of his side-chain theory in 1897, and its full form in 1900 in a lecture he delivered to the Royal Society in London.

==Postulate==

Ehrlich&#x27;s theory can be summarised with the following tenets:
# Antibodies are produced by white blood cells normally and they act as side chains (receptors) on the cell membrane.
# Antibody specificity exists for specific interaction with a given antigen.
# Antigen–antibody interaction occurs by precise binding through the side chains.

==Concept==
Ehrlich supposed that living cells have side chains in the same way dyes have side chains which are related to their coloring properties. These side chains can link with a particular toxin (or any antigen), just as Emil Fischer said enzymes must bind to their receptors &quot;as lock and key.&quot;

Ehrlich theorised that a cell under threat grew additional side chains to bind the toxin, and that these additional side chains broke off to become the antibodies that are circulated through the body. According to this theory, the surface of white blood cells is covered with many side chains that form chemical links with the antigens. For any given antigen, at least one of these side chains would bind, stimulating the cell to produce more of the same type, which would then be liberated into the blood stream as antibodies. According to Ehrlich, an antibody could be considered an irregularly shaped, microscopic, three-dimensional label that would bind to a specific antigen but not to the other cells of the organism. It was these antibodies that Ehrlich first described as &quot;magic bullets&quot;, agents that specifically target toxins or pathogens without harming the body.

Ehrlich suggested that interaction between an infectious agent and a cell-bound receptor would induce the cell to produce and release more receptors with the same specificity. According to Ehrlich’s theory, the specificity of the receptor was determined before its exposure to antigen, and the antigen selected the appropriate receptor. Ultimately all aspects of Ehrlich&#x27;s theory would be proven correct with the minor exception that the &quot;receptor&quot; exists as both a soluble antibody molecule and as a cell-bound receptor; it is the soluble form that is secreted rather than the bound form released.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway403 (pronounced &quot;four-oh-three&quot;), or simply Highway403, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that travels between Woodstock and Mississauga, branching off from and reuniting with Highway 401 at both ends and travelling south of it through Hamilton (where it is also known as the Chedoke Expressway) and Mississauga. It is concurrent with the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) for from Burlington to Oakville. The Highway403 designation was first applied in 1963 to a short stub of freeway branching off the QEW at Burlington, and the entire route was completed on August15, 1997, when the section from Brantford to the then-still independent Town of Ancaster was opened to traffic. The section of Highway403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April27, 2016, in honour of Alexander Graham Bell.

The majority of Highway403 is surrounded by suburban land use, except west of Hamilton, where it passes through agricultural land; Brantford is the only urban area through this section. In Hamilton, Highway403 descends the Niagara Escarpment, then wraps around the northern side of Hamilton Harbour to encounter the QEW. From there, co-signed with the QEW, it travels straight through Burlington and Oakville, departing from the QEW to the north at the Mississauga–Oakville boundary. The freeway then crosses through the centre of Mississauga in an east–west direction, serving its city centre. Turning north, Highway403 splits up into a collector-express system, with the express lanes defaulting to Highway401 east of that interchange, while the collector lanes thereafter continues north as Highway 410 to Brampton.

== Route description ==

=== Woodstock to Burlington ===
Highway403 begins at a junction with Highway401 on the outskirts of Woodstock. The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway401, whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway401.
It travels along the back lot lines of the second concession south of former Highway2.
This first section of the highway is also the least travelled portion, with approximately 20,900vehicles using it on an average day in 2016.
The highway passes beneath Oxford County Road 55 (formerly Highway53) and curves southeast. After crossing into the third concession, it curves back to the east. The highway travels straight for several kilometres, meeting with the southern leg of Highway 24, which travels south to Simcoe.

The highway crosses the Grand River to the south of Paris, then passes over former Highway2 as it enters Brantford. As it passes through Brantford, the highway angles southeast and passes beneath the northern leg of Highway24 and then the Wayne Gretzky Parkway. The route exits the small city to the east and curves northeast shortly thereafter. It travels between Jerseyville Road and former Highway2 to Ancaster, jogging to avoid cutting through Dunmark Lake. As the freeway enters Ancaster, it once again crosses former Highway2 and dips through the southern side of the town. Since July 12, 2024, the speed limit on the stretch between the west end of the highway and Brantford and the stretch between Brantford and Hamilton is .
East of Ancaster, the freeway passes through a short greenbelt, with Hamilton Golf and Country Club lying to the north. A divided segment of Highway 6 meets the freeway and continues concurrently with it through Hamilton; to the south, Highway6 travels to Hamilton International Airport, Caledonia, and Jarvis at Highway 3. Continuing east, Highway403 and Highway6 curve north into Hamilton and meet the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway before abruptly turning to the east and descending the Niagara Escarpment. Scenic views of Hamilton, its harbour, port and Lower Princess Falls are along this steep descent. At the bottom of the escarpment the highway travels through a narrow, heavily developed corridor alongside former Highway 8. It passes beneath multiple bridges in a depressed trench, eventually curving north at a sharp corner and passing beneath more bridges. This section features a reduced speed limit of as opposed to . The highway returns to ground level alongside the Chedoke Creek, a now-channelized river from which the freeway may take its name.

As the freeway continues north, it crosses an isthmus between Hamilton Harbour and Cootes Paradise alongside several roads which it has served to replace. It circles around the northern shore of Hamilton Harbour and returns to an eastward orientation. The concurrency with Highway6 ends at an interchange where Highway403 continues east and Highway6 departs north towards Guelph. The freeway continues straight for several kilometres, passing by the Burlington Transmission Station, until it approaches the Freeman Interchange where the opposing carriageways split apart to accommodate the left-hand exit/entry of the flyover ramps marking the western terminus of Highway 407, then it merges with Queen Elizabeth Way.

=== Burlington to Mississauga ===
Highway403 travels concurrently with the QEW for between the Freeman Interchange and Oakville, a straight section surrounded almost entirely by commercial units and warehouses.
At the Ford Assembly Plant near the Halton–Peel regional boundary, Highway403 branches off from the QEW as it crosses Ford Drive (Halton Regional Road 13), with the eastbound lanes diving under the QEW and Upper Middle Road before reuniting with the westbound carriageway. After running north–south for along the western edge of Mississauga, Highway403 meets with Highway 407 again at a combination interchange where the two freeways curve 90 degrees to avoid crossing each other. Approaching this junction Highway403 westbound traffic defaults onto Highway407 so motorists have to continue on Highway403 via a semi-directional flyover that arcs from the west to the south. This north–south segment of Highway403 was originally planned as a temporary routing to be bypassed by a new direct Oakville-Burlington link; but in 1995 this routing became permanently part of Highway403 when the proposed link instead became part of Highway407.

Highway407 continues to the north and west, while Highway403 turns east to follow alongside a hydro corridor through the centre of Mississauga. A portion of the Mississauga Transitway express bus service utilizes the freeway&#x27;s right shoulders between Erin Mills Parkway and Mavis Road. Between Highway407 and Highway401, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes are present in the left shoulder lanes for vehicles with at least one passenger.
Sandwiched between residential subdivisions on both sides, the freeway soon thereafter crosses the Credit River. On the other side of the river, between the interchanges with Mavis Road and Hurontario Street (formerly Highway 10), Highway403 skirts to the north of downtown Mississauga, as well as the Square One Shopping Centre.

After a split with Eastgate Parkway where exiting drivers can access Eglinton Avenue or Cawthra Road at a signalized intersection, Highway403 abruptly curves to the north. As the curve straightens and approaches the Parlo interchange with Eglinton Avenue, Cawthra Road&#x27;s northbound lane converges with the onramps from Eglinton to form the eastbound collector lanes, soon joined by the eastbound express-to-collector transfer that also marks the start of another HOV lane. For the westbound collector-express system of Highway403, after an offramp to Eglinton Avenue there is collector-to-express transfer; thereafter the collector lanes including the onramps from Eglinton split off and continues south as Cawthra Road, with a signalized intersection for Eastgate Parkway or Highway403 westbound. The portion of the highway between Hurontario Street and Eglinton Avenue is the busiest along the route, with approximately 180,000vehicles travelling it on an average day in 2016.

After crossing Matheson Boulevard, the freeway&#x27;s central HOV lanes terminate and merge with the express lanes. The freeway then approaches a sprawling interchange, with the express lanes curving east and defaulting to Highway401&#x27;s express lanes east of that junction, while the collector lanes (including its HOV lane) pass under several sets of flyovers and thereafter continues north as Highway 410 to Brampton. The freeway&#x27;s collector lanes also have connecting ramps to both directions of Highway401&#x27;s collector lanes.
== History ==

Though one of the first divided highways conceived for Ontario, Highway403 is one of the most recently completed freeways in the province; the multiple segments of the route did not become continuous until 2002. Planning for the route was underway by 1958, as a portion of QEW was realigned from its original alignment of Middle Road to the &quot;Freeman Diversion&quot; which also included three-legged junction for the future Highway403. Sections of Highway403 through Hamilton opened between December 1963 and September 1969, with that stretch known as the &quot;Chedoke Expressway&quot;. An isolated section known as the Brantford Bypass was opened in October 1966, and would remain unconnected to other freeways for over 20years. Plans for a third segment through Mississauga (originally known as the Hamilton Expressway) were contemplated throughout the 1960s, but were not finalized until late 1977, after which construction began. Portions opened at both ends in 1980 and 1981, while the central gap, crossing the Credit River, was completed in December 1982.

Construction to bridge the gaps in Highway403 between Ancaster and Woodstock was carried out over three major phases. The first phase was a short extension of the Brantford Bypass beginning in 1975, however motorists would have to continue on Highway2/53 to reach Highway401. Later, work began to connect that extension with Highway401 near Woodstock, which opened in 1988. An existing portion of Highway2 served as the connector between the Woodstock-Brantford and Ancaster-Hamilton segments, until the last phase between Ancaster and Brantford finally opened in 1997.
The final discontinuity, between Burlington and Oakville, was signed as a concurrency with the QEW in 2002. Originally, Highway403 was to be extended westward from Oakville to connect directly with the Burlington-Brantford segment, bypassing the north–south routing of Highway403 along the Mississauga-Oakville boundary that would then be re-designated as part of the proposed Highway407. Budget shortfalls in 1995 resulted in a change of plans, so Highway403 retained the existing north–south segment in Oakville, while the vacant corridor previously intended for Highway403 from Oakville to Burlington has since been occupied by the westmost extension of Highway407 ETR that opened in 2001. 

The stretch of Highway403 between Woodstock and Burlington, whose separate segments were previously known as the &quot;Brantford Bypass&quot; and &quot;Chedoke Expressway&quot;, was formally dedicated as the &quot;Alexander Graham Bell Parkway&quot; on April27, 2016, in honour of Alexander Graham Bell. Some sources like Google Maps have erroneously referred to the entirety of Highway403 as the &quot;Chedoke Expressway&quot;. 

=== Predecessors ===

The corridor that connects London and Hamilton has always been considered important to Ontario. In late October 1793, Captain Smith and 100 Queen&#x27;s Rangers returned from carving The Governor&#x27;s Road (Dundas Street) through the thick forests between Dundas and the present location of Paris. John Graves Simcoe was tasked with defending Upper Canada from the United States following the American Revolution and with opening the virgin territory to settlement. After establishing a &quot;temporary&quot; capital at York, Simcoe ordered an inland route constructed between Cootes Paradise at the tip of Lake Ontario and his proposed capital of London. By the spring of 1794, the road was extended as far as La Tranche, now the Thames River. Today, most of this route forms part of former Highway 2 and former Highway 5.

The paving of the divided four-lane Middle Road, with gentle curves, a grass median, and grade-separated interchanges, would set the stage for the freeway concept. It was the first intercity freeway in North America when it opened in June 1939.
Thomas McQuesten, the new minister of the Department of Highways and the man most responsible for the Middle Road, decided to apply the concept to sections of Highway2 plagued with congestion. A portion east of Woodstock was rebuilt in this fashion, but World War II would put an end to McQuesten&#x27;s ambitions, at least temporarily.

=== Initial construction ===

The end of the Korean War in 1953 heralded the resumption of freeway construction in Ontario; the advances in machinery more than made up for lost time.
The construction of Highway401 across the province took first priority. However, the opening of the section of Highway 401 from Highway4 near London to Highway2 east of Woodstock on May31, 1957 would complete part of the route required between London and Hamilton.

By 1958, planning on the &quot;Chedoke Expressway&quot;, or Controlled Access Highway403, was well underway,
though plans for a four-lane freeway between Woodstock and Hamilton existed as early as 1954.
The opening of the &quot;Freeman Diversion&quot; alignment of the QEW in August 1958 provided a connection point for the future Chedoke Expressway,
and construction began the same day that the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway opened: October31, 1958.
Highway403 between Longwood Road (Highway2) and the QEW was opened to traffic on December1, 1963 at a length of . Work was already underway on the next section of the route that would extend it to Aberdeen Avenue.
That section opened on July9, 1965, extending the freeway by .

Meanwhile, to the west, work had begun on a bypass of Brantford. The new freeway passed north of the city between Paris Road in the west and the junction of Highway2 and Highway 53 in the east, a distance of ; it opened October31, 1966.
A portion of the &quot;Brantford Bypass&quot; was itself bypassed in 1997 when the final section of Highway403 was completed and is known as Garden Avenue.
However, the Brantford Bypass would remain an isolated section of Highway403 for over 20years.

In Hamilton, work was underway on an extension of the &quot;Chedoke Expressway&quot; to Mohawk Road, crossing the Niagara Escarpment. This tedious project, which required extensive rock blasting, was soon accompanied by construction from Mohawk Road to Highway2 near Ancaster. Both projects were completed together and originally scheduled to be opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August22, 1969.
However, local residents complained the new section lacked any barriers preventing children from wandering onto the highway, postponing the ceremony until August27 as temporary snow fencing was erected. This proved inadequate, and protests grew more vocal over the following week. Several petitions were presented to Deputy Highway Minister H. Howden on August26, and the ceremonies were cancelled.
Over the following week, Minister of Highways George Gomme met with residents and reached a compromise whereby a 24-hour patrol was established to watch for children until a proper fence could be constructed. The route was opened on September3, without any ceremony.
This completed the Hamilton section of Highway403.

=== Mississauga ===

Planning for the segment of Highway403 through Mississauga dates to the late 1950s when the &quot;Hamilton Expressway&quot; appeared on the Metropolitan Toronto&#x27;s regional transportation plan. It was to be a continuation of the Richview Expressway, which was ultimately never built, continuing from Toronto to Hamilton. The plan featured the expressway&#x27;s eastern terminus at the Highway401 and Highway427 interchange. As Toronto&#x27;s anti-expressway movement gained momentum, provincial plans shifted the &quot;Hamilton Expressway&quot; to the west near Etobicoke Creek. In 1962, the right-of-way alongside the hydro corridor between Burlington and Etobicoke Creek was protected after traffic studies indicated the need for a future freeway.
On May25, 1965, the Department of Highways unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated Highway403 north from Burlington and then parallel with the QEW to Highway401 near Highway27.

By the time construction was actually underway, plans had been completely modified to connect the overburdened QEW at Oakville with Highway401 at the new Highway410 interchange.
This interchange was a better connection point for Highway403, but would also require the widening of Highway401 from six lanes to twelve. Plans were submitted and approved in December 1977 by Mississauga city council, and construction began.

The new freeway opened in sections during the early 1980s. The first section between Cawthra Road and Highway401 was opened August18, 1980.
This was followed by a short section from Highway 5 (Dundas Street) south to the QEW at Ford Drive, which opened in mid-1981, with a further extension to Erin Mills Parkway opening on November17th of that year.
The final section to be opened took the longest to complete, involving construction of two bridges over the Credit River valley; it opened on December2, 1982. The cost of the entire Mississauga segment was $87 million. As opened the Mississauga segment was six lanes wide between Cawthra Road and Winston Churchill Boulevard, and thereafter four lanes wide to the QEW in Oakville, with a grass media and overhead signage but no illumination except at interchanges. The existing QEW between Burlington and Oakville serves as the freeway link between the two segments of Highway403.

Around the same period, the Ministry of Transportation began to study upgrading Highway401 to a collector–express system between Renforth Drive and Highway403, and along Highway403 between Highway401 and Highway10 (Hurontario Street).
This took place between late 1982 and the summer of 1985; the existing outermost ramps from Highway403 to Highway401 eastbound were re-designated to serve collector traffic, as a pair of flyover ramps were added inside the interchange to serve motorists in the express lanes. After these inner flyover ramps were completed, then the outermost ramp from Highway401 westbound to Highway403 westbound was closed so a new flyover could be inserted to cross the future Highway401 express lanes. 

The right-of-way originally intended for Highway403 between Cawthra Road and Etobicoke Creek was eventually used for a controlled-access arterial extension called Eastgate Parkway, which was planned beginning in 1982.
The extension was built between 1988 and 1994, incorporating a portion of Fieldgate Drive at the eastern end.
The first section, between Cawthra Road and Dixie Road, opened in early 1991.
This was followed several years later by the section from Dixie Road to Eglinton Avenue that opened in late 1994.

In 1990 construction was underway on the planned but not-yet-built parts of the Highway401-403-410 interchange, alongside the widening of Highway410 into a full freeway, and the further expansion of Highway 401&#x27;s collector-express system. At the time traffic from both freeways was forced onto eastbound Highway401. Two semi-directional flyover ramps were built, for the Highway 401 eastbound to Highway 410 northbound movement, and the Highway 410 southbound to Highway 401 eastbound movement, the latter which replaced an existing loop ramp. The removal of that loop ramp, as well as completion of the new flyovers in the interchange, would free up space for connections between Highway 403 and Highway 410 whose construction started in December 1991.
The link opened on November2, 1992 at a cost of $7.3 million.

==== Controversy ====
Though some officials considered Highway403 to be a perfect example of a freeway construction process, it was not built without its share of controversy. Portions of the freeway through Mississauga were built alongside established communities, leading to angry homeowners&#x27; associations pressuring the province for noise mitigation measures and compensation.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Mississauga section of Highway403 was the site of more than two dozen fatal accidents over a five-year period, one of the highest rates in North America at the time, despite being up to modern road standards. This led Peel Regional Police and the media to nickname it the &quot;Death Highway.&quot;
In particular, the stretch from Mavis Road to Erin Mills Parkway has been the site of numerous accidents. In this section, Highway403 features a downward slope as motorists head eastbound towards the Mavis Road interchange; drivers complain of having to slam on the brakes when traffic comes to a standstill, leading to rear-end collisions. There is also glare from the sun that causes vision problems throughout the day.

=== Connecting Brantford Bypass to Woodstock and Ancaster ===

In 1975, construction began on a westward extension of the Brantford Bypass, from Highway2 (Paris Road) to Rest Acres Road, which would become Highway24. This work consisted of the twin bridges over the Grand River and an interchange at Rest Acres Road. The Canadian National Railway underpass west of Highway2 was built by the railway.
By the beginning of 1978, this work was completed.
Work resumed west of Highway24 in early 1982 to connect with Highway401 near Woodstock to relieve the high traffic volumes along Highway2.
This included interchanges at Brant County Road25 and Highway53.
A section from Highway24 to County Road25 was opened in November 1984,
followed by the section west of there to Highway53 one year later.
Construction of the gap between Highway53 and Highway401 began in late 1985,
followed by the overpass crossing Highway401 for the westbound lanes, which began in 1987 with the westbound carriageway of Highway401 temporarily diverted to speed up construction of the cast-in-place post-tensioned flyover. 
Transportation minister Ed Fulton ceremoniously opened the new freeway connection on September26, 1988, completing the Woodstock to Brantford link.

Highway403 still had one remaining discontinuity, between Brantford and Ancaster where traffic was defaulted onto Colborne Street E (Highway2 and Highway53), a four-lane road with numerous private driveways and at-grade intersections. On March24, 1987, Chris Ward, MPP for Wentworth North announced that construction of the missing link between Brantford and Ancaster would begin in 1989.
Construction began in mid-1990. It included interchanges at Garden Avenue, Highway52 and Highway2.
A continuous construction program was carried out over the next seven years, with the link opening on August15, 1997.
With the completion of Highway403, Highway2 and Highway53 were subsequently downloaded to the local municipalities.

=== Recent construction ===
With the expanded capacity of the Burlington Skyway, and the unanticipated traffic volumes on Highway 403, the Freeman Interchange was now faced with a capacity problem. To resolve this, the renamed Ministry of Transportation began planning for the missing link of Highway 403 between Burlington and Mississauga that would run parallel to the QEW;
this right-of-way would be sold to the 407 ETR consortium in 1995 and built as part of that route.
Work began in August 1991 to reconfigure the directional T interchange to modern standards which included realigning the QEW carriageways as mainline traffic, and adding a fourth leg for the future Burlington-Mississauga link, although this necessitated replacing the directional ramp with a lower-capacity loop ramp for the movement from Toronto-bound QEW to the Brantford-bound Highway 403 (as some traffic was expected to be diverted away from the Burlington Skyway to the under-construction Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway and planned Red Creek Expressway). The reconfigured Freeman Interchange was partially opened on October 23, 1993 to serve the existing QEW and Highway 403 segments; the first sod for what would open as Highway 407 was turned that day. The completed ramps (the first to be built were cast-in-place post-tensioned bridges to cross Highway 403 westbound, followed in 2000 by precast girder bridges to pass over the North Service Road) connecting to the future Burlington-Mississauga freeway sat unused until that segment finally opened on July 30, 2001, as part of Highway 407 ETR.

The Hamilton-Brantford and Mississauga sections of Highway403 were eventually planned to be linked up via an east–west extension that would run parallel to the QEW, as the current north–south routing of Highway403 along the Mississauga-Oakville boundary to end at the QEW was intended to be temporary and eventually assumed by the proposed Highway407. When originally opened in 1981, the Highway403 westbound carriageway initially followed a ninety degree turn from west to south near Ninth Line, however in 1989 this was replaced by the first phase of a cloverstack interchange between Highway403 and Highway407, while the Highway403 westbound carriageway was shifted to a semi-directional flyover. The northern leg (to Highway401 just west of Mississauga) and western leg of that junction would be completed later; the partially-completed interchange included a temporary east–west connector (known internally by MTO as Highway 7197) to Trafalgar Road (Halton Regional Road3). 
However, the Bob Rae government altered these plans in 1995 due to budgetary constraints.
It was also announced the Mississauga section of Highway403 would be renumbered as Highway410,
although this was not done. Instead, Highway403 was signed concurrently along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002, remedying the discontinuity.
On September 4, 1998, Highway407 opened between Highway401 and Highway403. By the middle of 2001 access was added to the Burlington–Oakville segment of Highway407, previously intended to be part of Highway403, which incorporated the existing Highway 7197 which was redesignated as the ramp from Highway407 eastbound to Highway403 eastbound. 

In early 2001, high-mast lighting was added to the unlit Mississauga section between Highway407 and Eastgate Parkway. The lighting masts are placed between the westbound carriageway and hydro corridor, rather than in the median like most other provincial freeways. In 2003, the right shoulders between Erin Mills Parkway and Mavis Road were widened for GO Transit and Mississauga Transit to run express bus service.
These projects preceded the widening of Highway403 between Highway407 and Highway401/410, through which a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane was added in each direction; the project started on September 29, 2003 and was completed and opened on December13, 2005.
The HOV lanes and the dividing Ontario Tall Wall concrete barrier were constructed using the existing right-of-way provided by the grass median. Metrolinx began construction of the Mississauga Transitway West between Winston Churchill Boulevard and Erin Mills Parkway in October 2013, including realignment of hydro towers and new bus-only lanes crossing the existing ramps on the north side of Highway403&#x27;s interchange with Winston Churchill Boulevard, which was completed on December 31, 2016.

Land was reserved at the Highway401/403/410 junction for a loop ramp from Highway403 eastbound to Highway401 westbound, and a directional ramp for the opposite movement, however as a prerequisite Highway401 first had to be widened west of this interchange; previously Highway401&#x27;s collector-express system had terminated. The existing overpasses for the Highway403 to Highway410 link have sufficient right-of-way to accommodate the addition of a new HOV lane to the Highway403 eastbound collectors that would tie into the expanded Highway410 (itself being widened to include HOV lanes), as well as the approach to the loop ramp to Highway401 westbound. Construction commenced on these ramps by 2017.
The construction was completed in November 2018, making that interchange full access in all directions.

Highway403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April27, 2016. At the Desjardins Canal in Hamilton, starting in May 2022 the existing bridge for the eastbound lanes was replaced by a new single span pre-stressed NU girder structure bridge, while for the westbound lanes the 3 span 18 steel girder westbound structure was rehabilitated.

Improvements were made to the bottlenecked Highway 403/QEW/Ford Drive interchange in Oakville. Since 2017, traffic using the existing loop ramp in the NE corner to access Highway 403/QEW was directed onto a new overpass instead of sharing the existing overpass with westbound Highway 403 traffic. The existing bridges carrying QEW traffic across Ford Drive and the eastbound ramp to Highway 403 were demolished and replaced by new wider structures which can accommodate future HOV lanes and high-mast lighting. At the present Highway 403 only connects to the QEW west of the interchange, but a new set of flyover ramps are being proposed from Highway 403 to the QEW east of that junction using the existing right-of-way which would allow for a direct freeway connection from Milton to south Mississauga.

The 2017 initial design of the Hurontario LRT line had it occupying the centre median of Hurontario Street including the existing bridge crossing Highway403. At the southern approach to the bridge, there would be a junction for an LRT branch to the Mississauga City Centre, and the junction would have crossed the southbound traffic lanes of Hurontario Street and a Highway403 exit ramp at grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2019/04/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However studies showed that this initial LRT route would seriously impact vehicular traffic at the Highway403-Hurontario interchange. A revised 2021 route proposes that the LRT cross Highway403 on its own elevated guideway to the west of Hurontario Street overpass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2021/01/28&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are preliminary proposals for adding HOV lanes to Highway403 within Burlington, alongside a proposal to modify the Freeman Interchange.

<text>The Gippsland line is a regional passenger rail service operated by V/Line in Victoria, Australia. It serves 23 stations towards its terminus in the regional city of Bairnsdale, however most services terminate at Traralgon. 

==History==

Although the Gippsland line was extended to Orbost in 1916, passenger services along the line extended only as far as Bairnsdale beginning in the 1930s. In 1954 the line beyond Dandenong was electrified as far as Traralgon, with services from this time provided by the L class electric locomotives.

In 1975 suburban services were extended from Dandenong to Pakenham, on what is known as the Pakenham line. By the 1980s, the motive power of trains reverted to diesel locomotives, with electrification cut back to Warragul in 1987, and to Bunyip in 1998. Suburban Comeng trains were used by V/Line to provide services from Melbourne to Warragul in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In 1993, passenger services from Sale to Bairnsdale were withdrawn, leading to massive protests. They were reinstated in 2004 as part of the Linking Victoria program. The line was upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project in 2005 and the last of the overhead wires were removed, except for a short section to the Melbourne side of Bunyip station.

In March 2013 the service was suspended east of Traralgon because of safety problems with level crossings. Rail services resumed in October 2013.

==Services==
Services to Traralgon operate approximately hourly every day, with a higher frequency during the weekday peak periods. Between and Pakenham, services generally stop at , , , and . One service during the weekday peak also stops at . At metropolitan stations, trains running towards Traralgon and Bairnsdale only pick up passengers, and trains running towards Southern Cross only set down passengers. 

Local services stop at all stations between Pakenham and Traralgon, but services during peak periods run express from Pakenham to , Garfield to , and through and . One morning peak service terminates and originates at Flinders Street instead of Southern Cross. During weekdays off-peak, Traralgon services only stop at Richmond in the afternoon and evening.

From Monday to Saturday there are three daily return services to Bairnsdale. Two return services operate to Bairnsdale and one return service operates to Sale on Sunday. At Bairnsdale, trains connect with road coach services to Orbost, Batemans Bay and Canberra. All Bairnsdale services as of September 2024 are operated by V/Line VLocity diesel multiple-unit trains, with the last N class locomotive-hauled service operating on 14 September 2024.

<doc id="1196104" wikidata="Q2264936" url="?curid=1196104" title="Done with Mirrors">
<text>Done with Mirrors is the eighth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on November 4, 1985. It marked the return to the band of guitarists Joe Perry, who left in 1979 and Brad Whitford, who departed in 1981. The band&#x27;s first album on Geffen Records, it was intended as their ‘comeback’. However, the record failed to live up to commercial expectations despite positive reviews.

==Background==
Brad Whitford revealed that producer Ted Templeman wanted to capture the band&#x27;s aggressive, &quot;out of control freight train&quot; sound by removing the red light indicating that recording was underway (a technique he had used to capture Van Halen&#x27;s sound). Templeman told the band to run through the songs in the studio and recorded them without their knowledge. Whitford referred to the nerves generated when knowingly recording songs as &quot;the red light blues&quot;.

&quot;I had a great time making that record,&quot; Templeman told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Geoff Edgers, &quot;and Steven was one of the most amazing guys. But we had to do that record in Berkeley because they didn&#x27;t want those guys to score (drugs). They didn&#x27;t want them to be in L.A. or San Francisco. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the board. As a producer, if you know your room and the mic preamps, you know how things are going to sound. I don&#x27;t think I made Joey&#x27;s drums sound as good as they could have or Joe&#x27;s guitar.&quot;

Joe Perry recalled recording in a 2022 interview: &quot;[...] with the rest of the songs, there was a vibe to them where they were just raw and dirty. I still wish I could have maybe polished a few more things or maybe put a couple more overdubs on it, but all in all, I think it did what it was supposed to do. I think it kind of showed me what we needed to do, what we were, and where we needed to be for the next one. I think we had to do that record to get to the next step and really take ourselves out of the usual way we were writing and recording.&quot;

&quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot; was a rerecording of the title track from the first album by the Joe Perry Project, with altered lyrics and melody. According to Chuck Eddy, Aerosmith&#x27;s version is tougher than the original, &quot;while still appropriately letting Joe&#x27;s guitar talk–like an elephant, no less-–while Tyler discussed somebody being his &#x27;brand-new drug&#x27;.&quot; The music of &quot;The Reason a Dog&quot; have been compared to the Police&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Sun&quot; (1981), while its lyrics espouse &quot;tail-wagging canines teaching male-nagging spouses life lessons&quot;. Elsewhere, &quot;Shela&quot; is a syncopated song which, according to Eddy, &quot;almost goes disco, at least in the mid-1980s, ZZ Top sense of the word&quot;, while &quot;Gypsy Boots&quot; rides an AC/DC-esque riff until a switch to bass vamps near its conclusion. The final songs on the vinyl edition are the blues song &quot;She&#x27;s on Fire&quot; and the fast, straightforward R&amp;B song &quot;The Hop&quot;, featuring blues harp, whereas cassette and CD versions conclude with &quot;Darkness&quot;, a dirge that Eddy says connects &quot;foreboding old Aerosmith alley crawls like &#x27;Seasons of Wither&#x27; with more lucrative Tin Pan Alley moves to come.&quot;

Viacom (MTV &amp; VH1) executive Doug Herzog recalled that, after this album, &quot;Aerosmith was done… They were a little bit of a joke.&quot; Eddy speculated that the album&#x27;s failure may have been due to the &quot;kick-the-coke-habit pun&quot; of the title, or the lead single and first song being a remake of a five-year-old Joe Perry Project song. However, they would revive their career in 1986 with a landmark remake of 1975&#x27;s &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with hip-hop group Run DMC, followed by an album that would eventually go 5× Platinum – &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; – in 1987.

&quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; is the last Aerosmith record written without the aid of outside songwriters, as of &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;

==Packaging and title==
In keeping with the title, all the text (bar the catalog number and UPC) on the original releases, including all text in the booklet of the first CD pressing, were written back to front, to be read by holding it to a mirror. Re-releases flip the artwork so it can be read without a mirror, additionally adding the band&#x27;s logo. As a result, the original CD (which came in a longbox) is a collector&#x27;s item.

The title refers both to illusions that are &quot;done with mirrors&quot;, and the laying out of drugs such as cocaine, traditionally snorted off a mirror.

== Reception ==
&quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; received mostly positive reviews. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that, given the &quot;bad records&quot; Aerosmith had made in the preceding decade, he did not expect to enjoy the &quot;touching reunion&quot; of &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, but praised it &quot;against all odds&quot;, saying: &quot;if you can stand the crunch, you&#x27;ll find more get-up-and-go on the first side than on any dozen random neogarage EP&#x27;s.&quot; Also reviewing it for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Eddy considered it superior to other then-recent comeback albums by Tina Turner, the Clash, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan and John Fogerty. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Jimmy Guterman wrote that unlike the best heavy metal albums, &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; is &quot;the work of burned-out lugheads whose lack of musical imagination rivals their repugnant lyrics.&quot; He found &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot; to be an enjoyable, derivative opening song, but criticised the remaining songs for their &quot;vicious sexism&quot; as well as Perry&#x27;s &quot;rote and lazy&quot; guitar leads and Tyler&#x27;s &quot;arena shouts&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it the finest Aerosmith album since &quot;Rocks&quot; (1976), saying that unlike its immediate predecessors, &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; is &quot;powered by the same smart-assed lyrics and filthy guitars that formed the core of Aerosmith&#x27;s best songs.&quot; He also considers it superior to &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1987), the album that revived the group&#x27;s commercial and critical fortunes. In &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; (2006), Martin C. Strong describes &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; as Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;best effort since the 70&#x27;s heyday,&quot; while &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; (1999) contributor Michael Andrews wrote that it &quot;signalled a return to form&quot;, highlighting &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot; as its finest track. Colin Larkin, in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1997), called the album &quot;a tentative first step&quot; for Aerosmith, following the classic lineup&#x27;s reformation but prior to Tyler&#x27;s and Perry&#x27;s drug rehabilitation programmes and the success of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;.

Reviewing the album for the book &quot;Aerosmith&quot; (2011), Eddy deems it to be &quot;the last uncompromisingly hard-rocking album Aerosmith made&quot;. He finds it superior to &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; (1982), its predecessor, because &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; is &quot;almost entirely the guitarists&#x27; and the rhythm section&#x27;s record, all big, fat chunky funky boxy boogie riffs. The songs are too concise to get complicated, and they don&#x27;t need to. There may be no other Aerosmith album that so fully opts for rhythm over melody. Which isn&#x27;t to say the songs aren&#x27;t catchy, just that the band&#x27;s Beatles-pomp side is nowhere to be found.&quot; He considers the opening two songs to be the best and says, while the remaining songs are not &quot;earthshaking&quot;, the record &quot;just keeps on punching.&quot;

===Band opinions===
On VH1 Classic&#x27;s &quot;That Metal Show&quot;, Joey Kramer expressed his dislike of &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, claiming the band &quot;never really finished it&quot;. Joe Perry was similarly dismissive: &quot;&quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is our least inspired record. But I&#x27;ve heard fans really like it so I&#x27;m not gonna stand there and tell &#x27;em, &#x27;No, it sucks.&#x27; We had to do that record to get to the next one so it served its purpose. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s up to the standard of some of our others.&quot; In 1987, Perry said that &quot;&quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; was the best record we could do at the time, but it wasn&#x27;t the best record we can do. We should have had a month with those tracks as they sit on that record, instead of having one week which is what we had.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1991, Eddy ranked &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; at number 409 in his list of the 500 best heavy metal albums. Believing the record was the only mid-1980s musical &#x27;comeback&#x27; that lived up to its hype, he highlighted the chaotic opening song where Perry&#x27;s guitar works similarly to a horn section, &quot;My Fist Your Face&quot; for its &quot;hyperbolically misogynous rap about teenybop hookers and Betty Boop&quot;, the AC/DC, Police and ZZ Top touchstones on the succeeding songs, the belated &quot;show-offy&quot; ending of &quot;Gypsy Boots&quot;, and the &quot;Chuck Berry-gone-heavy danceability&quot; of &quot;The Hop&quot;. He added: &quot;Rocking too hard for AOR, it died on the charts, and the band got scared&quot;, leading to their commercial reinvention on &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1987).

<doc id="1196107" wikidata="Q711059" url="?curid=1196107" title="Kenny Garrett">
<text>Kenny Garrett (born October 9, 1960) is an American post-bop jazz musician and composer who gained recognition in his youth as a member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra and for his time with Miles Davis&#x27;s band. His primary instruments are alto and soprano saxophone and flute. Since 1985, he has pursued a solo career.

==Biography==
Kenny Garrett was born in Detroit, Michigan, on October 9, 1960. He attended Mackenzie High School. His father was a carpenter who played tenor saxophone as a hobby. Garrett&#x27;s own career as a saxophonist took off when he joined the Duke Ellington Orchestra, under the leadership of Mercer Ellington, in 1978. Garrett also played and recorded with Art Blakey, Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, and Woody Shaw before developing his career as a leader.

In 1984, Garrett recorded his first album as a bandleader, &quot;Introducing Kenny Garrett&quot;, on the CrissCross label. In the year, he became the founding member of Out of the Blue which was produced by Blue Note Records.
In 1986, Garrett became a member of Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers.

Garrett signed to the Warner Bros. Records label, and beginning with &quot;Black Hope&quot; in 1992, he recorded eight albums for them. His music sometimes exhibits Asian influences, an aspect which is especially prevalent in his 2006 Grammy-nominated recording &quot;Beyond the Wall&quot;.

Garrett joined the &quot;Five Peace Band&quot; of Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Christian McBride and Brian Blade/Vinnie Colaiuta around 2008. The CD &quot;Five Peace Band – Live&quot; won a Grammy Award in 2010.

In 2011, Garrett was presented with an Honorary Doctorate in Music from Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenny Garrett Honorary Doctorate/Commencement Speech at Berklee&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett also was the Commencement Speaker for graduates.

In 2012, Garrett received a Soul Train Award nomination for his 2012 studio album &quot;Seeds from the Underground&quot; in the Best Traditional Jazz Artist/Group category. Also in 2012, Grammy nominations for &quot;Seeds from the Underground&quot; followed in the Best Jazz Instrumental Album and Best Improvised Jazz Solo categories, and &quot;Seeds From The Underground&quot; received an NAACP Image Award nomination in the Outstanding Jazz Album category. In 2013, Garrett won an Echo Award in the Saxophonist of the Year category.

Kenny Garrett&#x27;s &quot;Pushing the World Away&quot; album received a Grammy nomination in the Best Jazz Instrumental Album category in 2013. He followed with &quot;Do Your Dance!&quot; (2016), &quot;Sounds from the Ancestors&quot; (2021) and released his first electronic album, &quot;Who Killed AI?&quot; (2024), in collaboration with electronic producer/instrumentalist Svoy.

* 2023: Chevalier de l&#x27;ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Ministère de la Culture, République de France https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordre_des_Arts_et_des_Lettres

==Influence==

<text>Contumeliosus of Riez was a sixth century Bishop of Riez in Gaul. Pope John II deposed Contumeliosus in 534 for adulterous behaviour and authorized Caesarius of Arles to appoint a temporary bishop to the diocese. Contumeliosus&#x27; deposition is notable for being the first act of jurisdiction of this kind recorded of a bishop of Rome.

==Life and fall==
Contumeliosus was the bishop of Riez in Gaul, and a sufficiently learned man that Bishop Avitus of Vienne forwarded to him some of his works for editing. Contumeliosus was accused of adultery and alienation of church property. At a Council of Marseilles, convened in 533 by Caesarius, Metropolitan Archbishop of Arles, Contumeliosus admitted to the charges and was deposed. Archbishop Caesarius then wrote Pope John II regarding the disposition of the case.

In 534 Pope John, wrote to Caesarius, to the bishops of Gaul, and to the clergy of Riez, directing the guilty bishop be confined to a monastery where he might perform an appropriate penance. No time period was apparently specified. John&#x27;s successor Pope Agapetus I accepted an appeal from Contumeliosus, and he ordered Caesarius of Arles to grant the accused a new trial before papal delegates. Agapetus charged Caesarius with cruelty and injustice in his proceedings against Contumeliosus, although he had acted in accord with Gallican usage and had defended the discipline of the Church. Of two surviving letters of John to Caesarius, both dated 18 July 535, one is about the dispute over Contumeliosus (Mansi, viii. p. 856).

<text>Caesarius of Arles (; 468/470 27 August 542 AD), sometimes called &quot;of Chalon&quot; (&quot;Cabillonensis&quot; or &quot;Cabellinensis&quot;) from his birthplace Chalon-sur-Saône, was the foremost ecclesiastic of his generation in Merovingian Gaul. Caesarius is considered to be of the last generation of church leaders of Gaul who worked to integrate large-scale ascetic elements into the Western Christian tradition. William E. Klingshirn&#x27;s study of Caesarius depicts Caesarius as having the reputation of a &quot;popular preacher of great fervour and enduring influence&quot;. Among those who exercised the greatest influence on Caesarius were Augustine of Hippo, Julianus Pomerius, and John Cassian.

The most important problem for Caesarius was the efficiency of the bishop&#x27;s fulfillment of his pastoral duties. By that time, preaching had already become part of the standard church service in Gaul; many bishops recognized the importance of such a means of teaching morals and encouraged it. However, Caesarius&#x27; enthusiasm was outstanding in its own way, and he urged his clergy to preach as often as possible, in the church and outside it, to the willing and the opposing. Caesarius&#x27; sermon topics generally dealt with moral issues.

== Life ==

Caesarius was born at what is now Chalon-sur-Saône, to Roman-Burgundian parents in the last years of the Western Empire. His sister, Caesaria, to whom he addressed his &quot;Regula ad Virgines&quot; (&quot;Rule for Virgins&quot;), would later preside over the convent he had founded. At the time of his birth, Germanic kings &quot;de facto&quot; governed Burgundy despite nominal Roman administration. Unlike his parents, Caesarius developed a very strong and intense feeling for religion which alienated him from his family for the majority of his adolescence. Caesarius left home at seventeen and studied under Bishop Sylvester for a few years. Afterwards, he found his way to Lérins (Lerinum), an island monastery, which was known to be a major dynamo for creative forces of work in the Church of Roman Gaul. After training as a monk at Lérins he devoted himself to reading and applying the scripture in hopes of improving the quality and organization of Christian life and serving the poor. He rapidly became master of all the learning and discipline the monastery communicated and was appointed cellarer. However, he proved unpopular at Lérins when, as cellarer of the monastery, he withheld food from monks because he felt they were insufficiently austere. As a result, the abbot Porcarius removed Caesarius from his post, whereupon he began starving himself; the abbot intervened and sent Caesarius to Arles ostensibly for medical care. After living at Lérins for over a decade and his health steadily decreasing from monastic over-exertion, Caesarius sought out a different clerical Christian community in Arles.

Upon arriving in the city, the &quot;Vita Caesarii&quot; claims that Caesarius discovered, completely to his surprise, that the bishop of Arles - Aeonius - was a kinsman from Chalon (&quot;concivis pariter et propinquus&quot; - &quot;at once a fellow citizen and a relative&quot;). Aeonius later ordained his young relative deacon and then priest. For three years he presided over a monastery in Arles; but of this building no vestige is now left. 

At the death of Aeonius the clergy, citizens, and persons in authority proceeded, as Aeonius himself had suggested, to elect Caesarius to the vacant seat, although Klingshirn suggests that there may have been considerable local hostility, that Caesarius&#x27; election may have been heavily disputed and that another cleric, Iohannes, who appears in the episcopal &quot;fasti&quot; of Arles may have been elected bishop. Caesarius was consecrated in 502, being probably about 33 years of age. In the fulfilment of his new duties he was courageous and unworldly, but yet exhibited great power of kindly adaptation. He took great pains to induce the laity to join in the sacred offices, and encouraged inquiry into points not made clear in his sermons. He also ordered the people to study Holy Scripture at home, and treat the word of God with the same reverence as the sacraments. His concern for the poor and sick was famous throughout and beyond Gaul as he regularly provided ransom for prisoners and aided the sick and the poor. He was specially zealous in redeeming captives, even selling church ornaments for this purpose. 

By middle age, Caesarius had “become and was to remain the leading ecclesiastical statesman and spiritual force of his age”. In September 506 he presided over the Council of Agde in Languedoc. Attended by thirty-five bishops, it dealt primarily with church discipline.

As bishop, Caesarius lived in a political world whose main theme was competition for Southern Gallic control among the Visigothic, Ostrogothic and Frankish kingdoms which led him to the constant ransoming of victims during these wars. The aftermath of a siege in 507–508 between the Burgundians and Franks and Visigothic and Ostrogothic kingdoms was devastating to its citizens. Peasants had no food supply and were in danger of enslavement, exile and death. Although Caesarius saved and ransomed many countryside citizens, his actions in redeeming captives were quite controversial. Although he ransomed many peasants of his country, he also ransomed numerous barbarians and enemies of the city. He defended himself by stating that barbarians were human beings and therefore had the potential to enter the City of God.

A notary named Licinianus denounced Caesarius to Alaric II as one who desired to subjugate the &quot;civitas&quot; of Arles to Burgundian rule. Caesarius was exiled to Bordeaux, but on the discovery of his innocence, was speedily allowed to return. He interceded for the life of his calumniator. Later, when Arles was besieged by Theodoric around the year 512, he was again accused of treachery and imprisoned. An interview with the Ostrogothic king at Ravenna the next year speedily dispelled these troubles, and the remainder of his episcopate was passed in peace.

Some rivalry appears to have existed in the sixth century between the sees of Arles and Vienne, but was adjusted by Pope Leo, whose adjustment was confirmed by Pope Symmachus. Caesarius was in favour at Rome. A book he wrote against the semi-Pelagians, entitled &quot;de Gratia et Libero Arbitrio&quot;, was approved and circulated by Pope Felix IV; and the canons passed at Orange were approved by Pope Boniface II. The learned antiquary Louis Thomassin believed him to have been the first Western bishop who received a pall from the pope. François Guizot in &quot;Civilisation en France&quot; cites part of one of Caesarius&#x27; sermons as that of a representative man of his age; while August Neander eulogizes his &quot;unwearied, active, and pious zeal, ready for every sacrifice in the spirit of love,&quot; and his moderation on the controversy concerning semi-Pelagianism.

The old Roman political order seemed to have little significance to Caesarius who instead directed his attitude to reflecting and accepting Christian pragmatism.

==Religious beginnings ==
According to William Klingshirn, &quot;Caesarius also has the reputation of being the faithful champion of Augustine of Hippo in the early middle ages.&quot; Thus Augustine&#x27;s writings are seen to have profoundly shaped Caesarius&#x27; vision of human community, both inside and outside the cloister; and Caesarius&#x27; prowess as a popular preacher is understood to follow from his close attention to the example of the bishop of Hippo. Caesarius was also highly influenced by his teacher, Julianus Pomerius. Pomerius had been inspired by the life of Augustine of Hippo too and insisted that bishops and members of the clergy live more like monks as opposed to aristocrats. This meant that any luxurious behaviour, such as participating in bountiful banquets, enlarging estates and enjoying “secular” learning, was condemned. Instead Pomerius urged bishops to give away all their riches and personal wealth as well as dress and eat simply. Caesarius&#x27;s monasticism led him to the movement of church reform and he became one of its most influential spokesmen. According to many of his testaments he stayed true to the teachings of Pomerius and Augustine by rejecting secular learning, shunning comfortable living and organizing his clergy into monastic living.

Christianization in the late Roman and Early Medieval West was a slow, inconsistent and incomplete social and religious change. It required the building of churches, conversion of elites and a widespread adoption of Christian self-identity with a system of Christian values, practices and beliefs. The church was constantly struggling against the survival of superstitions and pagan practices that were widely common among communities and common folk. However, it was only with the consent and participation of local populations that these religious changes were able to take effect. Therefore, as Klingshirn so carefully puts it, this process was reciprocal. Although the elites and theologians implemented all of the goals and strategies, it was up to the peasants and townspeople of local communities to accept these practices.

Caesarius composed two rules, one for men (&quot;Ad Monachos&quot;), the other for women (&quot;Ad Virgines&quot;). The rule for monks is based on that of Lérins, as handed down by oral tradition. This rule soon gave way to the Rule of Columbanus.

As a preacher, Caesarius displayed great knowledge of Scripture, and was eminently practical in his exhortations. Besides reproving ordinary vices of humanity, he had often to contend against lingering pagan practices, as auguries, or heathen rites on the &quot;calends.&quot; His sermons on the Old Testament are not critical, but dwell on its typical aspects.

Several volumes of his sermons have been published in &quot;Sources Chrétiennes&quot;.

==Writings and teachings==

Caesarius has over 250 surviving sermons in his corpus. His sermons reveal him as a pastor dedicated to the formation of the clergy and the moral education of the laity. He preached on Christian beliefs, values, and practices against pagan syncretism. He emphasizes the life of a Christian as well as the love of God, reading the scriptures, asceticism, psalmody, love for one&#x27;s neighbour, and the judgement that would come.

Through Pomerius&#x27;s teachings, it is logical to conclude that many of Caesarius&#x27; homilies and writings were influenced greatly by Augustine. Caesarius&#x27; writings were known to be adapted as he reworked many other philosophers&#x27; introductions and conclusions, especially those of Augustine. Many of his writings and sermons, including the popular &quot;Vita Caesarii&quot;, were ordered to be written in French, German, Italian, and Hispanic. Caesarius did not believe that his readings and sermons should be restricted to the clergy. He did not just address the upper class and elite but instead preached to many literate and near-literate bishops, abbots, parish priests, and monks. He encouraged the clergy to read to both themselves and others. He targeted the illiterate and asked that they hire others to read to them after church in order to absorb the divine lessons. Caesarius encouraged reading divine lessons both at church and in their homes, at night and during the day, alone and with family.

More than just learning and understanding the lessons, Caesarius emphasized that a “believer who does not share what he has learned, is not achieving what God intended&quot;. Therefore, the believer is given a large responsibility as the &quot;lectio&quot; (divine reading) is God and therefore he should not be denied access to what belongs to Him. Caesarius believed that Christian People were God&#x27;s new &quot;elect&quot; and he idealized incorporating men of places from all over the world into a believing, peaceful, and loving human community. This belief parallels Augustinian work as Augustine often referred to the &quot;populus christianus&quot; which can be translated as the Christian People. Revelation tells that God made a covenant with the &quot;populus christianus&quot; and the Christian epoch was predicted in all of the scriptures.

Scholars have remarked on two aspects of Caesarius&#x27;s teaching and activity that deserve considerable attention. The first aspect deals with Caesarius who was stated to be “the creative leader who arranged at the Council of Orange in 529 a resolution of the century of disputes about grace and ‘good works’ which followed Augustine&#x27;s death.

===Council of Orange, 529===
The most important local council over which Caesarius presided was that of Orange (529). Its statements on the subject of grace and free agency have been eulogized by modern historians (see, e.g., Canon Bright, &quot;Church History&quot;, ch. xi. ad fin.). The following propositions are laid down in the Council of Orange&#x27;s canon 25:

:&quot;This also do we believe, in accordance with the Catholic faith, that after grace received through baptism, all the baptized are able and ought, with the aid and co-operation of Christ, to fulfil all duties needful for salvation, provided they are willing to labour faithfully. But that some men have been predestinated to evil by divine power, we not only do not believe, but if there be those who are willing to believe so evil a thing, we say to them with all abhorrence anathema. This also do we profess and believe to our soul&#x27;s health, that in every good work, it is not we who begin, and are afterwards assisted by Divine mercy, but that God Himself, with no preceding merits on our part, first inspires within us faith and love.&quot;

On the express ground that these doctrines are as needful for the laity as for the clergy, certain distinguished laymen (&quot;illustres ac magnifici viri&quot;) were invited to sign these canons. They are accordingly subscribed by eight laymen, and at least twelve bishops, including Caesarius.
The Council of Orange in 529 was said to have condemned &quot;the teaching of grace that predominated in southern Gaul in favor of a modified Augustinian position.&quot;

===Sermons===
The second aspect of Caesarius&#x27;s teaching that deserves attention is his sermons. As mentioned previously, his corpus consists of over 250 surviving sermons. Caesarius was determined to edit, shorten, and simplify his sermons in order to make them more effective and available to the existing patristic tradition. About 1/3 of his sermons are efforts of this sort. His works travelled to all parts of the Christian West, spreading his medieval sermon tradition and its topics of Christian love, the meaning of the last Judgement, the rights of the poor and the notion of Christianity. His writings were used by monks in Germany, repeated in Anglo-Saxon poetry and turned up in the important works of Gatianus of Tours and Thomas Aquinas.

In DelCogliano&#x27;s article, he mentions two other historians who studied and presented new critical texts of Caesarius&#x27;s sermons. The two historians, Courreau and Vogüé, noted that although Caesarius&#x27;s monastic sermons contain their own perspective and emphasis, his teachings are largely consistent throughout all of his sermons. Certain recurring themes include the expectations of monks in the monastery (i.e., important to attain Christian salvation within the safe haven of a monastery with the help of God) as well as being assisted on this Christian journey by fellow brothers who must offer mutual support. Caesarius, unlike other monks like Anthony the Great, did not believe in solitude in order to be blessed with the Grace of God; instead he emphasized brothers living amongst each other and providing edification and a good example to one another.

===A Rule for women===
Caesarius’ &quot;Regula virginum&quot; (512), also known as the &quot;Rule for Virgins&quot;, is the first western rule written exclusively for women. In this text, Caesarius argues for the practice of claustration, the complete containment of women in the monastery from their entry until death. Caesarius also created a strict regime for women in the monasteries to adhere to, specifying times for prayer, limits on earthly luxuries such as fine clothes and elaborate decoration, and standards of modesty and piety. Caesarius begins the &quot;Rule&quot; by prefacing that the virgins for which he was writing this rule were the &quot;gems of the Church&quot; as they, &quot;with God&#x27;s help, evade the jaws of spiritual wolves.&quot; He also composed a letter of guidance, &quot;Vereor&quot;, for the women of his religious community in its early stages. As mentioned earlier, Caesarius was captured and later returned from Bordeaux. After he returned he began to build a monastery for women outside of Arles. The monastery was built for a group of ascetic women living under the spiritual direction of his sister, Caesaria. It can be assumed that most of the women entering the monastery were from elite families, as there were strict provisions in &quot;Regula Virginum&quot; against having servants, luxurious clothes, and excessive decoration. There had been no monastery for women in Arles which allowed Caesarius, possibly in the imitation of Augustine, to provide women with an equal opportunity for a monastic life. Caesarius viewed the women in the monastery as having a religious advantage in being separated from the anxieties and responsibilities of daily life in the city, as they were able to devote themselves to a life of piety:

“And therefore I ask you, oh sacred virgins and souls dedicated to God, who with you lamps shining await with clear conscience the coming of the Lord, that, because you know that I labored to establish a monastery for you, you with your prayers might ask that I be made a companion on your journey; and that, when you shall enter joyfully into the kingdom with the wise and holy virgins, you might obtain by your plea that I not remain outside with the foolish ones.” 

It was Caesarius&#x27;s goal to attain security of his place both among the Church elites of Gaul as well as in heaven through the creation of the monastery. By creating the monastery and writing the Rule, Caesarius was able to make for himself a place among the great Church thinkers of Late Antique Gaul. Simultaneously, through the intercession of the women in the monastery praying for him, Caesarius believed he could confirm his place in heaven after death.

Caesarius kept the monastery in his family until his death. Around 525, he appointed his niece, Caesaria the Younger, to succeed his sister.

==Influence==
As the occupant of an important see, the bishop of Arles exercised considerable official, as well as personal, influence. Caesarius was liberal in the loan of sermons, and sent suggestions for discourses to priests and even bishops living in Spain, Italy, and elsewhere in Gaul. The great doctrinal question of his age and country was that of semi-Pelagianism. Caesarius, though evidently a disciple of Augustine, displayed in this respect considerable independence of thought. His vigorous denial of anything like predestination to evil has caused a difference in the honour paid to his memory, according as writers incline respectively towards the Jesuit or Jansenist views concerning divine grace.

In Daly&#x27;s article on Caesarius of Arles, he suggested that Caesarius in many ways may have anticipated the medieval notion of Christendom. His concern for others, redemption of captives and establishing bonds of peace, have been seen as a function of ‘his basic theology of love’. Unlike Augustine, who was a supporter and founder of the theology of Christian love, Caesarius stressed the clarification and integration of implications for spiritual activism. Caesarius promoted that God put the exercise of love in every man&#x27;s reach. Klingshirn backs up this statement in his article when he describes how Caesarius was concerned with the barbarians and enemies of Arles as they were still within the City of God and therefore deserved redemption.

According to the previously mentioned scholars and historians who have written on Caesarius such as Arbesmann, Daly, DelCogliano, Ferreiro and Klingshirn, Caesarius lived through an era full of many societal shifts. Historians have stated that Caesarius was caught up in its early stages and lacked historical “hindsight and perspective” to this era. However, he witnessed and understood the beginning of the vast societal shifts which surrounded him and intentionally set out to shape this process. This was an influential stance as it has been said that the displacement of Roman by European civilization was a long-lasting, complex, and mystifying process. Caesarius dreamed and saw an “expanding, world-embracing, world-uniting society”. Caesarius emphasized and spread his treatises and beliefs of patristic tradition to men and women around Arles and surrounding cities. This recognizable social model occurred in a time where social communities were disappearing. Caesarius helped to foresee the institutional shapes of medieval Christendom and may have helped create it, with his ideas circulating for a millennium in the medieval West.

<doc id="1196122" wikidata="Q517254" url="?curid=1196122" title="The Master Musicians of Joujouka">
<text>The Master Musicians of Joujouka are a collective of Jbala Sufi trance musicians, serving as a modern representation of a centuries-old music tradition. The collective was first documented by Western journalists in the early 1950s, and was brought to widespread international attention by Brian Jones in 1969. They have collaborated with many Western rock and jazz musicians.

The collective includes more than 50 musicians from the village of Jajouka (sometimes spelled as Joujouka or Zahjouka), in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco. All members are the sons of previous members, and adopt the surname &quot;Attar&quot; (&quot;perfume maker&quot;). In the 1990s, the collective split into two factions, with the other currently known as The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar.

==History==
The Master Musicians of Joujouka perform a variety of Sufi music that is believed to be more than one thousand years old. The collective became an item of interest for members of the Beat Generation in the 1950s, when Moroccan folklorist Mohamed Hamri informed European colleagues about the group&#x27;s music. Hamri operated a restaurant in Tangier that was frequented by European musicians and artists, and the Master Musicians often played there. Brion Gysin, Paul Bowles, and William S. Burroughs all wrote about the group and one of them may have coined the name &quot;The Master Musicians of Joujouka&quot; during this period. Timothy Leary famously, but erroneously, described the group and its music as &quot;4000 years old&quot;, which has been repeated in many sources. The figure actually applies to previous Sufi traditions and not to the group or its music specifically.

Brian Jones visited the collective many times while traveling in Morocco and in 1969 became the first Western musician to record with them. The album &quot;Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka&quot; was released in 1971 after Jones&#x27;s death. The collective played on the 1973 album &quot;Dancing in Your Head&quot; by Ornette Coleman. Arnold Stahl oversaw recording of the double album &quot;Tribe Ahl Serif: Master Musicians of Jajouka&quot; in 1974.

In the early 1990s, the collective split into two factions, as first reported by visiting musician Lee Ranaldo. The faction fostered by Mohamed Hamri, and led by Ahmed Attar, retained the name &quot;The Master Musicians of Joujouka&quot;. Meanwhile, another faction led by Bachir Attar, whose father had led the group during the Brian Jones period, took on the name &quot;The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar&quot;. The second group attracted protests at concerts in the United Kingdom, and international journalists noted that the schism created discord in the collective&#x27;s home village. Other journalists and fans conceded that both groups were working to preserve their ancient musical heritage.

The collective retaining the original name, and led by Ahmed Attar, resumed recording in the 1990s, releasing the album &quot;Joujouka Black Eyes&quot; in 1995. They appeared on the various-artists albums &quot;Sufi: Moroccan Trance II&quot; in 1996 and &quot;10%: File under Burroughs&quot; (a tribute to early supporter William S. Burroughs) the same year. Their most recent studio album is &quot;Boujeloud,&quot; released in 2006. In 2011 they made a guest appearance on the album &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot; by Jane&#x27;s Addiction. The group frequently appears at music festivals in Europe, and made an acclaimed live appearance at the BBC Radio 4, hosted by Jarvis Cocker, in 2017. The same year the group toured Japan headlining Festival de Frue. In April 2019, they collaborated with the Orb to create the live sound for the Dior Cruise Show in Marrakesh under the musical direction of Michel Gaubert. They continue to operate out of their home village of Jajouka, where they also host an annual festival that is limited to 50 guests. On 30 May 2023, Glastonbury Festival announced that the band would open the main Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival 2023, playing alongside Arctic Monkeys and Guns N&#x27; Roses.

In 1984, Banerjee portrayed Dr. Aziz Ahmed in David Lean&#x27;s film of &quot;A Passage to India&quot;, bringing him to the attention of western audiences. He was nominated for a BAFTA Award for the role in 1986, and won the Evening Standard British Film Award and NBR Award (National Board Review, USA) for it. In April 1985, Banerjee received the &quot;Show-a-Rama Award&quot; from the Motion Picture Association of America as &quot;New International Star&quot;.

He acted in Merchant Ivory Productions &quot;Hullabaloo Over Georgie and Bonnie&#x27;s Pictures&quot;, Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Shatranj Ke Khilari&quot; and &quot;Ghare Baire&quot; and in Mrinal Sen&#x27;s &quot;Mahaprithivi&quot;. On the set of Gunday starring Priyanka Chopra, Mr. Banerjee has said that he feels &quot;all work is a challenge and therefore fun&quot;.

Though has been involved with Bollywood in recent years, Banerjee is primarily associated with the Bengali film industry. He also plays character roles from time to time in the British cinema.

He was also cast in the critically acclaimed role of &quot;Jesus&quot; in the 1988 production of the York Mystery Plays, by director Steven Pimlott. He was the first Asian to play a lead role in British Theatre.

In 1991, BBC and CBC of Canada produced a documentary titled &quot;Return Journey&quot;, directed by John McGreevy. Banerjee, Plácido Domingo, Kiri Te Kanawa and Jackie Stewart were featured as celebrities who refused to live away from their home countries.

Banerjee is the only person in India who has won the National Award in three categories: as a cinematographer, for his documentary &quot;Where No Journeys End&quot; (which, in competition with 3100 entries from 27 countries, also won the Gold Award at the Houston International Film Festival); as a director, for his documentary &quot;The Splendour of Garhwal and Roopkund&quot;; and as an actor (Best Supporting Actor) for his work in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Ghare Baire&quot;.

==Political career==
Banerjee unsuccessfully contested the 1991 Lok Sabha election in Calcutta North West from the Bharatiya Janata Party. He got 89,155 votes and stood third.

As an active member of the BJP, he was critical of Mulayam Singh Yadav&#x27;s order to shoot the Karsevaks who had once climbed the Babri Masjid prior to its demolition.

He has been highly critical of what he called Navjot Singh Sidhu&#x27;s pacifist attitude to terrorism exported from Pakistan.

<text>Guardians of Order was a Canadian company founded in 1996 by Mark C. MacKinnon in Guelph, Ontario. The company&#x27;s business output consisted of role-playing games (RPGs). Their first game is the anime inspired &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot;. In 2006 Guardians of Order ceased operations due to overwhelming debt.

== Publication history ==

The &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot; game used the Tri-Stat System. The system would later be modified for use in other games and be more generally named the &quot;Tri-Stat dX&quot; system. Most of Guardians of Order&#x27;s games use some form of the &quot;Tri-Stat dX&quot; system.

After &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot;, Guardians of Order would go on to achieve significant success with &quot;The Sailor Moon Role-Playing Game and Resource Book&quot;. The game was built on &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot; but featured an extensive reference to the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; universe. Guardians of Order acquired licenses and published &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot;-based RPGs for a number of other anime series including &quot;Dominion&quot;, &quot;Demon City Shinjuku&quot;, and &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;. After &quot;El Hazard&quot;, the last such game, the company&#x27;s strategy with licensed anime series changed and it began issuing &quot;Ultimate Fan Guides&quot; which served the same purpose while avoiding the need to reprint the same &quot;BESM&quot;-based mechanics. All of these books included game statistics for characters in the series as well as extensive episode guides and character summaries.

Guardians of Order expanded beyond anime based games when the &quot;Tri-Stat dX&quot; system was adopted for the superhero game &quot;Silver Age Sentinels&quot;.

Guardians of Order later acquired the rights to publish the &quot;Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game&quot; from Phage Press. Guardians of Order licensed the rights to produce role-playing games set in existing fictional works. These include games based on &quot;The Authority&quot;, &quot;Tékumel&quot;, and &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.

==History==
Mark C. MacKinnon created the company Guardians of Order to publish his anime game, &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot; (1997). Guardians of Order was founded by Mark C. MacKinnon in 1996. In 1998, Guardians of Order hired David Pulver. In 1999, Jeff Mackintosh was hired; and 2000 brought in Liz Fulda and Lucien Soulban. In 2002, Guardians of Order launched their &quot;Magnum Opus&quot; program, licensing the company&#x27;s intellectual property to third parties to create new games. By 2005, Guardians of Order downsized to just Mark C. MacKinnon.

Between February 14, 2006 and August 1, 2006 there were no official updates to the Guardians of Order website. There was speculation on the official forums that the company was out of business. On July 28, 2006 a post to George R. R. Martin&#x27;s official web site announced that Guardians of Order was out of business. In response, on August 1 Mark MacKinnon posted confirmation that Guardians of Order &quot;ceased operations.&quot; According to MacKinnon the company had too much debt. MacKinnon attempted to place Guardians of Orders games with other companies, and promised that existing orders would be filled. The company officially closed their doors August 1, 2006.

On September 9, 2006 ArtHaus Games, whose titles are published by White Wolf Publishing, announced that it had acquired the third edition of &quot;Big Eyes, Small Mouth&quot; which was slated to be released in April 2006. The announcement stated the company was &quot;extremely confident&quot; that a release date of January 2007 would be met and confirmed that those who pre-ordered and prepaid for the book would be &quot;in good hands,&quot; though it was also said that they have not taken on Guardians of Order&#x27;s liabilities.

On March 7, 2007 George R. R. Martin wrote that he had regained control of his intellectual property rights and was &quot;all square&quot; with Guardians of Order. As part of their settlement, Mr. Martin received all remaining stock of the limited edition version of the RPG. No further information regarding the settlement was revealed, nor the status of other creditors&#x27; claims on the property.

<doc id="1196144" wikidata="Q4828790" url="?curid=1196144" title="Avidyamaya and vidyamaya">
<text>Avidyamaya and Vidyamaya are concepts created by the Hindu sage Ramakrishna based on his mystical realizations. Literally, &quot;vidyamaya&quot; means &quot;wisdom-illusion&quot;, and &quot;avidyamaya&quot; means &quot;un-wisdom-illusion&quot;.

Ramakrishna implied that all things, good and bad, were &quot;maya&quot; (illusion). According to him, both love and hate, materialism and spirituality, egotism and generosity exist only due to our limited perception of Reality. However, he divided them into illusions that further bind us (&quot;avidyamaya&quot;) and illusions that take us further onto the dispelling of maya (&quot;vidyamaya&quot;).

According to his Hindu school of thought, as one cannot trust one&#x27;s eyes before a trained magician, also the human five senses draw and drag us further into illusions and false conclusions. However, the embracing and realization of some concepts that are not sensual (i.e., of the senses), such as love, generosity, spirituality, all of them &quot;vidyamaya&quot;, take us further away from sticking to what we see, touch, smell, hear, taste.

Quote: &quot;Vidyamaya may be likened to the last few steps before the roof. Next is the roof, the realization of God.&quot;</text><links>

<doc id="1196148" wikidata="Q6736754" url="?curid=1196148" title="Mainstream Baptists">
<text>Mainstream Baptists is a network of Baptists in fourteen U.S. states that have organized to uphold historic Baptist principles, particularly separation of church and state, and to oppose Fundamentalism and Theocratic Calvinism within the Southern Baptist Convention. As such, it is not a denomination, but rather an organization that provides resources, support, and interagency communication. Organizations/agencies considered to share Mainstream Baptists and cooperate with and support the network are listed below under External links.

==Historic Baptist beliefs of Mainstream Baptists==
Source:

===Lordship of Christ===
*The heart of Baptist beliefs is the Lordship of Christ.
*Christ is Lord over the individual believer, he is Lord over the church, and he is Lord over the universe and all that is in it.
*Jesus Christ is the final authority in our individual lives, in our homes, in our churches, and in all our relationships with society and the world.
*Our ultimate loyalty and allegiance is to God&#x27;s Person, rather than to books, creeds, confessions, traditions, programs or procedures.

===Salvation by Grace Through Faith===
*&quot;For by grace have you been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast&quot;.
*Baptists believe that God&#x27;s love and grace is the only basis for any person&#x27;s relationship with God. The individual can do nothing to earn or deserve God&#x27;s love and forgiveness. Faith is not an effort or labor.
*Faith is receiving God&#x27;s love with an open heart and finding it transformed by God&#x27;s grace.

===Believer&#x27;s Baptism===
*Baptists baptize persons only after they make a personal confession of their faith in Christ.
*Baptists do not believe that a loving God condemns anyone for a sin they did not commit. Baptists do not view baptism as a remedy for original sin. Baptists do not baptize infants.
*Baptists practice baptism by totally immersing persons in water, rather than by sprinkling, pouring, or anointing persons with water.
*Baptism by immersion preserves the dramatic imagery of the meaning of baptism as a symbolic death, burial and resurrection. The symbolism of baptism pictures: the death, burial and resurrection of Christ who died for our sins and the believer&#x27;s own death to sin, burial of a sinful nature, and resurrection to a new life in Christ.

===Priesthood of All Believers and Liberty of Conscience===
*Baptists believe that all members are equal under God in the fellowship of the church. Jesus is the one mediator between God and humanity. Every human being has direct access to God through Christ.
*Every Christian is her or his own priest in that he or she is authorized to go directly to God for forgiveness of sins and to search the scriptures with confidence of being guided by the same Spirit that inspired those who wrote the Bible.
*Every Christian is a priest to others in that he or she is a member of a royal priesthood and responsible to Christ for ministering to others.

===Religious Liberty and the Separation of Church and State===
*&quot;Religious Liberty is the nursing mother of all liberty. Without it all other forms of liberty must soon wither and die. The Baptists grasped this conception of liberty in its full-orbed glory, from the very beginning. Their contention has been, is now, and must ever be, that it is the God-given and indefeasible right of every human being, to worship God or not, according to the dictates of his conscience; and, as long as he does not infringe on the rights of others, he is to be held accountable to God alone, for all his religious beliefs and practices.&quot; —George W. Truett

===Mainstream Baptists and the Bible===
*The Bible from a Mainstream Perspective. No human understanding of the Bible can be so exhaustive and authoritative as to merit use as an “instrument of doctrinal accountability.” Mainstream Baptists think it more prudent to leave every believer free to interpret the Bible according to the dictates of a conscience that is guided by the Holy Spirit.
*Though Mainstream Baptists insist on thinking for themselves, there is a broad consensus among them concerning the scriptures.
*Mainstream Baptists love and respect the Bible. It is a holy book in that it holds a separate and unique place. It is the story of God&#x27;s love. Each of us is part of that story. By identifying with this story, our lives receive meaning and direction.
*While Baptists love and respect the Bible, they do not worship it. The Bible is the written word of God. In and of itself it is paper and ink, words and sentences, and has no life. The Bible is not the supreme revelation of God—It points to and must be fulfilled and completed by God&#x27;s Living Word, Jesus Christ. As the only mediator between God and a person, he gives scriptures life by creating from them a spark of understanding in the individual. From that understanding He calls us to a personal relationship with Him. Those who respond in faith to God&#x27;s call, identify with His story and commit themselves to a life of discipleship. For them, the Bible becomes more than a reliable record of God&#x27;s revelation in the past. It is the authoritative tradition from which we view the horizons of life in both time and eternity.
*Baptists believe in the divine inspiration and human authorship of the Bible.

===Congregational Autonomy===
*Mainstream Baptists believe in congregational autonomy which means that every local congregation is under the direct Lordship of Christ. They are opposed to ecclesiastical hierarchies. Their churches are not subordinate to the rule of any denomination, convention, association, fellowship or any other religious body. They believe that Christ is in and is the head of every congregation of his people.
*Their churches operate democratically because they believe every other form of church government infringes on the Lordship of Christ. Every member is responsible for seeking and following the guidance of the Holy Spirit as they participate in the deliberations and work of the church. Each member has equal right to voice their convictions and to vote according to their conscience when the congregation makes decisions. They trust the spiritual discernment of the majority and act on it. They also realize that majorities can be mistaken and act with respect toward the consciences of a sometimes-prophetic minority.

===Cooperative Missions===

<doc id="1196159" wikidata="Q1463631" url="?curid=1196159" title="Permanent Vacation (Aerosmith album)">
<text>Permanent Vacation is the ninth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released by Geffen Records on August 25, 1987. The album marks the band&#x27;s shift to a pop-metal sound that they would maintain up to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Get a Grip&quot;.

It was their first to employ songwriters outside the band, instead of featuring songs solely composed by them. This came at the suggestion of executive John Kalodner. He also pushed the band to work with producer Bruce Fairbairn, who remained with them for another two albums. It was also the first Aerosmith album to be promoted by heavy music video airplay on MTV. Though &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; was intended to mark Aerosmith&#x27;s comeback, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; is often considered their true comeback, as it was the band&#x27;s first truly popular album since their reunion. &quot;Rag Doll&quot;, &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot; became major hits (all three charted in the Top 20) and helped &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; become the band&#x27;s greatest success in a decade.

&quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; has sold over five million copies in the U.S.

In the UK, it was the first Aerosmith album to attain both Silver (60,000 units sold) and Gold (100,000 units sold) certification by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving these in July 1989 and March 1990 respectively.

==Reception==
The album received mixed-to-positive reviews. In a retrospective assessment AllMusic gave the album four stars, and said &quot;despite the mostly stellar songwriting, which makes it a strong effort overall, some of the album&#x27;s nooks and crannies haven&#x27;t aged all that well because of Fairbairn&#x27;s overwrought production, featuring an exaggerated sleekness typical of most mid-&#x27;80s pop-metal albums&quot;. Dave Reynolds from &quot;Metal Forces&quot; magazine called the album &quot;a shit hot album and one I&#x27;m gonna play the hell out of&quot;. Robert Christgau graded the album a C+, saying Aerosmith were &quot;running out of gas again already&quot;.

&quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked the album as Aerosmith&#x27;s 6th best album explaining the ranking with, &quot;its lavish &#x27;80s production has definitely dated, but &#x27;Permanent Vacation&#x27; still ranks among the greatest musical comebacks of all time&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; also placed the album at No. 4 on their 2017 list of the &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1987&quot;. &quot;Loudersound&quot; placed the album on their list of the 20 best albums from 1987 and called it a &quot;collection of sublime pop-metal&quot;.

<doc id="1196169" wikidata="Q5089088" url="?curid=1196169" title="Check and Double Check">
<text>Check and Double Check is a 1930 American pre-Code comedy film produced and released by RKO Radio Pictures, based on the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio show. The title was derived from a catchphrase associated with the show. Directed by Melville W. Brown, from a screenplay by Bert Kalmar, J. Walter Ruben, and Harry Ruby, it starred Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll in blackface, in the roles of Amos Jones and Andy Brown, respectively, which they had created for the radio show. The film also featured Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club Orchestra.

==Plot==
Amos and Andy run the &quot;Fresh Air Taxicab Company, Incorpulated&quot; [sic], so named because their one taxi has no top. Their old vehicle has broken down, causing a traffic jam. Stuck in the traffic jam are John Blair and his wife, who were on their way to meet an old family friend, Richard Williams, at the train station. When the Blairs don&#x27;t show up, Williams makes his own way to their house and meets their daughter, Jean, who was also his childhood sweetheart. The two reignite their old flame, much to the chagrin of Ralph Crawford, who has been attempting to woo Jean himself.

That night, Amos and Andy plan to attend a meeting at their lodge, the Mystic Knights of the Sea. Brother member Kingfish hires them to transport Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club band to a party being given at the Blair estate. Meanwhile, Richard confides to John Blair his feelings for his daughter, and states that he has no intention of pursuing Jean unless he can afford to start his own business to support them. Richard&#x27;s family lost all their money after the death of his father. Richard&#x27;s grandfather used to own a large home in Harlem, and Richard hopes to find the deed to it, so that he can sell it for the capital needed to start his business. He thinks the deed must be hidden somewhere on the property itself. Unknown to Blair or Richard, Ralph is eavesdropping on their conversation.

Richard runs into Amos and Andy, who used to work for his father down south, and they are all happy to see one another. Having delivered their fare, the two cab drivers rush back to town to attend their lodge meeting. The lodge has an annual tradition where a pair of members must spend a night in a haunted house in Harlem and find a document, labeled &quot;Check and Double Check.&quot; Once they find it, they are to replace it, in a different location, with their own version, for the lodge members to find the following year. The haunted house in question in none other than the house previously owned by Richard&#x27;s grandfather.

As Amos and Andy are searching for their document, Ralph is also in the house with several of his cohorts, searching for the deed, in order to thwart Richard&#x27;s chances with Jean. Amos and Andy find their document, but then realize they didn&#x27;t bring any other paper to write their message to their lodge brothers. In searching for something to write on, they stumble on the deed to premises. As they are about to write their message on the back, they are interrupted by Ralph and his friends, who believe that the two have found the deed. In the confusion which ensues, the cab drivers hand over what everyone believes is the deed, before they scamper out of the building. However, when they return to the lodge, they realize that they had given the &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; paper to Ralph, instead of the deed. They don&#x27;t know the importance of the document they have, but they recognized Richard&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s signature on it, and intend to deliver it to Richard the following day.

After failing to find the deed, a heartbroken Richard leaves for the railway station, intending to return home. Amos and Andy arrive at the Blair house too late to give him the deed, but race to the station and are able to hand over the deed just before Richard&#x27;s train leaves. Now with the deed, Richard can sell the house, open his business, and marry Jean.

==Production==

The making of the picture posed several problems. Perhaps foremost was the fact that the characters of the program were portrayed as African Americans but were in fact entirely voiced by whites. This had posed no problem on the radio, but obviously would not be suitable for a film where the actors could be seen as well as heard. Rather than hire black actors for the roles and instruct them to imitate the stereotypical voices used by the radio performers, program creators Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll performed the roles themselves in blackface.

Another problem was the attempt to base a full-length picture on a 15-minute-long radio program. The film&#x27;s producers decided to flesh out the story with a love triangle involving white characters, essentially making Amos and Andy minor characters in what was marketed as a film about them.

===Music===
Duke Ellington and his band were invited to be a part of the film, not just to provide the music but also to appear performing in the film itself. This helped propel Ellington into a national spotlight.

The director did not want to give audiences the impression that Ellington&#x27;s band was racially integrated, and was worried that two band members were too light-skinned. So valve trombonist Juan Tizol, who was Puerto Rican, and clarinetist Barney Bigard, a Creole, wore stage makeup to appear as dark as Amos and Andy on film.

The songs included:
*&quot;Three Little Words&quot; – Music by Harry Ruby, lyrics by Bert Kalmar; performed by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Band, vocals by The Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Harry Barris and Al Rinker) (band members lip synched to the Rhythm Boys vocals)
*&quot;Nobody Knows But the Lord&quot; – Music by Harry Ruby, lyrics by Bert Kalmar; sung by lodge brothers
*&quot;Ring Dem Bells&quot; – Written by Duke Ellington; performed by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Band
*&quot;Old Man Blues&quot; – Written by Duke Ellington and Irving Mills; performed by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Band
*&quot;East St. Louis Toodle-O&quot; – Written by James &quot;Bubber&quot; Miley and Duke Ellington
*&quot;Am I Blue?&quot; – Music by Harry Akst, lyrics by Grant Clarke; partially sung by Freeman F. Gosden
*&quot;The Perfect Song&quot; – Words and music by Joseph Carl Breil; theme from the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio program

The Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Harry Barris, and Al Rinker) were brought in at the last minute to sing the vocals on &quot;Three Little Words&quot;, when Ellington&#x27;s drummer, Sonny Greer, got stage fright about performing on film. Bing Crosby was supposed to sing the song solo, but when director Melville Brown heard Crosby&#x27;s version, he reportedly said, &quot;This guy can&#x27;t sing&quot;, and the entire trio was brought in to record the song.

==Response==
The film was profitable for RKO, earning a profit of $260,000. However, Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy had no future with the studio, and were branded a freak attraction good for one film only. RKO had examined ticket-sale patterns, and determined that audiences had only been curious about seeing their two radio favorites. Once seen, their novelty and appeal were gone.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the best picture for children ever put on the screen&quot;. Mordaunt Hall, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave the film a lackluster review, praising the efforts of Gosden and Correll, while not being as kind to the rest of the cast. Gosden and Correll were themselves ashamed of the film, with Gosden calling it &quot;just about the worst movie ever,&quot; but it didn&#x27;t hurt their continued popularity on radio.

RKO did release two short subjects related to the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; franchise. These were animated cartoons produced by The Van Beuren Corporation in 1934: &quot;The Rasslin&#x27; Match&quot; and &quot;The Lion Tamer&quot;. Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll recorded their own dialect voices for the soundtracks. However, the projected series ended after only the two films. Gosden and Correll made one more motion-picture appearance (as guest stars in &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot;), but there were no further attempts at live-action portrayals of Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy until the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; television show (1951–1953), although the radio show continued to be a top-rated program throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

==Revivals==
In 1955 the RKO film library was sold to C&amp;C Television Corporation, which syndicated 16mm film prints to local television stations. Included in the package was &quot;Check and Double Check&quot;, which was telecast through the rest of the decade and into the 1960s while &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; still had a following on television. After the TV show was withdrawn due to civil-rights considerations, most local stations owning the RKO library opted to withdraw &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; as well.

In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Because of the film&#x27;s copyright-free status, film merchants copied C&amp;C Television prints of &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; for the home-movie market, and later for home video. Because &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; is no longer exhibited in public, fans of Gosden and Correll can only see the film in private showings.

<doc id="1196174" wikidata="Q7927046" url="?curid=1196174" title="Victoria Square, Adelaide">
<text>Victoria Square, also known as Tarntanyangga (formerly &quot;Tarndanyangga&quot;, ), is the central square of five public squares in the Adelaide city centre, South Australia.

It is one of six squares designed by the founder of Adelaide, Colonel William Light, who was Surveyor-General at the time, in his 1837 plan of the City of Adelaide which spanned the River Torrens Valley, comprising the city centre (South Adelaide) and North Adelaide. The square was named on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee after Princess Victoria, then heir presumptive of the British throne. In 2003, it was assigned a second name, Tarndanyangga (later amended to Tarntanyangga), in the Kaurna language of the original inhabitants, as part of the Adelaide City Council&#x27;s dual naming initiative.

The square has been upgraded and modified several times through its lifetime. It has become a tradition that during the Christmas period a tall Christmas tree is erected in the northern part of the square.

==Dual naming and significance==
The square was first named &quot;Victoria Square&quot; on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee, in honour of the then Princess Victoria.

In line with the Adelaide City Council&#x27;s recognition of Kaurna country, the square was officially referred to as Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga from 2002, modified to Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga by 2013, when Stage 1 of a major upgrade was done.

The name &quot;Tarndanya&quot;, sometimes recorded as &quot;Dharnda anya&quot; (or variant spelling) by colonial sources, means &quot;red kangaroo rock&quot; and was reportedly the name used by the Kaurna people for &quot;the site of South Adelaide&quot; or the central-South Adelaide area; the local people whose central camp had been &quot;in or near Victoria Square&quot; were called the &quot;Dundagunya tribe&quot; by colonial sources. Tarndanyangga/Tarntanyangga is derived from the Kaurna word for &quot;red kangaroo&quot; – &quot;tarnta&quot; (&quot;tarnda&quot;) – and that for &quot;rock&quot; – &quot;kanya&quot;. The ending &quot;-ngga&quot; means it is a location, implying &quot;in, at or on&quot;, which is often used in Kaurna place names. Many quarries were built on the southern bank of the Torrens, and &quot;Tarnta Kanya&quot; probably referred to one or more rock formations which were quarried, providing much of the stone for the large early buildings on North Terrace.

Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga is still considered an important meeting place for Aboriginal Australians. It is the focus for many political and community-based Indigenous events, such as the National Sorry Day commemoration held by Journey of Healing (SA) on 26 May each year. Each year during NAIDOC Week in July, there is a &quot;family fun day&quot; held at the square and a march to Parliament House.

The Australian Aboriginal flag was flown at Victoria Square for the first time in the country at a land rights rally in Victoria Square in Adelaide on 9 July 1971. On 8 July 2002 the Adelaide City Council endorsed the permanent flying of the flag, which now flies adjacent to the Australian flag.

==Description==
Victoria Square is in the centre of the city&#x27;s grid plan, designed by William Light. It is bordered by numerous public institutions at its north and south ends, including the Supreme Court of South Australia, the Adelaide Magistrates&#x27; Court, the Federal Court of Australia, the historic old Treasury building (now a hotel run by the Adina hotel chain) and the former Adelaide General Post Office.

On the eastern side is the Roman Catholic Cathedral Church of St Francis Xavier, the SA Water headquarters, State Government offices, including the office of the Premier, and the Torrens Building, which houses the Carnegie Mellon University.

The west side of the square contains more commercially oriented buildings, including an entrance to the Adelaide Central Market, the Hilton hotel, and the offices of various consultants, law firms and insurance companies.

King William Street passes through the centre of the square from north to south, creating a diamond shape, with the southbound carriageway passing through the east side, and the northbound carriageway passing through the west side of the square. The square is bisected on its east–west axis by the section of road (technically part of the square) that connects Wakefield Street (entering from the east) with Grote Street (to the west).
A tram stop (formerly the terminus) for the Glenelg tram line is just south of the Queen Victoria statue; it was shifted from the centre to the western edge of the square in 2007, as part of the extension that was made to the tram line around that time.

==History==

The link between the Aboriginal people and the square, as a centre for the surrounding area, stretches back many centuries, to a time when Tarndanya (Red Kangaroo Dreaming) people gathered there for special ceremonies and dances. Tarndanyangga was the &quot;headquarters&quot; or central camp of the &quot;Dundagunya tribe&quot;, a community numbering in the thousands. During the 1960s the Aboriginal community renewed its activities in Victoria Square, with the area in front of what was then the central Police Station, (and is now the Commonwealth Law Courts building), becoming a social and gathering point.

===19th century===

In 1837, the first Surveyor General of South Australia, Colonel William Light, mapped a plan for the City of Adelaide. The design incorporated a central square to function as Adelaide&#x27;s focal point and provide open space for recreational activities. On his first map, Light called the precinct &quot;The Great Square&quot;. It was eventually named in honour of Princess Victoria, then heir to the British throne.

The square was a dusty, treeless paddock until 1854, when the Adelaide City Council embarked on a planting program, constructed four broad diagonal pedestrian paths and erected a wooden fence. The landscaping work was designed by George William Francis, later the first director of the Adelaide Botanic Garden.

Other work on the square included construction of an east–west roadway that created two garden areas. A fountain was also considered, but it took a further 100 years for this idea to come to fruition. By 1883, plans were under way to extend King William Street directly through Victoria Square, dividing it into four garden areas. The original wooden fence was replaced by ornate iron railings. A statue of Queen Victoria – who had ascended to the throne in June 1837 – was erected in the centre of the square in 1894.

===20th century===

The statue of Colonel Light, now known as Light&#x27;s Vision and since 1938 situated on Montefiore Hill, was unveiled on 27 November 1906 in its original location at the northern end of Victoria Square.

The original tram terminus was located outside the Charles Moore &amp; Company department store with services operating via a loop in an anti-clockwise direction in the south-western corner. As part of the rebuilding of the square, in December 1966 the tram terminus was relocated near the centre of the square with Grote and Wakefield Streets to the north and Gouger and Angas Streets to the south.

The layout remained unchanged until 1967 when the square assumed its present diamond form. The Three Rivers Fountain by John Dowie was built to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, in 1968. The three South Australian rivers, the Murray, Onkaparinga and Torrens, are represented by an Aboriginal male with an Ibis, a female with a heron, and a female with a black swan. On 12 July 1971, the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag designed by Harold Thomas was flown for the first time – in Victoria Square. It now flies permanently alongside the Australian flag on one of the two tall flagpoles in the centre of the square.

===21st century===
In 2002, the Adelaide City Council formally recognised the areas heritage by bestowing the dual name Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga. The old tram depot at the square was also demolished, so was the old SAPOL Headquarters. An SA Water office building was built in its place. In 2012 the Adelaide City Council endorsed $24 million in funding to begin rejuvenating Victoria Square. Construction commenced in March 2013 and the first of two planned stages (the northern half) was completed in February 2014. The planned redevelopment of the southern half has been held up due to lack of funding. The full development included:
==Features==
=== Statue of Queen Victoria ===
Located in the centre of the square is a statue honouring Queen Victoria from a model by C. B. Birch, unveiled in 1894. The statue was presented to the city by Sir Edwin Smith, based on a design viewed in England in 1893. It was cast by Moore &amp; Co. of Thames Ditton using bronze specifically made from Wallaroo and Moonta copper. Inscribed simply with &quot;Victoria R.I.&quot;, the statue was originally unveiled by Lady Smith on 11 August 1894. The statue was symbolically draped in black as a sign of mourning following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. For many years a wreath laying ceremony was held at the foot of the statue each 24 May (or 23rd when the 24th was a Saturday), the anniversary of her birth in 1819. It was removed, cleaned and polished in May 2013 as part of the upgrade of Victoria Square and returned in December 2013 in a modified location.

=== Three Rivers Fountain ===
The Three Rivers Fountain was erected to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Adelaide in February 1963. Located at the northern end of the square, it was unveiled and first set in operation by the Duke of Edinburgh on 28 May 1968. It was later relocated to the southern end, and was officially reopened by then Lord Mayor, Stephen Yarwood, in July 2014.

Sculptured by John Dowie, the centrepiece in the shape of a crown represents the royal visit, and the fountain represents the three rivers that Adelaide draws water from:
* The Murray, depicted by an Aboriginal man and an ibis (probably representing Kaurna ancestor creator Tjilbruke)
* The Torrens, depicted by a woman and a black swan
* The Onkaparinga, depicted by a woman and a heron

The fountain was heritage-listed as a state heritage place in 2012.

=== The State Survey Mark ===
Located at the northern end of the square, the State Survey Mark commemorates the placing of the first peg for the survey of the City of Adelaide by Colonel Light on 11 January 1837. This survey mark is the reference point for all other survey marks in South Australia. The mark was unveiled on 21 April 1989, along with a commemorative plaque, by Susan Lenehan, then Minister of Lands.

=== Reconciliation Plaza ===
The east–west road connecting Grote and Wakefield Streets was named Reconciliation Plaza in 2013. The plaza hosts two flagpoles flying the Australian National Flag and the Aboriginal flag, which has flown permanently in the square since 2002. In 1971, the square was the first place the Aboriginal flag was flown, at a land rights rally (see Dual naming, above).

Reconciliation Plaza was officially opened on 26 May 2014 by Mayor Yarwood, Reconciliation Committee Chairperson Yvonne Agius and Journey of Healing SA Chairperson John Browne.

=== Statue of John McDouall Stuart ===

A monument to John McDouall Stuart, one of Australia&#x27;s premier explorers, is situated in Victoria Square and was heritage listed on 8 March 2013. Sculpted by John White, it was unveiled on 4 June 1904 by Alexander McLachlan, who as chief of the South Australian Caledonian Society led fundraising efforts for its erection. Stuart led the first expedition to successfully cross the continent from north to south and back. This opened Central Australia for pastoral use and led to the South Australian government&#x27;s successful case for control over the Northern Territory. The route of his expedition also paved the way for the Overland Telegraph, which permitted virtually immediate communication between Australia and Europe.

=== Statue of Charles Sturt ===
A statue of explorer Charles Sturt stands in Victoria Square. Sturt is depicted in the working clothes of an outback explorer, leaning forward, shielding his eyes from the sun with his right hand and peering into the distance. He carries a compass, telescope, map and water bottle.

===Statue of Charles Kingston===

A statue of Charles Kingston, son of George Strickland Kingston and SA premier from 1893 to 1899, stands in the square with a plaque reading &quot;patriot and statesman&quot;. British sculptor Alfred Drury was commissioned to create the statue, and it was placed in a central location on the northwestern side, facing down Grote Street towards his West Adelaide electorate. It was unveiled on 26 May 1916, during World War I. It was later criticised as capturing &quot;little of his fire&quot;. While Kingston was instrumental in bringing about several progressive social policies, such as electoral reform (including the first law to give votes to women in Australia), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration act in Australia, and a progressive system of taxation, he was also one of the main architects of the White Australia policy. After the Black Lives Matter gained pace in June 2020, with various statues representing slave traders and various perpetrators of racism being removed or defaced both in the US and in the UK during the George Floyd protests, archaeologist and historian Jacinta Koolmatrie argued it is ironic that the statue is placed so close to the Aboriginal flag in the square, which was also the site of the Adelaide Black Lives Matter protest.

==Tram stop==

Victoria Square is also the location of a stop on the Glenelg tram line.

<text>Bidhan Chandra Roy (1 July 1882 – 1 July 1962) was an Indian physician and politician who served as Chief Minister of West Bengal from 1950 until his death in 1962. He played a key role in the founding of several institutions and cities like Salt Lake (now a part of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation), Kalyani, and Durgapur. 

In India, the National Doctors&#x27; Day is celebrated in his memory every year on 1 July. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour in 1961.

==Early life and education==

Bidhan Chandra Roy was born on 1 July 1882 to a Bengali Kayastha family in Bankipore in Patna, where his father, Prakash Chandra Roy coming from a wealthy family of Satkhira, Khulna district, Bengal Presidency (now in Bangladesh), was serving as an excise inspector. His mother, Aghorkamini Devi, was religious and a devoted social worker. Roy was the youngest of five siblings, with 2 sisters (Susharbashini and Sarojini) and 2 brothers(Subodh and Sadhan). His parents were ardent Brahmo Samajists.

Prakash Chandra was a descendant of the family of Maharaja Pradapaditya, the rebel Hindu king of Jessore, but did not inherit much wealth from his ancestors. He earned a moderate salary for most part of Roy&#x27;s childhood, but he and Aghorkamini supported the education and upbringing of both their own children and a number of other poor children, mostly orphans.

Roy left Patna in June 1901 to study at the Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata. While at medical school, he came upon an inscription which read, &quot;Whatever thy hands findeth to do, do it with thy might.&quot; These words became a lifelong source of inspiration for him.

Intending to enroll at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital to complete further studies in medicine, Roy left for Britain in February 1909 with 1,200. The then dean of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital was reluctant to accept an Asian student and rejected his application. Roy submitted several additional applications until the dean, after 30 admission requests, admitted him.

==Career==

Upon returning to India, Roy joined the Provincial Health Service. In addition to a private practice, he served as a nurse when necessary. He taught at the Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata and later at the Campbell Medical School (now NRS Medical College) and the Carmichael Medical College (now R. G. Kar Medical College). He served as the first president of Cardiological Society of India from 1948 to 1950.

Roy believed that swaraj (the call to action for India&#x27;s freedom) would remain a dream unless the people were healthy and strong in mind and body. He made contributions to the organisation of medical education. He played an important role in the establishment of the Jadavpur T.B. Hospital, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital, Victoria Institution (college), and Chittaranjan Cancer Hospital. In 1926, the Chittaranjan Seva Sadan for women and children was opened by Roy.

Roy was also Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s personal doctor and friend.

In 1925, Roy ran for elections from the Barrackpore constituency as an independent candidate for the Bengal Legislative Council and defeated the &quot;Grand Old Man of Bengal&quot;, Surendranath Banerjee. Though an independent, he voted with the Swaraj Party (the Parliamentary wing of the Congress party in the 1920s). As early as 1925, Roy tabled a resolution recommending a study of the causes of pollution in Hooghly and suggested measures to prevent pollution in the future.

Roy was elected to the All India Congress Committee in 1928. Roy conducted Civil Disobedience in Bengal in 1929 and prompted Pandit Motilal Nehru to nominate him as a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) in 1930. The CWC was declared an unlawful assembly and Roy along with other members of the committee were arrested on 26 August 1930 and detained at Alipore Central Jail.

During the Dandi March in 1931, many members of the Calcutta Corporation were imprisoned. Congress requested Roy to remain out of prison and discharge the duties of the Corporation. He served as the Alderman of the Corporation from 1930 to 1931 and as the Mayor of Calcutta from 1931 to 1933. Under him, the Corporation expanded schemes for free education, free medical aid, improved roads and lighting, and water supply. He set up a framework for dispensing grant-in-aid to hospitals and charitable dispensaries.

In 1942, Rangoon fell to the Japanese bombing and caused an exodus from Calcutta fearing a Japanese invasion. Roy, then serving as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta, acquired air-raid shelters for schools and college students to have their classes in, and provided relief for students, teachers and employees alike.

==Chief Minister of West Bengal==
The Congress Party proposed Roy&#x27;s name for Premier of West Bengal. Although Roy sought to continue with his profession, he accepted the position and took office on 23 January 1948 upon Gandhi&#x27;s advice. Bengal at the time had been torn by communal violence, shortage of food, unemployment and a large flow of refugees in the wake of the creation of East Pakistan. In an address to the people of West Bengal, Roy said:

On 26 January 1950, Roy took oath as the first Chief Minister of West Bengal in Independent India. Under his leadership, the Congress party won the legislative assembly elections in West Bengal in 1952 and 1957.

The 22-member Sarkar Committee, headed by industrialist Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, recommended the formation of technical institutions for higher education in India. Roy successfully petitioned then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to setup the first institute in West Bengal, on the grounds that the state had the highest concentration of industries at that time. The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur was thus established in May 1950, with Roy serving as the first Chairman of the Board of Governors.

He was credited for the development of cities like Bidhannagar, Kalyani, and Durgapur, which were crucial for the growth of West Bengal&#x27;s economy at a time when it was ravaged by the ill consequences of partition.

==Death==
Bidhan Chandra Roy died on 1 July 1962, coincidentally on his 80th birthday. His house was later converted into a nursing home named after his mother, Aghorkamini Devi. He had also constituted a trust for his properties at Patna to carry out social service, with eminent nationalist Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha) being its first trustee.

==Legacy==


The Indian Government honoured Roy with the Bharat Ratna on 4 February 1961.

The B.C. Roy National Award was instituted in 1962 in his memory and has been awarded annually since 1976. The award recognizes excellent contributions in the areas of medicine, politics, science, philosophy, literature and arts. The Dr. B. C. Roy Memorial Library and Reading Room for Children in the Children&#x27;s Book Trust, New Delhi, was opened in 1967. Today, his private papers are part of the Archives at the Nehru Memorial Museum &amp; Library, at Teen Murti House, Delhi.

India celebrates National Doctors&#x27; Day on July 1 every year to honour his birth and death anniversary.

<doc id="1196185" wikidata="Q7239989" url="?curid=1196185" title="Pre-intuitionism">
<text>In the philosophy of mathematics, the pre-intuitionists is the name given by L. E. J. Brouwer to several influential mathematicians who shared similar opinions on the nature of mathematics. The term was introduced by Brouwer in his 1951 lectures at Cambridge where he described the differences between his philosophy of intuitionism and its predecessors:
Of a totally different orientation [from the &quot;Old Formalist School&quot; of Dedekind, Cantor, Peano, Zermelo, and Couturat, etc.] was the Pre-Intuitionist School, mainly led by Poincaré, Borel and Lebesgue. These thinkers seem to have maintained a modified observational standpoint for the introduction of natural numbers, for the principle of complete induction [...] For these, even for such theorems as were deduced by means of classical logic, they postulated an existence and exactness independent of language and logic and regarded its non-contradictority as certain, even without logical proof. For the continuum, however, they seem not to have sought an origin strictly extraneous to language and logic.

==The introduction of natural numbers==

The pre-intuitionists, as defined by L. E. J. Brouwer, differed from the formalist standpoint in several ways, particularly in regard to the introduction of natural numbers, or how the natural numbers are defined/denoted. For Poincaré, the definition of a mathematical entity is the construction of the entity itself and not an expression of an underlying essence or existence.

This is to say that no mathematical object exists without human construction of it, both in mind and language.

==The principle of complete induction==
This sense of definition allowed Poincaré to argue with Bertrand Russell over Giuseppe Peano&#x27;s axiomatic theory of natural numbers.

Peano&#x27;s fifth axiom states: 
*Allow that; zero has a property &quot;P&quot;; 
*And; if every natural number less than a number &quot;x&quot; has the property &quot;P&quot; then &quot;x&quot; also has the property &quot;P&quot;. 
*Therefore; every natural number has the property &quot;P&quot;.

This is the principle of complete induction, which establishes the property of induction as necessary to the system. Since Peano&#x27;s axiom is as infinite as the natural numbers, it is difficult to prove that the property of &quot;P&quot; does belong to any &quot;x&quot; and also &quot;x&quot; + 1. What one can do is say that, if after some number &quot;n&quot; of trials that show a property &quot;P&quot; conserved in &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; + 1, then we may infer that it will still hold to be true after &quot;n&quot; + 1 trials. But this is itself induction. And hence the argument begs the question.

From this Poincaré argues that if we fail to establish the consistency of Peano&#x27;s axioms for natural numbers without falling into circularity, then the principle of complete induction is not provable by general logic.

Thus arithmetic and mathematics in general is not analytic but synthetic. Logicism thus rebuked and Intuition is held up. What Poincaré and the Pre-Intuitionists shared was the perception of a difference between logic and mathematics that is not a matter of language alone, but of knowledge itself.

==Arguments over the excluded middle==
It was for this assertion, among others, that Poincaré was considered to be similar to the intuitionists. For Brouwer though, the Pre-Intuitionists failed to go as far as necessary in divesting mathematics from metaphysics, for they still used &quot;principium tertii exclusi&quot; (the &quot;law of excluded middle&quot;).

The principle of the excluded middle does lead to some strange situations. For instance, statements about the future such as &quot;There will be a naval battle tomorrow&quot; do not seem to be either true or false, &quot;yet&quot;. So there is some question whether statements must be either true or false in some situations. To an intuitionist this seems to rank the law of excluded middle as just as unrigorous as Peano&#x27;s vicious circle.

Yet to the Pre-Intuitionists this is mixing apples and oranges. For them mathematics was one thing (a muddled invention of the human mind, &quot;i.e.&quot;, synthetic), and logic was another (analytic).

==Other pre-intuitionists==
The above examples only include the works of Poincaré, and yet Brouwer named other mathematicians as Pre-Intuitionists too; Borel and Lebesgue. Other mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl (who eventually became disenchanted with intuitionism, feeling that it places excessive strictures on mathematical progress) and Leopold Kronecker also played a role—though they are not cited by Brouwer in his definitive speech.

In fact Kronecker might be the most famous of the Pre-Intuitionists for his singular and oft quoted phrase, &quot;God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man.&quot;

Kronecker goes in almost the opposite direction from Poincaré, believing in the natural numbers but not the law of the excluded middle. He was the first mathematician to express doubt on non-constructive existence proofs that state that something must exist because it can be shown that it is &quot;impossible&quot; for it not to.

<doc id="1196186" wikidata="Q2557782" url="?curid=1196186" title="Superhard material">
<text>A superhard material is a material with a hardness value exceeding 40 gigapascals (GPa) when measured by the Vickers hardness test. They are virtually incompressible solids with high electron density and high bond covalency. As a result of their unique properties, these materials are of great interest in many industrial areas including, but not limited to, abrasives, polishing and cutting tools, disc brakes, and wear-resistant and protective coatings.

Diamond is the hardest known material to date, with a Vickers hardness in the range of 70–150 GPa. Diamond demonstrates both high thermal conductivity and electrically insulating properties, and much attention has been put into finding practical applications of this material. However, diamond has several limitations for mass industrial application, including its high cost and oxidation at temperatures above 800 °C. In addition, diamond dissolves in iron and forms iron carbides at high temperatures and therefore is inefficient in cutting ferrous materials including steel. Therefore, recent research of superhard materials has been focusing on compounds which would be thermally and chemically more stable than pure diamond.

The search for new superhard materials has generally taken two paths. In the first approach, researchers emulate the short, directional covalent carbon bonds of diamond by combining light elements like boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This approach became popular in the late 1980s with the exploration of C3N4 and B-C-N ternary compounds. The second approach towards designing superhard materials incorporates these lighter elements (B, C, N, and O), but also introduces transition metals with high valence electron densities to provide high incompressibility. In this way, metals with high bulk moduli but low hardness are coordinated with small covalent-forming atoms to produce superhard materials. Tungsten carbide is an industrially-relevant manifestation of this approach, although it is not considered superhard. Alternatively, borides combined with transition metals have become a rich area of superhard research and have led to discoveries such as ReB2, OsB2, and WB4.

Superhard materials can be generally classified into two categories: intrinsic compounds and extrinsic compounds. The intrinsic group includes diamond, cubic boron nitride (c-BN), carbon nitrides, and ternary compounds such as B-N-C, which possess an innate hardness. Conversely, extrinsic materials are those that have superhardness and other mechanical properties that are determined by their microstructure rather than composition. An example of extrinsic superhard material is nanocrystalline diamond known as aggregated diamond nanorods.

==Definition and mechanics of hardness==
The hardness of a material is directly related to its incompressibility, elasticity and resistance to change in shape. A superhard material has high shear modulus, high bulk modulus, and does not deform plastically. Ideally superhard materials should have a defect-free, isotropic lattice. This greatly reduces structural deformations that can lower the strength of the material. However, defects can actually strengthen some covalent structures. Traditionally, high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions have been used to synthesize superhard materials, but recent superhard material syntheses aim at using less energy and lower cost materials.

Historically, hardness was first defined as the ability of one material to scratch another and quantified by an integer (sometimes half-integer) from 0 to 10 on the Mohs scale. This scale was however quickly found too discrete and non-linear. Measuring the mechanical hardness of materials changed to using a nanoindenter (usually made of diamond) and evaluating bulk moduli, and the Brinell, Rockwell, Knoop, and Vickers scales have been developed. Whereas the Vickers scale is widely accepted as a most common test, there remain controversies on the weight load to be applied during the test. This is because Vickers hardness values are load-dependent. An indent made with 0.5N will indicate a higher hardness value than an indent made with 50N. This phenomenon is known as the indentation size effect (ISE). Thus, hardness values are not meaningful unless the load is also reported. Some argue that hardness values should consistently be reported in the asymptotic (high-load region), as this is a more standardized representation of a material&#x27;s hardness.

Bulk moduli, shear moduli, and elasticity are the key factors in the superhard classification process. The incompressibility of a material is quantified by the bulk modulus B, which measures the resistance of a solid to volume compression under hydrostatic stress as B = −Vdp/dV. Here V is the volume, p is pressure, and dp/dV is the partial derivative of pressure with respect to the volume. The bulk modulus test uses an indenter tool to form a permanent deformation in a material. The size of the deformation depends on the material&#x27;s resistance to the volume compression made by the tool. Elements with small molar volumes and strong interatomic forces usually have high bulk moduli. Bulk moduli was the first major test of hardness and originally shown to be correlated with the molar volume (Vm) and cohesive energy (Ec) as B ~ Ec/Vm. 

Bulk modulus was believed to be a direct measure of a material&#x27;s hardness but this no longer remains the dominant school of thought. For example, some alkali and noble metals (Pd, Ag) have anomalously high ratio of the bulk modulus to the Vickers or Brinell hardness. In the early 2000s, a direct relationship between bulk modulus and valence electron density was found as the more electrons were present the greater the repulsions within the structure were. Bulk modulus is still used as a preliminary measure of a material as superhard but it is now known that other properties must be taken into account.

In contrast to bulk modulus, shear modulus measures the resistance to shape change at a constant volume, taking into account the crystalline plane and direction of shear. The shear modulus G is defined as ratio of shear stress to shear strain: G = stress/strain = F·L/(A·dx), where F is the applied force, A is the area upon which the force acts, dx is the resulting displacement and L is the initial length. The larger the shear modulus, the greater the ability for a material to resist shearing forces. Therefore, the shear modulus is a measure of rigidity. Shear modulus is related to bulk modulus as , where v is the Poisson&#x27;s ratio, which is typically ~0.1 in covalent materials. If a material contains highly directional bonds, the shear modulus will increase and give a low Poisson ratio.

A material is also considered hard if it resists plastic deformation. If a material has short covalent bonds, atomic dislocations that lead to plastic deformation are less likely to occur than in materials with longer, delocalized bonds. If a material contains many delocalized bonds it is likely to be soft. Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property fracture toughness, which is a material&#x27;s ability to resist breakage from forceful impact (note that this concept is distinct from the notion of toughness). A superhard material is not necessarily &quot;supertough&quot;. For example, the fracture toughness of diamond is about 7–10 MPa·m1/2, which is high compared to other gemstones and ceramic materials, but poor compared to many metals and alloys – common steels and aluminium alloys have the toughness values at least 5 times higher.

Several properties must be taken into account when evaluating a material as (super)hard. While hard materials have high bulk moduli, a high bulk modulus does not mean a material is hard. Inelastic characteristics must be considered as well, and shear modulus might even provide a better correlation with hardness than bulk modulus. Covalent materials generally have high bond-bending force constants and high shear moduli and are more likely to give superhard structures than, for example, ionic solids.

==Diamond==

Diamond is an allotrope of carbon where the atoms are arranged in a modified version of face-centered cubic (&quot;fcc&quot;) structure known as &quot;diamond cubic&quot;. It is known for its hardness (see table above) and incompressibility and is targeted for some potential optical and electrical applications. The properties of individual natural diamonds or carbonado vary too widely for industrial purposes, and therefore synthetic diamond became a major research focus.

===Synthetic diamond===
The high-pressure synthesis of diamond in 1953 in Sweden and in 1954 in the US, made possible by the development of new apparatus and techniques, became a milestone in synthesis of artificial superhard materials. The synthesis clearly showed the potential of high-pressure applications for industrial purposes and stimulated growing interest in the field. Four years after the first synthesis of artificial diamond, cubic boron nitride c-BN was obtained and found to be the second hardest solid.

Synthetic diamond can exist as a single, continuous crystal or as small polycrystals interconnected through the grain boundaries. The inherent spatial separation of these subunits causes the formation of grains, which are visible by the unaided eye due to the light absorption and scattering properties of the material.

The hardness of synthetic diamond (70–150 GPa) is very dependent on the relative purity of the crystal itself. The more perfect the crystal structure, the harder the diamond becomes. It has been reported that HPHT single crystals and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates (aggregated diamond nanorods) can be harder than natural diamond.

Historically, it was thought that synthetic diamond should be structurally perfect to be useful. This is because diamond was mainly preferred for its aesthetic qualities, and small flaws in structure and composition were visible by naked eye. Although this is true, the properties associated with these small changes has led to interesting new potential applications of synthetic diamond. For example, nitrogen doping can enhance mechanical strength of diamond, and heavy doping with boron (several atomic percent) makes it a superconductor.

In 2014, researchers reported on the synthesis of nano-twinned diamond with Vickers hardness values up to 200 GPa. The authors attribute the unprecedented hardness to the Hall-Petch effect, which predicts that smaller microstructural features can lead to enhanced hardness due to higher density of boundaries that stop dislocations. They achieve twins with an average thickness of 5 nm using a precursor of onion carbon nanoparticles subjected to high temperature and pressure. They also simultaneously achieve an oxidation temperature that is 200 °C higher than that of natural diamond. Higher thermal stability is relevant to industrial applications such as cutting tools, where high temperatures can lead to rapid diamond degradation.

===Dense Amorphous Carbon===
A dense AM-III form of transparent amorphous carbon has a Vickers hardness of 113 GPa. This heat-treated fullerene is currently the hardest amorphous material.

==Cubic boron nitride==

===History===
Cubic boron nitride or c-BN was first synthesized in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf at General Electric, shortly after the synthesis of diamond. The general process for c-BN synthesis is the dissolution of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in a solvent-catalyst, usually alkali or alkaline earth metals or their nitrides, followed by spontaneous nucleation of c-BN under high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) conditions. The yield of c-BN is lower and substantially slower compared to diamond&#x27;s synthetic route due to the complicated intermediate steps. Its insolubility in iron and other metal alloys makes it more useful for some industrial applications than diamond.
Pure cubic boron nitride is transparent or slightly amber. Different colors can be produced depending on defects or an excess of boron (less than 1%). Defects can be produced by doping solvent-catalysts (i.e. Li, Ca, or Mg nitrides) with Al, B, Ti, or Si. This induces a change in the morphology and color of c-BN crystals.
The result is darker and larger (500 μm) crystals with better shapes and a higher yield.

===Structure and properties===
Cubic boron nitride adopts a sphalerite crystal structure, which can be constructed by replacing every two carbon atoms in diamond with one boron atom and one nitrogen atom. The short B-N (1.57 Å) bond is close to the diamond C-C bond length (1.54 Å), that results in strong covalent bonding between atoms in the same fashion as in diamond. The slight decrease in covalency for B-N bonds compared to C-C bonds reduces the hardness from ~100 GPa for diamond down to 48 GPa in c-BN. As diamond is less stable than graphite, c-BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature.

Cubic boron nitride is insoluble in iron, nickel, and related alloys at high temperatures, but it binds well with metals due to formation of interlayers of metal borides and nitrides. It is also insoluble in most acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH/Na2CO3, NaNO3 which are used to etch c-BN. Because of its stability with heat and metals, c-BN surpasses diamond in mechanical applications. The thermal conductivity of BN is among the highest of all electric insulators. In addition, c-BN consists of only light elements and has low X-ray absorptivity, capable of reducing the X-ray absorption background.

===Research and development===
Due to its great chemical and mechanical robustness, c-BN has widespread application as an abrasive, such as on cutting tools and scratch resistant surfaces. Cubic boron nitride is also highly transparent to X-rays. This, along with its high strength, makes it possible to have very thin coatings of c-BN on structures that can be inspected using X-rays. Several hundred tonnes of c-BN are produced worldwide each year. By modification, Borazon, a US brand name of c-BN, is used in industrial applications to shape tools, as it can withstand temperatures greater than 2,000 °C. Cubic boron nitride-coated grinding wheels, referred to as Borazon wheels, are routinely used in the machining of hard ferrous metals, cast irons, and nickel-base and cobalt-base superalloys. Other brand names, such as Elbor and Cubonite, are marketed by Russian vendors.

New approaches in research focus on improving c-BN pressure capabilities of the devices used for c-BN synthesis. At present, the capabilities for the production of c-BN are restricted to pressures of about 6 GPa. Increasing the pressure limit will permit synthesis of larger single crystals than from the present catalytic synthesis. However, the use of solvents under supercritical conditions for c-BN synthesis has been shown to reduce pressure requirements. The high cost of c-BN still limits its application, which motivates the search for other superhard materials.

==Carbon nitride==
The structure of beta carbon nitride (β-C3N4) was first proposed by Amy Liu and Marvin Cohen in 1989. It is isostructural with Si3N4 and was predicted to be harder than diamond. The calculated bond length was 1.47 Å, 5% shorter than the C-C bond length in diamond. Later calculations indicated that the shear modulus is 60% of that of diamond, and carbon nitride is less hard than c-BN.

Despite two decades of pursuit of this compound, no synthetic sample of C3N4 has validated the hardness predictions; this has been attributed to the difficulty in synthesis and the instability of C3N4. Carbon nitride is only stable at a pressure that is higher than that of the graphite-to-diamond transformation. The synthesis conditions would require extremely high pressures because carbon is four- and sixfold coordinated. In addition, C3N4 would pose problems of carbide formation if they were to be used to machine ferrous metals. Although publications have reported preparation of C3N4 at lower pressures than stated, synthetic C3N4 was not proved superhard.

==Boron carbon nitride==
The similar atomic sizes of boron, carbon and nitrogen, as well as the similar structures of carbon and boron nitride polymorphs, suggest that it might be possible to synthesize diamond-like phase containing all three elements. It is also possible to make compounds containing B-C-O, B-O-N, or B-C-O-N under high pressure, but their synthesis would expect to require a complex chemistry and in addition, their elastic properties would be inferior to that of diamond.

Beginning in 1990, a great interest has been put in studying the possibility to synthesize dense B-C-N phases. They are expected to be thermally and chemically more stable than diamond, and harder than c-BN, and would therefore be excellent materials for high speed cutting and polishing of ferrous alloys. These characteristic properties are attributed to the diamond-like structure combined with the sp3 σ-bonds among carbon and the heteroatoms. BCxNy thin films were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition in 1972. However, data on the attempted synthesis of B-C-N dense phases reported by different authors have been contradictory. It is unclear whether the synthesis products are diamond-like solid solutions between carbon and boron nitride or just mechanical mixtures of highly dispersed diamond and c-BN. In 2001, a diamond-like-structured c-BC2N was synthesized at pressures &gt;18 GPa and temperatures &gt;2,200 K by a direct solid-state phase transition of graphite-like (BN)0.48C0.52. The reported Vickers and Knoop hardnesses were intermediate between diamond and c-BN, making the new phase the second hardest known material. Ternary B–C–N phases can also be made using shock-compression synthesis. It was further suggested to extend the B–C–N system to quaternary compounds with silicon included.

==Metal borides==
Unlike carbon-based systems, metal borides can be easily synthesized in large quantities under ambient conditions, an important technological advantage. Most metal borides are hard; however, a few stand out among them for their particularly high hardnesses (for example, WB4, RuB2, OsB2 and ReB2). 
These metal borides are still metals and not semiconductors or insulators (as indicated by their high electronic density of states at the Fermi Level); however, the additional covalent B-B and M-B bonding (M = metal) lead to high hardness. Dense heavy metals, such as osmium, rhenium, tungsten etc., are particularly apt at forming hard borides because of their high electron densities, small atomic radii, high bulk moduli, and ability to bond strongly with boron.

===Osmium diboride===

Osmium diboride (OsB2) has a high bulk modulus of 395 GPa and therefore is considered as a candidate superhard material, but the maximum achieved Vickers hardness is 37 GPa, slightly below the 40 GPa limit of superhardness. A common way to synthesize OsB2 is by a solid-state metathesis reaction containing a 2:3 mixture of OsCl3:MgB2. After the MgCl2 product is washed away, X-ray diffraction indicates products of OsB2, OsB and Os. Heating this product at 1,000 °C for three days produces pure OsB2 crystalline product. OsB2 has an orthorhombic structure (space group P&quot;mmn&quot;) with two planes of osmium atoms separated by a non-planar layer of hexagonally coordinated boron atoms; the lattice parameters are &quot;a&quot; = 4.684 Å, &quot;b&quot; = 2.872 Å and &quot;c&quot; = 4.096 Å. The &quot;b&quot; direction of the crystal is the most compressible and the &quot;c&quot; direction is the least compressible. This can be explained by the orthorhombic structure. When looking at the boron and osmium atoms in the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; directions, they are arranged in a way that is offset from one another. Therefore, when they are compressed they are not pushed right up against one another. Electrostatic repulsion is the force that maximizes the materials incompressibility and so in this case the electrostatic repulsion is not taken full advantage of. When compressed in the &quot;c&quot; direction, the osmium and boron atoms are almost directly in line with one another and the electrostatic repulsion is therefore high, causing direction &quot;c&quot; to be the least compressible. This model implies that if boron is more evenly distributed throughout the lattice then incompressibility could be higher. Electron backscatter diffraction coupled with hardness measurements reveals that in the (010) plane, the crystal is 54% harder in the &lt;100&gt; than &lt;001&gt; direction. This is seen by looking at how long the indentation is along a certain direction (related to the indentations made with a Vickers hardness test). Along with the alignment of the atoms, this is also due to the short covalent B-B (1.80 Å) bonds in the &lt;100&gt; direction, which are absent in the &lt;001&gt; direction (B-B = 4.10 Å).

===Rhenium borides===
Rhenium was targeted as a candidate for superhard metal borides because of its desirable physical and chemical characteristics. It has a high electron density, a small atomic radius and a high bulk modulus. When combined with boron, it makes a crystal with highly covalent bonding allowing it to be incompressible and potentially very hard. A wide array of rhenium borides have been investigated including Re3B, Re7B3, Re2B, ReB, Re2B3, Re3B7, Re2B5, ReB3 and ReB2. Each of these materials has their own set of properties and characteristics. Some show promise as superconductors and some have unique elastic and electronic properties, but the most relevant to superhard materials is ReB2.

Rhenium diboride (ReB2) is a refractory compound which was first synthesized in the 1960s, using arc melting, zone melting, or optical floating zone furnaces. An example synthesis of this material is the flux method, which is conducted by placing rhenium metal and amorphous boron in an alumina crucible with excess aluminium. This can be run with a ratio of 1:2:50 for Re:B:Al, with the excess aluminium as a growth medium. The crucible is placed in an alumina tube, inserted into a resistively heated furnace with flowing argon gas and sintered at 1,400 °C for several hours. After cooling, the aluminium is dissolved in NaOH. Each ReB2 synthesis route has its own drawbacks, and this one gives small inclusions of aluminium incorporated into the crystal lattice.

Rhenium diboride has a very high melting point approaching 2,400 °C and a highly anisotropic, layered crystal structure. Its symmetry is either hexagonal (space group P63&quot;mc&quot;) or orthorhombic (C&quot;mcm&quot;) depending on the phase. There, close-packed Re layers alternate with puckered triangular boron layers along the (001) plane. This can be seen above on the example of osmium diboride. The density of states for ReB2 has one of the lowest values among the metal borides, indicating strong covalent bonding and high hardness.

Owing to the anisotropic nature of this material, the hardness depends on the crystal orientation. The (002) plane contains the most covalent character and exhibits a maximum Vickers hardness value of 40.5 GPa, while the perpendicular planes were 6% lower at 38.1 GPa. These values decrease with increased load, settling at around 28 GPa each. The nanoindentation values were found to be 36.4 GPa and 34.0 GPa for the (002) and perpendicular planes respectively. The hardness values depend on the material purity and composition – the more boron the harder the boride – and the above values are for a Re:B ratio of approximately 1.00:1.85. Rhenium diboride also has a reported bulk modulus of 383 GPa and a shear modulus of 273 GPa. The hardness of rhenium diboride, and most other materials also depends on the load during the test. The above values of about 40 GPa were all measured with an effective load of 0.5–1 N. At such low load, the hardness values are also overestimated for other materials, for example it exceeds 100 GPa for c-BN. Other researchers, while having reproduced the high ReB2 hardness at low load, reported much lower values of 19–17 GPa at a more conventional load of 3–49 N, that makes ReB2 a hard, but not a superhard material.

Rhenium diboride exhibits metallic conductivity which increases as temperature decreases and can be explained by a nonzero density of states due to the d and p overlap of rhenium and boron respectively. At this point, it is the only superhard material with metallic behavior. The material also exhibits relatively high thermal stability. Depending on the heating method, it will maintain its mass up to temperatures of 600–800 °C, with any drop being due to loss of absorbed water. A small loss of mass can then be seen at temperatures approaching 1,000 °C. It performs better when a slower heat ramp is utilized. Part of this small drop at around 1,000 °C was explained by the formation of a dull B2O3 coating on the surface as boron is leached out of the solid, which serves as a protective coating, thereby reducing additional boron loss. This can be easily dissolved by methanol to restore the material to it native shiny state.

=== Tungsten borides ===

The discovery of superhard tungsten tetraboride is further evidence for the promising design approach of covalently bonding incompressible transition metals with boron. While WB4 was first synthesized and identified as the highest boride of tungsten in 1966, it was only recognized as an inexpensive superhard material in 2011.

Interestingly, lower borides of tungsten such as tungsten diboride are not superhard. Higher boron content leads to higher hardness because of the increased density of short, covalent boron-boron and boron-metal bonds. However, researchers have been able to push WB2 into the superhard regime through minority additions of other transition metals such as niobium and tantalum in the crystal structure. This mechanism of hardness enhancement is called solid solution strengthening and arises because atoms of different sizes are incorporated into the parent lattice to impede dislocation motion.

===Aluminium magnesium boride===
Aluminium magnesium boride or BAM is a chemical compound of aluminium, magnesium and boron. Whereas its nominal formula is AlMgB14, the chemical composition is closer to Al0.75Mg0.75B14. It is a ceramic alloy that is highly resistive to wear and has a low coefficient of sliding friction.

==Other boron-rich superhard materials==
Other hard boron-rich compounds include B4C and B6O. Amorphous a-B4C has a hardness of about 50 GPa, which is in the range of superhardness. It can be looked at as consisting of boron icosahedra-like crystals embedded in an amorphous medium. However, when studying the crystalline form of B4C, the hardness is only about 30 GPa. This crystalline form has the same stoichiometry as B13C3, which consists of boron icosahedra connected by boron and carbon atoms. Boron suboxide (B6O) has a hardness of about 35 GPa. Its structure contains eight B12 icosahedra units, which are sitting at the vertices of a rhombohedral unit cell. There are two oxygen atoms located along the (111) rhombohedral direction.

==Nanostructured superhard materials==
Nanosuperhard materials fall into the extrinsic category of superhard materials. Because molecular defects affect the superhard properties of bulk materials it is obvious that the microstructure of superhard materials give the materials their unique properties. Focus on synthesizing nano superhard materials is around minimizing microcracks occurring within the structure through grain boundary hardening. The elimination of microcracks can strengthen the material by 3 to 7 times its original strength. Grain boundary strengthening is described by the Hall-Petch equation

:formula_1

Here σc is the critical fracture stress, d the crystallite size and σ0 and kgb are constants.

If a material is brittle its strength depends mainly on the resistance to forming microcracks. The critical stress which causes the growth of a microcrack of size a0 is given by a general formula

:formula_2

Here E is the Young&#x27;s modulus, kcrack is a constant dependent on the nature and shape of the microcrack and the stress applied and γs the surface cohesive energy.

The average hardness of a material decreases with d (crystallite size) decreasing below 10 nm. There have been many mechanisms proposed for grain boundary sliding and hence material softening, but the details are still not understood. Besides grain boundary strengthening, much attention has been put into building microheterostructures, or nanostructures of two materials with very large differences in elastic moduli. Heterostructures were first proposed in 1970 and contained such highly ordered thin layers that they could not theoretically be separated by mechanical means. These highly ordered heterostructures were believed to be stronger than simple mixtures. This theory was confirmed with Al/Cu and Al/Ag structures. After the formation of Al/Cu and Al/Ag, the research was extended to multilayer systems including Cu/Ni, TiN/VN, W/WN, Hf/HfN and more. In all cases, decreasing the lattice period increased the hardness. One common form of a nanostructured material is aggregated diamond nanorods, which is harder than bulk diamond and is currently the hardest (~150 GPa) material known.

<text>The Great Space Coaster is an American live-action/animated children&#x27;s television show that was broadcast in first-run syndication from 1981 to 1986.

==Plot==
&quot;The Great Space Coaster&quot; is about three young singers (Francine, Danny, and Roy) who are brought to a habitable asteroid in space called Coasterville by a clown named Baxter who pilots the &quot;space coaster&quot;, a roller coaster-like spaceship. The asteroid is populated by strange-looking, wise-cracking puppet characters such as Goriddle Gorilla, Knock Knock the Woodpecker, Edison the Elephant, and Gary Gnu (host of &quot;The Gary Gnu Show&quot;). Baxter is forever on the run from M.T. Promises, a nefarious ringmaster who plans to re-capture Baxter and return him to the circus he worked at before he escaped. Each episode ends with a different life lesson, and various celebrity guest stars (such as Mark Hamill of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fame and composer Marvin Hamlisch) occasionally dropped by.

==Production==
The series was co-created by Kermit Love (original Muppet designer and builder for Jim Henson) and Jim Martin (who later went to work on a number of Henson-related projects including &quot;Sesame Street&quot;). The series&#x27; episodes, which were videotaped in New York City, were directed by Dick Feldman and were fitted with a laugh track. It was produced by Sunbow Productions and distributed by Claster Television, a division of Hasbro. The puppets were designed by The Great Jones Studio, New York, under the supervision of Kermit Love. The puppet designers and builders consisted of Jim Kroupa, Robert Lovett, Christoper Lyall, John Orberg, and Matthew Stoddart.

==Format==
In each episode, Roy shows a short film on his portable, fold-up television. Most often, the segments originated from &quot;La Linea&quot;, an Italian animated series about a little man who is drawn (using a single line) at the start of the segment and then springs to life, communicating with his animator through high-pitched Italian mixed with gibberish. Other animated shorts including from the National Film Board of Canada, Weston Woods Studios, and Jim Thurman are always segmented within an episode. Francine, Roy, and Danny sing a song together as the Space Coasters in each episode, sometimes originals or covers of 1960s and 1970s hits. The various puppet characters often sing. A few years into the show&#x27;s run, the MTV-like &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Rory&quot; segment began where a VJ named Rory introduced Danny and the Space Coasters performing cover tunes. Other additions include Baffle, Big Jock Ox, and the Huggles. The action was mostly videotaped on the space set, and sometimes the characters venture down to Earth for filmed songs.

==Characters==
===Space Coasters===
* Francine (portrayed by Emily Bindiger) - Francine, or Fran, is a young woman from a fishing village on the East Coast and is the leader of the Space Coasters where she plays the guitar. She also acts as Baxter&#x27;s second-in-command.
* Danny (portrayed by Chris Gifford) - Danny is from a small midwestern town, a member of the Space Coasters, and Francine&#x27;s second-in-command. He plays the drums in the Space Coasters.
* Roy (portrayed by Ray Stephens) - Roy is from the big city and a member of the Space Coasters where he plays the keyboards. He is also a good poet. Roy showed clips and short films on his hand-held magic screen.

===Coasterville inhabitants===
* Baxter (puppeteered and voiced by Francis Kane) - A large, gentle clown who once worked for M.T. Promises in an apparently slave-like situation at his circus and lives in fear of ever going back. He now pilots the space coaster, taking the characters from Earth to the asteroid. He can magically disappear by twirling around, a talent he uses to escape M.T.&#x27;s attempts to catch him and bring him back to his circus.
* Goriddle Gorilla (puppeteered and voiced by Kevin Clash) - A gravel-voiced orange gorilla-like creature. He has a tendency to be rude, obnoxious, nosy, lazy, and a nuisance, but somehow the gang on the asteroid seem to like him just the way he is. He is roommates with Edison the Elephant.
* Knock Knock the Woodpecker (puppeteered and voiced by John Lovelady in 1981–1983, Noel MacNeal in 1983–1986) - A prissy pink woodpecker who lives in the hollow of a tree and tells a lot of knock-knock jokes.
* Edison the Elephant (puppeteered and voiced by John Lovelady in 1981–1983, Jim Martin in 1983–1986) - A strange, large robotic-looking elephant with a segmented hose-like ever-moving trunk, semi-transparent fan-like ears, and a voice like an echo. He loves plants and tends a large garden. Edison and Goriddle Gorilla are roommates.
* Gary Gnu (puppeteered and voiced by Jim Martin) - A green gnu-like newscaster who hosts &quot;The Gary Gnu Show&quot;. He adds a hard &quot;G&quot; before any words that start with an &quot;N&quot; sound, such as &quot;g-news&quot; for &quot;news&quot; and &quot;g-nothing&quot; for &quot;nothing.&quot; This unusual speaking style was inspired by the 1957 Flanders and Swann song &quot;The Gnu&quot;.
* Speed Reader (portrayed by Ken Myles) - A young man who appears on &quot;The Gary Gnu Show&quot; to discuss children&#x27;s books. Described as &quot;the fastest reader in the world,&quot; he performs a series of eye exercises before reading a book chosen by Gary within seconds.
* M.T. Promises (puppeteered and voiced by Jim Martin) - A nefarious, bulgy-eyed, top hat-wearing, caped ringmaster who is the primary antagonist of the series. He has always been scheming to capture Baxter the Clown and take him back to his circus.
* The Huggles - Small, furry creatures who have stories read to them by Baxter (usually about &quot;Bomba the Barbarian&quot;). They consist of Fluffy, Puffy (both puppeteered and voiced by Pam Arciero), and Scruffy (puppeteered and voiced by Kevin Clash). They also have a younger sister named Baby Huggle (puppeteered and voiced by Pam Arciero) who appears later on and who spends most of her time sleeping.
* Rory (puppeteered and voiced by Kevin Clash) - A wild-looking lion-like VJ. He appeared a few years into the show&#x27;s run as the host of &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Rory&quot;.
* Baffle (puppeteered and voiced by Jim Martin) - A furry, horned magical alien from the neighboring planet Blip (where everything is either backward or upside down or just weird).
* Big Jock Ox (puppeteered and voiced by Kevin Clash) - An ox-like character who appeared a few years into the show&#x27;s run. Big Jock Ox often appeared on &quot;The Gary Gnu Show&quot; as the sports expert.

<doc id="1196198" wikidata="Q966273" url="?curid=1196198" title="Duke of Mouchy">
<text>Duke of Mouchy () was a hereditary title in the peerage of Spain, accompanied by the dignity of Grandee and granted in 1747 by Ferdinand VI to Philippe de Noailles, a French military officer. After failure of the 1st Duke&#x27;s successors in inheriting the dukedom through the established legal procedures, the title expired in the Kingdom of Spain. Withal, it was bestowed by Louis XVIII of France on the eldest son of the 1st Duke in 1817 as a title in the French peerage. 

The Dukedom of Mouchy has since been held by members of a cadet branch of the Noailles family. Owing to the political system of France, a republic, the title is unrecognised (as with all titles). The title could have nonetheless been rehabilitated legally in Spain prior to 1988, when a legal reform was made prohibiting titles with more than forty years of disuse from being revived.

==Dukes of Mouchy (Spain, 1747)==

The founder of the branch, Philippe de Noailles (1715–1794), comte de Noailles, was a younger brother of Louis, 4th duc de Noailles. He was named principe de Poix (prince of Poix) in 1729 by King Philip V of Spain. That same year his aunt-in-law Marguerite-Thérèse Rouillé, duchesse de Richelieu, had died, leaving to Philippe the lands of the principality of Poix. It is unknown how many more subsequent holders of this title existed legally in the peerage of Spain.

*Philippe de Noailles, 1st Duke of Mouchy

==Dukes of Mouchy (France, 1817)==
Philippe Louis Marc Antoine, comte de Noailles and Prince of Poix (1752–1819), elder surviving son of the 1st Spanish duque de Mouchy was made duc de Mouchy and a peer of France in 1817 by King Louis XVIII of France.

From the creation of the French peerage, the holders have been:

* Philippe-Louis-Marc-Antoine de Noailles, 1st duc de Mouchy (1752–1819)
* Charles-Arthur-Tristan-Languedoc de Noailles, 2nd duc de Mouchy (1771–1834)
* Antonin Claude Dominique Just de Noailles, 3rd duc de Mouchy (1777–1846)
* Charles-Philippe-Henri de Noailles, 4th duc de Mouchy (1808–1854)
* Antonin-Just-Léon-Marie de Noailles, 5th duc de Mouchy (1841–1909)

The unrecognised titleholders since the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870 are:
* Henri-Antoine-Marie de Noailles, 6th duc de Mouchy (1890–1947)
* Philippe François Armand Marie de Noailles, 7th duc de Mouchy (1922–2011)
* Antoine-Georges-Marie de Noailles, 8th duc de Mouchy (born 1950)

==Noailles==

As a male-line descendant of the 3rd Duke of Noailles, the Duke of Mouchy is also in remainder to this peerage and to the title of Duke of Ayen.

<text>Pump is the tenth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith. It was released on September 12, 1989, by Geffen Records. The album peaked at No. 5 on the US charts, and was certified septuple platinum by the RIAA in 1995.

The album contains the hit singles &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;What It Takes&quot;, &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, which all entered the Top 40 of the Hot 100. It also has certified sales of seven million copies in the U.S. to date, and is tied with its successor &quot;Get a Grip&quot; as Aerosmith&#x27;s second best-selling studio album in the U.S. (&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; leads with nine million). It produced a variety of successes and &quot;firsts&quot; for the band including their first Grammy Award (&quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;). &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; became the first Aerosmith song to hit number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album was the fourth best-selling album of the year 1990.

In the UK, it was the second Aerosmith album to be certified Silver (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in September 1989.

&quot;Pump&quot; was the second of three sequentially recorded Aerosmith albums to feature producer Bruce Fairbairn and engineers Mike Fraser and Ken Lomas at Little Mountain Sound Studios.

Two video documentaries on the recording, &quot;Things That Go Pump in the Night&quot; and &quot;The Making of Pump&quot;, were released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1990, with the latter also released on DVD in 1997.

==Production==
In December 1988, Aerosmith got together at Rik Tinory Productions in Cohasset, Massachusetts to rehearse and compose new songs, as the band members thought the isolated nature of the studio would help their creativity. Over 19 songs were written, split between an &quot;A-list&quot; with songs considered possible hits, such as &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; and &quot;What It Takes&quot;, and the &quot;B-list&quot; having songs yet to be developed such as &quot;Voodoo Medicine Man&quot;. Producer Bruce Fairbairn focused on getting as many hooks on the songs as possible.

Some songs proposed for the album, though never released in their original form, include &quot;Girl&#x27;s Got Somethin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Is Anybody Out There&quot;, &quot;Guilty Kilt&quot;, &quot;Rubber Bandit&quot;, &quot;Sniffin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Sedona Sunrise&quot;. Many songs also had alternate titles, for example, &quot;Voodoo Medicine Man&quot; was originally titled &quot;Buried Alive&quot; and &quot;News for Ya Baby&quot;. The majority of these songs can be seen in photos of the studio&#x27;s whiteboard and in footage from &quot;The Making of Pump&quot;.

In January 1989, the band went to Vancouver to again record at Fairbairn&#x27;s Little Mountain Sound, where the producer had helmed Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t even listen to Bon Jovi,&quot; Steven Tyler protested, &quot;so we didn&#x27;t say, &#x27;Oh, shit, they had a great album,&#x27; and go up there.&quot;

Aerosmith were at Little Mountain Sound at the same time that Mötley Crüe were recording their album &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;. As a result, Steven Tyler and the Margarita Horns (Aerosmith&#x27;s horn section) contributed backing vocals and instrumentation to several tracks on that album. During the vocal sessions, Mick Mars&#x27; guitar sound leaked from the room next door due to Mars&#x27; volume and many amplifiers.

The intention with the album was exploring a rawness that had been glossed over for a commercial sound in &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;. Joe Perry declared that &quot;When we went to do this album, we knew what we wanted, we wanted to strip off a little fat we felt on our last one. We didn&#x27;t say &#x27;We need a drug song or a child abuse song,&#x27; but when they fit, we used them. That&#x27;s Aerosmith: we aren&#x27;t bound by any rules.&quot; This escape from the rules led to the instrumental interludes between the songs. The interludes were done with the collaboration of musician Randy Raine-Reusch, who was brought to the studio after Perry and Tyler visited his house to search for unusual instruments to employ. Many of the lyrics employ sexual themes, which Tyler attributed to having &quot;making up for the lost time&quot; he spent using drugs instead of having sex in the 1970s.
On a 1989 MTV special entitled &quot;Aerosmith Sunday&quot;, Brad Whitford explained the album title with &quot;Now that we&#x27;re off drugs, we&#x27;re all pumped up.&quot;

Steven Tyler regretted not putting lyrics in the album booklet, something that happened because Geffen was afraid the Parents Music Resource Center would protest over lyrical content with many sex and drugs references. To remedy this omission, the lyrics were included in the tour program. The album cover features a black and white photo of a smaller International K Series truck on top of a larger International KB Series truck, both with their cargo beds removed. The chrome International markings on the hoods have been replaced with the letters &quot;F.I.N.E.&quot;, short for &quot;Fucked Up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional&quot; as stated in the album&#x27;s liner notes.

==Lawsuit==
Aerosmith found themselves in a lawsuit after a small rock band named Pump sued Aerosmith&#x27;s management company for service mark infringement. Aerosmith won the case. Aerosmith also found themselves in legal trouble when the songwriting team Holland–Dozier–Holland threatened to sue the band over the main melody in Aerosmith&#x27;s song &quot;The Other Side&quot; which sounded similar to the melody in the song &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Love&quot;. As part of the settlement, Aerosmith agreed to add &quot;Holland–Dozier–Holland&quot; in the songwriting credits for &quot;The Other Side&quot;.

==Reception==

The album received mostly positive reception, and has since been called &quot;a high-water mark of the glam metal era&quot;, that &quot;stands toe to toe against Aerosmith&#x27;s undisputed mid-&#x27;70s classics.&quot; Many critics noted its more classic hard rock sound than the pop metal of its predecessor. 

&quot;At a time when young guns from Mötley Crüe to Poison were doing their level best to hoist the heavy metal crown from the likes of Def Leppard and Bon Jovi,&quot; noted &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;it took a bunch of hoary, addled old stagers like Aerosmith to come up with the year&#x27;s best metal album.&quot;

&quot;Aerosmith is still the reigning king of the hard-rock double entendre,&quot; wrote &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;But &quot;Pump&quot; – like, real subtle – has more going for it than locker-room laughs, such as the vintage high-speed crunch (circa &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;) of &#x27;Young Lust&#x27;, the sassy slap &#x27;n&#x27; tickle of &#x27;My Girl&#x27; and the kitchen-sink sound of &#x27;Janie&#x27;s Got A Gun&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;If fried brains is your idea of a rock dream, the first side will do the job at least as good as whatever raging slab is also your idea of a rock dream,&quot; wrote Robert Christgau. &quot;For five songs, everything loud and acrid about them just keeps on coming--not even tune doctors can stave off the juggernaut. Of course, this band&#x27;s idea of a rock dream is also the traditional &#x27;Young Lust&#x27; and &#x27;Love in an Elevator&#x27;--OK as far as it goes, but I could do with more &#x27;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun,&#x27; in which an abused teenager offs her dad.&quot;

&quot;Messrs Tyler and Perry&quot; observed &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot;, &quot;have cleaned up their act, hoovered their nostrils, added a few more items of choice veg to their cod-pieces and come up with a stonker.&quot;

&quot;Spin&quot; placed it at No. 279 on their list of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years&quot;, and said &quot;Aerosmith gets no respect for locating that perfect sweet spot between the shamelessness of ‘80s sleaze-metal and the self-aware wink of proto-ironic ‘90s MTV culture&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked the album fourth in their ranking of Aerosmith studio albums, and said, &quot;&#x27;Pump,&#x27; like its multiplatinum predecessor, &#x27;Permanent Vacation,&#x27; unabashedly catered to &#x27;80s hair metal trends with glossy mega-productions like &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; and the Grammy-winning &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun,&quot; but it also did a commendable job of reviving the vintage Aerosmith style on loads of amazing tunes&quot;.
