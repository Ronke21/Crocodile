<text>In physiology, tonotopy (from Greek tono = frequency and topos = place) is the spatial arrangement of where sounds of different frequency are processed in the brain. Tones close to each other in terms of frequency are represented in topologically neighbouring regions in the brain. Tonotopic maps are a particular case of topographic organization, similar to retinotopy in the visual system.

Tonotopy in the auditory system begins at the cochlea, the small snail-like structure in the inner ear that sends information about sound to the brain. Different regions of the basilar membrane in the organ of Corti, the sound-sensitive portion of the cochlea, vibrate at different sinusoidal frequencies due to variations in thickness and width along the length of the membrane. Nerves that transmit information from different regions of the basilar membrane therefore encode frequency tonotopically.

This tonotopy then projects through the vestibulocochlear nerve and associated midbrain structures to the primary auditory cortex via the auditory radiation pathway.
Throughout this radiation, organization is linear with relation to placement on the organ of Corti, in accordance to the best frequency response (that is, the frequency at which that neuron is most sensitive) of each neuron. However, binaural fusion in the superior olivary complex onward adds significant amounts of information encoded in the signal strength of each ganglion. Thus, the number of tonotopic maps varies between species and the degree of binaural synthesis and separation of sound intensities; in humans, six tonotopic maps have been identified in the primary auditory cortex.

== History ==

The earliest evidence for tonotopic organization in auditory cortex was indicated by Vladimir E. Larionov in an 1899 paper entitled &quot;On the musical centers of the brain&quot;, which suggested that lesions in an S-shaped trajectory resulted in failure to respond to tones of different frequencies. By the 1920s, cochlear anatomy had been described and the concept of tonotopicity had been introduced. At this time, Hungarian biophysicist, Georg von Békésy began further exploration of tonotopy in the auditory cortex. Békésy measured the cochlear traveling wave by opening up the cochlea widely and using a strobe light and microscope to visually observe the motion on a wide variety of animals including guinea pig, chicken, mouse, rat, cow, elephant, and human temporal bone. Importantly, Békésy found that different sound frequencies caused maximum wave amplitudes to occur at different places along the basilar membrane along the coil of the cochlea, which is the fundamental principle of tonotopy. Békésy was awarded the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  for his work.

In 1946, the first live demonstration of tonotopic organization in auditory cortex occurred at Johns Hopkins Hospital. More recently, advances in technology have allowed researchers to map the tonotopic organization in healthy human subjects using electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. While most human studies agree on the existence of a tonotopic gradient map in which low frequencies are represented laterally and high frequencies are represented medially around Heschl&#x27;s gyrus, a more detailed map in human auditory cortex is not yet firmly established due to methodological limitations

== Sensory mechanisms ==

=== Peripheral nervous system ===

==== Cochlea ====
Tonotopic organization in the cochlea forms throughout pre- and post-natal development through a series of changes that occur in response to auditory stimuli. Research suggests that the pre-natal establishment of tonotopic organization is partially guided by synaptic reorganization; however, more recent studies have shown that the early changes and refinements occur at both the circuit and subcellular levels. In mammals, after the inner ear is otherwise fully developed, the tonotopic map is then reorganized in order to accommodate higher and more specific frequencies. Research has suggested that the receptor guanylyl cyclase Npr2 is vital for the precise and specific organization of this tonotopy. Further experiments have demonstrated a conserved role of Sonic Hedgehog emanating from the notochord and floor plate in establishing tonotopic organization during early development. It is this proper tonotopic organization of the hair cells in the cochlea that allows for correct perception of frequency as the proper pitch.

==== Structural organization ====

In the cochlea, sound creates a traveling wave that moves from base to apex, increasing in amplitude as it moves along a tonotopic axis in the basilar membrane (BM). This pressure wave travels along the BM of the cochlea until it reaches an area that corresponds to its maximum vibration frequency; this is then coded as pitch. High frequency sounds stimulate neurons at the base of the structure and lower frequency sounds stimulate neurons at the apex. This represents cochlear tonotopic organization. This occurs because the mechanical properties of the BM are graded along a tonotopic axis; this conveys distinct frequencies to hair cells (mechanosensory cells that amplify cochlear vibrations and send auditory information to the brain), establishing receptor potentials and, consequently frequency tuning. For example, the BM increases in stiffness towards its base.

==== Mechanisms of cochlear tonotopy ====

Hair bundles, or the “mechanical antenna” of hair cells, are thought to be particularly important in cochlear tonotopy. The morphology of hair bundles likely contributes to the BM gradient. Tonotopic position determines the structure of hair bundles in the cochlea. The height of hair bundles increases from base to apex and the number of stereocilia decreases (i.e. hair cells located at the base of the cochlea contain more stereo cilia than those located at the apex).

Furthermore, in the tip-link complex of cochlear hair cells, tonotopy is associated with gradients of intrinsic mechanical properties. In the hair bundle, gating springs determine the open probability of mechanoelectrical ion transduction channels: at higher frequencies, these elastic springs are subject to higher stiffness and higher mechanical tension in tip-links of hair cells.  This is emphasized by the division of labor between outer and inner hair cells, in which mechanical gradients for outer hair cells (responsible for amplification of lower frequency sounds) have higher stiffness and tension.

Tonotopy also manifests in the electrophysical properties of transduction. Sound energy is translated into neural signals through mechanoelectrical transduction. The magnitude of peak transduction current varies with tonotopic position. For example, currents are largest at high frequency positions such as the base of cochlea. As noted above, basal cochlear hair cells have more stereocilia, thus providing more channels and larger currents. Tonotopic position also determines the conductance of individual transduction channels. Individual channels at basal hair cells conduct more current than those at apical hair cells.

Finally, sound amplification is greater in the basal than in the apical cochlear regions because outer hair cells express the motor protein prestin, which amplifies vibrations and increases sensitivity of outer hair cells to lower sounds.

=== Central nervous system ===

==== Cortex ====
Audio frequency, otherwise known as the pitch, is currently the only characteristic of sound that is known with certainty to be topographically mapped in the central nervous system. However, other characteristics may form similar maps in the cortex such as sound intensity, tuning bandwidth, or modulation rate, but these have not been as well studied.

In the midbrain, there exist two primary auditory pathways to the auditory cortex—the lemniscal classical auditory pathway and the extralemniscal non-classical auditory pathway. The lemniscal classical auditory pathway is tonotopically organized and consists of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus and the ventral medial geniculate body projecting to primary areas in the auditory cortex. The non-primary auditory cortex receives inputs from the extralemniscal non-classical auditory pathway, which shows a diffuse frequency organization.

The tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex has been extensively examined and is therefore better understood compared to other areas of the auditory pathway. Tonotopy of the auditory cortex has been observed in many animal species including birds, rodents, primates, and other mammals. In mice, four subregions of the auditory cortex have been found to exhibit tonotopic organization. The classically divided A1 subregion has been found to in fact be two distinct tonopic regions—A1 and the dorsomedial field (DM). Auditory cortex region A2 and the anterior auditory field (AAF) both have tonotopic maps that run dorsoventrally. The other two regions of the mouse auditory cortex, the dorsoanterior field (DA) and the dorsoposterior field (DP) are non-tonotopic. While neurons in these non-tonotopic regions have a characteristic frequency, they are arranged randomly.

Studies using non-human primates have generated a hierarchical model of auditory cortical organization consisting of an elongated core consisting of three back-to-back tonotopic fields—the primary auditory field A1, the rostral field R, and the rostral temporal field RT. These regions are surrounded by belt fields (secondary) regions and higher-order parabelt fields. A1 exhibits a frequency gradient from high to low in the posterior-to-anterior direction; R exhibits a reverse gradient with characteristic frequencies from low to high in the posterior-to-anterior direction. RT has a less clearly organized gradient from high back to low frequencies. These primary tonotopic patterns continuously extend into the surrounding belt areas.

Tonotopic organization in the human auditory cortex has been studied using a variety of non-invasive imaging techniques including magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The primary tonotopic map in the human auditory cortex is along Heschl&#x27;s gyrus(HG). However, various researchers have reached conflicting conclusions about the direction of frequency gradient along HG. Some experiments found that tonotopic progression ran parallel along HG while others found that the frequency gradient ran perpendicularly across HG in a diagonal direction, forming an angled V-shaped pair of gradients.

==== In mice ====
One of the well-established methods of studying tonotopic patterning in the auditory cortex during development is tone-rearing. In mouse Primary Auditory Cortex (A1), different neurons respond to different ranges of frequencies with one particular frequency eliciting the largest response – this is known as the &quot;best frequency&quot; for a given neuron. Exposing mouse pups to one particular frequency during the auditory critical period (postnatal day 12 to 15) will shift the &quot;best frequencies&quot; of neurons in A1 towards the exposed frequency tone.

These frequency shifts in response to environmental stimuli have been shown to improve performance in perceptual behavior tasks in adult mice that were tone-reared during auditory critical period. Adult learning and critical period sensory manipulations induce comparable shifts in cortical topographies, and by definition adult learning results in increased perceptual abilities. The tonotopic development of A1 in mouse pups is therefore an important factor in understanding the neurological basis of auditory learning.

Other species also show similar tonotopic development during critical periods. Rat tonotopic develop is nearly identical to mouse, but the critical period is shifted slightly earlier, and barn owls show an analogous auditory development in Interaural Time Differences (ITD).

==== Plasticity of auditory critical period ====
The auditory critical period of rats, which lasts from postnatal day 11 (P11) to P13 can be extended through deprivation experiments such as white noise-rearing. It has been shown that subsets of the tonotopic map in A1 can be held in a plastic state indefinitely by exposing the rats to white noise consisting of frequencies within a particular range determined by the experimenter. For example, exposing a rat during auditory critical period to white noise that includes tone frequencies between 7 kHz and 10 kHz will keep the corresponding neurons in a plastic state far past the typical critical period–one study has retained this plastic state until the rats were 90 days old.
Recent studies have also found that release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is required for critical period plasticity in the auditory cortex, however intrinsic tonotopic patterning of the auditory cortical circuitry occurs independently from norepinephrine release.
A recent toxicity study showed that in-utero and postnatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) altered overall primary auditory cortex (A1) organization, including tonotopy and A1 topography. Early PCB exposure also changed the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, which altered the ability of the auditory cortex to plastically reorganize after changes in the acoustic environment, thereby altering the critical period of auditory plasticity.

==== Adult plasticity ====

Studies in mature A1 have focused on neuromodulatory influences and have found that direct and indirect vagus nerve stimulation, which triggers neuromodulator release, promotes adult auditory plasticity. Cholinergic signaling has been shown to engage 5-HT3AR cell activity across cortical areas and facilitate adult auditory plasticity. Furthermore, behavioral training using rewarding or aversive stimuli, commonly known to engage cholinergic afferents and 5-HT3AR cells, has also been shown to alter and shift adult tonotopic maps.

<text>A seniūnija (in English: eldership, elderate, ward, parish, or subdistrict) is the smallest administrative division of Lithuania. An eldership may comprise a very small region consisting of few villages, one single town, or a part of a big city. Elderships vary in size and population depending on their location and nature. A few elderships make up a municipality. Šilainiai, Dainava, Verkiai, Žirmūnai and Pašilaičiai are the most populous elderates, with population counts over , around twice the population of some entire municipalities.

Elderships manage small-scale local matters, such as repairing pavements and dirt roads, and keep records on all families living in the eldership. The premise of the concept is that — unlike in higher administrative divisions — an elder (the leader of the eldership) could have time to talk to every person in the eldership who wants to.

Modern Lithuania is divided into 10 counties, 60 municipalities, and 546 elderships. Elderships function as municipal districts. In cities, an elder is elected to each eldership district, along with a mayor for the city.

In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the term referred to significantly larger administrative units, such as the Eldership of Samogitia, the name of the Duchy of Samogitia during 1422-1441.

<doc id="1222470" wikidata="Q4547137" url="?curid=1222470" title="10th Princess Mary's Own Gurkha Rifles">
<text>The 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, (abbreviated to 10 GR), was originally a rifle regiment of the British Indian Army. The regiment was formed in 1890, taking its lineage from a police unit and over the course of its existence it had a number of changes in designation and composition. It took part in a number of campaigns on the Indian frontiers during the 19th and early 20th centuries, before fighting in the First World War, the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Second World War. Following India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the regiment was one of four Gurkha regiments to be transferred to the British Army. In the 1960s it was active in the Malayan Emergency and Indonesian Confrontation. It was amalgamated with the other three British Gurkha regiments to form the Royal Gurkha Rifles in 1994.

== History ==

===Early history===
At the end of the Third Burmese War in 1887, it was decided to withdraw the regular army battalions and replace them with a freshly recruited military police force. Recruited in India, it was intended that the military police would be a temporary force which would establish order in districts of upper Burma and then hand over those districts to the civil police. The military police would then be used to form additional regular battalions of the Indian Army. The Kubo (Kabaw) Valley Military Police were raised on 9 April 1887 by Sir F.B. Norman (OC Eastern Frontier Brigade) at Manipur in India and was composed in equal numbers of Gurkha and Assam hillmen recruits. The first commander was Lieutenant C.W. Harris. The battalion moved to Burma and was initially stationed at Tamu.

In 1890, it was decided to convert the Kubo Valley Military Police Battalion in Burma into a new battalion with the title of 10th Madras Infantry. The original 10th Madras Infantry, one of the oldest battalions in the Indian Army, had recently been disbanded. The new battalion had no association with the old except for the name. The relics of the battalion were eventually taken back to India.

The 10th Madras Infantry was formed from the Kubo Valley Military Police on 1 June 1890 under the command of Major Macgregor at Mandalay Palace. The battalion did not inherit the precedence or honours of the 10th Madras Infantry at that time, by decision of the army authorities. Their reasoning being that it would be incorrect to give such a new battalion the precedence and honours of one of the oldest battalions in India. But it was also true that the composition of the 10th Madras Infantry had been through similar drastic changes in composition. For example, after the Mahratta wars, its composition was changed from Northern Indian to Southern Indian.

The initial strength of the battalion was three British officers, eight Indian officers and 277 other ranks. It was not at first exclusively Gurkha in composition. The battalion was initially composed of Gurkha detachments transferred from the 42nd, 43rd and 44th Gurkha Rifles, an equal number of men from the hill-tribes of Assam including Jhurwahs, small numbers of Dogras and a few Hindustanis. The non-Gurkhas were gradually wasted out of the regiment.

In its first few years of existence, the regiment was referred to by two different names in the Indian Army Lists. In 1890 it was called the 10th (Burma) Regiment of Madras Infantry and the following year it was called the 10th Regiment (1st Burma Battalion) of Madras Infantry. But in reality, the second name was the one used by the battalion until 1892.

It became the 10th Regiment (1st Burma Rifles) of Madras Infantry on 9 February 1892 at Maymyo in Burma. It was at this time, with the conversion of the unit to a Rifle Regiment, that the old colours of the 10th Madras were taken back to India (rifle regiments do not carry colours) and laid up at the Church of St. John in the fort at Vellore near to where the earliest predecessor of the 10th Madras Infantry had been raised in 1766. On 3 May 1895 the name of the regiment was changed again to 10th Regiment (1st Burma Gurkha Rifles) of Madras Infantry to reflect its now all-Gurkha composition.

On 13 September 1901, as part of a broad reorganisation of the Indian Army, it became the 10th Gurkha Rifles and the regiment maintained its assigned recruiting areas in the Limbu and Rai tribal areas of eastern Nepal. A 2nd Battalion was formed in 1903 although it became the 1st Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles in 1907. A new 2nd Battalion of the 10th Gurkha Rifles was formed in 1908. From 1903 to 1912 the first battalion was stationed in Maymyo, Burma as almost a ceremonial unit. In the winter months of 1912 and 1913 the 1st Battalion was sent into the Kachin Hills to guard against a potential uprising that did not occur.

===First World War===

The First World War between the UK, France and their allies against Germany and its allies, began in August, 1914. The 1st Battalion remained in Burma providing reinforcements and replacements to the 2nd Battalion which was on active service until 1916. At least five drafts were supplied. The third draft was sunk at sea by an Austrian submarine in the Aegean Sea with the loss of 187 men.

The 2nd Battalion fought in the Middle East, against the Ottomans in the Defence of the Suez Canal, Egypt in 1915. The Ottomans had attempted to cross the canal into Egypt but the Allied forces there successfully repulsed the attack, decimating them as they attempted the crossing. As a result of the 2nd Battalion&#x27;s involvement in this campaign, the regiment gained the battle honour &quot;Suez Canal&quot; and the theatre honour &quot;Egypt 1915&quot;.

Later that year the 2nd Battalion, as part of the 29th Indian Brigade, took part in the Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottomans. The brigade had initially been intended to be part of the New Zealand and Australian Division in the landing at Anzac Cove but instead was directed to assist at Cape Helles where the situation was deteriorating since the assault on 25 April. The brigade landed at Cape Helles in early May and the 2nd Battalion took part in the Battle of Gully Ravine which began on 28 June. The brigade as a whole was moved to Anzac Cove in August where it took part in the August Offensive. The 2nd Battalion suffered heavy casualties during its participation in the Gallipoli campaign. The forces at Anzac and Suvla were evacuated in December 1915, although the last British troops did not leave until January 1916, from Helles.

On 15 August 1916 the 1st Battalion embarked from Rangoon for the Middle East after a farewell ceremony given by the Governor of Burma. Both battalions of the regiment fought in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) from 1916, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire, an ally of the Germans. The Mesopotamian campaign had started in 1914. Much of the regiment&#x27;s involvement in the war was relatively quiet but it did take part in a number of engagements including the offensive against Baghdad in 1917 and the last battle of the Mesopotamian campaign in late October 1918, Sharqat.

The 1st Battalion remained in Mesopotamia upon the conclusion of the war. It saw service during the revolt of Southern Kurdistan in 1919 and the rest of Iraq. Elsewhere, the 2nd Battalion took part in the Third Afghan War in 1919 and in operations in the North-West Frontier.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War the regiment raised a further two battalions, the 3rd Battalion in 1940 and the 4th Battalion in 1941.

====Middle East and Italy====
A coup in Iraq took place in 1941. An Iraqi military group with ties to Germany deposed the Iraqi Monarchy. As a consequence the British launched an invasion of Iraq to restore the Government, the 2nd Battalion participated as part of the 10th Indian Infantry Division. An Armistice was signed with Iraq after British forces entered the Iraqi capital Baghdad on 31 May and the Iraqi Monarchy was restored, the coup leader Rashid Ali had fled, first to Iran and then to Germany. The battalion later took part in the invasion of Vichy France-controlled Syria later in the year. The battalion took part in the Battle of Deir ez Zor for which the regiment received another battle honour.

The 1st Battalion later took part in operations in Iran and the Italian campaign. In Italy the battalion took part in a number of engagements including at Coriano and Santarcangelo in September 1944 for which the regiment won more battle honours. The battalion saw further service the following year in the tough terrain of Italy. During one incident a patrol of the battalion encountered a German detachment. Close-combat ensued, Rifleman Ganjabahadur Rai charged two Germans, dispatching both with his Kukri. The rifleman was killed shortly thereafter by a number of other Germans. A Kukri-scarred rifle, (belonging to one of the Germans who had attempted to defend himself with it during his encounter with Rifleman Rai), was captured by the Gurkhas and kept as a trophy. Another instance of Gurkhas killing German soldiers with their Kukris, while attached to the 10th Mtn Div (US) in Italy in early 1945, was related by Lieut-Col. E. N. Cory Jr., BC 616th FA (Pack), a mountain artillery battalion. The Gurkhas would stalk pairs of German sentries at night and routinely dispatch the one awake, leaving the sleeping sentry to find his dead comrade. In response, the German command ordered the summary execution of any allied soldier captured with a knife. Accordingly, soldiers of the 10th Mtn Div carried no knives, yet continue to display blood-red crossed-knives as part of their shoulder insignia.

The 2nd Battalion was attached to the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, then at Shaibah near Basra, in January 1943. It had recently returned from the Western Desert, after having been almost destroyed at the Battle of Gazala in May 1942.

At the end of the month the brigade was renamed the 43rd Indian Infantry Brigade (Lorried). The brigade and its Gurkha battalions were sent to Italy in mid-1944 as an independent formation.

====Far East====
The regiment was heavily involved against the Japanese with the 1st, 3rd and 4th Battalions taking part in the Burma Campaign. The Japanese had swiftly invaded British territories in the Far East, including Burma, shortly after they launched the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. The 1st Battalion was rushed to Burma, arriving in March 1942 just a week before the evacuation of Rangoon. The battalion conducted a fighting retreat hundreds of miles overland from Burma, reaching India in May 1942.

From November 1943 to August 1945 the 4th Battalion distinguished itself in the fighting in Burma under 20th Indian Division. 

The regiment was heavily involved at Imphal. It was besieged by the Japanese for a number of months, the Allied defenders stoutly resisting all attempts to dislodge them. The siege was eventually lifted after victory at Kohima and Allied forces were soon launching their own offensive into Burma. 

During this particular period the 3rd Battalion saw intense fighting at Scraggy Hill and Shenam Pass where the battalion was embroiled in heavy fighting with Japanese forces, the battalion often employing their kukris in fierce hand-to-hand combat against the Japanese.

The Allied offensive was successful, pushing the Japanese forces back into Burma, the regiment took part in many engagements in the country. In 1945 the regiment took part in the effort to capture Mandalay; British forces entered the city on 20 March. The regiment also took part in the capture of Meiktila, which was taken in early March. In that same month the 10th Gurkhas took part in the defence of Meiktila during a Japanese counter-attack which was repulsed by the Allied defenders. The capital Rangoon was liberated by British forces on 3 May. The regiment saw much more action during the latter months of the Burma campaign.

Representatives of the regiment, as with all units that were involved in the Burma campaign, took part in the Victory Parade in Rangoon on 15 June. The 10th Gurkhas accumulated 19 battle honours for their participation in the campaign—including the theatre honour &quot;Burma 1942–45&quot;—the most Battle Honours gained by any unit in the Burma campaign.

The 1st Battalion was given one further duty. It was charged with taking the formal surrender of the 28th Japanese Army in Burma at Paung on 29 October 1945. The ceremony took place with a table covered with the regimental flag, a second banner also flew under the Union Jack.

===Post-War===
The 4th Battalion was disbanded in 1946, the 3rd Battalion was disbanded the following year.

India gained independence from the British Empire in 1947. As a consequence of the Tripartite Agreement between India, Nepal and the UK, four of the 10 Gurkha regiments (eight Battalions in all), were transferred to the British Army; the 10th Gurkha Rifles being one of them. It joined the Brigade of Gurkhas which was formed to administer the Gurkha units transferred to the British Army. Before independence, the battalion decided to take the old colours of the 10th Madras Infantry out of India with it. Consideration was given to taking the regimental memorial at All-Saints Church in Maymyo Burma, which had been damaged by the Japanese during the war, but it was decided to leave it behind because of the expense involved and the uncertainty over where it could be relocated. It consisted of marble on the floor of the sanctuary and wooden plaques on the walls.

The 1st Battalion served in Burma after the war and was one of the three battalions attending the independence ceremony in Rangoon in January 1948. It then moved by sea to Malaya.

In 1949 the regiment&#x27;s name was altered to become the 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (10 GR) in honour of HRH Princess Mary, Princess Royal. The regiment was affiliated with the Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment), the oldest regiment in the regular army in 1950.

Meanwhile, on operations, the 1st and 2nd Battalions took part in the Malayan Emergency against Communist insurgents, known as Communist Terrorists or CTs. The CTs had launched an uprising in 1948 in support of their perception that Malayan independence did not directly lead to the installation of a Communist government. The 10th Gurkhas were involved in the Emergency from the beginning, the conflict was similar to the Burma campaign. The regiment remained involved until the official conclusion of the Emergency in 1960. The regiment lost 75 men during the conflict.
Another conflict in the Far East began in 1962, the Indonesian Confrontation, after an Indonesian-backed rebellion took place in Brunei and Borneo was swiftly quelled. The following year hostilities broke out between British-backed Malaysia and Indonesia. The two battalions of the regiment undertook two tours each, taking place in 1964 and 1965 respectively. In 1965 the regiment gained its first, and only, Victoria Cross (VC). Lance-Corporal Rambahadur Limbu of the 2nd Battalion received the VC for his actions in an incident in the Bau district in Sarawak, Borneo during Operation Claret which was carried out against Indonesian-held Kalimantan. This action has subsequently become known as the Battle of Bau. The conflict concluded in 1966, by which time the 10th Gurkhas had suffered 11 men killed.

In 1968 the regiment was reduced to a single battalion when the 1st Battalion absorbed the 2nd Battalion. It remained in the Far East, based in Hong Kong, until 1973 when it was sent to England for the first time. Initially it was based at Church Crookham in Hampshire, however, the following year the regiment was dispatched to Cyprus to protect the British Sovereign Base Area at Dhekelia in the aftermath of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. During their deployment the 10th Gurkhas attempted to keep the peace, at times literally having to place themselves in the line-of-fire between the opposing factions. The 1st Battalion was deployed to Brunei for the first time in 1977. Since the rebellion in 1962 in which a Marxist, Indonesian-backed uprising had occurred, a Gurkha battalion has been present in Brunei at the request of HM the Sultan.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the regiment was deployed to Hong Kong, Brunei and Church Crookham. The regiment performed internal security (IS) duties in Hong Kong, including patrolling the border with China in an attempt at preventing the illegal immigration of people to the colony.

In 1990 the regiment was authorised after almost 100 years of requests, to maintain the lineage of the 10th Madras Infantry, thus gaining the battle honours and traditions going back to the 14th Battalion of Coast Sepoys who had been raised by the East India Company in 1766. The lineage is special in that it is among the oldest in the British Indian Army. Although the lineage was granted, the history of the regiment is not continuous. The modern regiment was re-formed exclusively from the Kubo Valley Military Police after the old 10th Madras had been disbanded.

The regiment deployed to Hong Kong for the last time in 1991, remaining there until amalgamation in 1994.

The 10th Gurkhas were amalgamated with the 2nd, 6th and 7th Gurkha Rifles to form the Royal Gurkha Rifles in 1994; the 10th Gurkhas becoming the 3rd Battalion. In 1996 the Battalion was amalgamated with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles while in Brunei.

<text>Arthur Robert Smith (23 January 1933 – 3 February 1975) was a Scotland international rugby union player. He played as a Wing.

==Rugby Union career==

===Amateur career===

Originally from Castle Douglas in Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland, he graduated in mathematics at Glasgow University and then gained a PhD at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He represented Cambridge in four Varsity Matches from 1954 to 1957 inclusive. It was at Cambridge that he came to flourish as a player.

Smith played for a number of sides including Glasgow University, Cambridge University, London Scottish F C, Gosforth, Ebbw Vale, Edinburgh Wanderers and Barbarians FC (the latter on their famous 1957 Easter tour of Wales, when they beat Cardiff RFC 40–0). One of the clubs that Arthur played for was Ebbw Vale, in Wales, and it is rumoured that having been selected by the British Lions that he played a game for Ebbw Vale under another name because Lions were banned from playing after Easter.

===International career===

He captained both Scotland and the British Lions. He won 33 caps for Scotland and was never dropped until his retirement in 1962, although he did miss some matches due to injury. He also became Scotland&#x27;s captain, which is a rare honour for a winger.

His debut was in 1955, a Dark Age for Scottish rugby, as the national team had just lost seventeen tests in a row. Smith helped to break this losing streak by scoring a try in a 35–10 defeat of Wales at Murrayfield, which was probably one of the biggest upsets in post-war rugby.

Smith also captained the 1960 Scotland rugby union tour of South Africa, the first major tour undertaken by a Home Union, and scored eight points in Scotland&#x27;s 18–10 loss.

He was twice a British Lion, both times in South Africa (1955 and 1962). Smith did not play in any of the internationals against in 1955 but he captained the touring party in 1962 and played in the first three internationals before being forced to miss the final match through injury.

==Profiles==

Richard Bath writes of him that:
:&quot;&quot;As well as possessing searing pace, the farmer&#x27;s son from Castle Douglas in Galloway also possessed great intellect and gained a first class degree in maths from Glasgow University before completing his PhD at Cambridge - and all that while winning 33 caps for Scotland.&quot;

Allan Massie writes of him that:
:&quot;He was a natural rather than a schooled player, for in his youth he had played [association] football, not Rugby; at Glasgow University he was better known as a long jumper than a Rugby player.&quot;

:&quot;He was never a great improviser, like his contemporary England&#x27;s Peter Jackson, and for this reason many would have put him in second place among the right wings of his time; and he was not the sort of wing who impressed by his brute force and determination. But he was still a deadly finisher. With the ball in hand his two chief devices were the swerve and the change of pace; I have seen no wing to better his control of pace, nor one with a nicer ability to leave an opposing wing or full-back clutching the air... He was always skilful and resourceful, very rarely prepared to let an attack die. He was a master of that now neglected ploy, the cross-kick, which placed the ball just behind the opposing defence for his forwards to run on to... Those of us who watched Arthur Smith have only to close our eyes to see him slip into top gear, like a thoroughbred racehorse. Nobody has ever worn the Number 14 jersey for Scotland since with quite the same authority.&quot;&quot;

Sadly, Arthur Smith died of cancer less than ten years after playing his last international.

<doc id="1222493" wikidata="Q5370763" url="?curid=1222493" title="Emergent gameplay">
<text>Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games, board games, or role-playing games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics.

Designers have attempted to encourage emergent play by providing tools to players such as placing web browsers within the game engine (such as in &quot;Eve Online&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;), providing XML integration tools and programming languages (&quot;Second Life&quot;), fixing exchange rates (&quot;Entropia Universe&quot;), and allowing a player to spawn any object they desire to solve a puzzle (&quot;Scribblenauts&quot;).

==Intentional emergence==
Intentional emergence occurs when some creative uses of the game are intended by the game designers. Since the 1970s and 1980s board games and role playing games such as &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot; or &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; have featured intentional emergence as a primary game function by supplying players with relatively simple rules or frameworks for play that intentionally encouraged them to explore creative strategies or interactions and exploit them toward victory or goal achievement.

===Creative solutions===
Immersive sims, such as &quot;Deus Ex&quot; and &quot;System Shock&quot;, are games built around emergent gameplay. These games give the player-character a range of abilities and tools, and a consistent game world established by rules, but do not enforce any specific solution onto the player, though the player may be guided into suggested solutions. To move past a guard blocking a door, the player could opt to directly attack the guard, sneak up and knock the guard unconscious, distract the guard to move away from their post, or use parkour to reach an alternative opening well out of sight, among other solutions. In such games, it may be possible to complete in-game problems using solutions that the game designers did not foresee; for example in &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, designers were surprised to find players using wall-mounted mines as pitons for climbing walls. A similar concept exists for roguelike games, where emergent gameplay is considered a high-value factor by the 2008 Berlin Interpretation for roguelikes.

Such emergence may also occur in games through open-ended gameplay and sheer weight of simulated content, like in &quot;Minecraft&quot;, &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot; or &quot;Space Station 13&quot;. These games do not have any endgame criteria though they do, similarly to immersive sims, present a consistent and rule-based world. These games will often present the player with tutorials of what they could do within the game. From this, players may follow the intended way to play the game, or can veer in completely different directions, such as extravagant simulated machines within &quot;Minecraft&quot;.

Certain classes of open-ended puzzle games can also support emergent gameplay. The line of games produced by Zachtronics, such as &quot;Spacechem&quot; and &quot;Infinifactory&quot;, are broadly considered programming puzzles, where the player must assemble pieces of a mechanism to produce a specific product from various inputs. The games otherwise have no limits in how many components can be used and how long the process needs to complete, though through in-game leaderboards, players are encouraged to make more efficient solutions than their online friends. While each puzzle is crafted to assure at least one possible solution exists, players frequently find emergent solutions that may be more elegant, use components in unexpected fashions, or otherwise diverge greatly from the envisioned route.

===Emergent narrative===
Some games do not use a pre-planned story structure, even non-linear.

In &quot;The Sims&quot;, a story may emerge from the actions of the player. But the player is given so much control that they are more creating a story than interacting with a story. Emergent narrative would only partially be created by the player. Warren Spector, the designer of &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, has argued that emergent narrative lacks the emotional impact of linear storytelling.

&quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; features a dynamic system for game dramatics, pacing, and difficulty called the Director. The way the Director works is called &quot;Procedural narrative&quot;: instead of having a difficulty which increases to a constant level, the A.I. analyzes how the players fared in the game so far, and tries to add subsequent events that would give them a sense of narrative.

&quot;Minecraft&quot; and &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot; also have emergent narrative features due to the abstraction of how elements are represented in game, allowing system-wide features to apply across multiple objects without the need to develop specialized assets for each different state; this can create more realistic behavior for non-player controlled entities that aid in the emergent narrative. For example, in &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot;, any of the living creatures in the game could gain the state of being intoxicated from alcohol, creating random behavior in their movement from the intoxication but not requiring them to display anything uniquely different, in contrast to a more representational game that would need new assets and models for a drunk creature. Because these are abstract and interacting systems, this can then create emergent behavior the developers had never anticipated.

==Unintentional emergence==
Unintentional emergence occurs when creative uses of the video game were not intended by the game designers.

===Glitch or quirk-based strategies===

Emergent gameplay can arise from a game&#x27;s AI performing actions or creating effects unexpected by even the software developers. This may be by either a software glitch, the game working normally but producing unexpected results when played in an abnormal way or software that allows for AI development; for example the unplanned genetic diseases that can occur in the &quot;Creatures&quot; series.

In several games, especially first-person shooters, game glitches or physics quirks can become viable strategies, or even spawn their own game types. In id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; series, rocket jumping and strafe-jumping are two such examples. In the game &quot;Halo 2&quot;, pressing the melee attack button (B) quickly followed by the reload button (X) and the primary fire button (R trigger) would result in the player not having to wait for the gun to be back in position to shoot after a melee attack. Doing this has become known as &quot;BXR-ing&quot;. Another example includes &quot;&quot;, where animation cancels and weapon switching would eventually develop into a means of traveling along the wall known as &quot;butterfly&quot; in the community.

&quot;&quot; had a glitch in the physics engine which allowed players to &quot;ski&quot; up and down steep slopes by rapidly pressing the jump key, gaining substantial speed in the process. The exploitation of this glitch became central to the gameplay, supplanting the vehicles that had been originally envisioned by the designers as the primary means of traversing large maps.

Thanks to a programming oversight by Capcom, the &quot;combo&quot; (or &quot;2-1 combo&quot;) notion was introduced with the fighting game &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for their opponents to recover, as long as they were timed correctly.

The PlayStation 1 version of the 2004 edition of the FIFA series featured a selection of new attacking skills like off the ball running and touch sensitive passing, all of which were designed for analog controller use. Particularly skilled players had been artificially manipulating these features into the game series since at least the 1999 edition by deft and rapid manipulation of the original non-analogue stick PS controllers. The game was relatively easy to beat on the hardest level on single player, using a series of tricks from the instruction manual which the AI could not replicate consistently or defend against, but long-term players found that in trying to make the game attain to a more realistic football simulation by playing without using these tricks, the simplistic in-game AI would seem to respond by learning osmotically from the player with greater creativity from the opposition teams and an apparent learning intelligence in selecting off the ball players and shot direction, things that were supposed to be impossible with the non-analog controller.

===Changing game objectives===

In online car racing games, particularly &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot;, players came up with an alternative objective known as &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;. The racers play on teams of at least two cars. Each team picks one very slow car as the mouse, and their goal is to have their slow car cross the finish line first. Thus the team members in faster cars aim to push their slow car into the lead and ram their opposing teams&#x27; slow cars off the road.

Completing games without getting certain items or by skipping seemingly required portions of gameplay results in sequence breaking, a technique that has developed its own dedicated community. Often, speed of completion and/or minimalist use of items are respectable achievements. This technique has long been used in the &quot;Metroid&quot; game series and has developed into a community devoted to speedruns. NetHack has over time codified many such challenges as &quot;conduct&quot; and acknowledges players who manage to finish characters with unbroken pacifist or vegetarian disciplines, for example. A comparable form of restricted gameplay has been implemented within &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, known as &quot;Iron Man&quot; leveling.

A change in gameplay can be used to create a &quot;de facto&quot; minigame, such as the &quot;Green Demon Challenge&quot; in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, where the object is to avoid collecting a 1-up which chases the player, even passing through terrain, while the player attempts to collect all red coins on a level. Other challenges have been built around reaching normally unreachable areas or items, sometimes using glitches or gameplaying tools, or by completing a level without using an important game control, such as the &#x27;jump&#x27; button or joystick.

Machinima, the use of computer animation from video game engines to create films, began in 1996. The practice of recording deathmatches in id Software&#x27;s 1996 computer game &quot;Quake&quot; was extended by adding a narrative, thus changing the objective from winning to creating a film. Later, game developers provided increased support for creating machinima; for example, Lionhead Studios&#x27; 2005 game &quot;The Movies&quot;, is tailored for it.

===Real economy interaction===

Traders in MMOs with economic systems play purely to acquire virtual game objects or avatars which they then sell for real-world money on auction websites or game currency exchange sites. This results in the trader&#x27;s play objective to make real money regardless of the original game designer&#x27;s objectives.

Many games prohibit currency trading in the EULA, but it is still a common practice.

Some players provide real world services (like website design, web hosting) paid for with in-game currency. This can influence the economy of the game, as players gain wealth/power in the game unrelated to game events. For example, this strategy is used in Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

<text>A Page of Honour is a ceremonial position in the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. It requires attendance on state occasions, but does not now involve the daily duties which were once attached to the office of page. The only physical activity involved is usually carrying the long train of the Sovereign&#x27;s robes. This position is distinct from that of a page in the Royal Household, which is the senior rank of uniformed staff. 

Pages of Honour participate in major ceremonies involving the British monarch, including coronations and the State Opening of Parliament. It is usually a distinction granted to teenage sons of members of the nobility and gentry, and especially of senior members of the Royal Household.

==Livery==
Pages of Honour in England wear a scarlet frock coat with gold trimmings, a white satin waistcoat, white breeches and hose, white gloves, black buckled shoes and a lace cravat and ruffles. A sword is also worn with the outfit and a feathered three-cornered hat is provided. In Scotland the outfit is identical, but in green rather than scarlet (as seen periodically at the Thistle Service in Edinburgh). In Ireland, when Pages of Honour were attendant upon the King, Pages of Honour wore exactly the same uniform as at the English Court, except that the colour was St. Patrick&#x27;s blue with silver lace.

At coronations, the peers who carry regalia in the procession (and others with particular roles in the service) were expected to have their own pages in attendance. These pages are directed to wear &quot;the same pattern of clothes as the Pages of Honour wear, but of the Livery colour of the Lords they attend... [except that] ...the Royal liveries being scarlet and gold, the use of this combination of colours is restricted to the Pages of Honour, and in the case of a Peer whose colours are scarlet and gold, for scarlet some variant, such as murrey or claret, should be used.&quot;

<doc id="1222502" wikidata="Q1760842" url="?curid=1222502" title="White squall">
<text>A white squall is a sudden and violent windstorm at sea which is not accompanied by the black clouds generally characteristic of a squall. It manifests as a sudden increase in wind velocity in tropical and sub-tropical waters, and may be a microburst. The name refers to the white-capped waves and broken water, its meager warning to any unlucky seaman caught in its path. A white squall was allegedly behind the sinking of the brigantine &quot;Albatross&quot; on May 2, 1961 although, in fact, there were a number of traditional line squalls all around and a microburst was very unlikely. White squalls are rare at sea, but common on the Great Lakes of North America.

==Historical incidents==
White squalls are the culprits of many sea stories and have been blamed for a few tragedies. A white squall was the reported cause of the loss of the schooner &quot;Paul Pry&quot; off Cape Schanck, Australia, on September 3, 1841. In May 1986, the &quot;Pride of Baltimore&quot;, a modern schooner, was reportedly struck by a white squall. The 121-ton vessel sank about north of Puerto Rico, casting the surviving crew members adrift for five days. The &quot;Toro&quot;, a Norwegian freighter, picked them up at 2:30 a.m. May 19, 1986. An eyewitness account described it as follows:

&quot;A tremendous whistling sound suddenly roared through the rigging and a wall of wind hit us in the back. The &quot;Pride&quot; heeled over in a matter of seconds. The wind pushed a high wall of water into the starboard side. She sank in minutes.&quot;

*In Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;HMS Surprise&quot; a white squall is experienced by the crew of &quot;Surprise&quot; en route to the Malay Peninsula north of the equator off the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago near Brazil.
*Stan Rogers&#x27; 1984 song &quot;White Squall&quot; is about the white squalls of the Great Lakes.
*Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;White Squall&quot; tells the story of the 1961 sinking of the &quot;Albatross&quot;.

<text>Kent County Council is a county council that governs the non-metropolitan county of Kent in England. The non-metropolitan county is smaller than the ceremonial county, which additionally includes the unitary authority of Medway. Kent County Council is the upper tier of elected local government, below which are 12 district councils, and around 300 town and parish councils. The county council has 81 elected councillors. It is one of the largest local authorities in England in terms of population served and the largest local authority of its type. The council is based at County Hall in Maidstone. It has been under Conservative majority control since 1997.

==History==
Elected county councils were created in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over many administrative functions that had previously been performed by unelected magistrates at the quarter sessions. The areas covered by the new county councils were termed administrative counties. In Kent the administrative county differed from the historic county in a few places:
*The north-western part of the historic county around Greenwich, Lewisham and Woolwich, which had been administered by the Metropolitan Board of Works since 1856, was transferred to the new County of London.
*Canterbury, which had been a self-governing county corporate since 1471, retained its independence by being made a county borough.
*Urban sanitary districts which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in one county, which saw Tunbridge Wells placed entirely in Kent, having previously straddled Kent and Sussex.

The first elections to the county council were held in January 1889 and it formally came into being on 1 April 1889, on which day it held its first official meeting at the Sessions House in Maidstone. John Farnaby Lennard was appointed the first chairman of the council.

The county council&#x27;s duties at first were few, but gradually it absorbed school boards, the rural highway boards and the boards of guardians. The county council adopted the Sessions House as its meeting place.

In 1965, the London Government Act 1963 abolished the existing county of London and replaced it with a larger administrative area called Greater London, which took over the Bexley and Bromley areas from the administrative county of Kent. In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 saw Kent re-classified as a non-metropolitan county and it gained the formerly independent county borough of Canterbury. Until 1974 the lower tier of local government had comprised numerous boroughs, urban districts and rural districts. As part of the 1974 reforms, the lower tier was reorganised into fourteen non-metropolitan districts.

In 1998 the districts of Gillingham and Rochester-upon-Medway were removed from the non-metropolitan county of Kent to become a new unitary authority called Medway, whilst remaining part of the ceremonial county of Kent.

In November 2022, the county council stated it, alongside Hampshire County Council, may face bankruptcy within 12 months due to austerity cuts.

==Governance==
Kent County Council provides county-level services. District-level services are provided by the twelve district councils:
* Ashford Borough Council
* Canterbury City Council
* Dartford Borough Council
* Dover District Council
* Folkestone and Hythe District Council
* Gravesham Borough Council
* Maidstone Borough Council
* Sevenoaks District Council
* Swale Borough Council
* Thanet District Council
* Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council
* Tunbridge Wells Borough Council
Much of the county is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The county council has been under Conservative majority control since 1997.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1974 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2021 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to November 2024 the composition of the council is as follows:

The Greens and Swale Independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Green and Independents&quot; group. The next election is due in 2025.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 81 councillors representing 72 electoral divisions, with each division electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at County Hall, a complex of buildings on County Road in Maidstone which incorporates the old Sessions House of 1824, which had been the meeting place of the quarter sessions which preceded the county council. The council has various other buildings around the county as well.

==Responsibilities==
The council is responsible for public services such as education, transport, strategic planning, emergency services, social services, public safety and waste disposal.

===Transportation===
Kent Top Travel was owned by Kent County Council, and was established by them in 2005. It operated the council&#x27;s bus network. It was argued that its existence stimulated competition. It also operated a coach charter fleet. The majority of Kent Top Travel&#x27;s route portfolio comprised rural, evening and Sunday services won under competitive tender from Kent County Council and other local authorities in open competition with private bus operators. Kent Top Travel operated Canterbury City Council&#x27;s park &amp; ride service from October 2008 until 2013. Kent Top Travel operated both single and double deck buses as well as charter coaches. Buses were painted in a white and green livery, the Canterbury park &amp; ride fleet silver and green. Coaches were painted both white &amp; red, and yellow.

Following an independent report criticising Kent County Council&#x27;s trading companies, in December 2012 it was decided to close Kent Top Travel once its existing contracts expired. Kent Top Travel ceased trading on 1 October 2013.

==Council structure==
The Council is structured as follows:

;County Council:
The County Council is made up of 81 elected county councillors. The full council meets seven times a year to agree the council&#x27;s Constitution and amendments to it, appoint the Leader, and approve the policy framework and budget (including the level of Council Tax).

;Cabinet:
The cabinet is made up of ten county councillors. The cabinet is responsible for the strategic thinking and decisions that steer how the council is run. The cabinet meets monthly and takes decisions collectively.

;Local Boards:
Local boards are local community groups that hold regular public meetings across Kent, so that the people of Kent can voice issues that affect their community. They also allocate funding to local projects. There are 12 local boards in Kent, and every county councillor is required to be a member of one local board.

The work of the Council is organized into directorates:
;Strategic and Corporate Services: 
supports the work of the directorates by providing specialist expertise and strategic direction. The department also leads and co-ordinates major change and organisational development.: It manages services that include human resources, finance, governance, law and democracy, strategic commissioning, property and infrastructure, information technology, media and communications, consultation and engagement, customer relations including gateways and contact centre, business intelligence and policy.
;Children, Young People and Education: 
It combines Education services with universal and targeted services for children and young people designed to reduce demand for specialist services, also provided in this directorate. By focusing on prevention and early intervention, their aim is to reduce demand in specialist children&#x27;s social services by helping families earlier, improving parenting skills and the health and educational outcomes of young children, ensuring they are school ready. KCC will intervene earlier to support families in crisis through area based working and joined up teams providing a more seamless service and better working arrangements with partner organisations.: This encompasses the Kent Youth County Council which provides the young people of the county to have a voice on the issues that matter to young people aged 11–18. Successes of the youth council include the introduction of the Kent Freedom Pass in 2007, which later rebranded in 2019 to The KCC Travel Saver. The scheme offers significant discounts on bus travel for children and students within Kent, enabling cost savings of up to 50% for eligible users. The Youth County Council holds its elections every November, and four young people from each of the 12 districts are elected to a two-year term. The Kent Youth County Council is also affiliated with the UK Youth Parliament and British Youth Council.

;Adult Social Care and Health: 
Provides support and care for adults who need assistance due to age, disability, or health conditions. It aims to help individuals live as independently as possible while ensuring their well-being and safety.
;Growth, Environment and Transport: 
This includes strategic responsibility for the future of the county in terms of planning, economic development, transport policy, and major transport improvement schemes, waste disposal and recycling services. In addition to a range of leisure and cultural facilities including the Turner Contemporary; country parks; libraries; and enforcement services including trading standards and community safety.

==Joint arrangements with Medway==
Kent County Council co-operates with the unitary Medway Council in many ways, for instance in the Kent and Medway Local Plan, and together they run joint agencies. Kent is combined with Medway for the purposes of representation in Parliament. The combined area elects 17 MPs, of whom 14 represent seats entirely within the Kent County Council area and another whose constituency is in both Kent and Medway.

<text>Illustrated fiction is a hybrid narrative medium in which images and text work together to tell a story. It can take various forms, including fiction written for adults or children, magazine fiction, comic strips, and picture books.

== Illustrated fiction in the 18th century ==
Apart from an occasional portrait or map, 18th century fiction was not usually illustrated, as publishers did not commission illustrations for new novels. In the novel &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot;, the author Henry Fielding refers to paintings by William Hogarth in order to explain what some of his characters look like.
Illustrations were commissioned for already successful books. These illustrated versions were usually published as limited editions and sold through prior subscription. Henry Fuseli created a single frontispiece for the fourth edition of Tobias Smollett&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot;. Thomas Stothard provided several illustrations for an edition of &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; published 30 years after its first publication in 1766.

Near the end of the 18th century, new mechanical techniques allowed pictures to be printed cheaply. Illustrated classics became cheaply available, and were strongly remembered by their readers. John Ruskin was moved by illustrations of Robinson Crusoe crashing into rocks and escaping his wreck. Charles Dickens remembered the illustrations in many books more than the prose itself.

== Illustrated fiction in the 19th century ==

At the beginning of the 19th century, illustration increased the sales of previously published fiction. In 1836, the publication of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; in an illustrated serialized format revolutionised the publication of new fiction. The popularity of the original illustrations in Dickens&#x27;s novels was unprecedented, and helped to popularize the use of illustrations in serious fiction. This revolution lasted until 1870, as other authors and published attempted to emulate Dickens&#x27;s success. Illustrations became common in the period. For publishers, new fiction with illustrations published serially was less of a commercial risk than the traditional unillustrated three-volume sets. Illustrations attracted readers and increased advertising revenue. Illustrations were used as advertisement&#x27;s in booksellers windows.
During the 19th century, the use of photomechanical techniques decreased the cost of reproducing illustrations. Both colour and black and white illustrations were increasingly used in daily, weekly, and monthly publications. Publishers sold a great deal of one-volume hardcovers and periodical serials.

Dickens&#x27;s novels were well-suited to graphic representation. Dickens believed that the drawings that illustrated his fiction were valuable, despite some critics urging him not to use them. Most of his major works were originally published with illustrations. He was intensely involved in the creation of most of the 900 original illustrations of his writing. These illustrations were produced by 18 artists, including George Cruikshank and Robert Seymour.

Most of William Ainsworth&#x27;s, Charles Lever&#x27;s, William Thackeray&#x27;s, and Anthony Trollope&#x27;s major works were initially published in illustrated monthly parts. Later, novelists preferred to publish their writing in illustrated magazines. Thomas Hardy often did this. George Meredith did this twice, and George Eliot once. 19th century author artists included William Makepeace Thackeray and George du Maurier.

Many artists began their careers illustrating fiction. Illustrating was a difficult and badly paid job. Hablot Knight Browne was one of the few very talented artists to pursue illustrating full-time. Most artists, such as Marcus Stone and Luke Fildes, used illustrating as a stepping-stone to a career in painting. Other artists like George Cattermole and Daniel Maclise supplemented their income by providing illustrations.

The popularity of illustrated fiction began to decline in the late 19th century, as illustrations lost their novelty and no longer guaranteed that a novel would sell well. Technological improvements in printing flooded the market with affordable novels with illustrations of high quality. Prestigious artists including John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, and Frederick Leighton started to illustrate books. Illustrations challenged the novel&#x27;s prose, implying a failure in prose&#x27;s self-sufficiency. Prose frequently took second place to illustration.

== Illustrated fiction in the 20th century ==
The amount of illustrated fiction that was published declined from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1930s. By the 1930s, illustrations were rarely used in adult&#x27;s novels. Illustrated serious fiction was not popular over the rest of the century. The decline in the publication of serials, rise in labour costs, and competition from film, television, and photojournalism contributed to its decline. There was also less demand from readers. Historians of Western illustrated fiction mostly agree that film replaced the illustrated book. A review of the 1915 film adaptation of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; said that &quot;the reels make a set of illustrations superior to the conventional pen-pictures of a deluxe edition.&quot;

Modern literary fiction was often not well-suited to illustration, for example the introspective novels of E. M. Forster and Virginia Woolf. Illustrations were used on book covers to attract buyers, but not used within the novel. Similar to the period before 1836, illustrations were not commissioned for new books, but were commissioned for established classics, usually for a limited luxury edition. Serious novels are not illustrated, and illustrated fiction is generally associated with serialized or short fiction that is published in popular but not intellectually prestigious magazines. Children and comics readers became the only fiction readers whose fiction was generally illustrated.

Some authors were concerned that illustrations would date or misinterpret their prose. Henry James disliked illustrations, claiming that illustrations were not needed because prose was sufficiently pictorial. He thought that illustrations and prose were in competition with one another. He permitted his travel books, but not his mature fiction, to be illustrated. Alvin Langdon Coburn&#x27;s photographs were used in the New York edition of his works only as frontispieces, and only after James reassured himself that they did not compete or make a reference to his prose. Similar to James, Thomas Hardy increasingly excluded illustrations from the collected editions of his novels, with the exception of maps that he had drawn and photographic frontispieces.

None of the first or standard editions of James Joyce&#x27;s novels were illustrated during his lifetime, except for an edition of &quot;Ulysses&quot; published by the Limited Editions Club in 1935, which included drawings and etchings by Henri Matisse. Pearl Buck&#x27;s husband Richard J. Walsh, as editor of Asia, included illustrations with Buck&#x27;s work that was published there in serial or complete form. However, as editor and later president of the John Day Company, he did not include illustrations in the subsequent hardcover editions of these novels. When Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novella &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was first published in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1952, it was illustrated with blue-tinted drawings by Noel Sickles. These illustrations were not included in its first publication in volume form, published by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons. 
In the middle of the 20th century, the comic strip used visual images to convey action and had a great influence on children and young people. Comic books have unique storytelling potential.

<text>Alan Boone Helffrich (August 7, 1900 – February 3, 1994) was an American athlete, winner of gold medal in 4 × 400 m relay at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

Born in Yonkers, New York, Alan Helffrich was one of America&#x27;s greatest middle-distance runners in the 1920s. Helffrich won the AAU titles in 880 yd in 1921, 1922 and 1925. As a Pennsylvania State University student, he won the NCAA championships in 880 yd in 1922 and 1923 and IC4A championships in 880 yd in 1923 and in 440 yd in 1924.

At the Paris Olympics, Helffrich ran the final leg in the American 4 × 400 m relay team, which won the gold medal with a new world record of 3.16.0. Helffrich was the only runner to defeat Paavo Nurmi when the Finn toured the United States in 1925, scoring a victory in the half-mile run at the Yankee Stadium. He ended Nurmi&#x27;s 121-race win streak that had started in 1921.

After his running career, Helffrich officiated at athletics meets in New York City from 1930 to 1955 and served, until his death at age 93, as president of the New York Chapter of the United States Olympians.

<doc id="1222524" wikidata="Q3241738" url="?curid=1222524" title="Echo and Narcissus">
<text>Echo and Narcissus is a myth from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, a Roman mythological epic from the Augustan Age. The introduction of the mountain nymph, Echo, into the story of Narcissus, the beautiful youth who rejected Echo and fell in love with his own reflection, appears to have been Ovid&#x27;s invention. Ovid&#x27;s version influenced the presentation of the myth in later Western art and literature.

==Story==
The myth is told in Book III of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, and tells the story of Echo, a mountain nymph from Mount Cithaeron, and Narcissus, a hunter from a Thespiae in Boeotia, known for his many admirers and his beauty, but also his callous rejections of those admirers.

Echo was a &quot;very talkative nymph&quot;, whom the goddess Venus admires for her magnificent voice and song. She distracted the goddess Juno by talking for hours while her husband, Jupiter, had affairs with other nymphs. One day, when Echo tricks Juno into believing that Jupiter was in the city, Juno curses Echo by making her unable to initiate a spoken sentence on her own, and instead only being able to, in speech, finish a sentence started by someone else. &quot;Yet a chatterbox, had no other use of speech than she has now, that she could repeat only the last words out of many.&quot; This is the explanation of the aural effect which was named after her.

Narcissus was born to Liriope, a Naiad, and Cephissus, a river god. When he was born, Liriope asked the prophet, Tiresias, if he would live a long life, to which he replied “so long as he never knows himself.”

The prophet’s words would prove to be true as, sometime after being cursed, Echo spied Narcissus, while he was out hunting deer with his companions. She immediately fell in love with him and, infatuated, followed quietly. The more she looked at the young man, the more she longed for him. Though she wished with all her heart to call out to Narcissus, Juno&#x27;s curse prevented her.

During the hunt, Narcissus became separated from his companions and called out, ‘is anyone there,’ and heard the nymph repeat his words. Startled, Narcissus answered the voice, ‘come here,’ only to be told the same. When Narcissus saw that nobody had emerged from the glade, he concluded that the owner of the voice must be running away from him and called out again. Finally, he shouted, &quot;This way, we must come together.&quot; Taking this to be a reciprocation of her love, Echo concurred ecstatically, &quot;We must come together!&quot;

In her delight, Echo rushed to Narcissus ready to throw her arms around her beloved. Narcissus, however, was appalled and, spurning her, exclaimed, ‘Hands off! May I die before you enjoy my body.’ All Echo could whisper in reply was, ‘enjoy my body’ and having done so she fled, scorned, humiliated, and shamed.

Despite the harshness of his rejection, Echo&#x27;s love for Narcissus only grew. Echo&#x27;s fellow nymphs prayed to Nemesis to punish Narcissus with a love that was equally not reciprocated. Nemesis caused him to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water where he wasted away and died, unable to take his eyes away from the beautiful youth he did not recognise as himself. Narcissus, looking one last time into the pool uttered, &quot;Oh marvellous boy, I loved you in vain, farewell&quot;, Echo too chorused, &quot;Farewell.&quot;
When the time came for Narcissus&#x27;s funeral, people came to where he lay, but found no body. All that was left of Narcissus was the six-petalled white flower arranged around a golden centre that was named after him. 

As the other nymphs took Narcissus into the afterlife, they wailed a sorrowful song, and Echo repeated the last syllabic wails back, in sadness. When the river master of death brought Narcissus on the boat across the Styx into the afterlife, Narcissus stared at his reflection, in unrequited desire.

Eventually, Echo, too, began to waste away. Though she was immortal, her body faded and her bones turned to stone until all that remained of Echo was the sound of her voice.

<text>The Australian Government, also known as the Commonwealth Government, or simply as the federal government, is the national executive government of Australia, a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The executive consists of the prime minister and other cabinet ministers that currently have the support of a majority of the members of the House of Representatives (the lower house) and also includes the departments and other executive bodies that ministers oversee. The current executive government consists of Anthony Albanese and other ministers of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), in office since the 2022 federal election.

The prime minister is the head of the federal government and is a role which exists by constitutional convention, rather than by law. They are appointed to the role by the governor-general (the federal representative of the monarch of Australia). The governor-general normally appoints the parliamentary leader who commands the confidence of a majority of the members of the House of Representatives. Also by convention, the prime minister is a member of the lower house.

The prime minister and their sworn ministers form the cabinet, the key decision-making organ of the government that makes policy and decides the agenda of the government. Members of the government can exercise both legislative power (through their control of the parliament) and executive power (as ministers on behalf of the governor-general and the monarch). However, in accordance with responsible government, and to ensure accountability, actions of the government in its executive capacity are subject to scrutiny from parliament.

The Australian Government is headquartered in the executive wing of Parliament House, located in the nation&#x27;s capital, Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory. The head offices of all the federal departments are also located in Canberra.

== Name ==
The name of the government in the Constitution of Australia is the &quot;Government of the Commonwealth&quot;. This was the name used in many early federal government publications. 

However, in 1965 Robert Menzies indicated his preference for the name &quot;Australian Government&quot; in order to prevent confusion with the new Commonwealth of Nations. The Whitlam government legislated the use of &quot;Government of Australia&quot; in 1973 in line with its policy of promoting national goals and aspirations. However, academic Anne Twomey argues that the government was also motivated by a desire to blur the differences between the Commonwealth and the states in an attempt to increase federal power. The Parliament of Australia website also notes that the name &quot;Australian Government&quot; is preferable in order to avoid confusion with the Commonwealth of Nations and the US federal government by those not familiar with Australia&#x27;s system of government. This terminology remains preferred by the government. However, the terms Commonwealth Government and federal government are also common.

In some contexts, the term &quot;government&quot; refers to all public agencies that exercise the power of the State, whether legislative, executive or judicial.

==Executive power==

The government&#x27;s primary role, in its executive capacity, is to implement the laws passed by the parliament. However, laws are frequently drafted according to the interests of the executive branch as the government often also controls the legislative branch.

Unlike the other two branches of government, however, membership of the executive is not clearly defined. One definition describes the executive as a pyramid, consisting of three layers. At the top stands the king, as the symbolic apex and formal repository of executive power. Below him lies a second layer made up of the prime minister, cabinet and other ministers who in practice lead the executive. Finally, the bottom layer includes public servants, police, government departments and independent statutory bodies who directly implement policy and laws.

Executive power is also difficult to clearly define. In the British context, it was defined by John Locke as all government power not legislative or judicial in nature. The key distinction is that while legislative power involves setting down rules of general application, executive power involves applying those rules to specific situations. In practice, however, this definition is difficult to apply as many actions by executive agencies are wide-ranging, binding and conducted independently of Parliament. The executive can also be delegated legislative power through provisions allowing for statutory instruments and Henry VIII clauses. Ultimately whether power is executive or legislative is determined on a case-by-case basis, and involves the weighing up of various factors, rather than the application of a strict test.

As most executive power is granted by statute, the executive power of the government is similarly limited to those areas in which the Commonwealth is granted the power to legislate under the constitution (primarily under section 51). They also retain certain powers traditionally part of the royal prerogative, such as the power to declare war and enter into treaties. Finally, there exists certain &quot;nationhood powers&quot;, implied from section 61 of the Constitution. These were defined by High Court Justice Anthony Mason, as powers &quot;peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation and which cannot otherwise be carried on for the benefit of the nation&quot;. They have been found to include the power to provide financial stimulus payments to households during a financial crisis and the power to prevent &quot;unlawful non-citizens&quot; from entering the country.

==Ministers==
Ministers drawn from the Australian parliament form the core of the Australian Government. A subset of these ministers form the cabinet, the de facto highest executive body of the government. Ministers not part of cabinet belong to the outer ministry. Additionally, there are also assistant ministers (formally &quot;parliamentary secretaries&quot;), responsible for a specific policy area, reporting directly to a cabinet minister.

===Cabinet===

The cabinet consists of the prime minister and senior ministers and makes most of the important policy decisions of the government. Members of the cabinet are selected by the prime minister and may be added or removed at any time, usually through a cabinet reshuffle. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The cabinet is not a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the Federal Executive Council, which is Australia&#x27;s highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the cabinet. All members of the cabinet are members of the Executive Council. A senior member of the cabinet holds the office of vice-president of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the governor-general.

The cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in state capitals, most frequently Sydney and Melbourne. Kevin Rudd was in favour of the cabinet meeting in other places, such as major regional cities. There are Commonwealth Parliament Offices in each state capital, including the original Commonwealth Offices Building at 4 Treasury Place Melbourne, and the Commonwealth Parliament Offices, Sydney located in 1 Bligh Street.

Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the cabinet. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 Robert Menzies created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers holding cabinet rank, also known within parliament as the front bench. This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam government.

===Ministerial selection===

The prime minister&#x27;s power to select the ministry differs depending on their party. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party or its predecessor the Country Party, the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate their party&#x27;s members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the prime minister on the allocation of their portfolios.

When Labor first held office under Chris Watson, Watson assumed the right to choose members of his cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party (the Caucus), with the prime minister retaining the right to allocate portfolios. This practice was followed until 2007. Between 1907 and 2007, Labor prime ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence. However, in 2007 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd assumed the power to choose the ministry alone. Later, the caucus regained this power in 2013. According to reporting by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, ministerial positions are allocated by the Left and Right factions proportionally according to their representation in the Parliament.

==The role of the King and the governor-general==
The King is not involved with the day-to-day operations of the government, belonging (according to the Bagehot formulation) to the &quot;dignified&quot; rather than the &quot;efficient&quot; part of government. While the executive power of the Commonwealth is formally vested in the monarch, the Constitution requires those powers to be exercisable by a governor-general, appointed by the monarch as their representative (but since the appointing of Sir Isaac Isaacs in 1931, always appointed according to the advice of federal ministers, rather than British ministers). Members of the government do not exercise executive power of their own accord but are instead appointed by the governor-general as ministers, formally as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s [or King&#x27;s] Ministers of State&quot;. As such, while government ministers make most major decisions in cabinet, if those decisions require the formal endorsement of the governor-general in council, those decisions do not have legal force until approved by the Federal Executive Council, which is presided over by the governor-general.

Similarly, laws passed by both houses of parliament require royal assent before being enacted, as the monarch is a constituent part of the Parliament.

However, in all these cases, except for certain reserve powers, the King and the governor-general must follow the advice of the prime minister or other ministers in the exercise of his powers. Powers subject to the governor-general&#x27;s discretion are known as &quot;reserve powers.&quot; While certain reserve powers, such as the ability to choose the prime minister most likely to command the confidence of the lower house, are uncontroversial, others are subject to much greater debate. The most notable example of their use occurring in the Dismissal of 1975. In that case, the Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed the prime minister and government due to his conclusion that the government had failed to secure supply. The propriety of the use of the powers during that event remain highly contested.

== Federal Executive Council ==

The Federal Executive Council is the body that formally advises the governor-general in the exercise of executive power. Decisions of the body give legal effect to decisions already deliberated at cabinet. All current and formers ministers are members of the council, although only current ministers are summoned to meetings. The governor-general usually presides at council meetings, but in his or her absence another minister nominated as the vice-president of the Executive Council presides at the meeting of the council. Since 1 June 2022, the vice-president has been senator Katy Gallagher.

<text>George Richard Wilson Knight (1897–1985) was an English literary critic and academic, known particularly for his interpretation of mythic content in literature, and &quot;The Wheel of Fire&quot;, a collection of essays on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. He was also an actor and theatrical director, and considered an outstanding lecturer.

==Early life and education==
Knight was educated at Dean Close School, Dulwich College and, after serving as a dispatch rider in World War I in Iraq, India and Persia, he went up to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he read English. He graduated with second-class honours. After Oxford, he went into teaching. From 1923 to 1931 he taught at Hawtreys, Westgate-on-Sea and at Dean Close School, Cheltenham. 

The classical scholar William Francis Jackson Knight (1895–1964), of whom he wrote a biography, was his brother.

==Academic career==
Knight&#x27;s first academic post was at Trinity College, Toronto in 1931. He taught at Stowe School from 1941 to 1946. In 1946 he became a Reader in English Literature at the University of Leeds. He remained at Leeds as a Professor of English Literature from 1956 until his retirement in 1962.

At Toronto, Knight produced and acted in the main Shakespearian tragedies at Hart House Theatre. Among his other productions are &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Rudolf Steiner Theatre, London in 1935; &quot;This Sceptred Isle&quot; at the Westminster Theatre London in 1941; and at Leeds the &quot;Agamemnon&quot; of Aeschylus in 1946; Racine&#x27;s &quot;Athalie&quot; in 1947; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; in 1948.

In the assessment of Jim Walsh, who studied English at Leeds 1948–53 and later became the University&#x27;s registrar, in Walsh&#x27;s first year &quot;Wilson Knight dominated the scene as far as I and a lot of other students were concerned&quot;, but &quot;to be at close quarters with the man was quite different. He wore a brown sports jacket. Behind on the wall was a photograph of him as Timon of Athens in the production we had all seen — bare shoulders, wild hair and wild eyes. He spoke to us briefly about the course, but his eyes never met ours but seemed to focus entirely on this photograph. I began to feel extremely uncomfortable&quot;. A fellow student opined afterwards that &quot;he&#x27;s a nutter&quot;, with Walsh admitting that &quot;I was beginning to come to a conclusion something like that&quot;.

==Spiritualism==
Knight was a believer in spiritualism and was a vice-president for the Spiritualist Association of Great Britain.

<doc id="1222548" wikidata="Q4353991" url="?curid=1222548" title="Steve Kipner">
<text>Stephen Alan Kipner (born 1950) is an American-born Australian songwriter and record producer. He has produced a number of international hit songs such as Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot;, Natasha Bedingfield&#x27;s &quot;These Words&quot;, and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, for which he won an Ivor Novello Award for International Hit of the Year. Other hits he has writing credits on include Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;, 98 Degrees&#x27; &quot;The Hardest Thing&quot;, Dream&#x27;s &quot;He Loves U Not&quot;, Kelly Rowland&#x27;s &quot;Stole&quot;, The Script&#x27;s &quot;Breakeven&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Can&#x27;t Be Moved&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot; Kris Allen&#x27;s top 5 debut &quot;Live Like We&#x27;re Dying&quot;, Cheryl Cole&#x27;s &quot;Fight for This Love&quot;, Camila Cabello&#x27;s &quot;Crying in the Club&quot; and James Arthur&#x27;s &quot;Say You Won&#x27;t Let Go&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, Kipner began his music career in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, where he grew up.

===Steve &amp; the Board===
His first band, Steve &amp; the Board achieved Australian chart success with the song &quot;Giggle Eyed Goo&quot;, co-written by his father Nat Kipner and released on Spin Records in 1966. As a result of his father&#x27;s A&amp;R involvement in Spin Records, the members of Steve &amp; the Board became good friends with the Bee Gees, who were also on the label. Nat Kipner, interviewed in 2001, said that Steve Kipner sang backing vocals on some songs on the Bee Gees album &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; which was produced by Nat Kipner (Colin Petersen, the drummer of Steve &amp; the Board, also played on some songs on that album).

===Tin Tin and the Fut===
Steve &amp; the Board broke up in early 1967. Kipner then formed a duo with Steve Groves and relocated to England in 1968, where they recorded an unsuccessful LP as &quot;Steve &amp; Stevie&quot; on Toast Records. After Kipner ran into Barry Gibb in 1969, Kipner and Groves were signed to Robert Stigwood with Maurice Gibb as their producer. Under the name Tin Tin, the group scored an international hit, &quot;Toast and Marmalade for Tea&quot;, including an American top 20 placing in 1971. The next year Tin Tin, with additional member John Vallins, supported the Bee Gees on their American tour.

In August 1969, Kipner, Groves, Gibb, and Billy Lawrie recorded the song &quot;Have You Heard the Word&quot; in a Tin Tin session, with Kipner on piano and participating on the lead vocals with Groves and Gibb. Maurice Gibb&#x27;s vocal impersonation of John Lennon led to the song appearing on Beatles bootleg albums as supposedly a lost Beatles recording.

===Other bands===
Kipner moved from London to California in 1974 and was a member of the bands &quot;Friends&quot; (MGM), &quot;Skyband&quot; (RCA), and &quot;Think out Loud&quot; (A&amp;M). He then recorded the solo album &quot;Knock the Walls Down&quot; in 1979. While writing and recording for his own album, Kipner came into contact with other artists who developed an interest in his songs for their albums, and accidentally fell into a song-writing career as more and more opportunities arose.

At that time he met Australian manager Roger Davies, who in the late 1970s was working for Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s manager Lee Kramer. Kipner had co-written a song with English songwriter Terry Shaddick titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Physical,&quot; and played the demo to Davies, imagining the song would be suited to a male singer such as Rod Stewart. Kramer overheard the song from the next room and thought it would be a way to promote another one of his clients, Mr. Universe, by having him appear with Newton-John on her album cover. Retitled &quot;Physical&quot;, the song spent ten weeks at number 1 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and was a worldwide hit.

===Songwriting career===

&quot;Fight for This Love&quot; reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and was the fastest-selling single of 2009 with 292,846 sales in its first week.

&quot;Catch 22 (2 Steps Forward, 3 Steps Back)&quot; is Track 4 on the &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; soundtrack and performed by Kipner. &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; was the second movie John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John co-starred in after &quot;Grease&quot;.

&quot;Physical&quot; was ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2017 as the No. 8 song among all those which charted during the 50+ year history of the Hot 100.

In 1999, Christina Aguilera released &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;, written by Kipner, David Frank, and Pam Sheyne, which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Over the years, Kipner has written songs for some of the music industry&#x27;s biggest artists including Olly Murs, Doug Parkinson, Heart, Janet Jackson, Cher, Matsuda Seiko, Diana Ross, Neil Diamond, Laura Branigan, The Temptations, America, Cheap Trick, LFO, Westlife, Huey Lewis &amp; the News, Joe Cocker, Al Jarreau, Rod Stewart, and &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s David Archuleta from Season 7. Other &quot;Billboard&quot; charting songs include &quot;20/20&quot; by George Benson, &quot;Invisible Man&quot; by 98 Degrees, &quot;Potential New Boyfriend&quot; by Dolly Parton, &quot;Moonlight on Water&quot; by Laura Branigan, &quot;Heart Attack&quot;, &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; and &quot;I Need Love&quot; by Olivia Newton-John, and &quot;Impulsive&quot; by Wilson Phillips.
&quot;Nothin&#x27; You Can Do About It&quot; by The Manhattan Transfer (&quot;Extensions&quot;) written by David Foster, Jay Graydon, Steve Kipner (1979).

&quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; by Al Jarreau (&quot;High Crime&quot;) written by Steve Kipner, Paul Bliss (1984).

<text>Dunkirk is a 1958 British war film directed by Leslie Norman that depicts the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, and starring John Mills, Richard Attenborough, and Bernard Lee. The film is based on the novels &quot;The Big Pick-Up&quot; by Elleston Trevor and &quot;Dunkirk&quot; co-authored by Lt Col Ewan Butler and Major J. S. Bradford.

==Plot==
In 1940, English journalist Charles Foreman, in search of propaganda, strives to warn his complacent readers of the dangers posed by the build-up of German forces in western Europe. He rails against the Ministry of Information for suppressing the truth. Most of his compatriots, including his neighbour John Holden, have been lulled by the lack of significant fighting during the &quot;Phoney War&quot;. Holden owns a garage, with a profitable side-line manufacturing belt buckles for the British Army.

The Battle of France begins, and the Germans advance rapidly, trapping Allied forces along the Channel coast. Lieutenant Lumpkin, Corporal &quot;Tubby&quot; Binns and a handful of men of the British Expeditionary Force return from blowing up a bridge to find their division has withdrawn. The lieutenant speaks to a driver left behind for them, but both are killed in a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aerial attack before Binns can be apprised of the situation, leaving him in charge of four men, Privates Barlow, Bellman, Fraser and Russell, with no idea where their unit has gone. They witness an aerial attack on refugees and reach a Royal Artillery battery camp. Fraser is killed when the battery repulses a German tank force. The officer commanding the battery orders Binns to head north with his men and two stragglers, Privates Harper and Miles, and try to find their unit. Just after they leave, the battery is wiped out by Stuka dive bombers.

Meanwhile, the situation has become so desperate that BEF commander General Gort ignores orders to counterattack and instead positions his units for evacuation from Dunkirk. In England, Vice-Admiral Ramsay directs Operation Dynamo; the Admiralty begins commandeering all suitable civilian boats, including those owned by Foreman and Holden, to sail to Dunkirk to help evacuate troops from the beaches. The boats are marshalled at Sheerness. Foreman insists on taking his motorboat &quot;Vanity&quot; to Dunkirk himself, despite warnings of the danger. Other boat owners follow his example. After initial reluctance, Holden decides to take his boat &quot;Heron&quot; too, assisted by his teenage apprentice Frankie.

Binns and his men spend the night in an abandoned farmhouse, but at dawn, a German unit arrives; in the ensuing firefight, Bellman is badly wounded. The men escape, but Binns is forced to leave Bellman behind so he can receive medical attention. Later, after slipping past a German camp under cover of darkness, they stumble upon an RAF lorry, manned by Airmen Froome and Pannet, and go with them to Dunkirk, where Allied troops are being subjected to regular aerial bombing and strafing. Binns and his men manage to board a ship, only for it to be bombed as it departs; they are forced to jump overboard as it sinks. Their prospects of rescue are made worse by the Admiralty&#x27;s decision to withdraw its destroyers. Ramsay argues against the withdrawal, and the Admiralty reluctantly agrees to send them back.

Foreman and Holden ferry many soldiers to the larger vessels, but Foreman&#x27;s boat is sunk by a bomber, killing Joe. Foreman is picked up by Holden. With harbour operations no longer possible, thousands of Allied troops gather on the beaches. In the next attack, Barlow is wounded and taken to an aid station. &quot;Heron&quot;″s engine breaks down just off the beach. While Russell, a motor mechanic in civilian life, effects repairs, Foreman and Frankie go ashore to survey the scene. Next day, during church parade, Foreman is killed in an aerial attack. Russell completes his repairs, and Binns&#x27; group and six more soldiers board. Holden sets sail for home. At sea, the engine breaks down again and the boat drifts towards the German-held port of Calais. Fortunately, they are spotted by a destroyer and taken back to England.

==Production==
Owners of small boats were tracked down for production and the cast featured genuine army officers. Approximately twenty minutes was cut for the U.S. release. Popular wartime British music hall performers Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen portray themselves, performing &quot;We’re Going to Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line.&quot; The film was shot on location in France and at M-G-M&#x27;s British Studios. Stock footage is used from &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; (1953) to show a destroyer being sunk at the mole. 
Beach sequences were shot at Camber Sands near Rye, East Sussex, and Dunkirk town centre was recreated using part of Rye Harbour. A canal-type bridge was temporarily constructed over the upper harbour, leading on to the quayside. It was over this bridge that the refugees and troops poured into the &quot;town centre&quot;. Several scenes take place at this location, particularly a tracking shot following two British Army officers as they discuss the situation. In the background, the viewer can make out Rye Church and some old warehouses, still extant, albeit in much restored condition. One of the warehouses was used as the interior for the &quot;Barn Scene&quot;. Tibbs Farmhouse, Udimore was used for the scene of the soldiers taking refuge in a French Farmhouse. The scene where the bridge was blown during the early part of the film was on the River Medway at Teston Bridge, Teston in Kent.

Director Leslie Norman later recalled:

&quot;Dunkirk&quot; was bloody difficult to make from a logistics point of view. Yet it was made for £400,000 and came in under budget... I was the council school boy who became a major in the war, and that had a lot to do with the way I felt about Dunkirk. I didn&#x27;t think that Dunkirk was a defeat; I always thought it was a very gallant effort but not a victory.

The musical score is by Malcolm Arnold, which may account for the fact that many of its segments sound very much like his Academy Award-winning theme from &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, made the previous year (1957), or &quot;Heroes of Telemark&quot; (1965).

==Reception==
The world premiere was at the Empire, Leicester Square, in London on 20 March 1958.

===Box office===
The film was the third most popular production at the British box office in 1958, after &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; and &quot;The Vikings&quot;. (Other accounts say it was the second, making $1,750,000.)

According to MGM records it earned only $310,000 in the US and Canada but $1,750,000 elsewhere; after distribution costs were deducted MGM earned a profit of $371,000. Michael Balcon admitted the film did not do well in the US but it &quot;did wonderfully well in other parts of the world.&quot;

===Critical===
Bosley Crowther, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review, praised the performances of the leads and supporting cast.

Later reviews give positive to mixed feelings on the film. A review for &quot;The Movie Scene&quot; gave the film three out of five stars, praising the performances of the leads, and the effects. Nerdly.co.uk notes the film has &quot;a level of authenticity that is surprisingly truthful, even about the mishandling of events by the British&quot;. The critic Derek Winnert noted that the film was &quot;long, ambitious, engrossing, intelligent and informative film, and not nearly as celebrated as it should be.&quot;

A review for The Spinning Image noted that &quot;while it was a hit in its day and went onto be a staple of television broadcasts for many years, you can&#x27;t but mention it was overshadowed by Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Dunkirk in 2017 which applied twenty-first century techniques to a nineteen-forties plot and was one of the biggest movies of the twenty-tens, but the &#x27;58 version had a power of its own, and should not be dismissed.&quot; Another reviewer said that the film &quot;pales beside Nolan’s film, but in many respects, it more accurately reflects the British attitude in the immediate post-World War II period and is a good complement to it.&quot;

<text>Curdled is a 1996 black comedy crime film written and directed by Reb Braddock. The film stars Angela Jones as a Colombian immigrant who takes a crime scene cleanup job and discovers evidence about a local serial killer dubbed the &quot;Blue Blood Killer&quot; for his targeting of socialites. The film is a remake of a 1991 short film of the same name, which was also directed by Braddock and starred Jones.

==Plot==
Gabriela is a Colombian immigrant living in Miami who has been fascinated with violent death ever since she saw a falling corpse pass by her mother&#x27;s bakery window as a child. With many television shows and films feeding her obsession, she believes that after someone is decapitated, they still talk for a short while afterwards.

Having quit her job at a bakery, she begins work for a cleaning service, after she sees a television commercial advertising it. The service is headed by a man named Lodger, who specializes in mopping up what is left behind at crime scenes. She goes to the office, inquires about a job and later is (to the dismay of Elena, her cleaning partner) offered the opportunity to clean up after an execution by her favorite at-large serial killer, The Blue Blood Killer (so named because his victims are all wealthy women).

The two women go to the scene of the crime and begin cleaning up the mess. Elena diligently works away, trying to get out of there as soon as possible; meanwhile Gabriela discovers what she believes to be the name of the serial killer - &quot;Paul Guell&quot; - beneath a pool of blood, but covers it up so that Elena won&#x27;t see and think she is weird. Due to the amount of blood, they have to leave and come back the next day.

While out on a date with ex-colleague Eduardo, Gabriela reveals to him what she found out and after failing to clearly explain, convinces him to go to the house that same night, before it all gets cleaned up.

Unbeknown to Gabriela and Eduardo, the killer is still in the building after accidentally locking himself in the wine cellar while trying to escape. Gabriela opens the door to the cellar, when Eduardo freaks out and decides he wants to go, leaving the door ajar and the killer an escape route. Eduardo leaves when Gabriela refuses to go with him, and she picks up a knife, dancing around the house where the blood is, acting out what she thinks happened - all while the killer watches.

When Eduardo returns after a second thought, the killer hits him over the head and hides him in the wine cellar. He soon stops Gabriela and forces her to walk him through what happened, checking that she knows the full story, and when they come to the end, they briefly argue about Gabriela&#x27;s theory of heads talking after decapitation. The killer then decides it&#x27;s time for Gabriela to die, but in a struggle, he slips and is knocked out on the tiled floor.

When he begins to come to, Gabriela, out of sheer curiosity, picks up the knife and cuts his head off. She slowly lifts up his head and he mumbles her name, to which Gabriela smiles with satisfaction.

In a post-credits scene, Gabriela and Eduardo are driving in a car and Gabriela plays the tape which recorded the killer&#x27;s last word after beheading.

==Cast==
==Connection to &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;==
&quot;Curdled&quot; would appear to be set in the same universe as the vampire action film &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;. Kelly Preston reprises the character of newscaster Kelly Hogue, giving a news report about the &quot;missing&quot; Gecko brothers. Tarantino, who wrote and co-starred in &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;, executive produced this film and briefly appears as Richie Gecko in archive footage.

==Critical reception==
The film received generally negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 17% based on reviews from 12 critics, and average rating of 4.70/10.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, saying that the film &quot;is not very interesting&quot;, but praised Jones&#x27; ability to play &quot;a tricky role with the right note of deadpan delight&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot;, said that Jones &quot;manages to hold viewer interest throughout with a devilishly witty turn... despite having desperately little to work with&quot;.

<doc id="1222562" wikidata="Q3490056" url="?curid=1222562" title="Luis Palau">
<text>Luis Palau Jr. (November 27, 1934 – March 11, 2021) was an Argentine-American international Christian evangelist. He was born in Argentina but moved to Portland, Oregon, in his mid-twenties to enroll in a graduate program in Biblical studies.

Palau had a long and close relationship with evangelist Billy Graham, and was characterized by many as Graham&#x27;s successor. &quot;One of the world’s leading evangelical Christian figures,&quot; he was known for his strong appeal to young people, and for his efforts to reach out to secular leaders to address issues like homelessness.

In 2007, Palau was estimated to have shared the message of Jesus Christ with 25 million people in 70 nations. Palau&#x27;s ministry employs 70 people in their headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, and another 25 around the world which include offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina and London.

In 2018, Palau shared on Facebook and YouTube that he had stage-four lung cancer; he died in March 2021.

==Early life==
Luis Palau Jr. was born November 27, 1934, in Maschwitz, Buenos Aires, Argentina. He has five younger sisters and one brother. His father, a construction executive, died when Palau was 10. Within a matter of years after his father&#x27;s death, because of poor financial management by relatives, Palau, his siblings, and his widowed mother were left nearly destitute. Palau was forced to leave his education at a British-run boarding school and began working as the sole provider for the family at a bank in Córdoba, Argentina.

Palau says that he was born again at the age of 12, devoting his life to Christ. He first heard Billy Graham on a radio broadcast from Portland, Oregon, while still living in Argentina in 1950, and drew inspiration from him. He later worked for Graham as a Spanish translator and as an evangelist. In 1970, Graham contributed the seed money for Palau to start his own ministry, which he modeled after Graham&#x27;s.

Since then, Palau held many large-scale evangelistic festivals and gatherings around the world.

==Settling in Oregon==
Palau arrived in Portland in 1960 to attend a graduate program at Multnomah Bible College, from which he graduated in 1961. His travel and tuition was paid by U.S. benefactors. There he met his wife, Pat, a Beaverton kindergarten teacher, who was a fellow student. They married in 1961 and settled in Cedar Mill, an unincorporated area of the Portland metropolitan area just north of Beaverton. They would go on to have four children: Kevin, Keith, Andrew, and Stephen Palau. He became a U.S. citizen in 1962. The Palaus spent the next eight years serving as missionaries in Mexico and Colombia, before returning to Oregon. After receiving $100,000 as seed money in 1970 from Billy Graham, in quarterly payments of $25,000, Palau worked to build up his ministry in Oregon through the 1970s. 

In 1975, Palau shared the Bible Expositor post at Eurofest &#x27;75 with Bishop Festo Kivengere. Eurofest &#x27;75 was co-sponsored by the Billy Graham organisation and was held in Brussels, Belgium, at the Palais du Centenaire and the Heysel Stadium from July 24 until August 2, 1975. In October 1978, the Luis Palau Evangelistic Association, based in Beaverton, was incorporated.

==Growing local popularity and secular service==

In 1999, a writeup in a Portland weekly newspaper noted that Palau had assembled an 80,000-member audience in &quot;the nation&#x27;s least-churched major city.&quot; It also noted the contrast with the previous large revival, led by an aging Graham, which drew larger numbers but not as many young people as Palau&#x27;s. Media coverage of Palau&#x27;s event mentioned Palau as a potential successor to Graham. The annual budget of his ministry was estimated that year at $6 million.

His ministry, the Luis Palau Evangelical Association, continued to be based in nearby Beaverton as of 2003. Three of his four sons were working for his ministry at that time.

As of 2003, Palau hosted three daily radio programs: an English show carried by 900 stations in 23 countries, and two Spanish programs carried by 880 stations in 25 countries. In that year he was noted for being &quot;at the forefront of efforts to make evangelism more active, contemporary and accessible to a younger audience,&quot; and his ministry&#x27;s annual budget was estimated at $11 million.

In August 2003, Palau mobilized several thousand volunteers from numerous churches to &quot;spruce up&quot; local public schools.

In November 2005, Palau visited China, wrapping up a week-long visit by attending a Beijing church service along with U.S. President George W. Bush.
He launched a book venture after holding a conversation with a former government Chinese official during his trip to Beijing; Palau launched a book venture based on the transcribed work. The book, now published by Zondervan, is entitled &quot;A Friendly Dialogue Between An Atheist and a Christian.&quot;

Palau made a point of staying out of politics, refusing to endorse ballot measures or candidates. Recently he has partnered with secular leaders as well. Portland Mayor Vera Katz did not attend his first big Portland event in 1999, but her successor, Tom Potter, who is not a churchgoer, approached Palau at a 2005 Portland appearance by First Lady Laura Bush. Potter asked for Palau&#x27;s assistance in getting other evangelical leaders to address Portland&#x27;s homelessness problems.

Palau got in touch with fellow evangelicals, and cooperated with Portland Commissioner Erik Sten, Potter, Beaverton Mayor Rob Drake, and Gresham Mayor Shane Bemis in 2008 in planning his August 22–23 festival, which focused on volunteerism in support of the homeless. Palau&#x27;s last Portland event drew about 140,000 people over two days. Palau addressed 500 Christian pastors in March 2008, joined by Portland City Commissioner Sam Adams, in the buildup to the August event. He calls the effort the &quot;Season of Service&quot;.

In 2013, Palau was residing in Cedar Mill, but in late 2018 was residing in nearby Bethany, another unincorporated area also north of Beaverton and immediately west of Cedar Mill. A November 2018 article in the &quot;Beaverton Valley Times&quot; referred to the Cedar Mill Bible Church as Palau&#x27;s &quot;home base&quot;.

In 2015, Palau hosted CityFest, an evangelistic event in New York City that drew 60,000 people to Central Park. This was a year-long effort that involved over 1,700 churches.

==Illness and death==
On January 17, 2018, Palau shared on Facebook and YouTube that he had stage-four lung cancer. In late November 2018, he told a reporter for the &quot;Beaverton Valley Times&quot; that his cancer had &quot;stabilized for now&quot;. His health worsened in early 2021, however, leading to hospitalization in February and a subsequent decision to discontinue treatment.

On March 11, 2021, Palau died of lung cancer, in his home, surrounded by family. He was 86.

==Works==
Palau wrote numerous books including:
* &quot;Where Is God When Bad Things Happen?&quot; 
* &quot;Calling America and the Nations to Christ&quot; 
* &quot;God is Relevant&quot; 
* &quot;High Definition Life&quot; 
* &quot;A Friendly Dialogue between an Atheist and a Christian&quot; 

==Movie==
A film entitled &quot;Palau the Movie&quot; was released in 2019. It tells the story of Palau&#x27;s life and ministry. Starring Gastón Pauls and Alexia Moyano, the film is in color and is 117 minutes long.

<doc id="1222564" wikidata="Q2517431" url="?curid=1222564" title="Girl 6">
<text>Girl 6 is a 1996 American black comedy film produced and directed by Spike Lee. The film stars Theresa Randle, Isaiah Washington, and Lee. Suzan-Lori Parks wrote the screenplay, making it the first film directed by Lee that he did not also write. Directors Quentin Tarantino and Ron Silver make cameo appearances as film directors at a pair of auditions.

The accompanying soundtrack is composed entirely of songs written by Prince. The film was screened in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
Judy, a young and timid African-American aspiring actress living in New York City, attends an audition with Quentin Tarantino for what he describes as &quot;the greatest romantic, African-American film ever made&quot;. Judy grows apprehensive when asked to expose her breasts, as the role requires nudity. She reluctantly complies, but feeling uneasy, she storms out of the audition.

Afterwards, Judy&#x27;s agent Murray, having worked hard to get her an audition with such a prestigious director, furiously drops her from his roster of clients. Her melodramatic acting coach also criticizes her apathy towards her acting art and the entertainment industry overall, insisting that Judy should have simply followed Tarantino&#x27;s directions. This, coupled with Judy&#x27;s financial issues preventing her from paying her coach for her services, results in Judy being dropped from her roster of clients as well.

Now unable to secure regular acting work, Judy tries various jobs. She comes across newspaper classified advertisements for a &quot;friendly phone line&quot; and another with the headline &quot;mo&#x27; money, mo&#x27; money, mo&#x27; money&quot;, circling both. At a call center specializing in customer service and phone sex, Judy has an interview with Lil, who is assertive but friendly. Judy then attends interviews with other phone sex companies, including one run by a stripper, who offers her the opportunity to work unrestricted in her own home. However, the job would require her to have own private telephone line, which she currently does not have. She decides to keep this opportunity in mind for future reference.

Ultimately, Lil hires Judy as a phone sex operator at the call center. During orientation, Lil explains that although most women on the team are African-American, they should always pretend to be Caucasian, unless the caller requests otherwise. Under the moniker &quot;Girl 6&quot;, Judy immediately settles into her new job. Her sports memorabilia-obsessed cousin and best friend Jimmy, who lives in the same apartment complex as her, worries that her new job might distract her from her acting career. While running errands, Judy occasionally sees her kleptomaniac ex-husband, explaining her current occupation.

Thanks to her new job, Judy has become more confident and uninhibited. She bonds with &quot;Bob Regular&quot;, a caller from Arizona who requests her specifically; Judy adopts the nickname &quot;Lovely&quot; especially for him. Unlike other callers, Bob has friendly, platonic conversations with her, mostly about his ailing mother. When Bob tells Judy he is visiting New York on business, they agree to meet in person at Coney Island during her lunch break. As Judy anxiously waits for Bob, a man walks past her; believing the man to be Bob, she calls out to him, but he does not respond. Despondent, Judy leaves.

Shortly after returning to work, Judy receives a disturbing call from a verbally abusive man. Lil, monitoring her call, disconnects him and reminds her to be more careful with the men that call in. Nevertheless, the man reconnects to Judy&#x27;s line, further harassing her. Judy&#x27;s job gradually begins to affect her mental health. Noticing Judy&#x27;s exhaustion, Lil places her on leave so she can rest. Judy, however, now able to obtain a private line, decides to continue her phone sex career at home. She devotes herself fully to her job, ignoring Jimmy&#x27;s and her ex-husband&#x27;s attempts to contact her.

One night, Judy engages in a conversation with a sadistic caller who discusses his fantasy of strangling her, soon realizing he is the same abusive man who previously harassed her. As he reveals that he knows her address, she suffers a breakdown and lashes out at him, much to his delight. Terrified, she runs upstairs to Jimmy&#x27;s apartment for protection. Judy tells Jimmy she has decided to abandon her phone sex career and move to Los Angeles to resume her acting career. Before leaving, she makes amends with her ex-husband.

In Los Angeles, Judy attends an audition with Ron Silver who, like Tarantino, asks her to bare her breasts. This time, however, she stands up for herself and leaves the audition. Walking down the Hollywood Walk of Fame, she crosses the street towards Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, which is showing the film &quot;Girl 6&quot;.

==Cast==
==Soundtrack==
==Home media==
The film was released on VHS on August 6, 1996, and on DVD on March 7, 2006.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $4,939,939 domestically.

===Critical response===
&quot;Girl 6&quot; received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 39% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Girl 6&quot; has a compelling star, a Prince soundtrack, and Spike Lee&#x27;s vivid style – and, unfortunately, a story that&#x27;s never as compelling or insightful as it needs to be.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and said, &quot;Even though Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Girl 6&quot; was written by a woman, it seems conceived from the point of view of a male caller, who would like to believe that the woman he&#x27;s hiring by the minute is enjoying their conversation just as much as he is.&quot; He added the film&#x27;s central problem is, &quot;It&#x27;s about a woman exposing herself for male entertainment, even though it pretends to be about men exposing themselves for female employment.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more positive, writing, &quot;Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Girl 6&quot; doesn&#x27;t reveal much about its title character, but it does make this clear: Mr. Lee adores her. He shows his fondness for this beautiful heroine (Theresa Randle) by surrounding her with every bit of fun and flattery in his considerable arsenal. Bold colors, a dance track of Prince songs, a parade of wild costumes, good-humored sexual teasing and warmly inviting cinematography by Malik Sayeed all contribute to this comedy&#x27;s high-energy party mood.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; said the film lacks &quot;meaningful insight into Girl 6&#x27;s character&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Peter Travers commented Lee has &quot;sucked the fun out of call-in sex and replaced it with sanctimonious prattle&quot;.

<text>The Helmholtz machine (named after Hermann von Helmholtz and his concept of Helmholtz free energy) is a type of artificial neural network that can account for the hidden structure of a set of data by being trained to create a generative model of the original set of data. The hope is that by learning economical representations of the data, the underlying structure of the generative model should reasonably approximate the hidden structure of the data set. A Helmholtz machine contains two networks, a bottom-up &quot;recognition&quot; network that takes the data as input and produces a distribution over hidden variables, and a top-down &quot;generative&quot; network that generates values of the hidden variables and the data itself. At the time, Helmholtz machines were one of a handful of learning architectures that used feedback as well as feedforward to ensure quality of learned models.

Helmholtz machines are usually trained using an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as the wake-sleep algorithm. They are a precursor to variational autoencoders, which are instead trained using backpropagation. Helmholtz machines may also be used in applications requiring a supervised learning algorithm (e.g. character recognition, or position-invariant recognition of an object within a field).

<text>Western Springs is a residential suburb in the city of Auckland in the north of New Zealand. It is located four kilometres to the west of the city centre, Auckland CBD. The park is situated to the north of State Highway 16 and the residential suburb is located southeast of the park on the opposite side of State Highway 16.

The suburb is dominated by Western Springs Reserve, also known as Western Springs Lakeside Te Wai Ōrea, which features a lake with a variety of birdlife. Auckland Zoo, Western Springs Stadium and M.O.T.A.T. (the Museum of Transport and Technology) are situated around the park. The park is the location of the annual Pasifika Festival, one of Auckland&#x27;s most popular public events. Across the road from the zoo is the school of Western Springs College, with a student population of around .

==History==

=== Māori history ===
Historically, Māori valued the wetlands they named &quot;Te Wai Ōrea,&quot; meaning &#x27;the waters of eels&#x27;, for the clean, clear spring water and &quot;ōrea&quot; or New Zealand long fin eels that lived in the stream. A traditional Māori story involves Ruarangi, a chief of the supernatural Patupaiarehe people, escaping a siege on Owairaka / Mount Albert through lava tunnels and emerging at Te Wai Ōrea.

During a battle fought in the area, Kawharu, a Manukau Māori warrior chief, fought local &quot;iwi&quot; at a ridge site overlooking Te Wai Ōrea named &quot;Te Raeokawharu&quot; (Kawharu’s brow), where Surrey Crescent is situated today.

=== Post-European arrival ===
In 1830-40, during the Māori musket wars, Ngati Tahinga, Waiohua and Te Taou lived in the wider area, which was named &quot;Te Rehu&quot;.

After European colonisation, the area became part of a block of land farmed by William Motion, a Scottish settler. Colonists named the area Western Springs to differentiate it from the springs in Pukekawa / Auckland Domain to the east of the town.

==== Water spring use ====
The main source of the water that feeds the lake at Western Springs is rain falling on the slopes of the volcanoes Te Tātua a Riukiuta, Ōwairaka / Mount Albert and Maungawhau / Mount Eden. The water runs underground for several miles through the lava flows, and emerges from the ground at a constant rate that is well filtered by the miles of scoria rocks.

As Auckland grew over the mid-1800s, city officials found that well water was no longer sufficient at supplying the burgeoning population. In the 1860s, a pipe from the Auckland Domain Springs was constructed, but a more permanent solution was required to service the growing demand. In 1874, the council tasked Australian civil engineer Edward Orpen Moriarty with the task of supplying Auckland with water from Western Springs. The city bought William Motion&#x27;s mill and 120 acres (486,000 m2) of land, including the spring. In 1875, the swampy ground was made into a 15-acre (6ha) artificial lake 6 feet in depth and capable of holding 22 million gallons of water. Over the course of its construction, workers removed 20,000 cartloads of spoil from the site, and used 7,850 cubic yards of earth to construct the embankment which was wide at the base and wide at the crest. They also excavated the deep Engine Pond and dug a long tunnel between the lake and the Engine House.A pumphouse, which opened in 1877, was designed by City Engineer William Errington and built of brick. It was fitted with a steam engine, known as a beam engine, which is still in working order having been restored. The engine pumped water up to the two new reservoirs; one on the corner of Ponsonby Road and Karangahape Road, and the other in the block bordered by Khyber Pass Road, Symonds Street, Mount Eden Road, and Burleigh Street from where the water was gravity fed down to the city.
The cost of running and maintaining the pump was high however, and by the end of the 19th century Auckland&#x27;s size required a much greater and more reliable source of freshwater, coinciding with public pressure to safeguard the remaining native forests of the Waitākere Ranges west of the city. Auckland City purchased land and built large reservoirs in this secluded area, thus safeguarding both the water quality and the flora &amp; fauna of the area. The height of the reservoirs above sea level meant pumping was kept to a minimum as the water could be gravity fed downwards to the city. Use of the pumphouse ceased in 1936 after the Waitākere Ranges dams were completed.

=== Later development ===
From the early 1920s onwards various developments around Western Springs took place; The Auckland City Council Zoological Gardens were established to the north of the lake. To the west, around the corner of Motions Road and Great North Road, a camping ground was set up which was later converted into a transit camp for American servicemen during World War II. To the south of the lake, the Chamberlain Park Golf Club was established, and to the west, land was set aside for primary, intermediate and secondary schools to service the growing suburbs of Westmere and Point Chevalier.

The closure of the pumphouse left the inner Western Springs area with no specific use. Its often rough and uneven land was unsuitable for housing, as apart from the lake it contained large stretches of boggy ground. Unable to divest itself of the land, the Auckland City Council was at a loss what to do with it. Some light industry and market gardens were developed along Great North Road and Chinaman&#x27;s Hill, named due to the pre-dominantly Chinese market gardeners, and an attempt was made to convert the boggy land around the lake into a park. However, over the next three decades much of the land deteriorated as it became overgrown and used for illegal rubbish dumping.

The council used some of the more usable land to construct council housing in the 1920s, and in the 1930s sold much of the land previously used for market gardens to the government for state housing. To the north of the zoo was an area of mangrove swamp where the Western Springs creek reached the sea near the Meola Reef lava outcrop. This was utilised as a landfill dump and hence reclaimed during the 1950s and 1960s. The reclaimed land was developed as playing fields and an additional area for the MOTAT Sir Keith Park Memorial Airfield, and serves as the site of the Westpoint Performing Arts Center. In the 2000s the landfill was found to be emitting methane gas and was subsequently capped with clay.

After the war, the population of the surrounding suburbs grew markedly and it became obvious that the untidy state of Western Springs was an embarrassment. As a wilderness of bogs full of rubbish, rats and mosquitoes, it was unattractive and a potential health hazard. In 1961 the Auckland City Council embarked on developing the park in earnest. The lake, which had become completely choked by introduced waterweed was reclaimed, and the overgrown landscape was carefully cleared of weeds and rubbish.

In 1953 a plan was put forward to use the area around the lake as an amusement park with a scenic railway, fairground and rollercoasters, but this was soon discovered to be beyond the financial capabilities of Auckland City Council. In 1964 the Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) was established to the south-east of the lake, the old pumphouse forming its centrepiece.

By the 1980s major landscaping work had transformed the area from a former dumpsite into one of Auckland&#x27;s most attractive parks. New plantings were introduced to complement the mature trees from the 19th century, and careful planting of the islands in the lake and its surrounding wetlands have made it a successful breeding ground for a large variety of native and exotic waterfowl. Artworks by several New Zealand sculptors were installed in the park during the 1980s and 1990s.

<text>My Best Friend&#x27;s Birthday is an unfinished 1987 amateur comedy film directed, edited, co-written, co-produced by and starring Quentin Tarantino. The film was shot in black-and-white and was originally meant to have a runtime of seventy minutes, but only 36 minutes of the film are edited altogether, leaving the project unfinished.

== Plot ==
It’s Mickey’s birthday, and his girlfriend just left him. His friend Clarence shows up to give him a birthday he&#x27;ll never forget.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was made while Tarantino was working at the Video Archives, now closed, in Manhattan Beach, California. The project started in 1984, when Hamann wrote a short 30- to 40-page script.

Tarantino became attached to the project as co-writer and director, and he and Hamann expanded the script to 80 pages. On an estimated budget of $5,000, the film was originally planned in a Super 8mm format. However, when Tarantino was able to borrow a 16mm camera from film director Fred Olen Ray, the film was shot in 16mm over the course of the next four years. Hamann and Tarantino starred in the film, along with several video store and acting class buddies, and worked on the crew, which included fellow Video Archives employees Rand Vossler and Roger Avary. It is the most overtly comedic film that Tarantino has made. In an interview with Charlie Rose (available on the Region 1 Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;), he referred to it as a &quot;Martin and Lewis kind of thing.&quot;

It was long alleged that the original cut was about 70 minutes long, but due to a film lab fire, only 36 minutes of the film still exist. In 2019, a book titled &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Birthday: The Making of a Quentin Tarantino Film&quot;, written by Andrew J. Rausch, was published by BearManor Media. The book features interviews with all of the film&#x27;s principal personnel, including Quentin Tarantino, Craig Hamann, and Roger Avary. In the book, it is revealed the fire story was fabricated, with Tarantino choosing not to dismiss it as he thought it sounded interesting. In actuality, some rolls of film were simply discarded by mistake, and Tarantino, unsatisfied with the final product, edited together the scenes he liked, leaving the project unfinished. However, he has not dismissed the possibility of restoring and completing the film one day. The surviving footage has been edited together and shown at several film festivals.

<text>In statistical classification, two main approaches are called the generative approach and the discriminative approach. These compute classifiers by different approaches, differing in the degree of statistical modelling. Terminology is inconsistent, but three major types can be distinguished, following :
# A generative model is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution formula_1 on a given observable variable &quot;X&quot; and target variable &quot;Y&quot;; A generative model can be used to &quot;generate&quot; random instances (outcomes) of an observation &quot;x&quot;.
# A [[discriminative model]] is a model of the conditional probability formula_2 of the target &quot;Y&quot;, given an observation &quot;x&quot;. It can be used to &quot;discriminate&quot; the value of the target variable &quot;Y&quot;, given an observation &quot;x&quot;.
# Classifiers computed without using a probability model are also referred to loosely as &quot;discriminative&quot;.
The distinction between these last two classes is not consistently made; refers to these three classes as &quot;generative learning&quot;, &quot;conditional learning&quot;, and &quot;discriminative learning&quot;, but only distinguish two classes, calling them generative classifiers (joint distribution) and discriminative classifiers (conditional distribution or no distribution), not distinguishing between the latter two classes. Analogously, a classifier based on a generative model is a generative classifier, while a classifier based on a discriminative model is a discriminative classifier, though this term also refers to classifiers that are not based on a model.

Standard examples of each, all of which are linear classifiers, are:

* generative classifiers: 
** naive Bayes classifier and 
** linear discriminant analysis
* discriminative model: 
** logistic regression

In application to classification, one wishes to go from an observation &quot;x&quot; to a label &quot;y&quot; (or probability distribution on labels). One can compute this directly, without using a probability distribution (&quot;distribution-free classifier&quot;); one can estimate the probability of a label given an observation, formula_3 (&quot;discriminative model&quot;), and base classification on that; or one can estimate the joint distribution formula_1 (&quot;generative model&quot;), from that compute the conditional probability formula_3, and then base classification on that. These are increasingly indirect, but increasingly probabilistic, allowing more domain knowledge and probability theory to be applied. In practice different approaches are used, depending on the particular problem, and hybrids can combine strengths of multiple approaches.

== Definition ==
An alternative division defines these symmetrically as:

* a generative model is a model of the conditional probability of the observable &quot;X&quot;, given a target &quot;y&quot;, symbolically, formula_6
* a discriminative model is a model of the conditional probability of the target &quot;Y&quot;, given an observation &quot;x&quot;, symbolically, formula_2

Regardless of precise definition, the terminology is constitutional because a generative model can be used to &quot;generate&quot; random instances (outcomes), either of an observation and target formula_8, or of an observation &quot;x&quot; given a target value &quot;y&quot;, while a discriminative model or discriminative classifier (without a model) can be used to &quot;discriminate&quot; the value of the target variable &quot;Y&quot;, given an observation &quot;x&quot;. The difference between &quot;&quot; (distinguish) and &quot;&quot; is subtle, and these are not consistently distinguished. (The term &quot;discriminative classifier&quot; becomes a pleonasm when &quot;discrimination&quot; is equivalent to &quot;classification&quot;.)

The term &quot;generative model&quot; is also used to describe models that generate instances of output variables in a way that has no clear relationship to probability distributions over potential samples of input variables. Generative adversarial networks are examples of this class of generative models, and are judged primarily by the similarity of particular outputs to potential inputs. Such models are not classifiers.

=== Relationships between models ===
In application to classification, the observable &quot;X&quot; is frequently a continuous variable, the target &quot;Y&quot; is generally a discrete variable consisting of a finite set of labels, and the conditional probability formula_9 can also be interpreted as a (non-deterministic) target function formula_10, considering &quot;X&quot; as inputs and &quot;Y&quot; as outputs.

Given a finite set of labels, the two definitions of &quot;generative model&quot; are closely related. A model of the conditional distribution formula_6 is a model of the distribution of each label, and a model of the joint distribution is equivalent to a model of the distribution of label values formula_12, together with the distribution of observations given a label, formula_13; symbolically, formula_14 Thus, while a model of the joint probability distribution is more informative than a model of the distribution of label (but without their relative frequencies), it is a relatively small step, hence these are not always distinguished.

Given a model of the joint distribution, formula_1, the distribution of the individual variables can be computed as the marginal distributions formula_16 and formula_17 (considering &quot;X&quot; as continuous, hence integrating over it, and &quot;Y&quot; as discrete, hence summing over it), and either conditional distribution can be computed from the definition of conditional probability: formula_18 and formula_19.

Given a model of one conditional probability, and estimated probability distributions for the variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, denoted formula_20 and formula_12, one can estimate the opposite conditional probability using Bayes&#x27; rule:
:formula_22
For example, given a generative model for formula_13, one can estimate:
:formula_24
and given a discriminative model for formula_9, one can estimate:
:formula_26
Note that Bayes&#x27; rule (computing one conditional probability in terms of the other) and the definition of conditional probability (computing conditional probability in terms of the joint distribution) are frequently conflated as well.

==Contrast with discriminative classifiers==
A generative algorithm models how the data was generated in order to categorize a signal. It asks the question: based on my generation assumptions, which category is most likely to generate this signal? A discriminative algorithm does not care about how the data was generated, it simply categorizes a given signal. So, discriminative algorithms try to learn formula_27 directly from the data and then try to classify data. On the other hand, generative algorithms try to learn formula_28 which can be transformed into formula_27 later to classify the data. One of the advantages of generative algorithms is that you can use formula_28 to generate new data similar to existing data. On the other hand, it has been proved that some discriminative algorithms give better performance than some generative algorithms in classification tasks.

Despite the fact that discriminative models do not need to model the distribution of the observed variables, they cannot generally express complex relationships between the observed and target variables. But in general, they don&#x27;t necessarily perform better than generative models at classification and regression tasks. The two classes are seen as complementary or as different views of the same procedure.

== Deep generative models ==
With the rise of deep learning, a new family of methods, called deep generative models (DGMs), is formed through the combination of generative models and deep neural networks. An increase in the scale of the neural networks is typically accompanied by an increase in the scale of the training data, both of which are required for good performance.

Popular DGMs include variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and auto-regressive models. Recently, there has been a trend to build very large deep generative models. For example, GPT-3, and its precursor GPT-2, are auto-regressive neural language models that contain billions of parameters, BigGAN and VQ-VAE which are used for image generation that can have hundreds of millions of parameters, and Jukebox is a very large generative model for musical audio that contains billions of parameters.

== Types ==

=== Generative models ===

Types of generative models are:

* Gaussian mixture model (and other types of mixture model)
* Hidden Markov model
* Probabilistic context-free grammar
* Bayesian network (e.g. Naive bayes, Autoregressive model)
* Averaged one-dependence estimators
* Latent Dirichlet allocation
* Boltzmann machine (e.g. Restricted Boltzmann machine, Deep belief network)
* Variational autoencoder
* Generative adversarial network
* Flow-based generative model
* Energy based model
* Diffusion model

If the observed data are truly sampled from the generative model, then fitting the parameters of the generative model to maximize the data likelihood is a common method. However, since most statistical models are only approximations to the &quot;true&quot; distribution, if the model&#x27;s application is to infer about a subset of variables conditional on known values of others, then it can be argued that the approximation makes more assumptions than are necessary to solve the problem at hand. In such cases, it can be more accurate to model the conditional density functions directly using a discriminative model (see below), although application-specific details will ultimately dictate which approach is most suitable in any particular case.

=== Discriminative models ===

* k-nearest neighbors algorithm
* Logistic regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Tree Learning
* Random Forest
* Maximum-entropy Markov models
* Conditional random fields

== Examples ==
=== Simple example ===
Suppose the input data is formula_31, the set of labels for formula_32 is formula_33, and there are the following 4 data points:
formula_34

For the above data, estimating the joint probability distribution formula_28 from the empirical measure will be the following:
while formula_27 will be following:
=== Text generation ===
 gives an example in which a table of frequencies of English word pairs is used to generate a sentence beginning with &quot;representing and speedily is an good&quot;; which is not proper English but which will increasingly approximate it as the table is moved from word pairs to word triplets etc.

<doc id="1222585" wikidata="Q2920358" url="?curid=1222585" title="Central Florida">
<text>Central Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida. Different sources give different definitions for the region, but as its name implies it is usually said to comprise the central part of the state, including the Tampa Bay area and the Greater Orlando area, though in recent times the Tampa Bay area has often been described as its own region, with &quot;Central Florida&quot; becoming more synonymous with the Orlando area (most notably, this is what the local news channels in each respective metro area call their region).

It is one of Florida&#x27;s three directional regions, along with North Florida and South Florida. Under the previously mentioned &quot;usual&quot; definition, it includes the following 13 counties: Brevard, Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Lake, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Seminole, Sumter, and Volusia. Sometimes Ocala, which is in Marion County, was included. Although Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas are also considered to be the Tampa Bay area.

==Geography==
Like many vernacular regions, Central Florida&#x27;s boundaries are not official or consistent, and are defined differently by different sources. A 2007 study of Florida&#x27;s regions by geographers Ary Lamme and Raymond K. Oldakowski found that Floridians surveyed identified Central Florida as comprising a large swath of peninsular Florida. This area encompassed the interior, including the Orlando metropolitan area, and coastal stretches from the Citrus County south to the Hillsborough County in the west and from Volusia County south to Sebastian in the east. 

Central Florida is one of Florida&#x27;s three most common directional regions, the others being North Florida and South Florida. Lamme and Oldakowski note that the directional region is more commonly used in the interior areas rather than on the coast. In fact, while coastal areas often have their own regional vernacular identities such as the Space Coast and the Nature Coast, no vernacular regions were reported on the interior of the state other than Central Florida.

Enterprise Florida, the state&#x27;s economic development agency, identifies &quot;Central Florida&quot; as one of eight economic regions used by the agency and other state and outside entities, including the Florida Department of Transportation. This definition covers much of the same area as in Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s survey, with some exceptions. The central region includes the Orlando metropolitan area (Orange, Lake, Osceola, and Seminole Counties), and Sumter, Polk counties in the interior, Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties on the west coast and Volusia and Brevard Counties on the east coast.

The central cities of both metropolitan areas (Orlando and Tampa) are in close proximity (), and as a result, their two metropolitan areas blend together in the area of Lakeland to make up a larger contiguous population center often referred to as the I-4 corridor. This is a population concentration that stretches from Tampa Bay on the west coast to Daytona Beach and Cape Canaveral on the east coast of the state.

With the exception of hill terrain in Mount Dora, southern Lake County, Polk County (Lake Wales Ridge) Pasco County, and Hernando County (Brooksville Ridge). Central Florida is mostly flatland with significant amounts of open space and over 1,500 lakes and ponds. There is a mixture of wetlands, Cypress, Oak, Maple and Pine forests, pastures, prairies and coastline.

Major rivers include the St. Johns River, the Halifax River, the Ocklawaha River and the Econlockhatchee River. Major lakes include Lake Apopka, Lake Tohopekaliga, East Lake Tohopekaliga, Lake Louisa, Lake Monroe, Lake Jessup, and the Butler Chain of Lakes. There are over of coastline in Central Florida along the Atlantic Coast. Major beaches include Canaveral National Seashore, New Smyrna Beach, Daytona Beach, Cocoa Beach, and Indialantic Beach near Melbourne.

===Climate===
Hurricanes are a threat to the coastal cities as evidenced by the 2004 hurricane season, which brought three major hurricanes to the Central Florida area: Charley, Jeanne, and Frances.Winters are dry and temperate with the average winter high temperature in Orlando being and the average winter low temperature being . Summers are hot and humid with high temperatures averaging and low temperatures averaging . Peak summer heat generally arrives in early June and continues to early October.

The combination of high temperatures, high humidity, and opposing sea breezes from both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, results in significant thunderstorm activity from June to September for the interior counties. Central Florida records more lightning strikes per area than any other region in Florida, and Florida records more lightning strikes than any other state in the US. As a result, Florida, and more specifically, Central Florida, is often referred to as the &quot;Thunderstorm capital of the USA&quot;, or &quot;Lightning Alley.&quot;

These severe thunderstorms often make Central Florida prone to many tornadoes. However, they are usually small, short lived, and almost always rated as EF0 or EF1 size storms.

According to the Köppen climate classification, Central Florida has a subtropical climate. A climate that is typical for the majority of the state, except for South Florida, which has a tropical climate. Unlike South Florida, where temperatures below practically never occur, Central Florida can see occasional freezing temperatures in the some winters (though brief). Consequently, most of Central Florida cannot accommodate the same tropical plants found in Southern Florida with the exception of coastal areas in the Tampa Bay area, Brevard county, and Indian River county due to maritime influences of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. However, winters are still warmer than most other areas of the United States in winter. Central Florida’s typical high temperatures in the winter are around . The low temperatures near 50 F. 

==History==
At the end of the Civil War, aside from the cattle, cotton, and coastal lands, much of Central Florida was wetlands. It took a major drainage project financed by businessman Hamilton Disston in the 1880s to make these wetland areas available for settlement.
Sanford was incorporated in 1877 as a port city at the Lake Monroe intersection and the St. Johns River. It was envisioned as a transportation center; the city&#x27;s founder, Henry S. Sanford, nicknamed it &quot;the Gate City of South Florida&quot;. It became a hub for shipping agricultural products, which earned the city another nickname, &quot;Celery City&quot;.

Kissimmee, originally named Allendale, after Confederate Major J.H. Allen, who operated the first cargo steamboat on the Kissimmee River, boomed in the 1880s. It was the headquarters of Hamilton Disston&#x27;s drainage company. The city was an important regional steamship port, owing that status to its location on Lake Tohopekaliga. Expanding the railroads into Central Florida eliminated the need for Kissimmee&#x27;s steamship industry.

The Great Freeze of 1894-1895 ruined citrus crops, which had a detrimental ripple effect on the economy.

The hard-packed sand of Volusia County&#x27;s beaches lent itself to auto races beginning in 1903 before paved roads were common, leading to the area&#x27;s reputation for cars and racing. Ormond Beach was a popular spot for those who liked fast cars after the turn of the 20th century because the hard-packed beach was ideal for going fast. The same beach had led to the development of a tourist resort by Henry Flagler. It later attracted Flagler&#x27;s former business partner John D. Rockefeller, who had a winter home in Ormond.

During and after World War II, the U.S. Army Air Forces (U.S. Air Force after 1947) and the U.S. Navy established several training facilities and operational bases in the region, mainly for aviation activities, followed by space exploration sites. In the late 1940s, the U.S. military established a missile testing facility on Merritt Island near Cape Canaveral. The land was largely undeveloped and the agreeable climate allowed for year-round operations. When NASA later searched for a long-term base in the 1960s to launch spacecraft, it chose the Merritt Island site next to Cape Canaveral for its access to the testing facility and nearby communities. NASA purchased over of land for the Kennedy Space Center.

Deltona was developed in 1962 as a planned retirement community. It is now the largest city in Volusia County.


The construction of the Walt Disney World Resort was a transforming event for greater Orlando. Walt Disney wanted a location with abundant available land that was more accessible for the residents of the eastern United States to visit. Not only was there ample land in Central Florida, but it was inexpensive, and the inland location offered some protection from hurricanes. Plans were announced in 1965, and the theme park opened to the public in 1971.

==Culture and attributes==
Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s survey identifies several demographic, political, and cultural elements that characterize Central Florida and distinguish it from other areas of the state. While people from all parts of the state associated their area as part of the South, people in the southern part of Central Florida did not typically identify their area as part of &quot;Dixie&quot;, while people in northern Central Florida did. People from Central Florida usually did not consider their region part of the Bible Belt.
Politically, while North Florida overwhelmingly was considered conservative and South Florida was considered more liberal, the majority of Central Florida residents (52%) considered their area moderate; 41% considered it conservative, and 7% liberal. Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s survey tracks with Barney Warf and Cynthia Waddell&#x27;s studies of Florida&#x27;s political geography during the 2000 Presidential election. Central Florida&#x27;s economy is very similar to that in South Florida. Compared to the more diversified North Florida economy, tourism is by far the most significant industry in Central and South Florida, along with a much smaller but significant agricultural industry.

Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s survey also found some cultural indicators that characterize Central Florida. In general, Central Florida was similar to North Florida and differed from South Florida in these measures. In Central and North Florida, American cuisine was the most popular food, in contrast to South Florida where ethnic foods were equally popular. Additionally, while there was little geographical variation for most styles of music, there was regional variation for both country and Latin music. Country was popular in Central and North Florida, and less so in South Florida, while Latin was less popular in Central and North Florida, and more so in South Florida.

==Demographics==
In 2009, the estimated total population of the Central Florida, including the populations of Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Brevard, Volusia, and Lake Counties region was 3.3 million people. If the populations of Polk and Sumter counties were included, the estimated population would be 3.969 million people. Exponential growth has fueled Central Florida for the past thirty years.

As of 2007 there were 70,000 Asians in Central Florida according to the U.S. Census. There were almost 1,900 Japanese persons, making up 3% of the Asians.

==Cities==
Selected cities in Central Florida arranged by population:
==Economy==
Agriculture has occupied a large portion of Central Florida&#x27;s economy, with winter strawberries, citrus, timber, vegetables, and aquaculture all making major contributions.

Tourism is a large contributor to Central Florida&#x27;s economy.

The area has economically diversified in the past decade. As a high-tech industrial hub, Metro Orlando has the seventh largest research park in the U.S., Central Florida Research Park, the engineering and business school of the University of Central Florida. It has defense companies such as Lockheed Martin and Siemens.

Medical research is prominent at Tampa&#x27;s University of South Florida and Orlando&#x27;s University of Central Florida, as well as the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute biomedical research facility. USF in particular is a national leader in cancer and dementia research.

The Tampa Bay area has become a center of high-tech manufacturing and research, while both Orlando and the Tampa Bay area are centers for the financial industry, especially insurers and back-end operations for large banking companies. 

Active military installations in the region include Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station located on the Atlantic coast; MacDill Air Force Base, Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater and Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg on the Gulf Coast; and Naval Support Activity Orlando, the Navy Pinecastle Impact (Bombing) Range, and the Avon Park Air Force Range located inland. These are augmented by major commands that are tenant activities at these installations, such as the headquarters for United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) and the headquarters for United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) at MacDill AFB, the Naval Ordnance Test Unit and Coast Guard Station Port Canaveral at Cape Canaveral SFS, and other Active, Reserve, Army National Guard, and Air National Guard activities that are located as either stand-alone facilities or as tenants on the active duty installations.
Additional former facilities that have since been closed and converted to civilian use include Hillsborough Army Air Field, a World War II training range which is now part of a neighborhood, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and the University of South Florida; Naval Air Station Sanford, which closed in 1968 and is the present day Orlando-Sanford International Airport; McCoy Air Force Base, which closed in 1975 and is the present day Orlando International Airport; and Orlando Air Force Base, which was transferred to the Navy in 1968 and renamed Naval Training Center Orlando until its BRAC-directed closure in 1999 and conversion to the present day Baldwin Park neighborhood.

The other major U.S. Government installations in Central Florida is the Kennedy Space Center, a NASA facility located adjacent to Cape Canaveral SFS, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Outpatient Clinic at Baldwin Park (former Orlando AFB Hospital / former Naval Hospital Orlando) and the VA Hospital at Lake Nona.

===Seaports===
Port Canaveral, located in Cape Canaveral 45 minutes east of Orlando, is a cruise, cargo, and naval port. It is one of the busiest ports in Florida and is economically tied to Orlando. Locally perceived to be Orlando&#x27;s seaport, Port Canaveral is the closest port for tourists and Orlando residents alike to cruise on Disney Cruise Lines and Carnival Cruises. Future plans for the port include a rail and natural gas line running directly to Orlando International Airport.

Another major seaport of the region is Port Tampa Bay, which is one of the busiest in the state and is on the verge of a huge expansion which will allow it to compete on an international level.

A regional commuter rail network is being developed in Central Florida. The first of these initiatives, SunRail, is a commuter rail line that runs from DeLand south to Kissimmee. The first phase was completed in 2014 with the full system in place in 2015. Amtrak also serves Central Florida running on CSX Transportation&#x27;s A line and stops at the Orlando Amtrak station. The Auto Train stops in Sanford, Florida, north of downtown Orlando.

As of 2022, a high speed rail between Orlando and Miami is currently being developed by Brightline, who plans to extend the rail to Tampa after completion.

<text>Rolling Thunder Pictures was a film distribution company, set up under Miramax Films by Quentin Tarantino, that was headed by Jerry Martinez and Tarantino. It specialized on releasing independent, cult, or foreign films to theaters.
The company was created in 1995 but closed in 1999. The company was named after the film &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. 

==Releases==
The following films were re-released under the Rolling Thunder Pictures label:

*&quot;The Beyond&quot; (in association with Grindhouse Releasing)
*&quot;Chungking Express&quot;
*&quot;Detroit 9000&quot;
*&quot;Mighty Peking Man&quot;
*&quot;Sonatine&quot;
*&quot;Switchblade Sisters&quot;

The label also released the independent films &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; and &quot;Curdled&quot;. The 1994 Jet Li film &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; had been scheduled for a Rolling Thunder Pictures release, but eventually Dimension Films released it. Other production companies re-released on DVD later.

==Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Pictures Triple Feature==

On April 16, 2013, coinciding with the release of &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, Miramax and Lions Gate released a special DVD set of three films previously released under the Rolling Thunder Pictures label. The set includes &quot;The Mighty Peking Man&quot;, a &quot;King Kong&quot; knock-off; &quot;Detroit 9000&quot;, a detective-style blaxploitation film; and &quot;Switchblade Sisters&quot;, an obvious inspiration for Tarantino&#x27;s films. Tarantino said of the collection &quot;If you like my stuff, you can look at it as – this is where mine came from.&quot;

<text>In mathematical group theory, a tame group is a certain kind of group defined in model theory.

Formally, we define a bad field as a structure of the form (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), where &quot;K&quot; is an algebraically closed field and &quot;T&quot; is an infinite, proper, distinguished subgroup of &quot;K&quot;, such that (&quot;K&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) is of finite Morley rank in its full language. A group &quot;G&quot; is then called a tame group if no bad field is interpretable in &quot;G&quot;.

<text>The Stowe School is a public school (English private boarding school) for pupils aged 13–18 in the countryside of Stowe, England. It was opened on 11 May, 1923 at Stowe House, a Grade I Heritage Estate belonging to the British Crown. Formerly the country seat of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos, it was first constructed in 1677 and served as a consulate to monarchy and aristocracy throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. J. F. Roxburgh was the school&#x27;s first headmaster. 

The school is a member of the 18 member Rugby Group, the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, and the G30 Schools&#x27; Group. Originally for boys only, the school is now coeducational, with 541 boys and 374 girls – 915 students enrolled in the school . Roughly 80% of the school&#x27;s pupils are in boarding houses, while the other 20% are in day houses.

Pupils in the &quot;Day in Boarding&quot; program are assigned to one of the school&#x27;s boarding houses and have the option to board there for a maximum of three nights per week. Pupils in one of the school&#x27;s three Day Houses—Winton, Cheshire, and Croft—are charged a reduced fee per academic year. Students in the Day houses are not given the option to board. The school provides bursaries and other means of financial assistance to admitted students who exhibit outstanding abilities in the Arts, Academics, Sports, and other areas. A typical scholarship at Stowe is worth 5% of the school fee. 

The tuition fee includes the provision of meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), educational services, and &quot;extracurricular activities&quot;. In some instances, it also covers boarding accommodation. Additional costs, such as school uniforms, equipment, trips, and transportation (such as airport transfers and bus services), are billed at the end of each term in addition to the tuition fee. These extra costs can range from a few hundred to a few thousand pounds per term.

==History==
Stowe School opened in 1923. The main building is Stowe House, whose exterior was completed by 1779. Funding for the school came through the Rev. Percy Warrington and the Martyrs Memorial Trust. The school&#x27;s first architect was Clough Williams-Ellis.
The first Headmaster was J. F. Roxburgh. He aimed to focus on the individual child and introduce them to beauty and learning; he wanted a civilised school founded on Christian values.

The Beatles played a concert at Stowe School on 4 April 1963. A recording of the concert was revealed in 2023, and leaked to the public later in the year.

===Today===
The school&#x27;s cricket ground is used as a first class ground by Northamptonshire CCC.

The Stowe Corner of Silverstone Circuit is named after the school.

A Southern Railway &quot;Schools Class&quot; steam locomotive, No. 928, which was built in 1934 was named after the school, and is preserved at the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex.

In 2005, the school was investigated by the Office of Fair Trading for &quot;price fixing&quot;, participating in a &quot;fee-fixing cartel&quot;. 

In 2016, a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; investigator posing as a parent of a Russian pupil was told by the then school registrar that while pupils would always be expected to pass the entrance exam, it would help secure a place if a borderline child&#x27;s parents were able to donate &quot;about £100,000 or something like that.&quot;

==Boarding houses==

There are 13 boarding houses: 8 boys&#x27; houses and 5 girls&#x27; houses. There are also three Day Houses - 2 boys&#x27; houses and 1 girls&#x27; house. The boarding houses are mostly named after members of the family of Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. Each house has a number or letter assigned to it. 

==Cricket ground==

The first recorded match on the school cricket ground came in 1928 when Stowe School played St Paul&#x27;s School. Buckinghamshire played their first Minor Counties Championship match there in 1947, when the opponents were Berkshire. Between 1947 and 1982 the ground held five Minor Counties Championship matches, the last of which saw Buckinghamshire draw against Bedfordshire. The ground has also hosted a single MCCA Knockout Trophy match which saw Buckinghamshire play Bedfordshire.

The ground has also held a single List A match for Northamptonshire in the 2005 totesport League, against Gloucestershire. and has held fourteen Second XI fixtures for the Northamptonshire Second XI in the Second XI Championship and Second XI Trophy.

<text>The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) was a United Kingdom policing agency. Following the Police and Criminal Justice Act 2001, NCIS returned to direct funding by the Home Office in 2002 and was a non-departmental public body. On 1 April 2006 it was merged into the newly created Serious Organised Crime Agency.
The unit was established in April 1992, previously known as the National Drugs Intelligence Unit. Organised according to the Police Act 1997, the functions of NCIS were to gather intelligence data and analysed this information to provide the necessary insight and intelligence to national police forces. The act also empowered the service with rights to perform surveillance operations.

Organisation of the service included units specialising in organised crimes and crimes involving illicit drugs, football and financial issues. A specialised unit was focused especially on kidnap and extortion, counterfeit money, the stealing of automobiles and paedophilic crimes. At the time of the creation of the service, there was a paedophile unit integral to the organisation of the service. The service consisted of 500 officers.

The service was designed specifically to act against crime classified as both organised in performance and of a serious nature. Relevant groups were to include necessarily:
* at least three people
* engaging in ongoing criminal activity for prolonged periods, something like a &quot;career criminal&quot; 
* are motivated in acting to gain in power and for the accumulation of profit.

The service received £138 million in funding during 1999.

The unit was merged with the National Crime Squad and other agencies in 2006 to form SOCA.

The Director General had no responsibility for terrorist responses, which at the time was dealt with by the Security Service (MI5) and Constabulary Special Branches coordinated by the Metropolitan Police Special Branch (MPSB).

<doc id="1222601" wikidata="Q2345047" url="?curid=1222601" title="Johnny van Doorn">
<text>Johan &quot;Johnny&quot; van Doorn (12 November 1944 – 26 January 1991) was a Dutch writer, poet, and performer, first in Arnhem, later in the country&#x27;s capital Amsterdam. As a poet Van Doorn called himself Johnny the Selfkicker, a nickname fulfilled by means of wild, often haphazard, performances, during which he never failed to work himself into a frenzy, often resulting in him collapsing in front of an astonished audience, for example in the middle of a large retail outlet.

== Early life ==
Johan van Doorn was born on 12 November 1944, during the final stages of World War II, in the village of Beekbergen. His parents had fled there from their native city of Arnhem, where Operation Market Garden was culminating in the Battle of Arnhem. Van Doorn would later spend most of his childhood and youth in the ruins of Arnhem.

His childhood years were not easy for Van Doorn, because he was born from a marriage between a Dutch man and a German woman.

== Career ==
Later he became well known for his &quot;primordial verse&quot;, as he used to call it; poetry at its very roots, the cradle of humanity from which nothing emanates but hoarse and raw screams and sounds that hardly have any resemblance with actual words and their meaning.

Early in his career Van Doorn was not very popular. Not just his poetry, but his entire posture, as well as his frantic and openly demonstrated drug use were offensive to many people during those otherwise so orderly and phlegmatic postwar decades in the Netherlands, when student uproars, hippies and &quot;altered states of perception&quot; had not yet been heard of. Many people would later come to admire the dedication that characterises Van Doorn&#x27;s performances and writing.

Van Doorn died on 26 January 1991 in Amsterdam, at the age of 46.

==Namesake==
A Dutch bi-annual &quot;Prize for Spoken Literature&quot; and a square in the centre of Arnhem are both named after him.

<doc id="1222605" wikidata="Q5137063" url="?curid=1222605" title="Clyde steamer">
<text>The Clyde steamer is the collective term for several passenger services that existed on the River Clyde in Scotland, running from Glasgow downstream to Rothesay and other towns, a journey known as going &quot;doon the watter&quot;.
The era of the Clyde steamer began in August 1812 with the very first successful commercial steamboat service in Europe, when Henry Bell&#x27;s began a passenger service on the River Clyde between Glasgow and Greenock. The &quot;Comet&quot; undertook her official trial run on 6 August 1812. Henry Bell himself was on board, along with John Robertson, maker of &quot;Comet&quot;″s engine, and William McKenzie, formerly a schoolmaster in Helensburgh, acting as skipper. According to the &quot;Glasgow Courier&quot; newspaper two days later, the journey was completed in three-and-a-half hours. After this success, other operators sprang up in competition, and the Firth of Clyde became immensely popular with holidaymakers. By 1900 there were over three hundred Clyde steamers operating, and the industry was still in full swing by the early 1960s. Then, competition from new forms of holiday travel brought the era almost to a close, but continues to provide excursions.

From the outset, steamboat services were aimed at holidaymakers, with a stop at Helensburgh bringing passengers to Bell&#x27;s Baths Hotel. Within ten years, there were nearly fifty steamers on the Firth of Clyde, sailing as far as Largs, Campbeltown and Inveraray, and the Glasgow Magistrates had introduced a five-pound fine for services running late to prevent &quot;the Masters of Steam Boats, from improper competition and rivalship, postponing their departure for considerable and uncertain periods, after the times they had previously intimated to the Public&quot;. Steamer services were also introduced onto the inland lochs, with the &quot;Marion&quot; appearing on Loch Lomond in 1816.

With the Industrial Revolution and rapid industrialisation and population growth of 19th-century Glasgow, great numbers were eager to be released from the grimy city on &quot;Fast Days&quot;, and during the annual Glasgow Fair week they went on a cruise down the Clyde to clean, unspoilt scenery. Tiny villages, perhaps with a stone jetty, soon became resorts with wooden piers and villas, hotels and public houses. Local residents would let out rooms, and boarding houses developed. Established towns like Dunoon and Rothesay, on the Isle of Bute, became major resorts. The wealthy built sandstone villas at places like Kilcreggan, Blairmore and Innellan, to which they could commute daily, or weekly, during the summer.

The first turbine-powered merchant vessel, the Clyde steamer , was built in 1901. Her successor, the of 1933, was a floating restaurant on the River Thames in London until 2009. She was rescued by the Friends of TS Queen Mary, and she is now undergoing restoration on the Clyde in preparation for a return to passenger service in summer 2024.

The PS &quot;Waverley&quot;, built in 1947, is the last sea-going paddle steamer in the world. This ship sails a full season of cruises every year from places around Britain, and has sailed across the English Channel for a visit to commemorate the 1940 sinking of her 1899-built predecessor at the Battle of Dunkirk. The 1900 steamer still sails on Loch Katrine, while on Loch Lomond the is being restored.

<text>William Endfield Steinberg (born February 26, 1950) is an American songwriter. He achieved his greatest success in the 1980s with songwriting partner Tom Kelly; together they wrote or co-wrote the No. 1 hits &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; by Madonna (1984), &quot;True Colors&quot; by Cyndi Lauper (1986), &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; by the Bangles (1989), &quot;So Emotional&quot; by Whitney Houston (1987), and &quot;Alone&quot; (covered by Heart in 1987). They also wrote or co-wrote the hit songs &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; (recorded by various artists, initially recorded by Roy Orbison in 1987 but first released by Cyndi Lauper in 1989), &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; by Divinyls (1990), and &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; by The Pretenders (1994).

After Kelly retired from music in the 1990s, Steinberg collaborated with other songwriters. With Rick Nowels and Marie-Claire D&#x27;Ubaldo he wrote the hit songs &quot;Falling Into You&quot; (covered by Celine Dion) and &quot;One &amp; One&quot;. He has written hit songs with Josh Alexander including &quot;All About Us&quot; by t.A.T.u. (2005), &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; by JoJo (2006), &quot;Over It&quot; by Katharine McPhee (2007), and &quot;Give Your Heart a Break&quot; by Demi Lovato (2012).

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Steinberg grew up in Fresno, California and moved to Palm Springs, California when he was 12 where he worked in his father&#x27;s table grape operation. His father, Lionel Steinberg, ran the David Freedman Company, the largest grape grower in the Coachella Valley. He attended Cate School in California, and Bard College in New York. Steinberg is Jewish.

===Music career===
In his mid-20s, he formed the group Billy Thermal, which eventually was signed to Richard Perry&#x27;s Planet Records.

Their breakthrough occurred in 1980 when Linda Ronstadt heard their album and decided to record their song &quot;How Do I Make You?&quot; for her 1980 &quot;Mad Love&quot; album. The album hit the top three of the charts and went platinum, and Ronstadt&#x27;s version of their song reached the American top 10.

Pat Benatar, on her 1980 album &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, covered another Billy Thermal song, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Follow You&quot;. In 1981, Steinberg wrote &quot;Precious Time&quot;, which became the title track for Benatar&#x27;s album &quot;Precious Time&quot;. Also that year, Steinberg began writing with Tom Kelly, who had written another song (&quot;Fire and Ice&quot;) on the album for Benatar.

Further success followed with the song &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, when it was played for Warner Bros. executives who thought it would be perfect for Madonna. Steinberg later recalled writing the lyric in 1983 following a failed relationship, stating that he had genuinely felt that he&#x27;d &quot;made it through the wilderness&quot; and that he was &quot;beat, incomplete&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s version of the song spent six weeks at number one in the United States in 1984 and became a worldwide hit. It was also the title track for her number one album.

The success of the partnership continued with more number one singles, &quot;True Colors&quot; (recorded by Cyndi Lauper), &quot;So Emotional&quot; (by Whitney Houston), &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (by the Bangles) and &quot;Alone&quot; (by Heart).

Their other hits include &quot;In Your Room&quot; (the Bangles), &#x27;Spirit of Love&#x27; (by Laura Branigan), &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; (recorded by Roy Orbison, Cyndi Lauper and Celine Dion), &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; (Divinyls), &quot;Sex as a Weapon&quot; (by Pat Benatar), and &quot;Look Me in the Heart&quot; (by Tina Turner). They also wrote several songs with Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, including the top-10 single &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand By You&quot;. Artists such as REO Speedwagon, Cheap Trick, Bette Midler, Belinda Carlisle, and Taylor Dayne (on her multi-platinum debut album &quot;Tell It to My Heart&quot;) also recorded their songs.

In the mid-1990s, Steinberg began writing with Rick Nowels, who had established himself as a songwriter for artists such as Stevie Nicks and Belinda Carlisle. Their greatest success of the period was the Celine Dion recording of &quot;Falling into You&quot;. In 1997, Steinberg co-wrote the track &quot;One &amp; One&quot; with Rick Nowels and Marie-Claire D&#x27;Ubaldo for Edyta Górniak, and this song became a hit in Europe and Asia; Edyta became the first Polish singer on the Music &amp; Media&#x27;s European Radio Top 50 airplay chart. Between 1997 and 1999, he has written songs for Melanie C on her debut album &quot;Northern Star&quot; as well as the Corrs&#x27; second album &quot;Talk On Corners&quot;.

In 2005, Steinberg collaborated with producer Josh Alexander and Jessica and Lisa Origliasso of the Veronicas to write several tracks for the Veronicas&#x27; debut release, &quot;The Secret Life Of...&quot;, including the third single, &quot;When It All Falls Apart&quot;. Steinberg and Alexander also wrote &quot;All About Us&quot;, a hit for the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. They wrote JoJo&#x27;s 2006 single &quot;Too Little Too Late&quot; and Leigh Nash&#x27;s &quot;Nervous in the Light of Dawn&quot; and &quot;My Idea of Heaven&quot;, and Katharine McPhee&#x27;s &quot;Over It&quot; in 2007. In 2008, Steinberg and Alexander wrote &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; for t.A.T.u.&#x27;s album &quot;Happy Smiles&quot;. He wrote songs with Alexander on JoJo&#x27;s scrapped album &quot;All I Want Is Everything&quot;.

With Alexander and Porcelain Black, he wrote the track &quot;How Do You Love Someone?&quot; for Ashley Tisdale&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Guilty Pleasure&quot;. In 2010, Steinberg and Alexander wrote &quot;What Happened to Us&quot; for Australian singer Jessica Mauboy for her album &quot;Get &#x27;Em Girls&quot;. With Alexander and Toby Gad, he wrote the 2011 song &quot;Don&#x27;t Hold Your Breath&quot; for Nicole Scherzinger, and with Alexander and Rivers Cuomo he wrote the 2011 song &quot;High Maintenance&quot; for Miranda Cosgrove. Steinberg and Alexander also wrote and produced the hit song &quot;Give Your Heart a Break&quot; by Demi Lovato. He wrote the 2016 song &quot;My Stupid Heart&quot; for Tini Stoessel. 

==Appearance in film==
Steinberg performs an acoustic version of &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; in an on camera interview in the documentary film &quot;&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Steinberg was awarded a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in 2008.

<text>Thomas F. Kelly (born April 16, 1952) is an American musician. With Billy Steinberg he co-wrote numerous hit songs for popular music artists, including five number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the 1980s.

==Early life==
Originally from Indiana, Kelly lived in Effingham, Illinois from 1963 to 1966, before moving back to West Lafayette, Indiana where he graduated from West Lafayette High School in 1967. Kelly attended Eastern Illinois University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Purdue University, but dropped out of college to pursue his music career. He played bass guitar and sang in several bands throughout Illinois and Indiana in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including the Trifaris, the Gaping Huggers, the One Eyed Jacks, and the Guild.

In 1974 Kelly moved to Los Angeles with his first wife, Kay Kelly, and two children, Barry and Denise. He played in Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s backup band, and joined with other members of the band under the name &#x27;Fools Gold&#x27; to release two albums in 1976 and 1977. Kelly became a prominent session singer in Los Angeles, singing backing vocals for many recording artists. He accompanied Toto on their 1979 World Tour as a backing vocalist and rhythm guitarist, and sang background vocals on the Toto albums &quot;Toto IV&quot;, Isolation, and &quot;The Seventh One&quot;.

==Songwriting==
In 1981 Kelly wrote his first hit song, &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, with Pat Benatar for her album &quot;Precious Time&quot;.

After Kelly met Billy Steinberg at a party in 1981, the duo began writing songs together, with Steinberg as lyricist and Kelly the principal music writer. Steinberg and Kelly wrote songs for a variety of popular music artists, including five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The pair also joined together as i-Ten to release the album &quot;Taking a Cold Look&quot; in 1983.

<text>Choi Kwang-jo (born March 2, 1942) is a former South Korean national champion in taekwondo, and is one of the twelve original masters of taekwondo of the Korea Taekwon-Do Association. Following a career in the South Korean military, he emigrated to the United States of America in 1970. Choi is the founder and head of the Choi Kwang Do international martial art organization, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

==Early life==

Choi was born on March 2, 1942, in Daegu, Keishōhoku-dō, Korea, Empire of Japan. He started training in the martial arts at the age of 12 because his father was concerned—he wanted his small, physically weak son to be able to protect himself in the war-torn streets. Choi&#x27;s first master was Dong Ju Lee. During his military service, Choi became a chief Instructor in the 20th Infantry Division and came into contact with General H. H. Choi when the military began to use taekwondo for unarmed combat.

==United States==
Due to injuries sustained from his martial arts training he sought medical attention in the United States of America, moving in 1970, and began to study different physical therapy techniques. As a result, he began to study anatomy, physiology, and human-movement sciences.

In 1987, Choi incorporated everything he had learned into his own martial art system called Choi Kwang Do, which translates as “the art (or method) of Kwang Choi.” Choi maintains that Choi Kwang Do is free from the mysticisms of traditional martial arts, yet he advertises that his art practises yoga-based stretching. Choi heads the Choi Kwang Do organization from Atlanta and was inducted into the &quot;Tae Kwon Do Times&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2006. One notable critic of Choi is Roger Koo. Since resigning from the post of Vice President under Choi&#x27;s organization in 1991, Koo has remained a staunch opponent. Koo dedicates a large portion of his website to disparaging Choi and his organization.

Choi is listed as a pioneer in Asia (1950s and 1960s) and Canada (1970s) in Chang Keun Choi&#x27;s list of taekwondo pioneers.

<text>Dallas Semiconductor, founded in 1984, acquired by Maxim Integrated in 2002, then acquired by Analog Devices in 2021, was a company that designed and manufactured analog, digital, and mixed-signal semiconductors (integrated circuits, or ICs). Its specialties included communications products (including T/E and Ethernet products), microcontrollers, battery management, thermal sensing and thermal management, non-volatile random-access memory, microprocessor supervisors, delay lines, silicon oscillators, digital potentiometers, real-time clocks, temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXOs), iButton, and 1-Wire products.

== History ==
The company, based in Dallas, Texas, was founded in 1984 and purchased by Maxim Integrated Products for $2.5 billion in 2001. Both the Maxim and Dallas Semiconductor brands were actively used until 2007. Since then, the Maxim name has been used for all new products, though the Dallas Semiconductor brand has been retained for some older products, which can be identified by &quot;DS&quot; at the beginning of their part numbers, for example the 1-Wire communications protocol devices. 

Notable products by the company included the DS80-series microcontrollers with 8051 instruction set.

As of June 2021, devices are still under active production by Maxim Integrated. In August 2021, Maxim was then acquired by Analog Devices.

<doc id="1222627" wikidata="Q712569" url="?curid=1222627" title="Geom Mojam">
<text>Geom Mojam (?–670) was the military leader of a short-lived movement to restore Goguryeo after its fall to Silla in the later 7th century CE. After the kingdom fell to Tang and Silla in 668, he kindled an opposition movement in the Taedong River valley and in 670 established Anseung (안승, 安勝, another source has it as Ansun, 안순, 安舜) as the new King of Goguryeo. Anseung is believed to have been the illegitimate son of King Bojang, the last ruler of that kingdom. The capital was set up in modern-day Chaeryŏng-gun, South Hwanghae, North Korea. The rebellion is briefly described in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, Goguryeo Book 10.

One source gives Geom&#x27;s birthplace as Surimseong (수림성, 水臨城), while the Samguk Sagi (“Annals of Silla”/King Munmu 10/Month 6) relates that he was a native of the walled city of Yeongnim (location unknown). His date of birth is unknown. As military official, the Samguk Sagi relates, he reached the rank of &quot;daehyeong&quot; (대형, 大兄), seventh among the 14 ranks of Goguryeo officialdom. However, the New History of Tang (book 220/“Gaoli Monograph”) records his name as Gyeom Mojam (겸모잠, 鉗牟岑) and his office as that of daejang.

The Samguk Sagi relates how following the fall of Goguryeo Geom departed from Gungmo fortress (궁모성, 窮牟城) and arriving to the south of the Pae River he met and killed several Tang officials and the monk Fa An (法安) before heading for Silla territory. En route to Silla he met Anseung at Saya Island (present day Soya Island) and together they came to Han fortress (present day Chaeryŏng, Chaeryŏng county, South Hwanghae Province). There Anseung was proclaimed king of Goguryeo.

After placing Anseung on the throne, Geom dispatched the &quot;sohyeong&quot; (소형, 小兄) &quot;Dasik&quot; (다식, 多式) to Silla to request armed assistance and recognition from that kingdom. Silla at this time was struggling to avoid absorption into the Tang dynasty through the Protectorate General to Pacify the East (安東都護府), a military government Tang had established on the peninsula after the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo. Therefore, Silla eagerly sent an embassy recognizing Ansun as the legitimate King of Goguryeo and offering an alliance. But relation with Geom and Anseung suddenly deteriorated, and Geom was assassinated at the behest of Anseung. After the assassination, Anseung fled to Silla and later ruled the short-lived Bodeok Kingdom based in Iksan.

Geom&#x27;s struggle is comparable to that of the Baekje leader Boksin, who led a similarly ill-fated attempt to restore the Baekje state a decade before. The ultimate failure of Geom&#x27;s struggle also prepared the way for the subsequent Goguryeo diaspora.

<text>The British Electricity Authority (BEA) was established as the central British electricity authority in 1948 under the nationalisation of Great Britain&#x27;s electricity supply industry enacted by the Electricity Act 1947. The BEA was responsible for the generation, transmission and sale of electricity to area electricity boards, and the development and maintenance of an efficient, coordinated and economical system of electricity supply. 

== History ==
The authority took over the operations of over 600 small public supply power companies, municipal authority electricity departments and the Central Electricity Board to form the BEA, which comprised a central authority and 14 area boards. Its scope did not include control of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, which had been founded in 1943 and remained independent of the BEA. 

The appointment of chairmen and members of the BEA and the area boards were made in August 1947 and the BEA was formally established on 15 August 1947. The 14 area boards were formally established on 1 January 1948, and Vesting Day, when the BEA and area boards became responsible for electricity supply, was on 1 April 1948.

The London headquarters were initially at British Electricity House, Great Portland Street, W1, then British Electricity House, Trafalgar Buildings, Strand, SW1, and British Electricity House, Winsley Street, W1.

== Board structure ==
The British Electricity Authority was established by Section 2 of the &quot;Electricity Act 1947&quot;. It comprised a chairman and four to six other members appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power; four members, also appointed by the minister, who were chairmen of an area electricity board (in rotation); and one other member who was chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. 

=== Management board members ===
The first appointments to the board were:

*Lord Citrine, former member of the National Coal Board, Chairman
* Sir Henry Self, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Deputy Chairman (Administration)
* Sir John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, Deputy Chairman (Operations)
* Ernest Bussey, general secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Member for Labour Relations and Welfare
* Dame Caroline Haslett, director of the Electrical Association for Women, member
* Sir William Walker, former Lord Mayor of Manchester, member
* Tom Johnston, North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, member
* Josiah Eccles, Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board, member
* W. Lewis, Midland Electricity Board, Member
* J. S. Pickles, South West Scotland Electricity Board, member
* Henry John Randall, London Electricity Board, member

Subsequent appointments were, by rotation, the chairman of the South Eastern (Norman R. Elliott), East Midlands (C. R. King), South Wales (L. Howes) and South East Scotland Electricity Board (Sir Norman Duke) were appointed members of the BEA from 1 January 1950. Their terms expired on 31 December 1951 and were succeeded by the appointment of C. T. Melling (Eastern Electricity Board), H. H. Mullens (North Eastern), H. Nimmo (Southern), and S. F. Steward (South Western).

Sir John Hacking retired in 1953 and his place on the board was taken by Josiah Eccles as deputy chairman with effect from January 1954.

Appointments by rotation with effect from 1 January 1954 were H. J. Randall (London), W. S. Lewis (Midlands), D. Bellamy (Yorkshire), and Sir John Hallsworth (North Western).

=== Headquarters organisation ===
The headquarters organisation had seven main departments.

The Chief Contracts Officer (F. W. Smith) was responsible to both of the deputy chairmen.

A board member (E. W. Bussey) was responsible for Labour Relations and Welfare. 

Under the Deputy Chairman for Administration (Sir Henry Self) were:

* The Secretary (H. F. Carpenter)
* Commercial Manager (E. R. Wilkinson)
* Chief Accountant (D. W. Coates)
* Chief legal adviser (R. A. Finn)

Under the Deputy Chairman for Operations (Sir John Hacking) was:

* Chief Engineer (V. A. Pask), who had four deputy chief engineers
** Deputy Chief Engineer Generation had two engineering teams:
*** Generation Design Engineer
*** Generation Operations Engineer
** Deputy Chief Engineer Transmission had three engineering teams:
*** Transmission Design Engineer
*** Transmission Construction Engineer
*** System Operation Engineer, responsible for national control
** Deputy Chief Engineer Generating Station Construction had four engineering teams:
*** Coordination Engineer
*** Production Inspection and Test Engineer
*** Specifications and Contracts
*** HQ Stations Supervising Engineer
** Deputy Chief Engineer Research had two engineering teams:
*** Director of Laboratories
*** Engineer-in-Charge Electro-Technical Research

==Area boards==
Area electricity boards were established by Section 3 of the Electricity Act 1947. They were responsible for the distribution of electricity and sales to customers. They comprised a chairman and five to seven other members appointed by the Minister of Fuel and Power after consultation with the central authority; and one member holding the office of chairman of the consultative council. The new area boards were:

# East Midlands Electricity Board (EMEB)
# Eastern Electricity Board (EEB)
# London Electricity Board (LEB)
# Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board (MANWEB)
# Midlands Electricity Board (MEB)
# North Eastern Electricity Board (NEEB)
# North Western Electricity Board (NORWEB)
# South East Scotland Electricity Board 
# South Eastern Electricity Board (SEEBOARD)
# South Wales Electricity Board (SWALEC)
# South West Scotland Electricity Board 
# South Western Electricity Board (SWEB)
# Southern Electricity Board (SEB)
# Yorkshire Electricity Board (YEB)

== Consultative councils ==
Section 7 of the Electricity Act 1947 established a consultative council for each of the area electricity boards. These councils had the duty of considering matters affecting the distribution of electricity in the area, including tariffs and the provision of new or improved services, following representations by consumers or other persons requiring supplies; they could also consider any matter referred to them by the area board. They were to notify their conclusions to the board.

The councils consisted of between twenty and thirty persons appointed by the minister. Not less than half nor more than three-fifths were appointed from a panel of members of local authorities. The remainder represented agriculture, commerce, industry, labour and the general interests of consumers of electricity in the area. The chairman of each consultative council was a member of the area electricity board.

== Operations ==

=== Electricity generation, supply and sales ===
The electricity generated, supplied and sold, in GWh, over the establishment of the BEA was as follows:

==Successors==
As a result of the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act 1954, the British Electricity Authority was replaced on 1 April 1955 by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for England and Wales. At the same time, the two South of Scotland Area Boards and the associated electricity generation and distribution plant were merged into the South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB) to form an integrated electricity board responsible for generation, distribution and electricity supply in southern and central Scotland.

Soon afterwards, the Electricity Act 1957 dissolved the Central Electricity Authority, which it replaced with the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and the Electricity Council.

<doc id="1222633" wikidata="Q2427907" url="?curid=1222633" title="Royal Thai Navy">
<text>The Royal Thai Navy (Abrv: RTN, ทร.; , ) is the naval warfare force of Thailand. Established in 1906, it was modernised by the Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartiwongse (1880–1923) who is known as the father of the Royal Navy. It has a structure that includes the naval fleet, Royal Thai Marine Corps, and Air and Coastal Defence Command. The RTN headquarters is at Sattahip Naval Base.

The navy operates three naval area commands (NAC): Northern Gulf of Thailand (First NAC); Southern Gulf of Thailand (Second NAC); and the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) (Third NAC). RTN also has two air wings and one flying unit on its aircraft carrier.

==History==

=== Ancient era ===
The military history of Thailand encompasses 1,000 years of armed struggle, from wars of independence from the Khmer Empire through to struggles with her regional rivals, Burma and Vietnam, and periods of conflict with Britain and France during the colonial era.

The naval arm of the army consisted mainly of riverine war craft whose mission was to control the Chao Phraya River and protect ships carrying the army to battle. The warships carried up to 30 musketeers, a large number of rowers and a front 6 or 12-pounder cannons or no guns at all.

The Siamese navy was also supported by Chinese immigrants, mostly in Chantaburi. During the era of Taksin the Great, his army successfully sieged the old capital of Ayutthaya with the help of the Chinese shipwrights who are masters of building war junks, which carried more guns than riverine warcrafts.

=== Vietnamese-Siamese war ===

The timeline of emergence of a Siamese sea fleet is unknown. Most of its sailors were foreign, such as Cham, Malay, and Chinese. It is assumed that in this era, Ships designs changed from shallow draft Chinese junk (Reu-Sam-Pau/Reụ̄x s̄ảp̣heā) to deeper draft Kam-pan and sloop; with a short period of copied Vietnamese junks. The most prominent naval battle was at Vàm Nao River.

=== Franco-Siamese crisis ===

The Paknam Incident was a navy engagement fought during the Franco-Siamese crisis in July 1893. Three French ships violated Siamese territory and warning shots were fired at them by a Siamese fort and a force of gunboats on the Chao Phraya River in Paknam. In the ensuing battle, France prevailed and blockaded Bangkok. Peace was restored on 3 October 1893 after the British put pressure on both the Siamese and French to reach a negotiated settlement.

=== World War I ===

The First World War had no direct impact on Siam due to its distance from the fighting. The war did, however, provide an opportunity for King Rama VI to strengthen his country&#x27;s position in the international arena. He also used the war as a means to promote the concept of a Siamese nation.

Siamese sailors were part of a volunteer expeditionary force, consisting of medical, motor transport, and aviation detachments. By early-1918, 1,284 men were selected from thousands of volunteers. The force was commanded by Major General Phraya Bhijai Janriddhi and was sent to France.

===After World War I===
====Franco-Thai War====
The Battle of Ko Chang took place on 17 January 1941 during the Franco-Thai War in which a flotilla of French warships attacked a smaller force of Thai vessels, including a coastal defence ship. The HTMS &quot;Thonburi&quot; was heavily damaged and grounded on a sand bar at the mouth of the Chanthaburi River, with about 20 dead. The Thai transport HTMS &quot;Chang&quot; arrived at Ko Chang shortly after the French departed and took the &quot;Thonburi&quot; in tow, before purposefully running her aground in Laem Ngop.

The French suffered 11 men killed. During the post-action investigations, the Thai Navy claimed, based on statements by Thai sailors and the fisherman around Ko Chang and merchantmen in Saigon, that heavy damage was seen to have been caused to the French ship &quot;Lamotte-Picquet&quot; and her squadron. The battle was a tactical victory by the French Navy over the Thai Navy although the strategic result is disputed. The Japanese intervened diplomatically and mediated a ceasefire. Within a month of the engagement, the French and the Thais had negotiated a peace that ended the war.

====World War II====
During World War II, Siam allied with Japan after Japan invaded Siam on 8 December 1941. Thailand officially joined the war in January 1942.

Thai submarines saw service throughout World War II, but saw no combat. Two of them did serve an unconventional role during the war. On 14 April 1945, five months before the Japanese surrender, Bangkok&#x27;s Samsen and Wat Liab Power Plants were bombed by the Allies, leaving the city without electricity. In response to a request from the Bangkok Electricity Authority, the &quot;Matchanu&quot; and &quot;Wirun&quot; anchored at the Bangkok Dock Company and served as power generators for one of Bangkok&#x27;s tram lines.

====Manhattan Rebellion====
During the Manhattan Rebellion of 1951, the navy was involved in a failed coup against Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram which led to the sinking of flagship HTMS &quot;Sri Ayudhya&quot;.

====Vietnam War====
In support of South Vietnam and its allies during the Vietnam War, two Thai naval vessels supported ground forces with naval bombardments.

===Later years===

The navy&#x27;s combat forces include the Royal Fleet and the Royal Thai Marine Corps. The 130 vessels of the Royal Fleet include frigates equipped with surface-to-air missiles, fast attack craft armed with surface-to-surface missiles, large coastal patrol craft, coastal minelayers, coastal minesweepers, landing craft, and training ships.

The mission space of the Thailand navy includes rivers and the Gulf of Thailand and the Indian Ocean, which are separated by the Kra Isthmus. Naval affairs are directed by the country&#x27;s most senior admiral from his Bangkok headquarters. The naval commander in chief is supported by staff groups that plan and administer such activities as logistics, education and training, and various special services. The headquarters general staff function like the corresponding staffs in the Royal Thai Army army and Royal Thai Air Force command structures.

==Command and control==
The Royal Thai Navy is commanded by the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy, currently, Admiral Jirapol Wongwit, who was appointed in 2024. The Royal Thai Navy headquarters is in Bangkok.
*Commander-in-Chief, Royal Thai Navy: Admiral Jirapol Wongwit

==Organization==
===Royal Thai Naval Dockyard===
The Naval Dockyard was on Arun amarin Road, Siriraj Subdistrict, Bangkoknoi District, Bangkok. It has constructed and repaired ships since the reign of King Mongkut. As ships grew larger, King Chulalongkorn ordered the construction of a large wooden dock. He presided over the opening ceremony on 9 January 1890, a date now considered the birth of the Naval Department. Its headquarters is now at Mahidol Adulyadej Naval Dockyard, Sattahip District, Chonburi Province.

===Royal Thai Marine Corps===
The Royal Thai Marine Corps (RTMC) was founded in 1932, when the first battalion was formed with the assistance of the United States Marine Corps. It was expanded to a regiment in 1940 and was in action against communist guerrillas throughout the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s, the United States Marine Corps assisted in its expansion into a brigade. In December 1978, RECON teams of The Royal Thai Marine Corps were sent to the Mekong River during skirmishes with the Pathet Lao, a communist political movement and organisation in Laos.

Thai Marines today are responsible for border security in Chanthaburi and Trat provinces. They have fought communist insurgents in engagements at Baan Hard Lek, Baan Koat Sai, Baan Nhong Kok, Baan Kradook Chang, Baan Chumrark, and in the battle of Hard Don Nai in Nakhon Phanom Province. They serve in 2019 in the southern border provinces currently affected by the South Thailand insurgency. A monument to their valor stands at the Royal Thai Navy base at Sattahip.

==== Marine special force ====
The RTMC Reconnaissance Battalion, known as &quot;RECON&quot;, is a reconnaissance battalion. It falls under the command of the Royal Thai Marine Division. The mission of Reconnaissance Battalion is to provide task forces to conduct amphibious reconnaissance, ground reconnaissance, battlespace shaping operations, raids, and specialized insertion and extraction.

===Naval Special Warfare Command===

The Naval Special Warfare Command was set up as an underwater demolition assault unit in 1956 with the assistance of the US. A small element of the Navy SEALs has been trained to conduct maritime counter-terrorism missions. The unit has close ties with the United States Navy SEALs and conducts regular joint training exercises.

Most of the operations of the Navy SEALs are highly sensitive and are rarely divulged to the public. Navy SEALs have been used to gather intelligence along the Thai border during times of heightened tension. Navy SEALs have participated in anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Thailand.

Thai Navy SEALs participated in the Tham Luang cave rescue. The rescue team successfully extricated members of 12 junior football players and their coach, who were trapped in Tham Luang Nang Non Cave in Chiang Rai Province in July 2018. One former Navy SEAL died in the rescue effort.

===Air and Coastal Defence Command===

The Air and Coastal Defence Command was formed in 1992 under the control of the Royal Fleet Headquarters, with one coastal defence regiment and one air defence regiment. Personnel were initially drawn from the Royal Thai Marine Corps, but are now being recruited directly. The First Coastal Defence Regiment is based near the Marine Corps facility at Sattahip. The First Air Defence Regiment was near the Naval Air Wing at U-Tapao. Coastal Defence Command was greatly expanded in 1992, following the government&#x27;s decision in 1988 to charge the RTN with the responsibility of defending the eastern seaboard and Southern Seaboard Development Project. The Second Air Defence Regiment, based at Songkhla, was formed the following year. Some analysts believe that this element will eventually grow to a strength of up to 15,000 personnel.

* The First Air Defence Regiment: its mission is to provide anti-aircraft defence for the northern Gulf of Thailand with three anti-aircraft battalions.
* The Second Air Defence Regiment: to provide anti-aircraft defence for the southern Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea with three anti-aircraft battalions.
* The First Coastal Defence Regiment: has three artillery battalions.
* Two Air and Coastal Defence Command and Control Centers
* Air and Coastal Defence Supporting Regiment: one transportation battalion, one communications battalion, one maintenance battalion.

=== Royal Thai Naval Air Division ===

The RTN recently has two air wings and one Flying Unit of aircraft carrier HTMS Chakri Naruebet, operating 23 fixed-wing aircraft and 26 helicopters from U-Tapao, Songkhla, and Phuket. The First Royal Thai Navy wing has three squadrons; the Second Royal Thai Navy wing has three squadrons and another wing for HTMS Chakri Naruebet Flying Unit.

===Royal Thai Naval Academy===

The Royal Thai Naval Academy in Samut Prakan was established by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in 1898, Those who want to enter the academy first have to pass the entrance exam, after which they join a three-year preparatory program at the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School where they study together with army, air force, and police cadets. On successful completion, they enter the academy. After graduation, they attend a further one-year advanced course at Sattahip that leads to a graduate diploma in naval science. On completion of this course, they are ready to work as officers in the Royal Thai Navy or Royal Thai Marine Corps. Cadets graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering or science and are commissioned in the Royal Thai Navy with the rank of ensign (sub-lieutenant). Together with graduates of the other armed forces and police academies they receive their swords from the king personally or the king&#x27;s representative. Selected first-year cadets of the RTNA are awarded scholarships to study at naval academies abroad. On their return to Thailand they start working as officers in the Royal Thai Navy straightaway.

=== Naval Medical Department ===
The Naval Medical Department was first set up on 1 April 1890 and is headquartered at Somdech Phra Pinklao Hospital in Bangkok. It provides medical services for sailors of the Royal Thai Navy and operates a number of hospitals in Thailand including Queen Sirikit Naval Hospital in Chonburi, opened on 20 November 1995.

=== Royal Thai Navy Music Division ===
A Royal Thai Navy band has existed since the RTN was only a naval department of the Royal Thai Army. Its began with the creation of the &quot;Naval Trumpet Band&quot; on 10 June 1878, with the arrival of the new royal yacht &quot;Vesatri&quot; and her captain, M. Fusco, who later was one of the training instructors.

Captain Fusco had the duty to stage musicals for King Rama V when the king traveled by sea, as when King Chulalongkorn visited Europe in 1897. The government assigned the young ensemble under the command of Captain Fusco to the Royal Yacht &quot;Maha Chakri&quot;&#x27; for the voyage to Europe. This band would later become the basis of the Royal Thai Navy Music Division of the RTN Bangkok Naval Base. Today, the RTNMD stations bands in all naval bases and installations, as well as in educational institutions.
=== Naval Military Police Regiment ===

The navy was the first branch of the Thai military to create a military police unit. The naval military police was established at the order of Marshal Admiral Paribatra Sukhumbandhu, Prince of Nakhon Sawan, who was a naval commander at that time. 
The official founding date was on 14 December 1905 by the Department of Mechanical Ships and the Department of Naval Affairs.

== Equipment ==

The Royal Thai Navy fleet consists of ships constructed in Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Thai shipbuilding companies and RTN dockyards such as Mahidol Adulyadej Naval Dockyard, Asian Marine Services, Marsun Shipbuilding, Italthai Marine, and Bangkok Dock also have the capability to construct vessels.

Thailand worked with more than 60 nations in providing help to the Nepali people following an earthquake. Operation Sahayogi Haat (&#x27;helping hands&#x27;) was a US military relief operation delivering humanitarian assistance to victims of the April and May 2015 Nepal earthquakes. The Royal Thai Navy assisted relief efforts. A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the region of Kathmandu in Nepal on 25 April 2015. Operation Sahayogi Haat for humanitarian relief operations was put into action by Joint Task Force 505 on 6 May 2015.

<text>The Incal (; French: &quot;L&#x27;Incal&quot;) is a French graphic novel series written by Alejandro Jodorowsky and originally illustrated by Jean Giraud (aka Mœbius). &quot;The Incal&quot;, with first pages originally released as Une aventure de John Difool (&quot;A John Difool Adventure&quot;) in &quot;Métal hurlant&quot; and published by Les Humanoïdes Associés, introduced Jodorowsky&#x27;s &quot;Jodoverse&quot; (or &quot;Metabarons Universe&quot;), a fictional universe in which his science fiction comics take place. It is an epic space opera blending fantastical intergalactic voyage, science, technology, political intrigues, conspiracies, messianism, mysticism, poetry, , love stories, and satire. &quot;The Incal&quot; includes and expands the concepts and artwork from the abandoned film project &quot;Dune&quot; directed by Jodorowsky and designed by Giraud from the early 1970s.

Originally published in installments between 1980 and 1988 in the French magazine &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, and followed by &quot;Before the Incal&quot; (1988–1995, with Zoran Janjetov), &quot;After the Incal&quot; (2000, with Jean Giraud), and &quot;Final Incal&quot; (2008–2014, with José Ladrönn), it has been described as a contender for &quot;the best comic book&quot; in the medium&#x27;s history. From it came spin-off series &quot;Metabarons&quot;, &quot;The Technopriests&quot;, and &quot;Megalex&quot;.

==Content==
===&quot;The Incal&quot;===
The story is set in the dystopian capital city of an insignificant planet in a human-dominated galactic empire, wherein the Bergs, aliens who resemble featherless birds and reside in a neighboring galaxy, make up another power bloc. It starts in medias res with Difool thrown from the Suicide Alley to the great acid lake below by a masked group, luckily saved by a police cruiser. During the questioning he denies that he received the Light Incal, a crystal of enormous and infinite powers (it guides and protects those who believe in it), from a dying Berg. The Incal is then sought by many factions: the Bergs; the corrupt government of the great pit-city; the rebel group Amok (led by Tanatah); and the Church of Industrial Saints, commonly referred to as the Techno-Technos or the Technopriests, a sinister technocratic cult which worships the Dark Incal. Animah (an allusion to anima), the keeper of the Light Incal, seeks it as well. During the journey Difool and Deepo (Difool&#x27;s loyal concrete seagull) are joined by Animah, The Metabaron, Solune, Tanatah (sister of Animah) and Kill Wolfhead, with a task of saving the universe from the forces of the Dark Incal, and the Technopriests manufacture and launch into outer space the sun-eating Dark Egg. As the darkness is overcome, Difool is brought before Orh, the fatherlike divinity, who tells him he must remember what he witnessed. As Difool falls away, he finds himself where he was at the beginning, falling down the shaft.

===&quot;Before the Incal&quot;===
The story is a considerably more straightforward noir tale of boundless urban corruption with the relative absence of spiritualistic elements, which dips deeper into exploring the urban fabric of the world of &quot;The Incal&quot;. The story follows young Difool living in demimonde. He soon finds that his prostitute mother devoted herself to growing amorine, a drug that restores the ability to love. His father, Olivier Difool, breaks the law in wearing a fake halo that is the mark of an aristo. Justice is harsh for such transgressions of class — a legal clause &quot;allows the condemned man to choose between a tablet at the morgue-wall, where he&#x27;ll sleep away his thirty-year-and-one-day term&quot;, or &quot;remodeling&quot;, which means having his entire memory wiped. His father chooses remodeling. Difool soon begins to investigate the mystery of the disappearance of prostitutes&#x27; children, something he shouldn&#x27;t find out.

===&quot;Final Incal&quot;===
The story from the unfinished &quot;After the Incal&quot; was rewritten to provide a separate narrative for this volume. The story starts after &quot;The Incal&quot; climax, in which John Difool encountered a flowing-bearded divine being named Orh, witnessing a universe-shaking event, hurtling towards certain death in the acid lake. DiFool forgets about the cosmic encounter, and recovers his memory as the universe faces the threat of a metallic virus. The Prezident was cloned in a metallic body, equipped with both chemical and brutal weapons, but also an altered mind — operating under the influence of the &quot;destroyer of all living things&quot;, the Benthacodon (equivalent to &quot;The Incal&quot;&#x27;s Black Egg). He unleashes a destructive organic virus called the Biophage 13-X with the purpose of forcing the population to abandon their natural bodies in favor of robotic ones. The only way to counteract is to reunite John Difool with his true love, Luz de Garra (from &quot;Before the Incal&quot;), and the Elohim (a force of goodness) makes four John Difools from different realities to encounter each other on a quest to find her. The egos of the allegedly evolved guru Difool and the super-evolved &quot;angelic&quot; Difool are ridiculed, and the least enlightened Difool, the ugliest and most craven, is selected to save the universe. In the end, the cosmic humanity manages to become one collective consciousness, as true love saves it from turning into a collection of unfeeling metallic beings.

==Main characters==
* John Difool, protagonist: a Class R licensed private investigator and occasional bodyguard. Difool is reluctant to assume the role of hero, and suffers mood swings, self-doubt, and temper tantrums. He has a fondness for cigars, &quot;ouisky&quot;, and &quot;homeosluts&quot; (gynoid prostitutes). He is an everyman character, both unusually damning and praising of the human condition, kindly, sacrificing and selfish, likely to run away. His story is presented in &quot;Before the Incal&quot;: he is the son of a prostitute, and started as a PI while investigating on the children of the red ring prostitutes.
* Deepo, Difool&#x27;s loyal and good-hearted &quot;concrete seagull&quot;; generally smarter and more resourceful than John himself. Early in the story, the Light Incal gives him the power of speech.
* Animah and Tanatah, two sisters charged with guarding the Light and Dark Incals, respectively. In such duties, Tanatah hired the Metabaron to kill John DiFool and obtain the Light Incal. Animah, mother of Solune, who originally safeguarded the Light Incal, has psychic powers. Tanatah is also the head of the rebel group called the Amok.
* The Metabaron, the greatest bounty hunter, mercenary, and fighter ace in the known universe, and the adopted father of Solune; originally sent to kill John Difool by Tanatah. The Metabaron returned John in a frozen state without killing him, knowing that Tanatah would betray him.
* Solune (French words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;), the adopted child of the Metabaron and the biological child of Animah and John Difool. Like Animah, Solune has immense psychic powers, and was the chosen host of the power known as the Incal, destined to become the dual-gendered leader of the universe.
* Kill Wolfhead, an anthropomorphic wolf mercenary in Tanatah&#x27;s employ. Kill holds a grudge against DiFool, who pierced his ear with a bullet near the beginning of the story. He is portrayed as faithful, loyal, impulsive and aggressive.

==Analysis==
The center of the concept is Difool&#x27;s fantastic spiritual journey (or initiation) on a cosmic scale, which he is reluctant to accept; he constantly wishes to return to his own ignorant reality of simple hedonistic pleasures. It is an allegory for the sins repeating, the futility of complacency and the necessity for individual transformation. As the story progresses he keeps changing, becoming more heroic, even physically more handsome. The original six installments begin and end by DiFool falling from the bridge; he descends, ascends and later re-descends in &quot;closed&quot; circularity.

The universe is split into two galaxies, a human (with 22,000 planets), and a Berg (featherless birdlike aliens), and the story is set on four planets in the human galaxy: Ter21, Techno-Gea, Aquaend, and the Golden Planet.

On the planet Ter21 there are two social classes: the fortunate (common and aristocrats), who reside at the top, and the others (including the mutants led by Gorgo the Foul, who represent the poor living in misery, on the fringes of society, minorities of all kinds), who live down in the pits. At the top, it&#x27;s a near-panopticonical dystopia with standard TV program (with the same presenter Diavaloo) depicting filmed violence for public consumption, and indoctrination. Seemingly no one works anymore, and all life is mediated through the TriD (TV), even people&#x27;s dreams. People are addicted to &quot;love drug&quot; amorine, while the president is engaged in repeated body transplants. The masculine role is ridiculed by mass-produced holographic prostitutes. The technopriests represent the most damning, avaricious human drives.

John Difool is based upon The Fool from tarot with his name being a pun upon &quot;John, the Fool&quot;. Animah&#x27;s name is based on the Jungian concept of the anima, the feminine part of every male&#x27;s psyche, as well in Latin &quot;anima&quot; means &quot;psyche&quot;. The series has no taboos, an attitude towards sex, violence and general social stigmas that may be avoided in more conventional comics. They include black-and-white dualism or the conflict between good and evil, mystical symbolism, archetypes, metaphysics, tarot and other influences. In the story there&#x27;s often a conflict between life or nature and dead technology (even uniformity and diversity), as &quot;glasses enable you to see, that&#x27;s technology. But happiness is not that, it&#x27;s not your glasses. It&#x27;s what you are able to see. If you have wonderful glasses but don&#x27;t know how to see what&#x27;s in front of you, then that technological tool is useless&quot;. The series also showcases religion, economy, politics and warfare, all mixed together.

The &quot;Final Incal&quot; is kind of a call for revolt to organize life in a different way, because as individuals people are mortal, but as humanity itself they are immortal. To learn that others exist, to live together and give, that there is continuity only as part of humanity as a whole. It demonstrates that &quot;love is the ultimate purifier; a force that can cleanse, renew and revitalize&quot;.

==Style==
The series capture worlds with cityscapes, huge spacecraft and lands populated by technopriests, rubbish-dwelling mutants, doppelgängers, giant jellyfish, chiming forests of gems and jostling, old gurus floating on crystals, an underground rat army, flying leeches, &quot;necro-panzers&quot;, a selfish humanity among others. Some touches are borrowed directly from &quot;Dune&quot;: the Emperoress, a &quot;perfect androgyne&quot;, or Aquend, a planet composed entirely of water which is Arrakis&#x27;s seeming opposite, and a &quot;mentrek&quot; who betrayed his former master.

Jean Giraud&#x27;s (also known as Moebius) artwork and Yves Chaland&#x27;s colouring from &quot;The Incal&quot; were well praised. Jodorowsky initially didn&#x27;t have a script, but recounted and mimed the ideas to Moebius who sketched the scenario, recorded their conversation on tape, and they jointly altered the plot. Jon Evans considered resemblance to the De Stijl school of art inspired by artists like Piet Mondrian and Vilmos Huszár.

Moebius refused to do &quot;Before the Incal&quot;, thus Jodorowsky found Zoran Janjetov. Although Janjetov had his own style, he was influenced by Moebius and imitated him. Finally, Moebius decided to do &quot;After the Incal&quot;, but beside his illness at the time he had a different style, and Jodorowsky was not satisfied by the overall work. He depicted the nightmare of the tech-world with a more abundant sense of optimism, something peppered with light and hope throughout.

José Ladrönn&#x27;s rendition of the worlds that Moebius originally designed in the rewritten sequel &quot;Final Incal&quot; is much darker and grittier; the streets are emptier, less colorful, more muted. He excelled at drawing, but as if he has studied not only Moebius but also the movies that Moebius influenced, directly or indirectly (like &quot;Blade Runner&quot;).

==Publication history==
&quot;The Incal&quot; was initially serialized in French between 1980 and 1985 in the magazine &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, which was published by Les Humanoïdes Associés. An English translation was serialized in the magazine &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (published by National Lampoon) from 1982 to 1984. Concurrent with its serialization in &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot;, Les Humanoïdes Associés collected the series as six hardcover volumes: &quot;L&#x27;Incal Noir&quot; (1981), &quot;L&#x27;Incal Lumière&quot; (1982), &quot;Ce qui est en bas&quot; (1984), &quot;Ce qui est en haut&quot; (1985), &quot;La cinquième essenceGalaxie qui Songe&quot; (1988), and &quot;La cinquième essenceLa planète Difool&quot; (1988). In 1988, Epic Comics (a division of Marvel Comics) published &quot;The Incal&quot; in three volumes as a part of their &quot;Epic Graphic Novels&quot; line, with translation by Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier. 

Later, between 2001 and 2002, was republished a series of &quot;The Incal&quot; and &quot;Before the Incal&quot; in a twelve-issue limited series, with the former in two parts, &quot;Orphan of the City Shaft&quot; and &quot;John Difool, Class &quot;R&quot; Detective&quot;, between 2002 and 2003, while the first in two parts &quot;The Epic Conspiracy&quot; and &quot;The Epic Journey&quot; softcover trade format by Humanoids Publishing. The Humanoids Publishing initial version (of both &quot;The Incal&quot; and &quot;Before the Incal&quot;) was recolored in a more modern style and had the nudity censored. Jodorowsky did not like the change of the series to seduce a young audience.

In December 2010, Humanoids released a limited and oversized hardcover edition of &quot;The Incal&quot;, with 750 copies printed. It was sold out and soon the series was out of print in the United States. In 2011 more hardcovers were released by Humanoids Publishing in the US and Self Made Hero in the UK. Smaller than the oversized hardcover edition, they resemble it in that they restore the original colouring and remove the censorship. In 2012 Humanoids Publishing released 9.4 x 12.6&quot; limited deluxe edition of &quot;Before the Incal&quot; with a foreword by José Ladrönn, artist on the upcoming &quot;Final Incal&quot;. Between January 2013 and 2014, they released a sold-out 12 x 16&quot; limited coffee table edition of &quot;The Incal&quot; six volumes.

In 2014, Humanoids released 7.9 x 10.8&quot; hardcover trade collection of &quot;The Incal&quot; and its sequels, &quot;After the Incal&quot; and &quot;Final Incal&quot;, in one complete collection called &quot;Final Incal&quot;, as a 9.5 x 12.5&quot; deluxe slipcase hardcover, as well limited and numbered edition 12 x 16&quot; coffee table format. In 2015 they released a 7.9 x 10.8&quot; hardcover trade edition, but without &quot;After the Incal&quot;. All four volumes were digitally released by Humanoids Publishing in 2014.

Humanoids released three prequel graphic novels as part of the Incal Universe project, to which Alejandro Jodorowsky gave his blessing: &quot;Psychoverse&quot; by Mark Russell and Yanick Paquette, &quot;Dying Star&quot; by Dan Watters and Jon Davis-Hunt, and &quot;Kill Wolfhead&quot; by Brandon Thomas and Pete Woods. &quot;Psychoverse&quot; was released on November 15, 2022, while &quot;Kill Wolfhead&quot; was the English-language debut of &quot;Kill Tête-de-Chien&quot;, released on November 17 2021, in France. 

The series was translated from French into more than eleven languages, selling millions of copies.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in &quot;The 50 Best Non-Superhero Graphic Novels&quot; list placed the original volume as #30, calling it &quot;one of &quot;the&quot; great comics team-ups&quot;. Patrick Hess from Nothing But Comics placed it as fourth out of seventy best comics list, as &quot;there are very few comics ever created in the history of the medium that are this imaginative, this thoughtful, this heartfelt or this good&quot;.

Mark Millar called it &quot;quite simply one of the most perfect comics ever conceived and probably the most beautiful piece of graphic literature ever drawn&quot;.

Anthony Paletta from &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; considered that &quot;&quot;The Incal&quot; isn&#x27;t only a parade of thrilling grotesqueries: it also has a spiritual core that ... reflects Jodorowsky’s abiding idiosyncratic Buddhism&quot;, while &quot;Moebius’s work is simply some of the most beautiful not merely in his catalog, but in the comics world at large&quot;. He noted that the &quot;echoes of &quot;The Incal&quot; can also be found in the work of Hayao Miyazaki, Katsuhiro Otomo’s &quot;Akira&quot;, the decaying futurity of Ridley Scott’s &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and even depictions of Coruscant in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel films.

Daniel Kalder from &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; noted that the drawing by Moebius in &quot;After the Incal&quot; was of lesser ability, also saying: &quot;Moebius was and always will be The Man but he was not the man for this story: Ladrönn was. And so while &quot;After the Incal&quot; is certainly an intriguing footnote, a glimpse of a path not taken, &quot;Final Incal&quot; is the real deal&quot;.

Hugh Armitage from Digital Spy noted that Moebius&#x27;s &quot;After the Incal&quot; &quot;delivers some typically breathtaking scenery, but his characters take on a cartoonish, Sergio Aragonés-like style that is both atypical for the artist and at odds with the dark story. [Valérie] Beltran&#x27;s colours leave the images looking flat and uninteresting&quot;, and praised the Ladrönn&#x27;s artwork in &quot;Final Incal&quot;.

===Legal issues===
The publishers sued Luc Besson, director of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997), claiming that the film borrowed graphic and story elements from &quot;The Incal&quot;, but lost their case. In an interview given to Chilean newspaper &quot;The Clinic&quot;, Jodorowsky claimed that neither he nor Moebius actually sued Besson, but instead that the lawsuit was filed by the editor of the comic series. He further claimed that the case was lost because Moebius &quot;betrayed them&quot; by working directly with Besson on the production of the film. In a 2002 interview with the Danish comic book magazine &quot;Strip!&quot;, Jodorowsky considered it an honour that somebody stole his ideas.

==Adaptations==
In the 1980s the Canadian animation director Pascal Blais created a short trailer for &quot;The Incal&quot; (i.e. &quot;Dark Incal&quot;), but the movie was never made. In 2011 and 2016, his studio made updated versions of the original trailer.

In 2013, in an interview by France Inter, Nicolas Winding Refn was reportedly working as a director on a live-action movie adaptation of &quot;The Incal&quot;, but it appeared to have been a rumor that Winding Refn dismissed in 2016.

US black metal band Bihargam released the album &quot;Ove Tenebrae&quot; as a musical adaption of &quot;The Incal&quot; on October 16, 2020.

In 2021, Jodorowsky officially announced a big screen adaptation directed by Taika Waititi, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jemaine Clement and Peter Warren.

<doc id="1222640" wikidata="Q2896674" url="?curid=1222640" title="Defence of the Realm Act 1914">
<text>The Defence of the Realm Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. 29) (DORA) was passed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 1914, four days after the country entered the First World War. It was added to as the war progressed. It gave the government wide-ranging powers during the war, such as the power to requisition buildings or land needed for the war effort, and to make regulations creating criminal offences.

DORA ushered in a variety of authoritarian social control mechanisms, such as censorship: &quot;No person shall by word of mouth or in writing spread reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm among any of His Majesty&#x27;s forces or among the civilian population&quot; Anti-war activists, including John MacLean, Willie Gallacher, John William Muir, and Bertrand Russell, were sent to prison. The film, &quot;The Dop Doctor&quot;, was prohibited under the Act by the South African government with the justification that its portrayal of Boers during the Siege of Mafeking would antagonise Afrikaners.

The activities no longer permitted included flying kites, starting bonfires, buying binoculars, feeding wild animals bread, discussing naval and military matters and buying alcohol on public transport. Alcoholic drinks were watered down and pub opening times were restricted to 12 noon–3pm and 6:30pm–9:30pm. (The requirement for an afternoon gap in permitted hours lasted in England until the Licensing Act 1988.)

In 1920 DORA was extended to deal with the violence in Ireland (see Irish War of Independence) with the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920. That Act (under Section 3(6)) allowed military authorities to jail any Irish person without charge or trial and was repealed in 1953.

== Purpose==

Like most wartime acts, the Defence of the Realm Act was designed to help prevent potential invasion and to keep homeland morale at a high. It imposed censorship of journalism and of letters coming home from the front line. The press was subject to controls on reporting troop movements, numbers or any other operational information that would potentially be exploited by the Central Powers. People who breached the regulations with intent to assist the enemy or not would have been sentenced to death. 10 people were executed under the regulations.

== Amendments ==

Section 1(1) of the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 read as follows:



The original Act was amended and extended six times over the course of the war, first on 28 August 1914 by the Defence of the Realm (No. 2) Act 1914 (4 &amp; 5 Geo. 5. c. 63), then on 27 November 1914 by the Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act 1914 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. c. 8), which repealed and replaced the previous acts. It was amended three times in 1915, by the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) Acts 1915 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. cc. 34, 37 and 42).

The Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act 1914 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. c. 8) contained the following:

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Edward Hobart Seymour, (30 April 1840 – 2 March 1929) was a Royal Navy officer. As a junior officer he served in the Black Sea during the Crimean War. He then took part in the sinking of the war-junks, the Battle of Canton and the Battle of Taku Forts during the Second Opium War and then saw action again at the Battle of Cixi during the Taiping Rebellion.

Seymour went on to be Second-in-Command of the Channel Squadron and then Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves. After that he became Commander-in-Chief, China Station. During the Boxer Rebellion, he led an expedition of 2,000 sailors and marines from Western and Japanese warships to relieve the besieged diplomatic legations in Peking. The expedition was defeated by Chinese and Boxer forces and had to return to Tianjin. Although the mission had failed, when Seymour arrived back at Portsmouth he and his men were welcomed by thousands of people lining the beach and pier.

==Early career==
Born the son of the Reverend Richard Seymour and Frances Seymour (née Smith), Seymour was educated at Radley College and Eastman&#x27;s Royal Naval Academy, Southsea and joined the Royal Navy at Portsmouth in 1852. He was appointed to the corvette and, having been promoted to midshipman, then transferred to the paddle frigate in 1853. He served in HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; in the Black Sea throughout the Crimean War. He was appointed to the second-rate , flagship of his uncle Sir Michael Seymour, Commander-in-Chief, China Station in 1857 and took part in the sinking of the war-junks in June 1857, the Battle of Canton in December 1857 and the Battle of Taku Forts in May 1858 during the Second Opium War.

Seymour returned to Portsmouth and joined the steam frigate after which he attended the training ship and then the gunnery school . Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 4 May 1859, he returned to China and, during the voyage, was awarded the Royal Humane Society medal for an unsuccessful attempt to save a marine who had fallen overboard. Promoted to lieutenant on 11 February 1860, he joined the frigate , flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, and saw action again at the Battle of Taku Forts in August 1860. He became commanding officer of the paddle steamer at Canton and then transferred to the paddle sloop before joining the frigate , the new flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, and took part in the Battle of Cixi in September 1862 during the Taiping Rebellion.

Seymour became flag lieutenant to the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in 1863 and then joined the Royal Yacht in 1865. Promoted to commander on 5 March 1866, after a tour in a whaling ship to obtain experience of arctic waters, he joined the Coast Guard in Ireland in 1868 and then became commanding officer of the gunboat on the West Coast of Africa Station in June 1869. After taking part in operations against African pirates in 1870, he became commanding officer of the despatch vessel in the Channel Squadron in January 1872 and then of the despatch vessel later that year, also in the Channel Squadron.

Promoted to captain on 13 March 1873, Seymour spent a year at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and then became commanding officer of the troopship . He went on to be commanding officer of the cruiser in the Mediterranean Fleet in April 1880 and commanding officer of the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet in November 1882. He briefly commanded the converted liner when Russian forces seized Afghan territory in March 1885 during the Panjdeh Incident. He went on to be flag captain to the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth in May 1886 and, having been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887, he became assistant to the Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves in December 1887.

Promoted to rear-admiral on 14 July 1889, Seymour became Second-in-Command of the Channel Squadron, with his flag in the battleship , in April 1894. Promoted to vice-admiral on 9 November 1895, he became Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves later that year. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 22 June 1897.

==Commander-in-Chief, China Station==
===Boxer Rebellion===
Seymour became Commander-in-Chief, China Station, with his flag in the battleship , on 18 February 1898. In early 1900 the Boxers, a rural mass movement, decided to rid China of Western influence and in June 1900 they advanced on Peking, initiating the Boxer Rebellion. The diplomatic legations in Peking requested military support. On 9 June 1900 Sir Claude MacDonald the British Minister cabled Seymour, reporting that the situation in Beijing &quot;was hourly becoming more serious&quot; and that &quot;troops should be landed and all arrangements made for an advance to Peking at once.&quot; In response Seymour assembled a lightly armed force of 2,000 sailors and marines from Western and Japanese warships in Tianjin. The expedition headed for Beijing by train. Seymour&#x27;s force consisted of 916 British, 455 Germans, 326 Russians, 158 French, 112 Americans, 54 Japanese, 41 Italians, and 26 Austrians.

On the first day the allied force travelled twenty five miles without incident, crossing a bridge at Yancun over the Hai River unopposed although Chinese General Nie Shicheng and thousands of his soldiers were camped there. The next few days went slowly as Seymour had to repair railroad track and fight off Boxer attacks as his trains advanced. On 14 June 1900, several hundred Boxers armed with swords, spears, and clumsy gingals attacked Seymour twice and killed five Italian sailors who had been acting as pickets. The Americans counted 102 Boxer bodies left on the battlefield at the end of one battle.

On 16 June 1900 there was an allied European and Japanese attack on the Dagu Forts. As a result of the attack in Dagu, the Chinese government decided to resist Seymour&#x27;s expedition and kill or expel all foreigners in northern China. So, on 18 June 1900, Seymour&#x27;s force was suddenly attacked by several thousand well-armed Chinese Imperial soldiers – who had not opposed Seymour&#x27;s passage a few days earlier. The expedition fought off the attack, reportedly killing hundreds of Chinese at a loss of seven dead and 57 wounded. However, the need to care for the wounded, a shortage of supplies and ammunition, and the likelihood of additional Chinese attacks forced Seymour and his officers to decide on a retreat to Tianjin.

===Retreat===
Seymour turned his trains around and headed back toward Tianjin. But, he found the bridge across the Hai River he had crossed a few days before now destroyed by the Boxers or the Chinese army. The sailors, perhaps more comfortable near water, chose to follow the river – although the railroad route was shorter and ran through open country. Along the heavily populated river banks were Boxer-infested villages every one-half mile. Seymour&#x27;s retreat down the Hai River was slow and difficult, covering only three miles the first day. Additional casualties included John Jellicoe who suffered a near fatal wound. By 22 June 1900, the allies were out of food and down to less than 10 rounds of ammunition per man – except for the Americans who had brought ample ammunition. But, &quot;there was no thought of surrender,&quot; said Lieutenant Wurtzbaugh. &quot;The intention was to fight to the last with the bayonet.&quot; On 23 June 1900, six miles from Tianjin, Seymour came across the Xigu fort and arsenal which inexplicably was nearly undefended by Chinese soldiers. The foreign sailors and marines took refuge in the arsenal which contained a wealth of arms and ammunition and some food. Realizing its mistake in leaving the arsenal undefended, the Chinese army attempted to dislodge Seymour, now well-armed, but were unsuccessful.

A Chinese servant of the British slipped through to Tianjin and requested rescue for Seymour. Two thousand allied soldiers marched out of the city to the arsenal on 25 June 1900 and the next day escorted Seymour&#x27;s men back to Tianjin. The Chinese did not oppose their passage. A missionary reported their arrival in Tianjin. &quot;I shall never forget to my dying day, the long string of dusty travel-worn soldiers, who for a fortnight had been living on quarter rations, and fighting every day…the men were met by kind ladies with pails of tea which the poor fellows drunk as they had never drunk before – some bursting into tears.&quot; Seymour&#x27;s casualties were 62 dead and 232 wounded.

==Later career==
Promoted to full admiral on 24 May 1901, Seymour arrived back at Portsmouth where he was welcomed by thousands of people lining the beach and pier and honoured by a visit by the Lords of the Admiralty to his flagship. He had been advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) on 9 November 1900; in late September 1901 he was received in a personal audience by King Edward VII, who presented him with the insignia of the order. He was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle, First class, with the crossed swords in April 1902.

In May 1902, he was part of a delegation led by the Duke of Connaught to take part in the enthronement ceremonies in Madrid for the young King Alfonso XIII of Spain, and he was awarded the Spanish Crosses of Naval Merit.

Seymour was among the original recipients of the Order of Merit (OM) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and received the order from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. He was also appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King on 3 October 1902.

Promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 20 February 1905 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 15 May 1906, Seymour became commander of a squadron, with his flag in the battlecruiser , sent to attend celebrations in Boston in 1909. In November 1909 he was sworn in the Privy Council. He retired from the Navy in April 1910 and died at his home in Maidenhead on 2 March 1929.

<text>Margao is the commercial capital of the Indian state of Goa. It stands on the banks of the river Sal. It is the district headquarters of South Goa, and administrative headquarters of Salcete sub-district. It is Goa&#x27;s second largest city by population after Mormugao.

== Etymology ==
Margão is the Portuguese spelling, with Madgaon being used in Konkani. The etymology of the name has been debated, with theories ranging from the name having evolved from the pre-colonial Mahargao (village of Mahars, a community of weavers) to being derived from the Sanskrit (Maṭhagrāma, a village of monasteries) owing to the shrines of Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath in Ravanphond, now a suburb of Margao.

Alternatively, Margão may be derived from Mharuganv (village of demons), or Maravile, Portuguese for “marvellous village.”

== History ==

Prior to Portuguese rule, Margao was an important settlement and known as Maṭhagrāma (the village of monasteries) as it enshrined nine mathas in temple schools. Its replacement in 1579 was destroyed by raiders. The present church was built in 1675.

While the western side of the Holy Spirit Church developed as a market place, the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region.

===Câmara Municipal de Salcete===
The Municipality during the erstwhile Portuguese regime was known as &quot;Câmara Municipal de Salcete&quot;, catering to all the villages in Salcete Taluka for over 300 years until the Goa Municipalities Act of 1968 came into force. The Câmara Municipal de Salcete is now reconstituted into Margao Municipal Council. The Members of the Câmara Municipal de Salcete were then nominated by the Government, but after the reconstitution of the Municipal Council, the Members to all the 25 wards (13 in Margao &amp; 12 in Fatorda) are elected by the Members of the council.

Margao&#x27;s importance as an administrative and commercial area grew with the increasing dependence of the surrounding towns and villages; leading to the administrative center with the town hall at its center being built in the south.

<doc id="1222646" wikidata="Q3578647" url="?curid=1222646" title="Economy of North America">
<text>The economy of North America comprises more than 596 million people (8% of the world population) in its 24 sovereign states and 15 dependent territories. It is marked by a sharp division between the predominantly English speaking countries of Canada and the United States, which are among the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world, and countries of Central America and the Caribbean in the former Latin America that are less developed. Mexico and Caribbean nations of the Commonwealth of Nations are between the economic extremes of the development of North America.

Mexico lies in between these two extremes as a newly industrialized country (NIC), and is a part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), being one of the only two Latin American members of this organisation (together with Chile). The United States is by far the largest economy in North America and the largest national economy in the world.

The US, Canada and Mexico have significant and multifaceted economic systems. In 2011, the US has an estimated per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $47,200, and is the most technologically developed economy in North America. The United States&#x27; services sector comprises 80% of the country&#x27;s GDP (estimated in 2017), industry comprises 19.1% and agriculture comprises 0.9%.

Canada&#x27;s economic trends are similar to that of the United States, with significant growth in the sectors of services, mining and manufacturing. Canada&#x27;s GDP (PPP) was estimated at $39,400 in 2010. Canada&#x27;s services sector comprises 70.2% of the country&#x27;s GDP (estimated in 2017), industry comprises 28.2% and agriculture comprises 1.6%.

Mexico has a GDP (PPP) of $15,312, and per capita income is estimated at one-third of the United States&#x27;. The country has both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations, and is modernizing in sectors such as energy production, telecommunications and airports.

==Economic development==
===Great Depression===
The Great Depression began in North America in October 1929. The start is often dated to the stock market collapse of Black Tuesday although this was not the cause of the Great Depression. Canada and the United States experienced especially large declines, with the gross domestic product falling 37% from 1929 to 1933 in the United States, and 43% in Canada over the same period. The economy reached its lowest point in 1933, however recovery was slow. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 created demand for war materials that brought about the end of the depression.

The Great Depression spurred increased government intervention in the economy in North America. The United States introduced unemployment insurance, a minimum wage and standardised working hours under the New Deal. Canada introduced similar measures. Mexico nationalised some key industries during the Great Depression, with the railroads nationalised by 1937 and the oil industry nationalised in 1938.

===World War II===
Due to the large scale enlistment of men into armed forces during World War II, women entered the workforce en masse, filling many jobs in manufacturing and technical areas that had previously been closed to women. This led to the &quot;We can do it!&quot; campaign. The economic output in North America increased substantially, with unemployment practically eliminated in the United States. Rationing severely reduced the availability of consumer goods, with the increase in industrial production coming from the demand for war materials. During the peak of World War II activity, nearly 40 per cent of US GDP was devoted to war production.

===Cold War===
After the 2nd world war, the United States and Russia emerged as the world superpowers with both economies being strong and thus each country wanted to be recognised as a superpower. The relationship between the two countries further deteriorated with the space race.

===US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA - a new era of economic integration===
The Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1989 and the subsequent expansion to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) triggered a dramatic increase in trade between these three countries, with Mexican trade with the United States and Canada increasing threefold. Over 85% of Canadian exports in 2006 went to the United States.

==Regional variation==
With various climate zones, agricultural products vary from country to country. Job sectors are also different, with industrialized countries having more service workers, and developing countries relying on agriculture.

==Trade blocs==

===Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation===
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a group of Pacific Rim countries which meet with the purpose of improving economic and political ties. APEC&#x27;s stated goals are aimed at free and open trade and investments by cutting tariffs between zero and five percent in the Asia-Pacific area for industrialised economies by 2010 and for developing economies by 2020.

The organisation has members from four continents, those from North America are Canada, Mexico and the United States.

===Caribbean Community===
The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was created &quot;To provide dynamic leadership and service, in partnership with Community institutions and Groups, toward the attainment of a viable, internationally competitive and sustainable Community, with improved quality of life for all&quot;. Its secretariat is based in Georgetown, Guyana, South America.

- On January 1, 2006, six members: (Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago) unofficially ushered in the Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy (CSME).

- At the official signing of the protocol on January 30, 2006, in Jamaica, A further six members: (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) announced their intention to join by the second quarter of 2006. Montserrat, a British Oversees territory is awaiting approval by the United Kingdom. Haiti and the Bahamas have no immediate plans to join.

===Central American Free Trade Agreement===
The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The treaty is aimed at promoting free trade between its members. Canada and Mexico are negotiating membership.

===North American Free Trade Agreement===
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is an agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States to eliminate tariffs on goods traded between themselves.

Although currently only a trade agreement, with no supranational bodies or laws as in the European Union, there have been various proposals to move towards a customs union or a North American currency union. It is unknown whether this may eventually develop into a North American Union similar to that of Europe.

==Currency==

Below is a list of the currencies of North America, with exchange rates between each currency and both the &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;US dollars&quot; as of 20 July 2022. This list may vary as it is not current.

&quot;Table correct as of 20 July 2022&quot;

==Economic sectors==

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is very important in Central American and Caribbean nations. In western Canada, in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, wheat and other various main agricultural products are grown. The U.S. also has many states with significant agriculture production, mainly in the central continental U.S. Mexico produces many tropical fruits and vegetables as well as edible animals.

===Manufacturing===
North America has developed and its manufacturing sector has grown. In the beginning the European nations were the large manufacturing powers. At the start of the 1950s, the United States was a top manufacturing power, with Canada and Mexico also making significant progress.

===Service===
In Canada, the US and the Caribbean, service-based employment is a significant percentage of overall employment. Many people work in stores and other retail locations. In Canada more than 70% work in the services sector, with a similar percentage in the United States.

===Investment and banking===
The United States leads North America in investment and banking. Canada, Mexico and most recently, February 2011, El Salvador is growing in this sector. And smaller economic powers such as Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Panama are also growing slowly in this sector.

===Tourism===
Tourism is extremely important for the Caribbean economies, as they contain many beaches and have warm climates. Skiing in Canada and the US is also important. Tourism of national parks and natural landmarks, such as Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon in the United States, and Niagara Falls and Moraine lake in Canada, contribute to the economy in these regions.

<doc id="1222650" wikidata="Q5061022" url="?curid=1222650" title="Central Electricity Authority">
<text>The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) was a body that managed and operated the electricity supply industry in England and Wales between 1 April 1955 and 31 December 1957. The CEA replaced the earlier British Electricity Authority (BEA) as a result of the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act 1954, which moved responsibility for Scottish electricity supply to the Scottish Office.

== Structure ==
The structure of the management board and the personnel in post remained the same as the BEA with the exception of the removal of representation by the chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. There was a reduction from 14 to 12 of the number of area electricity boards – the South East Scotland Electricity Board and South West Scotland Electricity Board were removed from the CEA&#x27;s management. The functions of the remaining area boards were unchanged.

Upon its establishment in April 1955 the chairman of the CEA was Lord Citrine; the two deputy chairmen were Sir Henry Self and Josiah Eccles.

=== Appointments ===
Later appointments to the Central Electricity Authority by rotation between area boards were:

* N. Elliott, South Eastern Board, member from January 1956
* C. R. King, East Midlands Board, member from January 1956
* L. Howles, South Wales Board, member from January 1956
* D. H. Kendon, Merseyside and North Wales Board, member from January 1956.

The following were appointed to the board in 1956:

* G. A. S. Nairn, part-time member of North Wales Electricity Board since 1947, member
* Sir Leslie Nicholls, chairman Cable and Wireless, member
* Sir Henry Self, deputy chairman, reappointed
* G. H. E. Woodward, part-time member, reappointed.

The following were appointed to the board in 1957:

* J. D. Peattie, chief engineer of the board retired 31 January but retained as consultant
* F. H. S. Brown, was appointed chief engineer
* E. S. Booth, construction engineer was appointed deputy chief engineer
* J. C. Duckworth, was appointed deputy chief engineer (nuclear power)

== Operations ==

=== Electricity generation and sales ===
The electricity generated, supplied and sold by the CEA, in GWh, was as follows:

Note: import and export include bulk supplies from South of Scotland.

=== Customers ===
The numbers and types of CEA customers was as follows:
=== Employees ===
There was a total of 180,923 employees in the electricity supply industry 1956, this comprised:

* Managerial and higher executive: 1,335
* Technical and scientific: 15,480
* Technical staff trainees: 1,624
* Executive, clerical, accountancy and sales: 40,636
* Industrial: 115,934
* Apprentices:  5,914

=== Strategic issues ===
In addition to the routine operations of generating and transmitting electricity the Central Electricity Authority dealt with a number of strategic issues.

In the mid-1950s the National Coal Board estimated that it would be unable to supply the electricity industry’s projected demand for coal in the 1960s. Pressure was put on the CEA by the Ministry of Fuel and Power to adopt dual (coal and oil) firing in a large number of power stations being planned or then being constructed. The CEA believed that the cost of extra equipment and the high price of oil would make the scheme uneconomic. The CEA limited dual-firing to a small number of stations in the south of the country remote from coal fields.

In addition to coal and oil, nuclear power was under development in the 1950s. The newly constituted CEA had urgently needed to find suitable sites for the first nuclear stations. They had to be in the south of England near the major load centres, but away from major population areas. They needed to have good load-bearing properties for the heavy reactors and have an abundant source of water. Two sites were identified in Bradwell, Essex and Berkeley, Gloucestershire.

The Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) had encouraged major manufacturers of equipment – principally boilers and turbo-alternators – to form consortia to supply the nuclear power station contracts. The CEA was reluctant to give turnkey contracts to these consortia as it wished to retain control of design and ordering. Eventually the CEA vetted the designs but relied on the Atomic Energy Authority advice on the nuclear aspects.

The CEA were under pressure from government to accept a greater degree of future nuclear development than it thought was feasible. In 1956 the AEA considered that there were insufficient resources to meet 3,400 MW of future nuclear plant, but by the following year considered that 5,975 MW was possible. The CEA were concerned about the implications for their coal-fired programme and thought there would be an excessive surplus of coal-fired plant if the 6,000 MW nuclear power programme went ahead. It believed that 3,400 MW was a more realistic target. Nevertheless, in March 1957 the Cabinet approved a 6,000 MW programme of 19 nuclear power stations.

=== Research ===
The BEA had expanded the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead where the BEA/CEA had undertaken their own practical research on the ‘supergrid’, and on turbines and boilers. In the mid-1950s the CEA also commissioned research at universities on non-practical applications. These research contracts were placed on the advice of the authority&#x27;s Research Council.

=== Financial statistics ===
The financial income and expenditure of the CEA over its two full financial operating years (in £ million) was as follows:
== Organisational review ==
The devolution of power exemplified in the Electricity Reorganisation (Scotland) Act 1954 did not satisfy some quarters of the Conservative government who were critical of the over-centralisation in the industry. In July 1954 the Minister of Fuel and Power, Geoffrey Lloyd, appointed a departmental committee, chaired by Sir Edwin Herbert, to examine the efficiency and organisation of the industry and to make recommendations.

The Herbert committee reported in January 1956 and found that the Central Electricity Authority’s dual roles of electricity generation and supervision had led to central concentration of responsibility and to duplication between headquarters and divisional staff which led to delays in the commissioning of new stations. The committee&#x27;s recommendations were accepted by the government which enacted the Electricity Act 1957. This dissolved the Central Electricity Authority (and the Electricity Commissioners) and established the Electricity Council to oversee the industry and the Central Electricity Generating Board with responsibility for generation and transmission.

<text>Forfás () was the national policy advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation in Ireland. The agency was established in January 1994 under the Industrial Development Act, 1993 and was run by a board appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to whom the agency was responsible. Forfás was dissolved on 1 August 2014 and its functions were transferred to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland, the Industrial Development Authority and the Health and Safety Authority.

==Functions==

Legally, Forfás had five separate but related functions. It
* Provided independent and rigorous research, advice and support in the areas of enterprise and science policy. This work informed the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and wider Government in its responses to the fast-changing needs of the global business environment;
* Ensured the coherence of policies across the development agencies supporting enterprise;
* Evaluated enterprise policy interventions;
* Provided research and administrative support to independent advisory groups which currently include the:
**Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (ASC)
**Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN)
**Management Development Council (MDC)
**National Competitiveness Council (NCC)
In its day-to-day business, the primary function of Forfás was to analyse developments in areas concerning Ireland&#x27;s industrial and economic development and to make policy recommendations based on this analysis to Government. The Irish Government was not obliged to implement any recommendations that Forfás made. 
Additional functions included:

*Accreditation services of the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB). INAB provides services for the accreditation of calibration and testing laboratories in Ireland.
*Managing the national awareness programme, Discover Science and Engineering (DSE). DSE is the national science awareness programme for science, engineering, technology and innovation. The programme was managed by Forfás on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
*Provision of certain shared corporate services for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland;
*Hosting the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to Government.

As outlined above, Forfás also played a significant role in co-ordinating the activities of Government Enterprise Agencies (Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland).

==Governance==

===Board===

Forfás was ultimately a board of members that advised the Government. Members were appointed to the Board of Forfás by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and as provided for in the Industrial Development legislation. Under the Industrial Development Act 1993, the CEOs of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland were automatically board members of Forfás. By tradition, the Director General of FÁS and the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment were also board members. The Board also included a panel of business, economic, and other specialists.

===Executive===

While Forfás was a board, that board was supported by an executive of salaried employees. Forfás was the sole legal employer of staff in its own executive, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. Arising out of this, all staff employed in these bodies were Forfás employees seconded to such bodies. Upon retirement, Forfás assumed responsibility for their pension, resulting in Forfás having a large annual pensions cost and a significant liability under accounting standard FRS 17.

==Policy analysis and advice==

Forfás fulfilled its mandate through three policy divisions: 
* Competitiveness Division
* Enterprise Policy Division
* Science, Technology &amp; Human Capital Division

===Competitiveness===

The Competitiveness Division supported the Board of Forfás in providing advice to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the development agencies and other government departments. It had the following departments:
* National Competitiveness, Sustainability and Infrastructure Department
* Regulation, Trade and Policy Foresight Department
* Finance Department
* Systems/IT/Facilities Departments

===Enterprise policy===

The Enterprise policy departments of this division supported the Board of Forfás in providing advice to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on general enterprise development and related issues: It had the following three departments: 
* Enterprise Policy and Communications Department
* Tax/Finance/Employment and Surveys Department
* Discover Science and Engineering

===Science, Technology &amp; Human Capital===

This Division supported the Board of Forfás in providing advice to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the development and implementation of science, technology, innovation and human capital policy for economic and social well-being. The division also provided research and secretariat support to the Advisory Science Council, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the Management Development Council. It was made up of the following departments:
* Science, Technology and Basic Research Policy
* Enterprise Research and Development Policy
* Human Capital and Labour Market Policy

==Secretariat support==

Forfás provided the secretariat to a number of committees established by Government. These include:
* Advisory Council on Science &amp; Technology in Ireland (ACSTI)
* Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN)
* National Competitiveness Council (NCC)
* Management Development Council (MDC)

Forfás also provided support to the Enterprise Strategy Group, the Small Business Forum, the Business Regulation Forum and the Consumer Strategy Group.

==Discover Science and Engineering==

It also ran the Discover Science &amp; Engineering (DSE) programme on behalf of the Office of Science &amp; Technology. The programme bring together under one brand many of the existing national science, technology and engineering awareness activities and expands on these activities in a way that eliminates duplication and provides a more focused and effective communications strategy. The aim of the DSE programme is to encourage young people to consider careers in science, engineering and technology and, linked to that, to increase the numbers of students studying the physical sciences. In addition, the programme aims to raise the level of perception of science, technology, innovation and engineering among students and society in general. DSE runs numerous initiatives, including Science Week Ireland, Discover Primary Science, Greenwave and Science.ie.

==Irish National Accreditation Board==

The Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) has three main functions. It:
* Accredited organisations involved in the certification of quality and environmental management systems, products and personnel, laboratories involved in calibration and testing activities, certification and inspection bodies, attesters and attestation bodies
* Responsible for accreditation in accordance with the relevant International Organization for Standardization ISO 17000 series of standards and guides and the harmonised EN 45000 series of European standards
* Is the national statutory monitoring authority for GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) and EMAS (European Eco-Management and Audit Schemes)

==Other activities==
Forfás was responsible for the successful EMU Business Awareness Campaign in Ireland and related Loughrea Eurotown project and more recently, the Enterprise Strategy Group and the Consumer Strategy Group.

Forfás was the direct employer of all employees in the &#x27;development agencies&#x27;, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and also was the legal employer of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Irish Government.

<doc id="1222653" wikidata="Q1072272" url="?curid=1222653" title="Economy of South America">
<text>The economy of South America comprises approximately 434 million people living in the 12 sovereign states and three dependent territories of South America, which encompasses 6 percent of the world&#x27;s population. In 2025, South America ranks fourth in terms of nominal GDP by continent, behind Europe and after Africa and Oceania. 

South America has two major trade blocks: Mercosur and the Andean Community. Brazil is the largest economy in South America in terms of Nominal GDP, it has a vast and diverse economic landscape encompassing agriculture, manufacturing, services, and natural resources. Due to Brazil&#x27;s major economy, it has a large influence over its neighbors, and even globally. Argentina which is South America&#x27;s second largest economy, boasts a rich history of industrialization and a well-developed agricultural sector. Despite economic challenges and very high inflation, Argentina uses its abundant natural resources and skilled workforce to drive economic growth and innovation. Together, Brazil and Argentina serve as economic powerhouses and as such, are major influences to surrounding countries. Uruguay stands out as it boasts the highest GDP per capita in the region. Renowned for its stable political environment, strong social welfare system, and diversified economy, Uruguay has consistently ranked among the top nations in terms of human development and standard of living. Uruguay has a large agriculture sector and has made previous strategic investments in technology and innovation, Uruguay&#x27;s economy thrives on both domestic consumption and international trade. Guyana ranks second which is attributed to its oil and gas sector.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===
From the 1930s to the 1980s, countries in South America used import substitution, an economic policy that replaces foreign businesses as well as imports with domestic production. This was a policy made to increase domestic manufacturing. Furthermore, national spending on arms soared during periods of military rule. Increasingly, South American countries began to borrow from foreign private banks and international lending institutions, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, to fund existing programs while also trying to expand their economic productivity through investments. However, this policy created a debt crisis in South America.

The continent has fallen further behind North America over the past two centuries. This can be explained by South America&#x27;s high concentration on primary commodities as well as the state of the educational system and institutional structure, some of which are still related to its colonial past, others to recent political developments.

From the 1990s on, countries in South America switched over to the free-market economy system. Now, major economic activities include agriculture, industry, forestry, and mining.

=== 21st century ===
In 2016, four countries, which include Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, and Venezuela, experienced a decline in output. Other countries in the region were observing a slowdown in growth rates. Brazil saw this decline in output due to increasing unemployment levels, worsening financial conditions, and political issues, which, in turn, led to a decrease in private domestic consumption and investment. Argentina also experienced a recession in private consumption and investment; however, it was because of the removal of public service subsidies due to a short-term rise in inflation. In contrast, Peru differed from other countries in the region, demonstrating an increase in growth rates thanks to copper production.

In 2017, the economy started to recover for the first time since 2014. The main contributor to economic growth is private consumption. Increased retail trade and industrial production in Brazil have led to an expansion of its economy by 1% in 2017. Higher public investments and private consumption have resulted in the growth of the economy of Argentina compared to its recession in 2016.

In 2017, inflation rates were observed to be on a downward trend in most of the major economies. The reasons are prior exchange rate appreciations and food price deflation. Some countries are even expected to lower their target bands in 2019.

In 2018, South America&#x27;s economy showed mixed results due to political instability, fluctuating commodity prices, and structural challenges. Brazil experienced modest recovery but faced investor uncertainty amid elections. Argentina struggled with high inflation and recession, securing a $57 billion IMF bailout. Venezuela&#x27;s economy collapsed further under hyperinflation and declining oil production. In contrast, Chile, Peru, and Colombia maintained stable growth, driven by mining exports and infrastructure investment. Dependency on commodities and political corruption remained key vulnerabilities. The region&#x27;s GDP growth averaged 0.6%, reflecting uneven economic performance.

=== Agriculture ===

Throughout history, since the colonial period, the export of natural resources has been a key factor for South America&#x27;s economy. With a land that can be divided into four climatic regions (tropical, temperate, arid and cold), South America is a diverse land rich in natural resources. It has a wide variety of agricultural products, mineral wealth, plentiful freshwater and rich fisheries.

As one of the most important contributors of the world&#x27;s agricultural market, South America accounts for approximately 10% of the global agricultural product export. The different climatic regions are home for diverse types of crops. In the tropical climatic regions, two of the most important cash crops are coffee and cacao. South America dominates the global market in coffee production, having Brazil as the world&#x27;s largest exporter of coffee. A report from the Council of Brazilian Coffee Exporters showed that the coffee industry earned US$5.4 billion in 2016, with the exports of different coffee varieties exceeding 34 million 60 kg bags. This accounts to 6.4% of Brazil&#x27;s total annual agrobusiness exports of US$84.9. The report showed that by December 2016, the Brazilian coffee industry generated US$557 million in revenue by exporting 3.07 million bags of coffee. Additionally, in 2016 soybeans, grown in South America&#x27;s temperate climates, had an export value of US$19B for Brazil, representing 10.4% of the total exports, and one of US$3.23B for Argentina, representing 5.7% of the country&#x27;s total exports. Moreover, the soybean meal exportation represent 17.5% of Argentina&#x27;s total exports, with an export value of $9.96B.

Other exports from the tropical regions, such as the Amazon rainforest (contained within Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia French Guiana and Suriname), include cashews and Brazil nuts, globally regarded as delicacies, as well as sugar (sugarcane), avocados, bananas, pineapples, oranges, grapefruits, and mangoes. The sugarcane cultivation has been the backbone of the economy since early colonial times, and Ecuador is the world&#x27;s largest banana exporter (Banana Production in Ecuador)

In the temperate regions, maize (corn) is produced and it is the second most exported product in Argentinas. Additionally in cold climatic regions such as the Andes, there is a high production of crops such as quinoa, increasingly valued internationally, as well as the grazing of llamas, vicuñas and alpacas. These animals are bred for their wool and it is exported globally as a high-quality textile.

The four countries with the strongest agriculture are Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia. Currently:
* Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee, orange, guaraná, açaí and Brazil nut; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, papaya, tobacco, pineapple, banana, cotton, beans, coconut, watermelon, lemon and yerba mate; is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, avocado, tangerine, persimmon, mango, guava, rice, oat, sorghum and tomato; and is one of the top 15 world producers of grape, apple, melon, peanut, fig, peach, onion, palm oil and natural rubber;

=== Animal husbandry ===
Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of chicken meat: 3.77 million tons in 2019. The country is the holder of the second largest herd of cattle in the world, 22.2% of the world herd. The country was the second-largest producer of beef in 2019, responsible for 15.4% of global production. It was also the 3rd largest world producer of milk in 2018. This year, the country produced 35.1 billion liters. In 2019, Brazil was the 4th largest pork producer in the world, with almost 4 million tons.

In 2018, Argentina was the 4th largest producer of beef in the world, with a production of 3 million tons (behind only USA, Brazil and China). Uruguay is also a major meat producer. In 2018, it produced 589 thousand tons of beef.

In chicken meat production, Argentina ranks among the 15 largest producers in the world, and Peru and Colombia are among the 20 biggest producers. In beef production, Colombia is one of the 20 largest producers in the world. In honey production, Argentina ranks among the 5 largest producers in the world, and Brazil among the 15 largest. In terms of production of cow&#x27;s milk, Argentina ranks among the 20 largest producers in the world.

=== Industry ===

The World Bank annually lists the top manufacturing countries by total manufacturing value. According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the thirteenth most valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion), Venezuela the thirtieth largest (US$58.2 billion, however, it depends on oil to obtain this value), Argentina the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion), Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion), Peru the 50th largest (US$28.7 billion) and Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion).

80% of the manufacturing of the Latin America region falls on Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

Brazil has the third-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil&#x27;s industries range from automobiles, steel, and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft (Embraer), food, pharmaceutical, footwear, metallurgy and consumer durables. In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world. In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp in the world and the 8th producer of paper. In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked 4th among world producers. In 2019, the country was the 8th producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world. In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world. In textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the 5 largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated in world trade. In the aviation sector, Brazil has Embraer, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, behind Boeing and Airbus.

In 2019, Argentina was the 31st world producer of steel, the 28th producer of vehicles, the 22nd world producer of beer, the 4th world producer of soybean oil and the 3rd world producer of sunflower oil, among other industrial products.

=== Mining ===

Mining is one of the most important economic sectors in South America, especially for Chile, Peru and Bolivia, whose economies are highly dependent on this sector. The continent has large productions of gold (mainly in Peru, Brazil and Argentina); silver (mainly in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina); copper (mainly in Chile, Peru and Brazil); iron ore (Brazil, Peru and Chile); zinc (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil); molybdenum (Chile and Peru); lithium (Chile, Argentina and Brazil); lead (Peru and Bolivia); bauxite (Brazil); tin (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil); manganese (Brazil); antimony (Bolivia and Ecuador); nickel (Brazil); niobium (Brazil); rhenium (Chile); iodine (Chile), among others.

Brazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where it is the 2nd largest producer and exporter in the world – iron ore is usually one of the 3 export products that generate the greatest value in the country&#x27;s trade balance), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the 5 largest producers in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium (concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.

Chile contributes about a third of the world copper production. In addition to copper, Chile was, in 2019, the world&#x27;s largest producer of iodine and rhenium, the second largest producer of lithium and molybdenum, the sixth largest producer of silver, the seventh largest producer of salt, the eighth largest producer of potash, the thirteenth producer of sulfur and the thirteenth producer of iron ore in the world.

In 2019, Peru was the 2nd largest world producer of copper and silver, 8th largest world producer of gold, 3rd largest world producer of lead, 2nd largest world producer of zinc, 4th largest world producer of tin, 5th largest world producer of boron and 4th largest world producer of molybdenum.

In 2019, Bolivia was the 8th largest world producer of silver; 4th largest world producer of boron; 5th largest world producer of antimony; 5th largest world producer of tin; 6th largest world producer of tungsten; 7th largest producer of zinc, and the 8th largest producer of lead.

In 2019, Argentina was the 4th largest world producer of lithium, the 9th largest world producer of silver, the 17th largest world producer of gold and the 7th largest world producer of boron.

Colombia is the world&#x27;s largest producer of emeralds. In the production of gold, among 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, breaking a record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. The country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world. In the production of silver, in 2017 the country extracted 15,5 tons.

=== Oil and gas ===

In the production of oil, Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Venezuela was the 21st largest, with 877 thousand barrels / day, Colombia in 22nd with 886 thousand barrels / day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels / day and Argentina 29th with 507 thousand barrels / day. As Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (where it produced 2.5 million barrels / day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investments.

In the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1524 bcf (billion cubic feet), Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379.

In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, Brazil exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism in South America is still little evolved: in Europe, for example, countries obtain annual tourist values such as U $73.7 billion (Spain), or U $67.3 billion (France). While Europe received 710 million tourists in 2018, Asia 347 million and North America 142.2 million, South America received only 37 million, Central America 10.8 million and the Caribbean 25.7 million.
* 

Please note that the number of tourists does not always reflect the monetary amount the country gets from tourism. Some countries carry out higher levels of tourism, obtaining more benefits.

== Transport ==

=== Roads and highways ===

Transport in South America is basically carried out using the road mode, the most developed in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is usually treated in a secondary way.

Brazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116. Argentina has more than 600,000 km of roads, of which about 70,000 km are paved, and about 2,500 km are divided highways. The three most important highways in the country are Route 9, Route 7 and Route 14. Colombia has about 210,000 km of roads, and about 2,300 km are divided highways. Chile has about 82,000 km of roads, 20,000 km of which are paved, and about 2,000 km are divided highways. The most important highway in the country is the Route 5 (Pan-American Highway) These 4 countries are the ones with the best road infrastructure and with the largest number of double-lane highways.

Due to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).

=== Airports ===
There are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country – the airport connects São Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus, among others. Argentina has important international airports such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bariloche, Mendoza, Salta, Puerto Iguazú, Neuquén and Usuhaia, among others. Chile has important international airports such as Santiago, Antofagasta, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Iquique, among others. Colombia has important international airports such as Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Cali and Barranquilla, among others. Other important airports are those in the capitals of Uruguay (Montevideo), Paraguay (Asunción), Peru (Lima), Bolivia (La Paz) and Ecuador (Quito). The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).

=== Ports ===
About ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí, Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valparaíso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).

=== Railways ===

The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It&#x27;s basically used for transporting ores. The Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000 km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. Chile has almost 7,000 km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has only about 3,500 km of railways.

=== Waterways ===

Among the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas Gerais) and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In Argentina, the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are Zárate and Campana. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country.

== Energy ==
===Brazil===


The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country&#x27;s oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country&#x27;s demand. In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.

Brazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country&#x27;s energy generation. In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).

In 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region&#x27;s installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil&#x27;s generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region&#x27;s installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil&#x27;s hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.

 according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%. While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%; the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior. In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country. In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country&#x27;s current demand. In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany.

Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil&#x27;s electricity. The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.

 according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%. Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (&quot;Minas Gerais&quot;), BA (&quot;Bahia&quot;) and GO (Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records. In 2019, solar power represented 1,27% of the energy generated in the country. In 2021, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13 GW), and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).

In 2020, Brazil was the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.

=== Other countries ===
After Brazil, Colombia is the country in South America that most stands out in energy production. In 2020, the country was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2015 it was the 19th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 40th largest producer in the world. Colombia&#x27;s biggest highlight is in coal, where the country was, in 2018, the world&#x27;s 12th largest producer and the 5th largest exporter. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 45th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (0.5 GW), 76th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.1 GW) and 20th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW). Venezuela, which was one of the world&#x27;s largest oil producers (about 2.5 million barrels/day in 2015) and one of the largest exporters, due to its political problems, has had its production drastically reduced in recent years: in 2016, it dropped to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, reaching only 300,000 barrels/day at a given point. The country also stands out in hydroelectricity, where it was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed capacity in 2020 (16,5 GW). Argentina was, in 2017, the 18th largest producer in the world, and the largest producer in Latin America, of natural gas, in addition to being the 28th largest oil producer; although the country has the Vaca Muerta field, which holds close to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, and is the second largest shale natural gas deposit in the world, the country lacks the capacity to exploit the deposit: it is necessary capital, technology and knowledge that can only come from offshore energy companies, who view Argentina and its erratic economic policies with considerable suspicion, not wanting to invest in the country. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 27th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (2.6 GW), 42nd in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.7 GW) and 21st in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW). The country has great future potential for the production of wind energy in the Patagonia region. Chile, although currently not a major energy producer, has great future potential for solar energy production in the Atacama Desert region. Paraguay stands out today in hydroelectric production thanks to the Itaipu Power Plant. Bolivia stands out in the production of natural gas, where it was the 31st largest in the world in 2015. Ecuador, because it consumes little energy, is part of OPEC and was the 27th largest oil producer in the world in 2020, being the 22nd largest exporter in 2014.

<doc id="1222656" wikidata="Q3578653" url="?curid=1222656" title="Economy of Oceania">
<text>The economy of Oceania comprises more than 14 separate countries and their associated economies.

On a total scale, Oceania has approximately 34,700,201 inhabitants who are spread among 30,000 islands in the South Pacific bordered between Asia and the Americas. This region has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of Australia and New Zealand to the much less developed economies that belong to many of its island neighbours.

==Trade blocs==
The smallest Pacific nations rely on trade with Australia, New Zealand and the United States for exporting goods and for accessing other products.

Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s trading arrangements are known as Closer Economic Relations. Australia and New Zealand, along with other countries, are members of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East Asia Summit (EAS), which may become trade blocs in the future particularly EAS.

== Currency ==

The below table summarizes the official currencies of Oceania. Several territories are dollarized or use a currency with a fixed exchange rate.

==Economic sectors==

===Service industry===
The overwhelming majority of people living in the Pacific islands work in the service industry which includes tourism, education and financial services. Oceania&#x27;s largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States and South Korea. The majority of people living in Australia, and to a lesser extent, New Zealand work in mining, electrical and manufacturing sectors also.

===Manufacturing===
The manufacturing of clothing is a major industry in some parts of the Pacific, especially Fiji, although this is generally decreasing.

Australia boasts the largest amount of manufacturing in the region, producing cars, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.

===Tourism===
Tourism has become a large source of income for many in the Pacific; tourists come from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Fiji currently draws almost half a million tourists each year; more than a quarter from Australia. This contributes $1 billion or more since 1995 to Fiji&#x27;s economy but the government of Fiji underestimate these figures due in part to an invisible economy inside the tourism industry.

===Agriculture and fishing===
Agriculture and natural resources constitutes only 5% to 10% of Oceania&#x27;s total jobs, but contributes substantially to export performance. The most populous two nations, Australia and New Zealand, are also the most developed and have majority service industries. This dilutes the data from the less developed Pacific Island nations who have major agricultural economies. Most of the Pacific countries (excluding Australia and New Zealand) the primary industry is agriculture. Many nations are still quintessentially agricultural; for example, 80% of the population of Vanuatu and 70% of the population of Fiji works in agriculture. The main produce from the pacific is copra or coconut, but timber, beef, palm oil, cocoa, sugar and ginger are also commonly grown across the tropics of the Pacific. Fishing provides a major industry for many of the smaller nations in the Pacific, although many fishing areas are exploited by other larger countries, namely Japan. Natural Resources, such as lead, zinc, nickel and gold, are mined in Australia and the Solomon Islands. Oceania&#x27;s largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, India, South Korea and the European Union.

===International aid and charity===

====Oceanian donor nations====
Oceania&#x27;s most populous nations, Australia and New Zealand, are both highly developed nations and are large international aid donors. These two wealthy nations share the region with less developed nations which still rely on foreign aid for development. In the 2007/08 financial year Australia provided $3.155 billion worth of official development assistance, of which $2.731 billion will be managed by AusAID. Every week, each Australian puts in around $2.40 to pay for Australia&#x27;s aid program, amounting to around 1% of the Australian Federal Government expenditure compared to the 42% spent on social security and welfare.

====Oceanian recipient states====
In the Solomon Islands 50% of government spending is paid for by international donors; namely Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan and the Republic of China (Taiwan).

==Global trade relations==
This region consists of many trading relations because of the small amount of land and limited resources they have. Many have trading economies and are transitioning to a developed economy and infrastructure.

<text>The Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) was a non-ministerial government department in the United Kingdom. It was established under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) to reduce crime by confiscating the proceeds of any crime. It was granted a new power of civil recovery through the High Court, and could also take over the powers of the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to levy tax without identifying a source for taxed income.

The ARA became operational in February 2003, but it failed to meet its targets for the confiscation of criminal funds. It was announced in January 2007 that it would be merged with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), which was established in 2006. Provisions to achieve this were contained in the Serious Crime Act 2007. There were also proposals for other law enforcement agencies, such as HMRC, to be given similar powers of civil recovery at the same time. On 1 March 2008, the transfer of the Director and staff of the Assets Recovery Agency, its property, rights and liabilities to SOCA and the National Policing Improvement Agency started in anticipation of the Agency&#x27;s abolition. The agency ceased to exist on 1 April 2008.

==Background==
The setting up of the ARA was a key aspect of the POCA, which the Government intended to take the profit out of crime, aiming to dismantle and disrupt organised crime gangs by confiscating the financial proceeds of criminal acts. It brings together previous legislation, such as the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 and Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, with the changes recommended in a comprehensive report of a study conducted by the Performance and Innovation Unit of the Cabinet Office in 2000.

POCA strengthened the legislation relating to seizures of cash, money laundering, investigatory powers, and restraint and confiscation procedures. Previously, only profits from certain crimes, such as drug trafficking, were liable to confiscation.

The Agency had three strategic aims:
* To disrupt organised criminal enterprises through the recovery of criminal assets, thereby alleviating the effects of crime on communities.
* To promote the use of financial investigation as an integral part of criminal investigation, within and outside the Agency, domestically and internationally, through training and continuing professional development.
* To operate the Agency in accordance with its vision and values.

==Powers==
The powers of the ARA were mostly limited to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, although its taxation powers extended to Scotland. Its main offices were in London, with a second office Belfast. In Northern Ireland, the Director consulted with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In Scotland, civil recovery was achieved through the Civil Recovery Unit of the Scottish Government.

The functions of the ARA were categorised into four types:
*Confiscation proceedings;
*Civil recovery proceedings;
*Taxation of income or gains which are suspected of being derived from criminal activities;
*Control and supervision of the training of financial investigators in the UK.

==Director==
The ARA was headed by a Director, the first of whom was Jane Earl. Alan McQuillan, a former Assistant Chief Constable in the R.U.C., was appointed as the new director in 2007. The Director had to carry out his statutory functions with a view to the reduction of crime. The Director reported to the Home Secretary, but was operationally independent.

By 2005, it had 180 staff, and an annual budget of £15.5m, but it recovered only £4.6m. It had more success in freezing criminal&#x27;s assets, with £68.45m frozen in June 2006, but found its actions were frustrated by lengthy and expensive court cases.

<text>Western Springs Stadium is a stadium in Auckland, New Zealand. Built within a natural amphitheatre, it is primarily used for rugby union matches during the winter and for speedway racing during the summer. It is also occasionally used for large concerts and festivals.

Western Springs Stadium has a crowd capacity of 20,000 for sports and 49,000 for concerts. It is located west of the city centre in the suburb of Western Springs.

==History==
Western Springs Stadium was built on land purchased from the Motion family by Auckland City Council in 1875 in order to build the Western Springs reservoir and pump station. Situated in a natural amphitheatre, concrete terracing was constructed. It was designed and modelled on European stadiums which included a banked concrete cycling track, a cinder running track, and a grassed centre area for football and sports. The original design included a covered grandstand which would fill the gap between the concrete terraces, the cycling track finishing straight was designed and built to start and finish in front of the proposed grandstand (where the pit area now is). The stadium was never completed.

In 1929, the stadium built by Relief Labour was opened to serve cycling, athletics and football sports. The cycling track was over 500 yards in circumference as the European tracks were then. The cinder all weather Athletic 440-yard running track was the first of its type in NZ and it with the overall stadium would have easily compared to the famous Wembley Stadium in England. Some conjecture has been made when motorcycle speedway commenced on Western Springs. Saroway Park Newmarket was being used at the time. Previously, the Mt. Albert volcanic crater had been used. It was not until 1935 Motorcycle broadsiding commenced on the cinder running track (as they did on Wembley). On Christmas Day December 1937 midget car racing was introduced at a special international meeting, it included NZ pioneers Ron Roycroft and Geo Smith. The first official season then followed in January 1938. Speedway was still being raced at the previous venue at the Epsom Showgrounds. Athletics disappeared from Western Springs as a result and New Zealand&#x27;s only all weather Athletics track was replaced by the traditional grass tracks until the late 1960s. When the first of the new style all weather athletics tracks were built Western Springs was already many years ahead of its time with an all weather cinder surface laid in 1929.

The 1950s saw promoters &quot;take over&quot; with the blessing of the Auckland City Council pleased to receive a monetary return. The early promoters combined Cycling, Motorcycle Speedway and Speedway Cars who all raced together on the same programme with a large following. The war intervened and in 1944 Speedway became a huge entertainment and the formula of Cycling, Speedway Bikes and Midgets reached international heights.

Speedway previously had competed on Epsom Showgrounds, Blanford Park on the old cycling track around the soccer field (now under the Grafton Gully motorway) and Olympic Park (Saraway Park) in Newmarket.

Stock car promoters raised the height of the speedway/running track introducing stock cars and forcing speedway motorcycling out, who relocated to Rosebank Road. Speedway cars were affected at this time by a conflict with Stock Car promoters. During the 1960s, cycling was forced out of the stadium as the promoters in tandem with the Auckland City Council made access difficult and later impossible under the requirements of the speedway track. The Auckland City Council had little regard for Amateur sports such as Cycling and Athletics, nor for the stadium itself, never completing the complex and building the Grandstands. Neglect reached its nadir when the main concrete terraces slipped away during the 1960s, almost taking the cycling track with it. It took months to effect repairs; under strong public criticism they finally did some thing to re-instate the damaged terraces. The surrounding stadium grounds deteriorated into a Council yard with derelict equipment and buildings littering the boundary of the site which spread to the adjoining Lake and Pump House and abandoned relief campsite. Speedway Cars resurged into a new golden era when stock cars went to Gloucester Park and finally Waikaraka Park.

Because cycling was forced out, the cycling track was never able to be used again, so it was removed to widen the new speedway midget race track; at the same time, smaller cycling velodrome track sizes became the International requirement.

The 1960s saw a brief return of what the stadium concept originally was; this was assisted by the Speedway promoter who laid the athletic track. On the success of Peter Snells&#x27; Olympic victories an International Athletic and Cycling event was held with the largest crowd recorded for the stadium. It was larger than the 1950 British Empire Games cycling events and Closing Ceremony.

In February 2007, the WWE Road To Wrestlemania 23 Tour came to Western Spring attracting over 12,000 WWE fans.

==Speedway==
Western Springs Stadium has been used for speedway since 30 November 1929 when motorcycling (broad siding) was introduced. Midget Car racing started in December 1937 with an International race including New Zealand pioneers Ron Roycroft and Geo Smith. The first full speedway season started in January 1938. With the war years, there was a break until 1944 when speedway with cycling, motor cycling and midget cars became the major entertainment event during the summer months in Auckland.

The site has hosted many significant events, including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship and the New Zealand Solo Championship on 15 occasions from in 1931 to 1989.

On 31 March 2012, Western Springs Stadium played host to the opening round of the 2012 Speedway Grand Prix, the first time the Speedway Grand Prix (SGP) has ever been held in New Zealand. The long track was one of the longest tracks ever used in the SGP series. The SGP of New Zealand was held in 2012, 2013 and 2014 before being cut from the 2015 Speedway Grand Prix series. The speedway announced that 2020/2021 season races are being streamed live on the internet to subscribers of United States–based FloRacing.

In 2024, the venue celebrated its 95th year of speedway but due to noise complaints and legal action from a local residents group, speedway events have been limited to 12 per season.

==Rugby==
Between late March and early October, the stadium is used by the Ponsonby RFC for training and games.

==Concerts==

Two concerts held at the stadium were the largest concerts ever in New Zealand at the time. On 26 November 1983, one of the final dates of David Bowie&#x27;s Serious Moonlight Tour was attended by either 74,480 fans (according to bootleg recordings) or by 83,000 (according to the promoter years later). On 14 March 1987, over 80,000 fans saw the concert by ZZ Top.

Other artists who have performed at the venue range from Six60 (2019, 2020), Led Zeppelin (1972), Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers (1979), Elton John (1971, 1974, 1982, 1984 and 1990) to AC/DC (2010 and 2015). Including shows by Deep Purple 13/11/75, Alice Cooper 4/4/77, Rod Stewart 22/2/79, ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) 29/1/78, KISS 3/12/80, Fleetwood Mac 6/11/1977 and 22/3/80, Stevie Wonder 11/4/81 (weather delayed Monday), Bon Jovi 19/09/87, David Bowie 28/11/87, Pink Floyd 22/01/88, Mick Jagger 5/11/88, The Rolling Stones 17/4/95, Genesis 23/11/86, Paul McCartney 27/3/93, Bruce Springsteen 28/03/03.

At the top of the hill that forms the amphitheatre is a street of houses – the residents have a view into the stadium from their back gardens. This has often been referred to by the artists on stage, who have often encouraged the residents to donate money to charity in lieu of an entrance fee – notably, Bono from U2 (1989) and Robbie Williams (2003). In 1993&#x27;s ZooTV show, Bono made a mid-performance phone call to one of the neighbouring properties with a grandstand built in the backyard overlooking the stadium, and earlier in the day the band had sent up a selection of tour merchandise to attempt to sell to the viewers.

In January 2014, Western Springs was the venue for the Big Day Out, with a reported 40,000+ in attendance. It was the festival&#x27;s first return to Auckland since Mount Smart Stadium in 2012 but the final time the Big Day Out was held in Auckland.

On 15 February 2014, rapper Eminem performed at the venue for an estimated 55,000 fans. It was his first in the country and is the first to be headlined by a rap act in the venue&#x27;s history.

<text>Calu () is an epithet of the Etruscan chthonic fire god [[Śuri]] as god of the underworld, roughly equivalent to the Greek god Hades (; ); moreover, as with Hades, this god-name was also used as a synonym for the underworld itself.

He is identified by his wolf attributes, such as a wolf-like appearance or a human with a wolf-skin cap.
The visual representations of the cult of Calu seem to contain common elements with the Roman cult of Lupercalia and the Faliscan cult of the Hirpi Sorani (&quot;wolves of Soranus&quot;, from ).

<text>The Somaliland shilling (, ; abbreviation: Sl.Sh. or SLSH; symbol: [[Slash (punctuation)|/-]]) is the official currency of the Republic of Somaliland, an unrecognised state in the Horn of Africa, recognised internationally as &quot;de jure&quot; part of Somalia.

==Overview==
The shilling has been the currency of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the East African shilling was introduced to the former British Somaliland protectorate. Following the 1960 independence and unification of the former territories of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, their respective currencies, the East African shilling and somalo (which were equal in value) were replaced at par in 1962 by the Somali shilling. Names used for its denominations were cent (singular: centesimo; plural: centesimi) and سنت (plural: سنتيمات), along with shilling (singular: scellino; plural: scellini) and شلن.

In September 1994, the Parliament of Somaliland endorsed President Egal&#x27;s plans to introduce a new currency to replace the Somali shilling. The Somaliland shilling was introduced on 18 October 1994 at a rate of Sl.So. 1/- to So.Sh. 100/-. The Somali shilling ceased to be accepted as legal tender in Somaliland on 31 January 1995.

The Somaliland shilling is pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of Sl.Sh. 580/ to US$1. Only the 100/-, 500/-, 1,000/- and 5,000/- banknotes are currently in circulation.

==Coins==
The Somaliland shilling is nominally divided into 100 cents, but coins denominated in cents have never been issued due to their low value. The coin with the lowest value to have been issued is the 1/- coin, first minted in 1994 at the Pobjoy Mint in England and thus bearing the &quot;PM&quot; mint mark. In 2002, 2/- and 5/- coins were issued, bearing depictions of explorer Sir Richard Burton and a cockerel, respectively. Other coins that have been issued are the 10/- coin (depicting a vervet monkey) and 20/- coin (depicting an Italian Greyhound). Somaliland coins are not currently being minted or circulated.

The 1/- and 5/- coins are struck in aluminium, the 10/- coin in brass, the 20/- coin in stainless steel, and the 1,000/- coin in .999 fine silver.

;1/- coin (1994)
This was the first coin issued by the Somaliland government. The coin depicts a Somali pigeon (&quot;Columba oliviae&quot;). The PM (Pobjoy Mint) mint mark is located near the bird&#x27;s tail feathers. The words &quot;&quot; are inscribed on the obverse of the coin; the reverse of the coin bears the words &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; around the &quot;1/-&quot; in the centre.

;5/- coins (2002)
There are two coins in this denomination, both issued in 2002. The first bears a portrait of Sir Richard Francis Burton, the second depicts a rooster.

The specifications of the first coin are as follows:

The obverse of the coin has the words &quot;&quot; inscribed around Burton&#x27;s portrait. The dates &quot;1841 1904&quot; are to the left of the portrait, and &quot;2002&quot; is to the right. &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; are inscribed on the reverse around the &quot;5/-&quot; in the centre.

The specifications of the second coin are as follows:

The obverse of this coin has the words &quot;&quot; inscribed on it and depicts a cockerel. As with the other 5/- coin, the dates &quot;1841 1904&quot; are to the left of the portrait, and &quot;2002&quot; is to the right. &#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;&#x27; are also inscribed on the reverse around the &quot;5/-&quot; in the centre.

;10/- coin (2002)
The Sl.Sh.10/- coin obverse depicts a vervet monkey, around which the words &quot;&quot; are inscribed. The reverse of the coin has &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; inscribed around the &quot;10/-&quot; in the centre.

;20/- coin (2002)
The obverse of the 20/- coin depicts an Italian Greyhound and has the words &quot;&quot; inscribed around it. The reverse has &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; inscribed around the &quot;20/-&quot; in the centre.

==Banknotes==
Banknotes were issued in denominations of 5/-, 10/-, 20/-, 50/-, 100/-, 500/-, 1,000/- and 5,000/-; dates of issue range from 1994 to 2011. Currently, only the 100/-, 500/-, 1,000/- and 5,000/- notes are in circulation.


In 1996 and 1999, regular 50/- notes were reissued in a larger size (130 × 58 or 130 × 57 mm by difference sources).

;5th Anniversary of Independence Commemorative Issue (1996)
In 1996, banknotes were overprinted with the phrase &quot;5th Anniversary of Independence 18 May 1996 Sanad Gurada 5ee Gobanimadda 18 May 1996&quot; in bronze/gold letters, or &quot;Sanad Gurada 5ee Gobanimadda 18 May 1996&quot; in silver letters to commemorate the fifth anniversary of de facto independence. However, it is unclear whether these notes were overprinted by Somaliland authorities or numismatic merchants.

==Exchange rates==
The central bank provides exchange services for various currencies at the official government rate, but most people prefer the unofficial rates used by hawala agents and money changers on the streets of main cities.

*In November 2000, the official exchange rate of Baanka Somaliland was 4,550/- for 1 US dollar. Unofficial exchange rates at the time fluctuated between 4,000/- and 5,000/- per dollar. In December 2008, the official rate had fallen to 7,500/- per US dollar.
*In December 2015, the generally recognized exchange rate was 6,000/- per US dollar, and by July 2019, the generally recognized exchange rate had dropped to 8,500/- per US dollar.
*In December 2022, the official exchange rate of Baanka Somaliland was 8530/- for 1 US dollar. The Somaliland exchange rate in 2019 was 8,500/- per US dollar which is a 0.35% increase of inflation, the Somaliland Shilling remains stable around the 8,000 mark and will most likely decrease in inflation in the coming years.

<doc id="1222681" wikidata="Q1218644" url="?curid=1222681" title="Life of Samuel Johnson">
<text>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791) by James Boswell is a biography of English writer and literary critic Samuel Johnson. The work was from the beginning a universal critical and popular success, and represents a landmark in the development of the modern genre of biography. Many have called it the greatest biography written in English, one of the greatest biographies ever written, and among the greatest nonfiction books of all time. The book is valued as both an important source of information on Johnson and his times, as well as an important and enduring work of literature.

==Background==

On 16 May 1763, as a 22-year-old Scot visiting London, Boswell first met Johnson in the book shop of Johnson&#x27;s friend Tom Davies. They quickly became friends, although for many years they met only when Boswell visited London in the intervals of his law practice in Scotland. From the age of 20, Boswell kept a series of journals thoroughly detailing his day-to-day experience. This journal, when published in the 20th century, filled eighteen volumes, and it was on this large collection of detailed notes that Boswell would base his works on Johnson&#x27;s life. Johnson, in commenting on Boswell&#x27;s excessive note-taking, playfully wrote to Hester Thrale, &quot;One would think the man had been hired to spy upon me&quot;.

On 6 August 1773, eleven years after first meeting Boswell, Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland, to begin &quot;a journey to the western islands of Scotland&quot;, as Johnson&#x27;s 1775 account of their travels would put it. Boswell&#x27;s account, &quot;The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; (1786), published after Johnson&#x27;s death, was a trial of Boswell&#x27;s biographical method before commencing his &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;. With the success of the &quot;Journal&quot;, Boswell started working on the &quot;vast treasure of his conversations at different times&quot; that he recorded in his journals. His goal was to recreate Johnson&#x27;s &quot;life in scenes&quot;. Because Johnson was 53 when Boswell first met him, the last 20 years of Johnson&#x27;s life occupy four fifths of the book. Furthermore, as literary critic Donald Greene has pointed out, Boswell could have spent no more than 250 days with Johnson and, therefore, had to have drawn the rest of the material for the &quot;Life&quot; either from Johnson himself or from secondary sources recounting various incidents.

Before Boswell could publish his &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;, other friends of Johnson&#x27;s published or prepared their own biographies or collections of anecdotes on Johnson: John Hawkins, Thrale, Frances Burney, Anna Seward, Elizabeth Montagu, Hannah More, and Horace Walpole among many. The last edition Boswell worked on was the third, published after his death, in 1799.

==Biography==

There are many biographies and biographers of Samuel Johnson, but James Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; is the best known and most widely read today. Since first publication it has passed through hundreds of editions and, on account of its great length, many selections and abridgements. Yet opinion among 20th-century Johnson scholars such as Edmund Wilson and Donald Greene is that Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; &quot;can hardly be termed a biography at all&quot;, being merely &quot;a collection of those entries in Boswell&#x27;s diaries dealing with the occasions during the last twenty-two years of Johnson&#x27;s life on which they met ... strung together with only a perfunctory effort to fill the gaps&quot;. Furthermore, Greene claims that the work &quot;began with a well-organized press campaign, by Boswell and his friends, of puffing and of denigration of his rivals; and was given a boost by one of Macaulay&#x27;s most memorable pieces of journalistic claptrap&quot;. Instead of being called a &quot;biography&quot;, Greene suggests that the work should be called an &quot;Ana&quot;, a sort of table talk. Boswell&#x27;s original &quot;Life&quot;, moreover, &quot;corrects&quot; many of Johnson&#x27;s quotations, censors many of the more vulgar comments, and largely ignores Johnson&#x27;s early years. 

According to American academician William Dowling, the image of Johnson that Boswell creates features elements of &quot;myth&quot;:
Modern biographers have since corrected Boswell&#x27;s errors. This is not to say that Boswell&#x27;s work is wrong or of no use: scholars such as Walter Jackson Bate appreciate the &quot;detail&quot; and the &quot;treasury of conversation&quot; that it contains. All of Johnson&#x27;s biographers, according to Bate, have to go through the same &quot;igloo&quot; of material that Boswell had to deal with: limited information about Johnson&#x27;s first forty years, and an abundance after. Simply put, &quot;Johnson&#x27;s life continues to hold attention&quot; and &quot;every scrap of evidence relating to Johnson&#x27;s life has continued to be examined and many more details have been added&quot; because &quot;it is so close to general human experience in a wide variety of ways&quot;.

==Critical response==
Edmund Burke told King George III that the work entertained him more than any other. Robert Anderson, in his &quot;Works of the British Poets&quot; (1795), wrote: &quot;With some venial exceptions on the score of egotism and indiscriminate admiration, his work exhibits the most copious, interesting, and finished picture of the life and opinions of an eminent man, that was ever executed; and is justly esteemed one of the most instructive and entertaining books in the English language.&quot;

John Neal praised Boswell&#x27;s style in &quot;The Portico&quot; in 1818. The essay was republished in &quot;Emerson&#x27;s United States Magazine&quot; in 1856. Boswell knew that the charm of Biography is a certain capricious levity that follows all the rambling of conversation; that the Biographer should be utterly forgotten; that the reader should feel acquainted with the man of whom he reads, without remembering a single word that he has read: — but in the execution of these just conceptions, Boswell is continually jogging your elbow, and begging you to forget him; he is incessantly crowding upon your notice. In making you intimately acquainted with his hero, Boswell is not satisfied with telling you, when Samuel Johnson is &quot;not like other men&quot; upon any occasion; but he overwhelms you with his proofs, that he &quot;is&quot; like other men, on occasions when every man, hero or not hero, &quot;must&quot; act like his neighbour. Boswell is not only the Biographer of Johnson in his closet; but he is the biographer of the human species in their most secret retirement.

===19th-century criticism===
Macaulay&#x27;s critique in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; was highly influential and established a way of thinking of Boswell and his &quot;Life of Johnson&quot; which was to prevail for many years. Macaulay was damning of Croker&#x27;s editing: &quot;This edition is ill compiled, ill arranged, ill written, and ill printed&quot;. And the famously ambivalent opinion Macaulay gave of Boswell himself was that the unquestioned excellence of the &quot;Life&quot; was possible only because of traits and habits of Boswell&#x27;s that Macaulay saw as contemptible: &quot;Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London[;] ... such was this man, and such he was content and proud to be&quot;. Macaulay also claimed &quot;Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them&quot;. Macaulay also criticised (as did Lockhart) what he saw as a lack of discretion in the way the &quot;Life&quot; reveals Johnson&#x27;s and others&#x27; personal lives, foibles, habits and private conversation; but contended that it was this that made the &quot;Life of Johnson&quot; a great biography.Without all the qualities which made him the jest and the torment of those among whom he lived, without the officiousness, the inquisitiveness, the effrontery, the toad-eating, the insensitivity to all reproof, he could never have produced so excellent a book. He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson. Macaulay noted that Boswell could give a detailed account only of Johnson&#x27;s later years: &quot;We know him [Johnson], not as he was known to men of his own generation, but as he was known to men whose father he might have been&quot; and that long after Johnson&#x27;s own works had been forgotten, he would be remembered through Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;:... that strange figure which is as familiar to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought up, the gigantic body, the huge massy face, seamed with the scars of disease, the brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the grey wig with the scorched foretop, the dirty hands, the nails bitten and pared to the quick. We see the eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form rolling; we hear it puffing; and then comes the &quot;Why sir!&quot; and &quot;What then, sir?&quot; and the &quot;No, sir!&quot; and the &quot;You don&#x27;t see your way through the question, sir!&quot;

What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable man! To be regarded in his own age as a classic, and in ours as a companion. To receive from his contemporaries that full homage which men of genius have in general received only from posterity! To be more intimately known to posterity than other men are known to their contemporaries! That kind of fame which is commonly the most transient is, in his case, the most durable. The reputation of those writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless table-talk the memory of which, he probably thought, would die with him, are likely to be remembered as long as the English language is spoken in any quarter of the globe ...&quot;Thomas Carlyle wrote two essays in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1832 in review of Croker&#x27;s edition. The first of Carlyle&#x27;s two essays, on &#x27;Biography&#x27;, appeared in issue 27, with the second, &#x27;Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson&#x27;, in issue 28. Carlyle wanted more than facts from histories and biographies: &quot;The thing I want to see is not Redbook Lists and Court Calendars, and Parliamentary Registers, but the LIFE OF MAN in England: what men did, thought, suffered, enjoyed; the form, especially the spirit, of their terrestrial existence, its outward environment, its inward principle; &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot; it was; whence it proceeded, whither it was tending.&quot; Carlyle professed to find this in the &quot;Life&quot;, even in its simplest anecdotes: &quot;Some slight, perhaps mean and even ugly incident if &quot;real&quot; and well presented, will fix itself in a susceptive memory and lie ennobled there&quot;. Consequently, &quot;This Book of Boswell’s will give us more real insight into the &quot;History of England&quot; during those days that twenty other Books, falsely entitled “Histories” which take to themselves that special aim&quot;. &quot;How comes it,&quot; Carlyle asked, &quot;that in England we have simply one good Biography, this &quot;Boswell’s Johnson&quot;?&quot; Carlyle shared Macaulay&#x27;s unfavourable verdict on Croker&#x27;s editorial efforts: &quot;there is simply no edition of Boswell to which this last would seem preferable&quot;. Carlyle did not, however, share Macaulay&#x27;s view of Boswell&#x27;s character. Boswell, though &quot;a foolish, inflated creature, swimming in an element of self-conceit&quot;), had had, said Carlyle, the great good sense to admire and attach himself to Dr Johnson (an attachment which had little to offer materially) and the &quot;open loving heart&quot; which Carlyle thought indispensable for &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;vividly uttering forth&quot;:Boswell wrote a good Book because he had a heart and an eye to discern Wisdom, and an utterance to render it forth; because of his free insight, his lively talent, above all, of his Love and childlike Open-mindedness. His sneaking sycophancies, his greediness and forwardness, whatever was bestial and earthy in him, are so many blemishes in his Book, which still disturb us in its clearness; wholly hindrances, not helps. Towards Johnson, however, his feeling was not Sycophancy, which is the lowest, but Reverence, which is the highest of human feelings.

That loose-flowing, careless-looking Work of his is as a picture by one of Nature&#x27;s own Artists; the best possible resemblance of a Reality; like the very image thereof in a clear mirror. Which indeed it was: let but the mirror be &quot;clear&quot;, this is the great point; the picture must and will be genuine. How the babbling Bozzy, inspired only by love, and the recognition and vision which love can lend, epitomises nightly the words of Wisdom, the deeds and aspects of Wisdom, and so, by little and little, unconsciously works together for us a whole Johnsoniad; a more free, perfect, sunlit and spirit-speaking likeness than for many centuries had been drawn by man of man!

===20th-century reassessment===
More recent critics have been mostly positive. Frederick Pottle calls the &quot;Life&quot; &quot;the crowning achievement of an artist who for more than twenty five years had been deliberately disciplining himself for such a task.&quot; W. K. Wimsatt argues, &quot;the correct response to Boswell is to &quot;value&quot; the man through the artist, the artist in the man&quot;. Leopold Damrosch claims that the work is of those that &quot;do not lend themselves very easily to the usual categories by which the critic explains and justifies his admiration&quot;. Walter Jackson Bate emphasised the uniqueness of the work when he says &quot;nothing comparable to it had existed. Nor has anything comparable been written since, because that special union of talents, opportunities, and subject matter has never been duplicated.&quot;

However, Leopold Damrosch sees problems with Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; if viewed as a conventional biography: &quot;[T]he usual claim that it is the world&#x27;s greatest &quot;biography&quot; seems to me seriously misleading. In the first place, it has real defects of organization and structure; in the second place (and more importantly) it leaves much to be desired as the comprehensive interpretation of a life.&quot; Similarly, although Donald Greene thought that Boswell&#x27;s &quot;The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; a &quot;splendid performance&quot;, he felt that the &quot;Life&quot; was inadequate and Johnson&#x27;s later years deserved a more accurate biography.

==Notable editions==
The first edition of Boswell&#x27;s work appeared on 16 May 1791, in two quarto volumes, with 1,750 copies printed. Once this was exhausted, a second edition in three octavo volumes was published in July 1793. This second edition was augmented by &quot;many valuable additions,&quot; which were appended to the 1791 text; according to Boswell&#x27;s own &quot;Advertisement,&quot; &quot;These have I ordered to be printed separately in quarto, for the accommodation of the purchasers of the first edition.&quot; The third edition, appearing in 1799 after Boswell&#x27;s death, was the responsibility of Edmond Malone, who had been instrumental in the preparation of the previous editions. Malone inserted the additions in the text, adding some bracketed and credited notes by himself and other contributors, including Boswell&#x27;s son James. This third edition has been regarded as definitive by many editors. Malone brought out further editions in 1804, 1807, and 1811.

In 1831, John Wilson Croker produced a new edition which was swiftly condemned in reviews by Thomas Macaulay and Thomas Carlyle. The weakness of Croker&#x27;s notes, criticised by both reviewers, is acknowledged by George Birkbeck Hill: &quot;His remarks and criticisms far too often deserve the contempt that Macaulay so liberally poured on them. Without being deeply versed in books, he was shallow in himself.&quot; More objectionably, Croker interpolated into his Boswell text from the contemporaneous rival biographies of Johnson. Carlyle reviews and denounces the editor&#x27;s procedure as follows:Four Books Mr. C. had by him, wherefrom to gather light for the fifth, which was Boswell&#x27;s. What does he do but now, in the placidest manner,—slit the whole five into slips, and sew these together into a &quot;sextum quid&quot;, exactly at his own convenience; giving Boswell the credit of the whole! By what art-magic, our readers ask, has he united them? By the simplest of all: by Brackets. Never before was the full virtue of the Bracket made manifest. You begin a sentence under Boswell&#x27;s guidance, thinking to be carried happily through it by the same: but no; in the middle, perhaps after your semicolon, and some consequent &#x27;for,&#x27;—starts up one of these Bracket-ligatures, and stitches you in from half a page to twenty or thirty pages of a Hawkins, Tyers, Murphy, Piozzi; so that often one must make the old sad reflection, Where we are, we know; whither we are going, no man knoweth!A new edition by George Birkbeck Hill was published in 1887 and returned to the standard of the third edition text. Hill&#x27;s work in six volumes is copiously annotated, and became standard to such an extent that when in the 20th century, L. F. Powell was commissioned to revise it (1934–64), Hill&#x27;s pagination was retained. The single-volume edition by R. W. Chapman (1953) also remains in print, published by Oxford University Press.

In 1917, Charles Grosvenor Osgood (1871–1964) published an abridged edition, which is available via Project Gutenberg.

<text>Southern Maryland, also referred to as SoMD, is a geographical, cultural and historic region in Maryland composed of the state&#x27;s southernmost counties on the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. According to the state of Maryland, the region includes all of Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary&#x27;s counties and the southern portions of Anne Arundel and Prince George&#x27;s counties. It is largely coterminous with the region of Maryland that is part of the Washington metropolitan area. Portions of the region are also part of the Baltimore Metropolitan Area and the California-Lexington Park Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 Census, the region had a population of 373,177. The largest community in Southern Maryland is Waldorf, with a population of 81,410 as of the 2020 Census.

The first European settlement in Maryland was established in Southern Maryland at St. Mary&#x27;s City in 1634. This settlement is considered by historians to be the birthplace of religious freedom in North America. Throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the area developed an agricultural slave economy, with agriculture maintaining prominence following emancipation. Many historical events occurred in Southern Maryland during the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War. Much of the area remains rural, however the region saw suburban growth in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as Washington&#x27;s suburbs expanded southward.

In 2023, the region was designated as the Southern Maryland National Heritage Area.

== Geography ==

Counties located in Southern Maryland include Calvert County, Charles County, St. Mary&#x27;s County, and the southern portions of Prince George&#x27;s County and Anne Arundel County.
The region&#x27;s northern boundary passes through Prince George&#x27;s County and Anne Arundel County, east of Washington. Its eastern boundary is the Chesapeake Bay and its southern and western boundary is the Potomac River, Maryland&#x27;s boundary with Virginia (and through it, the Northern Neck).

The Patuxent River runs through Southern Maryland, separating Calvert County and Anne Arundel County from Charles County, Prince George&#x27;s County and St. Mary&#x27;s County.

Land features in Southern Maryland include the St. Mary&#x27;s Peninsula and the Calvert Peninsula.

Geologic formations of the Chesapeake Group can be found in Southern Maryland, including the Calvert Formation, the St. Marys Formation, and the Choptank Formation. Many of these formations are present at the Calvert Cliffs State Park in Calvert County.

Southern Maryland is within the Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic region.

== History ==

===Colonial Era===

Southern Maryland was originally inhabited by the indigenous Piscataway people. English explorer Captain John Smith explored the area in 1608 and 1609.

Cecilius Calvert was granted a charter to establish a colony meant to be a safe-haven for Catholics in 1632. Expeditions were launched into modern day Maryland, with an expedition reaching St. Clement&#x27;s Island in 1634. Later that year, the Maryland Colony was established by Leonard Calvert, first Governor of Maryland and brother of Cecilius. The colony&#x27;s capital, and first settlement, was the newly established St. Mary&#x27;s City.
The colony originally focused on tobacco farming and was very successful although disease was a problem and many settlers died until immunities built up in the population. Religious tensions and also periods of open conflict also continued to be a major challenge.

St. Mary&#x27;s City is widely considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in North America. The colony there started under a mandate of religious tolerance in a time when England was anything but religiously tolerant. This was due to the colony&#x27;s charter, which did not prohibit non-protestant churches. In 1649, the Maryland Colonial Assembly passed of one of the earliest laws requiring religious tolerance, known as the Maryland Toleration Act of 1649.

After 61 years as Maryland&#x27;s capital an uprising of Protestants put an end to religious tolerance, overthrowing the old Catholic leadership and putting an end to colonial St. Mary&#x27;s City itself, moving the colonial capital to Annapolis.

===Plantation economy and slavery===
St. Mary&#x27;s City was abandoned as a capital but was slowly consolidated from smaller farms into a large, single slave plantation by the late 1600s. Originally, laborers were Indentured Servants, with African slaves arriving in 1639. Tobacco and (later) also wheat plantations expanded there and in Southern Maryland as a whole during the slavery era. The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade brought African slaves by the boatloads, with 100,000 slaves disembarking in Maryland during the century before the American Revolution. From the late 1600s to early 1700s, about half of Maryland&#x27;s enslaved population lived in Calvert, St Mary&#x27;s, Prince George&#x27;s, and Charles counties. By 1755, one third of Maryland&#x27;s population were enslaved Africans. Slavery proved vital to Maryland&#x27;s economy, with the institution providing the foundation for Maryland&#x27;s economy and society. The profits from slavery also provided the means for Maryland&#x27;s gentry to gain power and dominate politics.

272 slaves from across Maryland, including the Southern Maryland counties of Charles, St. Mary&#x27;s, and Prince George&#x27;s, were sold during the 1838 Jesuit slave sale to two planters in Louisiana.

A notable abolitionist from southern Maryland was Josiah Henson, a slave who was born in Charles County before escaping to Canada. Henson wrote an autobiography that inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel, Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin. Slavery ended in Maryland in November 1864 during the American Civil War, when Maryland ratified a new Constitution that abolished slavery.

===The American Revolution and the War of 1812===
During the American Revolutionary War, British forces landed on St. George Island in St. Mary&#x27;s County on July 15, 1776, under the command of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore. Dunmore&#x27;s forces were defeated by local Flying Camp militia led by Captain Rezin Beall, and they left the island on August 9, 1776. During the war, American slaves throughout the Chesapeake region flocked to British lines following Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation, which promised freedom for slaves who fought for the British military.

Due to Southern Maryland&#x27;s proximity to the national capitol, the region was deeply affected by the War of 1812, with the war severely disrupting the lives of the region&#x27;s citizens. During August and September 1814, the British launched a campaign in the Chesapeake region. British forces landed in Benedict, Charles County on August 19, 1814. Intent on marching to Washington, the British marched to Upper Marlboro before engaging American troops at the Battle of Bladensburg. The battle resulted in a British victory. By nightfall on August 24, 1814, British forces entered Washington and burned several government buildings. The British then marched back to Benedict. Similarly to what occurred in the Revolutionary War, enslaved Marylanders fled to British controlled areas to receive freedom.

===American Civil War===

During the American Civil War, wartime sympathies were divided in Maryland and Southern Maryland was sympathetic to the Confederates next to Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore. From the war&#x27;s beginning, however, large numbers of Union occupying troops and patrolling river gunboats prevented the state&#x27;s secession, although frequent nighttime smuggling across the Potomac River with Virginia took place, including of Maryland men volunteering for Confederate service. John Wilkes Booth was helped by several people in his escape through the area and in crossing the river after killing President Abraham Lincoln. Thousands of captured Confederate troops were confined in harsh conditions at Point Lookout Prison Camp at the southern tip of the peninsula. During the war, in November 1863, Maryland ratified a new state Constitution which abolished slavery in the state.

===Transition to modern era===
Southern Maryland was traditionally a rural, agricultural, oyster fishing and crabbing region; linked by passenger and freight steamboat routes. These steamboat routes operated on the Chesapeake Bay and major rivers until the 1930s before the building of highways and the Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge on U.S. Highway 301. (The latter highway was named after Robert Crain, an attorney who owned the state&#x27;s largest farm, Mount Victoria, and who campaigned for the road&#x27;s construction). Weekend excursion boats also carried Washingtonians to small amusement parks and amusement pavilions at numerous Potomac shore locations. From 1949 (1943 in some places) to 1968, the region was known for its poverty and its slot machine gambling.

=== Modernizing St. Mary&#x27;s County ===

Poverty was common in St. Mary&#x27;s County in the 1960s, and gambling in the region came to be seen as a blight and was outlawed by Governor J. Millard Tawes and the state legislature. A local political figure, St. Mary&#x27;s County politician J. Frank Raley Jr. organized a slate of local candidates with the platform of challenging the political status-quo and lifting the region out of its generations long poverty.

The region&#x27;s isolation was ended by having a series of bridges built and roads expanded into highways. These developments are credited for enabling the development of modern St. Mary&#x27;s County.

Raley was falsely accused of working to end gambling outright in the region, which ended in his defeat and his official political career. In fact he had supported a referendum on gambling which would have put the decision directly in the hands of voters. He continued nevertheless lobbying on behalf of the Southern Maryland region and sitting on development boards and continued to have a major influence on economic development in the region for the rest of his life.

==Population and economy==

Since the 1980s, the region experienced suburban development as the Washington suburbs expanded southward. This expansion took place primarily in Prince George&#x27;s County, and around Waldorf (a regional shopping hub) and St. Charles (a planned community in Charles County), Lexington Park (St. Mary&#x27;s County) and Prince Frederick (Calvert County). Much of the area remains rural, a mixture of forest and farmland, despite suburban growth. This suburban growth has occurred and continued despite concerns from locals and environmental advocates.

Many southern Marylanders work for the United States Armed Forces or the United States Federal Government and its related industries. Other smaller industries include a nuclear power plant and a liquified natural gas terminal (both in Lusby), a Naval ordnance test ground (at Indian Head), electric power plants (at Aquasco and Morgantown) and an oil terminal (at Piney Point). The towns of Solomons Island and Chesapeake Beach are tourist resorts. The Maryland International Raceway and Budds Creek Raceway near Chaptico attract many auto and motocross racing enthusiasts.

===Military bases===

Military installations in Southern Maryland include:

* Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Lexington Park, St. Mary&#x27;s County, home of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and place where the F-35 fighter aircraft was developed.
* Joint Base Andrews and Andrews Air Force Base, Camp Springs, in southern Prince Georges County, home of Air Force One and Marine One, aircraft for the President of the United States.
* Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, Charles County, national munitions research and development center
* Webster Field, St. Inigoes, St. Mary&#x27;s County, aircraft research and development, training field for test pilots
* Brandywine Receiver Site in Brandywine, Maryland. It is a remote facility associated with Andrews Air Force Base, and is remotely maintained from the Davidsonville Transmitter Site in Davidsonville, Maryland.
* Coast Guard Station St. Inigoes, St. Mary&#x27;s County; public safety and rescue, law enforcement and fisheries enforcement for area waters

Suburban areas of Southern Maryland also have many Washington-area military related commuters.

=== Tourism ===

The Southern Maryland National Heritage Area was established in the National Heritage Area Act in 2022. The National Heritage Area helps preserve and promote destinations in four counties. The National Heritage Area was officially designated in 2023.

It is also one of thirteen state heritage areas and is administered by the Maryland Historical Trust through the Maryland Heritage Areas Program.

Tourist Attractions in Southern Maryland include historical sites, such as the Thomas Stone National Historic Site, Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City, and Port Tobacco Village, among others. Museums in the area include the Calvert Marine Museum, and the Patuxent River Naval Air Museum. Waterfront sites along the Chesapeake Bay, the Potomac River, and the Patuxent River are also tourist attractions. These include Mallows Bay, the Mallows Bay–Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary, and Solomon&#x27;s Island.

== Politics ==
The entire region is contained within Maryland&#x27;s 5th congressional district, which has been represented by Rep. Steny Hoyer since 1981.

Maryland&#x27;s two U.S. senators are Chris van Hollen (senior) and Angela Alsobrooks (junior).

== Food and cuisine ==
Oysters are still widely available although they were once fished from the bay and its tidal tributaries in greater numbers, and are served either fried, raw, or stuffed. &quot;Rockfish&quot;, the Maryland word for striped bass, is considered the most prized fish dish in Southern Maryland.

Perhaps the most notable food dish originating from Southern Maryland is stuffed ham, which includes cabbage, kale, onions, spices and seasonings that are chopped and mixed, then stuffed into deep slits slashed in a whole, corned ham.

== Sports ==
Many residents also identify with national sports teams in Washington DC or Baltimore.

== Colleges ==

Colleges in Southern Maryland include:
* The College of Southern Maryland, a two-year community college with campuses in Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary&#x27;s Counties
* St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, a four-year public honors college in St. Mary&#x27;s County with some graduate school offerings

<doc id="1222689" wikidata="Q36710" url="?curid=1222689" title="Qualitative inorganic analysis">
<text>Classical qualitative inorganic analysis is a method of analytical chemistry which seeks to find the elemental composition of inorganic compounds. It is mainly focused on detecting ions in an aqueous solution, therefore materials in other forms may need to be brought to this state before using standard methods. The solution is then treated with various reagents to test for reactions characteristic of certain ions, which may cause color change, precipitation and other visible changes.

Qualitative inorganic analysis is that branch or method of analytical chemistry which seeks to establish the elemental composition of inorganic compounds through various reagents.

==Physical appearance of some inorganic compounds==
== Detecting cations ==
According to their properties, cations are usually classified into six groups. Each group has a common reagent which can be used to separate them from the solution. To obtain meaningful results, the separation must be done in the sequence specified below, as some ions of an earlier group may also react with the reagent of a later group, causing ambiguity as to which ions are present. This happens because cationic analysis is based on the solubility products of the ions. As the cation gains its optimum concentration needed for precipitation it precipitates and hence allowing us to detect it. The division and precise details of separating into groups vary slightly from one source to another; given below is one of the commonly used schemes.

=== 1st analytical group of cations ===
The &quot;1st analytical group of cations&quot; consists of ions which form insoluble chlorides. As such, the group reagent to separate them is hydrochloric acid, usually used at a concentration of 1–2 M. Concentrated HCl must not be used, because it forms a soluble complex ([PbCl4]2−) with Pb2+. Consequently, the Pb2+ ion would go undetected.

The most important cations in the 1st group are Ag+, Hg, and Pb2+. The chlorides of these elements cannot be distinguished from each other by their colour - they are all white solid compounds. PbCl2 is soluble in hot water, and can therefore be differentiated easily. Ammonia is used as a reagent to distinguish between the other two. While AgCl dissolves in ammonia (due to the formation of the complex ion [Ag(NH3)2]+), Hg2Cl2 gives a black precipitate consisting of a mixture of chloro-mercuric amide and elemental mercury. Furthermore, AgCl is reduced to silver under light, which gives samples a violet colour.

The silver ammonia complex can react with bismuth ions and iodide to generate orange or brown Ag2BiI5 precipitate.

PbCl2 is far more soluble than the chlorides of the other two ions, especially in hot water. Therefore, HCl in concentrations which completely precipitate Hg and Ag+ may not be sufficient to do the same to Pb2+. Higher concentrations of Cl− cannot be used for the before mentioned reasons. Thus, a filtrate obtained after first group analysis of Pb2+ contains an appreciable concentration of this cation, enough to give the test of the second group, viz. formation of an insoluble sulfide. For this reason, Pb2+ is usually also included in the 2nd analytical group.

A signature reaction of lead ions involve the formation of a yellow lead chromate precipitate upon treatment with chromate ions. This precipitate doesn&#x27;t dissolve in ammonia (unlike Cu(II) and Ag(I)) or acetic acid (unlike Cu(II) and Hg(II)).

This group can be determined by adding the salt in water and then adding dilute hydrochloric acid. A white precipitate is formed, to which ammonia is then added. If the precipitate is insoluble, then Pb2+ is present; if the precipitate is soluble, then Ag+ is present, and if the white precipitate turns black, then Hg is present.

Hg ions, after oxidation in the presence of chloride ions to HgCl42-, can form a characteristic orange-red precipitate of Cu2HgI4 with the addition of Cu2+ and I−.

Confirmation test for Pb2+: 
:Pb2+ + 2 KI → PbI2 + 2 K+
:Pb2+ + K2CrO4 → PbCrO4 + 2 K+

Confirmation test for Ag+:
:Ag+ + KI → AgI + K+
:2Ag+ + K2CrO4 → Ag2CrO4 + 2 K+

Confirmation test for Hg:
:Hg + 2 KI → Hg2I2 + 2 K+
:2 Hg + 2 NaOH → 2 HgO + 2 Na+ + H2O

=== 2nd analytical group of cations ===

The &quot;2nd analytical group of cations&quot; consists of ions which form acid-insoluble sulfides. Cations in the 2nd group include: Cd2+, Bi3+, Cu2+, As3+, As5+, Sb3+, Sb5+, Sn2+, Sn4+ and Hg2+. Pb2+ is usually also included here in addition to the first group. Although these methods refer to solutions that contain sulfide (S2−), these solutions actually only contain H2S and bisulfide (HS−). Sulfide (S2−) does not exist in appreciable concentrations in water.

The reagent used can be any substance that gives S2− ions in such solutions; most commonly used are hydrogen sulfide (at 0.2-0.3 M), thioacetamide (at 0.3-0.6 M), addition of hydrogen sulfide can often prove to be a lumbersome process and therefore sodium sulfide can also serve the purpose. The test with the sulfide ion must be conducted in the presence of dilute HCl. Its purpose is to keep the sulfide ion concentration at a required minimum, so as to allow the precipitation of 2nd group cations alone. If dilute acid is not used, the early precipitation of 4th group cations (if present in solution) may occur, thus leading to misleading results. Acids beside HCl are rarely used. Sulfuric acid may lead to the precipitation of the 5th group cations, whereas nitric acid oxidises the sulfide ion in the reagent, forming colloidal sulfur.

The precipitates of these cations are almost indistinguishable, except for CdS, which is yellow. All the precipitates, except for HgS, are soluble in dilute nitric acid. HgS is soluble only in aqua regia, which can be used to separate it from the rest. The action of ammonia is also useful in differentiating the cations. CuS dissolves in ammonia forming an intense blue solution, whereas CdS dissolves forming a colourless solution. The sulfides of As3+, As5+, Sb3+, Sb5+, Sn2+, Sn4+ are soluble in yellow ammonium sulfide, where they form polysulfide complexes.

This group is determined by adding the salt in water and then adding dilute hydrochloric acid (to make the medium acidic) followed by hydrogen sulfide gas. Usually it is done by passing hydrogen sulfide over the test tube for detection of 1st group cations. If it forms a reddish-brown or black precipitate then Bi3+, Cu2+, Hg2+ or Pb2+ is present. Otherwise, if it forms a yellow precipitate, then Cd2+ or Sn4+ is present; or if it forms a brown precipitate, then Sn2+ must be present; or if a red orange precipitate is formed, then Sb3+ is present.

:Pb2+ + K2CrO4 → PbCrO4 + 2 K+

Confirmation test for copper:

:2 Cu2+ + K4[Fe(CN)6] + CH3COOH → Cu2[Fe(CN)6] + 4 K+
:Cu2+ + 2 NaOH → Cu(OH)2 + 2 Na+
:Cu(OH)2 → CuO + H2O (endothermic)
:(Another very sensitive test for copper utilizes the fact that Cu2+ can serve as a catalyst for the oxidation of thiosulfate ions by Fe3+ ions. In the absence of Cu2+, Fe3+ can form the purple complex Fe(S2O3)2− without undergoing redox. If the added sample contains Cu2+, the solution will rapidly discolor.)

Confirmation test for bismuth:

:Bi3+ + 3 KI (in excess) → BiI3 + 3 K+
:BiI3 + KI → K[BiI4]
:Bi3+ + H2O (in excess) → BiO + 2 H+
:(Bismuth ions can form th bright yellow complex Bi(tu)33+ in the presence of thiourea under acidic conditions, which can be precipitated as the orange-red Bi(tu)3I3•Cu(tu)3I in the presence of Cu2+ and I−, and this can also act as a test for bismuth.)

Confirmation test for mercury:

:Hg2+ + 2 KI (in excess) → HgI2 + 2 K+
:HgI2 + 2 KI → K2[HgI4] (red precipitate dissolves)
:2 Hg2+ + SnCl2 → 2 Hg + SnCl4 (white precipitate turns gray)
:(Hg2+ may otherwise be detected via Cu2HgI4 formation, see Hg22+ in 1st group cations.)

=== 3rd analytical group of cations ===
The &quot;3rd analytical group of cations&quot; includes ions which form hydroxides that are insoluble even at low concentrations.

Cations in the 3rd group are, among others: Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Cr3+.

The group is determined by making a solution of the salt in water and adding ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium chloride is added to ensure low concentration of hydroxide ions.

The formation of a reddish-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+; a gelatinous white precipitate indicates Al3+; and a green precipitate indicates Cr3+ or Fe2+. These last two are distinguished by adding sodium hydroxide in excess to the green precipitate. If the precipitate dissolves, Cr3+ is indicated; otherwise, Fe2+ is present.

=== 4th analytical group of cations ===
The 4th analytical group of cations includes ions that precipitate as sulfides at pH 9. The reagent used is ammonium sulfide or Na2S 0.1 M added to the ammonia/ammonium chloride solution used to detect group 3 cations. 
It includes: Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. Zinc will form a white precipitate, nickel and cobalt a black precipitate and manganese a brick/flesh colored precipitate. Dimethylglyoxime can be used to confirm nickel presence, while ammonium thiocyanate in ether will turn blue in the presence of cobalt. This group is sometimes denoted as IIIB since groups III and IV are tested for at the same time, with the addition of sulfide being the only difference.

This includes ions which form sulfides that are insoluble at high concentrations. The reagents used are H2S in the presence of NH4OH. NH4OH is used to increase the concentration of the sulfide ion, by the common ion effect - hydroxide ions from NH4OH combine with H+ ions from H2S, which shifts the equilibrium in favor of the ionized form:

: 2 + 


They contain Zn2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ and Co2+

=== 5th analytical group of cations ===
Ions in 5th analytical group of cations form carbonates that are insoluble in water. The reagent usually used is (NH4)2CO3 (at around 0.2 M), with a neutral or slightly basic pH. All the cations in the previous groups are separated beforehand, since many of them also form insoluble carbonates.

The most important ions in the 5th group are Ba2+, Ca2+, and Sr2+. After separation, the easiest way to distinguish between these ions is by testing flame colour: barium gives a yellow-green flame, calcium gives brick red, and strontium, crimson red.

=== 6th analytical group of cations ===
Cations which are left after carefully separating previous groups are considered to be in the sixth analytical group. The most important ones are Mg2+, Li+, Na+ and K+. All the ions are distinguished by flame color: lithium gives a red flame, sodium gives bright yellow (even in trace amounts), potassium gives violet, and magnesium, colorless (although magnesium metal burns with a bright white flame). Magnesium can also be distinguished from other cations in this group by adding sodium hydroxide to drive the pH to 11 or higher, which selectively precipitates Mg(OH)2.

==Detecting anions==

=== 1st analytical group of anions ===
The &quot;1st group of anions&quot; consist of CO, HCO, CH3COO−, S2−, SO,  and NO. The reagent for Group 1 anions is dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) or dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4).

* Carbonates give a brisk effervescence with dilute H2SO4 due to the release of CO2, a colorless gas which turns limewater milky due to formation of CaCO3 (carbonatation). The milkiness disappears on passing an excess of the gas through the lime water, due to formation of Ca(HCO3)2.
* Acetates give the vinegar-like smell of CH3COOH when treated with dilute H2SO4 and heated. A blood red colouration is produced upon addition of yellow FeCl3, due to formation of iron(III) acetate.
* Sulfides give the rotten egg smell of H2S when treated with dilute H2SO4. The presence of sulfide is confirmed by adding lead(II) acetate paper, which turns black due to the formation of PbS. Sulfides also turn solutions of red sodium nitroprusside purple.
* Sulfites produce SO2 gas, which smells of burning sulfur, when treated with dilute acid. They turn acidified K2Cr2O7 from orange to green.
* Thiosulfates produce SO2 gas when treated with dilute acid. In addition, they form a cloudy precipitate of sulfur.
* Nitrites give reddish-brown fumes of NO2 when treated with dilute H2SO4. These fumes cause a solution of potassium iodide (KI) and starch to turn blue.

=== 2nd analytical group of anions ===
The &quot;2nd group of anions&quot; consist of Cl−, Br−, I−, NO and CO. The group reagent for Group 2 anion is concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).

After addition of the acid, chlorides, bromides and iodides will form precipitates with silver nitrate. The precipitates are white, pale yellow, and yellow, respectively. The silver halides formed are completely soluble, partially soluble, or not soluble at all, respectively, in aqueous ammonia solution.

Chlorides are confirmed by the &quot;chromyl chloride test&quot;. When the salt is heated with K2Cr2O7 and concentrated H2SO4, red vapours of chromyl chloride (CrO2Cl2) are produced. Passing this gas through a solution of NaOH produces a yellow solution of Na2CrO4. The acidified solution of Na2CrO4 gives a yellow precipitate with the addition of (CH3COO)2Pb.

Bromides and iodides are confirmed by the &quot;layer test&quot;. A sodium carbonate extract is made from the solution containing bromide or iodide, and CHCl3 or  is added to the solution, which separates into two layers: an orange colour in the or layer indicates the presence of Br−, and a violet colour indicates the presence of I−.

Nitrates give brown fumes with concentrated H2SO4 due to formation of NO2. This is intensified upon adding copper turnings. Nitrate ion is confirmed by adding an aqueous solution of the salt to FeSO4 and pouring concentrated H2SO4 slowly along the sides of the test tube, which produces a brown ring around the walls of the tube, at the junction of the two liquids caused by the formation of .

Upon treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid, oxalates yield colourless CO2 and CO gases. These gases burn with a bluish flame and turn lime water milky. Oxalates also decolourise KMnO4 and give a white precipitate with CaCl2.

=== 3rd analytical group of anions ===
The &quot;3rd group of anions&quot; consist of SO, PO and BO. They react neither with concentrated nor diluted H2SO4.

* Sulfates give a white precipitate of BaSO4 with BaCl2 which is insoluble in any acid or base.
* Phosphates give a yellow crystalline precipitate upon addition of HNO3 and ammonium molybdate and heating the solution.
* Borates give a green flame characteristic of ethyl borate when ignited with concentrated H2SO4 and ethanol.

==Modern techniques==
Qualitative inorganic analysis is now used only as a pedagogical tool. Modern techniques such as atomic absorption spectroscopy and ICP-MS are able to quickly detect the presence and concentrations of elements using a very small amount of sample.

==Sodium carbonate test==

The sodium carbonate test (not to be confused with sodium carbonate extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. The compounds formed are, respectively, basic copper carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium. See qualitative inorganic analysis for the complete sequence of tests used for qualitative cation analysis.

<text>The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) () is a statutory independent research institute in Ireland. It was established in 1940 on the initiative of the Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, in Dublin.

The institute consists of three schools: the School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic Studies. The directors of these schools are, as of 2023, Professor Denjoe O&#x27;Connor, Professor Tom Ray and Professor Ruairí Ó hUiginn. The institute, under its governing act, is empowered to &quot;train students in methods of advanced research&quot; but does not itself award degrees; graduate students working under the supervision of Institute researchers can, with the agreement of the governing board of the appropriate school, be registered for a higher degree in any university worldwide.

Following a comprehensive review of the higher education sector and its institutions, conducted by the Higher Education Authority for the Minister for Education and Skills in 2013, DIAS was approved to remain an independent institute carrying out fundamental research. It appointed a new CEO, Dr Eucharia Meehan, formerly director of the Irish Research Council, in the summer of 2017.

==History==
===Context===
After becoming Taoiseach in 1937, Éamon de Valera investigated the possibility of setting up an institute of higher learning. De Valera was aware of the decline of the Dunsink Observatory, where Sir William Rowan Hamilton and others had held the position of Royal Astronomer of Ireland. Following meetings with prominent academics in the fields of mathematics and astronomy, he came to the conclusion that astronomy at Dunsink should be revived and an institute for higher learning should be established. The institute was and is modeled on the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, which was founded in 1930, and theoretical physics was still the research subject in 1940. The School of Celtic Studies owes its founding to the importance de Valera accorded to the Irish language. He considered it a vital element in the makeup of the nation, and therefore important that the nation should have a place of higher learning devoted to this subject.

DIAS was founded on the direction of the Taoiseach, under the &quot;Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940&quot; As set out in its legislation, &#x27;the functions of the Institute shall be to provide facilities for the furtherance of advanced study and the conduct of research in specialised branches of knowledge and for the publication of results of advanced study and research.&#x27;

===Early phase===
The institute was initially located at 64 and 65 Merrion Square and had two schools - the School of Theoretical Physics and the School of Celtic Studies - to which the School of Cosmic Physics was added in 1947. Currently, the institute has its schools located at three premises on the Southside of Dublin at 10 Burlington Road, 31 Fitzwilliam Place and 5 Merrion Square. It also maintains a presence at Dunsink Observatory in north County Dublin.

Work by the Geophysics section of the School of Cosmic Physics on the formation of the North Atlantic demonstrated that the Irish continental shelf extended much further than previously thought, thereby more than doubling the area of the seabed over which Ireland can claim economic exploitation rights under the international law of the sea. In addition to geophysical research, the Geophysics Section maintains the Irish National Seismic Network (INSN). Fundamental work in statistical mechanics by the School of Theoretical Physics has found application in computer switching technology and led to the establishment of an Irish campus company to exploit this intellectual property. The institute has also in recent years been one of the main agents helping to set up a modern e-Infrastructure in support of all Irish research.

In 1968 the Royal Society recognised de Valera&#x27;s contribution to science in establishing the institute by electing him to honorary fellowship.

===21st century===
====Impact of the financial crisis====
In July 2009 the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (also known as the McCarthy report) suggested, as part of a long list of proposals, that the institute be amalgamated into either University College Dublin or Trinity College Dublin. The Report noted 79 staff members being paid €6.7m by the Exchequer, an average of nearly €85,000 per person p.a. However, the audited accounts contained in the annual report for 2009
show that the exchequer pay grant included a figure of just over €1m on pensions as well as smaller sums for visitors and that the actual Salaries and Wages figure was €5.1m bringing the average down to €65k.

Subsequently, in the comprehensive review of the higher education sector, and its institutions, conducted by the Higher Education Authority in 2013, it was proposed that &#x27;In the case of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies... no structural change be made to this statutory, independent research institute carrying out fundamental research in three schools, Celtic Studies, Cosmic Physics and Theoretical Physics. However, responsibility for allocation of funding to the institute will be transferred from the Department of Education and Skills to the Higher Education Authority. The Minister for Education and Skills accepted this proposal as part of the broader reconfiguration of the higher education system.&#x27; , DIAS remains an independent body reporting to the Department of Education and Skills.

==Current status and staffing==
In 2022 the institute had 115 team members, 96 of whom were directly engaged in advanced studies/research and 19 in general administration/support and non-research roles. 59% of early stage career researchers were funded by external competitively sourced funding. DIAS researchers in 2022 hailed from 24 countries across the world.

==Schools and academic work==
===School of Celtic Studies===
====History====
The School of Celtic Studies () was created in 1940 as one of the two founding Schools of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. Its first director was Osborn Bergin. Other major scholars who have worked at the School in the past include T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly, Daniel Binchy, Cecile O&#x27;Rahilly, R. I. Best, James Carney, Myles Dillon, Proinsias Mac Cana, David Greene, Brian Ó Cuív, Breandán Ó Buachalla, Roparz Hemon and Heinrich Wagner.

The current director of the School is Ruairí Ó hUiginn. The School is located at 10 Burlington Road in Dublin 4.

====Research====
The School has a wide remit embracing all of the Celtic languages and all periods. The bulk of its research has been on the history of the Irish language and its literature from the earliest times onwards. Among the School&#x27;s core duties are: the cataloguing of Irish manuscripts; the publishing of Irish texts from the manuscripts; the study of the grammar and development of Irish over time; the recording and study of spoken Irish dialects; the contribution of literature in Irish to the history of Irish society (for example, the early Irish law tracts); and similar research within the other Celtic languages.

The School of Celtic Studies runs the Irish Script on Screen Project (ISOS), which makes available digital images of Irish manuscripts from libraries around the world. The ‘Ogham in 3D Project’ aims to capture and catalogue 3D-digital images of all early medieval inscriptions in the ogham alphabet. The School maintains an electronic Bibliography of Irish Linguistics and Literature. Its website also hosts the independent projects, Monasticon Hibernicum and the Bardic Poetry Database.

The School also acts as a publishing house for Celtic Studies. It has its own journal, Celtica, which was founded in 1946 and publishes research in all areas of Celtic Studies. Celtica has traditionally appeared at irregular intervals, but from 2016 has become an annual publication appearing every November. The Library of the School is open to academics and advanced students on application.

There is a three-yearly summer school which offers courses in Old Irish, Early Modern Irish and Middle Welsh. The School also hosts occasional day conferences, and an annual conference known as Tionól (&quot;gathering&quot;) which takes place in November. The School offers O’Donovan Scholarships to researchers. These are tenable for three years, and there are usually four at any one time. The Bergin Fellowship is offered to slightly more senior researchers, and lasts for five years.

===School of Theoretical Physics===

====History====

The School of theoretical Physics initially consisted of just one member, Professor Erwin Schrödinger, who moved into 65 Merrion Square in February 1941. Schrödinger began his duties as director of the school by giving two courses on quantum theory. Up to this time there had not been courses of this level available in Ireland. The lecture series were at two levels, the lower level including introductory wave mechanics, perturbation theory of quantum mechanical systems, spin of the electron and Dirac&#x27;s relativistic wave equation. The higher level provided an introduction to the research being performed at the school. In June 1941 Schrödinger was joined by Walter Heitler who took the position of assistant professor. Heitler gave a course of lectures designed to introduce students to quantum theory of the chemical bond. These lectures brought together staff and students of third-level establishments in the Dublin area, exposing them to twentieth-century theoretical physics. Members of the mathematical community at the time seized the opportunity to hear the lectures of Schrödinger and Heitler and within a few years the material covered began to find its way onto undergraduate university courses.

One of the objectives de Valera had in mind when he founded the institute was to provide a meeting place for scholars from University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin. For reasons both historical and religious, the academic contacts between the two institutions had previously been non-existent. (A quarter of a century later, a proposed conjoining of the two institutions, put forward by Donogh O&#x27;Malley in the abortive Universities Mergers Bill 1967 was strongly opposed by both universities and was ultimately defeated.)

====Research====

In its early years the research of the school mainly focused on non-linear field theory, meson theory, general relativity and geometry. Mesons which Heitler began researching when he arrived in 1941 were at the time believed to be the fundamental particles of the strong interaction. In 1948 John Lighton Synge was appointed senior professor, whose research interests were general relativity and geometry. Later research involved numerical analysis due to the addition of Cornelius Lanczos to the faculty and the development of the computer. Lochlainn O&#x27;Raifeartaigh made contributions in the application of symmetries in theoretical particle physics and John T. Lewis had interests including Bose–Einstein condensation and Large deviations theory.

The school has three senior professors at present: Tony Dorlas, Denjoe O&#x27;Connor and Sergei Gukov. Dorlas has worked on a lattice model of a boson gas called the Bose–Hubbard model, on models of a spin glass and on Anderson localisation in quasi-one-dimensional systems, and also on quantum information theory. O&#x27;Connor has worked on noncommutative geometry and applications to quantum field theory, especially as an alternative to lattice field theory, and on crossover phenomena and the renormalisation group.

===School of Cosmic Physics===
====History====
The School of Cosmic Physics was added to DIAS in 1947, partially at the prompting of Walter Heitler in the School of Theoretical Physics who wanted to have contact with experimental cosmic ray studies for his work on meson physics. It was also partially in response to a proposal prepared by Leo Wenzel Pollak then working for the Irish Meteorological Service in Foynes, who argued the need for a geophysical research centre in Ireland. It was also established to fulfil Éamon de Valera&#x27;s ambition to save Dunsink Observatory and its scientific heritage. The new school had three main areas of research; astronomy based in Dunsink Observatory, and geophysics and cosmic ray studies based in 5 Merrion Square. The Chair of the School of Cosmic Physics from 1970 to 1995 was Edward F. Fahy.

The first Head of Astronomy was Hermann Brück, who established a program of solar near-UV spectroscopy and photo-electric stellar photometry. Geophysics was headed by Leo Wenzel Pollak who worked mainly on atmospheric aerosol physics in close collaboration with the Nolan brothers in UCD. Attempts were made to persuade the Austrian Nobel laureate Victor Francis Hess to come to Dublin as first head of the Cosmic Ray section, but in the end, he declined and the position was offered to a Hungarian physicist, Lajos Janossy, who came from Patrick Blackett&#x27;s laboratory in Manchester and worked on what would now be called air shower physics.

The School was central to what was the first inter-governmental agreement between the two parts of Ireland, and the first international agreement to operate a shared observing facility in the southern hemisphere, when it entered into the Armagh-Dunsink-Harvard agreement (signed in 1947) to operate a large Schmidt telescope at the Boyden Observatory in South Africa. The School was also involved with the first Irish experiments to fly on space missions as cosmic ray experiments, in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley were flown to the moon on the Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 missions. The School pioneered, in collaboration with the University of Hamburg, a seismic study of the North Atlantic resulting in the discovery that the Irish continental shelf extended much further out than previously thought with potentially very significant economic benefits for Ireland.

More recently the School has, with funding from the PRTLI programme cycles 3 and 4, invested in a shared national research e-infrastructure culminating in the establishment of the Irish Centre for High-End Computing ICHEC.

In November 2009, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin, TD, agreed to the establishment of The National Data Centre (NDC) for the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) within the Geophysics Section of DIAS. It was officially opened on Friday 22 June 2012. The NDC receives data from the seismic stations that support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).

====Research====
Over the years the various sections of the School of Cosmic Physics have changed their research areas in response to changes in the interests of senior staff as well as the changing external environment. The cosmic ray section eventually evolved into a theoretical astrophysics section with a strong emphasis on high-energy, non-thermal phenomena as well as star formation and was combined with the astronomy section into a single astronomy and astrophysics Section. The geophysics section moved away from its beginnings in atmospheric physics work and concentrated on solid earth geophysics with an emphasis on seismic studies.

Current major areas of research in astronomy and astrophysics are star and planet formation, evolution of massive stars, high-energy phenomenology and astroparticle physics (building on the historical legacy in cosmic ray physics). Solar physics, Space Weather, and Solar System Planetary Magnetospheres and Moons are among the topics studied by DIAS researchers at Dunsink Observatory. The Astronomy and Astrophysics section is led by Prof. Peter T. Gallagher, who leads the Solar Physics and Space Weather research group and is Director of Dunsink Observatory. Prof Caitríona M. Jackman leads the Planetary Magnetospheres research group.

Geophysics research include global teleseismic studies of the whole Earth, seismic studies of volcanoes, detailed studies of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational and magnetic fields using satellite and ground-based data, and local surveys in Ireland and elsewhere exploring fundamental geophysical processes using a variety of techniques.

DIAS and Geological Survey Ireland operate the Irish National Seismic Network together.

<text>The Catalan Opening is a chess opening where White plays d4 and c4 and fianchettoes the white bishop on g2. A common opening sequence is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3, although various other openings can transpose into the Catalan. The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;ECO&quot;) lists codes E01–E09 for lines with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2; other lines are part of E00.

In the Catalan, White adopts a combination of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit and Réti Opening. White combines the space-gaining moves d4 and c4 with g3, preparing to fianchetto the king&#x27;s bishop. This places pressure mainly on the queenside while hoping to keep the white king safe in the long-term. The c4-pawn can become vulnerable, however, and White might have to sacrifice a pawn.

Black has two main approaches to play against the Catalan: in the Open Catalan Black plays ...dxc4 and can either try to hold on to the pawn with ...b5 or give it back for extra time to free their game. In the Closed Catalan, Black does not capture on c4; their game can be somewhat for a while, but is quite . Additionally, Black has ways to avoid the Catalan.

The Catalan has had proponents at the highest level in chess, with Vladimir Kramnik, Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen all employing the opening in their World Chess Championship title games. A number of other grandmasters have successfully played the Catalan, including Fabiano Caruana, Daniil Dubov, Anish Giri and Ding Liren.
==History==
The Catalan derives its name from Catalonia, after tournament organisers at the 1929 Barcelona tournament asked Savielly Tartakower to create a new variation in homage to the area&#x27;s chess history. It had been played a few times before Tartakower&#x27;s usage in the tournament, however: for instance, Réti–Leonhardt, Berlin 1928 transposed into an Open Catalan. The opening cemented itself in the repertoire of leading players of the 1930s and 1940s, such as world champions Jose Raul Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine and Mikhail Botvinnik, as well as top grandmasters such as Salo Flohr, Paul Keres and Samuel Reshevsky.

The Catalan came to prominence at the top level when both Garry Kasparov and Viktor Korchnoi played it in their Candidates Semifinal match in London in 1983: five games of the eleven-game match featured the Catalan.

In 2004, Ruben Felgaer won a tournament celebrating the 75th anniversary of Barcelona 1929 and the birth of the Catalan Opening, ahead of Grandmasters (GMs) Viktor Korchnoi, Mihail Marin, Lluis Comas and Viktor Moskalenko and International Master Manel Granados. Each game in the tournament, which was also held in Barcelona, began with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.g3 Nf6.

With its use by Vladimir Kramnik, the Catalan gained a good deal of attention by high-level GMs in the 2010s. Kramnik played the opening three times in the World Chess Championship 2006. The Catalan was also played four times by Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship 2010; in both instances, the opponent was Veselin Topalov, and in each instance, White scored two more points than Black.

Magnus Carlsen began to employ the Catalan as his main opening in the late 2010s, most notably using it in the second game of the 2021 World Chess Championship against Ian Nepomniachtchi, and used it extensively at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2022.

==Open Catalan, Classical Line==
The Open Catalan, Classical Line (&quot;ECO&quot; code E05) consists of the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Nf3 Be7. White sacrifices the pawn for a lead in . Without a black pawn on d5, White&#x27;s bishop hinders Black&#x27;s development. The Open Catalan line has been a favorite of Anatoly Karpov and Efim Geller as Black and of Oleg Romanishin as White. Usually, White will recover the pawn with Qc2 and then a4, Ne5, or Qa4+. In order to hold the pawn, Black will have to seriously weaken the queenside with ...a6 and ...b5.

<text>Michel Christopher &quot;Christoph&quot; Meili (born 21 April 1968) is a Swiss-American whistleblower and former security professional. In 1997, Meili illegally disclosed to third parties that Swiss bank Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) was destroying documentation of Holocaust-era assets. After a federal arrest warrant, a set of fines, and death threats were issued to him, Meili fled Switzerland to the United States by right of asylum in late 1997, returning to his home country in 2009.

His disclosure was one of the factors prompting a US$1.25 billion settlement between multiple Swiss banks and Jewish victims in August 1998. Meili was entitled to $750,000 of the settlement. He returned to Switzerland having spent all his settlement money and to mixed reception by Swiss papers.

In early 1997, Meili was working as a night guard at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in Zürich. He discovered that officials at UBS were destroying documents about orphaned assets, believed to be credit balances of deceased Jewish clients whose heirs&#x27; whereabouts were unknown, as well as books from the German Reichsbank. They listed stock accounts for companies in business during The Holocaust, including BASF, Degussa, and Degesch. They listed real-estate records for Berlin property that had been seized by the Nazis, placed in Swiss accounts, and then claimed to be owned by UBS. Destruction of such documents is against Swiss laws. The documents Meili saved reportedly predate the Nazi period, dating from 1897 to 1927. On 8 January 1997, he took some bank files home. After a telephone conversation, he handed them over to a local Jewish organization, which brought the documents to the police, and eventually to the press, which published the document destruction on 14 January 1997. The Zürich authorities opened a judicial investigation against Meili for suspected violations of the Swiss laws on banking secrecy, which is a prosecutable offense &quot;ex officio&quot; in Switzerland.

After Meili and his family reported receiving death threats, they fled to the United States and were granted political asylum via private bill. According to news reports, Meili and his family are believed to be the only Swiss nationals ever to receive political asylum in the United States. On 13 January 1998, lawyer Ed Fagan filed suit against UBS on behalf of the Jewish victims, in the amount of US$2,560,000,000. On 13 August 1998, a settlement was reached between the Swiss banks and the Jewish plaintiffs totaling US$1.25 billion. Fagan was disbarred in New York and New Jersey for failing to pay court fines and fees, and for stealing client money and escrow trust funds from Holocaust survivors. Later in 1998 the investigations of the justice of Zürich against Meili for allegedly breaking the laws on bank secrecy were cancelled, but Meili did not return to his homeland until 2003. His marriage ended in divorce in February 2002. In September 2003 he visited his family in Switzerland. In &quot;Die Weltwoche&quot;, a Swiss newspaper, Meili criticized Fagan for having purportedly &quot;instrumentalized&quot; him and letting him down. He claimed to have never received the US$1 million that he was due according to their agreement after settling with the Swiss banks in 1998. However, according to a report by the Swiss magazine &quot;Facts&quot; (17 March 2005), Meili did receive US$750,000.

Meili studied communication sciences at Chapman University after his arrival in California. After earning his college degree in May 2004, he found employment in the security sector. On 14 May 2005 he became a naturalized United States citizen. In an interview with the Swiss newspaper &quot;Sonntagsblick&quot; on 21 October 2006, however, Meili re-iterated his criticism of Fagan and the Jewish organizations who had once championed him, stating again they had let him down. Meili, who then lived in Southern California, stated in an interview that he was working for a minimum wage. In 2009, divorced from his wife, Meili returned to Switzerland.

==Effect of whistleblowing==
In his book &quot;Imperfect Justice&quot;, activist Stuart Eizenstat claimed the &quot;Meili Affair&quot; was important in the decision of Swiss banks to participate in the process of reparations for victims of Nazi looting during World War II. He wrote that the affair &quot;did more than anything to turn the Swiss banks into international pariahs by linking their dubious behavior during and after the War to the discovery of a seemingly unapologetic attempt to cover it up now by destroying documents.&quot; Eizenstat indicates that the affair influenced the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) decision to create a Humanitarian Fund for the Victims of the Holocaust, and that the Fund was suggested to the SBA by Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse. as well as one of a series of events influencing the London Conference on Nazi Gold (1997).

==Filmography==
Daniel von Aarburg filmed the events, and the documentary &quot;Affäre Meili - Ein Whistleblower zwischen Moral und Milliarden&quot; premiered in mid-August 2018.

<doc id="1222711" wikidata="Q510109" url="?curid=1222711" title="Daigo Fukuryū Maru">
<text>was a Japanese tuna fishing boat with a crew of 23 men which was contaminated by nuclear fallout from the United States Castle Bravo thermonuclear weapon test at Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954.

The crew suffered acute radiation syndrome (ARS) for a number of weeks after the Bravo test in March. All recovered from the immediate effects of the American test detonation except for Kuboyama Aikichi, the boat&#x27;s chief radioman, who died on September 23, 1954, from complications of radiation sickness. Kuboyama is considered the first victim of the hydrogen bomb and of test shot Castle Bravo.

==Early days and final voyage==
Built in March 1947 and launched from Koza, Wakayama, the boat was originally named . It was a bonito boat and moored in Misaki Fishing Harbor, Kanagawa Prefecture. It was later remodeled into a tuna fishing boat. In 1953, it moved to Yaizu Port, Shizuoka Prefecture, with a new name, &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, translated as &quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot; or the &quot;Fifth Lucky Dragon&quot;.

The &quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot; took five ocean voyages, the last of which began on January 22, 1954, and ended on March 14 of that year. The crew set off to go fishing in the Midway Sea near Midway Atoll, but when they lost most of their trawl nets to the sea, they altered their course southward near the Marshall Islands and encountered fallout from the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll on March 1.

A map of the varying location of the boat in the days leading up to and after the day of the explosion is available. On March 1, the map depicts the vessel very near to the border of the US Navy issued &quot;danger zone notice&quot; dated October 10, 1953. Following March 1, the vessel charted a practically straight geodesic course back to its home port of Yaizu, passing the same latitude as Wake Island between March 4 and 6 and arriving at Yaizu on March 14.

The source of the map does not state how the map was created, that is, it does not state that the ship&#x27;s log was consulted in the creation of the map, nor does it provide the navigator&#x27;s measurements with the compass and sextant of the period. The exact position of the ship on the day of the explosion is therefore uncertain. Contemporary references give a figure of &quot;80 miles (130 km) east of Bikini Atoll&quot; without stating the method by which the distance was computed. According to a 1997 paper by Martha Smith-Norris, the ship was operating &quot;14 miles&quot; outside the 57,000 square mile &quot;Danger Area&quot;, and it was not detected by radar or visual spotter planes.

==Events surrounding March 1, 1954==


The &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; (&quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot;) encountered the fallout from the U.S. Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll, near the Marshall Islands, on March 1, 1954. When the test was held, the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; was catching fish outside the danger zone that the U.S. government had declared in advance. However, the test was more than twice as powerful as predicted, and changes in weather patterns blew nuclear fallout, in the form of a fine ash, outside the danger zone. On that day, the sky in the west lit up like a sunset. The &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; was not damaged by the shock wave from the blast. However, several hours later white, radioactive dust made up of radioactive particles of coral and sand fell upon the ship. The fishermen attempted to escape from the area, but they took almost six hours to retrieve fishing gear from the sea and process fish (mainly shark and tuna) caught on the lines, exposing themselves to the radioactive fallout. The fishermen scooped the highly radioactive dust into bags with their bare hands. One fisherman, Oishi Matashichi, reported that he &quot;took a lick&quot; of the dust that fell on his ship, likening the falling material to 粉雪 (&quot;powdered snow&quot;) and describing it as gritty but with no taste. The dust stuck to their bodies and the ship, entering their nasal passages and ears, irritating their eyes and collecting inside their underwear. Radiation sickness symptoms appeared later that day. Due to this, the fishermen called the white ash &quot;shi no hai&quot; (死の灰, death ash). The ash that fell upon the ship carried strontium-90, cesium-137, and uranium-237.

===Events between March 2–14===

During their return, the crew began showing symptoms of radiation poisoning as early as the evening after exposure. They experienced pain, headaches, nausea, dizziness, and diarrhea. Their eyes began to turn red and developed an itchy mucus. One crewman decided to keep some of the ash in order to have it analysed on their arrival home, but it was kept in a pouch hung from one of the bunks and was therefore in close proximity to the sleeping men for the duration of their return. Later analysis of the sample by, among others, Tokyo University determined that the ash was caused by a hydrogen bomb. The announcement of this news came as a large surprise to the Americans as they had persistently kept their nuclear experimentation secret.

By the third day, the men began to develop small blisters on their bodies that had been touched by the radioactive ash. Their faces also began to turn dark. A week into their return journey, their hair began to fall out. On March 11, the ship encountered rough seas causing them to dock late on March 14. This late arrival fortunately caused the contaminated fish to stay within the ship until the next morning. Thus, they were able to throw away much of the tuna once they discovered the radiation.

===Events after return to Yaizu port===

After their arrival, the men went to the Yaizu Public Hospital, where the surgeon, Oi Toshiaki, applied a zinc ointment to their faces and sent them home. On March 15, 1954, engineer Yamamoto, deckhand Masuda, and 5 others who were said to make up the &quot;elderly&quot; crew members were sent to the Tokyo University Hospital for treatment. There, they tested Masuda&#x27;s bone marrow and found his white blood cell count at half the normal level. Japanese biophysicist Nishiwaki Yasushi immediately traveled from Osaka to Yaizu to examine the crew and their boat. He quickly concluded that they had been exposed to radioactive fallout and wrote a letter to the chief of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) asking for more information on how to treat the crew. The crew members, suffering from nausea, headaches, burns, pain in the eyes, bleeding from the gums, and other symptoms, were diagnosed with acute radiation syndrome. The US did not respond to Nishiwaki&#x27;s letter or letters from other Japanese scientists requesting information and help. However, the United States did dispatch two medical scientists to Japan to study the effects of fallout on the ship&#x27;s crew and to assist their doctors. The remaining crew members were quarantined in Yaizu North Hospital with all of their clothes and belongings buried on the property. High levels of radiation were found in the men&#x27;s hair and nails, and so the hospital was forced to cut off the rest of their hair.

There is a hint of criticism from one of the crewmembers, Oishi Matashichi, aimed at the then Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki in his book, citing the fact that despite the lingering resentment towards the US over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and the suspicion that US officials were only interested in research rather than attempting to cure anyone of their subsequent bombing-related ailments, Foreign Minister Okazaki is said to have spoken frequently to the crew about the need for the Americans to be present during treatment. Indeed, Oishi goes as far as to say &quot;The Foreign Minister usually stood on the American side, and it appeared that he was the American Foreign Minister (rather than our own).&quot;

The men were all transferred to the Tokyo University Hospital. There, they would remain for 14 months or more in some cases. They were subjected to daily examinations and multiple blood samples. Bone marrow was also drawn from different areas in the men. Their red and white blood cells had dropped significantly, causing internal bleeding and bloody stools. They had constant high fevers, bled from their noses and gums, and had persistent diarrhea. Their sperm counts also fell to low numbers or, in some cases, to none. For their treatment, the men were prescribed bed rest and given large quantities of antibiotics and blood transfusions. Dr. Morita Hisao reported that the men had developed acute panmyelosis, a disease that attacked their bone marrow destroying its ability to generate blood.
Around August 20, Kuboyama Aikichi&#x27;s condition deteriorated. By August 29, he fell into critical condition after developing meningitis. He became delirious and violent, having to be tied to a bed on the floor. Kuboyama soon fell into a coma and developed pneumonia. On September 23, he became the first member of the crew to die from complications of radiation sickness. The remaining 22 crew members were released from the hospital on May 20, 1955 after 14 months. They received yearly checkups to monitor the toll of long-term radiation sickness complications.

==Health history of the surviving crew==
Like the hibakusha, survivors of atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; crew were stigmatized because of the Japanese public&#x27;s fear of those exposed to radiation (it was commonly believed to be contagious). The crew tried to stay quiet about their exposure for decades, beginning with their discharge from the hospital. Some crew members moved away from their homes to make a fresh start. However, unlike the hibakusha, the &quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5&quot; crew did not qualify for the medical care benefits that the survivors of the atomic bomb were given.

* After being released from the hospital, Oishi Matashichi left his hometown to open a dry cleaning business. Beginning in the 1980s, he frequently gave talks advocating nuclear disarmament. His first child was stillborn, which Oishi attributed to his exposure to radiation. In 1992, Oishi developed cirrhosis of the liver but recovered after successful surgery. In 2011, he published a book titled, &quot;The Day the Sun Rose in the West: Bikini, the Lucky Dragon and I&quot; in English. The book combines his personal story, the story of the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, and declassified documents between the Japanese and American governments about the fallout&#x27;s damage.
* Former crew member Susumu Misaki opened a tofu shop after the incident. He died of lung cancer in Shizuoka Prefecture at the age of 92.
* Another crew member, Masayoshi Kawashima (川島正義), tried to earn a living making pouches after his release from the hospital, but it failed. Issues in his personal life led to a divorce. Kawashima returned to fishing but died soon after aged 47.

* Crew member Sanjirō Masuda (増田三次郎) died aged 54 after contracting various illnesses and diseases, including cirrhosis of the liver, sepsis, stomach ulcers and diabetes.
* Crew member Yūichi Masuda (増田祐一) died aged 55 after collapsing suddenly in the field in which he was working and died less than 10 days later. Again, cirrhosis of the liver was cited as a cause.
* Crew member Shinzō Suzuki (鈴木慎三) died on 18 June 1982, aged 57, on the Meishin Expressway (名神高速公路) after the truck he was driving was involved in a rear-end collision, and burned to death in the wreckage. When Oishi Matashichi contacted his widow (the accident happened 4 years before he discovered the fact because they had lost contact), she told him that her husband had suffered from general weakness. Cirrhosis of the liver was once again mentioned.
* Crew member Hiroshi Kozuka (小塚博) was diagnosed with stomach cancer in March 1986. He, like some of the other crew, had been regularly attending annual check-ups, which began in 1957 at the National Institute of Radiological Science (放射線医学総合研究所) in Chiba (千葉市). Despite having his regular check-up just a couple of weeks before, the cancer was diagnosed by a local doctor shortly after stomach pains began and didn&#x27;t subside. He underwent surgery and had two-thirds of his stomach removed. Recovering well, he was diagnosed with pneumonia just 1 week later.
* In 1987, chief engineer Chūji Yamamoto (山本忠司) was admitted to a hospital in Gamagori (蒲郡) the day before he was due to undergo his latest annual check-up. He was diagnosed with liver, colon, and lung cancer. Oishi Matashichi visited Yamamoto in the hospital along with another crew member, Tsutsui (筒井), on 21 February 1987, only for Yamamoto to succumb to his cancer 13 days later on 6 March 1987, aged 60.
* Crew member Kaneshige Takagi (高木兼重) succumbed to liver cancer aged 66; the news filtered through from Hoto Island (保戸島, part of Kyūshū) to Oishi Matashichi in December 1989. During the phone call received from the wife of Takagi, she mentioned that an employee at the crematorium told her that the bones of Takagi after cremation were the most thin and fragile that they&#x27;d ever seen.

==Responsibility and remembrance==
The US government refused to disclose the fallout&#x27;s composition due to &quot;national security&quot;, as the fallout&#x27;s isotopic ratios—namely a percentage of uranium-237—could reveal the design of the Castle Bravo device through radio-chemical analysis. For instance, Joseph Rotblat may have deduced the staging nature of the device by studying the ratio and presence of tell-tale isotopes present in the fallout. As of 1954, the Soviet Union had not yet been successful with thermonuclear staging and such information could have assisted in their development of a thermonuclear weapon. Lewis Strauss, the head of the AEC, issued several denials that claimed the United States were not to blame. He also hypothesized that the lesions on the fishermen&#x27;s bodies were not caused by radiation but by the chemical action of the caustic burnt lime that is produced when coral is calcined, and that they were inside the danger zone. He told President Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary that the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; may have been a &quot;red spy outfit&quot;, commanded by a Soviet agent intentionally exposing the ship&#x27;s crew and catch in order to embarrass the USA and gain intelligence on the test&#x27;s device.

Later, the United States expanded the danger zone and it was revealed that in addition to the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, many other fishing boats were in the expanded zone at the time. It is estimated that about one hundred fishing boats were contaminated to some degree by fallout from the test. Despite denials by Lewis Strauss concerning the extent of the claimed contamination of the fish caught by &quot;Daigo Fukuryu Maru&quot; and other ships, the FDA later imposed rigid restrictions on tuna imports.

At first, the US claimed that the extent of the &quot;Lucky Dragon&quot; incident contamination was trivial. Later, the United States paid Kuboyama&#x27;s widow and children the equivalent in yen of about $2,800 ($26,700 in 2020). The tragedy of the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; gave rise to a fierce anti-nuclear movement in Japan, rising especially from the fear that the contaminated fish had entered the market. The Japanese and U.S. governments negotiated a compensation settlement, with the transfer to Japan of a compensation of $15,300,000, of which the fishery received a compensation of $2 million, with the surviving crew receiving about ¥ 2 million each, ($5,550 in 1954, $52,800 in 2020). It was also agreed that the victims would not be given &quot;hibakusha&quot; status. The Japanese government pledged that it would not pursue further reparations from the U.S. government.

In the 1990s, Oishi Matashichi worked to erect a memorial for the tuna impacted by the fallout. He gathered small donations and raised enough to erect a stone memorial called &quot;The Tuna Epitaph&quot; at the Tsukiji market. While the stone was being moved they erected a metal plaque within the market.

== Post-contamination ==

When it was first docked at the fish market in Yaizu, the ship gave off radiation that could be detected 100 feet from the ship. A Geiger counter detected 120 milliroentgens on the deck of the ship. These high numbers caused Dr. Shiokawa to order the ship moved to Yaizu&#x27;s north pier and guarded by police. The various items aboard the ship, from cabbage leaves to dead cockroaches, were tested and showed high levels of radiation.

On March 22, the future of the ship became a debate between the U.S. military, the Japanese government and scientists. The United States military proposed moving the ship to their base at Yokosuka to be disposed of. Minister without portfolio Ando Masazumi argued that the ship should be kept for three months, parts saved for scientific research, and the rest of the ship scuttled. Professor Nakaizumi of Tokyo University argued that the Japanese government should purchase the ship for residual radiation research. On August 22, the ship was purchased by the Japanese government and towed to the Tokyo University of Fisheries. In 1956, the ship was refitted and renamed as &quot;Hayabusa Maru&quot; and put to use as a training vessel.

The public outcry against the government&#x27;s handling of the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, its crew, and the lack of information about fallout kindled an anti-nuclear and anti-American movement. After the ship docked and received national attention, municipal, prefecture and national assemblies passed resolutions in support of limiting or banning nuclear testing. After the death of Kuboyama, the movement expanded. In Tokyo, the National Council for a Petition Movement to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen bombs was founded. This group began an annual ban-the-bomb convention in 1955. At the first World Conference, a new organization called the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs formed to expand the movement and moved to include the hibakusha. The anti-nuclear movement eventually culminated in demonstrations against the United States-Japan Security Treaty in 1960.

On June 11, 1970, the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; received media attention as it still sat in garbage within the canal. The area was cleaned up and made into a park. The ship was pulled from the water and put on public display as a symbol of opposition to nuclear weapons in an exhibit hall in Tokyo.

The &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; was deemed safe for public viewing and was preserved in 1976. It is now on display in Tokyo at the Tokyo Metropolitan &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot; Exhibition Hall.

==Media==
* The 1954 Toho film &quot;Godzilla&quot; was inspired in part by this event. The ship itself appears on a poster in the 2001 film &quot;Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack&quot;, which also features Godzilla coming ashore and wreaking havoc in the Yaizu area.
* The book and anime &quot;Tobiuo no Boya wa Byoki desu&quot; was based on this event. 
* A poem, (&quot;The Japanese Fishermen&quot;), was written in 1956 by Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet Ran about the events.
* A short novel, &quot;Ash of Bikini&quot; by Lev Petrov and Arkady Strugatsky, closely following the incident, was published in 1956 in Russian. Part of it was republished in a tutorial for schoolchildren nine years later.
* Ralph Lapp wrote &quot;The Voyage of the Lucky Dragon&quot;, which was published in 1958. It was reviewed on the front page of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.
* A film version of the events, (1959), was directed and screenwritten by Kaneto Shindo, and produced by Kindai Eiga Kyokai and .
* The 1955 radio play by the West German Wolfgang Weyrauch was inspired by these events.
* Artist Tarō Okamoto created the painting (&quot;Burning People&quot;) in response to the &quot;Lucky Dragon No. 5.&quot; The painting was displayed in the Fifth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in 1959. He also included the ship in his mural &quot;Myth of Tomorrow&quot; in Shibuya railway station.
* West German composer Herbert Eimert composed from 1957 to 1962 at the Studio for Electronic Music (WDR), in which the grave inscription of the fisherman is first narrated by Richard Münch and then repeated and manipulated in an electroacoustic manner.

<text>The Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) (; ; ), may refer to a government-defined &quot;political definition&quot; of the urban region surrounding the metropolis of Bangkok, or the built-up area, i.e., urban agglomeration of Bangkok, Thailand, which varies in size and shape, and gets filled in as development expands.

The political definition is defined as the metropolis and the five adjacent provinces of Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani, Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan, and Samut Sakhon.

== Area and population ==

The Bangkok Metropolitan Region (political definition) covers an area of 7,762 km2.

Due to the success of the service and tourism industry in Bangkok, the city has gained in popularity for work among provincial Thais from the rural areas and with people from many countries in the Indochina region as well as many South Asian countries. Since around the turn of the century, there has been a large influx of Indians into Thailand (especially Punjabis, Gujaratis, Tamils and Pashtuns), and also Persians, Portuguese, Khmer Krom, Mons, Chinese, as well as others emigrating to Thailand and Bangkok. There are large numbers of workers who legally reside outside the metropolitan area and travel into the city for day jobs. The population of the Bangkok metropolis (&quot;the city&quot;) increases to nine million during the day, from eight million at night. The morning influx into the greater metropolitan region is not very significant, rather the influx is seasonal depending upon crop seasons in the rest of the country.

==Urban build-up==

Bangkok has seen rapid urbanization since its population reached two million in the 1960s. Since the 1980s, greater Bangkok&#x27;s built-up areas have spilled beyond Bangkok&#x27;s borders to neighboring provinces, initially to the north and south. Despite a general suburbanization trend, Bangkok remained centralized and the city core remained extremely dense until the early 2000s as heavy commuter traffic limited choices. The countryside between once independent towns and the capital became ever more filled in, with the advent and expansion of urban rail transit, as well as cheap credit enabling automobile adoption by the working class. The outward push of suburbanization has intensified as park and ride lots near train stations have sprung up.

In a manner similar to Los Angeles, Bangkok is transforming into a region where traffic flows in all directions rather than simply to the central core, as it once did. Suburbanziation has swallowed ever more fields and swamps, though even parts of Bangkok itself are not built-up. The first areas to suburbanize were in Pathum Thani, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakan Provinces. Other areas more recently have agglomerated in Samut Sakhon and Nakhon Pathom. Samut Prakan, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani and Samut Sakhon all have historic city centers.

Due to a lack of strict zoning laws, the metropolitan areas&#x27; growth appears haphazard. Central areas like Yaowarat, Siam, Sukhumvit, and Sathorn have seen skyrocketing land speculation as foreign investors are allowed to own condominiums, giving rise to Manhattanization. At the same time, fringe areas are being developed and the boundaries are no longer visible between each provincial city center. Due to the speed of this urban sprawl over the past twenty years, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has sought to tackle rising problems of commute times, pollution, and deteriorating air quality. Air quality has been declining year by year, and the city still lacks an effective mass transit network outside Bangkok proper and a clean and effective plan to resolve environmental issues.

* https://dopa.go.th/banner_link/fileDownload/130 (Dept Provincial Affairs Dec 2016)
* DOPA 2022 via (includes registered non-Thai residents a bit less than 1 million on nationwide citizen waiting list, appears not to include long-stay foreign residents who do not seek citizenship. Thais may only register single location, those retaining upcountry residency are not counted in region, regardless where they live and work. However, it is interesting to see suburban registration increases while Bangkok does not.) 
* The 2010 Census explicitly counted Thais and those with legal permanent residency status where they resided during the count. The census failed to count long-stay migrants and expats without legal permanent resident status, who are estimated to number from &quot;perhaps [two million]&quot; to &quot;no less [sic] than 3 million&quot; nationwide. Therefore, greater Bangkok&#x27;s actual population easily surpassed 15 million by the 2010 census.
* The Department of Provincial Affairs :th:กรมการปกครอง (DPA) &quot;Grommágaan Bpòkkrong&quot; registers Thai population and produces its own statistics separate from National Statistics Office (NSO). Millions live in Bangkok region with upcountry registration. Expats, migrants, those in refugee camps, and &quot;native&quot; ethnic tribes without Thai nationality may have not been counted DPA until 2016, when separate Thai nationality and Non-Thai was tabulated. The total registered population of 64,076,033 in 2011 was some 1.4 million fewer than census figures a year earlier. Thailand is still (2013) trying to officially register migrant workers.
* As of post-coup 2014, Thailand&#x27;s Department of Employment released figures showing that 408,507 legal workers from three neighboring states, and 1,630,279 Burmese, 40,546 Laotians, and 153,683 Cambodians without legal work authorization were working and residing in Thailand. Nevertheless, some 180,000 Cambodians were said to have left Thailand post-coup due to rumors of a crackdown on illegals, indicating government figures may have been undercounted.

==Economy==
For FY 2022, Bangkok Metropolitan Region had a combined economic output of 8.1 trillion baht (US$231 billion), or around half of Thailand&#x27;s GDP. Bangkok (BMA) had an economic output of 5.747 trillion baht (US$164 billion). This amounts to a GPP per capita of 634,109 baht (US$18,100), half more than Samut Sakhon province, next in the ranking and more than three times for Nonthaburi province, lowest in the ranking.


==Traffic==
As of 31 October 2012, some 7,384,934 vehicles were registered in the metro area, roughly one vehicle for every two persons. To alleviate the ensuing congestion, massive railway development is ongoing, but its construction is causing large scale disturbance to major thoroughfares.

==Destruction of green space==
Bangkok&#x27;s last undisturbed forested zone, Bang Kachao, in Samut Prakan&#x27;s Phra Pradaeng District, also known as &quot;the green lung&quot; or (; ) (&#x27;pig&#x27;s stomach&#x27;, due to its shape) is threatened by urban sprawl, especially since a new city plan was implemented by Samut Prakan authorities. The plan has changed the pure green area to a &quot;green and white&quot; area, which allows residents to grow crops. Bang Kachao covers over 11,818 rai in six tambons in Phra Pradaeng.

<text>Lélio, ou Le retour à la vie (English: &quot;Lélio, or the Return to Life&quot;), Op. 14b, is a work incorporating music and spoken text by the French composer Hector Berlioz, intended as a sequel to his &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. It is written for a narrator, solo tenor and baritone, mixed chorus, and an orchestra including piano.

Composed in Italy in 1831 and initially performed at the Conservatoire de Paris on December 9, 1832, as &quot;Le retour à la vie, mélologue en six parties,&quot; &quot;Lélio&quot; incorporated pre-existing compositions. Upon Franz Liszt&#x27;s solicitation, it underwent revision for a 1855 performance in Weimar and was published the subsequent year. David Cairns highlights &quot;Lélio&quot; for its unparalleled &quot;immediate impact&quot; within Berlioz&#x27;s catalogue. Its early appeal, rooted in the fusion of Romantic aesthetics and the interplay between declamation and music, has, however, led to its perception as dated, thus its infrequent revival and recording in contemporary times.

== Overview ==

&quot;Lélio&quot; is a kind of sequel to &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and makes use of the famous &quot;idée fixe&quot; (the recurring musical theme symbolising the beloved) from that work. Both the symphony and &quot;Lélio&quot; were inspired by the composer&#x27;s unhappy love affairs, the symphony by Harriet Smithson, &quot;Lélio&quot; by Marie Moke, who had broken off her engagement to Berlioz in order to marry Camille Pleyel, prompting the composer to contemplate suicide. &quot;Lélio&quot; is a record of the composer overcoming his despair and &quot;returning to life&quot; via the consolations of music and literature. Berlioz later revised his intentions, making it seem as if both the symphony and &quot;Lélio&quot; were about Harriet Smithson (she later became his wife). The symphony uses programme music to describe a despairing artist trying to kill himself with an overdose of opium, leading to a series of increasingly terrifying visions. The programme of &quot;Lélio&quot; describes the artist wakening from these dreams, musing on William Shakespeare, his sad life, and not having a woman. He decides that if he can&#x27;t put this unrequited love out of his head, he will immerse himself in music. He then leads an orchestra to a successful performance of one of his new compositions and the story ends peacefully.

&quot;Lélio&quot; consists of six musical pieces presented by an actor who stands on stage in front of a curtain concealing the orchestra, chorus and solo singers. The actor&#x27;s dramatic monologues explain the meaning of the music in the life of the artist. The work begins and ends with the &quot;idée fixe&quot; theme, linking &quot;Lélio&quot; to the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;.

==The music==
The six pieces of music are:
Instrumentation: 2 flutes (2nd also piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd also English horn), 2 clarinets, 4 bassoons 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 cornets, 3 trombones, ophicleide, timpani, bass drum, tam-tam, harp, piano (2 and 4 hand), strings

<doc id="1222729" wikidata="Q7439346" url="?curid=1222729" title="Scrumpy">
<text>Scrumpy is a type of cider originating in the West of England, particularly the West Country. Traditionally, the dialect term &quot;scrumpy&quot; was used to refer to what was otherwise called &quot;rough&quot;, a harsh cider made from unselected apples.

Today the term is more often used to distinguish locally made ciders produced in smaller quantities and using traditional methods, from mass-produced branded ciders.

==Etymology==
Various origins of the name &quot;scrumpy&quot; have been proposed. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, which finds the term first used in 1904, derives it from the noun &quot;scrump&quot;, meaning &quot;something withered or dried up&quot;, not specifically apples. Other claimed derivations include a noun &quot;scrimp&quot; with the same meaning, derived from a verb &quot;scrump&quot;, meaning &quot;to steal fruit&quot;. Neither of these meanings is attested in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and the &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot; confirms the existence of the word &quot;scrump&quot; applied to &quot;anything small or undersized&quot;, particularly apples, and notes a related word &quot;scrumpling&quot; for a small apple. It can be applied to basic homemade ciders as well as to commercially produced and marketed varieties.

In 1997 a legal case on trademark law was fought in Ireland between Symonds and Showerings (Ireland), in which the defendant successfully argued that &quot;scrumpy&quot; was a part of the &quot;commonage&quot; of the language, being a generic term referring to rough dry farmhouse cider.

==Production==
Traditional &quot;rough&quot; was invariably fermented out to absolute dryness, with a strong, full bodied character but no distinguishable apple flavour: in 19th century Devon &quot;rough&quot; was much preferred for home consumption, while sweeter, less alcoholic cider was produced for an &#x27;export&#x27; market outside the county. &quot;Rough&quot; was known as the customary drink of farm labourers in the west of England, who would generally receive up to a quart () daily as an incentive on top of their wages.

Modern scrumpy can be dry or sweet, and is usually still rather than carbonated, but may have some degree of carbonation. However, it tends to be stronger in alcohol and more tannic than most commercial ciders. Due to its traditional methods of production, it is usually very pulpy, and resultantly often cloudy in appearance.

It is produced by pulping and pressing a quantity of apples, and then adding the juice to a vessel with a special lid to ensure the pressure does not rise too much. It may be necessary to add a Campden tablet to prevent undesirable bacterial action, and the vessel must be sanitized. The vessels are sealed and left to ferment for a few months.

==Other uses==
As well as scrumpy made with apples, there also exists pear scrumpy, similar to perry. Scrumpy and Western describes a kind of music from the West Country, where scrumpy is traditionally produced, typified by The Wurzels.

<text>A Help Authoring Tool or HAT is a software program used by technical writers to create online help systems.

==Functions==
The basic functions of a Help Authoring Tool (HAT) can be divided into the following categories:

===File input===
HATs obtain their source text either by importing it from a file produced by another program, or by allowing the author to create the text within the tool by using an editor. File formats that can be imported vary from HAT to HAT. Acceptable file formats can include ASCII, HTML, OpenOffice Writer and Microsoft Word, and compiled Help formats such as Microsoft WinHelp and Microsoft Compiled HTML Help.

===Help output===
The output from a HAT can be either a compiled Help file in a format such as WinHelp (*.HLP) or Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (*.CHM), or noncompiled file formats such as Adobe PDF, XML, HTML or JavaHelp.

===Auxiliary functions===
Some HATs provide extra functions such as:

* Automatic or assisted Index generation
* Automatic Table of Contents
* Spelling checker
* Image editing
* Image hotspot editing
* Import and export of text in XML files, for exchange with computer-assisted translation programs

==Common help authoring tools==
Some common HATs include:

* HelpNDoc
* Adobe RoboHelp
* HelpSmith
* Doc-To-Help
* MadCap Flare
* Help &amp; Manual
* Sandcastle
* AsciiDoc

==Related software==
Technical writers often use content management systems and version control systems to manage their work.

<doc id="1222736" wikidata="Q698087" url="?curid=1222736" title="Bone-rank system">
<text>The bone-rank system () was the system of aristocratic rank used in the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. It was used to segregate society, and particularly the layers of the aristocracy, on the basis of their hereditary proximity to the throne and the level of authority they were permitted to wield. The idea of royal blood in other societies is a close analogue to the idea of &quot;sacred bone&quot; in Silla thought.

Bone rank was strictly hereditary, and thus acted as a caste system. The scholar, Lee Ki-baik (1984, p. 43) considers it to have probably been adopted as part of the administrative law introduced from China and promulgated by King Beopheung in 520. However, this likely did nothing but institute in legal fact what was already a society segregated by bloodline and lineage. Although only two of the five known ranks were referred to as &quot;bone&quot; (골, 骨), the term &quot;bone rank&quot; has become widely used to describe the whole system.

A person&#x27;s bone rank status governed not only official status and marriage rights, but also the color of one&#x27;s garments and the maximum dimensions of one&#x27;s dwelling and carriage. These criteria are described in detail in the 12th century Korean history &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, particularly its Monographs (&quot;ji&quot; 志), book 2 (ranks and offices). The &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;&#x27;s depiction of Silla life, however, has often been criticized for being excessively static. Unfortunately, since other sources are scarce, it is difficult to judge what sort of changes may have taken place in the bone rank system over the centuries.

== Rank ==

=== Sacred Bone (Seonggol) ===
According to &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, &quot;the people of Silla divided the period from Hyeokgeose of Silla to Jindeok of Silla into Sacred Bone (Seonggol), and the king after Muyeol of Silla into True Bone (Jingol). The highest level of the bone rank was the &quot;sacred bone&quot;, or seonggol (성골, 聖骨), sometimes termed &quot;hallowed bone&quot; or &quot;holy bone&quot;. There is no specific record on exactly what the distinction between the Sacred Bone and the True Bone is set by, but is generally accepted that only the earliest kings were referred to as Seonggol. Because of this closed system of caste, when king Jinpyeong of Silla had no son and male heir whom he could pass the crown to, Queen Seondeok of Silla became the first woman to ascend the throne. And after that, Kim Chun-chu, also referred to as Muyeol of Silla ascended to the king as a Jingol status and since then, Jingol took over the throne for 281 years until Silla&#x27;s demise.

=== True Bone (Jingol) ===
Below the sacred bone came the &quot;true bone&quot;, or jingol (진골, 眞骨). Members of the true bone could hold any official position, up to the level of full minister. They could also attain office rank up to the highest, &quot;ibolchan&quot; (이벌찬). After the sacred bone rank was abolished under King Muyeol, only those holding the true bone rank could become a king.

=== Head Ranks ===
Below the &quot;true bone&quot; came the head ranks (두품, 頭品), of which only the 6th, 5th and 4th are attested, 6th being the highest. The origins of these lower head rank classes and what defined one‘s status as such are obscure and still debated among scholars. As the &quot;jingol&quot; were prohibited from marrying into the lower ranks, though they could take concubines from them, it is feasible that one source of the head rank six were the children born from unions between &quot;jingol&quot; fathers and lower ranking concubines. In any case, members of the head rank six could rise to the position of vice-minister (&quot;gyeong&quot;, 경, 卿) and as high as the 6th level of office rank, achan (아찬, 阿餐) (two higher ranks of &quot;jungachan&quot; (중아찬, 重阿餐) and &quot;sajung achan&quot; (사중아찬, 四重阿餐) were later supplemented to that of &quot;achan&quot; but these still fell within the 6th level). Members of head ranks four and five could rise only to minor posts. Members of head rank five could reach the 10th level of office rank, &quot;daenaema&quot; (대내마, 大奈麻), while members of head rank four could attain only the 12th level of office rank, &quot;daesa&quot; (대사, 大舍). There were 17 levels of office rank (also known as &#x27;capital rank&#x27;) altogether. One scholar has proposed that, &quot;head-ranks three, two, and one, if they ever formally existed, must have designated the ... non-privileged general populace.&quot;

== Evaluations ==
The frustrated ambitions of the head rank six class in particular seem to have played a prominent role in the politics of the late Silla period. Many men of head rank six status, proscribed from rising too high in the Silla administrative system defined by the bone rank system, sought to bypass this by studying Confucianism (either in Silla or abroad in Tang China) or else turned to careers in Buddhism. The most prominent of the head rank six figures was undoubtedly Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn, who following an illustrious career in China returned to Silla only to see his attempts at administrative reform rebuffed by an entrenched aristocracy. In the early 10th century the nascent state of Goryeo, which succeeded Goguryeo, tapped into the head rank six intellectuals from Silla and Later Baekje to man its bureaucracy.

The bone rank system&#x27;s extreme rigidity certainly helped to weaken Silla toward the end of the Unified Silla period, although numerous other factors were at play. After the fall of Silla, the bone rank system was abolished entirely by the Goryeo dynasty, although different and somewhat more flexible caste systems persisted until near the end of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 19th century.

<text>¡Alarma! was a Mexican news magazine published by Publicaciones Llegó. It specialized in graphics and shocking pictures of crime and corpses, including murder victims and traffic accidents, as well as pictures of scantily clad women.

==History and profile==
Pitched by journalist and writer Carlos Samoaya Lizárraga as a magazine exclusively about crime, &quot;¡Alarma!&quot; was launched on April 17, 1963, with an initial print run of 3000 copies per week. The magazine became notorious for publishing graphic images of corpses and using shocking headlines such as &quot;Raptola, violola y matola con una pistola&quot; (&quot;He kidnapped her, raped her, and killed her with a gun&quot;).

&quot;¡Alarma!&quot; got an unexpected boost in 1964, when it publicised the case of the González Valenzuela sisters, who forced women into prostitution, killed them, and repeatedly bribed authorities to avoid arrest. The case and the ensuing court process, covered by journalist Jesús Sánches Hermosillo, became a nationwide media circus. After publishing the incident&#x27;s graphic details, &quot;¡Alarma!&quot; increased its print run from 140,000 to 500,000 copies per week.

The magazine enjoyed another sales boost during coverage of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake&#x27;s aftermath, which increased the magazine&#x27;s print run to 2-2,5 million copies per week. It was also printed in countries such as the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Japan. The magazine was cancelled in 1986 due to a political standoff between Publicaciones Llegó and the Mexican government but returned in 1991 as &quot;El nuevo Alarma!&quot;.

&quot;¡Alarma!&quot;&#x27;s final issue was published on February 17, 2014, one month before the death of its editor-in-chief Miguel Ángel Rodríguez Vázquez due to a heart attack. 

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;Alármala de tos&quot; on Botellita de Jerez&#x27;s eponymous debut album was inspired by the typical kind of violent and macabre stories published by &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;.

<text>The French Guiana national football team () is the regional football team of the French overseas department and region of French Guiana, and is controlled by the Ligue de football de la Guyane, the local branch of the French Football Federation.

==Overview==
As an overseas department of the French Republic, it is an integral part of France and thus not a member of FIFA. French Guiana is therefore not eligible to enter a team in the World Cup independent of France. As full citizens of France, indistinguishable from any other French citizen, French Guianans are eligible to play for the France national football team.

Bernard Lama, Mike Maignan and Florent Malouda are three examples of Guianese players who have played for the France national team; Maignan is currently the first choice goalkeeper for the France national team and won the UEFA Nations league 2020–21 with the team; Lama was a member of the 1998 World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 winning squads while Malouda played for the French team that finished runner-up in the 2006 World Cup.

==CONCACAF==

However, French Guiana is a member of CONCACAF and CFU, and thus eligible for all competitions organized by both. For any purpose outside of World Cup competition, all of the regional continental confederations may allow teams to be entered by territories that are &quot;de jure&quot; part of a country the bulk of which is located in a different continental confederation region.

According to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): &quot;[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them.&quot;

<text>The endomysium, meaning &quot;within the muscle&quot;, is a wispy layer of areolar connective tissue that ensheaths each individual muscle fiber, or muscle cell. It also contains capillaries and nerves. It overlies the muscle fiber&#x27;s cell membrane: the sarcolemma. Endomysium is the deepest and smallest component of muscle connective tissue. This thin layer helps provide an appropriate chemical environment for the exchange of calcium, sodium, and potassium, which is essential for the excitation and subsequent contraction of a muscle fiber.

Endomysium combines with perimysium and epimysium to create the collagen fibers of tendons, providing the tissue connection between muscles and bones by indirect attachment. It connects with perimysium using intermittent perimysial junction plates.

Collagen is the major protein that composes connective tissues like endomysium. Endomysium has been shown to contain mainly type I and type III collagen components, and type IV and type V in very minor amounts. Others have found type IV and type V more common.

The term cardiac skeleton is sometimes considered synonymous with endomysium in the heart, but cardiac skeleton also refers to the combination of the endomysium and perimysium.

== Clinical significance ==
Anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) are present in celiac disease. They do not cause any direct symptoms to muscles, but detection of EMA is useful in the diagnosis of the disease.

<text>Perimysium is a sheath of dense irregular connective tissue that groups muscle fibers into bundles (anywhere between 10 and 100 or more) or fascicles.

Studies of muscle physiology suggest that the perimysium plays a role in transmitting lateral contractile movements. This hypothesis is strongly supported in one exhibition of the existence of &quot;perimysial junctional plates&quot; in ungulate &quot;flexor carpi radialis&quot; muscles. The overall comprehensive organization of the perimysium collagen network, as well as its continuity and disparateness, however, have still not been observed and described thoroughly everywhere within the muscle. Found to have type I, III, VI, and XII collagen.
